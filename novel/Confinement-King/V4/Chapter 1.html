<h3>Chapter 1: Misuzu Kurosawa Can't Stand </h3>

<p><strong>1.1 - The Evil One Cannot Help But Move</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, I had a really bad experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On my way home from school, I was suddenly struck in the back of the head from behind and surrounded by six boys.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I managed to escape by making use of the 『room』 function but if I had not been treated by Torture, I would have been hospitalised by now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The attackers seemed to think that I had kidnapped Fukada Rin, but I can&#8217;t imagine how they got that story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;&#8230; then,Lili. I&#8217;m counting on you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave it to me, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked back at Lili as I put on my shoes at the door and she smiled and gave me a thumbs up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My head is bandaged for good measure, because it would be too suspicious if the stones that were thrown at had no wound. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was yesterday. I thought about taking the day off from school, but I couldn&#8217;t just leave the boys who attacked me like this. There is something that makes them believe that 『Fumio Kijima kidnapped Rin Fukuda』 .</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First of all, I need to identify the attacker and find out who is behind it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili says the attackers can be easily identified by Freesia-san&#8217;s markings and I am sure they will make some moves once I get to school.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Lili is supposed to wash their background.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I opened the front door, Lili opened her mouth as if she had just remembered something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaー&#8230;&#8230;Devi. FumiFumi, you should clear your schedule for tonight, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hm?　Why?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The progress on the track and field is going faster than I thought, Devi. Maybe I’ll take one of the to see FumiFumi tonight, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;ll be fun. I&#8217;m off then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I headed off to school with a fair amount of caution, although I didn&#8217;t think they&#8217;d attack me so early in the morning. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone was glancing at me, as if they were concerned about the bandage on my head. For me, the classroom is never a comfortable place but today was particularly uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve drawn attention to myself. That&#8217;s how I felt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it didn&#8217;t seem to be just the bandages. I could hear many layers of hushed voices.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘seriously&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take my seat and look around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as our gazes meet, there are a few students who quickly look away. After all, they are paying attention to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I stiffened with a strange sense of tension, I saw one large male student stumble towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Kijima, I want to ask you something.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That boy who looked at me and spoke to me in a low voice was Hiratsuka-kun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He is a large judo club member, over 180 cm tall, with a hot and stern or intimidating air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I haven&#8217;t talked to him much as far as I&#8217;m concerned, but it&#8217;s not that we don&#8217;t get on, It&#8217;s just that we haven&#8217;t had any contact. He is a taciturn guy and I am a shy guy, so there was no reason for us to talk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is the rumour true?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rumours?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look around you. Everybody&#8217;s looking at you, aren&#8217;t they? It&#8217;s rumoured that you’re the one who abducted the track and field team members.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a chill run down my spine. I felt as if I should have been pretending to be an onlooker but before I knew it, I had been pulled to the centre of the stage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I recall, Hiratsuka-kun is dating Tashiro-san, the head of the track and field club. If he hears such rumours, it&#8217;s only natural that he can&#8217;t stand still.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up at Hiratsuka-kun as he was staring at me but wasn&#8217;t glaring.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I exhaled heavily and looked back into his eyes.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiratsuka-kun, can you kidnap the whole track team?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think I could at all&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then it’s obvious. If you think I can do what you can&#8217;t do, then you&#8217;re all out of your mind. No&#8230;.. I think my test scores were higher than yours but if you can kidnap someone based on their test scores, then maybe I can.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see, then I’ve only heard something that is baseless&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiratsuka&#8217;s mouth twisted in a wry smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad. But you shouldn&#8217;t talk in such a twisted way. It doesn&#8217;t make a good impression, to be honest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost chuckle to myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;ve had a proper chat with him, but he&#8217;s probably a pretty good guy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to reflect on that. By the way, where did Hiratsuka-kun hear that rumour?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was circulated on SNS by a junior.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From the judo club?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, that’s right. My junior said he heard it from a guy on the football team. He said the manager of the football team was kidnapped and she left a note saying you were the culprit&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wrinkled my brow involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A football club manager? Could it be a girl called Rin Fukuda?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t think so because I don&#8217;t even know her name.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I heard about the football club, I reflexively turned my attention towards Kasuya-kun. For some reason, he was staring at me. Our eyes almost meet, and I hastily lower my eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At about the same time, I heard a crazy voice echoing from the entrance of the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fu, fu, fu-min!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Fujiwara-san had arrived at school. Kurosawa-san, who must have come with her, was standing behind her with a surprised look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hiratsuka-kun chuckled, raised his hand lightly and went back towards his seat. Then Fujiwara-san rushed towards me with great speed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha  happened?! You&#8217;re hurt!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just fell down.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Di,did you go to the hospital?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No! Head injuries are scary! Let&#8217;s go to the hospital right now! My father has a friend who is a doctor in Tokyo! He&#8217;s an authority on brain surgery!　He&#8217;ll fly us there in a helicopter.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Helicopter?!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The whole classroom did a double-take. It wasn&#8217;t a level of overreaction. However, Fujiwara-san cried out loudly, paying no attention to the reactions of those around her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Noooooooo!　Fuーmin will die!　I can&#8217;t live without you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The whispering voices in the classroom had turned into a commotion. Thanks to Fujiwara-san, the talk about the kidnapper of the track team was blown away in a single blow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it resulted in even more attention than before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I──Misuzu Kurosawa walked up to Jun-kun&#8217;s side, watching Mai fussing and shaking Fumio&#8217;s body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jun-kun, Fum&#8230;.Kimojima is injured?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa&#8230;&#8230;it&#8217;s probably the first year boys. I&#8217;m surprised that Kimojima came to school when he is still injured..”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Really,why did you still come to school&#8230;&#8230;Mouu’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Last night, I received a message from a friend in another class saying that [Kimojima seems to be the culprit]. In addition to what I heard from Jun-kun, there are many other stories attached to the story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The case of the abduction of the female track team members is currently the biggest concern for the students at this school. The rumour is spreading very fast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jun-kun, stop those junior students. I don&#8217;t care about Kimojima, but I feel sorry for Mai. It&#8217;s hard for me to pretend I know something&#8230;..and ignore it.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I complained, Jun-kun gave a small shrug and smiled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misuzu is really kind. I understand. I&#8217;ll call those juniors and talk to them during lunchtime.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this the one Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, princess. He is one of the perpetrators who attacked FumiFumi-sama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A first-year classroom in the middle of a lesson.  Freesia and I were looking into the face of one of the boys, whose hair had been bleached to the extent that it looked brown in the sunlight. Of course, no one could see us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The scent of my cervical mucus is clinging to him perfectly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Cervical mucus &#8211; in short, love juice &#8211; is a very territorial thing for the lecherous succubus. They mark their prey so that other succubus won&#8217;t touch them and this time I instructed Freesia to mark those who attacked FumiFumi.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What shall we do? The quickest way to kill them socially is to show them lewd dreams and get them to start masturbating in class?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t do that, Devi. Let him swim around for the rest of the day and see why he attacked FumiFumi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, at the end of first period, the male student stretches,stands up from his chair and takes out his smartphone and begins to look at the screen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Peering over his shoulder at the screen, I see all of his social networking timeline. Amongst the other exchanges, I saw a post that said 『Meet up at lunchtime』. The sender&#8217;s name is Kasuya.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is convenient Devi. Maybe they&#8217;ll all get together, Devi..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this, Freesia tilted her head with a puzzled look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Was it written in that PicoPico?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:Onomatopoeia of a game machine]</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“PicoPico…? Are you a grandma? Nevermind, Devi.” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, princess. Is it okay for me to have this child?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure Devi. But wait a little longer. When it&#8217;s all over, you can just take him and become a milk server or whatever, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I could not wait to see it happen.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I just got a call from Torture. The track team got the 『ponytail』 in their hands as planned. You go back ahead and get ready, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Freesia picked up her skirt a little, bow down and disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as lunchtime began, the brown-haired boy hurriedly stuffed pastries into his mouths and left the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I followed him while floating in the air. He headed for  the stairs leading to the rooftop. Some boys had already gathered there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, hurry up!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eee, I came here pretty quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seven people, including him. The way they talk lightly to each other are the complete opposite of FumiFumi. To borrow Fumihumi&#8217;s expression as it is, they are probably a group of cheerful people.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apart from the brown-haired boy, there is only one person who looks familiar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That one person is FumiFumi&#8217;s enemy, Kasuya. I assumed the rest of them were his juniors. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasuya looks around at the assembled people and opens his mouth in a somewhat reproachful tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Damn it, you guys, don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;be playing with me. The guy from Kimojima is still in good shape, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Is it impossible that he&#8217;s coming to school?”　</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He came and got a bandage on his head.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The juniors look at each other, saying things like [Seriously?] and [That&#8217;s gross].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He got away in the end, but I still cracked his head open and beat him to a pulp, didn&#8217;t I?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You see, that&#8217;s it. The head bleeds a lot, so it&#8217;s not a serious injury, is it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s just fine. We were just talking about how we&#8217;re going to get Rin back when he stops coming to school. Since he came, Let’s beat him up on his way home today too.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the brown-haired one clenched his fist saying this, Kasuya shook his head in dismay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idiots…doing it a second time is not a good idea. Even if the police have their hands full with the kidnapping case, if he had reported it, they would have at least sent someone to investigate.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then how do you expect us to get Rin back?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you know&#8230;the teacher contacted her parents and they replied that Rin is on a trip.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The juniors widened their eyes for a moment and then reacted differently. Some patted their chests in relief. Some made a miffed face. Some shrugged their shoulders as if in dismay.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She really is a&#8230;&#8230;disturbing woman, isn&#8217;t she?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you&#8217;re saying that KimoJima has nothing to do with this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t say he is not irrelevant. He was following Rin around, you know. It&#8217;s just as well, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s like pest control. Spread more rumours that he kidnapped her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it&#8217;s a rumour, I&#8217;ve spread it all over the place&#8230;&#8230;.But Senpai, why are you so obsessed with that thing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When one of the juniors asked him this, Kasuya glared at him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m obsessed! The fact that he&#8217;s dating Mai without knowing how much he&#8217;s worth is also irritating, and recently he&#8217;s been eyeing Misuzu with a lot of interest. I think it&#8217;s best to crush idiots like that before they get the wrong idea.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The juniors expressions of understanding widened as a result of Kasuya&#8217;s comment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I see, so that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s about.You mean for Misuzu-senpai? Senpai, your eyes really change colour when it comes to Misuzu-senpai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, you idiot. There&#8217;s no one better than Misuzu. I&#8217;ve had a crush on her since junior high school.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, the younger students were happily saying, [Huーhu! Pure love!] Then one of the junior members of the group, who seemed particularly good-natured, asked abruptly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh yea, Senpai!　Have you had sex with Misuzu-senpai already?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s with you all of a sudden&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;but yeah..somewhat”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oooo…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasuya looked puzzled for a moment, but the final [somewhat] was clothed in a boastful sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How was it? Was it the best?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course it is! If anything, Misuzu is more into me. I made her squeal and say things like, [Come on in deeper]. Misuzu wants to be fucked relentlessly, so it&#8217;s a bit of hard work.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Amazingー!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasuya proudly rubbed the bridge of his nose and once again addressed his juniors, saying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, spread the word that he&#8217;s the culprit. When Rin comes back, I&#8217;ll talk to her and tell her to go out with one of you guys.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Teruya senpai, what&#8217;s going on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shush&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turn around and put my finger in front of my lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What are you going to do now?　Do you want to compete in next month&#8217;s tournament, even if it&#8217;s just the two of you?　I was having lunch on the roof with Ninagawa, a second year student as we were talking about such topics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, we managed to put together a conversation in which just the two of us would compete and just as we were about to leave the rooftop, I froze with my hand on the doorknob at the sound of a voice coming from the other side of the door.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Junichi-sama&#8217;s voice!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard some of their story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rumour that KimoJima was the one who kidnapped the track and field team was, of course, in my ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s ridiculous. There&#8217;s no way he can do such a big thing. At any rate, even my older sister says it&#8217;s impossible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I don&#8217;t care about KimoJima and if Junichi-sama wants to destroy him, I&#8217;m willing to destroy that thing with him. But the most unforgivable thing in the stories I heard was the fact that Junichi-sama was defiled by Kurosawa Misuzu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No&#8230;&#8230;I know that. I know that woman who is now Junichi-sama&#8217;s girlfriend. Of course, such a thing would happen. It is also natural that any woman wants to have sex with him. After all, he is Junichi-sama.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when I heard such a story directly from Junichi-sama&#8217;s mouth, something black and dusky instantly swirled in the depths of my heart. Jealousy and hatred. When I realised, there was no sign of anyone outside the door. Junichi-sama and the others seemed to have already gone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ninagawa&#8230;..sorry, but could you go first?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure, see you after school. I&#8217;ll be waiting for you in the clubroom.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I waited until Ninagawa had gone, then I took out my phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, Aneki? I&#8217;m sorry, but can&#8217;t you just kidnap her?　No, no, no! It’s not a matter of money. Eeh? Have you made the arrangements yet? Then change the target. Can you do it?　Yes, the woman you said was in the way. That’s right&#8230;&#8230;Misuzu Kurosawa.”</span></p>

<p><strong>1.2 - No Count for Cheating</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Misuzu&#8217;s stupid!  Idiot! Fat slob!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m not a fat slob, but&#8230;..&#8217;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as it was lunchtime, I called Mai into the corridor and told her everything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The junior members of the football club had tried to attack Fumio and that they had been told not to say anything about it. They tried to somehow get Fumio to leave through the back door to avoid being attacked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..Sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I lower my head, Mai raises her arms in a pout.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just because you&#8217;ve been told not to tell it doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t play rock-paper-scissors with him! Misuzu!　You&#8217;re stupid! Your mum&#8217;s also a fat slob!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My mum&#8217;s not a fat slob either, but…”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But isn&#8217;t your swear word vocabulary a bit strange?Mai…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That football team manager is probably the girl who confessed to Fuーmin and was rejected!　She told the police about what happened before and Fuーmin was questioned about it. She&#8217;s really annoying!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Confess? To that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not strange, you know! Fu-Min is cool!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No, well, if that&#8217;s what&#8230;&#8230;Mai thinks, then that&#8217;s fine.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But she says she&#8217;s having trouble with him following her on social networking sites&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think that&#8217;s true!I&#8217;d rather have Fu–min be that proactive!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;&#8230; I think I can understand that somehow.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It seems like something of a hassle, doesn&#8217;t it, Fumio?&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Mai suddenly folded her arms and made a thoughtful gesture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, is that girl really missing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because, you know, today is the second day since she disappeared, right? Sensei hasn&#8217;t said anything and if there were new missing persons, the news would be making a lot more noise”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘When you say it like that,that may be true.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll just ask her…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ask her..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, with Mai tilting her head to the side, take out my phone and call detective Terashima.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It connects immediately, and the first voice on the speaker is.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s going on? Misuzu-sama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that Terashima-san calls me [Misuzu-sama] must mean that there is no one else around her at the moment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After briefly explaining the circumstances, withholding the names of the junior members of the football club and Fumio, Terashima-san said in a somewhat angry voice.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think there is any problem in saying this because it is not investigative information but there was indeed an inquiry from the school about Rin Fukuda.However, we have not been asked to search for her and above all, we have been informed that she will be away for the rest of the week due to family circumstances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Would it be possible to get in touch with the girl?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have her cell phone number, but no matter how many times I call, I can&#8217;t get through. It&#8217;s either turned off or she&#8217;s in an area with no signal&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, I began to see what was going on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m sure the girl is trying to trick Fumio to make up for being dumped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know whether the junior members of the football club had Fumio in mind for the attack, but if the students suspected him of being the kidnapper, it would make it difficult for him to come to school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If he had told the police in advance to avoid a criminal case then he must have been a very cunning and clever boy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I hung up the phone and told Mai what Terashima-san had told me and my theory, all her usual expressions disappeared from her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had never seen Mai&#8217;s face like that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was scared. I was scared to death. She was too angry to express it with her expression. It was like that.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I involuntarily backed away, Mai tilted her head slightly with an expressionless face and said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misuzu, I have a favour to ask you&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mai then left her afternoon class early.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sixth period is over and I walk up to Fumio, who is getting ready to go home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumio, I&#8217;m going home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;A? Eh? O,okay..see you later.”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he suddenly called out to me, I stuck my finger to the tip of his nose, who was still confused and surprised.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you an idiot? I&#8217;m coming home with you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fua!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumio&#8217;s exaggeratedly turned-up head causes a commotion in the classroom, which is already sparsely populated with students.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, of course it’s a normal reaction. A super beautiful magazine modal like me would never normally ask a dull creepy guy like him to go home with me. If it wasn&#8217;t for Mai&#8217;s request, I would never do it. I would want him to cry and thank me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, instead of being pleased, Fumio was looking around with a pale face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, is that&#8230;&#8230;what of Kasuya-kun?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jun-kun went to club activities.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Fumio lets out a loud exhale,[Hou&#8230;..]</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I mean, how scared are you, pathetic.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, but, Kurosawa-san, why did you suddenly&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“AaaーMouu! Just hurry up and come here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wa,wait! Kurosawa-san!</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s really frustrating. When I grabbed Fumio&#8217;s hand, there were screams all around. Where is the need to make such a fuss over something as simple as holding hands? It&#8217;s too much of an exaggeration. Are they junior high school students?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forcefully pulls Fumio&#8217;s hand and steps out into the corridor, taking large strides towards the shoe locker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, wait a minute, Kurosawa-san”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be quiet!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People I passed in the corridor looked surprised from one side to the other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, seeing a beautiful girl like me (omitted). Anyways! It&#8217;s natural that we don&#8217;t match up but I&#8217;m angry at the people who look surprised and I&#8217;m angry at Fumio who doesn&#8217;t seem to be annoyed at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In particular, the school nurse, Kitora-sensei, said, [Oioi, Kurosawa, if you&#8217;re going to bully him, call him out to the back of the gym instead of taking him directly.] The comments were terrible, and the lack of motivation to do anything about it was so bad that it pushed me over the edge and when I replied, [I&#8217;m just going home with him] her reply was even worse [What are you up to?]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was also annoying that Fumio looked relieved when we came to the shoe locker and let go of his hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so annoyed that, after changing my shoes, I clung to his arm again and as hard as I could.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ku, ku, ku, Kurosawa-san?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s the rush, it&#8217;s not like you&#8217;ve never crossed arms with a girl before. Mai, you hang on to her all the time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fujiwara-san’s things doesn&#8217;t touched me&#8230;..you know, her breasts”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t realise until he told me. Between my breasts, his two arms are sandwiched between them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, my cheeks were hot. No, I&#8217;m seriously embarrassed. But it would be even more aggravating to get flustered here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I will not tell Mai about what you just said. You should be grateful.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, um, yes, ah, thank you.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went straight out the front door and tugged on Fumio&#8217;s arm as he tried to head towards the main gate.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ll exit through the back gate because I still need to keep an eye out for the media”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, but the police are&#8230;&#8230; on the back gate”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They&#8217;ve already checked the road”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I called Terashima-san again earlier to ask for a favour. And when I asked her about it, she told me that the police had already finished investigating the forest road behind the building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I,is that so&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The back gate is usually locked, but now it is also left open, perhaps because of the police traffic.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now with our arms linked, we walked down the dirt road that was surrounded by trees with branches reaching to the sky.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A quiet forest road. Apart from the occasional chirping of birds, all we could hear was our own footsteps. For some reason, it felt very strange that we hardly felt uncomfortable with our arms crossed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When we get to your house, I&#8217;ll wait in your room to be picked up”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re coming to my house?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Fumio looked surprised, I decided to tell him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You said you tripped, but your injuries were the result of an attack, correct? It was the work of a soccer club member. But they wouldn&#8217;t be able to touch you if their senpai&#8217;s girlfriend was with you, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumio instantly widened his eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s with that face!?”</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8230;&#8230;protecting me, you mean &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stupid, Mai asked me to do it. I don&#8217;t like it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I see&#8230;.. Fujiwara-san&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, Fumio, who suddenly looked relieved, I became annoyed again.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Mai would be at ease but now I am insecure!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But why am I so frustrated&#8230;..?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway, I&#8217;m going to go to your place and wait for the detective to come and pick me up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Detective?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The detective who took me into custody, her name is Terashima-san. The media is surrounding my house and I can&#8217;t go home, so until this morning I was staying at Mai&#8217;s place but from today I&#8217;m going to be staying at Terashima-san&#8217;s place!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only reason why I ran away from Terashima-san&#8217;s house is because of Kyoko-san. But now she seems to have already gone back to her university dormitory, so it&#8217;s safe to go back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And right now, I&#8217;m more afraid of Mai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anyway! You&#8217;re an ultra-super lucky man to be able to go home with this super beautiful model, while linking arms with her. You must be overjoyed, right?」</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, Ah, I am happy&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, you&#8217;re so honest!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, we arrived at Fumio&#8217;s house. It was almost dark but the house was pitch black. Not a single light was on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aree?&#8230;Is mom gone shopping?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘A,aree? Isn&#8217;t this bad? Like being alone in a room with a boy in my class who&#8217;s not my boyfriend&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But until Terashima-san comes to pick me up, I have no choice but to stay here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230;..sorry to disturb you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we went up to the house, there was still no sign of anyone. When Fumio switched on the light in the corridor, he turned around and told me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kurosawa-san, go up to my room first. I&#8217;ll change my clothes and bring you something to drink.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa…yes…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I just came here the other day and I know where Fumio&#8217;s room is. Atashi went up the stairs, entered his room and switched on the light.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As usual, it&#8217;s surprisingly tidy. this room&#8230;..doesn&#8217;t feel like anyone living in it or whatever.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked around the room and my eyes fell on a dustbin. When I gently peek into it, it’s empty as I suspected.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Doesn&#8217;t he ever do this sort of thing by himself?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I thought about it, I came to my senses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What am I thinking!’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s bad, I&#8217;ve been poisoned by Mai to a large extent. As soon as I thought that, Fumio came into the room. He had two glasses of white liquid in his hand.I gulp&#8230;&#8230; involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what&#8217;s that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it&#8217;s Kabosu Juice. Maybe you didn&#8217;t like it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don&#8217;t, &#8230;&#8230; but…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at Fumio and see he is wearing the same sweatshirt he was wearing the other day.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘No&#8230;&#8230;this is a bad’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I close my eyes, I can picture Mai sucking his cock the other day and if I open my eyes, my eyes will be drawn to the unprotected crotch of the sweatshirt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During my captivity, I had learnt the taste of semen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still don&#8217;t know who my abductor is but I can feel the thick, sweltering spray of his cock hitting my throat. The sticky texture of the saliva mixing with the grains on my tongue. I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever forget it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ever since Mai showed me how deliciously she sucked Fumio&#8217;s cock, I&#8217;ve been dying to drink his semen. Until today, I have somehow managed to hold it in.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I thought I was finally able to get it out of my head, but at this time, more than anything else, Kabosu…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then I came up with a genius excuse. An excuse to myself.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yes, that’s right, Fumio is a suspected kidnapper&#8230;&#8230;. I have a memory of sucking the killer&#8217;s cock when I was locked up&#8230;&#8230;I mean! If I suck it, I might be able to tell if Fumio is the kidnapper!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I said, I’m  a genius. Yeah, this will have to do.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately walked up to Fumio, who sat down on the bed and whispered in his ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, I had heard you were going to be attacked yesterday. So I tried to send you home through the back gate&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230;..that&#8217;s why you want to play rock-paper-scissors…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I should have told you, but I was told not to&#8230;&#8230;. Sorry”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not Kurosawa-san&#8217;s fault&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I knelt down directly at Fumio&#8217;s feet. Then I looked up at him with a feverish expression on my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As an apology, I can give a blowjob&#8230;..if you want”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“E-eh? Ehhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moou, that&#8217;s too loud. Don&#8217;t get me wrong. It&#8217;s an apology. It&#8217;s an apology! Don&#8217;t take it the wrong way. If I do it, it&#8217;s cheating, but if it&#8217;s just using my mouth, it&#8217;s safe. What? You don&#8217;t like it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeh? No,it’s not that I don&#8217;t like it&#8230;&#8230;but..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, good to know you’re being honest.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my fingers on the elastic of Fumio&#8217;s sweatshirt and slid down his trousers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wa,wait a minute!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumio panics and his cock comes out in a roll.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cock that bounced in front of me was so powerful that I gasped at the size of it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aa,aree? I don&#8217;t remember it being this big.　It&#8217;s amazing, it&#8217;s totally different from Jun-kun&#8217;s&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gently took it in my hand while my fingertips were shaking. The moment I did, Fumio’s cock jumped.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s like some other creature.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With this in mind, I slide my fingers down the rod. As I began to gently squeeze it from the base to the frenulum, it gradually grew harder in my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How does it feel?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,yea..it’s feels good..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His pleasant expression makes me feel a tingle deep in my chest.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.Aree? Fumio is surprisingly cute?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I&#8217;m a beautiful model after all and I&#8217;m pleasuring you, so how can you not feel good?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I proudly puffed my chest, Fumio smiled and whispered in my ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not about whether you&#8217;re a model or not, it&#8217;s because you&#8217;re&#8230;&#8230;Kurosawa-san”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart suddenly begins to beat wildly at his words.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Wait, wait, wait! Why am I so nervous?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re trying to be cheeky, huh,Fumio! Okay, then I&#8217;m going to make you feel even better!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cock in my hand was already very hard and tense. It&#8217;s big and very strong.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I started to crawl my tongue over the tip of the glans.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh, this is it, this is it! This disgusting taste, this texture!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The taste of the meat on my tongue made my heart flutter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn, rerorero, pero, rerorerorero……”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I extended my tongue and started licking around the entire glans. I also rubbed it up and down and poked the bell mouth with the tip of my tongue.. It&#8217;s fun to see Fumio wriggle and squirm every time I do it. It made me happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa, haa&#8230;&#8230;Kurosawa-san is licking me, I’m getting so excited.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumio stroked my hair with his fingertips and whispered to me as he groaned. The thought of this man being aroused by me fills me with a sense of joy akin to superiority.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then I&#8217;ll make you feel better, much, much better.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sucked the cock into my mouth.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aaah, it&#8217;s so big&#8230;&#8230;.’</span></i></p>
<p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/p031-698x1024.jpg" alt="" width="698" height="1024" /></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I know I shouldn&#8217;t compare them, the feeling of Jun-kun&#8217;s cock in my mouth is going through my mind. The feeling of pressure is different. The sense of presence is too different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I started licking and sucking the glans as I rolled it around in my mouth, then swallowed it deeper and deeper.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I couldn&#8217;t possibly swallow it all the way to the root. When I looked up at him, Fumio&#8217;s eyebrows were raised in pleasure.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘As expected, it&#8217;s very big&#8230;&#8230;I can&#8217;t believe it got this deep&#8230;&#8230;still, I can&#8217;t do it like Mai did&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After thinking so, I began to suck on it, shaking my head up and down while handling the rod with my fingers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn, Nfu…Nnn,Jyuuru Nnnn…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I sucked as hard as I could while tightening the rod with my lips, Fumio squirmed violently, [Kuh&#8230;&#8230;.this is amazing].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa..Haa..I-it&#8217;s amazing, Kurosawa-san”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fufunn, isn&#8217;t it? My technique makes you melt, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I am not happy to be praised for this as it should be, but I felt a warm feeling deep in my chest. I want to make Fumio feel even better, that is what I felt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I&#8217;ll make it more pleasurable for you. Nnn, Nfu! Nmu, Njuru, Chu, Nnn!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I am still in a buoyant mood, I deliver a thicker blowjob. As I shook my head quickly while increasing the suction, Fumio gasped for air miserably.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nngh, Kurosawa-san, too intense&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nfuh, Njuru! Cyuparero! Jururu, Jurururu!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Amazing,I’m making such naughty sounds&#8230;..so great…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite feeling shame at the obscene sounds I am making, I cannot stop the momentum of my blowjob. I can&#8217;t stop wanting to make Fumio feel even better.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to cum, Kurosawa-san!I&#8217;m already melting!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He seemed to be soaking in the pleasure of the sucking as he leaned back and relaxed his body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m getting more aroused. My body is hot and the pit of my stomach is tingling. Even though I&#8217;m only sucking which feels good. I think it&#8217;s a little bit immodest, but I&#8217;ve already become addicted to this pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I continued to handle Fumio’s cockwith my lips, I heard an urgent voice from above me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t do this anymore! I&#8217;m going to cum, Kurosawa-san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let it out, you can let it out anytime”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the speed of the rubbing was increased all at once, the cock, which had swelled greatly for a moment, suddenly exploded in my mouth.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Byuru! Burururu! Bururu!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn! Nnn, Nn..!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumio let out so much that I feel like I&#8217;m drowning. The gooey liquid overflows into my mouth and I involuntarily swells my cheeks like a squirrel.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I-it&#8217;s great, oh, it&#8217;s good, thick and rich&#8230; It&#8217;s also very fishy and stuffy’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The smell of a man&#8217;s foul odour in my nose almost makes me lose consciousness. I swallow it desperately, trying to hold on to the consciousness that is about to faint.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“nku, nku, nku, nkhh”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s slimy, sticky and gets stuck in the back of my throat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it&#8217;s delicious. Very, very tasty. I can&#8217;t stand it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I finish swallowing everything, I suck out what&#8217;s left in his penis. I don&#8217;t want to waste even a drop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slurrpppppp! I sucked it up, making a noise, and it made him scratch his head in the air, saying, [Kuhhh&#8230;..]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sucked up his cock until it was completely clean looking slippery and sloppy and then I released it from my mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Puhaaa!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I had to describe it in one word, it would be very satisfying. It was the best. If this was a first-class restaurant, I would have called the chef.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;know if he is a kidnapper or not. Well, that can&#8217;t be helped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But now I had another problem that was very bad. This is really bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My body was on fire and I wanted to have sex so badly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, no, no. I&#8217;m in a fierce struggle between myself, who is accusing me of cheating from this point on and myself, who is insisting that it would definitely feel good to insert that dick into me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found myself snuggled up next to Fumio, rubbing my cheek against his shoulder as if to pamper him. I think my eyes are debauched.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This, this could be bad. I&#8217;m going to be flushed&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment I thought that, my phone made a rattling sound and I jumped up involuntarily. Terashima-san&#8217;s name was displayed on the screen of the phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah! Terashima-san&#8217;s here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I say this out loud, I suddenly become calm, and instantly a tremendous sense of embarrassment washes over me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, then, I&#8217;m leaving!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly jumped off the bed, grabbed my bag and ran down the stairs.</span></p>

<p><strong>1.3 - Girls' Track and Field Club Confinement Day 7──who?</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa..Haa..Haa..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I &#8211; Saori Moribe &#8211; wiped the sweat from my forehead with the back of my hand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind me is the figure of Shima-senpai, sitting in turtle shell bondage. When I steal a glance at her while regulating my breathing, she is looking downcast with an apologetic expression on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dimly lit breeding ground where no sunlight reaches. Although there is no change from day to night in this place, according to my perception of time, ten to eleven hours had already passed since Shima-senpai fell and became like pigs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have not been able to have lunch and I keep checking on the pigs who are trying to mess with Shima-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takasago-senpai had finished beating the pigs appropriately in the morning and left the breeding ground, while Yui had beaten Adachi-senpai and Saito-san 40 times each and once I thought she had left this place, she returned to the breeding ground again, probably to digest the remaining 20 times just now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably in another hour or so, it will be time for our dinner. Once that was over, it would be time for the evening feeding.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once that time arrives, I will no longer be able to shelter and protect Shima-senpai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai has remained silent for a long time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is probably anxious. She is probably also worried about Captain Tashiro. The reason she doesn&#8217;t answer my questions is that if I talk to her in the way I had until this morning, she might inadvertently make me fall in love with a pig. Maybe she is thinking that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Moribe, you&#8217;ve already beaten me more than a hundred times, haven&#8217;t you? Go home already!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saori can&#8217;t help it, she wants to abuse us, that&#8217;s why she&#8217;s been staying here all this time, it&#8217;s terrible, don&#8217;t you think?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hotta-san and Marko provoke me from afar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai have proved that the interchange between the pigs and the interrogators exists.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to this, the frightened look on the girls&#8217; faces has disappeared and they start pressuring me excessively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided not to open my mouth at all and just glared at them. And just as I was about to whip the floor to intimidate them, a nasal breath rubbed my earlobe.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yui&#8217;s voice?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my eyes to the area where she had just been and gulped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hah&#8230;..mm, good, good, Amemiya. There, there it is&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was Yui, who was rolling up her short skirt. Between her legs was the figure of Amemiya-senpai, who was on all fours with her head stuck in a crawling position.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui has her underwear off and has her exposed crotch licked by Amemiya-senpai.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hot breaths echoed in the dimly lit menagerie. From a distance, Amemiya-senpai&#8217;s red tongue could be seen wriggling and squirming.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa, haa&#8230;&#8230;ahhh, nnnn&#8230;&#8230;how is it? Amemiya, is it good?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mmmm, Gyuu, puhhhhaaa&#8230;.. Yui-sama, it&#8217;s delicious!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ufufu….good sweetie. Now, please make me feel even better.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,yes..rero,rero”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was standing there, stunned, I came to my senses and shouted out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nah! Hey! What are you doing! Yui!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, with an ecstatic expression, she tilted her head and gave me a debauched look.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was getting hot from all the wiping, so I let Amemiya calm me down.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Calm down?..d-d-doing it with a girl, that kind of thing&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not between girls. The girl is a pig. She is not a human being.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I am speechless, Yui starts to let out more and more excited voices.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa,Haa….Ahahann,tha–that’s better. Use your tongue to suck on it more, yes,like that, Aaa,Aa&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jyu, zuzu, rero rero, Yui-sama,Yui-sama”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaa…Erotic..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such voices were heard from the surrounding pigs. However, Yui didn&#8217;t seem to care and kept rising higher and higher on Amemiya-senpai&#8217;s tongue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ufufu, I never thought the day would come when I would be forced to serve Amemiya like this&#8230;&#8230;. Ah, Aaan, it&#8217;s all thanks to the King of Confinement, Aa, Aa,Aaaa&#8230;&#8230;my dear my lord, the great King of Confinement, what kind of person are you, Aa, Aa,Aaaa I want to see you, I want to see you. I wonder if you&#8217;re still watching me somewhere&#8230;&#8230;An, please make Yui, please make Yui yours, Confinement King!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui muttered in a raspy voice. She once said she really wants to serve the Confinement King.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t want to be released.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She also said that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps this is a way of making her presence known, thinking that the Confinement King must be watching from somewhere.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘And then there&#8217;s this&#8230;..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I look at her, I start to feel embarrassed and I involuntarily turn away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh, Amemiya ah, nnnn, ah, ki, feel good, ah, ah, ah, ah, aaaah, ah..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yui&#8217;s tone of voice gradually turned urgent, and I heard the pigs watching around me gulp and slurp something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, Yui tightly knitted her eyebrows and bit her lip. Her body stiffened as she clamped Amemiya-senpai&#8217;s head between her thighs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m cumming!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And with a high-pitched voice, her body began to convulse.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kyaaa!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Yui squirts from her crotch noisily, soaking Amemiya-senpai&#8217;s face. She then grabbed Amemiya-senpai&#8217;s head with a face soaked in pleasure that her knees trembled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From outside the window, the sound of Ryoko&#8217;s car with Kurosawa-san in it was heard moving away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was surprised, but&#8230;..somehow, it was amazing&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The feel of Kurosawa-san&#8217;s lips. A feeling I hadn&#8217;t had in a long time. While soaking up the afterglow, I let the 『door』 appear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not the weak and pretty Misuzu when she was locked up but the strong-willed Kurosawa-san. When I think that she sucked my cock on her own, I feel unspeakable emotions welling up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still don&#8217;t quite understand how it happened, but maybe Kurosawa-san is starting to like me?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, the day when I can have her back in my hands again may not be far off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I even think that at the end, if Ryoko hadn&#8217;t called her at that point in time, I think we would have crossed the line once again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now, Ryoko will be punished.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I passed through the door while muttering that&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ehh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tilted my head involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because suddenly, a level-up electronic sound that I didn&#8217;t remember rang out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「The status of Yui Kayama has been changed to 『Submissive』 . Accordingly, the following functions are available.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Room creation level 7: You can use up to 24 rooms at the same time.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Furniture installation level 6: You can install quite luxurious furniture in your rooms.」</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Special equipment (staircase): &#8211; Staircases can be installed in corridors.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">「Trojan Horse──You can set a trigger and an action for each person who enters the room. Once an action is triggered, the trigger is cancelled.」</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked around suspiciously from side to side and tilted my head involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who is this Yui Kayama&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha&#8230; That&#8217;s Ringlets from the track and field club, Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I summoned Lili to the bedroom of the Confinement King and asked her, she replied with amusement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ringlets….ah, freshman”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could also vaguely remember the ringlet hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was told by Lili to choose 『four girls of your choice』 and I chose her to be one of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is quite a problem when I was asked to choose four people without warning and the only person among the 18 track and field club members that I recognize in every way is a girl I had a crush on in the same class when I was in first year. That was the only one. The remaining three are therefore almost a process of elimination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Short-cut girls were out of the question, as they included the four girls who were photographed by Fujiwara. I chose the remaining three by looking at the mugshots Lili had prepared for me, and one of them was indeed a cute girl with Ringlets.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But&#8230;..how? I haven&#8217;t done anything to her, have I?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, I don&#8217;t even know her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ringlets is a sadistic person, dissatisfied with her current situation and class-conscious, so I put her in the role of jokers in the group training. Then, without me having to do anything, she started worshipping the Confinement King on her own Devi.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I,is that so?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think she&#8217;s a little bit of an assumptive girl, falling into [Submissive] to someone she&#8217;s never met&#8230;.That&#8217;s a little scary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, then&#8230;&#8230;is that the girl you said you were going to bring to my place tonight?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked this fearfully, Lili shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8217;No, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili continued to talk while I patted my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ringlets will be happy to be embraced if you call her out, Devi, but the group training will be finished tomorrow. I believe Ringlets can wait until after the group training is finished.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Which girl then?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s obvious Devi. FumiFumi really wants to get her right? That&#8217;s what you said, that girl Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Really?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I look at her unintentionally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m serious Devi. The preparation has been set up. She&#8217;s already in a pinned-down position&#8230;&#8230;And Fumi Fumi as the Confinement King, you&#8217;re going to have to play a very difficult role in stripping her mask, Devi. So, for the next three hours, you&#8217;re going to train hard, Devi!”</span></p>
