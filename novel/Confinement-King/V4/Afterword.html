<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Afterword </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you very much for purchasing Confinement King 4.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As always, I am Masai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The year 2022 was a truly significant year for author Masai. The  Confinement King was able to add to its volume count, and a new series, The Legend of Me, was also launched. I am relieved that the second volume of the comic book series, which started in February, seems to be well received. The fact that I suffered from corona is, well, charming. The fact that my niece, a junior high school student, found out about my Twitter account was more traumatic.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the beginning of the year, I set a (for me, quite high) target of publishing ten books a year, and including comicalisations and e-books, this 『Confinement King Vol 4』 is the ninth book. There are also some works in progress, so it looks like I&#8217;m on track to achieve my goal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to work even harder next year to meet the expectations of my readers, and although I am sorry to talk about other companies, I think I will be able to report to you about the new work I have been working on behind the scenes since 2021 at the beginning of the next year, 2023.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is thanks to this work, 『The Confinement King』, that I have been able to receive so many jobs like this. It is thanks to everyone who has supported this work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you very much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sincerely hope that, if possible, I can continue to develop this work with care in future volumes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, this fourth volume contains the second half of the second chapter of the web version up to part of the interval. As for the content, the hate that has been accumulated since the first volume is collected with a raging wave. It is a refreshing volume. The story progresses, so there is a lot of shifting of viewpoints, but I&#8217;m very happy if you enjoy it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(The next volume will be the start of the third chapter, assuming I can continue the story), and I am still considering whether I will follow the web version or develop it in an original way, but if I follow the web version, that『salmon』 that readers have been waiting for might appear on the cover.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would now like to move on to the acknowledgements.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to thank everyone at 123 Shobo, including S-sama, who was in charge of the book.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to Pei-sensei, who always creates the best illustrations. I would also like to thank everyone at KADOKAWA who has been involved in the comic book version, and Asimoto Yoshioka-sensei, who has done a wonderful job on the comic book version. Thank you very much.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To my family and friends who pretend not to see me, to everyone who has read volumes 1, 2 and 3 also to everyone who has read the web version, and to everyone who has given me feedback and encouragement there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And finally, I would like to thank you from the bottom of my heart for purchasing this Confinement King  4.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thank you so much.</span></p>
