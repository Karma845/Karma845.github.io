<h3>Chapter 5: When Fumio Kijima Came into the Limelight</h3>

<p><strong>5.1 - Day Nine of the Track and Field Team Members&#8217; Confinement &#8211; Escape Was Until They Got Home</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;&#8230; haa&#8230;&#8230; haa&#8230;&#8230; haa&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;.haa&#8230;.haa&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san and I were lying on the bed, completely naked, breathing heavily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whenever she fainted, I would force her to restart by pouring in just a little bit of magical nutritional drink into her mouth. I kept holding her until morning, totally ignoring her words of [I&#8217;m sorry].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bed was truly in awful condition. It was so soggy with bodily fluids from both of us that I thought we had poured it using a bucket.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a good thing that I could do something about it with『Furniture Installation』but normally it was in such a spectacular state that I&#8217;d have to replace the whole bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sight of Kurosawa-san lying in such a situation was also quite spectacular.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her legs were in a gangly position. Her vaginal opening was wide open and could not be closed, and a thick white liquid was constantly flowing down sloppily. It was not just the private parts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Misuzu&#8217;s whole body was covered in semen from being sprayed so many times. Her white skin was covered with threads of cum. Her pink nipples were coated in white fluid, and when she shuddered, semen dripped down the curves of her breasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such a sight of her gave me an inexpressible sense of accomplishment and a pent-up love for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I truly love you, Kurosawa-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I too..love you…Haa…haa…haa…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at the moment when Kurosawa-san gave a debauched smile, the door suddenly slammed open and some people stepped into the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I lazily moved my head only and looked in that direction, I saw Masaki and Tashiro-san there.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan&#8217;s eyebrows twitched at the rough and tumble of the room, and she put the loudspeaker she was holding to her mouth, though I did not know where she had taken it from.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyi────n </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">High-pitched sound. Then she raised her voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Weー!! Demandー!!  Fumio-kunー!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We demand him!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro belatedly chanted with her hands raised in the air, and the noise caused Kurosawa, who should have been limping, to jump up in a hurry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Noisy! W-w-w-what? What happened?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While looking at Kurosawa-san and me, Masaki-chan took a deep breath and raised her voice again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Treat the favoured princesses equally!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Equal treatment!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Specifically, tonight I demand sex for me and tomorrow I demand sex for Hatsu-chan that is equal to or greater than what Fumio-kun gave to Misuzu today!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tonight&#8230;&#8230; w-wait a minute, Masaki-dono! Why are you the first to go? I can&#8217;t hold out until tomorrow!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m first and Hatsu-chan is second. Isn&#8217;t that natural?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is natural! I heard that the first and second are just an order, not a hierarchy!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Why the two of them argue over that&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about it, but of course I couldn&#8217;t say it.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought this was Lili’s work, as they were apparently peering into this room from somewhere. And it wasn&#8217;t hard to imagine that Masaki-chan would have had a rivalry with Misuzu, not wanting to lose to her.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s getting tricky&#8230;&#8230;.But wait. On the contrary, if I hold Misuzu and Masaki-chan together, it will be very erotic, right?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Imagining such sex scene was quite fun&#8230;..moreover with their rivalry. But I&#8217;d put it aside for tonight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged my shoulders and told them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Masaki-chan, Tashiro-san, don&#8217;t you remember you&#8217;re leaving here tonight to go home?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, they both let out a dumb [ah]. Only Kurosawa-san, who didn&#8217;t understand the situation, had a puzzled look on her face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Later today, we were going together and discussing the plan.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were going to finalise the plan for the girls&#8217; return, excluding the four in question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone in the athletics club, including Tashiro-san, Masaki, Kurosawa-san and the women I rescued from being trafficked yesterday. I was going to put it all together and release them today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shima-senpai, why did you decide to stay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s obvious. It&#8217;s because I&#8217;m worried about Hatsu-chan. Hatsu-chan is an airhead that can&#8217;t read the atmosphere, thus, I have to follow her&#8230;&#8230;. Besides, if I can go back and forth, I don&#8217;t think you need to take it so seriously&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the dinner, we were given a pair of rooms for three or four people to spend the night.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the same room as me were Shima-senpai and Amemiya-senpai. Feeling a bit like a school trip, we talked until midnight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about Amemiya-senpai?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I &#8230;&#8230; that, I might have fallen in love and&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, I stopped listening to her already.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saori, you must know! There are a lot of things in this world that it&#8217;s better to not  know!”</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next morning, the silver-haired maid announced it to all of us during breakfast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone is scheduled to return around 17:00 this evening. Until then, you are welcome to relax in your rooms, or use the swimming pool or bathroom as you please. Also, there will always be tea and snacks available in the dining room.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was very sleepy last night because I stayed up too late. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finished breakfast and went back to my room for another sleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it was nearly noon and I got up lazily, I went to the dining room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the dining room, Takasago-senpai was naturally there.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a variety of cakes lined up on the table and was happily chewing on them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the table in the back was Yui, who was soaking up the pleasure of boasting. And then there was the figure of Amemiya-senpai, who was looking at Yui with a passionate eye, and lifting her up like a taiko drummer. [As expected of Yui-sama].</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yeah, I&#8217;ll never go near that place.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The ones who were carrying tea and cakes were Mako and Saito-san, who had become apprentice servants.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I spoke to Mako while she was serving me tea, she responded in a very formal way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The head maid has strictly instructed us to serve you as servants.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it possible for you guys to stop? It feels weird.”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after saying so, Mako stubbornly refused to change her attitude. I had no choice but to continue talking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her if she had eaten properly yesterday, she told me that she was fed the same food after we had finished our meal and returned to our room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said that the silver-haired maid was strict in her disapproval of their work, and the punishment for failure was not uncommon, but she was not beaten up for no reason and she was fed properly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was a relief, to be honest. I had been worried that she was being abused.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I returned to my room after enjoying the tea, I found that Shima-senpai had returned to her room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her about it, she told me that she was a servant and she was allowed to enter the room given to the Captain by the Confinement King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was a room like a hotel in Dubai. Somehow close to that&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought she probably meant to say it was luxurious.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the evening, when the uniforms and bags I was wearing when I was locked up here were returned, I gradually felt that I could go home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, everyone, please gather in the corridor, starting with those who have already changed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following the lead of the silver-haired maid, we formed a line in the corridor and were led straight to a room at the back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door had been a dead end until yesterday, but now there was a new door.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yeah&#8230;..well, I&#8217;m not really surprised anymore.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stepped into the room with Shima-senpai in the lead, it was a rather spacious but bleak stone room with no furniture. At the back of the room, a rather massive wooden door could be seen.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Is that the exit&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, please wait here for a while longer.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the silver-haired maid announced this and left the room, no one spoke up. Everyone glanced around with a somewhat wary look on their faces.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was probably natural. We had had a pretty bad time so far. With a few exceptions, relationships had been destroyed, and even if we made it back in one piece, it was a headache to think about what would happen later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Captain Tashiro and 13 of us, excluding the four who remain here as maids, had been waiting there for some time, five women came in, led by a silver-haired maid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were of different ages and dressed differently. At least I didn’t remember meeting them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;..who are those people?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Shima-senpai asked, the silver-haired maid replied.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“These are the people the Confinement King rescued from the traffickers last night. We will now return  these people alongside you all.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Rescued from the traffickers? What is that?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We could only be puzzled. Wasn&#8217;t the King of Confinement a bad person?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We waited another five minutes or so. This time, three people entered the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl in the same uniform as us. I could recognise Masaki-sama, Captain Tashiro but not her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I could hear whispered conversation leaking out from the club members behind me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, isn&#8217;t that MISUZU, the reader modal?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve heard of her! She’s in our third year, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why is she here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, she was a famous person. I was somehow unfamiliar with fashion. Most of the time, I wore clothes that my mother bought for me. So, even if she said she was a model, it didn&#8217;t ring a bell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The first favourite princess, Masaki Haneda, the second favourite princess, Hatsu Tashiro, and the third favourite princess, Misuzu Kurosawa, are here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid raised her voice. However, the three of them were not concerned about that, and continued to talk, tension-free.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As I thought, I&#8217;m not really satisfied with the third position. Masaki, can you switch with me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I don&#8217;t want to. But, if you want, I&#8217;ll be the first, Misuzu-chan the second, and Hatsu-chan the third.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t make someone the third without permission. That&#8217;s just the way it is, First Favourite.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t want to be told only by Hatsu-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The silver-haired maid coughed out a [kohon] as if to restrain the three of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now then, I would like to invite you all to leave. The exit is through the door at the back. The door will close in 30 seconds after the first person has left, so please exit quickly. Please exit in the order in which you came to this room.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then looked round at everyone and continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please be advised that after you leave this place, all of your memories, with the exception of the semi-favourite princesses, apprentices and their servants, will have their memories here sealed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she folded her waist deeply.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now it is time for you to go. Good day to you all. The first person to arrive in this room will be the first to leave the door. You have only 30 seconds.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I was the first, right&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was right. Shima-senpai was the first, and I was the next. Shima-senpai put her hand on the door knob and looked back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let&#8217;s go!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai jumped through the door and I hurriedly followed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side of the door was a small room that looked like the reception room of some small business.  I couldn&#8217;t stay there as they came out one after the other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai jumped over the sofa in the reception room, and following her, I traversed the room and reached the door on the other side of it. But when I got there&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell is that!! What the hell are you thinking, bastard!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An angry voice echoed from the other side of the door, and Shima-senpai and I involuntarily looked at each other.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh no! Something is going bad!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time we thought that, it was too late.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, don&#8217;t push me, Moribe!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if you said that to me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were pushed out of the way by the club members who came running out after us, and we fell against the door as if we were pushing it down.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Batan! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">The door opened with a rattling noise and we rolled into the next room on a chessboard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouch&#8230;..!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heav,Heavy!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai and I were trapped underneath and the next moment we looked up, we went rigid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an office-like place with a row of desks. A group of men with boisterous, yakuza-like looks surrounded a boy who was poised in the middle of it from a distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere was swarthy. It looked like a fighting scene no matter how you looked at it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: 修羅場: Shuraba;fighting scene]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The scary-looking men looked startled for a moment, then shouted at us for suddenly barging in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W,who the hell are you people! Where the hell do you come from?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hii!? It&#8217;s not like that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-senpai&#8217;s face tensed up and she shook her head vigorously. It was scary. It was too scary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that wasn&#8217;t the point. I was completely frozen. My mind couldn&#8217;t process what was happening in front of me. I was in a state of processing my brain, as in the world of retro games.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Onii-chan! W-why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy who was surrounded by people who looked like yakuza, that was my neighbour&#8217;s elder brother, whom I had been in love with ever since primary school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was because he was Fumio Onii-chan.</span></p>

<p><strong>5.2 - Fumio Dynamites!</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Time went back a little further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today I stepped into an entertainment district for the first time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the entertainment district was in a provincial city so it was not that big of a place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were a lot of bars catering to old men and there were many empty shops with their shutters still closed. There were no fashionable clubs either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the middle of such a shabby bar district, there was a line of pencil buildings with flashy signs of snacks and bars. On the first floor of an old building behind it, there was a commercial space without any signboards.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:skinny skyscraper]</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shutters on the front of the building remained tightly closed. There were traces of a sign, but nothing was currently displayed, and the windows were covered with mirror stickers, so there was no view of what was inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only thing that stood out was the bad character of the people who came in and out of the building, which was a so-called clan office. It was the branch office of the Kamishima clan, under the leadership of the clan leader&#8217;s only son, Ryuichi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned to the back of the building with an unsuspecting look on my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Admittedly, I didn’t know what it looked like inside, but I already had the structure of the interior in my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili disappeared last night and scouted the interior for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to the floor plan she drew for me, I had a good idea of where everything was in the building.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stepped into the alleyway at the back of the building and used 『Passthrough』 to the reception room at the back of the office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was not trying to do anything. My purpose at this point was to break in, that was all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once I had visited this place, I could always open the door here with 『Revisit』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I had served my purpose, I used the 『Passthrough』to get out.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This should be all primed and ready to go &#8230;&#8230;. Shouldn&#8217;t it?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reminded myself again of this morning&#8217;s meeting to see if I had forgotten anything</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili was floating near the ceiling of the dining room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Surrounding the table were the three favourites: me, Masaki, Tashiro-san and Kurosawa-san. In addition to that, Ryoko, dressed in a pantsuit, was standing right next to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way, I can&#8217;t believe he even touched Terashima-san&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, the  Confinement King is a bad man!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tashiro-san laughed at Kurosawa-san, who looked at me with a frown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, I have always wondered, what is this 『Confinement King』&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“After all this time!?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan looked at Kurosawa-san twice, and Tashiro-san said, [The Confinement King is the Confinement King, of course] and with that the atmosphere became somewhat more agreeable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know if that was good enough, but, well, if that was good enough for Kurosawa-san, then let&#8217;s just go with it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, I didn’t really understand the subtle feelings that girls had regarding this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Masaki. Is the stuff I asked you for yesterday ready?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her that, Masaki-chan proudly stuck out her V-sign.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perfect &#8211; I&#8217;m good at crafts and handicrafts!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;s right. Fumio, have you ever been to Masaki&#8217;s house?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that one time when I was breaking in.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Breaking in&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa made a questioning look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, okay. You must have seen the doorknob cover on the door of Masaki&#8217;s room, didn&#8217;t you? That was Masaki&#8217;s handiwork and all the doorknobs in the house have them. And they are very frilly ones. Sooner or later, all the doors in this place might have door knob covers.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;.. I&#8217;d like to refrain from that ever happening.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, if people were about to be tortured and then taken to a room with a very cute door knob cover on it, they wouldn&#8217;t know what face to make.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Ryoko, did you find out who kidnapped Kurosawa-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;&#8230;but if we investigate based on the characteristics of the kidnapping group that Misuzu-sama told us about earlier, we should be able to identify them in the near future.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, but&#8230;we can&#8217;t wait for that. For now, as planned, I&#8217;m going to have a gangster who seems to be trafficking in people take on the role of the criminal.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaー&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s like a food chain where the bad guys are preyed upon by the Confinement King which is worse than them&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san made a face of disbelief, and Tashiro-san nodded her head. Then, suddenly, Lili changed the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, FumiFumi, one of the six people that Kurosawa-chan and you brought with you yesterday, would like to stay here, Devi. What should we do, Devi? It seems she has nowhere to go, Devi&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; well, I have extra room and I don&#8217;t mind.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, you can meet with her later and decide what to do with her, Devi. If you don&#8217;t like her, you can treat her as an apprentice servant, Devi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apprentice servant&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The four girls who took the naked photos of Fujiwara-san were now apprenticed servants. However, contrary to the soft terminology of servant apprentices, Lili and Freesia had thoroughly trained them in Spartan techniques so that they could be useful to me. I didn’t know what kind of training they were talking about here, but it was, after all, the work of the devil. It must be something extraordinary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, I couldn’t treat an innocent girl like that, and in any case, it was not the time to be distracted by such things today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From there we worked out the details of the plan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though&#8230;&#8230; It was Lili and Ryoko who had made a detailed minute-by-minute plan beforehand, and all I had to do was figure it out and approve it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I moved to the front of the office again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was hot. Even though it was evening in early summer. Despite this, I was wearing jeans, a T-shirt and a long black coat that smelled really bad and looked like a Chuunibyou. No wonder it was so hot.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wiped the sweat from my forehead with my cuff and took my phone out of my pocket to check the time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Two minutes before the raid.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Casually looking around, I saw a figure peering at me from the alleyway.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Probably Ryoko and the others. At five o&#8217;clock today, a gunman would be jumping into the Kamishima clan. I had her report such a tip to her superior.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a separate case that had nothing to do with the kidnapping case under Inspector Nakamura&#8217;s command. Ryoko said that she could bring in the police from her jurisdiction in this form.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered if the police would act on such a fishy story, but apparently she was able to set things up well. I could feel quite a few eyes on me.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I took a deep breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was time to go in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door to the office was locked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The kitchen door by the office  was also locked. But that meant nothing to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Conscious that the police officers were watching me, I manifested a 『Door』 that had been transformed to look exactly like the door there. Then, when I entered the building by 『Passthrough』, I unlocked the original door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, this was for the detectives and police who were supposed to enter later.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a good grasp of the structure of the building. No, it was not so much the structure. The floor map was simple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Right now, in front of me, there was a tsuitate that looked like a Japanese gold folding screen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: Credits to TinyTL:tsuitate is a form of single-panel portable partition traditionally used in Japan since at least the 6th century]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side of it was a row of desks with the atmosphere of an office in a small or medium-sized company. The only difference between this and a normal office was the rarity of the people there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was originally a bookshop, then apparently used as an election office. And it was still nominally an election office, with its contents unchanged.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought it might be a black relationship between politicians and the underworld&#8230;&#8230; but the truth was that the person who was the nominee was unsuccessful in his election campaign and then, they forced a debt-ridden person to run the office in order to get the office. After all, not many landlords were willing to rent space to yakuza.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well&#8230;&#8230;I gotta do it when I gotta do it.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took another deep breath, kicked down the door stand in front of me and shouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Get out of my way!　You idiot!”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, the men sitting at their desks on the other side of the slammed-down desk stood up in a flurry of activity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some were quick to reach for the wooden swords that were propped up. Others hung their hands on the desk drawers. As I expected, none of them suddenly brought out their pistols, but I was met with a terrifying stare.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were fewer of them than I thought. One, two, three &#8230;&#8230;eight in all. But they all looked disgustingly scary.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the most powerful person was the all-black man at the back of the room with his legs propped up on the desk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This guy was probably the boss.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The rest were chairs with all-backs, and a woman standing leaning on the back of one of them. She looked like a cabaret girl, but she, too, had a strong presence.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That’s her!&#8230;&#8230; Anna Kamishima!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was the one who caused Fujiwara-san to suffer horribly.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I stared at the woman with a gut-wrenching sensation, the nearest young man with a punch perm reached for my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where the fuck did you come in!　You little shit!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t touch me with your filthy hands.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grabbed the wrist of his hand that was about to twist up my chest, and the next moment, the punch perm softly floated in the air and slammed into the wall.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shinjii!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!? What did you do!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t do anything though. Torture just threw him away, but to them I was the one who did it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you don&#8217;t want to eat my air throw, give her back to me quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girlfriend here was, in a manner of speaking, an image of 『Rin Fukuda』. Of course, this was just an act.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Later, when I was taken into police custody for questioning, I was almost framed as Rin Fukuda&#8217;s kidnapper, and I was cornered, so I rushed into the anti-corporation office out of the blue &#8211; that was how I explained it to them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Teruya’s sister, after acting as if she was seriously thinking about something, began to shower me with a blunt stare, as if she was judging me. And she twisted her cheeks with some kind of fun. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuuh&#8230; So, because she was kidnapped, you ran into this place.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right! I know it was you who kidnapped her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said this, she laughed gaily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahahahahaha, that&#8217;s nice. I thought there was something strange about Hikari-chan, but you’re quite a nice guy. I mean, it&#8217;s not like you’re a decent guy to come into the office by yourself for her&#8230;. Right, Junichi Kasuya-kun?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.pardon?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There seemed to be some strange misunderstanding going on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anyway! Give her back! Or else!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled a lighter from my pocket and rolled up my coat. Underneath was a large number of red tubes. A red cylinder with a fuse was wrapped around my stomach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going to blow this place to hell with all of you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dy,dynamite?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where do you get dynamite&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You idiots! It&#8217;s a bluff!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The men&#8217;s faces scrunched up, and I bent over my chest to give myself more room to breathe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can’t tell if I&#8217;m bluffing or not if I don’t light it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell is that!! What the hell are you thinking, asshole?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, the shaved head shouted at the top of his lungs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, one of the red tubes broke off in the middle and rolled on the floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The shaved head, who had picked it up, shouted angrily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You bastard! That&#8217;s a toilet paper roll, right?  Don&#8217;t play with me!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hiー! Masaki-chan! It&#8217;s not glued on properly!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gang members all looked as if they were going to hit me at once, and I braced myself on the spur of the moment. In fact, since I was relying on Torture, there was no need for me to brace myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But at the very moment when the shaved-headed gang member was about to grab me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Teruya shouted. And then she leaned down to the man with the all black and whispered to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Ryu-chan.. Don&#8217;t hurt that boy. He&#8217;s Hikari-chan&#8217;s favourite.. He has a lot of guts, so why don&#8217;t you tell him well and we&#8217;ll take care of him in the future?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230;&#8230; well, if it&#8217;s for the sake of my cute sister-in-law, I can tolerate a little mischief.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, Teruya&#8217;s sister still thought I was Kasuya-kun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But thanks to this, the gang members did not attack me, just surrounded me at a distance. I looked at the clock on the wall. The time was exactly five o&#8217;clock in the evening. It seemed that I had somehow managed to buy some time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, don&#8217;t push me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if you said that to me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door at the back of the room opened with a resounding noise, and the girls tumbled in, falling over.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Teruya&#8217;s sister and the all-black guy widened their eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who the hell are you people! Where the hell do you come from?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hii!? It&#8217;s not like that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The man near the door shouted at the girls, and the next moment, the door of the office behind me opened with a loud noise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t move! Police!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In an instant, the air froze and the gang members stopped moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning their backs, they saw Detectives Inomoto and Ryoko. Behind them, a number of police officers, fully equipped, with transparent polycarbonate shields in their hands, stepped in one after another.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Detective Inomoto then raised one eyebrow in a grand gesture when he saw the girls in the back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I stepped in on a tip that there was a yakuza conflict, an unexpectedly big fish was caught in the net. You guys! You&#8217;re all under arrest for kidnapping a minor!”</span></p>

<p><strong>5.3 - The Most Confused Person when Asking Who the hell Are You is Usually the Person Himself</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I left the gang&#8217;s office, a blinding light flooded in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Camera flashes flickered incessantly and a person who appeared to be a reporter shouted, [They&#8217;re coming out! They&#8217;re coming out!] .</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A swell of noise. A crowd of uproar people. Red revolving lights were glowing everywhere, and the sound of several sirens echoed far and near.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With blankets over our heads, the girls and I left the gang office after the handcuffed gang members had been packed into a convoy bus.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we went out front, a considerable number of police cars and ambulances filled the street. And a lot of onlookers and the press were surrounding them in the distance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, they&#8217;ll probably do a full check-up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder if they can tell if I&#8217;m pregnant?　It would be nice if we are having a baby.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Um, no comment. No, I knew it was a serious possibility, but right now, I didn’t know what to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I diverted the conversation for the time being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard that Kurosawa-san took about a week to come to the school after being questioned and examined.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s going to take that long?  ……一I can&#8217;t see Fumio-kun for a week, that&#8217;s bad. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even without looking at her face, I could roughly imagine what Masaki-chan looked like now. Probably a dissatisfied expression with pouty lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thinking about it, this could also be a sign that I had grown closer to her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I wrote the love letter, I could only picture a smile when I tried to picture Masaki-chan&#8217;s face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At about the same time as I was chuckling unintentionally, Detective Inomoto grabbed my hand and pulled me away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You, come here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And just like that, I was pushed into the back seat of the police car.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ryoko was already in the driver&#8217;s seat, and with me in the middle, Detective Inomoto and a young plainclothes policeman got in through the doors on either side.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aren&#8217;t three escorts for just me too exaggerated?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps sensing my confusion, Detective Inomoto made a soured face and told me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are in a different position to the girls. Theirs is protection, but yours is an arrest. You are under arrest for trespassing on private property and assault.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh, I see&#8230;&#8230;’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was not surprising, if you asked me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was not on the side of justice, but if I raided a bad guy&#8217;s hideout and went on a rampage, the ally of justice would be arrested on the same charges as me, according to the law. I was a criminal even though I was on the side of justice. I felt like I understood what Lili meant when she said that good and evil were like the two sides of a reversible coin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kijima, we&#8217;ll have to talk to you in detail at the station first. You won&#8217;t be able to leave easily, so please be prepared for that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, there are extenuating circumstances and I don&#8217;t think you&#8217;ll actually be prosecuted&#8230;&#8230;.But I never thought you&#8217;d be the type to do something reckless like this. I didn&#8217;t expect it at all. I don&#8217;t mean that as a compliment, you know. Although I&#8217;m glad we were able to apprehend the kidnappers. That&#8217;s a consequence, you see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From there, until we arrived at the police station, Detective Inomoto gave me a rolling lecture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still thought he was a good man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though he was preaching, the tone was only like a reminder.  Then he asked me [Do you have any questions?], I replied with [How is your relationship with Kitora-sensei going?], and that was the only part that made him really angry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Reflection. I shouldn&#8217;t make fun of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, during this sermon, I noticed that Ryoko&#8217;s eyes in the rearview mirror were giving Detective Inomoto a very dangerous look. If I didn’t tell her properly later that she shouldn&#8217;t retaliate, Detective Inomoto&#8217;s dead body might be found.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we arrived at the police station, I was taken to the interrogation room, flanked on both sides by Detective Inomoto and Ryoko.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, Ryoko was completely pinning my two arms between her breasts, which&#8230;&#8230;might have been a bit of a service.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why I was talking less than usual was because I was honestly very nervous. Otherwise, I wouldn&#8217;t be messing around with Kitora-sensei.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, thanks to the softness of Ryoko&#8217;s breasts, I felt that my nervousness had relaxed a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was left alone in the interrogation room and waited for a while, the handsome uncle came into the room with Ryoko.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ryoko&#8217;s fiancé&#8230;&#8230;right? I think he was called Inspector Nakamura?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To be honest, I didn’t have a very good impression of him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First of all, you must understand that you are a criminal, not a guest!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Where was his calmness the other day? The handsome uncle seemed to be in an absurdly bad mood, and I could see that he was irritated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think you&#8217;re doing, anyway? Do you think you&#8217;re on the side of justice, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I&#8217;m not&#8230;..I didn&#8217;t mean to&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, of course you are. As far as we sober adults are concerned, what you did was a reckless act by a dumb little shit who let his emotions get the best of him”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t give me a wishy-washy reply!　It just so happens to have led to a good outcome, and one wrong move and you could have put these girls in even more danger! Because of your stupidity!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘The girls&#8217; safety is taken care of, though.’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it would be more complicated if I talked back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230; Sorry.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If sorry was good enough, we wouldn&#8217;t need the police! Even if you won’t  be prosecuted, be prepared to be detained for a few days!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From there, he continued to shout at me for another hour or so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If Ryoko hadn&#8217;t snapped behind the handsome uncle&#8217;s back, I probably would have snapped at some point.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘How long am I going to keep this up? &#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was getting fed up with the too-long cursing, a knocking sound was heard and a young police officer rushed into the interrogation room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the police officer whispered in his ear, the handsome uncle&#8217;s face twisted in anger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who the hell are you!!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He kicked his chair and stood up, suddenly shouting at me. I didn&#8217;t understand what he meant by that. I tilted my head to see what he was talking about.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They want you released right now. I don&#8217;t know who the politician is, but he&#8217;s under pressure from the top! Shit!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The handsome man slammed the desk and glared at me, then walked out of the room with a young policeman in tow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All that was left was Ryoko and me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it wasn&#8217;t me. But still&#8230;. that man is so rude to Master. I don&#8217;t know how many times I&#8217;ve thought about shooting him from behind&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That will make a much bigger incident&#8230;&#8230;.Anyway, why is he so irritated?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No doubt he’s irritated. He&#8217;s the one who kept insisting that the Kamishima clan has nothing to do with it, and has been excluding them from the investigation.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230;&#8230;I see. In other words, he thinks that his pride was tarnished because I did something he didn&#8217;t want  to do, is that it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s a shame&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying so, Ryoko and I went down to the lobby on the first floor, and I assumed that the police had called my parents. After all, Mom and Dad were waiting for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My dad was staring at me silently, and my mom was crying.</span></p>

<p><strong>5.4 - Special news programme</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Fujiwara P.O.V]</strong></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fukuda-san!　Rin Fukuda-san!　Please come into the studio!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyah, hyiii!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A staff member shouted from the dressing room door, outside of which Fukuda-chi, next to me, jumped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll tell you again&#8230;&#8230; if you tell even one lie, you&#8217;re done. I&#8217;ll be keeping an eye on you during the recording.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I know&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fukuda-chi looked pale and nodded her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were inside the dressing room of a local station.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fukuda-chi and I came here directly from the airport this afternoon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After throwing Fukuda-chi backstage, I had a meeting with the director and producer of [Fukuda-chi&#8217;s apology program] along with the staff of the advertising agency owned by my stepfather.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, this  [Fukuda-chi&#8217;s apology program] was put on hold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was because, in the middle of the meeting, new information about the kidnapping case kept popping up one after another. After all, this was a TV news station. The information that came in was incredibly fast. And as I listened to each piece of information that came in, I almost had a stroke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That Anna-senpai was arrested. As one of the criminals in the kidnapping case.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know how to describe how I felt at this moment.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Could I describe it as a dark pleasure? It was the kind of feeling that made my cheeks unintentionally loose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An anti-social group &#8211; in short, a boy raided a yakuza&#8217;s office alone, followed by the police who received the report. In doing so, they found the girls in the office, who had been kidnapped by chance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was such a coincidence really possible?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The name of the girl who was found was also in the information. No matter how I thought about it, all the information seemed to be coming from inside the police force. Among them, I found the names of Misuzu and Masaki-chi, and I felt relieved and patted my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But what surprised me more than anything else was the name of the boy who had raided the office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──Fumio Kijima.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fuーmin!? What is he doing!?”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I jumped up unintentionally, the directors around the table turned their eyes to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, while I was relieved to confirm that Fuーmin was safe, the questions grew bigger this time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why did Fuーmin have to go into Anna-senpai&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230; yakuza&#8217;s office all by himself?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know how it happened along the way. But the reason was clear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because the other party was Anna-senpai. No matter how I thought about it, it was for my sake, wasn&#8217;t it?</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yaah!&#8230;&#8230;Aashi, he loves me so much. My boyfriend loves me too much. I mean, I love him too! I want to make out with Fu–min right now. I want to hold him, I want to hold him.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: Fujiwara uses Aashi albeit different from Kurosawa referring herself using atashi instead  the causal Watashi]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unexpectedly, my head went into a thermal runaway.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, a casual remark by the director threw cold water on my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s interesting, but this boy will probably be detained. If he&#8217;s not careful, he&#8217;ll probably be prosecuted. He&#8217;s got a criminal record at his age &#8211; that&#8217;s amazing in a way.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That’s a good joke. I’m not letting that happen!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I ran out of the meeting room and tapped my phone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the phone was connected, I gasped for air and pleaded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stepfather, I have a favor&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm, hmmm, hmmm ♪”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hummed as I took off my uniform and turned on the TV with the remote control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was in a good mood. Today, I ate lunch with Junichi-sama while comforting him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put on a sober face and said, [Don&#8217;t worry, cheer up! Kurosawa-san will be back soon] but in my heart I chuckled, [There&#8217;s no way she&#8217;ll be back].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that Kurosawa was gone, the girl who was closest to Junichi-sama was, by all accounts, me &#8211; Hikari Teruya.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our love that was born from continually consoling the heartbroken Junichi-sama. I was sure that Junichi-sama would soon fall in love with me. It was smooth sailing, I&#8217;d say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school, I went to the club activities&#8230;&#8230;but Ninagawa and I only had a brief track time together. Then we went back to the dorm, had dinner in the cafeteria, and just got back to my room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tonight, I had a series of dramas to look forward to. Today was the last episode, and I definitely didn’t want to miss it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my uniform on a hanger and slipped on a T-shirt. As soon as I pulled up my shorts and switched on the TV, the sound of an emergency alert echoed through the air, and a message began to appear in white letters on the screen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I saw it, I stood there stunned, my hand still holding the remote control.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A,Aneki got caught!? Mass abduction of schoolgirls&#8230;&#8230;The girls were released safely? What&#8230;&#8230; what&#8217;s going on?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was not joking. My love story with Junichi-sama was just getting started&#8230;.No, it was not a situation where you could call it a love story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If my own sister kidnapped one of our students, of course I would be suspected, and I would have no place at school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, my school fees and living expenses were all paid for by my sister. If my sister was arrested, all of that would stop. If that happened, I didn’t even know how to live anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a lie! This is all a lie! This is bullshit!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The track and field club girls’ kidnapping was not my sister&#8217;s doing. My sister would never lie to me. If she said she didn&#8217;t do it, then she really didn&#8217;t do it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There must be some mistake &#8211; I changed the channels one after another with a clinging feeling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hoped that somewhere, it would be reported as a mistake.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then,  I stopped changing the channel as I saw a special news programme. The programme title was 『Massive Kidnapping &#8211; What Happened to the Girls』 .</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After arriving home from the police station, my mother fell ill and went to bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My dad just said that and retired to the bedroom with mother.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took a cup of ramen out of the kitchen cupboard and poured hot water into it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ooo, Is this another lonely dinner Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili, who was floating in the air, said teasingly, and I twitched my lips in annoyance then said, [Shut up].</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held the lid of the cup of ramen with my chopsticks and turned on the TV in the living room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt like it had been a long time since I&#8217;ve watched television. Well, that was probably true. I had been spending most nights with the girls for a while now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I carelessly changed channels, the screen showed a 『Special News Report』and the title of the programme, 『Massive Kidnapping &#8211; What Happened to the Girls』, appeared on the screen, and that was when I stopped holding the remote control.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered what kind of news they were reporting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Today, we&#8217;re going to change the schedule to the large-scale kidnapping of a young girl that has caused a stir in the public over the past few weeks. It seems to be called &#8216;the case of the godforsaken&#8217; on the internet and elsewhere, but I&#8217;d like to thoroughly examine this case.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Several figures were seated at a semi-circular table with the presenter and female announcer, which was familiar from the noon information programmes, in the middle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『These are today&#8217;s commentators. First is Professor Hiroya Tanaka, a professor at the University of Law and Economics and an expert in social pathology. Next, Yoshitake&#8230;&#8230;a researcher at Tokyo Metropolitan University who is an expert in criminal psychology.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guests were introduced in order.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, it was strange that these types of information programmes always included comedians and idols.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understood that it was necessary to have the public&#8217;s point of view, but the subtly off-the-wall 『public』 comments of TV celebrities who were used to television tended to dominate the programme.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After three minutes of thinking about this, I opened the lid of my ramen and slurped the noodles. Yes, it tasted good sometimes. The seafood flavour was particularly special.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I continued to stare blankly at the screen&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Lastly, on behalf of the students of the school where this incident took place, we have first-year student Fukuda Rin-san here with us.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“P&#8230; Please take care of me&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Buhuhuuuuu!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin Fukuda, looking like she was about to die, was on the big screen and I spewed a big bowl of ramen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gohoo, Gohoo, w-w-w-what is she doing there!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“FumiFumi! Look! You&#8217;re going to spill the soup on the carpet, Devi? Is that okay, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that&#8217;s not good.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rushed to the kitchen to get a rag and wiped up the ramen soup that had been smeared on the low table. Of course, all the while, my eyes were glued to the TV.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Now, let&#8217;s look back at the incident.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The screen switched to an illustration and narration explaining the circumstances of the incident, with frightening music in the background</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The incident began when a third-year girl, K-san, went missing. This was followed a few days later by the disappearance of K-san&#8217;s best friend, H-san, from her room in the middle of the night.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">K was Kurosawa-san, and H was probably Haneda&#8230;&#8230; Masaki.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Thirteen days later, K-san was found in front of the main gate of the school in the same clothes she was wearing when she went missing, and she testified that she had no memory of the time she was missing. A few days later, another incident occurred, this time 18 of the 20 members of the girls&#8217; track and field club went missing altogether after school.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In truth, Ryoko and Kyoko were also locked up during that time, but since they were not discovered by the public, it was not surprising that they were not included in this story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『And furthermore, a first-year girl, F-san, goes missing.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost spewed my ramen again, but I stopped myself. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yeah, I should probably stop eating it now.’</span></i></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Because&#8230;&#8230;that F-san is in the studio right now, right? That&#8217;s F-san who looks like she&#8217;s about to die at the edge of the screen, isn&#8217;t it?’</span></i></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『F-san disappeared after writing that a third-year boy called K-san was the culprit, and this K student was attacked and injured by someone on his way home.』”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Sorry, no more food to spew anymore..that K-san is definitely me, for all intents and purposes. I mean, how, how does the media know about that!?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at Lili and she shook her head, [It&#8217;s not Lili, Devi].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Actually, this F-san had asked K-san for a relationship but was turned down, so she staged her own kidnapping in order to give K-san the stigma of being a kidnapper.』”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘They’re too detailed about the circumstances…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『And yesterday, this Boy K returned home together with K-san, the schoolgirl. This K-san is the third-year schoolgirl who was kidnapped first. And she was forcibly kidnapped again in a black van while she was on her way home with this Boy K.』”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Aside from the fact that Kasuya-kun is not in the story, the information is far too detailed. Where on earth do they get this story from?…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『But here the incident takes an unexpected turn. The following day, K-san, a male student, went alone into the offices of the yakuza organisation. It is not known at this stage why he did this, but when the police raided the office after receiving a report of a fight between yakuza  organisations, they found K-san confronting the members and the abducted schoolgirls!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, the screen switched to show footage of me coming out of the yakuza office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Me and the girls coming out with blankets over our heads. The atmosphere was noisy, but fortunately none of our faces were shown.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The screen then switched back to the host.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『So it looks like the culprit has been arrested and the case has been sorted out, but there are still some schoolgirls who haven&#8217;t been found, right?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Yes, four first-year students from the women&#8217;s track and field club have yet to be found, and the police are going to pursue this matter closely.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The host turned to the commentator as the analyst responded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Tanaka-sensei, what do you think about this case? 』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Yes. It&#8217;s a large-scale kidnapping that is unprecedented in Japan&#8217;s criminal history, but it&#8217;s hard to imagine the scale of the yakuza that was caught this time. I think that perhaps a larger criminal organisation is involved behind it.』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I see.』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, the comedian interjected.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『This F girl is a horrible person. She has nothing to do with the kidnapping itself, right? In my opinion, she&#8217;s the most unforgivable.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Rin Fukuda, at the edge of the screen, jumped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『That&#8217;s right. Using other people&#8217;s misfortune to take revenge on the man who rejected her, she is a lousy girl, isn’t she? You are from the same school, aren&#8217;t you?　Do you know her? What kind of girl is she?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Enka singer spoke to Rin Fukuda.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: Enka,traditional Japanese music]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Aa,ahaha&#8230;&#8230;she’s,well, a normal girl, you know.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin Fukuda answered with her eyes swimming wildly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were asked to comment on myself, well, that would be the answer.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nishish, this is interesting Devi! From Lili&#8217;s point of view, I&#8217;d like to make it a bit more interesting, Devi…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Lili suddenly disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sight of Rin Fukuda on TV was too much to bear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But suddenly she stared around the side of the camera and her cheeks twitched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps someone was watching her. After a pause for breath, she opened her mouth again, looking like she was about to cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Oh, um, &#8230;&#8230; ugh, I didn&#8217;t mean to lie, but &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m really self-conscious a-and, I&#8217;m the type of person who doesn&#8217;t like it when I&#8217;m not at the centre of the conversation. I&#8217;m the type of person who needs to be pampered&#8230;&#8230; or I&#8217;m the type of person who wants to look good even if it means bringing others down,&#8230;&#8230; and that&#8217;s the type of person I am..』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that the instruction was to answer the question properly. My impression was that she was surprisingly good at self-analysis.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the professor&#8217;s relentless pursuit of her comments.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Excessive self-love and excessive self-pity. This is the so-called monster child. In Europe and the United States, this kind of behavior is corrected from an early age through counseling, but Japan lags behind in this field. Japanese people called them in funny way as 『Kamatte-chan』 and let them go unchecked. They are just plain sociopaths. I think they should be locked up in an institution of some kind.』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL: Credits to TinyTL: Kamatte-chan (構ってちゃん) is a terms for someone who is an attention-seeker]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Society&#8230;&#8230; Unsuitable&#8230;&#8230;』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Fukuda-san, you should probably stay away from that girl.』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『A&#8230;&#8230; ahaha&#8230;&#8230;』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had never heard such a lacklustre [ahaha] before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From there, commentators made a series of bludgeoning comments about the schoolgirl F.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin Fukuda no longer had any life left in her. She was not breathing. At the edge of the screen, she was dropping so low that her whiskers were reflected in the screen. For those of us who know that Girl F was Rin Fukuda, it was a public execution with no mercy. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the schoolgirl F-bashing had died down for a moment she must have tried to change the subject. But the researcher, who was an expert in criminal psychology, opened his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『If I may. I think this Boy K is the problem. He pretends to be a hero. It&#8217;s insane that he rushed into the office of a gang. It is these out-of-control civilians that complicate the investigation&#8230;&#8230;』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when he had said that much, the host interrupted the conversation and the programme abruptly went to commercial. When the commercial break was over, the researcher in question was nowhere to be seen, and there was a huge stuffed bear on the seat where he was sitting, which was extremely unnatural. Biased reporting, at its finest.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s messed up…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was twitching my cheeks, Lili reappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m home, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where have you been?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To make this show more interesting, I gave them an anonymous tip, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anonymous tip?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost as soon as I involuntarily tilted my head, the host hurriedly opened his mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Er, during the commercial, a viewer provided information. Our staff have checked it out and it seems to be quite conclusive evidence. It&#8217;s audio only, so please listen first.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The screen showed the serious expressions of the commentators in turn. Rin Fukuda was the only one with a questioning face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the conversation between Kasuya-kun and his juniors began to flow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The commentary about Kurosawa was cut out, and the names of people were covered with a &#8216;beep&#8217;, but anyone listening would easily be able to tell who was talking to whom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave Lili a jittery look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re really the Devil.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Indeed, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After exchanging such a conversation that had become a promise, I let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me, I was going to end my revenge against Kasuya-kun with the next move, but if Lili had put out this audio, it would be overkill.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『This is the conversation between the students who were seduced by F-san and attacked K-san&#8230;..』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the host opened his mouth, the Enka singer looked as if she had smelled a pest, and muttered, 『It sounds like a school with a lot of problems』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere in the studio must be terrible. But then the comedian suddenly made his move.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I get it now. This K boy must have been really cornered and had no choice but to go into the yakuza office. When he found out that these yakuza people had kidnapped the girls, he thought he had to do something about it, so he went in. I think he&#8217;s very brave&#8230;&#8230;.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『That&#8217;s right. This case was almost solved thanks to this boy.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, I felt I understood why comedians and TV personalities were placed on these programmes as commentators. They were the adjuster of the atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The flow of the programme gradually tilted towards celebrating schoolboy K as the hero who had solved this case. And all the way to the end of the programme, Rin Fukuda just kept on exposing her whiskers to the general audience without any relation to it.</span></p>
