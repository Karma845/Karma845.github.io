<h3>Chapter 6: Overkill as a Cause and Effect</h3>

<p><strong>6.1 - Retaining the Invisible Woman</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A week had passed since the day I stormed into the yakuza office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking back, the environment surrounding me had changed radically &#8211; if not drastically &#8211; in the past week alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reaction to the special news programme was tremendous, both inside and outside the school, and it caused a huge stir.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this age of falling birthrates and an ageing population, securing students was the biggest challenge for public schools.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If a school was in the scene of a large-scale kidnapping and was then described by a TV commentator as a 『terrible school』, the negative image of the school was fatal. It was not something that could easily be wiped out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A decrease in the number of applicants for the next year was inevitable, and if the number of applicants decreased, the deviation score would decrease, and if the deviation score decreased, the number of applicants would decrease even more, which was a vicious circle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it was often misunderstood, public schools were for-profit organisations that sold the product of education, not charities. A decline in the number of students meant a reduction in income, and it was quite possible that the school could go out of business.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, the board was furious. Unable to hold the kidnappers, who had already been caught, accountable, their anger was directed at the students who caused the problem.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, the attack on me by first-year students of the football club was thoroughly investigated, although it did not result in a criminal case, and Kasuya-kun and the first-year students in question were suspended indefinitely. The football club was closed down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, the club members who had nothing to do with it were not happy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Their anger was naturally directed at Kasuya-kun and the others. When the suspensions were lifted, there would no longer be a place for them at school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, Teruya-san, the biological sister of the kidnapper, Anna Kamishima, apparently left the dormitory the day after the special news programme, submitting a notice of withdrawal to the school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know what happened to her after that, but there were some untrue rumours that she was working in a girls&#8217; bar in the neighbouring prefecture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And how did the boy in question, K, in other words me, feel? I thought I was treated a little better&#8230;..although I was far from a hero.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, at best, the name 『Kimojima』 had changed to 『Kijima-kun』. Rather than being popular, I was thought of, mainly by boys, as 『a bad guy who goes into the yakuza office by himself. It&#8217;s better not to get involved with him』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t have any friends to begin with, so there were no hurtful feelings, but if I had friends, I would have almost lost them. Yes, it was really dangerous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, as for the girls&#8230;..I honestly didn’t know. My impression was that more girls were returning my greetings, to be honest. That was my impression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fujiwara-san said: [It&#8217;s troubling that more and more people are showing their eyes to Fu–min. It&#8217;s too late for them to realise how good Fumin is now!] But I didn’t feel anything like that at all. It was a pity, really.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that was not to say that outside of class there hadn’t been real and palpable changes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, I was now heading to school hand in hand with a lovely girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was Saori Moribe. She was a first-year student and a member of the liberated athletics club.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason why I was going to school hand in hand with such a girl was because last night, she came all the way to my house with her parents to say hello.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the parents bowed deeply at the door and said, [Thank you very much for rescuing our Saori], I was embarrassed. After all, I was the culprit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at that time, her mother asked me to do something for her. She was worried that she might be abducted again. [&#8230;.If it wouldn&#8217;t be too much trouble, would you mind accompanying her to school in the morning?].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got to go to school with a pretty girl. I could only call it a reward. When I agreed to it without a second thought, I could see her expression light up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, I&#8217;ll be&#8230;&#8230;in your care from tomorrow onwards. Onii-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really thought I could eat three bowls of rice just from the sound of that 『Onii-chan』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong? Onii-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, sorry, I was just thinking something.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smiled, and she smiled back at me, the corners of her eyes lowered and squishy.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;&#8230;What a lovely creature.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was a lovely girl with a ladylike atmosphere, with bangs and shoulder-length black hair. She was petite, with a baby face and infantile body shape, and she looked quiet and timid&#8230;&#8230;Even I, who had a slight S tendency, was like a chihuahua who was intensely tickled by the desire for protection.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard that even in primary school, I used to take her hand and go to school with her, and she and I were supposed to be childhood friends &#8230;..who lived in the same residential area, but to be honest, it felt quite strange to say so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Somehow, I didn&#8217;t remember a single thing about her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left Saori-chan at the school gate and headed to my classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Kijima-kun, good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go, good morning&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stepped into the classroom, I was greeted by several girls and I took my seat, still in the same creepy way. However, the most unintelligible thing that had happened recently was that I was now being called cute instead of creepy in the same creepy way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, Fujiwara-san entered the classroom saying, [Chorissu!] . </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ohayo, Fu–min! Ehehe &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She threw her bag down on the seat next to mine and clung to my arm with her chair attached to mine. For my classmates, this would no longer be an unusual scene.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few minutes later, Masaki-chan and Kurosawa-san entered the classroom together.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two victims of this kidnapping incident. As it was their first day of school after the incident, the air in the classroom was instantly filled with tension. However, the girls themselves did not seem to mind the stares of their classmates.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumio-kun, good morning.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Fumio.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girls didn&#8217;t head for their seats, but came straight towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misuzu, Masaki-chi! Good morning, I see you&#8217;re coming today!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I could return the greeting, Fujiwara-san raised her hand and Masaki-chan replied, [Good morning, Mai-chan], while Masaki-chan carried a chair from the seat next to her with an [unsho], sat down, and clung to my arm, the arm opposite to Fujiwara-san, as it was.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh!? Wait, wait! Masaki-chi! What are you doing to my boyfriend!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I saw Masaki-chan&#8217;s powerful breasts swallowing my arms, Fujiwara-san raised her voice, astonished at the sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What exactly am I doing? Of course, I&#8217;d like to express my gratitude to him. It&#8217;s my way of saying thank you for saving me from the yakuza. Oh right, Fumio-kun also loves me so much that he wrote me a love letter, so I thought he&#8217;d like it if I did this for him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Love letters are a thing of the past! He&#8217;s my boyfriend now!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, Mai-chan, shouldn&#8217;t you be proud when your boyfriend is so popular with the girls?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? &#8230;&#8230;Well, yeah, I guess so.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, it’s not a problem. Come on, Misuzu-chan, let&#8217;s do it too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, wa!? Wait!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fujiwara-san&#8217;s eyes were black and white as she was forced to deal with Masaki-chan&#8217;s incomprehensible logic. On the other hand, Kurosawa-san was somewhat fidgety.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aa, I don&#8217;t really think of&#8230;..Fumio as anything, but I&#8217;m embarrassed&#8230;&#8230;in a place like this&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your tsundere hasn&#8217;t been cured yet, huh?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Masaki let out an exasperated voice, Kurosawa-san tried to control her anger.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t talk to me like I&#8217;m sick! All right,I get it! already!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Kurosawa-san hugged me from behind, [Ei].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-i-i-i-it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m trying to get attached to Fumio, you know! Please don&#8217;t get me wrong!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;I received a superb tsundere. Thank you.’</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a paradise of big tits, beautiful tits and poor tits in the early morning. The boys&#8217; stares were painful, but on the other hand, if I listened to the voices leaking from the girls&#8217; side…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He saved their life, so it&#8217;s only natural that they fell in love with him, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s going to be tough for you from now on, Mai-chan.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lately, Kijima-kun is looking good. Kasuya-kun can&#8217;t do anything about it if he&#8217;s like that, and Kurosawa-san might be thinking about switching.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, it&#8217;s kind of cute when Kijima-kun is embarrassed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──For some reason they were quite favourable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps she couldn&#8217;t say anything strongly with these two as her opponents, but Fujiwara-san jiggled her legs and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mouu!! Both of you! You can do it until class begins! But once class starts, Fu–min is all mine!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;. I mean, you should also stay away from me during class, Fujiwara-san.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And every time we entered recess, the same exchange between Kurosawa-san, Masaki-chan and Fujiwara-san was repeated, and the gazes of our classmates turned sweet and warm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a noisy recess, when fourth period classes were about to begin, Lili suddenly appeared in mid-air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“FumiFumi, we&#8217;re heading to the roof right now, Devi. It&#8217;s time to help people, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She smiled with her double teeth bared.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I&#8217;ve got a bad feeling about the devil helping people&#8230;&#8230;.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you can leave it alone, Devi&#8230; But it&#8217;s also kind of annoying to be depressed by FumiFumi, Devi. Don&#8217;t be shy, feel free to fuck her, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Feel free to fuck her…you think that’s helping people?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, well, you&#8217;ll understand when you get there, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, I didn’t get it at all. But since Lili went to the trouble of showing up at the school, there must be a good reason for it.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fujiwara-san&#8230;&#8230; I forgot to use the restroom. I&#8217;m gonna go now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, class is about to start, hey, Fu–min, Fu–min!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook off her hand and ran out of the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Fukada Rin P.O.V]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t do this anymore&#8230;&#8230;.I can&#8217;t do this&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard my own voice in my ears, moist with tears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my hand on the rooftop fence and muttered to myself.</span></p>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The events of that worst day had been sitting in my head and would not go away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day I became invisible, the day I was nowhere to be found.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The day after that news special, I had planned to miss school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I went to school, the teachers would probably be angry with me. That was what I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But a certain android from the future came to pick me up at the dormitory.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『I will never allow you to take a day off.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fujiwara-senpai said so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t want to get angry. I thought that I could somehow get away with it, but I had already learned to my disgust that it was useless to resist.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reluctantly packed up and left my dorm room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But my perception was too naive. Only the teachers would be angry with me? It was laughable. That was not going to be the end of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I entered the classroom, cold stares pierced me at once. And when I turned to look at them, they all looked away quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“M,morin….”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The boy sitting next to me, who always glanced at me, also looked away silently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, um&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I tried to speak to him, the boy in the seat in front of me walked away silently.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘W,What&#8230;..this?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I sat still, the sound of girls in my class talking jumped into my ears&#8230;&#8230;.talking about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How could that girl come to school? Is she stupid?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean&#8230;&#8230;she&#8217;s so gutless. If you get involved with her, you never know what kind of accusations she will make against you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;re framed as a kidnapper like Kijima-senpai, it&#8217;ll be a disaster.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look, look, you were called a sociopath on TV. She can&#8217;t read the atmosphere. Although everyone hated her before, she didn&#8217;t understand it at all. She wanted to be pampered by men, so she was acting pretentious.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That day, I spent the whole day downcast. It was the worst day of my life.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But that wasn&#8217;t the end of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I returned to the dormitory, all my stuff had been taken out of my room in the corridor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked the head of the dormitory who was there and she sniffed annoyingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your roommate said she didn&#8217;t want to share a room with Fukuda-san. The other girls all said they didn&#8217;t like it either. Can you please move to a single room?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus I was moved to a corner room on the second floor. It was a windowless three-mat room, which until yesterday had been used as a storeroom. No bed, a set of futons and no  furniture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was hopeless. I didn’t want to go any more. But even when I whined that I didn&#8217;t want to go to school, that android from the future would force me to come and pick me up every morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s like, [If you don&#8217;t do what I say, your family will be in trouble.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I left class, no one would worry about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t know how many days I hadn’t spoken to people properly. I was not asking them to pamper me, but I wanted them at least not to  treat me like an air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe I should just die&#8230;&#8230;Maybe then it would be easier&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Through the fence, I looked into the schoolyard from the rooftop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt like I was being sucked in. Now it would be during PE class. There were lots of pupils on the ground. If I jumped down, they would notice me immediately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Would the student who ignored me feel a little guilty?　Or would they laugh and say they were  happy? But if they were still indifferent&#8230;&#8230;I didn’t like that. </span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, okay. If it makes them feel better&#8230;&#8230;that&#8217;s good.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tiptoed over the fence to end it all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I heard a man&#8217;s voice behind me. It sounded familiar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve looked a lot shabbier in the little time I&#8217;ve been away…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked behind me and there he was &#8211; that creepy guy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh, what do you want? It&#8217;s all your fault&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, I thought I look pretty shabby now. My hair was shaggy. I didn’t take care of  my skin at all. There was  no point in dressing up if no one would take me seriously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thinking of killing yourself?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I&#8217;m going to jump now! It&#8217;s your fault!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Something was strange. I was happy about the fact that he was talking to me, even though I didn&#8217;t want to see his face. I didn&#8217;t want to admit it, but I was very, very happy that someone responded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if the reply was lousy [Hmm, well, it&#8217;s a waste of time, let me do you once before you die].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa!? Are you kidding me&#8230;..!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kimo-buta immediately grabbed my chest and forcefully held me against the fence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re in no position to talk back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll tell you what! I&#8217;m going to tell them that you&#8217;ve been raping me!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You know&#8230;&#8230; between you and me. Who do you think people will believe?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They&#8217;ll just think you&#8217;re crazy again, right? Nobody&#8217;s going to believe you anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“U,uuu&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could only nod my head. That was a fact.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, Kimo-buta pressed his lips to mine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230;&#8230; stop&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tried to hate it, but I couldn’t shake it off. One of his hands twisted up my breast and simultaneously his other hand touched her skirt. His hands were incredibly experienced. As his fingers crawled across my breasts and between my legs, I was terrified that, with incredible speed, my disgust was being replaced by pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh no, don&#8217;t&#8230;&#8230;an, yu, let me go&#8230;&#8230;aaa, ah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found that my underwear had been pulled down and my breasts were bare.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Wh,Why is this guy so skilled at this&#8230;&#8230;?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you sure? I&#8217;m the only person who cares about you, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeh&#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You want attention, don&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, but&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment I was involuntarily confused, he made me turn my back to him and pressed my cheek against the fence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, no. That&#8217;s not the answer. All you have to say to me is『yes』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, something hard touched my crotch. Unexpectedly, I felt a rush of blood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiii!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, something entered me, as if prying my groin open.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouch, ouch, no, stop, it&#8217;s ripping, it&#8217;s ripping!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But he didn’t stop. The more I tried to deny him and tried to escape from his hips, the more it slithered in and out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Noo, it hurts, it hurts, stop it, stop it&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are now, my masturbator!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I screamed [Gyaaa] as I felt a big stick ripping me apart. A mixture of pain and heat. My whole body was inexplicably on fire, and cold sweat ran down my skin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s my first time&#8230;&#8230; you are terrible&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The pain made my tear glands hot, and if I looked at the joint, I could see that Kimo-buta’s extremely thick thing was stuck into the base. It was a shocking sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ve got a terrible personality, but you&#8217;ve got a pretty good one here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuuuu&#8230; t-that&#8217;s enough&#8230;&#8230; j-just pull it out already!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you stupid? It&#8217;s sex until I move and come inside you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t talk to me like it&#8217;s a field trip&#8230;.hyan!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The slightest movement of his hips was followed by a sharp pain that felt like salt being applied to the wound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ouch, it hurts!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how much I screamed and complained about the pain, the Kimo-buta did not stop moving his hips. I felt as if my body was being ripped to pieces. But&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good, not bad. Rin&#8217;s pussy is pretty good.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It would be so much cuter if you just stayed in my arms like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Your facial expressions are fake, but when you get fucked, you look amazing”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whenever Kimo-buta said this to me, I felt an itch in my groin, even though I was uncomfortable, even though I was supposed to be uncomfortable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grabbed Rin Fukuda by the hair, wiped off the semen clinging to my penis with it and lifted up my trousers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa, haa&#8230;you’re the worst…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin stared at me as she collapsed into a crumpled heap, dripping bloody white fluid from between her legs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was breathing hard, her hands clutching the fence with her fingers, like a defeated boxer leaning against the corner post. I didn’t know if she was aware of it or not, but there was a life in her eyes that was different from before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rin, come here tomorrow at this time. I&#8217;ll be here for you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who&#8217;s coming to&#8230;&#8230;you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you&#8217;re gonna come. There&#8217;s no one but me for a stupid girl like you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, I&#8217;m not coming. You&#8217;re an idiot.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also, you should clean up a bit when you meet me. Then you&#8217;ll be pretty in your own way.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Listen to me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it&#8217;s almost lunchtime. If you want to be seen, then so be it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She hurriedly pulled down her skirt, which was rolled up, and closed her crotch. Then she ran a hand through her hair as she buttoned up her blouse and scowled grandly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaa&#8230;&#8230;my hair is sticky. What are you going to do about it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry, no one will notice. Cause nobody&#8217;s looking at you anymore.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I threw a handkerchief in her direction and left the rooftop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tomorrow, she would be here again. I had no doubt that she would be here again tomorrow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hatsu-chan said she was saying goodbye to her boyfriend, so I followed her as an onlooker&#8230;&#8230;or chaperone, and we faced each other in the middle of the corridor for just one minute. This exchange was the end of it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiratsuka-kun is a good man after all. I am proud to have been in love with him, even if only for a moment.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hatsu-chan nodded with a clear face as she stared at his back as he walked away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s so simple&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was so worried about Hatsu-chan that I reflexively said, [I&#8217;m staying too], but I didn’t understand this position as a servant either. I was just worried.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, in the end, you said he was going to let me come and go freely between this 『room』 and that 『room』, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, but originally, that&#8217;s the privilege of a favoured princess. I was scolded for promising something arbitrary. So, the next time I share a bedroom with him, I will be punished for creating the role of servant without permission.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can&#8217;t be helped. There is such an expression as [sweet night], you know, Shima. It&#8217;s really sweet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hatsu-chan had always been a girl who worked hard at everything, but when her vector turned towards men, she became like this, and I couldn’t help but let out a sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As for myself, I&#8217;m going to have a door installed in my room that leads to that room, so I&#8217;ll be able to come and go whenever I want, but for everyone else, you&#8217;ll either have to come to my house or ask the Confinement King to pick you up. It&#8217;s a bit of a hassle at first, but I&#8217;ve heard that once he sets foot in a place, he can open the door at that place anytime. It should be smooth the second time around.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everywhere you go&#8230;&#8230;you know, Hatsu-chan, we&#8217;re getting used to it, but&#8230;..I know the  Confinement King is a mess.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, he&#8217;s the Confinement King.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told him this, his eyes widened for a moment, then he quickly regained his composure and asked probingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you talking about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Anna Kamishima confessed, Nakamura.

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Anna Kamishima must have known that Inspector Nakamura was my fiancee. And she may have wanted to see me despair out of spite of her arrest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All of them denied kidnapping the girls in the track and field team and Masaki-sama. Of course they did. In fact, it was not them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They all said that those girls came out of nowhere, but unfortunately, they came out of the back parlour where there was not even a window.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All the circumstantial evidence indicated that they were locked in by them. The physical evidence alone would be sufficient to prosecute the case. There was not a chance in the world that Master would be suspected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quietly told Nakamura, who was staring at a spot on the desk.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, yes. Kamishima was not involved in the kidnapping of the girls’ track and field team at all, that&#8217;s what she said. She said she was&#8230;&#8230;not comfortable being suspected, so she told me that if I tried to get involved with the Kamishima clan, she would have her fiancée&#8230;&#8230;i.e. you, kidnapped by the continental mafia.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Continental mafia?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you know, it is nearly impossible to protect an individual who has been targeted by the continental mafia. If Anna Kamishima is arrested, she’ll ask them to kidnap you, my fiancé. It is clear from the scale of the case that the Kamishima clan is not involved in it&#8230;&#8230;or so I thought.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They took your fiancée as a hostage and you offered her a favour.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was about to pick up another coin and throw it in when──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi, Jun. What are you doing here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up to see a man wearing a light parka with a hood over his head.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you, a hikikomori?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under the hood was the face of Masahiro Tachioka, a long-time classmate with long hair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not that I want to be a hikikomori. I heard from my little sister that you&#8217;ve been in a lot of trouble.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;.it wasn&#8217;t all that bad.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were framed, just like me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Framed? By who?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I could figure it out, I wouldn&#8217;t have a problem. But somehow, through a series of contacts, I&#8217;ve managed to get some help from someone who might be able to find it for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Someone who might find it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I don&#8217;t know who it is, I can&#8217;t do anything about it. You&#8217;ve heard of Detective JK, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaa?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, I had heard of it, but it was kind of a story on the internet. As I recall, they had a special eye for detecting lies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oi,oi,oi&#8230;&#8230;are you okay in the head?　It&#8217;s like an urban legend, you know?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I&#8217;m not surprised you don&#8217;t believe me. Call me when you feel like it, because the more allies you can trust, the better.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masahiro gave a small shrug and left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at my watch. It was only around fourteen o&#8217;clock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s going to be a long day&#8230;&#8230;” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered to myself, and put coins into the game again.</span></p>

<p><strong>6.3 - Maybe Women are all Demons</strong></p>

<p><strong>[Kasuya P.O.V]</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu…uu…..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My eyelids were heavy. I woke up with a light headache.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately aware of my situation, a chill ran down my spine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh,wha,wha…what the hell is this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next thing I knew, I was sitting in a wheelchair with my hands and feet restrained by what looked like leather belts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My heart pulsed violently and the sound of my own rough breathing descended into the room.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What’s this? What&#8217;s going on? What&#8217;s happening?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I desperately tried to remember.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After killing some time in the arcade, I entered La Vian Rose, thinking it was a little early. As soon as I stepped into the room, I felt something like an electric current and lost consciousness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, you&#8217;ve been asleep for quite a while Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I heard a girl&#8217;s voice and I looked around in a panic. Then I saw a red-haired girl with horns floating in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-w-what the hell are you! You! Why are you floating!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s a good and fresh reaction, Devi. Thank you for accepting Lili&#8217;s invitation today, Devi.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Invitation? I have no idea what you&#8217;re talking about!　I promised Misuzu that I would&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, that&#8217;s all from Lili, Devi. I told Kurosawa-chan to cheer you up, but she said she didn&#8217;t want to, so Lili had no choice but to cheer Kasuya up, Devi. Was it really like Kurosawa-chan, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?　You&#8217;re talking nonsense!　I get it, you’re the one who kidnapped Misuzu!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, maybe you&#8217;re right, but maybe you&#8217;re wrong, Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Screw you! Take these off! Release Misuzu and me! You little shit!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I yelled at her but this kid shrugged her shoulders in an exaggerated manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not good behaviour to talk to an older person like that, Devi. Either way, I will take you to Kurosawa-chan as you wish, and Kurosawa-chan is not restrained in any way, Devi. Well, it&#8217;s too late for Kasuya to realise, she&#8217;s already had about four rounds, so she&#8217;s in a bit of a mess, Devi&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The horned kid waved her hand and the wheelchair started to move by itself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O,Oiy! What the hell? What are you doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll take you to see Kurosawa-chan, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The front door opened, and the wheelchair entered the room, which turned out to be a very luxurious room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of the room was a huge bed with a canopy that could easily accommodate ten people. A woman was sitting on it. No, it was not. She was not sitting on the bed. She was sitting on a man.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was sitting on her back, with her body facing us, while sucking the man’s cock into her crotch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn….ahn…aa…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wearing a white veil on her head and white underwear full of frills, which looked like a wedding dress, and was slowly moving her hips. </span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as soon as she looked up, I was speechless.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mi, are you Misuzu &#8230;&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hid my face behind Kurosawa-san&#8217;s back and peeked at Kasuya-kun. He was restrained to a wheelchair, looking a little haggard and wide-eyed in astonishment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, Kurosawa-san was reluctant to go through with this plan. It wasn&#8217;t that she had any lingering feelings for Kasuya-kun, but that she simply felt sorry for him, so I insisted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『If you don&#8217;t completely blow him off, he&#8217;ll keep following you around forever』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I told her this and she reluctantly agreed, but when it came time for the real thing, she was getting into the mood and said she would show Kasuya-kun how much she and I were in love with each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahhaa, Jun-kun, what&#8217;s the matter? You look like an idiot, did you forget your words because of the shock?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mi, Misuzu&#8230;..hey, why are you wearing that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because, today is a special day. Ahaa…!! Jun-kun, do you know how happy I am right now! Aahaann, Mouu.. don&#8217;t move&#8230;&#8230; I have to tell him.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y, You&#8217;re being threatened, aren&#8217;t you? After all, you&#8217;re dressed like that! I&#8217;ll help you in a minute!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha..How are you going to help me? Iyaann…watch carefully, this is your last chance to see my body.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Last&#8230;&#8230;chance?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Kasuya-kun muttered in a daze, Misuzu began to move her hips vigorously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnn, Ah, Ahhh, look at this, if I don&#8217;t move my legs like this, I can&#8217;t get Fumio-kun’s big cock in here!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha?! Misuzu?!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasuya&#8217;s eyes peeled back as if his eyeballs were about to spill out, a look of astonishment on his face. As I watched him, I looked over Kurosawa-san&#8217;s shoulder.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Kasuya-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y,you! Kimo-jima! I&#8217;ll never forgive you! Get away! Get away from Misuzu!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ummm&#8230;&#8230;I can stop, but&#8230;Kurosawa-san, do you want to follow what Kazuya-kun says?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I rubbed her breasts and asked her that in her ear while running my fingers over her clitoris.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No! No! I&#8217;m in the right place now&#8230;..Sorry, Jun-kun. I&#8217;m now exclusive to Fumi-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you understand now? Kurosawa-san won&#8217;t let go of me, you know. Kurosawa-san&#8217;s vagina is firmly sucking my cock into her vagina.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I said this, I squeezed her breasts even harder, causing her to look dishevelled and she moaned helplessly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnhhaa&#8230; It&#8217;s so good to have my breast squeezed while being penetrated, Nnnh&#8230; More, more, I want more…”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh…what did you&#8230;&#8230;do?　What did you do to her, you bastard!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kasuya-kun shouted angrily, Kurosawa-san&#8217;s lips twitched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mooou&#8230; Jun-kun, be quiet and watch me. I remember &#8230;&#8230;the first time I was locked up, this penis taught me a lot about women&#8217;s pleasure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The first time you were locked up&#8230;&#8230;? T-then, when you came back, you were already&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right&#8230;&#8230; Jun-kun&#8217;s little, tiny, no-good cock was not enough, after all, I had already been taught by Fumi-kun&#8217;s big cock.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san slightly raised her hips, pulled out the meat stick halfway from her vagina, and thrusted her hips out with a face like a child showing off his toys.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look&#8230;it&#8217;s so hot, being spread out like this&#8230; I&#8217;ve already become Fumi&#8217;s personal meat hole! I&#8217;ve become his all you can eat sex wife!”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasuya-kun&#8217;s eyes were glued to the area where she and I were joined.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kurosawa-san’s hole feels great. I&#8217;ll use it more and more.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahahah &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m so happy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she smiled with a dazed look on her face, Kasuya-kun came back to himself and raised his voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guuuuuuuuuuuuu!　KIMO-JIMA!　I&#8217;m going to kill you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He desperately tried to shake off the restraints, but of course, there was no way they would come off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san happily opened her mouth as he looked at him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And this outfit!　Do you get it? Wedding lingerie. Today, I, Misuzu, am breaking up with Jun-kun and officially becoming Fumi-kun&#8217;s property.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Kurosawa-san&#8217;s body moved up and down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nfu, I said it, I said it! Ah, it&#8217;s so good. This cock is really, really good, I can feel it, I&#8217;m being serious, I can feel it, now I don&#8217;t have to be patient and hold back, do I?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her speech was already doubtful. As soon as she finished her declaration, she started bouncing her hips vigorously, as if she had abandoned all feelings for Kasuya-kun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She bounced up and down, making a loud splashing sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Ah, Hiii, t-this is it&#8230; Jun-kun&#8217;s child penis can&#8217;t do this. It&#8217;s a grotesque piston. It&#8217;s so vulgar, I&#8217;m sure Fumi-kun will enjoy this&#8230;&#8230; The tip of his penis is hitting my back, and it&#8217;s making a lewd noise.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if Kurosawa-san couldn&#8217;t stop her excitement anymore, she started to say a lot of embarrassing words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnn, it&#8217;s good, Jun-kun, can you hear me? Fumi-kun and I are making love, the sound of my vagina sucking his cock&#8230;&#8230; Look at it, Fumi-kun&#8217;s cock is amazing, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop! No, no, no! Misuzu, Misuzu is not the kind of woman who would do something like that&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I coldly told Kasuya-kun, who was shaking his head frantically.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, who is that in front of you? Who&#8217;s the one sucking my cock so vulgarly and shaking her hips so hard?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn&#8217;t care about Kasuya-kun, who let out a rejected voice. Kurosawa-san bounced her hips more and more violently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Ah, Ahh, I love your big cock! Spread my pussy as wide as you can and I will accept it&#8230;&#8230; Ahhhhh!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san&#8217;s hips rose and fell like a machine, spraying copious amounts of love juice, which she displayed to her former lover in front of her. The innocent hue of the frilly sexy wedding lingerie she wore only added to the lewdness of the scene.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re so great, Kurosawa-san. You&#8217;re more energetic than usual.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumi-kun, you can call me Misuzu since I belong to you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll call you Misuzu. Can you tighten up the tip of my cock and squish it a little more..?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay…</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kosuru</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">,</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kosutchi</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, Nnn, Ah, Ahn, I&#8217;m going to squish it and have it spurt out inside my womb.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as he heard the word [womb] Kasuya-kun looked desperate and jumped up and down with a clatter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, don&#8217;t, don&#8217;t!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why not?　Today is a dangerous day.　Will you stick your dick in here and make me climax and get me pregnant? Can you do it with your little dick?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I can do it! I,I&#8217;ll do it&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Kasuya-kun said that, Kurosawa-san suddenly stopped moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she turned her cold eyes on him──</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A liar.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that was what she said. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While looking at the surprised Kasuya-kun, she began to move her hips violently again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no way you can do it, you can&#8217;t even reach me and you can&#8217;t even reach it. Ah, ah, it&#8217;s stuck in&#8230;..!　Fumi-kun&#8217;s big dick was in my womb, it was crushing me&#8230;&#8230;.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san then twisted her head to look back at me and sucked on my lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nchiyuu……muchu,jiyuru,rerorero, chiyup…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Puha, why are you kissing me all of a sudden? What&#8217;s wrong?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked her this while lightly pushing back her tongue, and she let out a slightly dissatisfied voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know why&#8230;&#8230;And I still don&#8217;t seem to understand, but I thought I&#8217;d better show him that I really, really, really like you, Fumi-kun, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Jyuuru, rerorero.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, you say cute things with your mouth, but your lower body seems to be trying to squeeze me very forcefully.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t it good? That&#8217;s not the same as begging for a cock. I want to have sex. I want to keep doing it with Fumi-kun all the time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasuya-kun was making some kind of loud noise, but it was nothing more than free noise to my ears. Kurosawa-san seemed to be the same way, staring at me with wet eyes, wiggling her hips and begging me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Jyuuu, Chu, Nchu…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We put our lips together again and devoured each other. And then I thrusted my hips up in response to her begging.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uhyinn?! Aa,aaa,yaann…if you suddenly play fiercely, I won&#8217;t be able to kiss you&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, stop it, please &#8230;&#8230; stop it already.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasuya-kun moaned in a hushed voice. Focusing on him, Kurosawa-san mercilessly increased her movement hips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, ah, how is it? This is sex&#8230;&#8230;yours, I don&#8217;t even know if it&#8217;s in or not, a lousy penis is not sex. Jun-kun, with that dick, sex is impossible even if you stand on your head. &#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was terrible. I couldn&#8217;t help but chuckle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the fact that it came out at this point probably means that it was Kurosawa-san&#8217;s true feelings that she had been suppressing until now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she continued to thrust further, she was probably already close to climaxing. She unconsciously started to pull her hips back. Of course, I had no intention of letting her go. I pushed harder and harder, as if I was chasing her withdrawn hips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hi, hiiiii!? N-nooo! Nhi, hi, i-it&#8217;s so good, it&#8217;s killing me, it&#8217;s killing me, if you do that again&#8230; it&#8217;s killing me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked, she responded, and then she asked for more and I pushed it up. The love juice dripping from between Kurosawa-san&#8217;s legs was already cloudy and bubbling like meringue.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I ask you again, who do you belong to, Misuzu?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I whispered in her ear, her body pulsed loudly inside and out, and her hole tightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m Fumi-kun&#8217;s thing! I&#8217;m leaving Jun-kun and having sex with Fumi-kun&#8217;s cock all the time! I&#8217;m happy, I&#8217;m looking forward to it, it&#8217;s the best sex I&#8217;ve ever had, I&#8217;m going to forget all about Jun-kun&#8217;s lousy sex, and I&#8217;m going to love your fat cock, I will love it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her vaginal flesh tightened around my cock and rubbed up against it even harder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wanted to cum! I want Fumi&#8217;s echi-juice so bad!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san was about to cum. Thinking this, I turned my eyes toward Kasuya-kun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way, this is&#8230;&#8230;a lie.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasuya-kun&#8217;s mutterings were no longer hanging in anyone&#8217;s ears. His expression was hopeless. The face of the pathetic abandoned man with scruffy cheeks was unbearable. I couldn&#8217;t take it. That sense of superiority was the final push.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Take it! Misuzu! I&#8217;m going to cum!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cum! Cum! Shoot it inside me! Please!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, my semen exploded all at once inside her.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Byururu, byururururu, byurururu! Burururu!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was probably due to the rush of emotions. A long ejaculation that I could not believe. It felt like a small-scale explosion inside me, releasing the cum that had built up and violating her womb.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahii, Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!? I-it&#8217;s cominggggg, what&#8217;s this, it feels so gooooooddd!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her body stiffened and her arms leaped to grasp the air. She was feeling it. Kurosawa-san was feeling it so much. She was tightening my meat pole tightly with eagerness, and I could tell how much she was pleasuring herself.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bikun, bikun</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. After pouring in every last drop, we leaned against each other as if we were running out of steam.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa…Haa…Haa…your cock is still erect even though it just cummed, and it&#8217;s sticking inside me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san smiled at me with a debauched smile. I playfully played with her flaccid body, rolling her hips and stirring the semen in her vagina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Iyaaan, don&#8217;t stir it, you&#8217;ll make me want to cum again…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said this sweetly, and then turned her attention toward Kasuya-kun, who was looking languidly at her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa&#8230;you’re still here?” </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was damaged&#8230;.He was still here. Even she knew that he couldn&#8217;t move on his own. In fact, women were more cruel and unforgiving when it came to this. It was the same with humans and wild animals. Females were more frightening.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, since you’re still here, be a witness to me and Fumi-kun&#8217;s vow of love. In sickness and in health, I, Misuzu, swear to love Fumi for the rest of my life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasuya-kun let out a groan with a despairing expression on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Kurosawa-san was still trying to push him over the edge. I guessed that was how dissatisfied he was, but it was complete overkill. Even I began to feel pity for him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaa..Fumi-kun, you’re amazing, I love you, my last boyfriend is a disaster, has the worst dick, a useless dick. I don&#8217;t want a dick like that, I want this one, and the proof is&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Buchi, botabotabota…….</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pulled her hips up and pulled out his meat stick, revealing a large amount of dripping semen and love juice to Kasuya-kun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaaannn…Fumi-kun&#8217;s love is so much in my vagina, I&#8217;m so happy&#8230;&#8230; Please don&#8217;t call me again&#8230;&#8230;Kasuya-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san no longer called him 『Jun-kun』. Perhaps realising this, Kasuya-kun looked at the ground and stopped moving.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was so pitiful that I had no words to say. While I was making an indescribable face, Lili opened her mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Lili will take Kasuya to his home, Devi. Just 『Quiet』 will do, right, Devi? It would be a waste if 『Forget Person』 made him forget about today, Devi.  We need to make it a memory for the rest of his life.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today was a memorable day for me. I finally accomplished my revenge against Kasuya-kun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was a bit curious as to what he would do after this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Lili asked that I should not use the 『Forget Person』 I somehow knew that she was planning to mess him up one more time and gave him another round of punishment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The devil, as they said, thought fast.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You are really the devil.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right Devi..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, there was no need to be afraid of Kasuya now. If he ever tried to mess with me or Kurosawa-san, that time I would push him down to the point where he could never disobey me again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, we’re going back, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I watched Lili and Kasuya-kun&#8217;s backs as Lili pushed the wheelchairs, Kurosawa-san gave a beaming smile with a hint of embarrassment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey…Fumi-kun, let&#8217;s resume&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
