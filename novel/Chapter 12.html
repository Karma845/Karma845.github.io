<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Getting Stronger quickly in the Labyrinth’s Underground! ②</h3>


<p>The forest outside of the Dragon Residence– An altar in an underground dungeon is located there.</p>

<p>In the woods.</p>
<p>Hidden by the bushes– there is an entrance to a grotto above the ground.</p>
<p>After descending down a gradual inclined slope, there, it is the first floor.</p>

<p>Continuing forward through a dark rocky tunnel</p>
<p>And you will arrive in front of an iron door.</p>

<p>And when you open the rusty red door, a monster appears.</p>



<p>–Minotaur.</p>
<p>The head of a cow, and the body of a bodybuilder.</p>
<p>Furthermore…… it is holding a ridiculously huge axe.</p>


<p>It is in a four metre cube room.</p>
<p>It’s abnormally narrow. As I stared at the monster and activated my skill, I swallowed my breath.</p>


<p>–Activate Skill: Physical Strengthening.</p>
<p>–Activate Skill: Body Strengthening Technique.</p>

<p>–Activate Skill: Kimonhou.</p>

<p>With this, I have the power equal to a veteran in a guild.</p>
<p>That is just a bit stronger than a 12 year old female Hero,  and the power to lightly slaughter hundreds of goblins.</p>



<p>— It is a ridiculously strong level of strength for a 12 year old human. But, among the dragons……. <del>its like a scrap of paper</del> it is too fragile.</p>



<p><em>Buon</em> (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eNy_ms_AIEI" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">*sfx</a> or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P_vnlMFQOEE" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this</a>)…… wind rose up in the room.</p>
<p>That is the sound of the minotaur swinging its axe at a speed unable to be seenby the naked eye.</p>

<p>The dungeon I’m trying to capture now is also a labyrinth as a ritual to become a full-fledged dragon.</p>
<p>In actuality, it is said that young dragons  die in this labyrinth at a consistent rate.</p>
<p>Foolish young dragons mostly die here because– they are too proud of their dragon scales leading to them ignoring their defense and inadvertently approach the minotaur.</p>
<p>In other words, the first strike of the damascus steel axe of the minotaur splitting the dragon’s armor is the cause of their death.</p>


<p>I reflexively evade the swing of the axe by a hair’s breadth.</p>


<p>–Honestly speaking, I was only able to evade with my intuition. Because, I cannot properly see the slash……</p>


<p>And again, before I’d noticed, the incoming slash created by the axe of the minotaur 1 metre before me was approaching.</p>


<p>Fast!</p>


<p>It’s almost impossible to continuously evading!</p>

<p>First, second, third, fourth, Fifth…… I evaded all the swings.</p>
<p>Sixth, Seventh, Eighth……After a swing downwards, a slash to the top– my speed has reflexively exceeded the limit.</p>

<p>And, I was hit.</p>



<p>—<em>Saku</em>.</p>
<p>A hateful sound came from in between my brows.</p>
<p>The vision of my right eye suddenly turned vermilion.</p>
<p><em>I was hit……</em> I went into a state of panic.</p>

<p>However, my body still moves.</p>

<p>Even though one side of my vision is obstructed, it’s only blood flowing into my eye…….</p>
<p>And the minotaur was…… having an relaxed expression as if it had defeated me.</p>
<p>As if saying that it had power to spare, it snorted and slowly raise its axe to swing it.</p>
<p><em>–Looking down on me……</em> it totally doesn’t think that I’ll counter attack…… actually, I suppose it looked down on me because I’m a human…… or in actuality, just a kid.</p>

<p>–It thinks that it itself is the absolute powerful…… an usurper?</p>

<p><em>No, that’s why…</em>… I smiled.</p>

<p>I pulled out a knife from my waist, and aimed for the cow bastard’s nose.</p>
<p>Only in that instant, the minotaur looked away as if saying that it could not believe I’ll counter attack.</p>

<p>「Don’t regret…… afterwards! Don’t look down on humans! 」(TN: equivalent of the idiom don’t cry over spilt milk; author used the word 人間様[ningen-sama], showing that mc thinks that humans on a higher standard)</p>

<p>–And the knife bounced off…… as if it was repelled like rubber — it could not pierce through the nose.</p>

<p>「I see. This is the test to become an adult dragon」</p>

<p>After saying that, I turned 180 degrees.</p>
<p>And I dashed full speed towards the door that I came in with.</p>

<p>「IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE IMPOSSIBLE!! This is definitely IMPOSSIBLE! 」[Muri muri muri muri!! Zettai muri darou konna no!] (tl: I had to!)</p>

<p>As expected……. a ritual in an underground dungeon to make a young one into a fine dragon.</p>

<p>It seems normal to have a rate of few tens of percentages of deaths by young dragons, so it’ll make at least 500 goblins yelp in fright……. This is not a place for a 12 year old Level 1 villager to visit.</p>

<p>I kicked the iron door open, closed the door behind me and took a deep breath.</p>

<p>The minotaur is like a gatekeeper of this labyrinth, also a sub-boss.</p>
<p>That’s why it will not come out from the boss room.</p>

<p>Therefore, if you went out of the room…… it will be safe.</p>

<p>I took a deep breath to calm my breathing.</p>

<p>While using Elementary Recovery Magic to cure the bruise, I spat out a revengeful「Shit!」.</p>

<p>I mean, for me, I was planning to visit this place only after a few more months.</p>

<p>Only after defeating goblins and orcs, raising my level to a safe margin……. then I planned to challenge this place prepared.</p>

<p>However, I cannot do that when I’m already here.</p>

<p>「…… What will you do? Turn back at this point? Honestly speaking, to challenge this underground labyrinth…… as a Level 1 villager…… is just reckless」</p>

<p>Carrying a rucksack full of water and food supplies– Lilith  looked at me with eyes worrying and said.</p>

<p>「It’s not like I can just do that」</p>

<p>「…… The strongest Level 1 villager. Certainly, you are one. It’s also true that you are out of the norm. And I understand that you are trying to help me. I am really happy」</p>

<p><em>However,</em> Lilith bit her lips.</p>

<p>「There is no need to risk your life. I should be at this rate exiled from the Dragon Residence, and sent back to the human world…… Brought to the master that had owned me and once again become a sex slave. In terms of that kind of situation…… I am already prepared」</p>

<p>Recovery magic had finally started to kick in.</p>
<p>Blood stopped flowing, and Lilith rolled the bandage.</p>

<p>She wiped my bloodied vision with a damp gauze.</p>

<p>「I will save you at the risk of my life. Don’t decide for yourself…… You will fall back into slavery if you go back」</p>

<p>「……That’s why, you don’t have to risk your life. You are just Level 1…… you can visit here again…… after gaining experience from lower level monsters」</p>

<p>「But if I follow that, I wouldn’t have enough time…… to look after you」</p>

<p>「…… That’s why you don’t have to risk your life」</p>

<p>There I gave a small laugh.</p>

<p>「This is just my…… obstinacy」</p>

<p>Lilith tilted her head curiously.</p>

<p>「Obstinacy?」</p>

<p>「Yes. If I throw Lilith aside now…… I don’t think I can make ‘that person’ smile」</p>

<p>「That person is……?」</p>

<p>「……  A childhood friend. This is…… something that I’m doing for self-satisfaction, this is really something that you don’t need to be concerned with」</p>

<p>And I turned my vision towards the iron door leading to the boss room for the minotaur.</p>

<p>「If frontal attack is not suitable/possible. In that case……. Oi, Lilith?」</p>

<p>「……What?」</p>

<p>「I have a request. Can you go back to the forest…… and prepare cut firewood?」</p>

<p>My rucksack is filled with survival equipment.</p>
<p>On the other hand, food and water is in Lilith’s rucksack, and my rucksack has survival items stuff like shovel and fire starter…… Well, things like those.</p>
<p>Then, I took out a small billhook and passed it to Lilith.</p>

<p>「Firewood? What for?」</p>

<p>I took out knife and thrust the blade into the soil wall near the door.</p>
<p>Thereupon, even though little, the wall crumpled and fell to the floor.</p>
<p>After I confirmed the fact, I nodded my head.</p>
<p>It seems that it is possible to dig the soil on the wall.</p>

<p>And, minotaurs are monsters summoned with summoning magic by the dragon tribe.</p>
<p>It should be easily understood to say that they are a type of familiar.</p>
<p>They have various restrictions put upon them, that cow bastard can definitely not escape from that room.</p>

<p>–Then…… if I have firewood, as expected…… it should be possible.</p>

<p>「– What? That is already been decided. To kill…… that cow bastard.」</p>





<p>–10 hours later.</p>

<p>A hole of a few centimetres– were filled with ignited firewood.</p>

<p>「…… Are you sane? How can a minotaur…….」</p>

<p>「Seriously serious, I’m dead serious」</p>


<p>For ten hours straight, the end of this firewood– towards the room, I’ve been constantly igniting the wood with Life Magic.</p>
<p>Therefore, the number of wood I’ve burnt has already reach hundreds, or even more than few thousands of them.</p>
<p>Currently in the room has……a shortage of oxygen.</p>
<p>In addition, it is also filled with dust and soot in there.</p>
<p>To matters worse, I…… used Life Magic even without oxygen…… with inexhaustible mana, forcibly continuing to keep the fire burning.</p>

<p>Bluntly speaking, inside is getting a big worsening.</p>

<p>However, Lilith can still not…… understand the situation inside fully.</p>

<p>「……I cannot fathom the minotaur can be….. exterminated just by doing this. I’m just…… burning firewood」</p>

<p>「Then, just sit back and watch. If it still doesn’t die with this…… I will give up.」</p>

<p>I shrugged my shoulders and opened the door.</p>
<p>At the same time I opened the door, hot air and black smoke came rushing out.</p>

<p>「…… This is?」</p>

<p>Peeking into the room, Lilith became speechless.</p>

<p>Of course that will be the case, the minotaur was struggling for breath, twitching.</p>
<p>I mean, that is still considered as living…… really, not shabby at all, this altar dungeon.</p>

<p>「Oi, Lilith? Don’t you know…… the phrase incomplete combustion(不完全燃焼[fukanzen nensho])?」</p>

<p>「……Fukanzennenshou?」</p>

<p>「I’ll change the way of saying it. Then, do you know what will happen if you keep on burning things in a closed room?」</p>

<p>「…… I don’t know」</p>

<p>「To put it simply…… poison is produced. So, this is what you call this poison that contaminates the body. Carbon monoxide poisoning」</p>

<p>「Issankantanso…… chuudoku?」</p>

<p>Even if I tell Lilith about suicide by inhaling carbon monoxide, it’s not like she understands it.</p>

<p>Anyways.</p>
<p>With a ‘fuck’ sign, I said towards the convulsing minotaur.</p>

<p>「Brains of a cow…… a mere livestock…… don’t look down upon humans who had conquered the Earth」</p>
