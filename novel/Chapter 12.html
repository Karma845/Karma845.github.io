<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Grandius</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Blonde
hair and swords dances in the swamp on the third level.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"GUMO!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Such
an attack would never hit me!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito,
the blond elf, brilliantly evades the troll's fist and slashes his side with
his sword as he moves past.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
it was not a fatal wound as the troll can regenerate.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Trolls
are more than two meters tall, and like orcs, they are protected by thick fat,
hard muscles, and bones that make them difficult to cut through with a sword.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
as an elf with level 1,500 and a powerful sword in his hand has made Kaito, a
powerful opponent.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">With
defensive capabilities that surpassed those of orcs and ogres and the ability
to regenerate, these trolls would normally require many adventurers fighting
together just to defeat them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Despite
this, Kaito continued to challenge the trolls alone.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"This
is the last one!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"GUMOOOOO!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
chopped off its head with his sword and then split the chopped off head into
four pieces in the air.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">No
matter how great the troll's regenerative ability is, it will die if it is
chopped up like this.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
wiped his sweat lightly and checked his status.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
still not rising....... Damn it!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">I'm
supposed to be the chosen one with the Master's blood flowing through my veins!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Why
......?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">After
entering a dungeon, he didn't return to the surface world but kept hunting and
killing monsters to raise his level.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
is staying inside the dungeon to raise his level, but there's another reason.
He has stolen the national treasure of the Elf Queen Kingdom, the sword
Grandius.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
a great sword that was used by "the Master" in the past.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Weapon
and armor are ranked from top to bottom:</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Genesis
class</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mythology
class</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Fantasy
class</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Epic
class</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Artifact</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Relic
class</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Rare
class</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Common
class</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
sword "Grandius" is the third fantasy class from the top and is a
very high-level sword in this world.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Currently,
the Elf Queen Kingdom is looking for Kaito. That's why he has chosen to hide in
this city. This city is ruled by the dwarves that fought the elves many times
for years.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
stole a treasured sword and is now being hunted by his own nation, but
honestly, he doesn't care.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
problem is--</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
impossible for a hero with the blood of "Master" like me to stuck at
level 1500! It can't be!"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
emotionally slammed the treasure sword "Grandius" into the ground
with one hand.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
corpse of the troll and the ground was sliced in two.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
am the youngest person ever allowed to join the white knight army, the
strongest in the Elf Queen Kingdom. I am a hero! But why.....?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
fact, Kaito's level has risen rapidly since he was a child, achieving excellent
grades in swordsmanship, horse riding, learning, tactics, and strategy. People
thought he would have a promising future.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
people around him praised him, and he had many supporters.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As a
result of his continuous success from a young age, he has become arrogant. He's
calling himself "<i class="calibre7">Boku-sama</i>"
and looking down on everyone else, even his own race. He continues to produce
results that silences everyone else.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As Kaito
mentioned, he was the youngest person to join the White Knights, the strongest
army in the Elf Queen Country, and was a top candidate for the next leader.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
Kaito's glory days ended suddenly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
level 1500, he reached his growth limit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
Knight Order's senior members, his peers, and other followers who had high
hopes for him disappeared like a wave and turned their backs on him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"He
was called as a candidate for the next leader, but his growth limit stuck at
level 1500."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
funny that he was only half as talented as the current leader, yet he is so
arrogant and got carried away.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I've
always hated that guy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I've
always disliked him. He's always looking down on me, and then he's always
talking about boring stories that make him feel good about himself."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
get it, I get it!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Besides, he has excessively high pride,
so if I point out even the slightest mistake, his face would turn red and get mad.
He would immediately start talking about how everyone else was less talented
than him. Seriously, he is the worst."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Is
that the best you can do? You're the one with the least talent, aren't
you?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Kaito
doesn't know, but there are a lot of people who don't like him. My colleagues
also..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Shut
up, shut up! Shut up! SHUUUT UP!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
voices he heard before he left his home are still haunting him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
took his hands off the "Grandius" sword stabbed in the ground, and
pressed his ears with both hands, but the voices didn't stop.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
the one with the most "Master"'s blood in my body! Just because I'm
stalling a little bit on the way up, everyone is turning their back on me! I'll
break through right away and prove that I'm not at my growth limit! I'm going
to make them admit that I'm the next leader, the hero candidate!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He shouted
out the anger, jealousy, resentment, and despair that swirled inside him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">His
scream was more intense and fierce than a wild beast, and it had a power that
raised fear.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
he believed if he gets a strong weapon and keeps hunting monsters, his level
will rise. He is not at his growth limit. It's just a bit of a standstill. He
believed that if he worked a little harder, he would be able to break through......</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
recently, no matter how many monsters he kills, he doesn't feel like he can
break through anymore.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I've
been trying to keep a low profile because it would be harder for them to track
me down, but I guess I can't keep doing that. Instead of monsters, I'm going to
switch to kill the humans."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">To
be precise, he would switch from killing monsters to killing humans, beastmen,
dragonmen, elves, dwarves, and demons.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">And
he had decided to focus on killing humans.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">During
his time as a knight, he overheard a rumor about an elf knight was struggling
with his growth limit.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">One
day, when a human slave misbehaved, the knight slashed the human slave to death.
The knight broke through his growth limit, and his level raised.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Not
just human, he heard this kind of story happen on beastman, dragonman, elf,
dwarf, and demon.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
since the elf knight had broken through his growth limit and increased his
level by killing a human, he decided to target the human race.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He's
going to kill anyone who gets in his way, even if they are from other races.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
human race is just a bunch of worms that will breed like flies if left alone.
Why is it a sin to kill them! In fact, they can serve as provisions for the
next leader candidate and the future hero. You should gladly offer your body to
me!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Oh,
I see ..." Kaito claps his hand.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"So
the race is a livestock race created by the goddess to be my stepping stone! No
wonder they're conveniently weak, easy to kill, and numerous like insects. I
see! Then there's no problem if I kill them!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito,
who had been suffering from hallucinations, turned around and smiled brightly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"For
the Goddess's sake, as the next hero and heroine, I'll kill the human race from
now on!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">The human race must die for the sake of
my future!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Hahahahaha! Hihihihihi!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Khihihihihihihihihihi!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">His
abnormal obsession shifted from the monsters to the human race.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito's
eyes changed to the color of madness, like a bright red moon.</span></p>
