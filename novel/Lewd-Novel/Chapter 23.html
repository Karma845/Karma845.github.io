<h3>Chapter 23: A Reward After The Fight</h3>

<p class="calibre5">Suzune's mother suddenly appeared, looking at Suzune and Shota alternately and tilting her head.</p><p class="calibre5">Well, I guess so. What kind of situation is this ......?</p><p class="calibre5">But Suzune's mother put that unusual daughter-son scene away with a single word, "Well ......" and then looked at my face.</p><p class="calibre5">And then.</p><p class="calibre5">"Ara ...... Konon-kun!"</p><p class="calibre5">And for some reason, she looked at me happily and ran toward me.</p><p class="calibre5">Also, I don't know what it is, but it's shaking great. ...... Well, I'm not saying anything about that .......</p><p class="calibre5">I was looking at her while the sight of Suzune's mother running toward me with her ample breasts shaking slightly stung my sexuality, and just before she reached me, she screamed and lost the balance of her body "Kya!" I screamed and lost the balance of my body. Apparently, she had caught her foot on Shota's corpse. She throws the supermarket bag down and dives at me.</p><p class="calibre5">I was unable to catch her in the sudden dive, and I fell backwards with Suzune and her mother.</p><p class="calibre5">Immediately afterwards, I felt a sharp pain in the back of my head and a soft touch on my face as if to soothe it.</p><p class="calibre5">Is this what you mean by "candy and whip"?　As I fell with such thoughts in my mind, my vision suddenly opened up.</p><p class="calibre5">"Goh, I'm sorry!　Konon-kun ...... are you okay?"</p><p class="calibre5">And before I knew it, Suzune's mother, who was riding on me, was looking at me worriedly.</p><p class="calibre5">No, no, why don't you worry about the fact that you kicked your own son's corpse instead of worrying about me?</p><p class="calibre5">Thinking this, I looked at Shota, but he was still sleeping with a peaceful face, so I stopped worrying about him.</p><p class="calibre5">And what a sight ...... whatever the hell it is.</p><p class="calibre5">I gasp at the chaotic scene in the center of the residential area. Me collapsed, Suzune's mother riding on horseback there, and furthermore, right beside her, the dead body of her son is lying there, and her sister is patting his head.</p><p class="calibre5">Oh my God, ...... there's too much information. ......</p><p class="calibre5">"Konon-kun, is there anywhere that hurts?"</p><p class="calibre5">And to Suzune's mother, who still worries about me while leaving her son's corpse unattended, she patted her chest in relief as she replied, "Yeah, I'm somehow okay."</p><p class="calibre5">Also, it's Suzune's mother. But could you please stop calling me by my pen name?　I have one dead body lying around who doesn't know what's going on. ...... Well, it's okay because he's dead. ......</p><p class="calibre5">But it seems that Suzune's mother doesn't care about that. She smiles and brings her face close to mine as she mounts me.</p><p class="calibre5">"Congratulations on your first place in the ranking, Konon-kun!</p><p class="calibre5">And Suzune's mother wiggles her hips as she congratulates me on my first place ranking, forgetting that she herself is still mounted on me. Oh, sh*t, I'm going to get a ...... trophy. ......</p><p class="calibre5">"I knew the readers liked the fact that you revised the whole story. But I guess the main reason is that you put out a cute mama modeled after me, right?"</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune's mother seems to have absolute confidence in the character she models.</p><p class="calibre5">"You can make me appear more often, can't you, Konon-kun?　Oh no, what am I talking about?　Am I a pervert to encourage my daughter's friends to imagine naughty things about me, hm?"</p><p class="calibre5">Yes, you are</p><p class="calibre5">I tsk tsk tsk in my mind.</p><p class="calibre5">"But, Nekonon-kun, don't let your guard down. You only win when you are ranked number one on the site. From this point on, you need to keep submitting good quality stories, or else you will soon be overtaken by your rivals. Konon-kun, if you are ever in need of ideas, please contact me. I'll lend you a pair of pants at least."</p><p class="calibre5">And then, there's Suzune's mother, who gives strangely accurate advice. What's with this lady ....... Maybe, but this lady reads more than just my works. ...... That fact further snatches at my proclivities. ......</p><p class="calibre5">But she immediately lost her balance and fell on her buttocks on my lower abdomen with another thud.</p><p class="calibre5">I let out a trophy from the unexpected shock to my lower abdomen. But she managed to stand up with her hands on my thighs, whereupon she finally turned her attention to the her son's corpse.</p><p class="calibre5">"Suzune-chan, why is Shota-chan sleeping there?"</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune's mother asked Suzune so, not realizing that she was also part of the perpetrator. Suzune looked up at her mother and smiled.</p><p class="calibre5">"Ah, um, uh, I'm just patting my poor brother right now!"</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune gives an explanation that seems to be an explanation but it's not an explanation at all. However, it seems that this information was enough for Suzune's mother. Suzune's mother's eyes twinkled and she said, "What a kind sister to pat her brother on the head.　Who gave birth to such a gentle girl?　Ah~Yes, that's me!!!" I said and crouched down beside Suzune and hugged her tightly.</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune's mother rubbed her cheek against Suzune's cheek. Suzune blushed a little embarrassed at her mother and said, "Umm, Mama...... it tickles me......."</p><p class="calibre5">What's this scene ...... I don't know, but I'm about to get another trophy .......</p><p class="calibre5">I stood up, my cheeks slightly tinted at the sudden yuri scene, and Suzune, noticing me, gently released her mother's body and stood up as well.</p><p class="calibre5">"S-Senpai, I-I'm sorry for putting my ...... brother through so much today. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">She bowed deeply to me as she said this.</p><p class="calibre5">"No, no need to apologize. I was worried about Shota too. Besides, in the end, my novels became popular thanks to Shota."</p><p class="calibre5">To be honest, he was a troublesome brother, but it was definitely thanks to Shota that my ranking was number one. I'll leave the purification of the room ransacking and underwear stealing to Suzune, but I have nothing more to complain to Shota about.</p><p class="calibre5">And there, Suzune walked up to me.</p><p class="calibre5">"S-Senpai ...... did a good job today. Please give me your head."</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune said so, and I did as she said and stuck my head out. Apparently, she was going to give me a good squeeze. I held my head out and waited for her to stroke me.</p><p class="calibre5">But what I felt wasn't ...... the touch of Suzune's hand.</p><p class="calibre5">"Nn......."</p><p class="calibre5">Suddenly, Suzune's face appeared in my field of vision. I was surprised by her perfect cuteness, which didn't change even after looking at her so closely, but what surprised me even more was the soft touch on my lips.</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune had her eyes closed and was pressing her lips against mine. I almost reflexively jerked away at the suddenness of it. But Suzune, who had her arms around my neck before I knew it, wouldn't allow it. She squeezed my arms tightly and pressed her lips against mine again, which had almost separated for a moment.</p><p class="calibre5">What a happy feeling.</p><p class="calibre5">I wanted to savor this feeling forever. However, Suzune slowly pulled her lips away from mine and turned her face away from me, perhaps embarrassed, with her cheeks flushed vermilion.</p><p class="calibre5">"H-How about a reward like this once in a while?"</p><p class="calibre5">She asked.</p><p class="calibre5">I was embarrassed by her words and turned my face away from her.</p><p class="calibre5">I don't know why. I've done many embarrassing things with Suzune that I wouldn't tell anyone. And yet ...... I felt a stirring in my heart that I had never felt before, even though it was a normal act between an extremely ordinary couple.</p><p class="calibre5">Me and Suzune were both silent in the aftermath of our first kiss.</p><p class="calibre5">But then...</p><p class="calibre5">An electronic beeping sound broke our silence, and Suzune and I both turned our heads toward the sound. Then, there was Suzune pointing her phone at me.</p><p class="calibre5">Hey!</p><p class="calibre5">"I did it! I took Suzune-chan's first time video!"</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune's mother was looking at the phone happily.</p><p class="calibre5">I mean, it was a video!</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune said to her mother's outrage, "Moo!　I'm really going to get angry!" Suzune's cheeks puffed out. But then, suddenly, she couldn't hold it in any longer and giggled.</p><p class="calibre5">Oh, what was that?　I'm trying to forcefully settle on something funny, but I feel like her mother is doing something totally dangerous. ......</p><p class="calibre5">I was thinking about it, but since I didn't have the courage to stand up to Suzune's mother, I decided to keep my mouth shut.</p><p class="calibre5">"Senpai!"</p><p class="calibre5">That's what I thought, but I didn't have the courage to stand up to Suzune, so I kept my mouth shut.</p><p class="calibre5">"Oh, oh ...... what's wrong?"</p><p class="calibre5">I was suddenly embarrassed to be called by the person I had just kissed. But Suzune smiled at me and said, "I'm going to continue to be my Senpai's friend...."</p><p class="calibre5">"I will do my best ...... to be useful for your novels from now on. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">She smiled gently.</p><p class="calibre5">***</p><p class="calibre5">That night. I received a comment on my novel "NTR my best friend's sister." It was written by "sho_littlesister_moe" who often gives me feedback on my works. He wrote in the comment section of my latest chapter, "I want to read more ...... scenes where she torment her brother more intensely."</p><p class="calibre5">I looked at his comment for a while and ...... closed it.</p>
