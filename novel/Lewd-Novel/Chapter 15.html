<h3>Chapter 15: The Overwhelming Feeling Of Last Boss......</h3>

<p class="calibre5">I realized today that I have never visited Shota's house, even though we have known each other for almost five years.</p><p class="calibre5">Well, I didn't care where we played, and I had no particular desire to go to Shota's house, so I had never been conscious of such a thing, but now that I think about it, I have certainly never been there.</p><p class="calibre5">As for why I'm talking about it, it goes back to recess after third period today.</p><p class="calibre5">"Ah, um ...... S-Senpai!"</p><p class="calibre5">I happened to pass Suzune on my way to the classroom, and she stopped me.</p><p class="calibre5">It was unusual for her to talk to me at school. As I turned around with this thought in mind, she rushed toward me with a music textbook clutched to her chest. Her Haruka-chan length skirt swayed with her steps.</p><p class="calibre5">As she comes up to me, she looks around once and puts her lips to my ear, as if she is concerned about the gazes of the students around her.</p><p class="calibre5">"S-Senpai, that story is ......."</p><p class="calibre5">Her breathless whisper like that made my eardrums tremble and I almost shuddered.</p><p class="calibre5">"What's wrong?"</p><p class="calibre5">"Well ...... that's ......."</p><p class="calibre5">She called me and then she said something there. She was whispering in my ear, so I couldn't see her expression, but I could tell from the trembling in her voice that her face must have been bright red.</p><p class="calibre5">So I braced myself.</p><p class="calibre5">Oh, Suzune. What on earth are you going to say in public?</p><p class="calibre5">"Hey, why don't you come to my house after school today ......?"</p><p class="calibre5">That's what she said.</p><p class="calibre5">Eh, what?　That's normal. ......</p><p class="calibre5">No, it's so normal, it's outrageous for Suzune to ask me to her house, but I was so prepared for "Umm, I'm ...... not wearing ...... today. ......" that I was out of sync .......</p><p class="calibre5">Apparently, I was invited to Suzune's house, and that's when I realized that this was my first time visiting her house, or Shota's house.</p><p class="calibre5">So after school, I met up with her at a park near her house, and we both headed to her house, but ...... I had a concern.</p><p class="calibre5">"Wouldn't it be bad if Shota found out?"</p><p class="calibre5">After all, it was that siscon b*stard. I was worried that Shota might find out. If he knew I visited her house, I wouldn't be surprised if he pushed me off the station platform tomorrow. ......</p><p class="calibre5">But Suzune giggles at my worry.</p><p class="calibre5">"Oh, don't worry ...... my brother is in prep school today, so he won't be home until tonight."</p><p class="calibre5">"I see. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">There seems to be no loose ends in that area.</p><p class="calibre5">And then she stops there.</p><p class="calibre5">"Here we are ......."</p><p class="calibre5">She pointed to a very ordinary house.</p><p class="calibre5">I wonder, did Shota live in a house like this?　As I looked up at the house with a vague recollection, Suzune opened the gate and beckoned me to come in, and I followed her.</p><p class="calibre5">She took out a key with a cat key ring on it from her bag and unlocked the door.</p><p class="calibre5">What appeared was the front door of a very ordinary house.</p><p class="calibre5">"I'm home. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">Saying that, Suzune enters the house.</p><p class="calibre5">Somehow ...... strangely nerve-wracking to enter a stranger's house. When I visited the house with a unique smell different from my own, I found a beautiful lady in a suit that I didn't recognize.</p><p class="calibre5">Who is this beautiful lady ......?</p><p class="calibre5">She was wearing earrings, but when she noticed my appearance, she tilted her head and said, "Ara?" She turned her head toward me and tilted her head.</p><p class="calibre5">"It's so unusual for Suzune-chan to bring a boy with her."</p><p class="calibre5">The lady smiles at me.</p><p class="calibre5">She is beautiful. ......</p><p class="calibre5">And her smile was too similar to Suzune's.</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune's ...... sister?</p><p class="calibre5">Hmm?　But wait, I've never heard of ...... Suzune ...... or rather Shota having an older sister, right?</p><p class="calibre5">"This is my Senpai that I told you before ......."</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune introduced me to her sister, leaving me tilting my head.</p><p class="calibre5">She tilted her head for a while, but then said, "Ah~!" and her eyes widened as if something had occurred to her.</p><p class="calibre5">"Could it be that you are Konon-sensei?"</p><p class="calibre5">"Huh?　O-Oh yes ......."</p><p class="calibre5">I answered quickly because she asked me so naturally.</p><p class="calibre5">Hmm?　Wait a minute ..... why does this person know my pen name ......?</p><p class="calibre5">How does he know my pen name?</p><p class="calibre5">"Hey, wait a minute!"</p><p class="calibre5">"Eh, what's wrong?　Is something wrong?"</p><p class="calibre5">No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.</p><p class="calibre5">Why?　Why does she know my name as a sensual novelist?! As I was making a pale face alone at the entrance, Suzune called me, "S-Senpai ......."</p><p class="calibre5">"S-Senpai ...... that's ...... I'm sorry ......."</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune bows deeply to me.</p><p class="calibre5">What?　What is this situation?</p><p class="calibre5">"A few days ago, I accidentally fell asleep on the sofa with my Senpai's novel displayed on the screen ...... and my mom saw my novel ....... I was so embarrassed that I made the excuse that it was my Senior's novel and I was reading it to support him. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">Oh, Suzune apologetically explains the situation.</p><p class="calibre5">I see...... and I was almost convinced. But then I noticed that her words contained an extraordinary word, and my eyes widened.</p><p class="calibre5">"Suzune-chan ...... just now, I heard you say mom......."</p><p class="calibre5">"Yes, yes I said ...... but ......."</p><p class="calibre5">Hey, hey, wait a minute, ...... you're lying, right?!!</p><p class="calibre5">I couldn't believe my eyes. Wait a minute ...... She is Suzune's mom?</p><p class="calibre5">I looked at the lady. The lady was still smiling and looking at me and Suzune alternately. The glamorous woman looked to be in her twenties, no matter what I saw.</p><p class="calibre5">"Suzune-chan, can I ask you something?"</p><p class="calibre5">"Yes, yes. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">"Suzune-chan, do you call your sister " mom"?"</p><p class="calibre5">"Umm, I ...... don't have an older sister ......"</p><p class="calibre5">"Well then ...... what is this person to you?"</p><p class="calibre5">"Well, she's my mother ...... but I don't know if you've met her ...... or not."</p><p class="calibre5">"No, no, we don't ...... but ......."</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune answered as if it was a matter of course.</p><p class="calibre5">Oh, no......I've had so much information since I entered this house that my mind can't keep up with it.......　</p><p class="calibre5">And there, Suzune's sister modification, Suzune-mother, giggles and walks up to me. Then, she put her hands on her knees in the hallway, a step higher than the front door, and stuck her face out and looked at me seriously.</p><p class="calibre5">"I've read your novel. Konon-sensei."</p><p class="calibre5">"Eh?　What?"</p><p class="calibre5">Oh, no, my brain can't keep up with .......</p><p class="calibre5">You, what do you mean you read it? You read my .......</p><p class="calibre5">"I can't believe that such a naive looking boy has such naughty fantasies in his head. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">Saying that, Suzune's mother poked my cheek with her fingertips.</p><p class="calibre5">Oh, no...... I'm going to get a perverted trophy.......</p><p class="calibre5">As I was about to ascend after such a motherly instinct dubbed peck attack from such an adult woman, she suddenly smiled wickedly.</p><p class="calibre5">"That Haruka-chan girl is ...... Suzune-chan, right?"</p><p class="calibre5">"Eh?　No, no ...... it's a ......."</p><p class="calibre5">No, there's no way I can answer that.</p><p class="calibre5">If I had the guts to say, "Yes, I'm writing a sensual novel using your daughter as a model," I'd be a much bigger man than I am.</p><p class="calibre5">"I'm sorry ...... should I die here and now?"</p><p class="calibre5">But when I declared suicide, Suzune's mother tilted her head.</p><p class="calibre5">"Why are you apologizing?"</p><p class="calibre5">"No, because ......"</p><p class="calibre5">I'm made your daughter and son incest in my novel.</p><p class="calibre5">"It's not like you're using her real name.　That's right. Suzune-chan is cute, isn't she? If I were a sensual novelist, Suzune-chan would be my first choice as a model."</p><p class="calibre5">"Haha ......"</p><p class="calibre5">What are you talking about, citing your own daughter?　What are you talking about, mother?</p><p class="calibre5">I couldn't keep my mouth open for Suzune's mother, whose perversity is even greater than Suzune's.</p><p class="calibre5">But Suzune's mother's verbal assaults do not end.</p><p class="calibre5">"Hey, how about using this aunt as a model for your next work?　You see, I have the air of an adulteress, don't I?　How about my daughter's homeroom teacher attacks mature women?　C'mon, c'mon. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">No, that's not funny at all, right?</p><p class="calibre5">No. ...... this is a bad one.</p><p class="calibre5">Maybe, I'm being verbally abused right now by this older lascivious or beautiful lady?</p><p class="calibre5">I'm about to get a lot of trophies. ......</p><p class="calibre5">I am completely speechless and can only break out in a cold sweat as Suzune's mother pats my head.</p><p class="calibre5">To her I think,</p><p class="calibre5">What is this overwhelming last boss feeling...</p><p class="calibre5">This person is the type of last boss who appears as a kind person in the beginning ...... and screws over the main character with overwhelming power at the very end. ......</p><p class="calibre5">And yet, you can be sure that this person is definitely Suzune's mother.</p><p class="calibre5">It seems that Suzune's perverted nature is inherited by this person.</p><p class="calibre5">She is completely Suzune's perverted supercompatriot. I haven't even met her for a few minutes yet, but I can tell ....... Maybe even Suzune can't stand up to this person.</p><p class="calibre5">"This Non-kun is surprisingly shy. He's cute. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">My body is completely stiffened by her and I can't move.</p><p class="calibre5">But then...</p><p class="calibre5">"M-Mama ...... don't tease Senpai too much ......."</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune said that to her as if to give me a helping hand. Then Suzune's mother huffed.</p><p class="calibre5">"Oh no, I should ...... have to go soon."</p><p class="calibre5">She looked at her watch and hurriedly put her feet into high heels and opened the door.</p><p class="calibre5">Thanks God .......</p><p class="calibre5">I finally patted my chest in relief to see her like that.&nbsp; As I watched her in amazement, she came up to me.</p><p class="calibre5">And then....</p><p class="calibre5">"Take care of Suzune-chan, okay?"</p><p class="calibre5">As she said that, she reached her hands toward me and, as if out of the blue, she put her arms around my neck and pulled me to her chest.</p><p class="calibre5">"Ngghh........"</p><p class="calibre5">Suddenly, I felt a soft touch on my cheek.</p><p class="calibre5">Hey, what a happy feeling ...... and ...... big .......</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune's mother patted my head while holding me close to her chest.</p><p class="calibre5">"Suzune-chan, she always talks about you to me. She must really like you. Konon-kun, you should love that girl a lot."</p><p class="calibre5">Oh, no...... I'm going to get trophies...... seriously, I'm going to get trophies, so give me a break.......</p><p class="calibre5">In the end, Suzune's mother hugged me for almost a minute as I cried, then left the house looking satisfied.</p><p class="calibre5">As I watched the door slam shut, I finally patted my chest and looked at Suzune.</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune was unusually miffed, her cheeks puffed out, and she was glaring at the door resentfully.</p><p class="calibre5">"Well, mama no baka ......."</p><p class="calibre5">Apparently, even with her perverted genius, she can't beat that rascal .......</p>
