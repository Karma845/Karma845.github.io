<h3>Chapter 10: A New Pervert Trophy!</h3>

<p>I'm sorry, teacher. I'm sorry father. I'm sorry mother. I'm having a pervert talk with the prettiest girl in school in the most intellectual space, the library. ......</p><p>The library after school, less than 30 minutes before closing time. She is right, there are no students who visit the library at this time. As a result, for almost another hour, this library was reserved for me and Suzune.</p><p>"Wow, I ...... might have misunderstood Haruka-chan so far. I thought Haruka-chan was a passive girl, kind of that ......M girl. ......"</p><p>Me and Suzune sitting facing each other across the reading table. In a library where we don't have to worry about anyone overhearing our conversation, Suzune is at full engine speed.</p><p>"But after reading it over and over again, I finally realized that I ....... Haruka-chan is indeed a ladylike and modest girl, but she has another Haruka-chan in her heart who is mischievous and aggressive ......."</p><p>Suzune's eyes sparkled brighter than any of hers I have ever seen. It was like all the love for my work that I had been suppressing exploded at once.</p><p>I'm happy. Of course I'm happy. No one in my life has ever read my work this deeply. And she reads my works and understands the heart of the heroine, Haruka, more deeply than I do. I don't know any great readers so far, at least not myself.</p><p>But you know ..... while I've been listening to Suzune's story seriously since a while ago, sometimes it crosses my mind.</p><p>(What are we doing in the library ......?)</p><p>I know. It's because my mind is evil. It's because I myself see sensual novels as something I want to be guilty of.</p><p>Look at Suzune's eyes. Ryutaro!</p><p>Have you ever seen such sparkling, innocent, and staring eyes?</p><p>Those are the eyes of a girl praying for world peace toward a shooting star on the night of Tanabata. Suzune has no evil feelings at all, she just genuinely hopes that my sensual novels will become more perverted and make many people feel dirty.</p><p>And yet you, you......!</p><p>The very first thing, I did was to ask her if she would be interested in the book, and she said yes.</p><p>"I'm sorry ...... I got a little too hot,....... What do you think of ......?"</p><p>She asks, as if deferring to me.</p><p>Let's be honest.</p><p>I didn't write this piece with that much thought in mind.</p><p>I'm wondering if there are any situations that would be perfect for a sensual novel.&#12288;Yes, Shota's sister is cute, isn't she? I thought it would be a good idea to have Shota and Suzune make love in a forbidden way, and then have the rodent take advantage of it to sleep with her.&#12288;I wrote ...... with that kind of flippant attitude.</p><p>But I'm too embarrassed to say so, even if I could. Let's put it in a cool way. I don't want to betray Suzune's feelings.</p><p>"Thanks for the advice. But to be honest, I don't think I have the confidence to write that. ......"</p><p>"That's not true. ...... When I read your novel, I kind of get emotionally involved with that ...... Haruka-chan, and I think your ability to express yourself is wonderful."</p><p>And Suzune genuinely admires my novels.</p><p>But I wasn't at all confident that I could write the kind of description Suzune was talking about.</p><p>"I'm embarrassed to talk about this, but I often think of scenes based on my wishful thinking. I'm not the kind of guy who enjoys being attacked by a girl..."</p><p>"Yes, you do?"</p><p>And that's when Suzune unusually interrupted me.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>"You have a propensity to enjoy being attacked by girls."</p><p>Suzune said that so clearly that I thought she could read my mind.</p><p>"Hey, why do you think so?"</p><p>"S-Senpai, do you remember what happened yesterday at the coffee shop?"</p><p>"Oh, I remember, but ......"</p><p>How could I forget? After all, the girl in front of me had told me nakedly about her own sexuality yesterday. I remember it so intensely that I cannot forget it even if I wanted to.</p><p>"Oh, do you also remember that time I fed anmitsu to Senpai?"</p><p>"Oh, that reminds me ......."</p><p>"Oh, that time, I deliberately left the spoon in Senpai's mouth for a while ......"</p><p>Ah, yes. I just remembered. Suzune put the spoon with the anmitsu on it in my mouth and didn't pull it out for a while. On the contrary, she was rotating the spoon in my mouth as if she was playing with the inside of my mouth. ......</p><p>"Wow, when I was rotating the spoon, Senpai looked that ...... little embarrassed. And when I ate the anmitsu straight from the spoon with my Senpai's saliva on it, you looked a little nervous. So I think that Senpai has a propensity to get excited when a girl plays a prank on him. ......"</p>

<p>"Well, that's the thing ......."</p><p>Her point was so spot on that I couldn't say anything back .......</p><p>Oh ...... I want to die .......</p><p>Geez, she can see through all of that. ......</p><p>"S-Senpai ......."</p><p>And there, Suzune calls me shyly.</p><p>"W-What is it ......?"</p><p>"Senpai, can I draw out more of your proclivities?"</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>I'm sorry, I don't understand what Suzune is saying at all.</p><p>When I was stunned, Suzune suddenly took out a pen case from her bag. Then, she opened the zipper and took out a ballpoint pen.</p><p>"Please watch this ballpoint pen. ......"</p><p>Saying that, she put the ballpoint pen in her hand on the table.</p><p>What the hell?&#12288;Am I being hypnotized?</p><p>Then, Suzune suddenly brushed the ballpoint pen away with her hand. Naturally, the ballpoint pen fell off the table and rolled around on the library floor. Then she looks at me and raises the corner of her mouth slightly.</p><p>"S-Senpai ...... please pick up the ballpoint pen."</p><p>"Eh, huh?"</p><p>"Senpai, could you please pick up the ballpoint pen?"</p><p>"Yeah, I don't mind. ......"</p><p>I couldn't understand the intention of Suzune's action. I stood up with a question mark in my head like a manga. Then, for some reason, Suzune also stood up.</p><p>I circled the table and approached Suzune, noticing that a ballpoint pen had fallen at her feet.</p><p>"Do you want me to pick this up?"</p><p>"Yes, please ......."</p><p>I don't understand. But here, I had no choice but to follow Suzune's lead. I crouched down at Suzune's feet, picked up the ballpoint pen, and looked up. That's when I noticed. I crouch down in front of her and look up to see her pleated uniform skirt in front of me. Her legs, covered with her fine skin, are stretching out from there.</p><p>I looked up further and looked at Suzune. She looked down at me as she squatted down, smiling her dainty smile, her most attractive feature. I offered her a ballpoint pen and she took it.</p><p>"Well done. Good job."</p><p>She said and touched my hair and patted my head with a smile on her face as if she were complimenting a child.</p><p>Oh ...... no.......</p><p>And then Suzune's cheeks flushed with a pout.</p><p>"S-Senpai ...... how did you feel about being praised like a child like this by a girl younger than you?"</p><p>"Well, it's ......"</p><p>"S-Senpai, you look a little happy, don't you?&#12288;If it were true, you would be angry if a younger girl did this to you, wouldn't you?&#12288;So why do you look so happy?"</p><p>Oh no...... my sexuality is completely managed by the girl in front of me.......</p><p>And then, there was a picone!&#12288;I heard a sound in my head.</p><p>I have acquired a new perverted trophy, "I enjoy being fondled by younger girls".</p><p>The moment those words appeared in my brain, I covered my face with my hands in embarrassment.</p>
