<h3>Chapter 22: It's Suzune-chan's Turn All The Way</h3>

<p class="calibre5">"I think you're a little too sore......."</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune-chan muttered with disdain as she stomped on Shota's head. ...... Her skirt is fluttering in the wind.</p><p class="calibre5">That is Suzune's dignified appearance that she could be mistaken for an ace striker before she hits a free kick.</p><p class="calibre5">I think, while calmly making an analogy.</p><p class="calibre5">Eh?　What kind of situation is this?　I don't understand why this is happening. ......</p><p class="calibre5">"S-Suzune...... what do you mean?"</p><p class="calibre5">Apparently, Shota is the same in that he doesn't understand the situation.</p><p class="calibre5">"Well, before that, don't you think you should thank me first?"</p><p class="calibre5">"Thanks?　I have no idea what you're talking about, you know?"</p><p class="calibre5">"Heh, I think you should thank me for stepping on my perverted brother."</p><p class="calibre5">With that, Suzune put her foot on Shota's cheek and rubbed her other cheek on the ground as if she was putting out a cigarette.</p><p class="calibre5">I finally understood two facts there. The first was that Suzune was angry. Her tone of voice was much lower than when she talks to him, and her eyes looked like she was looking at him like he was a piece of dirt.</p>

<p class="calibre5">And the second fact is that the sight of her slightly tugs at my proclivities.</p><p class="calibre5">I look at Shota with a feeling of envy as well as most of a feeling of pity.</p><p class="calibre5">Shota's face was bright red. His expression is a mixture of anger and upset, and I even feel a chill at the distorted look on his face.</p><p class="calibre5">"Suzune, if this is a bad joke, stop it now. If you don't stop it quickly, I won't show any mercy, no matter how many Suzune you are, okay?"</p><p class="calibre5">"Ho, you're actually in the habit of being happy. ...... You should be more honest. I'm sure you're really happy, aren't you? I'm not going to let you get away with it."</p><p class="calibre5">"Suzune, damn it!"</p><p class="calibre5">Even though Shota loves his sister, he seemed to have lost his patience with this. Shota put his hands on the ground and forcefully tried to lift up the head with her feet on it.</p><p class="calibre5">I was worried about Suzune when I saw her like that. The other party is a man. If Shota really wanted to do it, he would have no problem getting rid of Suzune's legs. And I wouldn't be surprised if Shota really wanted to raise his hand against Suzune.</p><p class="calibre5">So I tried to run to her to protect her.</p><p class="calibre5">But</p><p class="calibre5">"April 21."</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune, still looking at me with disdain, suddenly mentioned the date a few days ago.</p><p class="calibre5">"Eh, huh?"</p><p class="calibre5">Shota raised such a voice on my behalf. Both Shota and I rolled our eyes at her unintelligible words. But Suzune herself, still looking down at Shota with disdain, only uttered the words "April 21" again.</p><p class="calibre5">"Thank you for your hard work in revising all of the work. My sexuality is in serious trouble because of you, Sensei. I was supposed to want to bully my sister, but now I want to be bullied by her. Sensei, how will you take responsibility for this?　LOL ......"</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune says such a thing as nonchalantly as if she were chanting a spell.</p><p class="calibre5">But then I suddenly realized that the incantation she was chanting sounded familiar to me.</p><p class="calibre5">Wait a minute, this is ......!</p><p class="calibre5">"This is the impression Onii-chan wrote, right?"</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune said smoothly, as if her previous reserved language was a lie.</p><p class="calibre5">Yes, that's right. There is no doubt about it. That's the impression he wrote in my novel "NTR my best friend's sister." I remember it well because he was a reader who often gave me feedback. I'm sure the nickname was "sho_littlesister_moe."</p><p class="calibre5">Wait a minute, "sho_littlesister_moe"...... Sho Little Sister Moe?</p><p class="calibre5">You're lying...... please tell me it's not true!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</p><p class="calibre5">When Suzune asked that, Shota's movements, which until then had been desperately trying to lift his head, suddenly stopped.</p><p class="calibre5">For the first time in my life, I witnessed a person using magic.</p><p class="calibre5">Shota was petrified by the magic and I was petrified as a result of the shock of that fact.</p><p class="calibre5">Shota's face turned white with blood in an instant, as if he had really turned to stone, and immediately after that, it turned bright red.</p><p class="calibre5">Ah ...... this is a suicidal and embarrassing guy .......</p><p class="calibre5">But there is only one thing I can say to Shota.</p><p class="calibre5">Shota. Thank you for your continued patronage.</p><p class="calibre5">"O-Onii-chan, is it true that you don't lust after ...... your own sister?"</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune asked Shota in a cold voice. Shota's body trembled as if he was blatantly dismayed by those words. But Shota still forced a wry smile.</p><p class="calibre5">"Ah, did you ...... don't remember what I said earlier?　Even men who have younger sisters are sometimes exposed to works that are about younger sisters. ...... And yet, you're saying that's the only reason you lust after your sister?"</p><p class="calibre5">Shota stubbornly refuses to admit his lust for Suzune, using his perverted theoretical armament as a shield.</p><p class="calibre5">But I understand. I know that Shota is the true identity of "sho_littlesister_moe".</p><p class="calibre5">Shota...... you dug your own grave.</p><p class="calibre5">And Suzune also raised the corners of her mouth slightly as if to say she was waiting for those words.</p><p class="calibre5">"March 2nd."</p><p class="calibre5">The moment Suzune uttered that, Shota's tight smile returned to a straight face.</p><p class="calibre5">"Suzune ...... stop it!"</p><p class="calibre5">Shota pleaded, but it was too late.</p><p class="calibre5">"Konon-sensei, thank you for the update. It's a Sensei case. Because of your novel, I finally think of my sister and ...... I can't tell you from here. I'm waiting for your update. ...... heart mark."</p><p class="calibre5">"Nooooooo!!!!　Stop it, pleaseeeee!!!"</p><p class="calibre5">Shota's desperate cries echoed through the residential area.</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune opened her mouth to deliver a crushing blow to Shota.</p><p class="calibre5">"Onii-chan. What were you doing while thinking about me, hmm?"</p><p class="calibre5">No, Suzune. That's a complete overkill!　Anything more is simply kicking a corpse.</p><p class="calibre5">Shota was a shell of a man. His unfocused eyes were twitching and his mouth was gaping. Then, he barely uttered a word.</p><p class="calibre5">"S-Suzune ...... stop ...... please ......."</p><p class="calibre5">"Are you using me as a side dish, by any chance?　Onii-chan is really a pervert. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">But Suzune doesn't stop.</p><p class="calibre5">Is this really Suzune?</p><p class="calibre5">I couldn't believe my eyes. The Suzune I knew was indeed a pervert, but she was more reserved, and when she was in pervert mode, her cheeks were flushed and she was ashamed. But not now. Something seemed to be possessing Suzune, who was filled with anger.</p><p class="calibre5">And I knew what was possessing her.</p><p class="calibre5">It was Haruka-chan after I had made all the revisions. Her mind seemed to be possessed by the soul of Haruka-chan, whom I had created.</p><p class="calibre5">Then I realized.</p><p class="calibre5">It was a steel trophy above Shota's head. The trophy still existed. But before I knew it, the words inscribed on it had been rewritten.</p><p class="calibre5">[Pleased to be bullied by his sister].</p><p class="calibre5">When was that......?</p><p class="calibre5">I was astonished. Until then, I had felt a kind of pity for Shota. But no. That scene, which was nothing but a lifelong humiliation, wasn't a humiliation at all. And Suzune isn't tormenting Shota.</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune is rewarding her beloved brother.</p><p class="calibre5">In other words, Suzune's actions are not hurting anyone right now.</p><p class="calibre5">What a peaceful scene. ......</p><p class="calibre5">That is why Suzune doesn't stop shooting her mouth off. She won't stop shooting her mouth off for the sake of her beloved brother.</p><p class="calibre5">"Onii-chan, did you know that blood siblings aren't allowed to fall in love?　I don't know what kind of feelings you have for me, but I can't do anything naughty with you. Because you and I are siblings. It seems like you have feelings for me, but I would never have feelings for you. The thought of it gives me chills and makes me feel sick. But you do lust after me, don't you, Onii-chan? Onii-chan, I'm going to ask you one more time, okay?　How do you feel when I step on you now?　Are you embarrassed?　It's usually embarrassing to have your sexual proclivities exposed in front of your friends and to be trampled on like this, isn't it?　But now you look a little happy, don't you? But it's not your fault. You got your sexuality twisted by Konon-sensei's work, didn't you?　It's Konon-sensei's fault, right? That's why I decided. It's disgusting and gives me chills, but I'll allow Onii-chan to lust after me. I won't hate you. I'll allow you to do whatever naughty things you do to me in my head. You really want to kiss my shoes, don't you, Onii-chan?　You really want to raise your face, don't you?　Because if you raise your face now, you can see inside my skirt, right? It's just like in Konon-sensei's novels, peeking inside my skirt while being stepped on by your sister, isn't it? It's okay, if it's just once. I have to reward Onii-chan for taking care of me until now, don't I? Come on, why don't you hurry up and give me your face ......? I won't get mad, okay?　I think you're a pervert and I despise you, but I won't get angry at you. Or do you really want me to get angry? Or can't you believe a word I say? But think about it.　I've always forgiven you, haven't I? I never once got mad at you when you ransacked my room or when my underwear suddenly disappeared, right?　I knew about it all, but I kept quiet about it. So I forgive you this time too. I'll forgive you even if you are buzzing like a pig at my feet. Because in your head, you are free to do whatever you want. I won't get mad at you if you do anything in your room with that burned into your memory."</p><p class="calibre5">After saying that much, Suzune gently took her foot off Shota's head. Then, squatting down in front of Shota's head, Suzune smiled her usual gentle smile and started patting Shota's head.</p><p class="calibre5">"O-Onii-chan ...... what do you have to say?"</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune asked as she stroked his head, finally returning to her usual manner.</p><p class="calibre5">Shota to such a question.</p><p class="calibre5">"Suzune...... forgive me for being such a perverted brother......."</p><p class="calibre5">Shota muttered weakly and then he died. The face of the man was so peaceful that he looked as if he had lost all possession.</p><p class="calibre5">"Umm, I still love Onii-chan even if he is a pervert. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">There was the perverted onmyoji who was satisfied after dispelling the evil spirits from her brother's soul.</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune spoke so gently to her brother's corpse and turned to me.</p><p class="calibre5">"S-Senpai ...... thank you very much. Oh, it was thanks to Senpai's novel that saved my brother ......."</p><p class="calibre5">"No, no, no matter how you think about it, it was thanks to Suzune-chan."</p><p class="calibre5">"That's not true. If Senpai hadn't worked so hard, my ...... brother would have ...... still been trying to bind me. I just gave him one last push."</p><p class="calibre5">I don't think it was more than a push, though. ......</p><p class="calibre5">Well, yeah, at any rate, it seems that Suzune is no longer being relentlessly bound by Shota with this.</p><p class="calibre5">And then Suzune stood up. And when she was about to walk over to me....</p><p class="calibre5">"Ara? Suzune-chan and Shota-chan too......."</p><p class="calibre5">I heard such a voice, so I and Suzune turned our heads toward the voice at the same time.</p><p class="calibre5">Standing there was Suzune's mother with a shopping bag in her hand.</p>
