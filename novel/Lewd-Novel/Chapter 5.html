<h3>Chapter 5: The Shabby Girl</h3>

<p>"Last Sunday, I had to spend the whole day with her shopping and then dinner at a restaurant in the evening.&#12288;She probably thinks I'm her boyfriend or something. ......"</p><p>Yes, yes, he's talking about how happy he was to be able to pretend to be Suzune's boyfriend today.</p><p>Great, Shota, you went on a date with that Suzune. As your best friend, I envy you from the bottom of my heart. It's a realm that a dull high school student like me will never be able to reach. I can only fantasize about going on a date with Suzune and giggle at the best of my ability. Boohee!!! Boohee!!!</p><p>"Haa..."</p><p>Today, as usual, I'm going to school while listening to Shota bragging about his sister.</p><p>It's a bit of a circle and it's refreshing to hear him brag about his sister. So today, I decided to give him the reaction he would most likely enjoy. Of course, I won't say it out loud.</p><p>I was praising my best friend's boast in my heart, but in reality, I was too mentally exhausted to be doing such a thing.</p><p>For the past week, I have been unable to write a sensual novel.</p><p>Of course, the reason for this was the fact that Suzune had read my novel, or rather, that she had found out that my novel was modeled after hers. It's a terrible thing to say, but up until now I had been writing whatever I wanted, taking advantage of the fact that she had not found out about it. Sometimes, I let Suzune do extreme things that readers wanted, and I often borrowed her conversations with Shota.</p><p>Well, it was Suzune herself, whose nickname is "Suzu" (......), who wanted the most extreme content, but even Suzune wasn't sure that she was a model, at least until that day. Now that she knows that fact, she must be despising me. It's sexual harassment for me to proceed with a series of articles under such a condition. In fact, I haven't heard anything from "Suzu" since that day.</p><p>I haven't seen Suzune since that day too. Of course, since we go to the same high school, we sometimes pass each other in the hallway, but when Suzune's eyes meet mine, she turns red with embarassment and runs away, so I haven't had a good conversation with her.</p><p>It was only natural that she would do so. I had found out the secret that Suzune herself must have wanted to hide the most. I am sure that even Shota doesn't know this secret.</p><p>I was walking around in agony, leaving Shota to brag about Suzune endlessly.</p><p>And then...</p><p>"Onii-chan!"</p><p>I heard such a voice from behind me. When I heard that voice, I knew who it was and the blood drained from my face. I turned around and, as I had expected, there was Suzune.</p><p>Suzune walked up to me with a fresh smile that instantly lightened my heavy morning head, and took out a lunch box from her bag.</p><p>"Onii-chan, you forgot your lunch box. ...... I woke up early and made it, but it's terrible. ......"</p><p>Saying this, Suzune held out the lunch box to her brother, Shota. I've seen this scene tens of thousands of times. At first, I thought it was simply Shota forgetting, but after this long, I'm convinced that he's doing it on purpose to show off that he has Suzune who make his lunch box for him.</p><p>Shota grins. Really, this guy is not good at hiding his facial expressions.</p><p>I looked at Suzune as Shota accepted his bento with a sly grin that he deliberately couldn't hide. Immediately after, Suzune seemed to notice my gaze and made eye contact with me for a moment, but immediately after, she turned her gaze away from me with a blush on her cheeks.</p><p>"S-Senpai ...... good morning ......."</p><p>"O-Oh ...... good morning."</p><p>We both greet each other awkwardly.</p><p>Oh man, it's awkward. ...... After all, Suzune seemed to still have her tail between her legs. I and Suzune were silent for a while, sharing an awkward atmosphere, until Shota said, "What are you just standing there like that? Let's go." Suzune replied, "U-Un......," and followed behind Shota. And I also started walking with Suzune.</p><p>Shota is in the front, and Suzune and I walk a little behind him. I was curious about Suzune walking beside me and glanced at her, and she seemed to be glancing at me as well, and our eyes suddenly met and we both looked away, embarrassed.</p><p>We didn't start any particular conversation, and the awkward time continued. In contrast to Shota who was humming happily.</p><p>I wondered if she was still angry with me. Or does she despise me?</p><p>I couldn't guess what was going through Suzune's mind.</p><p>We just walked silently side by side. Then, Suzune-chan put her hand in the pocket of her blazer. As I casually watched Suzune, she took out a small piece of paper folded in two from her pocket.</p><p>Eh?</p><p>As I looked at it curiously, Suzune gently extended her hand holding the paper toward me.</p><p>And then...</p><p>Huh?</p><p>She unexpectedly slipped the paper into the pocket of my blazer. As I rolled my eyes at her sudden action, Suzune gave a small shake of her head and turned her gaze toward her brother, Shota.</p><p>Apparently, she was told me not to say anything.</p><p>At least, she wanted to tell me something without Shota finding out.</p><p>"Speaking of which, Suzune, are you free after school today?"</p><p>And that's when Shota suddenly turned around and looked at Suzune. Suzune looked a little surprised, "Eh?" And her eyes widened.</p><p>"What are you doing? Sleepwalking?&#12288;I asked if you were free after school today."</p><p>When Shota asked, she apologized, "Sorry ...... I have another appointment with Miyuki today ......." Hearing this, Shota looked a bit miffed for a moment, but since the other party was Miyuki, he agreed in a manner of speaking, "Well then, it can't be helped ......."</p><p>***</p><p>After school, I was at Tsukimoto Station, a small station three stops away from my home. After passing through the ticket gate, I found a small shopping street and a small coffee shop.</p><p>"There it is. ......"</p><p>The name of the store wasn't written, but I was sure that it was the nearest coffee shop to the station. I proceeded to the coffee shop.</p><p>This morning, I found a piece of paper in my pocket that was a letter from Suzune.</p><p>[Are you free after school today?&#12288;If you have time, I would like to talk with you at the coffee shop in front of Tsukimoto Station.]</p><p>Although it was well written, it was slightly rounded, and it was easy to tell that it was written by a girl. It's great that the handwriting alone makes you think she's cute.</p><p>It seems that Suzune's story about playing with Miyuki this morning was a lie to deceive Shota. I'm sure that the reason she went out of her way to specify Tsukimoto station was also to avoid being seen. I'm sure Shota wouldn't have forgiven me if I told him that we were going to meet alone. I took pity on Suzune, who was bound to me even though we were not a couple, and opened the door of the coffee shop.</p><p>I heard the sound of a bell ringing to announce my arrival.</p><p>Looking around the store, I saw a row of counter seats and tables, a typical scene of an old-fashioned coffee shop. At a table in the back of the store, I spotted a familiar face.</p><p>It was Suzune. When she noticed me, she still looked a little shy, her cheeks flushed with embarrassment, and she gave a small nod.</p><p>I wonder what on earth she's want to talking about. ......</p><p>To be honest, I have no idea why she called me out, and I've been in a cold sweat since a while ago.</p><p>"I'm sorry. Did I keep you waiting?"</p><p>I asked her and sat down in the chair, and she shook her head.</p><p>"No, I just arrived a few minutes ago."</p><p>Suzune smiles slightly as she says this.</p><p>Then, a first-aged man who seemed to be the master of this restaurant appeared with a cold drink and ordered a hot coffee.</p><p>"Aren't you going to getting scolded for meeting someone like me without telling Shota?"</p><p>Some of the students who attend our high school are people who live in Tsukimoto. Well, even if they did, no one would come into such a small coffee shop, but I'm a little worried.</p><p>Suzune chuckles at my question, "Ehehe ......."</p><p>"I'm sure my brother would be unhappy if he knew. After all, I'm refusing his invitation to meet with my Senpai ......."</p><p>"W-Well, you're right: ......."</p><p>It was easy to imagine Shota in a blatant mood.</p><p>The master came over with a tray of anmitsu. It was probably what Suzune ordered. When the anmitsu was placed on the table, Suzune's cheeks relaxed as she said, "Wow. ......."</p><p>"That's looks delicious."</p><p>"Actually, I used to live in this town when I was a little girl. My mother used to bring me here from time to time and feed me this anmitsu. I've loved this anmitsu ever since then, and I still come here sometimes to eat it."</p><p>Saying this, Suzune rescues the anmitsu and shiratama with a spoon and brings them to her mouth.</p><p>As I watch this scene, I regret a little that I should have ordered the same thing myself. But perhaps my feelings were reflected in my expression, Suzune suddenly looked at me and giggled.</p><p>"How about a sip, Senpai?"</p><p>"Eh?&#12288;But, that would reduce Suzune-chan's portion. ......"</p><p>"It's a little hard to eat when you stare at me enviously. Besides, I want my Senpai to know how delicious the anmitsu is here."</p><p>"Then, I'll take just a bite of it. ......"</p><p>As I replied, Suzune scooped the anmitsu and shiratama with a spoon again and held it out in front of my mouth.</p><p>Eh?&#12288;Could it be like she's going to give me an "ahhn"?</p><p>When I was upset by Suzune's behavior, which was a little too stimulating for a virgin boy, she giggled again, as if she thought It was funny. But she wouldn't retract her spoon.</p><p>I had no choice but to do it.</p><p>I put the spoon in my mouth with a slight sense of immorality, but with no intention.</p><p>Mmm, delicious .......</p><p>The sweetness of the anmitsu spreading in my mouth and the smooth texture of the white bean curd are just right for today's slightly warmer weather.</p><p>I wanted to express my opinion, but Suzune didn't take the spoon out of my mouth.</p><p>She rolled the handle of the spoon with her fingertips, giggling as usual, and the spoon spun around in my mouth.</p><p>It seemed to be a small prank by Suzune. In fact, she seemed to be enjoying watching me with a slightly troubled expression on her face.</p><p>The tip of the spoon she was moving hit my tongue and back teeth, giving me the strange illusion that Suzune was directly inserting her finger into my mouth.</p><p>After a few seconds of this, Suzune pulled out the spoon.</p><p>I was teased, and I glared at her lightly. Suzune smiled slightly and apologized, saying, "I'm sorry. ......."</p><p>What can I say, I was a little surprised that she had such a naughty heart.</p><p>At least, with her brother and Miyuki, Suzune seems to be a very ladylike girl who would never joke around. No, she is ladylike enough even now, but I somehow understood that Suzune today was a little less dressed up than usual, closer to her true self.</p><p>The spoon Suzune pulled out had a little bit of my saliva on it. It was natural because Suzune had rolled it around in my mouth. Even though I knew it was not my fault, I was a little embarrassed. However, Suzune didn't seem to be offended by my saliva, and she scooped up some of the anmitsu and put it in her mouth.</p><p>When I seeing Suzune like that, she was slightly shaken and tilted her head.</p><p>"What's wrong?"</p><p>"No, it's nothing. ......"</p><p>She answers, and once she does so, the conversation is cut short. Conversation ceased for a minute, during which time she dropped milk into the coffee brought by the master.</p><p>"To be honest, I was so embarrassed that if I had a hole, I would want to go in it. ......"</p><p>Suzune suddenly opens her mouth.</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>"I'm talking about Senpai's novel. ......"</p><p>"O-Oh ......."</p><p>And that's when I understood her words.</p><p>That's right. It's not only that I found out that she read sensual novels, which is embarrassing of course, but also the fact that is a novel with herself as a model being published all over the world. There aren't that many readers, though .......</p><p>"I don't expect you to forgive me, but ...... I'm sorry."</p><p>So I decided to apologize honestly. After apologizing, I was going to keep this in my mind and delete the novel.</p><p>But Suzune tilted her head at my apology.</p><p>"Why are you apologizing?"</p><p>"No, it's because ......."</p><p>I didn't think I needed to explain that.</p><p>But .......</p><p>"I'm not really mad at you. I was just embarrassed that my Senpai had found out my secret, and I was also afraid that ...... my Senpai would despise me. ......"</p><p>"I don't despise you."</p><p>"But I'm not the ladylike girl everyone thinks I am, you know?"</p><p>"That's why I don't despise you, Suzune-chan. In fact, I'd like to thank my readers for reading my work so much."</p><p>"............"</p><p>And there, the conversation was once interrupted. After a few seconds of silence, Suzune unexpectedly opened her mouth.</p><p>"Would you like to get to know the real me?"</p><p>"Eh?"</p><p>I couldn't understand what Suzune suddenly said. But her expression was very serious.</p><p>"I want Senpai to know about the real me. Can I tell Senpai everything about me that neither my brother nor Miyuki knows?"</p><p>"About Suzune-chan?&#12288;Is that okay?&#12288;You want talk about it to me?"</p><p>"Yes, I can only tell senpai. Because it was your novel that opened the key to my heart."</p><p>"............"</p><p>Saying that, Suzune began to talk.</p>
