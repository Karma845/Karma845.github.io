<h3>Chapter 12: Trophies Of Glory Go To Two Perverts</h3>

<p class="calibre5">[I am reading your work now while walking behind my brother. I am afraid that my brother will find out, but that makes it all the more thrilling and titillating. I'll send you more thoughts later].</p><p class="calibre5">That's what was written in the impression column under the name "Suzu." I looked up from my phone and looked at Suzune, and there she was, staring at the screen with her face bright red.</p><p class="calibre5">I knew she was reading .......</p><p class="calibre5">She was so engrossed in the screen of her phone that she didn't even notice my gaze. Her cheeks are still bright red, and she occasionally shakes her body with a jerk or lets out a nasty exhale, "Nn......." and, as if her mouth was lonely, she had been stroking her lower lip with her index finger constantly since a while ago.</p><p class="calibre5">There was a pervert in front of me who had put on the skin of a lady.</p><p class="calibre5">I was about to lose my mind when a beautiful girl read my novel right in front of me, and on top it off, she made my body tremble. ......</p><p class="calibre5">Then, Suzune continued reading the novel for a while. And unexpectedly, she let out a small breath, "Phew......," and put her phone away in her pocket as it was.</p><p class="calibre5">Oh, Suzune. Aren't you forgetting something important?</p><p class="calibre5">I had been looking at her with anxiety and anticipation, expecting her to write down her impressions as they were. However, Suzune put her phone away in her pocket without any sign of typing anything. I stared at the phone, but there was still no notification.</p><p class="calibre5">I looked at Suzune with clinging eyes.</p><p class="calibre5">She noticed my gaze and looked at me, and our eyes met for a moment, but then she looked away from me with a slightly embarrassed look on her face.</p><p class="calibre5">Seeing this, I was convinced.</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune is impatient with me. ......</p><p class="calibre5">She knows that I am eagerly awaiting her feedback, but she daresn't write it down. She was still breathing a little rough with her cheeks bright red.</p><p class="calibre5">In the end, until after school, my phone didn't display [Your novel has been commented on.]</p><p class="calibre5">***</p><p class="calibre5">After school, I came home in a shell of a state and lay down on the couch in the living room.</p><p class="calibre5">Heavy ...... perverted trophies are heavy .......</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune's impatience had a tremendous effect. As the first, second, and third hours progressed, the trophies got heavier and heavier.</p><p class="calibre5">I want to be praised...... I want to be patted on the head by Suzune while she says, "Good, good."......</p><p class="calibre5">Only that feeling was getting louder.</p><p class="calibre5">But, no matter how much I looked at my phone, there isn't any notification came in.</p><p class="calibre5">I'm going to give up today. Let's give up and at least have Haruka-chan stroke my head a lot in sensual novels. I changed my mind and opened my laptop.</p><p class="calibre5">But that's when it happened. A chime sounded in the room, announcing the presence of a visitor.</p><p class="calibre5">Who is it?　I stood up and walked over to the intercom. The moment I saw the person on the LCD screen, I was so surprised that my heart almost stopped.</p><p class="calibre5">"Suzune-chan!"</p><p class="calibre5">"Eh, is that voice ......S-Senpai?"</p><p class="calibre5">Why?　Why is Suzune-chan standing in front of my house?</p><p class="calibre5">"Did you have an appointment to play with Miyuki?　If it's Miyuki, she hasn't come home yet. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">When I asked that, the girl on the LCD shook her head.</p><p class="calibre5">"I-I came here today for ...... S-Senpai. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">***</p><p class="calibre5">A few minutes later, I knocked and entered my room to find Suzune waiting for me at the table, sitting on her haughty legs. Holding a tray, I placed the two cups of tea she had brought as a gift on the table and sat down in front of her.</p><p class="calibre5">Anyway .......</p><p class="calibre5">I wondered what Suzune had come all the way to my house to do .......</p><p class="calibre5">I looked at her. She was sitting face down, not making eye contact with me, twisting slightly, looking fidgety in some way.</p><p class="calibre5">Something erotic .......</p><p class="calibre5">I sipped the tea she gave me. The slightly sweet aroma of Earl Grey fills my mouth.</p><p class="calibre5">"The tea is delicious. Thanks."</p><p class="calibre5">When I thanked her, she replied in a hushed voice, "I'm so glad you're pleased. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">But a somewhat awkward atmosphere covered the room, and time passed as Suzune and I just sipped our tea.</p><p class="calibre5">I really wanted to ask her right away. I wanted to ask Suzune what she thought about my novel. But somehow, the air in the room was filled with a sense of uneasiness.</p><p class="calibre5">"How is the reputation of your novel ......?"</p><p class="calibre5">And then Suzune opened her mouth.&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre5">Every movement is erotic. ......</p><p class="calibre5">"Oh, thanks to you, I have more readers and for the first time I got on the ranking list. I can't find any words other than thanks to Suzune. Thank you."</p><p class="calibre5">In fact, my novels have been well-received thanks to Suzune's efforts to bring out my proclivities. Well, now I'm suffering from its side effects!</p><p class="calibre5">"I-I'm glad ...... but the fact that it became popular is only because of ...... Senpai. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">Suzune humbly denies her own achievements.</p><p class="calibre5">Seeing her like that, I lose my patience.</p><p class="calibre5">"So, if possible, I'd like to hear ...... Suzune's thoughts on it. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">That was the moment I asked her that. Suzune's body shook with a jerk. It was as if she was scared that I would ask her what she thought about the novel.</p><p class="calibre5">"Suzune-chan?"</p><p class="calibre5">"I-I'm sorry ...... the latest story is......."</p><p class="calibre5">"Was it interesting?"</p><p class="calibre5">"That's......."</p><p class="calibre5">For some reason, Suzune didn't answer my question clearly. As I tilted my head at her, she suddenly looked up. She looked at me with eyes that looked as if she was about to start crying.</p><p class="calibre5">"S-Senpai ...... do you want to be praised by me ......?"</p><p class="calibre5">"Yes ......."</p><p class="calibre5">I was unintentionally taken aback by Suzune, who suddenly asks a question that strikes at the very heart of the matter. In her eyes, it was as if she could see a perverted trophy on top of my head.</p><p class="calibre5">Upset, I smile awkwardly, trying to appear nonchalant.</p><p class="calibre5">"W-Well ...... it's nice to be praised by anyone."</p><p class="calibre5">"Well, it's not like that. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">"Eh?　What do you mean?"</p><p class="calibre5">"Well, you want to be patted on the head and praised while being told ...... that you're good, don't you?</p><p class="calibre5">"Well, that's ......"</p><p class="calibre5">Yeah, I'm totally exposed. My proclivities are completely transparent. Well, she's the one who released that proclivity herself. ......</p><p class="calibre5">"Umn, I ...... have been having weird dreams the past few days ......."</p><p class="calibre5">"Eh, dreams?"</p><p class="calibre5">"Oh, don't get mad, please listen to me...... My Senpai has been begging me to praise him and compliment him...... and I've been dreaming that I stroke his head... ..."</p><p class="calibre5">That's a strange coincidence. I've been having similar dreams lately.</p><p class="calibre5">"Umm, I ...... have been aching in my body to stroke my Senpai since I started having that dream. ...... I really want to stroke Senpai's head right now and praise him, S-Senpai ......."</p><p class="calibre5">That was when it happened. I saw something strange above her head.</p><p class="calibre5">It's a kinky trophy. ......</p><p class="calibre5">The trophy reads, "I enjoy feeding older boys." When I saw that, I understood.</p><p class="calibre5">I thought I had been unilaterally liberated from my sexuality by Suzune. But in fact, I was wrong. It seems that she herself, who had drawn out my proclivities, had also drawn out new proclivities.</p><p class="calibre5">"I-I want to stroke my Senpai ......"</p><p class="calibre5">Hmm?　But wait a minute ...... what are we holding back?</p><p class="calibre5">No, it's certainly embarrassing to ask Suzune to stroke me right in front of her face. But my interest and Suzune's interest are the same. If that is the case, we should satisfy each other's desire without forcing ourselves to endure. ......</p><p class="calibre5">I thought so, but Suzune shook her head, perhaps noticing my intentions.</p><p class="calibre5">"No, it's no good. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">"But, no, what ......?"</p><p class="calibre5">"I-I also have a desire to tease Senpai..."</p><p class="calibre5">"What ......?"</p><p class="calibre5">She was a cut above the rest. That day, I realized my latent perversity when Suzune released a pervert trophy from me. But while I was releasing one trophy, she was releasing two. If you look closely, you can see another trophy on top of her head.</p><p class="calibre5">[Pleasure in teasing an older boy].</p><p class="calibre5">That's what was written on the trophy.</p><p class="calibre5">No good. ...... She is too much of a pervert for me. ......</p><p class="calibre5">Apparently, she is caught between two desires.</p><p class="calibre5">"S-Senpai ..... why don't we do this?"</p><p class="calibre5">And then, Suzune suggests.</p><p class="calibre5">"Yes, please write one story for the series now ....... If Senpai writes an interesting story, then I will praise him. ...... I will pat him on the head and say, "Good, good. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">If I write an interesting story, then she will pat me on the head and say that .......</p><p class="calibre5">"S-Sorry for my selfish request ...... but ...... I can't stand it anymore. ......"</p><p class="calibre5">Thus, in order to get Suzune's nudge, I was to start writing a sensual novel in front of her, using her as a model.</p>
