<h3>Chapter 9: The Genius Pervert</h3>

<p>The breeze coming in through the window makes the curtains sway. Feeling a pleasant breeze that convinced me that this was the first day of spring in the year, I was transfixed by the literary girl sitting in front of me.</p><p>So beautiful .......</p><p>I was just reading a book in the library, but the fact that it was Suzune Minazuki made me feel as if I was looking at an impressionist painting. I am sure anyone would feel the same if they saw her. The sight of her reading a book is so attractive that if there were a hundred men, a hundred men would be attracted to her.</p><p>However, I know the words that can ruin such a heart-warming scene like a mountain stream.</p><p>[Student Council President's Training Memorandum Franz Shoin]</p><p>That is the title of the novel she is reading.</p><p>Oh, and by the way, the dummy cover is titled "Food Culture of Kazakhstan." Her collection wasn't enough for Southeast Asia alone, but had begun to extend its reach into Central Asia as well.</p><p>There was the image of Genghis Khan living in the modern age.</p><p>So much for the farce. ......</p><p>I was impressed beyond dismay as I looked at Suzune, who was reading in front of me.</p><p>How can she concentrate so well in the library? She has been reading for almost an hour now. Well, it's not my place to say this as I'm plotting a serial story on my phone, but at least there's only a window behind me and the library is on the third floor, so it's unlikely that anyone will be able to see me. But Suzune, who is sitting in front of me, is not. Behind her are the counter and the next table. In fact, several students have been passing behind her since a while ago, and it seems that they could peek in if they wanted to.</p><p>Oh, by the way, to my credit, I initially recommended Suzune to sit by the window, but she said to me, "I don't want to sit by the window. This side is more exciting......" and sat on that side.</p><p>According to her, she feels embarrassed when people pass by behind her and her heart starts pounding.</p><p>She is probably the most misuse of the word "kyun" in Japan.</p><p>When someone passes by behind her, she hurriedly buries her face in her open book and lets it pass.</p><p>Also, this is an aside, but sometimes she suddenly blushes or twists her head slightly, so that I can tell when she is approaching a scene of this kind.</p><p>In contrast to Suzune, who was engrossed in her novel, my plot had run into a deadlock.</p><p>It was only natural. The girl in front of me loved reading my novel. And she knows that the heroine is modeled after herself. In other words, if I write an extreme description here, it's like confessing to the girl in front of me that I have been messing her up like this in my brain. This is why I was unable to create a plot that I could go any further with.</p><p>I agonized over it while staring at my phone.</p><p>Then, the perverted literary girl in front of me suddenly put her library book on the table and walked to the counter. Then she spoke something to the student on reception duty, received something from the student, and returned to us.</p><p>"Is something wrong?"</p><p>"She seemed kind of tired, so I took over closing the door. I'll be here until closing time anyway."</p><p>I looked at the counter and the student picked up her bag, bowed to Suzune, and left the library.</p><p>That's when I noticed that there was no one in the library except me and Suzune.</p><p>"It's always like this at this time."</p><p>She replied as if she could see right through me.</p><p>"More importantly, Senpai ...... is there anything I can help you with?"</p><p>"Help?"</p><p>"I'm talking about your novel ......."</p><p>"Oh ......."</p><p>The perverted but kind-hearted Suzune seems to be worried about my novels being stagnant.</p><p>"Thank you. But I'm fine."</p><p>When I answered that, Suzune replied a little regretfully, "I see. ......." After that, Suzune put her index finger on her lips for a while as if thinking about something, "U~n......," but suddenly her eyes widened as if she was startled, and she looked at me while her cheeks turned bright red for some reason.</p><p>"Oh, that's ...... Senpai ......."</p><p>"W-What's wrong ......?"</p><p>"S-Senpai can look as much as you like, you know."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Suddenly, Suzune starts to say something I don't understand. When I ask her again, she shows her eyes as if she is about to start crying and says in a trembling voice.</p><p>"Umm, the model for that ...... Senpai's novel is me, right?"</p><p>"Yes, you are, but what about it?"</p><p>"So, so that's ...... if it will help Senpai's novel, you can stare at me with your ...... pervert eyes..."</p><p>"S-Suzune-chan!"</p><p>I involuntarily look around even though I know no one is there.</p><p>The beautiful girl in front of me says it's okay to look at her with erotic eyes. What a devilish temptation. Is there any man in the world who wouldn't succumb to this temptation? I seriously thought so.</p><p>And to my horror, her eyes were so clear that I could see nothing but pure emotion in them, as if she wanted to help me write my novel.</p><p>"Well, you don't have to worry about me. That ...... is a little embarrassing, but ...... if it can help my Senpai, I don't care where you look at it from."</p><p>"I'm ............."</p><p>No matter where you look at it, it's .......</p><p>No good. I can't seem to settle at all with guilt and manly romance punching each other in my mind.</p><p>It's certainly an attractive proposition for a man. But to look at her with an evil eye, with these completely unclouded eyes, is like putting a necklace of crosses bought from a suspicious foreigner in Harajuku around the neck of a Buddha statue. ......</p><p>"............"</p><p>"............"</p><p>And silence covers the library as I make neither decision.</p><p>Suzune was still looking at me single-mindedly with her clear eyes. And it was Suzune who broke the silence first.</p><p>"S-Senpai, you like legs, don't you?"</p><p>"What?!"</p><p>A dumb voice came out at a question so unexpected.</p><p>"Well, um, what are you talking about?"</p><p>"Umm, you know. ....... because I'm the biggest reader of Senpai's novels. Senpai's novels are full of descriptions of thighs coming out of schoolgirls' skirts."</p><p>Suzune's sudden point of view makes my face heat up.</p><p>"So, what do you think?&#12288;Senpai .......?"</p><p>"Well, that's ......."</p><p>In conclusion, Suzune's point is correct.</p><p>To be honest, I didn't intend to consciously draw the description of feet, but it seems that my proclivities were unconsciously projected into my novel.</p><p>"So, you like ...... girls' legs."</p><p>Suzune's eyes were convinced, and she smiled slightly, perhaps happy to have hit the target.</p><p>Kill me, please!!!!&#12288;Somebody, please kill me right now!!!!!</p><p>A sense of shame like I've never experienced in my entire life washes over me.</p><p>"Umm, I counted. I wanted to help my Senpai, so I went to ....... then, I found that the descriptions in my Senpai's novels were 3.14 times more descriptive about legs than breasts ......."</p><p>Hey, what the heck! That totally useless perverted Ï€ in your life!!!!</p><p>You're lying, right?! ...... How stoic can you be?! This girl .......</p><p>Suzune can see everything. She is surely reading my novels with her eyes plated. In it, she saw through my proclivities perfectly.</p><p>Don't be fooled by her appearance. Her perversity is far beyond my imagination.</p><p>It was as if I was rolling on her palm.</p><p>"............"</p><p>I was too embarrassed to even utter a sound.</p><p>And then, Suzune stands up. Her cheeks are still red, too. She must be straining herself. She must really be embarrassed. Of course she is. But she is trying to put her body on the line for my novel.</p><p>"I like it ...... girls' legs."</p><p>Saying that, Suzune fingered the hem of her knee-length skirt.</p><p>"So, how high should I lift my skirt?"</p><p>"No, that's ......."</p><p>I can't answer that!</p><p>"This much ...... because Haruka-chan's skirt is about this length."</p><p>Saying that, Suzune picked up her skirt by about 5 cm.</p><p>And that length is exactly the length of Haruka-chan's skirt that I had imagined.</p><p>"S-Senpai. Umm, I ...... I want to be Senpai's help. So, has this been able to help you?</p><p>Suzune seemed to have made up her mind.</p><p>She is willing to go to any trouble and any shame to read my novel.</p><p>This my best friend's sister in front of me might be a genius pervert. ......</p>
