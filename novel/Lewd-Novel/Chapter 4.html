<h3>Chapter 4: Stupid Sister, Stupid Misunderstanding</h3>

<p>With the intrusion of Miyuki, I couldn't have a complicated conversation with Suzune after all. I tried to enjoy the tea in a natural manner so as not to give Miyuki a false impression, but both Suzune and I were acting suspiciously from start to finish. The day was over ater we finished our tea.</p><p>"Thank you for today, Miyuki. And Senpai, I'm sorry to have bothered you today."</p><p>Suzune greeted me and Miyuki who came to the entrance to see her off. By that time, Suzune had finally regained her composure and was smiling like an angel, as usual.</p><p>She puts her foot in the loafer and stands on one leg, putting her finger in the heel. Her skirt fluttered slightly as she did so.</p><p>Just putting on the shoes is frightening because just by the fact that it is Suzune, the gesture feels like it could be used to describe her in a novel.</p><p>When she finished putting on her shoes, Suzune bowed politely to me once, then gave a small wave to Miyuki and said, "Bye," and left the our house.</p><p>I don't think I'll be able to continue writing serialized articles for a while at this rate. Mentally .......</p><p>"See you later!" Miyuki waved cheerfully at Suzune until the door closed, but the moment the door closed, she put her hand down and looked up at me.</p><p>"Onii-chan!"</p><p>When I responded to her somewhat agitated voice with a somewhat inorganic "What the ......," she puffed out her cheeks angrily.</p><p>"Onii-chan!&#12288;Explain what's going on!"</p><p>For a moment I was confused as to what was going on, but soon I realized the reason for her anger.</p><p>Oh no ...... I've been exposed .......</p><p>I'm sure Miyuki must have heard the conversation between me and Suzune when she came back to her room after making a pot of tea. Wait a minute. Isn't that bad?&#12288;If it was just me that writing a sensual novels, it's fine, but if it turns out that Suzune was reading it too, I can't complain even if Miyuki want to kills me.</p><p>"W-What do you mean by explanation ......?"</p><p>But I dare to cut off the white, knowing that it's obvious. Even if I was tortured, I would not open my mouth to protect Suzune's honor.</p><p>Miyuki stared at me silently for a while.</p><p>And then...</p><p>"Today Suzune-chan, was looking at Onii-chan with the eyes of the opposite sex. ...... I don't understand why. ......"</p><p>Miyuki tilted her head as she said this.</p><p>I, who had assumed that she had found out about the sensual novel, was somewhat taken aback by her unexpected words.</p><p>"Eh, what?&#12288;Eyes as if looking at the opposite sex?&#12288;What the hell is that?"</p><p>"I'm asking you because I don't understand it."</p><p>"No, opposites, in case you're wondering, I'm the opposite sex to Suzune-chan, you know. ......"</p><p>"That's not what I meant, today Suzune-chan was clearly looking at you as if she was looking at a boy she had a crush on."</p><p>"What?"</p><p>What was she going to say?</p><p>When in the world did Suzune look at me like that?</p><p>"I've known Suzune-chan for a long time, so I know. Today Suzune-chan was clearly aware of you as the opposite sex."</p><p>When she said that much, I had a hiccup.</p><p>It seems that the stupid sister in front of me is mistaken about something.</p><p>It is true that Suzune today was restless from beginning to an end, and she seemed to be looking at my face. But it wasn't because she had a liking for me. She was simply checking to see if I knew that she was reading sensual novels.</p><p>But I couldn't make such an excuse, even if I could talk about it.</p><p>"Well, you're mistaken, aren't you? Think about it. Why would Suzune-chan make eyes at a dull guy like me?"</p><p>"I don't know. ...... But I do know this. Suzune-chan had a woman's face today."</p><p>"What do you mean, a woman's face ......?"</p><p>"When did you and Suzune exchange contact information?"</p><p>"No, no, I didn't exchange contacts with Suzune-chan."</p><p>"So, you're sure it wasn't Onii-chan who was fidgeting and contacting Suzune-chan on her phone while baking?"</p><p>"Contacting while fidgeting?&#12288;It was ......."</p><p>"No, wait a minute. That's a misunderstanding, Miyuki! She wasn't fidgeting because contack with me. Suzune was fidgeting because she was writing her impressions of sensual novels!</p><p>I wanted to say that out loud. But of course, there was no way I could explain it, and on the contrary, my response, "Oh ......," confirmed her suspicions.</p><p>"You were actually secretly in touch with Suzune-chan, weren't you? I won't get angry, so please talk honestly to this Miyuki."</p><p>"No, I'm not......!"</p><p>"You're really bad at keeping secret. And Suzune-chan, when Onii-chan was eating cookies, she was fidgeting as well, glancing at Onii-chan, right?"</p><p>No, so that's because sensual novel. ......</p><p>Oh, no. I'm seething because I can't explain any of the truth!</p><p>"I knew it. Maybe she likes you, that Suzune-chan."</p><p>And there, for some reason, Miyuki said that with a happy smile on her face.</p><p>"Huh?&#12288;Suzune-chan?&#12288;That's not the case."</p><p>"Even I thought it was impossible until yesterday. But there's no doubt about this one. I see, that's why she was saying that she wanted Onii-chan to taste the cookies. ...... I'm convinced."</p><p>Miyuki happily agreed by herself.</p><p>It seems that schoolgirls seem to be very fond of this kind of story.</p><p>&nbsp;And then, Miyuki stretched out her neck and brought her face close to mine, smiling smugly.</p><p>"Onii-chan, how about I be your cupid?"</p><p>"That's none of your business! Besides, there's no way Suzune-chan would like me."</p><p>It's possible she despises me, though. But today's Miyuki is persistent. Shaking her head, she says, "No, that's not true. I'm sure it's a good chance," and she seems to intend to be a cupid.</p>

<p>"Onii-chan, think about it. The other party is Suzune-chan, right?&#12288;She's so cute that it wouldn't hurt anyone's eyes to look at her, but she has a crush on you!&#12288;This is the first and last chance in your life!"</p><p>"Aren't you casually belittling me?"</p><p>"Then, do you think that a more beautiful woman than Suzune-chan will like you in the future?"</p><p>"That's ......"</p><p>Damn!&#12288;I can't say it back!</p><p>"Onii-chan, I want Onii-chan to be happy as your sister, okay?&#12288;Suzune-chan is cute and has a good personality. I can assure you of that, as her best friend. I said I'll be your cupid with a girl like that, so what are you complaining about?"</p><p>Complaints?&#12288;There is no such thing. Of course, I would jump up and down if I could be friends with a girl as pretty as Suzune-chan. She's so beautiful that I would use her as a model for my sensual novels!&#12288;But, sister. You are mistaken. Suzune doesn't like me. She likes the sensual novels I write!</p><p>Hmm?&#12288;What am I saying?</p><p>"Anyway, Onii-chan. Think about it. Onii-chan don't worry, I'll take care of everything well. Oh, but be careful, don't let Shota-kun find out. If Shota-kun finds out that Suzune-chan and Onii-chan are dating, he might stab Onii-chan with a kitchen knife!"</p><p>"No, it's not a joke at all. ......"</p><p>If he knew that I let her cute sister read my sensual novels, no wonder he would grind me to powder with a millstone and erase every trace of me.</p><p>"That's why. Onii-chan, good luck!"</p><p>With that, Miyuki patted me on the back and disappeared straight into the living room.</p><p>I stood dumbfounded at the doorway.</p><p>Oh, I don't know what it is, but I feel like I'm getting into a lot of trouble .......</p><p>It seems that the sensual novel I started writing on my spur of the moment is about to take my life in a different direction. ......</p>
