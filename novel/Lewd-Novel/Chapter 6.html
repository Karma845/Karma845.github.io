<h3>Chapter 6: Pure And Innocent Pervert</h3>

<p>"Umm, I am not the innocent girl that my brother and Miyuki think I am. ......"</p><p>I'm sure these words were uttered with all the courage she could muster in her own way. Suzune's voice trembled slightly. And it must have been filled with emotion. Her voice unconsciously increased in volume.</p><p>"I am not the girl everyone thinks I am. I'm ...... I'm more of a nasty girl than everyone thinks I am!"</p><p>Her once-in-a-lifetime confession. She herself probably intended to tell only me about it. But her voice subconsciously turned into a scream. The word "dirty woman" echoed throughout the restaurant, and immediately afterward, the place fell silent. The old men around her, who seemed to be regulars, turned their heads to Suzune at once to see what was going on.</p><p>Even Suzune seemed to realize how loud her voice was, and her face turned red to a degree she had never seen before, and she turned her head down.</p>

<p>"Suzune-chan, let's calm down."</p>
<p>She gave a small nod when I said that. Then she took a deep breath once and leaned forward on the table, bringing her face close to mine and staring at me. This brought me and Suzune's faces closer together. It seems that she wants to have a secret conversation so that people around us can't hear her voice.</p><p>What is this cute face ......?</p><p>Suzune's face is irresistibly cute, even when seen up close. She has symmetry, with double eyelids of exactly the same shape on both sides, a slightly pointy nose, and lustrous skin. Suzune's face has no roughness in any way. She is so shy that her cheeks are dyed vermilion.</p>

<p>I feel like I'm going to get out of control. ......</p><p>I wanted to punch Shota in the face for no reason.</p><p>"And anyway, that ...... I'm a more ...... disgusting woman than my family and friends think ...... I am."</p><p>I almost shuddered when she whispered such a bold thing as if it were an exhale. They say that fact is stranger than fiction, but at least she was a few shades more glamorous than my fictional girlfriend.</p><p>But this is not the time to get excited by her words. She is talking about this very seriously. If that's the case, I must also answer her seriously.</p><p>"Well, to begin with ...... how did Suzune-chan come to read sensual novels?"</p><p>That was the biggest curiosity for me. I don't know how to say this, but the works I write are best described as adult versions of light novels aimed mainly at men. And yet, I couldn't help but wonder why Suzune, who seemed to have nothing to do with it, was reading it.</p><p>"Well, that's ......"</p><p>And then, the flush on Suzune's cheeks, which had once almost subsided, reappeared.</p><p>"No, no, you don't have to answer me. As for me, I'd be happy if you could just talk about what you want to talk about and feel a little more at ease."</p><p>But Suzune shakes her head.</p><p>"No, I came here today with the feeling of exposing my nakedness to my Senpai, and please listen to me."</p><p>I understand. I know. I know that was a figurative expression. But to be told something like that from such a breathtaking distance?&#12288;At least my pulse never seems to drop below 100.</p><p>"Umm, I started reading my Senpai's novels because of my ...... brother's influence ......."</p><p>"Huh?"</p><p>Her eyes widen involuntarily at those unexpected words.</p><p>"About half a year ago, when I wanted to wake up my brother who was sleeping on the sofa, I happened to look at his phone, and there was my Senpai's ......sensual novel displayed on it. ......"</p><p>"Oh, really ......?"</p><p>You've got to be kidding me!&#12288;I wanted to scream! Wait a minute, the shock is too big. If I have to say, it might be so big that I don't even care about Suzune who was reading my work. ......</p><p>Eh?&#12288;He's reading my novels?&#12288;No, no, no, I'm sorry, but I'm going to pull ...... the fact that I'm the author on the shelf.</p><p>In other words, I thought I was hiding it from Shota and his siblings and secretly writing a sensual novel modeled after them, but as it turns out, they were both my readers.</p><p>"At first, I couldn't accept the fact that my brother was reading such novels. Of course, I know he just enjoys them as stories. But I was still shocked and became afraid of my brother for a while. ......"</p><p>Is Shota really separating it as a story?&#12288;I am very suspicious about that, but it's not a good idea to break the story in a strange way, so I will keep quiet about it.</p><p>"At first, I couldn't understand why my brother read such novels. But from that day on, I couldn't stop thinking about the novel, and one day, when I was lying in bed, I searched for the title of the novel on a whim, and I found myself ......."</p><p>So, Suzune took a deep breath once. When she came to, she clenched her hands on the table tightly and forcefully.</p><p>"I-I found myself getting carried away too ...... and it was morning ......."</p><p>Should I be happy or pessimistic about this fact ......? My gut is in a knot of joy that she lost track of time and read my book, and pessimism that I may have twisted my best friend's and her sister's sexuality.</p><p>"I can't find words to say other than I'm sorry. ......"</p><p>"There is no need for you to apologize, Senpai. I'd rather thank you for bringing out my true feelings."</p><p>"Wait a minute, does that mean Suzune-chan..."</p><p>I had a bad feeling for a moment, but Suzune shook her head violently to the side as if to deny it.</p><p>"Ah, my brother is just my brother. I love him, but I have no romantic feelings for him."</p><p>"Hey, what the ...... oh, thank goodness ......."</p><p>"But because of Senpai's novel, I realized that I had been unconsciously suppressing my feelings. My Senpai's novels are very inspiring. Only while I am reading my Senpai's novels, I can release my suppressed emotions to the fullest."</p><p>"I'm glad you're grateful, but I don't know if I'm really allowed to be happy ......."</p><p>"At least I am grateful. Haruka-chan, as portrayed by my Senpai, is just like me. I really want to do something exciting like Haruka-chan too. But I can't do that, so I'm asking her to take my place."</p><p>Suzune's expression clouded a little as she spoke that much.</p><p>"So, but I was going to keep this feeling in my heart until I die. If anyone finds out about these feelings, I would be too embarrassed to live. ......"</p><p>"Buy, you're exposing it to me. ......"</p><p>She nodded.</p><p>"It's completely my careless mistake. I read it the night before and fell asleep and left the house with the screen of the novel open. ......"</p><p>I see, I understand everything that happened. Suzune must have been quite prepared to tell me. If it were true, I would have been too scared to talk about such a thing to the opposite sex.</p><p>"Did you become disillusioned with me like this, Senpai?"</p><p>Suzune fearfully asked me such a thing.</p><p>Perhaps it is inappropriate, but I can't thank the girl in front of me enough for stirring up my emotions so much for my novel. She may think her feelings are impure, but I am sure her heart is pure to the core.</p><p>"I thought Suzune-chan was a lady to the end of the line and a neat and clean girl."</p><p>After saying that much, Suzune's eyes widen in surprise. She must have thought I was disillusioned. But please hear me out.</p><p>"But ...... but I'm sure my imagination was right."</p><p>"Am I right?&#12288;I'm such a--"</p><p>"Maybe Suzune's feelings are normal. I'm the same way. Adolescent boys and girls are such creatures. I think Suzune-chan who worries about it so seriously is a pure and innocent girl to the end."</p><p>But Shota. I won't forgive you.</p><p>Suzune stared at me without being able to say anything back to those words. We must have been staring at each other for only a few seconds. But it felt like an infinite amount of time. Then, unexpectedly, Suzune let out a giggle as if she could no longer hold back her laughter.</p><p>"Suzune-chan?"</p><p>"I'm sorry. But I'm still glad that I confided everything to my Senpai. It's okay to be more honest, isn't it? Just knowing that makes me feel better."</p><p>To be honest, I don't think I was able to give that much accurate advice. But Suzune's smile was natural. And an innocent smile that was unblemished to no end.</p><p>"I am a coward, so I don't have the courage to confide these feelings to my brother and Miyuki. But I won't hide it anymore, especially from Senpai. I won't hide the fact that I'm that kind of girl in front of Senpai."</p><p>Suzune says this with a radiant face.</p><p>Hm?&#12288;Wait a minute. Isn't she just saying something outrageous ...... without hesitation?</p><p>"So, that's why Senpai also ......."</p><p>But then, unexpectedly, Suzune's cheeks blush again. She really is a girl whose complexion changes like a traffic light.</p><p>"Well, Senpai, please don't worry about me ...... and please continue writing."</p><p>And then the topic turns to me.</p><p>"You've stopped writing for me because you're concerned about me, haven't you?"</p><p>"Eh?&#12288;Well, yeah, ...... as expected, it's not something I'm going to write until I offend Suzune-chan. ......"</p><p>Suzune shook her head.</p><p>"I love Senpai's novels. I want to read more and more of Senpai's novels in the future."</p><p>"So, but is that okay?&#12288;The heroine's model is Suzune-chan, right?"</p><p>"It's okay. I'm okay with it. I don't care how much dirt you put on me in your novel."</p><p>"O-Oh ...... thank you ......."</p><p>I don't know what to say back to her when she says that with such straight eyes. ......</p><p>Looking into her straight eyes, I thought to myself. Maybe I'm stepping into a terrible situation?</p><p>Shota. Your sister, to put it mildly, is a pervert.</p><p>I bet she's a pure and innocent pervert. ......</p>
