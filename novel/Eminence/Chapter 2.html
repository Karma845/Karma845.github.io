<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 2: The Girl Beside</b></h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 1</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once a month, the student council and representatives from each committee have a meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The content of the meeting is instructions from the student council and reports on the activities of the respective committees, and there is rarely any contentious discussion. It’s very practical and straightforward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We are having that meeting today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as one might know, I’m the only member of the library committee this year. Therefore, it’s naturally me who will participate in the meeting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After classes, I first went to the faculty as usual and borrowed the key to the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I headed to the library, and upon entering, I took out the &#8220;Closed Today&#8221; paper that I had prepared and put it on the door of the entrance. Similarly, the paper announcing that the library was closed today had been posted on the counter for about a week, so none of the regulars showed up while I was doing this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After that, I head for the conference room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was walking down the hallway, someone approached from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around and saw a 12th grade female student with tawny eyes and a gentle demeanor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Takajou Miyabi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good afternoon, Takajou-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Meeting for the committee?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai approaches and asks me as we stand side by side. I slowed down my pace a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes… Huh? Are you also going to the meeting? But I haven’t seen you go before.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was only in April that I became the only member of the library committee after the school year started, but that was only on paper. In fact, I had been attending meetings as a representative since the fall of last school year, when the 12th grade students were busy with entrance exams.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that time, every committee had an acting representative, but many of them seem to have become representatives as they were the year prior, so the lineup has not changed much. I don&#8217;t know which committee Takajou-senpai is on, but I haven’t seen her participate last year and this year.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew you were going to represent the library committee, so this time I asked Lopros to―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lopros?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Our chairman.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Usually, for a committee, you would call them &#8216;chief&#8217;.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told the chief and asked him to let me take his place. I wanted to see you, Makabe-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is it fine to replace him for such a reason?… Well, I guess Chief Lopros thought it was too much of a pain to have a meeting, so I guess he just said yes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I would usually be in the library after school though… By the way, what committee are you in, Takajou-senpai?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Public Morals Committee.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bfuu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I involuntarily choked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Judging from that reaction, did you hear something from Takinami-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I did…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to what I have heard, Takajou-senpai uploads explicit selfies on social networking sites, without showing her face. In other words, she’s the person you would last expect to be in the Public Morals Committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Revealing other people’s secrets, this calls for a punishment for Takinami-san. I’ll send explicit selfies to Makabe-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please don’t do that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t think she would happily send one to me, but just in case.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was the one who asked her. Takinami-senpai was just answering the question. She&#8217;s not to blame.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In addition, if Takajou-senpai had not implied that she had such an account, there would have been no such talk between me and Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was just kidding.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai chuckles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m more interested in Takinami-san, who decided that it was okay to tell you. Is Takinami-san really interested in you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who knows? Ask the person herself. That said, I don’t think she would be interested in an ordinary person like me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered her question while implying that I’m just her underclassman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think you’re not half bad, Makabe-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, why were you doing those things? A hobby?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked her a question in order to change the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s see. I guess it’s a hobby. There are many cute uniforms overseas. But more than that, it&#8217;s a stress reliever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stress reliever?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have a reasonably respectable family, and I was taught very strictly ever since I was a child. So I think it&#8217;s a reaction to that. A sense of liberation, or a need for approval.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai dispassionately stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. She’s able to analyze herself. This person must be able to look at herself objectively. As if to show that fact, her teasing tone has gone down a bit.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Some of the people I&#8217;m close to know about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m worried. Some may even be pretending to be friendly and reveal it behind her back, or they might have a fight… but I dropped that thought since her friends are also Takinami-senpai&#8217;s friends. I saw them several times, but since the center of the group was Takinami Ruika, it seemed unlikely that they would be chatting amiably at the table but kicking each other&#8217;s legs underneath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They told me to stop doing it. Takinami-san also told me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I bet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Any respectable friend would advise you to do so. After all, she’s doing something quite dangerous. If someone with malicious intent were to trace it back to Takajou-senpai, it would result in a bad situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can’t stop doing it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rather, I don’t want to.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai stated it clearly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At first, it was just curiosity. Then, stress led me to really get into it, and now it&#8217;s a hobby. I don&#8217;t want to deny it, because I made this decision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was all I could say to Takajou-senpai, who seemed to be talking about something important.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, this person knows herself well. Maybe this is a kind of sincerity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand. I’m also afraid of being exposed. Thanks to that, I have acquired a lot of knowledge. I&#8217;ve learned so much that I could start an IT company right away.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that is true, it would be totally unimaginable from her gentle atmosphere. Appearance is indeed deceiving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All things considered, this is the first time a boy found out about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Since it would be a disaster if they ask me to wear this or ask to take a picture.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai chuckles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before I knew it, she’s expressing her troubles, and the air felt a little heavy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought of the same thing too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not even you, Makabe-kun. We don&#8217;t do photo sessions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I let out a joke in a light tone, Takajou-senpai laughed in return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gentle atmosphere returns.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, but if it’s you, it’s fine.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, her calm tone of voice exuded a strange sexual appeal.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/tZynNT2/00013.jpg" alt="00013" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about me for your cheating partner? I&#8217;ll give you an after-school date in your favorite uniform.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oops, I can see the conference room. Everybody might be waiting, let’s hurry.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickened my pace to slip out of her grasp. Behind me, Takajou-senpai was saying, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Oh, come on!”</span></i></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope you will not suggest such a thing to me. It would be a bloodbath.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The meeting lasted for about an hour as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the meeting, I just reported on the activities of the library committee. Since I only open the library after school, there was not much to report. When I finished, a 12th grader said to me, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry that you&#8217;re all alone. But you&#8217;ve been really helpful, so I would like to thank you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for the content of the meeting, in my case, it&#8217;s easy because I don&#8217;t have any committee members to share information with.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The notice that the library will be closed a few days ago seems to have spread, so no one is likely to come to the library if I open it now. I decided to leave without trying to open the library today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I returned home earlier than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I got off the train at the Myodani station and exited the ticket gate, I became concerned about one thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I do not have a key to the Hasumi residence. If Hasumi-senpai locks the house thinking I will be back at the usual time, I won’t be able to enter the house and will be locked out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hope she didn&#8217;t go out―as I was thinking about that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shi…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, such a short sound jumped into my ears. Even with just this, I know whose voice this is as I have become completely accustomed to hearing it over the past half month or so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my head in the voice’s direction and saw Hasumi-senpai peering around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems she saw me and tried to call me by name just as she did at home, but she remembered she’s still in front of the station, where she doesn&#8217;t know who could be watching, so she called me again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, what&#8217;s wrong? Aren&#8217;t you earlier than usual?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai came up to me and asked. This time by my given name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s now wearing long denim pants and a short-sleeved shirt with a cut-and-sew design. She’s also carrying a large eco-bag in her hand, so it seems that she went home once and went out again to buy something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I had a committee meeting today. After that, I didn&#8217;t open the library, so I just went home.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I answered, I took the bag from Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-thanks… I see. I didn’t realize that committees do that too. But good thing we met here.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry. I should have said so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s only natural that students not involved in the committee would not know that we have such a meeting once a month. I could have avoided this situation by simply saying something in advance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, with my school bag and eco-bag, and Hasumi-senpai, empty-handed, walked side by side in silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I know it&#8217;s late, but I&#8217;ll give you the keys when we get back. Keep it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai eventually said a few words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it okay?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay or not, how can a family not have a key to the house? If no one is there, you would be locked out. I can&#8217;t be there every time you come over.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her back, she wound up speaking rather quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it was a reaction to the embarrassment of having to go through this stuff. I could only say, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;I see…”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and we walked home together in silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When the bustle in front of the station was getting farther and farther away, Hasumi suddenly opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When Dad tried to give you the key, you didn&#8217;t accept it because I made an ill face, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was sure that Hasumi-senpai had a complicated look on her face at that time, although not quite much. Was she aware of it, or did she realize it later?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, no one would want to leave the key to their house with a complete stranger.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s no point in hiding it, so I answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re also being considerate of other things too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s the same for you, Hasumi-senpai. Since two strangers are going to live together, it&#8217;s bound to happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai chuckles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even for her, there are probably times when she feels inconvenienced in some way. Even when she acts the same as usual, and so </span><span style="font-weight: 400">I should do the same</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, well, you’re not an unknown person or a stranger anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai spun her words in such a way that it seems somewhat difficult to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lost my mom in an accident and was left alone, so I’m grateful for those words. It makes my heart warm a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since you came home early, why not help me prepare dinner? Dad will also be there for dinner, so the three of us will eat together.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps embarrassed, Hasumi-senpai turned around and ordered me in a manner that seemed condescending.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, with pleasure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s my dear sister&#8217;s request. I have no choice but to accept.</span></p>

<h3 
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And therefore, I was given the key to the house.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day, in the library after school, I told Takinami Ruika about a small incident that occurred yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a few minutes ago, the pre-bell rang five minutes before the main bell. I’m at the counter, getting ready to close the library. Looking at the reading section, I see that the students who had stayed until this time are leaving one by one. I was glad to see that almost all the students had left by the time the room was about to close.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And standing right in front of the counter, blocking my view, was Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess this means I’m being acknowledged as family, more or less.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckle, but I can&#8217;t help but be self-deprecating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I’m a child of a mistress. Even though we are half-related, it must have been difficult for Hasumi-senpai to accept me. The fact that our relationship is getting better despite such a negative starting point is probably due to her friendly personality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t that the case from the beginning?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai&#8217;s words convinced me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, Hasumi-senpai had a fine line between Uncle’s mistake and me. She also made it clear that I was only born and didn’t do anything wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, whether she could accept me as her half-brother, who she met for the first time, as family would be another story. In fact, Hasumi-senpai seemed to be wavering between the two, and her attitude frequently changed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder if she’s finally trying to get the environment fixed. At any rate, Hasumi-san hasn&#8217;t given it to you yet? Maybe she’ll give it to you when you get back.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that it’s something I don&#8217;t need to know. If it&#8217;s something I don&#8217;t need to know, I won&#8217;t force her to tell me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, it’s great that I’ve been given the key to the house, but I’d like to get Hasumi-senpai’s contact info in case something comes up.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don’t you just ask her in her classroom? You know her classroom, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course I do. I can if we’re both at school.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s my last resort because Hasumi-senpai would be annoyed if I suddenly went to see her. That&#8217;s why I want to exchange phone numbers, email addresses, messaging app IDs, and etcetera.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For example, if I suddenly have to run an errand right now and have to come home late, there&#8217;s no way for me to call her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so. If it&#8217;s a date, you’ll just be home a little late, but if you don&#8217;t come home, you’ll have to let Hasumi-san know or she&#8217;ll be worried.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why that situation? Whatever, you get what I said.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai spoke with a serious look on her face, and I answered her in an annoyed tone. Putting the reason aside, the situation was not wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don’t you just ask her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s the thing. When it comes down to it, it’s kinda embarrassing.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I understand how Hasumi-senpai felt yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it was a girl in my class or something, I could just ask casually.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop right there, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai&#8217;s voice was sharp, as if she had heard something wrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can ask a girl’s contact info so naturally?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It depends on the purpose and flow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you’re in a group on a field trip, or when you’re given a group assignment in class. Or when you get to know each other in some way, like exchanging business cards. As usual, I know when and how to ask, and I have never been denied before.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you didn’t ask mine.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In your case, Takinami-senpai, I recognized you as someone I should be wary about from the very first day I spoke to you. I didn&#8217;t recognize you that way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, I now have Takinami Ruika&#8217;s phone number and e-mail address written in my address list, and she’s registered as a friend in my messaging app.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, whatever. I also got a mountain of boys’ contact info, so I’m one to talk.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai snorts and says triumphantly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose. You’re very popular after all―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course that&#8217;s not true! You know, you should at least be a little concerned about your girlfriend&#8217;s relationships.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, my bad. It was supposed to be an act?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I seriously didn&#8217;t realize that. When I talk to Takinami-senpai, sometimes I can&#8217;t keep up with her because of the difference in our social hierarchy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also, don’t self-proclaim yourself as my girlfriend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew you&#8217;d say that. Geez.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai exhales a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry to interrupt the excitement.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Kanata-senpai who let out a voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, I’ll be borrowing this. Can I still do it now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. I usually turn off the terminal at the last second”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Some students rush to borrow the room after the bell rings, and because it’s also still within the opening hours.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I received the book from Kanata-senpai. The library card was on top of the book and held by her thumb.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The barcode reader reads the barcodes on the card and the book in sequence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The return date will be in two weeks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I told Kanata-senpai about the return deadline, Kanata-senpai curtly replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had already prepared to leave. She received the book and her library card that I returned, tossed them into her school bag, and left the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Kanata-senpai was out of sight, the main bell rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Her demeanor is as unique as ever.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When it finished ringing, Takinami-senpai uttered in the aftermath of the sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She’s always been like that. I guess it&#8217;s something she’s born with. It&#8217;s not that she’s playing a character like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe she doesn&#8217;t want to talk to people because she&#8217;s like that? So as not to scare people away?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s simply her personality.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, I only knew about it four years ago when I met Kanata-senpai, so maybe something happened earlier than that. As for the present, she simply has something she wants to do, and she’s just immersed in it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now then, could please get out, Takinami-senpai? I’m going to close the room.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You really don’t have respect for your upperclassmen, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai said with a sigh and turned on her heel. She picked up her bag, which was on the reading table near the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, right. Shizuru. About Hasumi-san’s contact number―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s fine. I’ll ask her myself.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied, interrupting her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know that Takinami-senpai knows Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s contact info, but I will ask her myself. Since I was entrusted with the key to the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when Takinami-senpai heard my response, she blinked her eyes for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, nothing. It sounds interesting, so I’ll keep my mouth shut.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like I’m hearing unpleasant things―along with something I </span><span style="font-weight: 400">don&#8217;t need to know. As I said earlier, I&#8230;</span><span style="font-weight: 400">.don&#8217;t have the hobby of forcing people to say what they don&#8217;t want to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, Takinami-senpai left.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I closed the library, following the usual procedure.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next problem is to get Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s contact information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let’s just hope for the best.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I boarded the train and got off at Myodani station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, there’s only one barrier: the embarrassment of having to ask openly. Conversely, that’s all it is. Moreover, since I’m not hitting on her, there’s no fear of being rejected. The embarrassment is temporary. If so, there’s no need to think too hard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I left the ticket gate with this in mind, my name was called.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like a replay of yesterday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, when he turned back, standing there was not Hasumi-senpai, but rather Naoi Kyouhei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So we’re in the same train.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He came up to me with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He’s not wearing a uniform, but in club jerseys and T-shirts. I heard that the athletic club&#8217;s practice usually lasts until 7:00 p.m, so they may have been dismissed early today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Working in the library again? That’s tough when you’re the only member.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s my job after all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it&#8217;s not something anyone can do. It’s discouraging.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I then walked side by side with Naoi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know where he lives, but it appears to be at least within walking distance of the station, and we’ll be going in the same direction for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, I saw you here yesterday with Hasumi-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a short walk, Naoi suddenly spoke up. He was slightly tense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, that’s the time when I bumped into Hasumi-senpai when she was out shopping. It seems Naoi was also there and saw us. Did practice finish early, or was it called off?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you acquainted with Hasumi-senpai?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you before, right? That I’m staying with my relatives here. That house is close to Hasumi-senpai’s home. So we got acquainted.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave Naoi a story I made up in case something like this happened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. That’s really lucky. As a guy, I’m really jealous.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He became convinced and laughed. I felt a little sorry for him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We continue on walking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But there was no conversation, and we remained silent. The reason why I didn’t open my mouth is because I feel bad for Naoi. He’s unusual and not much of a talker, but he usually provides a good topic of conversation since he’s the center of the group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, my phone started ringing. It was a phone call.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took out my phone and looked at the display.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s from an unregistered number. But it was a familiar sequence of numbers. Where have I seen this number before?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll be going ahead. See you tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Naoi said goodbye, he quickly walked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt bad for his concern, so I tapped the call button, even though I didn&#8217;t know who was on the other end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hello?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Oh, Shizuru? Are you near the station? I want you to buy something for me.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And my knees almost collapsed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No wonder it looked familiar. I had called this number before, after Takinami-senpai had shown it to me. I now understood what Takinami-senpai said earlier. I could just look at the call history to know. I guess that’s what she wanted to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What have I been worrying about all this time…?</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That evening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right, Hasumi-senpai. Can I get your ID on the messaging app?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was in the living room, Hasumi-senpai came downstairs, operating her smartphone. I asked her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N?… Ah, alright. That may be more convenient than a phone call. Sure, sure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai says, &#8220;Wait a minute,&#8221; and swiftly operates her smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s faster this way than searching my ID.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A QR code is displayed. This is certainly the easiest way to add friends when the person you want to add is right in front of you. I opened my phone’s camera and scanned the QR code.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Done.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai sat down on the sofa.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the living room of the Hasumi residence, there’s a large sofa that can accommodate three people and a sofa for one person. The long sofa is my position, and the single-seater sofa is Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s position. Hasumi-senpai sits on the large sofa if Uncle is present, but otherwise not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sat down on the single-seater sofa, since Uncle is not here at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm, somehow this feels fresh.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And she spoke while looking at the screen of her smartphone. I’m sure that the screen is showing that I&#8217;ve been added as her friend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sure you must have a lot of friends. Why are you moved just by having one more?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that’s true. But actually, I don’t have a lot of male friends, you see.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a little surprising.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai looked annoyed when she saw my expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Do I look like I have many male friends?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no, it’s nothing like that…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she doesn&#8217;t have the image of keeping at hand numerous men who are interested in her. I simply assumed that she must have a lot of friends, regardless of gender.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, whatever. If anything happens, contact me using this.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now we have a means of communication.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that&#8217;s when Hasumi-senpai cuts in, looking like she’s having difficulty saying something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you also chatting with Takinami-san, Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not really. Because when it comes to exchanging messages one after another, I always think it’s easier and faster to do it by phone call.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t understand why they insist on doing it by chat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, really? I was just wondering if you two were saying things you can only say in chat…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-you know, like for example, ‘What are you wearing right now?’ or ‘What do you think I’m wearing right now?’ things like that…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, never. That’s not happening.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-hey, stop looking at me like I’m a pitiful girl!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">C**p. Did I look at her like that unconsciously? Hasumi-senpai is also a person who doesn&#8217;t understand love in a different sense after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As expected, no girl is like―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takinami-san would.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai interrupted my words as I was about to say something and confidently stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I could see that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unexpectedly, we were in agreement. Takinami-senpai would never even dream of being judged like this.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 3</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it was not even July yet, when I went to the school that day, I saw a bamboo branch standing in the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akanedai High School used to be an all-girls school until a few years ago. The students had been decreasing, so to combat that, they renewed the uniforms, remodeled the buildings and expanded the facilities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to the renovations at that time, there were several neat little places on campus that are popular with girls. This place is no exception. After entering the entrance and changing shoes at the shoe closet, you will find an open space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A tanabata bamboo branch was standing there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not there when I left yesterday, so the student council must have been busy putting it up after 6:00 pm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had no feeling of reminiscence from seeing the bamboo. After all, last year I was a freshman and had only been in school for three months. All the school events were new to me, so they passed by in a blink of an eye. Next year feels like a long time away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was staring at the bamboo, a voice called out to me from behind. It was Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Takinami-senpai. Good norming.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We both greet each other with our masks on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai stood beside me and looked up at the bamboo in the same way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s here this year again.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I&#8217;m not as deeply moved as Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking around, there’s a desk by the wall with strips of paper and several pens. I guess the idea was to write your wishes on the strips of paper and tie them to the bamboo branches. The more I think about it, the more I realize that this is just a whatever event.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning my attention back to the bamboo branches again, I saw that several strips of paper were already hanging. They seemed to be related to grades or entrance examinations. It must be because the final exam is coming soon. How diligent. But more mischievous things are going to be on it soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you going to write anything, Takinami-senpai?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Secret.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her about it, she replied with a mischievous smile.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At this kind of thing, it’s best if you don’t tell anyone.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So she might not write anything, or she won’t tell the contents?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How about you, Makabe-kun?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing in particular.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not Hasumi-senpai, but I&#8217;m not the type to participate in this kind of event either.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why not? How about writing, ‘I hope I get a wonderful girlfriend’ or something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai giggles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;d like to be able to handle that on my own, without asking Orihime.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so. It&#8217;s true that you don&#8217;t have to ask for help, but they might be nearby. Like right next door.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai stated meaningfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked to the side. Of course, it was the opposite side from where she was.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, I don&#8217;t see anyone next to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, you…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai murmurs in a voice only I can hear. She turned her face toward me. It’s not that her face only changes when we are alone, but somehow I thought it did just now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I looked at her face sideways, I suddenly remembered Kanata-senpai&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Be true to your own feelings, huh…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you say something?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai tilts her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Real talk―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deciding that a response to her question is unnecessary, so I cut her off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know you’re right beside me. So I don’t need to bother asking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I replied in such a way that the others could not hear me, Takinami-senpai froze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It is said that in Tanabata, it’s Orihime who makes it come true, but in actuality it’s yourself. If so, is the act of writing one&#8217;s wish on a tanzaku a pledge or a declaration of one&#8217;s determination? I don’t intend to deny the act of writing down one&#8217;s wishes, and in fact, I approve of it. However, I would like to refrain from doing so.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/0qFt7Qz/00014.jpg" alt="00014" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The question is, am I qualified to take the first step?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s certain that Makabe Shizuru likes Takinami Ruika. I&#8217;m just not sure if it&#8217;s real or not. Still, I have to face these feelings and come to a conclusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left the frozen Takinami-senpai behind and turned my body toward the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Shi… Makabe-kun, what do you mean by t―?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She immediately came to her senses and tried to chase after me. However, her behavior was so out of character for her, which made everyone look at her, so she gave up for the time being.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lunch break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had lunch with Karube Kagemitsu and Heshikiri Sakura-san―after that, I went together with Karube to the cafeteria to get coffee, and it was unexpectedly packed in front of the vending machine. Naoi Kyouhei&#8217;s group also came to the vending machine at the same time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. Go ahead and buy something.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi stopped a few steps before me and let me go first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind Naoi, Izumikawa clicked his tongue. For him, it’s not right that their leader let someone else go first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind me, Karube snickered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You completely stopped eating at the school cafeteria, Makabe. Do you still buy food at the convenience store?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi talks to me as I buy a can of coffee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, I had that as my setup. The first time Hasumi-senpai made me lunch, Naoi invited me to the school cafeteria, and I quickly said no.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I have packed lunch now. My auntie makes it for me everyday.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this case, I wondered if Hasumi-senpai was the aunt. I saw the image of her mouth twitching in my mind&#8217;s eye, so I apologized to her inwardly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. I was wondering if you would call on me again when you got tired of eating lunch boxes at the convenience store. If it&#8217;s packed lunch, we won&#8217;t be eating together anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi laughed, a little disappointed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thanks. See ya.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I take out a can of coffee, put it in my mouth, and give up my position to Naoi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And that is when it happened. As Naoi was about to step forward in front of the vending machine, he noticed something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was taken aback by his words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around and saw Hasumi-senpai in the doorway of the cafeteria. She’s accompanied by several friends. It&#8217;s her group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai came this way when she heard Naoi&#8217;s voice. She probably intended on going to the vending machine from the beginning, so she didn’t have to change the direction she’s looking at.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aren’t you Naoi-kun? It’s been a while.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s been a while.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two exchange words. They seem to know each other. They’re both at the top caste on campus, so it’s not surprising that they interact with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I&#8217;m a little concerned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi Kyouhei is smart and stylish. He’s always calm and relaxed. But there’s something childish about him now. If I had to use a metaphor, I would say that he’s hiding an uncontrollable excitement at meeting a celebrity he really admires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai glanced at me. Since it will look a bit shameless if I greet her with “Hi”, I just bowed my head. Hasumi-senpai smiled and slightly raised her hand in response, as if she felt the same way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;re in the same school, but it’s surprising how often we don&#8217;t see each other.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Naoi, are you close with Hasumi-senpai?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be strange to stand idly next to them or to walk away in silence, so I tried to join in with some bland talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, Senpai and I were in the same middle school. Since we&#8217;re both in a sports club, we see each other on the field.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard that Hasumi-senpai was in the track and field club. I wonder where Naoi was? Now he’s in the handball club, but I don&#8217;t think there’s much of that in middle school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She was a high jumper, and she had such a beautiful figure. I used to look so much that the older members of the club would scold me for it”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That was a long time ago. And I was angry too. You’re always looking at me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi spoke enthusiastically, and Hasumi-senpai chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that Naoi didn’t know that she was angry and said, “Seriously?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One person from his group said, “Kyouhei, how lame.” Naoi replied with a laugh, “Shut up.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ah, I see. So that&#8217;s how it is. Thinking back, when we discussed who was cuter, Takinami-senpai or Hasumi-senpai, Naoi was in favor of Hasumi-senpai. This made it even more difficult for me to talk about my relationship with Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai, you live close to Makabe, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps sensing that the mood was worsening, Naoi changed the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">C**p. I hadn&#8217;t shared that info with Hasumi-senpai yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un? Ah, so that’s how it is.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She tilted her head for a moment, then nodded her head as if she came to a conclusion. It wasn&#8217;t that far-fetched, so she would probably go along with it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me and Makabe-kun are―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shion-chan, you’re curious about Librarian-kun, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bfuh</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai couldn&#8217;t help but gush at the voice that suddenly interrupted her. Voices around were saying, “Huh?”, “What?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person behind that voice earlier was a petite girl―Shiiba Akane, one of Hasumi-senpai’s friends.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-n-no, y-you’re wrong. What are you saying?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai blushed and stuttered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her splendid flurry drew stares from those around her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai, Hasumi-senpai, no one thinks it’s true. Please calm down.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ah, I guess so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai takes one deep breath.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, we are siblings. We know better than anyone else that’s not happening. But if we got flustered, we would look even more suspicious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai glared at Shiiba-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So! Why! Are! You! Always! Like! This!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she grabs her head with both hands and begins to shake it with all her might. And from Shiiba-senpai’s mouth―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aughh…” A small scream escapes. So she was saying things like that all the time? If that&#8217;s the case, then Hasumi-senpai should just get used to it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi was laughing at Hasumi-senpai, who had begun to tighten up Shiiba-senpai. I called out to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Naoi, just now―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know. Shiiba-senpai is just that kind of person.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was relieved that he didn’t take her word seriously.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 4</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the library after school that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, while I was looking at the wall clock, thinking that it was almost time for Takinami-senpai to show up, Hasumi-senpai arrived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, she appeared to be in a bad mood the moment she entered, and remained silent as she walked up to the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, is there something wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but call out to her first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“L-Listen…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was unusually not straightforward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“About earlier… don’t take it seriously, okay?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She says in a whisper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The thing earlier, that would be about Shiiba-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the reading room first. The library is about to close in less than 30 minutes. Usually, there would be a few people left in the library, but for some reason, today, all the regulars left early and Kanata-sensei was the only one left. As usual, she’s writing something in her notebook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my eyes back to Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won’t… Although it&#8217;s just half, we’re still related.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah, I guess so…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sighed in exasperation as she responded in a sulking manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sure Shiiba-senpai has mentioned that kind of thing often. Shouldn’t you get used to it by now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-that’s true. Sorry, I was too flustered.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And she reflected. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You came here only to talk about that? You could have just talked about it when we got back home.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I just wanted to say it in a public place, before we’re alone…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really don’t understand her reasoning. It must be a very stressful thing for Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai, do you have any experience with men?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-of course not!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She slammed the counter as hard as she could, leaned forward, and yelled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the reading table again. Kanata-senpai was looking at us. I raised one hand to signal to her, &#8220;It&#8217;s nothing.” In reality, such a simple gesture doesn’t exist, but it seems she understood what I wanted to say. Kanata-senpai looked down at her notebook again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry, I made a mistake. Have you ever dated someone…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What kind of mistake is that…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai took her body away from the counter and glared at me with her arms folded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;No.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She reluctantly answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder if that&#8217;s the reason why you were so flustered by Shiiba-senpai&#8217;s jokes. You don&#8217;t have the tolerance for it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By that logic, does that mean you’ve had a girlfriend before, Shizuru?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why the past tense?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? You really had one?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems that she misunderstood my silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t have anyone like that. In my case, I was born with a personality like this.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I get it. You&#8217;re strangely calm, and sometimes I can&#8217;t tell if you&#8217;re joking or serious when you say things.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, it was actually something I acquired.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, Hasumi-san is here.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice suddenly came, which belonged to Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai made an unexplainable expression and turned around. I have a bad feeling about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you talking about something interesting?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so. In a way, we were talking about something that you would like very much. But unfortunately, It’s already over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but laugh. It’s true that talking about relationships with the opposite s*x is something that Takinami-senpai would like to talk about.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Hasumi-senpai looked at me and Takinami-senpai alternately, and she seemed to have a slight thought―and then it appeared that something in her mind flashed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She continued her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, right, Shizuru. About the promise of us going out together, we’ll do it this Sunday.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is that something to talk about now?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sure enough, Takinami-senpai&#8217;s eyes turned sharp.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a moment you two. A date? Is it a date?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast, Hasumi-senpai was surprisingly calm. Has she managed to gain understanding by reflecting on the incident earlier? No, no. It was simply within an acceptable range.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just a family going out shopping. A family.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guh….”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Hasumi-senpai spoke with a special emphasis on family, Takinami-senpai was speechless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this had been a date, she could have interfered. Well, if that really was the case, I’m still not sure about her interfering. But if it&#8217;s a family out shopping, that&#8217;s it. She just has to sit and watch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It would be tasteless to just go out and buy something and come back home. Maybe we could watch a movie while we&#8217;re at it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that case, what would Uncle do? Will he stay home alone and eat whatever?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, is there somewhere else you want to go?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no, I don&#8217;t really…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Well, you should think about it by the end of the week. Then, I’ll head home first. Oh, Takinami-san, take care of the rest. You can do whatever you want with Shizuru, at least for now.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thus, Hasumi-senpai gave a victorious smile and left the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And the agitated Takinami-senpai stared at the doorway in frustration.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, it was probably payback for the other day. Back when Takinami-senpai and I were on our so-called date, she was agitating Hasumi-senpai. As a result, Hasumi-senpai started following us. Well, Takinami-senpai had her own ideas.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai also came up with an unbelievable idea.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, you should have said something smart too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The sharpness of her gaze was not so different from when she was staring at the doorway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What smart thing?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like, ‘You’re the only one I will go on a date with.’ or ‘I’m just playing around with that woman.’ or something!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course it&#8217;s going to feel out of place if you spit out dialogue that ignores the character’s settings. Would there even be a demand demand for such an inconsistent character?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s so angry that she’s mumbling crazy things. I think she must have understood a little of how Hasumi-senpai felt at that time.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At closing time, I somehow managed to get rid of Takinami-senpai, who had become a real pain in the a*s, and headed to Kanata-senpai’s seat.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at me with cold eyes. Her stuff is already packed, as if she was waiting for me to come.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai&#8217;s stare is so sharp that even when she is acting normally, her gaze can chill the hearts of those around her… is what I would like to say, but that’s not the case right now. I almost want to turn back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t you have something to say to me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, Hasumi-senpai forced me into her schedule.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, Kanata-senpai was now angry, exactly as she appeared. Hasumi-senpai, Takinami-senpai, and I―she must have been watching the exchange between us three.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought I told you we’re gonna go out, so you should follow me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You did.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s right, I had a promise with Kanata-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was right after I decided to stay with the Hasumi family. I made a promise in the library when it was about to close. As she had just said, we were going out, so she asked me to follow her. It may sound like a one-sided order, but Kanata-senpai and I are always like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We had originally planned to do it after the exams were over, and then we delayed it a bit until this weekend.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What should we do? If I tell her I have plans on Sunday, I’m sure she’ll change it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s what Hasumi-senpai also said. </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">If it&#8217;s not convenient for you, just say so.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> The reason she was so forceful in her decision earlier was probably because she was in front of Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. I’ll take you some other time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew you would say that, Kanata-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she let out an exasperated sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she continues chillingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When did you become such a spoiled man? Or have those two been babying you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could you please stop talking about that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A chuckle escaped my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;ll have to ask yourself if it is true or not. I’m going home.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, yes. Please take care…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai gets up from her chair and heads for the exit while I look on in amazement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Somehow, it felt like I got pushed aside…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems I&#8217;m not the only one… who’s angry that my schedule was ruined because they forced me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After this, </span><span style="font-weight: 400">I met Takinami-senpai who was waiting for me as if it was natural</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. Needless to say, she insisted that I go home with her, and I had to listen to her complain endlessly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And when I got home, Hasumi-senpai was waiting for me with a bad mood and said, &#8220;I-It’s not a date. Don&#8217;t misunderstand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a long day.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 5</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai came to the library after school unusually early.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m guessing that, based on the situation, there&#8217;s something she wants to say or ask, and from past experience, it’s usually not a good thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe-kun, have you made any plans for the weekend?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai asks with a friendly smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For example, if this is her indirectly asking me on a date, it’s fine. But in reality, she’s trying to dig for info about me and Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s schedule.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder why she has such a big smile on her face in spite of this. I guess it&#8217;s partly because there are a few people around, but</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> the problem is what she&#8217;s doing</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> doesn&#8217;t match her facial expression.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I think so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you tell me for reference?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">What reference?</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> If I ask that, I would be doing exactly what Takinami-senpai wants.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The location is Sannomiya.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Sannomiya, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Takinami-senpai and I have been to Sannomiya before, you can’t go wrong with that place. There are many entertainment facilities, and even if you suddenly decide to go somewhere on a whim, there are several JR lines and major private railways, so you can go anywhere you want to go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That would be the normal reason to choose it, but Hasumi-senpai seemed to have strong feelings about it when she decided we would go there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So when are you going?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re gonna match it up with lunch, so I think we’ll be there by 11:30 am.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It takes 18 minutes to go from Myodani to Sannomiya by the Kobe City Subway, so we will be leaving the house by 11:00 am.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami nodded her head and inputted the information into her head. At any rate, I guess she got all the information she needed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All things considered, you guys are getting along really well now, so much that you’d go out together.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I owe it to you, Takinami-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Hasumi ran away from home before, Takinami-senpai helped me to catch her. That was the start of our relationship getting better.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that the case? I only gave you Hasumi-san&#8217;s contact information. The rest was between you siblings.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that&#8217;s what you think, don&#8217;t try to collect my debt.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Who was it that asked me to go on a date with her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We have to use whatever we can.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re the same as usual.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I honestly admire the style in which she tries to use whatever weapons she has as a woman.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Takinami-senpai…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I leaned forward a little and let out a whisper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai also seemed to sense the mood of the private conversation and leaned her upper body slightly towards me. Our faces became closer to each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you please not use the word siblings in school?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, why not? Isn’t it fine? It’s the truth after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her response sounded like an attempt to get my true feelings out of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I leaned my body against the back of the office chair to keep our faces far apart.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t want people to know that Hasumi-senpai and I are siblings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I continue to speak in a toned-down voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please don’t ask why. Of course there is the matter of our parents&#8217; relationship, but more than that, it would be lame for Hasumi-senpai to have me as her younger brother.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On one hand is a popular and beautiful girl who’s admired along with Takinami Ruika, and on the other hand is just an ordinary male student. It’s certain that she doesn’t want anyone to know that she has an unremarkable younger brother.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it really?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai tilts her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did Hasumi-san say that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, she didn’t. Okay. I’ll stop assuming Hasumi-senpai’s feelings. But even without that, I feel a little bit drawn back by the fact I’m that person’s little brother.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Alright, I’ll be careful.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Also, the only people who know about the relationship between me and Hasumi-senpai are Karube, Heshikiri-san, and Kanata-senpai. They’re not the kind of people who would bring up this subject in talks. Even if they were to talk about it, they would consider the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think, Makabe-kun?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Takinami-senpai asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s with the sudden question?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve been meaning to ask you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai says with a friendly smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although there’s a distance from the counter to the reading table, it’s natural she has that expression on her face because she’s under the public eye. However, she usually returns to her true face and demeanor at times like this. Conversely, now that she’s not doing it, it seems as if she’s hiding her true intentions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sure that Hasumi-senpai is a very open and honest person. She has a good reputation after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does being in close proximity change that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Since we started living together, I got to know a different face from the one I saw at school, but I guess that&#8217;s just another side of Hasumi-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She would sulk and run away from home, or get angry and pinch Uncle&#8217;s cheeks. Or, on the other hand, she would comfort me when I’m down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m honestly glad to be that person&#8217;s brother. Although I might just be an inconvenience for… Hasumi-senpai, though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai smiles. Again, it was the tender smile that everyone wanted from her. And her only response was that brief phrase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, right, Makabe-kun. There’s a book I’d like you to tell me where to find.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She spoke in a bit louder tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder if her voice could be heard all the way to the reading area. Perhaps it was an appeal to make it look like she was asking for books because the conversation has gone on for an unexpectedly long time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure. What book is it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The Name of the Rose by Umberto Eco.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that would be at the backmost bookshelf.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No need to search for it on the computer. Literature is last in the Nippon Decimal Classification (NDC). Among them, Italian literature is at the back of the list.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">NDC, as the name implies, is a Japanese classification, so naturally the literature at the top of the list is Japanese. From there, Chinese literature, English, German, French, Spanish, and finally Italian literature.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you. I’ll look for it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai then left the counter and walked to the stacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her gone, I return to my unfinished work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even so, I&#8217;m getting more and more knowledgeable. I’m answering questions based on proper knowledge. I wonder if this is thanks to the seniors who graduated from the library committee and to him who stood on the podium that day to give a lecture.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was chuckling to myself, I noticed that Takinami-senpai had not returned.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked at the clock on the wall. I don&#8217;t know the exact time she went to look for the book, but it felt like five minutes had passed. The book she was looking for was at the far end of the stacks, but even so, it shouldn’t take that long.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or can she not find it? I put a note on the counter that said, &#8220;Currently out of commission. I will be right back.&#8221; and stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the far end of the stacks, where Takinami-senpai disappeared.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There she was, sitting on a stool used to take books from a high place, reading a book. It seems she had turned the pages of a book she had found and is currently in the middle of reading it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re late.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She noticed my presence and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I started reading it because you were so slow, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, the situation is not that I came looking for Takinami-senpai because she didn’t come back, but rather she started reading a book because I didn’t come looking for her? More to the point, the fact that she was looking for a book was probably a lie to lure me here. And if she was looking for Italian literature, it would be at the very back of the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is surprisingly interesting.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of me, Takinami-senpai fluttered a hardcover book. ―The Name of the Rose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s the last masterpiece of the twentieth century. So, what do you want?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Want to kiss?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way she asks me is so casual, as if she’s inviting me out to play since the weather is nice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t it wonderful that our first kiss would be in the school library? This is exactly what you would call a high school experience.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai speaks of such things innocently and somewhat upliftingly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You long for the weirdest things, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m just a little jealous because you’re going to go on a date with Hasumi-san and even said it&#8217;s nice to see another side of her.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stood up as she interrupted my words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We faced each other between the narrow shelves of books.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now, what to do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s hard to get through to Takinami Ruika, but as usual, if I choose the best words and facial expressions, she will let me off the hook here. It would be even easier if I could just turn my back and say, &#8220;Stop being ridiculous.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are several ways to work through this situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But all is dismissed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recalled it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai’s words, that I’m being spoiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know if this is what she meant. But I thought she was right that I was being spoiled by Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s a blessing that Takinami Ruika favors me so much. But it’s neither infinite nor for granted. If I take advantage of it and give nothing in return, she will eventually leave me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m just one male student out of many.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You think?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai curiously tilts her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m just an ordinary boy, at least to the extent that I can only admire a famous senior student from afar. But what makes me a little different from the others is that I know a different side of Hasumi-senpai that she doesn&#8217;t show at school.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And also, I know the other side of your face, Takinami-senpai. I guess that&#8217;s where I feel a little superior.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai became silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was very quiet. It was probably because this was the library and we’re at the back of the room. From the window, I could faintly hear the voices of the athletic teams practicing. The floor was carpeted, and there were hardly any footsteps. I wondered, if anyone came in here now, would they notice us? I was thinking of such useless things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, Takinami-senpai opens her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, you are surprisingly cunning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kindred spirits</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I replied, she puffed out her cheeks a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I also know the real face of the kind librarian.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please keep that to yourself, Takinami-senpai.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, that’s the plan.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai smiles mischievously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Or smiling like an accomplice who shares a secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll go back.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll stay here a little bit longer. I kind of like it here. It&#8217;s good for when I need to think or be alone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a library </span><span style="font-weight: 400">people rarely come to</span><span style="font-weight: 400"> after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a chuckle, I turned on my feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai stopped me and I turned around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why don&#8217;t we just kiss here anyway? It&#8217;ll make you feel more superior like no other.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll pass.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geez.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turn my back again to Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And this time, I didn&#8217;t stop as I went back to the counter.</span></p>
