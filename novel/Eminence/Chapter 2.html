<h2>Chapter 2: Shocking Morning, School Skewer Murder Case!!</h2>


<p>Waking up was refreshing.</p>



<p>This is thanks to the free black robe of dark spider silk I got last night. I admired the robe shining in the morning sun and headed to the academy a little earlier than usual.</p>



<p>I went to school alone for the first time in a long time.</p>



<p>Hyoro and Jaga are always on the verge of being late.</p>



<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s nice to get to school early.</p>



<p>The faces of the students passing by are also fresh, and when I pass through the school gate and soak up the morning sun, it&#8217;s the bes&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s the worst.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is Pochi here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is Alexia here?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I passed through the school gate, Alexia was there.</p>



<p>&#8220;You should be a little happy to see me in the morning.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Waah, I&#8217;m so happy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s obvious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, later.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t run away, wait.&#8221;</p>



<p>As soon as I started walking, Alexia immediately came alongside me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you following me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because when you run away, it makes me want to chase you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you a fierce beast?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It must be an honor to go to school with me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you quiet?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; You have a happy head, I think.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not as much as you.&#8221;</p>



<p>As we walked along, talking about such things, we saw a crowd of people in front of the school building.</p>



<p>I can hear the buzz of students.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-It&#8217;s dead&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who did such a terrible thing&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi, don&#8217;t come any closer! The Knights are coming. Until then&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia and I looked at each other.</p>



<p>&#8220;A dead body, they said!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go there.&#8221;</p>



<p>This is the first surprise event in a long time in the unchanged school life.</p>



<p>It is natural to be excited with anticipation.</p>



<p>I pushed my way through the crowd, my eyes sparkling with wonder at what kind of corpse I would find.</p>



<p>And —— I was astonished.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, they mean this one.&#8221;</p>



<p>Come to think of it, I remember last night I kicked him off the roof and left him where he was.</p>



<p>I had completely forgotten about it.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s terrible&#8230;&#8230;I can&#8217;t believe they skewered him on the sword of a statue. I wonder if it&#8217;s an execution.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it just happened to pierce him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That can&#8217;t be true. There&#8217;s always a reason for such a particular way of killing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia was looking at the corpse with a serious face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who is he? He doesn&#8217;t look like he belongs to the academy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s a thief.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t look like he&#8217;s from the Knights. Probably an intruder&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s a thief.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Could he be from the cult, or&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s a thief~.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve been so noisy since a while ago. There is no way he is a thief&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Well, fine.</p>



<p>The students around me seem to be happy, and when I think about it, it can be said that it was as originally planned.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m scared &#8230;&#8230; Don’t tell me, it was that organization.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And the missing student hasn&#8217;t been found yet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There is also the matter of the magic power the other day. I think there&#8217;s something behind this case.&#8221;</p>



<p>They are happy.</p>



<p>The truth is that it&#8217;s a dog and cat fight and a thief falling to his death. If it&#8217;s as exciting as this, I&#8217;m very satisfied as the instigator.</p>



<p>What should I do, maybe I can dress up as Shadow tonight or so and make the event even more exciting.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you making a creepy smiling face?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? Ah, nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia&#8217;s red eyes were looking at me curiously.</p>



<p>&#8220;You two, do you have a moment?&#8221;</p>



<p>At that time, there was a boy who was talking to us.</p>



<p>The handsome guy with the dark green hair, he is Isaac-kun.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yaa, Isaac-kun. Did you get a good rest yesterday?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Etto, if I am not wrong, you are Sid-kun, right. I had some business to attend to yesterday. Is there something wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There was a quiz.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So there was a quiz. And?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then it&#8217;s fine. But more importantly, school&#8217;s closed for the day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a terrible incident. I&#8217;ve been instructed to leave the scene of the crime because the school officials and the Knights are going to investigate. Thugs may be lurking in the area, so be careful. Never leave the dormitory.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuhn Fuhn.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dangerous, so be careful too, Pochi.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay——&#8221;</p>



<p>At that moment, with a clank, something stuck in my neck.</p>



<p>Is this a collar?</p>



<p>&#8220;I finally got you.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I turned around, there was nee-san with a big smile on her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yaa, long time no see, nee-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really been a long time. I think the last time we saw each other was before winter break.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;R-Right.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shoot, I let my guard down.</p>



<p>It was troublesome, so I acted accordingly to avoid seeing nee-san.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nee, Claire. That collar&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong with this collar?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Was that Claire&#8217;s collar?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. It was supposed to be in my room, but for some reason the Knights kept it. It was very hard to get it back.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-Is that so? What are you using it for?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What, you ask&#8230;&#8230;Isn&#8217;t it obvious?&#8221;</p>



<p>Clank, nee-san laughs as she pulls the chain.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, unn, right&#8230;&#8230; I see, a dog needs collar?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right right, a collar is needed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ano, I&#8217;m not a dog.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about, you are Pochi, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid, you&#8217;re saying something funny. Let&#8217;s go, Pochi. No, I mean Sid.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nee-san pulled me by the chain and dragged me in front of the crowd.</p>



<p>Before I knew it, these two became friends.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>


<p>&#8220;How dare you break the promise we made.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Ahaha.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was taken to nee-san&#8217;s room and got mounted by her.</p>



<p>&#8220;In addition you lied to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Which lie?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Which lie, you said?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was strangled more.</p>



<p>Crap, I dug my grave.</p>



<p>I have no idea which lie it is because I have lied to nee-san countless times.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-It&#8217;s painful&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not painful.</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope you&#8217;re not lying to me about something else.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not lying, not lying&#8221;</p>



<p>I am lying.</p>



<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really, really.&#8221;</p>



<p>She looks into my eyes with her face so close that our noses touch.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Beautiful eyes. Proof that you have a pure heart. It seems you&#8217;re not lying now.&#8221;</p>



<p>She&#8217;s blind.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you lie to me, I&#8217;m going to find out soon enough. Why did you lie to me like that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know. It&#8217;s that lie, isn&#8217;t it? That thing you&#8217;re talking about&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, the lies about Nina.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;About Nina-senpai?&#8221;</p>



<p>Areh?</p>



<p>Did I lie about Nina-senpai?</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me you have forgotten about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t forgotten anything. It&#8217;s that stuff about Nina-senpai, right? It&#8217;s a complicated situation that can&#8217;t be explained in simple words&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haa&#8230;&#8230;You just made that up to impress me anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, something like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know everything you&#8217;re thinking.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I reflect on it&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay, I forgive you. Just this once.&#8221;</p>



<p>Talk is over.</p>



<p>Or so it should be, but nee-san stares at me intently.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nee-san, you&#8217;re heavy. It&#8217;s about time to move&#8230;&#8230;Ugih.&#8221;</p>



<p>M-My neck&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid, did you say something?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-Nee-san is so light, you are beautiful with great style!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, obviously.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Unn unn, it&#8217;s obvious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ufufu, Sid will always be Sid, no matter how old you get. I hope you stay that way forever. I am&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Nee-san creates a somewhat serious atmosphere.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nee-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If Sid can stay that way, I&#8217;m ready to face any formidable foe.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Etto&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Could this be the progression of the disease in question?</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid, listen. An evil and powerful organization is coming to our school.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, that pattern, right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I can&#8217;t tell you the details for your own safety &#8230;&#8230; Even if you stare at me with those eyes, it&#8217;s no good.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to solve the mystery of the school. It&#8217;s a dangerous mission &#8230;&#8230; but I feel like I can do it if it&#8217;s for Sid.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good luck!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Be careful, Sid. You are my little brother and they might target you. But I&#8217;ll do my best. I&#8217;ll beat the bad guys&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Get &#8217;em!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for making you worry. I&#8217;m sorry I couldn&#8217;t say anything important. But that&#8217;s to protect you. I know it&#8217;s all very selfish of me, but I want you to understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I get it&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then&#8230;&#8230;If I don&#8217;t come back&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m dea——&#8221;</p>



<p>In the middle of her tearful speech, nee-san suddenly stared into empty space.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Aurora, it&#8217;s an emotional scene, can you be quiet? Eh, what? Stop it because it&#8217;s embarrassing? What are you embarrassed about?&#8221;</p>



<p>Our eyes met as I looked up at her with a straight face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nee-san&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, t-this is n-n-nothing, I&#8217;m just talking to myself!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nee-san, I understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid&#8230;&#8230;Do you understand? There&#8217;s a deep reason for this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s an illness in the second year of junior high school.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, Sid. You&#8217;re too good a little brother for me. If &#8230;&#8230; I die &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>A large tear flows down nee-san&#8217;s cheek.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nee-san will be fine. You&#8217;re not going to die.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid——!! I&#8217;m definitely, definitely coming back!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes Yes&#8221;</p>



<p>I was hugged so tightly that my spine broke.</p>



<p>I wonder if this farce will end soon.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>The long-awaited night has arrived.</p>



<p>I sneak out of the dormitory and stand on the roof of the school as usual.</p>



<p>The school was on high alert, and entry and exit from the dormitory were strictly monitored. The students also seemed restless.</p>



<p>I never thought last night&#8217;s thieves would get this much attention. This kind of extraordinary feeling is exciting.</p>



<p>In my previous life, I was the type of person who got excited whenever a typhoon came.</p>



<p>Heavy wind and rain in a dimly lit classroom, even though it was daytime —— it&#8217;s the best.</p>



<p>It feels like something is about to happen. But nothing happened.</p>



<p>With such experience in my previous life, it would be my mission to make something happen.</p>



<p>The students are tired of the ordinary school life and are expecting an event to break it up.</p>



<p>&#8220;What shall I do?&#8221;</p>



<p>Four students go missing at the school, then a dog and cat fight, then a thief falls to his death from the roof &#8230;&#8230; is there any groundbreaking event that could tie it all together?</p>



<p>&#8220;Cast big magic circles or chanting spells&#8230;&#8230; Doesn&#8217;t that make sense? Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I was thinking about this, before I knew it, the area was covered in a white fog.</p>



<p>&#8220;Areh, is this the same &#8230;&#8230; anomaly I saw yesterday?&#8221;</p>



<p>Then my vision turned white, and I was in an endless white space.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s fantasy.</p>



<p>I was suddenly moved to another space. It&#8217;s happened before, I believe that was in Sanctuary &#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>There was a girl in the white space.</p>



<p>She is a little younger than me and wears a plain white dress. She has beautiful violet eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yaa, long time no see.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although the ages are different, I recognized her at a glance. She is Violet-san.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who are you? New researcher?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe you don&#8217;t remember?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, you saying something about sort of your memory?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Little Violet-san seems wary.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be so frightened. I&#8217;m not on the side of justice, but I&#8217;m not a despairing villain either.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-Why are you here&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wondered why. Before I knew it, I was here. What about you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am&#8230;&#8230; I am&#8230;&#8230; AAAAAAAAHHH&#8221;</p>



<p>She began to worry with her head in her hands.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am&#8230;&#8230; Why&#8230;&#8230; AAAAAAAAAAAAH&#8221;</p>



<p>She scratches her head and screams.</p>



<p>She looks like she&#8217;s in pain.</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to force yourself to remember. I&#8217;m forgetful too. I&#8217;m trying to reduce my brain&#8217;s memory by quickly forgetting things that don&#8217;t matter so I can focus on what&#8217;s important.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I, I am&#8230;&#8230; No&#8230;&#8230; Stop, stop already&#8230;&#8230; Noooooooo&#8221;</p>



<p>At the same time as the scream, a tremendous magic power was released.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oops. That&#8217;s why I said you didn&#8217;t have to remember.&#8221;</p>



<p>I fended off Violet-san&#8217;s magic.</p>



<p>As it is, I&#8217;m getting closer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come hereeeeeeeeeeeeeee.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is this magic?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was surprised.</p>



<p>The adult Violet-san was also amazing, but this is much more than that.</p>



<p>But straight-line magic is easy to fend off.</p>



<p>As I walked, I shifted the vector of magic and caught her.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, no, no, NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes Yes&#8221;</p>



<p>I hug Violet-san and let the magic flow through me.</p>



<p>It can be done in the same way as healing demonic possession. If I keep my whole body in close contact with it, it will be more efficient.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let go of me&#8230; Let go&#8230; of me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay to forget what you don&#8217;t want to remember.&#8221;</p>



<p>As the magic continues to flow, the outburst gradually subsides.</p>



<p>Her strength loosens and the tension melts away.</p>



<p>&#8220;H&#8230;&#8230; How about unforgettable things?&#8221;</p>



<p>She said so in a small voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who knows. If you try not to remember it, maybe one day you&#8217;ll forget it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Impossible.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Have you calmed down by now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;y&#8230;&#8230; Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I let go of Violet-san, she turned her head down in embarrassment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well. How do we get out?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; You&#8217;re leaving?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I started walking, she chased after me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eventually. I&#8217;m trying to figure out how to get out.&#8221;</p>



<p>The white space continues forever. There does not appear to be an exit.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone&#8217;s gone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not exactly.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Everybody&#8217;s dead.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sometimes it happens.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you going to die too?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to die.&#8221;</p>



<p>For the time being, I will live for 600 years. And beyond that, I&#8217;m in search of it.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re liar&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;If I find a way out, can you come with me? It&#8217;s easier if I just blow it up.&#8221;</p>



<p>Because that&#8217;s how the adult Violet-san disappeared.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t get out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;We&#8217;ll meet again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Liar&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a lie.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then &#8230;&#8230; give it to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Violet pointed to my pocket and said so.</p>



<p>I took out a red jewel from my pocket.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm. This is mine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s kind of warm. I feel calm.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just a jewel, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You are wrong. It&#8217;s something more important.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Unn.&#8221;</p>



<p>At that moment, I heard a door slam shut.</p>



<p>Violet-san trembled with a jolt.</p>



<p>There is no door anywhere in this white space. But I certainly heard it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi, where&#8217;d she go?!&#8221;</p>



<p>I could hear voices.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you hiding? Number——!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I have to go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, wait.&#8221;</p>



<p>The white space is cracking.</p>



<p>&#8220;Cut it out! I will hurt you again——&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, I&#8217;ll give you——&#8221;</p>



<p>I grabbed her hand, and then the white space shattered into pieces.</p>



<p>&#8220;——this&#8221;</p>



<p>The red jewel she offered fell off with a thud.</p>



<p>I was back on the rooftop.</p>



<p>The white fog, the white space, and the girl in the white dress disappeared.</p>



<p>I pick up the red jewel that has fallen and put it in my pocket.</p>



<p>&#8220;Violet-san, I wonder if she&#8217;s nearby?&#8221;</p>



<p>I send out a particle of magic and try to find her presence.</p>



<p>But I couldn&#8217;t find her.</p>



<p>Instead——.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this the presence of nee-san and Alexia?&#8221;</p>



<p>I wonder what they are doing in that place.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s open. This way.&#8221;</p>



<p>Under the moonlight, two shadows infiltrate the library through the window.</p>



<p>They are Alexia and Claire.</p>



<p>Alexia enters first and warns with awkward movements.</p>



<p>At that time——.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, get out of my way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ow.&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire came down from above.</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you doing? I told you I would first check the security.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia gets angry while being trampled.</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;ll know if you&#8217;re slow. Quickness is speed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aah, mou. Move aside, quickly.&#8221;</p>



<p>Moving Claire out of the way, Alexia stands up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alexia, let&#8217;s get going. We must succeed at all costs.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re pretty motivated, aren&#8217;t you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I now have a reason why I can&#8217;t lose. I have a place to return——&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire clenches her fist with a determined look in her eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t really understand it, but it&#8217;s good that you&#8217;re motivated.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia led the way and unlocked the door at the back of the library.</p>



<p>&#8220;How did you get that key?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Authority&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. This is the Forbidden Library?&#8221;</p>



<p>The rooms are lined with tall bookshelves.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not. This is the archives. The Forbidden Library is in the back——&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia stops in front of a huge bookshelf.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s big. I wonder if this is ancient letters&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The bookshelf itself is an artifact. There is a spell in a fairy tale that my father used to read to me when I was a child.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Spell?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia took a deep breath.</p>



<p>&#8220;Chichinpuipui, open sesame!&#8221;</p>



<p>Silence lasted for a while.</p>



<p>&#8220;What, are you kidding me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m not kidding! I&#8217;m serious! This spell is supposed to open it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Like an idiot&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe the spell was wrong. Maybe chinchinpuipui——&#8221;</p>



<p>And at that moment.</p>



<p>There was a rumbling sound and a huge bookshelf was opened.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eeh &#8230;&#8230; It really opens up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Looks like chinchin was the right one!&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia said with a smug look on her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just that it took a long time because it&#8217;s old.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia and Claire made their way to beyond the huge bookshelf.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8221;Amazing&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>The two who entered the forbidden library simply let out a voice of admiration.</p>



<p>A shining chandelier beautifully illuminated the bookshelves that soared high into the sky. The books lined up on the shelves were somewhat worn and faded, but still had a unique style.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, which book contains the history of the school?&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire said as she followed the endless spines of books with her eyes.</p>



<p>If they had to search for each book one by one, they would have to spend the night.</p>



<p>&#8220;We just have to pray silently.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I already said I&#8217;m not kidding! This way——&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia moved her arm strangely next to her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you doing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Creating Atmosphere. The school&#8217;s history book, the school&#8217;s history book, the school&#8217;s history book&#8230;&#8230; chinchinpuipui!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like an idiot&#8221;</p>



<p>But the next moment.</p>



<p>With a ray of light, a book flew by.</p>



<p>The book floats in front of Alexia&#8217;s face and automatically opens to the first page.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re kidding me&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Look. Like I told you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What a joke of an artifact. I&#8217;d like to destroy it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t do it. Isn&#8217;t it a cute, obedient artifact.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So what does the book say?&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire said with a fed up look on her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm. I can&#8217;t read it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is&#8230;&#8230;It&#8217;s an ancient script.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can read the simple ancient script, but this one is a bit. What about you, Claire.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I too have only the basics in Ancient Letters. It&#8217;s an unpopular subject, and only scholarship school students would take it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In times like this&#8230;&#8230;chinchinpuipui~ translate it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia made a heart with her hand along with her flirtatious voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s disgusting. Obviously it&#8217;s impossible&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You never know until you try it. There may be convenient functions.&#8221;</p>



<p>[T-T-T-Translate it, right. Dyufufu&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>A creepy voice echoed in the forbidden library.</p>


<p>&#8220;Eh, it talked!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is anyone there?&#8221;</p>



<p>The two look around, but there is no one else in sight.</p>



<p>[I-I-I-I&#8217;m the spirit of the Forbidden Library. I-I see you need me to translate it for you.]</p>



<p>&#8220;As expected of an artifact that the school is proud of.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Gross &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s a fat guy&#8217;s voice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Claire, don&#8217;t say something awful.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Uuwh&#8230;&#8230; I-I&#8217;m going to stop translating&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>&#8220;Look, he&#8217;s sulking.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Forbidden Library-san, please translate for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Mufufufu&#8230;&#8230; I-I&#8217;ll do my best to translate! W-W-What part of this do you want to be translated?]</p>



<p>&#8220;Etto, I would like to know where Diabolos&#8217; right arm is sealed.&#8221;</p>



<p>[I-I-If it is, then it&#8217;s in the basement of the academy. There&#8217;s an underground ruin.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Etto&#8230;&#8230; that&#8217;s so. That was simple&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; He&#8217;s surprisingly competent.&#8221;</p>



<p>The forbidden book, floating in mid-air, automatically turns the pages and the translated text glows faintly.</p>



<p>[O-Once upon a time, a hero and Diabolos fought here. Then Diabolos&#8217; right arm fell off and was sealed. Many things happened from there, and the ruins were built.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Many things happened?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Apparently, there was a fight over the right arm of Diabolos. It is not written in detail, but it seems that it was hidden in the underground ruins for various reasons.]</p>



<p>&#8220;How do I get to the underground ruins?&#8221;</p>



<p>[I-It seems there&#8217;s a sealed church <em>somewhere</em> in the academy, right? You can get there from there.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Where is that <em>somewhere</em>?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Dyufufu&#8230;&#8230; I-I can&#8217;t tell you what isn&#8217;t written down.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Cih, useless&#8230;&#8230; At least now we know what the Diabolos cult is after. They&#8217;re trying to break the seal on the right arm.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Any reason why they&#8217;re kidnapping students?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably to break the seal. It&#8217;s easier to break a seal when it&#8217;s close to the original magic power that sealed it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So they targeted the magic power that was compatible among the students. Want to find the so-called sealed church?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Before that, I&#8217;ll talk to onee-sama.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia said so, as if she had made up her mind.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, you were a member of the royal family. What, you should have done that from the beginning.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you think I haven&#8217;t done anything?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I told her many times. I told her about the incident at the academy, the incident at the sanctuary, everything&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alexia&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But &#8230;&#8230; this time. This time I have proof, and I&#8217;m sure onee-sama will believe me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Alexia-chan good luck~&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shut up, disgusting fat bastard.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia stares with eyes that could kill a person.</p>



<p>[Hi-Hiih&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>&#8220;Alexia &#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s time to leave the forbidden library. If we stay too long, they will find us.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. But before that, is there any book written about the Diabolos cult?&#8221;</p>



<p>There was a moment of silence.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230; It doesn&#8217;t exist here.]</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so&#8230;&#8230; It can&#8217;t be helped.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;See you then.&#8221;</p>



<p>[B-Bye bye&#8230;&#8230; Be careful&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>Alexia and Claire&#8217;s bodies became enveloped in magic, and then they found themselves back in the vault where they had been.</p>



<p>&#8220;With this book, I&#8217;m sure onee-sama will &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia left the vault with the forbidden book clutched to her chest.</p>



<p>At that time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Where are you going by taking the forbidden book out of the house without permission?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia and Claire turned around at the same time.</p>



<p>Behind the bookshelves stood a tall old man.</p>



<p>A slender face and sunken eyes. The eyes are glaring at them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-You&#8217;re the head librarian&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia hid the forbidden book behind her back, but it was too late.</p>



<p>&#8220;Princess Alexia. Even if it is you, it is a serious crime to take a forbidden book without permission. Even more so for the ordinary student next to you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire frowned when he looked at her.</p>



<p>Suspension or even expulsion. It could affect her brother.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kill him&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>In a small voice, Claire said so. Her eyes are clear.</p>



<p>Alexia hurriedly pushed Claire away.</p>



<p>&#8220;H-Head Librarian! There is a very good reason for this! Could you please listen to me for a moment?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If Princess Alexia has something to say, no one can refuse to listen to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s change places. Follow me.&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian said and left the library.</p>



<p>Alexia follows, whispering a question to Claire behind her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, what do you think you&#8217;re doing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If I become a criminal, Sid will be ridiculed! They&#8217;ll bully him by saying &#8216;Your sister&#8217;s a criminal&#8217;! He&#8217;s so weak, he&#8217;ll probably kill himself&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He won&#8217;t. Definitely.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia let out a sigh.</p>



<p>&#8220;Princess Alexia, please hurry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;ll be right there~&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia pulled Claire&#8217;s hand and followed the head librarian with a short run.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>&#8220;Ano, how far do you want us to go?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia called out to the head librarian walking in front of her.</p>



<p>His tall back advanced through the dark corridor.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re almost there.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you want to talk, we can do it in the classroom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Then, shall we do it here?&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, the head librarian stopped.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s in the middle of the hallway.</p>



<p>&#8220;Here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, Now that the preparations are done.&#8221;</p>



<p>He turned around and smiled thinly.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a smile she doesn&#8217;t like. Alexia frowned.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Alexia&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Fog is&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fog?&#8221;</p>



<p>Behind Alexia, Claire taps her on the shoulder.</p>



<p>When she looks around, she sees a white fog that has somehow gathered in the corridor.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why is there fog here&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the same?&#8221;</p>



<p>The fog is rapidly thickening.</p>



<p>From somewhere, a sound like something cracking.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is the same as when I was attacked&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>And then the world shattered.</p>



<p>The scenery shatters as if a mirror is broken.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What is this!&#8221;</p>



<p>They were supposed to be in the hallway of the school, but the air was completely different.</p>



<p>The world is shrouded in white fog.</p>



<p>A sweet smell comes from somewhere.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alexia, draw your sword.&#8221;</p>



<p>Prompted by Claire, Alexia also draws her sword.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re surrounded.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Searching for presence, she found several people behind a thick fog.</p>



<p>While looking at the two of them, they gradually close the distance. They don&#8217;t seem to be in a friendly mood.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m surprised you noticed them, Claire.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The ghost is excellent.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. So, head librarian.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia lowers her voice and points her sword at the head librarian.</p>



<p>He stood in the fog with a thin smile on his face.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it, Princess Alexia?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What does this mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>Coming here, Alexia wasn&#8217;t stupid enough to trust him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yare yare, you&#8217;re more perceptive than I thought.&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian pulled a large machete from his pocket.</p>



<p>One on the left hand and one on the right hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dangerous weapon. I think a head librarian should fight with pen and paper.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Pen and paper are ideals. Reality is built with the sword.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying that, he holds up a machete in each hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take the head librarian. Claire, you take care of the enemies around.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>As the two took up their positions back to back, the fight began.</p>



<p>Two machete blows strike out of the white fog.</p>



<p>Alexia takes a half step back to avoid the first blow and parries the follow-up blow with her sword.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hou.&#8221;</p>



<p>When the head librarian looks her in the eye, Alexia launches a counterattack.</p>



<p>The sword, which was natural without hesitation, carved a shallow wound on the head librarian&#8217;s cheek.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, well&#8221;</p>



<p>He stepped back out of the distance, rejoined the partition, and wiped the blood from his cheeks.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was surprised. You move like a different person from Princess Alexia I know.&#8221;</p>



<p>There was honest admiration in the voice of the head librarian.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a period of growth.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If so, it&#8217;s great. A sword holds a person&#8217;s accumulation of things. Before, you were just imitating Princess Iris. But now you have transformed it. No, I think it would be more appropriate to describe it as a combination of different things.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you have time to analyze?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——Even now?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Claire behind her who said that.</p>



<p>Around her, several figures fall, which gradually shatter and disappear.</p>



<p>The head librarian&#8217;s eyebrows move in surprise.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are seven of the 2nd wiped out? Claire Kagenou. She was this year&#8217;s winner of the Bushin Festival, wasn&#8217;t she? I&#8217;m sure she wasn&#8217;t this good, but she seems to use some kind of strange power.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Did you see it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You used red tentacles. Interesting.&#8221;</p>



<p>He did not miss Claire&#8217;s battle while fighting Alexia.</p>



<p>Alexia and Claire confront the head librarian.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now it&#8217;s two against one.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The tables are turned.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Does it look that way to you?&#8221;</p>



<p>He had some leeway.</p>



<p>&#8220;You are strong. But the two of us can beat you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A young, is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You seem so relaxed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because I&#8217;ve given up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Given up?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I gave up the sword, you see. This world is a big place. There is always someone better than you. So I don&#8217;t hate to see talented swords like yours. I am sure you will soon overtake me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;ve given up, surrender right now. I&#8217;ll make you tell me everything.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia said, and the head librarian smiled thinly.</p>



<p>&#8220;After all, you are young. If one doesn&#8217;t stick to swords, it means one can fight in a different way.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>The sweet smell tickled her nose.</p>



<p>Then two sounds overlapped, clang, clang.</p>



<p>It was the sound of Alexia and Claire&#8217;s swords falling to the floor.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wha&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Cih, my power&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This sweet smell is a potion that relaxes the muscles and confuses the magic power.&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian looked down at the two girls crouching unbearably on the floor.</p>



<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t &#8230;&#8230; you say you would fight with this sword.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You two are talented and have a bright future. That&#8217;s why you&#8217;re being swept off your feet by the likes of me.&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian takes out a rope and binds their arms.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tell me &#8230;&#8230; why you did this &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I wonder why.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You are strong. So why are you doing this&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; There&#8217;s always someone better than you. My sword has already been broken.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Broken&#8230;..? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>He had eyes that seemed to look somewhere far away.</p>



<p>&#8220;There once was a swordsman called &#8220;Fenrir&#8221;. Have you ever heard of him?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; No, I haven&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course you have. Everyone who lives in this country knows it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia thought of the contestants at the Bushin Festival and the rumored magic swordsmen in other countries, but had no idea who he was talking about.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Magic Swordsman Called &#8220;Fenrir&#8221; &#8230;&#8230; No way, the fairy tale?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That &#8220;Fenrir&#8221;. He was once called the strongest magic swordsman and made a name for himself around the world.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait! The Magic Swordsman Fenrir was alive hundreds of years ago! Who knows if he ever really existed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He really existed. Besides, that personage is still alive.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No way, he is alive&#8230;&#8230; Don&#8217;t tell me, Diabolos drops!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia remembered the story she had heard in the sanctuary.</p>



<p>It is said that there are beings called &#8220;Rounds,&#8221; who have gained eternal life by a drop of Diabolos.</p>



<p>&#8220;You even knew about the Diabolos drops? I knew I couldn&#8217;t let you live.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you going to do with us&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sacrifice. I had no intention of laying a hand on you guys, but we&#8217;ve had very little demon possession to collect lately.&#8221;</p>



<p>He takes a bottle of liquid from his pocket and holds it close to Alexia&#8217;s mouth.</p>



<p>It had a strong sweet smell.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then please have a good night&#8217;s sleep. Never to wake up again, to eternal sleep&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kuh&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia held her breath and turned her face away. Still, little by little, her consciousness faded away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alexia!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Clai&#8230;&#8230;re&#8221;</p>



<p>At that time.</p>



<p>There was a sound that sounded like something being forcibly torn apart.</p>



<p>The feeling that the world is being torn apart by a mighty pressure.</p>



<p>Then the ceiling cracks.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is this?&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian puts down the bottle and looks up.</p>



<p>A black shadow descended from the cracking ceiling.</p>



<p><em>TAP</em>.</p>



<p>A small, out-of-place landing sound echoes, and a black shadow rises.</p>



<p>&#8220;You are &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You are &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>A man stands in a white fog, wearing a long jet-black coat.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8221;Shadow&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>He pulled out his sword with a sway, letting his long coat hang in the air.</p>



<p>The head librarian held up a large machete with a grim look on his face.</p>



<p>&#8220;I never thought the Shadow would appear in person&#8230;&#8230;There should have been no report.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——You have bad hobby.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shadow took one look at the head librarian and said so.</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean by having bad hobby?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The way that you do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Indeed.&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian&#8217;s face contorted. Then he laughed as if despising himself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Life is not as you would expect it to be. I wander in its whirlpool and am broken. And I am living in a state of disgrace. If you say I have bad hobby, you are exactly right.&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian said in a calm voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;But it was worth the living shame.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Hou.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shadow. You are the end of my journey. A fitting end for a fool who has had his sword broken and betrayed his country.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Have you made up your mind?&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew this would happen from the moment Zenon was killed. At least, in my last moments, as a swordsman —— I&#8217;m going to fight.&#8221;</p>



<p>A large machete cleaves the fog and attacks Shadow.</p>



<p>——The swords are stacked against each other.</p>



<p>The words of the head librarian returned Alexia&#8217;s mind.</p>



<p>Indeed, his slashes shone beautifully.</p>



<p>&#8220;——Excellent.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shadow layered his sword on its brilliance.</p>



<p>If it&#8217;s just parrying then it&#8217;s good but.</p>



<p>The large machete becomes fragile, brittle, and shattered.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Shattered, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>The machete, reduced to its handle, made a lonely clank, clank sound.</p>



<p>Shadow waved his sword.</p>



<p>After a delay, the wind pressure of the slash drowned out the white fog.</p>



<p>The world is cracking. The whole area is covered with cracks with a creaking sound.</p>



<p>And the world cracked.</p>



<p>As if everything was an illusion, they return to our original world.</p>



<p>No, the head librarian who collapsed in a pool of blood proved that it was not an illusion.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shadow&#8230;&#8230; I guess it wasn&#8217;t even a match?&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian coughed and vomited up a clump of blood.</p>



<p>&#8220;——The peak is not yet in sight&#8221;</p>



<p>Shadow fluttered his jet-black long coat and disappeared.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s Shadow&#8217;s Sword.&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire muttered. The strength of the head librarian, who is quite a powerful man, kicked down without letting him do anything, made her tremble.</p>



<p>&#8220;He is getting stronger again&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia muttered in frustration.</p>



<p>Claire and Alexia worked together to break free of the restraints and stand up. Then they looked down at the head librarian.</p>



<p>&#8220;Head Librarian &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m already &#8230;&#8230; can&#8217;t be saved.&#8221;</p>



<p>He had a deep wound in his chest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you perhaps a famous magic swordsman?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia couldn&#8217;t help but ask. There was a beauty in his final blow that only the first-class could possess.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nope&#8230;&#8230; I am a nameless magic swordsman.&#8221;</p>



<p>He shook his head and replied.</p>



<p>Even Alexia knew it was a lie. Looking at his arms, she could still see the old scars.</p>



<p>&#8220;What about that arm&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was cut&#8230;&#8230;The technology of the cult has connected them, but they don&#8217;t work the way they used to anymore. In the past, I could use swords a bit more refined.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who cut you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;by Fenrir. My sword was broken that day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;May I ask what happened?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay &#8230;&#8230; I will tell you until my life is over.&#8221;</p>



<p>He says, looking down at the wound on his chest.</p>



<p>Alexia and Claire sat down beside him.</p>



<p>&#8220;That was about fifty years ago. That was when I was in the Knights of this country&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian looked up at the foggy night sky through the corridor window as if to recall a distant memory.</p>



<p>&#8220;I won the Bushin Festival and joined the Knights. I exposed injustice, caught the bad guys, and was promised a future career.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew you were a skilled magic swordsman&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I only had the momentum. So I found evidence of injustice that I should not have touched. I&#8217;m sure you are aware of the harmful pests that lurk in the Kingdom of Midgar &#8230;&#8230; No, all over the world. Princess Alexia must have noticed it, right&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s the Diabolos cult.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right. At the time I did not know about the existence of the Diabolos cult. So I mistakenly thought that the priests of the Holy Church were committing injustice, and I went to the church.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;To the church?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was still young. I believed that if I was right, all would be forgiven. I wanted to bring justice to the corrupt Holy Church.</p>



<p>Together with my subordinates, I investigated the church and tried to gather conclusive evidence of wrongdoing.</p>



<p>But &#8230;&#8230; ordinary priests had nothing to do with injustice. They just genuinely believed in the Holy Faith and spread the teachings.</p>



<p>The believers were the same. They were only pure, Holy Church believers to all intents and purposes.</p>



<p>Only a small percentage of the high-ranking priests were dishonest.</p>



<p>We patiently watched the priest and discovered a secret room in the basement of the church. We descended a long flight of stairs and found a horrifying sight.</p>



<p>A number of rotten demon-possessed people were in prison and moaning. They were wounded, and some had been implanted with something unidentifiable.</p>



<p>While we were stunned, the door behind us closed.</p>



<p>It was a trap.</p>



<p>I felt a killing intent and defended myself as quickly as I could.</p>



<p>Then I was hit by a tremendous impact and rolled on the floor.</p>



<p>When I got up, I saw my own left arm that had been cut off, the dead bodies of my subordinates who had been decapitated —— and the magic swordsman &#8220;Fenrir&#8221; standing in the center of it all.</p>



<p>I gripped my sword with my remaining right arm and angrily slashed at him. As a result, I lost my right arm as well.</p>



<p>The Diabolos cult was accustomed to eliminating &#8220;Ally of Justice&#8221; like myself.&#8221;</p>



<p>He dropped his gaze to the old scars carved into his arms.</p>



<p>It was overwhelming power. &#8220;Fenrir&#8221; brought a woman unconscious before me as I fell. She was my wife. As the winner of the Bushin Festival and a rising star in the Knights, I must have been of use to the cult. I sold my soul to the Diabolos cult in exchange for the safety of my wife&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; What happened to your wife? If she&#8217;s safe, I&#8217;ll take her into custody.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fortunately, my wife passed away without knowing anything about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t try to fight back?&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian shook his head sadly.</p>



<p>&#8220;The will to rebel has been severed with these two arms. Princess Alexia, please be careful. You are about to walk the same path as me. Beyond that lies despair and endless darkness.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia meets the head librarian&#8217;s steely gaze without looking away.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; But I must do it. As the princess of this country.&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian squinted as if see something bright.</p>



<p>&#8220;You have become a fine person. Then I&#8217;ll give you some final advice&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian coughed up blood from the corner of his mouth with a thin breath.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you know the purpose of the Diabolos cult &#8230;&#8230; Princess Alexia?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The resurrection of Demon Diabolos, right&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then why is the cult trying to resurrect the Demon Diabolos?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Etto, that&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia was at a loss for words.</p>



<p>Even though she knew of the cult&#8217;s goals, she had never thought about its motives.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are two reasons. One is to gain more power. All three heroes were women. All the demon-possessed were also women. The diabolos cells were only adapted to women. So the cult could only gain power through imperfect medicine.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, the head librarian took out a red pill from his pocket.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the drug used by Zenon.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s an inept disciple.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t use it&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a disgrace to magic swordsmen. &#8230;&#8230; But the cult saw the potential in this drug. They wanted to develop a complete medicine that would be effective and without side effects. That is why they have been studying the blood of heroes for many years. If they could revive the demon Diabolos, they would probably be able to complete it. They will have an overwhelming power that surpasses even heroes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That would be bad, right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But the second reason is more serious for the cult. You knew about the Diabolos Drops, didn&#8217;t you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Was it the drop that gives eternal life?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Only twelve drops can be taken each year. Drinking the &#8220;Hand of Diabolos&#8221; will stop aging for only one year. But now, these drops are decreasing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean decreasing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I do not know the cause. But if the amount continues to decrease, eternal life will be lost in the near future. For the highest executives of the cult, that was something they would never tolerate. They wanted to resurrect the demon Diabolos in order to collect a large amount of &#8220;Diabolos Drops&#8221; again and make eternal life complete. They have been ruling this world from the shadows, and have continued to be run by the highest executives with eternal life in their hands. However, if the &#8220;Diabolos Drop&#8221; is lost, this will be shaken&#8230;&#8230; Goho.&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian took a deep breath and looked up at the moon floating in the night sky.</p>



<p>&#8220;Perhaps it is no coincidence that the Shadow Garden appeared at this time. The beginning of the end, of a long reign. That is why you must be &#8230;&#8230; careful. Are they really &#8230;&#8230; the ally of justice that protects the peace of the world?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia could not answer.</p>



<p>All she knew about the Shadow Garden was that it was hostile to the Diabolos cult. Other than that, almost everything else was a mystery.</p>



<p>&#8220;Perhaps they are trying to steal from the cult&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Steal? What on earth?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eternal life &#8230;&#8230; And this world &#8230;&#8230;Goho, goho!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Head Librarian&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-After the cult fell&#8230; The world will be ruled&#8230;&#8230; by&#8230;&#8230; Shadow&#8230;&#8230; &nbsp;Garde&#8230;.. Goho&#8221;</p>



<p>The head librarian vomited a lot of blood.</p>



<p>&#8220;Head Librarian——!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;P-Princess Alexia&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>He takes a pained breath and weaves words.</p>



<p>&#8220;The future of this country&#8230;&#8230;I leave it to you&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>And the head librarian took his last breath.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>A beautiful woman with flaming red hair was examining the dead body of the head librarian.</p>



<p>She was Iris Midgar, princess of the Kingdom of Midgar and Alexia&#8217;s older sister. Alexia had sent Claire home first to explain the incident to the knights.</p>



<p>&#8220;Onee-sama, the head librarian told us the plans of the Diabolos cult on his deathbed. They kidnapped the students of the academy and the right arm of Diabolos, the demon sealed in this land——&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Enough.&#8221;</p>



<p>Iris interrupted Alexia&#8217;s words curtly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m tired of hearing that nonsense.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-Nonsense?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia asked back, dumbfounded.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alexia, listen. There is no such thing as the Diabolos cult.&#8221;</p>



<p>Iris looks at Alexia with serious eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;You said they don&#8217;t exist &#8230;&#8230; Onee-sama, what&#8217;s wrong? You promised to investigate the Diabolos cult with me&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;After investigating, we found out that there is no Diabolos cult.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was not Iris who said so.</p>



<p>He is a tall man standing next to her. His serpentine eyes and pale skin give off an eerie feeling.</p>



<p>&#8220;You are?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;First time to meet you, Princess Alexia. My name is Habu, Deputy Commander of the Crimson Knights.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s Glenn&#8217;s replacement. He&#8217;s a very talented and reliable man.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I am honored.&#8221;</p>



<p>Habu smiled thinly when Iris praised him.</p>



<p>&#8220;So what do you mean the Diabolos cult doesn&#8217;t exist? I think we have already gathered enough evidence.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shadow Garden fabricated the whole thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;F-Fabricated?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shadow Garden has committed many evil acts. Starting with the kidnapping of Princess Alexia, the attack on the school, the sabotage of the sanctuary, and the massacre in the Kingdom of Oriana. There have been reports of many other horrific acts around the world.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Therefore, it is the Diabolos cult that——!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shadow Garden fabricated an organization called the Diabolos cult to cover up their crimes. They created a criminal organization that does not exist in order to cover up their own evil.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you really think such wild logic is acceptable!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is the proof.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Habu handed the thick document to Alexia.</p>



<p>The cover of the book is labeled &#8220;The Fabrication of the Diabolos cult by the Shadow Garden.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thirty-four year old male confessed to acting as a member of the Diabolos cult at the direction of Shadow Garden. It appears that he was taken hostage by his family and had no choice but to comply. Twenty-eight-year-old female, kidnapped by Shadow Garden and forced to produce materials for the Diabolos cult. Fifty-seven-year-old male——&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t kidding me——!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia threw the material away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who can believe such a piece of paper! Isn&#8217;t this a fabrication!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Princess Alexia, you are not a very good listener. Do you think they are lying in their testimony?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can fabricate as many as you want, right!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course we have physical evidence. This one is by Shadow Garden——&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve had enough of this!&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia repelled Habu&#8217;s arm as he tried to hand her something.</p>



<p>Habu&#8217;s eyes narrowed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Onee-sama, please wake up. Why do you trust this man, look at me!&#8221;</p>



<p>Iris turned away from Alexia, who was clinging to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the one who needs to wake up, Alexia.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please, onee-sama. The right arm of Diabolos is about to be released!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You have been deceived by the Shadow Garden. All those you think are the Diabolos cult are a separate division of the Shadow Garden.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re wrong, onee-sama!! Please, listen to me!&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia extends her hand to Iris, who turns away.</p>



<p><em>PANG</em>.</p>



<p>Her hand was brushed away.</p>



<p>&#8220;No way&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My enemy is Shadow. Even if it is my little sister, I will show no mercy if you get in my way.&#8221;</p>



<p>She says so and leaves.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Crimson Knights are busy dealing with the Shadow Garden. If you&#8217;ll excuse me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Habu said with a triumphant face.</p>



<p>Alexia was stunned and looked away from her sister&#8217;s back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Princess Alexia&#8221;</p>



<p>When she called out and looked next to her, she saw a familiar face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Marco&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>He was an original member of the Crimson Knights. Although he is still young, he is trusted by Glen, and assumed that he would succeed Glen.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Princess Alexia.&#8221;</p>



<p>Marco says this without making eye contact, and then walks away.</p>



<p>&#8220;Marco &#8230;&#8230; you too?&#8221;</p>



<p>He did not answer the question. The knights carry away the dead body of the head librarian.</p>



<p>The forbidden book fell from Alexia&#8217;s hand.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>In the white fog, the golden tail was wagging.</p>



<p>&#8220;Lunlunlun~&#8221;</p>



<p>There is even an appropriate humming that can be heard.</p>



<p>Her light steps are like dancing. Pools of red blood spread around her, making a splashing sound.</p>



<p>&#8220;Zeta-sama, you&#8217;re in a good mood.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta&#8217;s humming stopped abruptly when she was called out.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now that was a good part.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Muu.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta twirled the bloodstained chakram around with her fingertips.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t throw it&#8221;</p>



<p>A small, hooded girl emerged from the white fog.</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t throw it. What about Viktoria?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The plan is proceeding.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A report from Viktoria-sama.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta, who was spinning the chakram, suddenly threw it into the air.</p>



<p><em>SPLAT</em>.</p>



<p>A man&#8217;s head came down from above. It cracks and crumbles with an expression of astonishment pasted on it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well done&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A report from Viktoria-sama.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems that Shadow-sama intervened in the matter of Princess Alexia and Claire.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Claire-&#8220;sama&#8221;, okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>The chakram slashed the wind and the girl&#8217;s hood shook.</p>



<p>&#8220;Forgive my rudeness.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Be careful. And what about Master?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He took care of the head librarian and got two of them out of the sanctuary.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As expected. With this, Fenrir was cornered.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. I think our next move is limited. What is your progress, Zeta-sama?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about the analysis of the sanctuary.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s done.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Already done? It&#8217;s only been a few days&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eta&#8217;s artifacts are excellent.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta then pulled out a mysterious device the size of the palm of her hand.</p>



<p>As she pours her magic power into it, the device glows thinly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Visualization of the magic circuit. See at a glance where it flows and what it means.&#8221;</p>



<p>The light spreads out like thin blood vessels. They pulsate and lead to a cylindrical red light.</p>



<p>In the four lights were the students of the school, connected to thin tubes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Trying to break the seal with their magic power.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Looks like the magic power is not enough.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. That is why they needed high quality, magic power of the descendants of heroes. How did the cult seal the Demon Diabolos and how did they create the sanctuary? I think I have a pretty good idea.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then we have no further use for them&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do we do? If we destroy this tube, we can protect the seal.&#8221;</p>



<p>When asked by the hooded girl, Zeta pondered for a moment.</p>



<p>But without even pondering, the answer was clear. She just wanted to make sure she was ready.</p>



<p>&#8220;We won&#8217;t destroy it &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve already made up my mind.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying that, Zeta walks out into the fog.</p>



<p>She passed through the red light and held her hand up to the huge door beyond.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ahead of this, the right arm of Demon Diabolos is sealed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you going to do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought I&#8217;d take a look at it to commemorate the occasion.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want a signature?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine too. Zeta has come.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta then poured magic into the door.</p>



<p>The door is inscribed with countless ancient letters, and thick chains are wrapped around it in layers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Will it open?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. But she&#8217;s the one who sealed the demon&#8217;s right arm in this place.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll respond.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta pours in more magic power.</p>



<p>Then the door begins to glow red and a magic circuit spreads through the space. The sound of creaking chains can be heard, and the door is seen shaking slightly.</p>



<p>But the door did not open.</p>



<p>The magic circuit concentrates in front of the door, shaping the human figure with its veiny, thin light.</p>



<p>&#8220;Step back.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>At Zeta&#8217;s command, the hooded girl moves away.</p>



<p>Eventually, when the faint light disappeared, there stood a beastwoman.</p>



<p>Golden hair, golden cat ears, a golden tail, and cat-like eyes. The figure looked very similar to that of Zeta.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The hooded girl gasped.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nice to meet you, Beastwoman Hero.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Zeta-sama, what is this&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because I knew it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta said nonchalantly.</p>



<p>At that moment, the beastwoman hero slashed her claws and cut off Zeta&#8217;s neck.</p>



<p>Zeta&#8217;s head, which had flown widely through the air, disappeared as a black mist. At the same time, Zeta&#8217;s torso also disappeared.</p>



<p>A white fog mixed with a black fog, from which an unharmed Zeta appeared.</p>



<p>She floated in the air, looking down at the beastwoman hero with her cold eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;But I just wanted to make sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta said that.</p>



<p>The beastwoman hero did not respond. She just looked up at Zeta with emotionless eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you remember the day you first met Master?&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta asked the hooded girl as she kept floating.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. I&#8217;ll never forget it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The hooded girl said so, clutching her chest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Me too. I never forgot that day.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta stared intently at the beastwoman hero. Beyond her figure, as if remembering the distant past.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m —— a tiny little kitten that was picked up by Master&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Zeta&#8217;s determination.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bye Bye Hero. I&#8217;m going down a different path than you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta turned on her heel.</p>



<p>The little hooded girl hurriedly follows.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you fine with that? You have not gotten the signature yet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn. The signature will be done another time. The current stage goal has been achieved. All that remains is to lurk in the shadows until the time is right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then let us lurk in the shadows.&#8221;</p>



<p>The two girls exchanged words as they disappeared into the fog.</p>



<p>The beastwoman hero stared at their back.</p>
