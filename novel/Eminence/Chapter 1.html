<h1 class="has-text-align-center">Chapter 1: Nee-san&#8217;s Return and Progression of Disease&#8230;&#8230;!</h1>

<p>The next day, the school was in an uproar about last night&#8217;s fight between Zeta and Delta.</p>



<p>&#8220;Last night, it seems there was a tremendous amount of magic power detected in the back of the dormitory.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems, I was sleeping so I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was sleeping, too, so I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hyoro and Jaga were talking with troubled look on their faces.</p>



<p>&#8220;I heard they&#8217;re checking the scene&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It looks like. Some of the teachers were there to help.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The back of the dormitory is the crime scene, which means they must have intended to break into the women&#8217;s dormitory. The culprit must be a pervert.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it looks like the back of the men&#8217;s dormitory is the crime scene.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mu, then they were going to break into the men&#8217;s dormitory.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is their purpose?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because there&#8217;s a handsome guy here.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hyoro said with a dirty smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right. There is a handsome man here too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jaga also said with a dirty smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess so.&#8221;</p>



<p>I agreed with the usual expression on my face.</p>



<p>Aside from these two, the other students seem to be talking rather seriously about last night&#8217;s incident. They have various theories, such as that it was committed by someone with a grudge against the school, that a valuable artifact in the laboratory was the target, or that it is related to the missing case in question.</p>



<p>Sorry guys.</p>



<p>The truth is, it&#8217;s just a dog and cat fight. But I don&#8217;t dislike the atmosphere of some incident going on behind the peaceful school life.</p>



<p>&#8220;The next class is in the exercise room, so let&#8217;s get moving.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, Sid, you&#8217;ve got some nerve leaving this handsome guy here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait a minute, the handsome guy is getting ready.&#8221;</p>



<p>I leave them alone and move on.</p>



<p>But last night, it was great to hit Alexia with the Eminence in Shadow move on the spur of the moment.</p>



<p>The horrific battle that unfolds on the other side of the peaceful school and me worrying about its fate. The ability to improvise and the realistic direction using the battle between Zeta and Delta were high art points.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I show my ability and appeal that the world we live in is a very different place.</p>



<p>In the underworld conflict, the people from the front only get in the way ―― an ironclad stylish direction that has been in place since BC.</p>



<p>Just thinking about it makes me smile.</p>



<p>My idea of the best &#8220;Eminence in Shadow&#8221; will be etched in the history of this world.</p>



<p>&#8220;Master&#8221;</p>



<p>I wonder if it&#8217;s my imagination, but I hear Zeta&#8217;s voice from somewhere.</p>



<p>&#8220;Master, over here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oops.&#8221;</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t my imagination.</p>



<p>I thought a girl wearing a janitor&#8217;s uniform was grabbing my uniform, but it was Zeta.</p>



<p>For some reason she is dressed in a work uniform, wearing a knit hat and covering her ears.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, and why are you dressed like that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Disguise, infiltration&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta sticks close to me and says it simply.</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop marking me, it will stand out.&#8221;</p>



<p>There are other students in the hallway.</p>



<p>&#8220;Master, you dog smelly.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;When Zeta sticks to me, it will be cat smelly.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Muuh.&#8221;</p>



<p>I tore off Zeta with my elbow.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, what about Delta?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve scattered her. By now she&#8217;s on the sea.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s not get into the details.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta, who seriously escaped, is difficult to catch. That&#8217;s why she can fight with Delta.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn, over here.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta pulled me by the hand and took me into an empty classroom.</p>



<p>The air in the empty classroom was cold and dusty, probably because it had not been used for a while.</p>



<p>&#8220;The next class is about to start.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I report&#8221;</p>



<p>She snuggles up and whispers in my ear.</p>



<p>Apparently, she wants to continue playing spy.</p>



<p>&#8220;The attack on her failed&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I bet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But she&#8217;s still on the other side.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Cult will send the next assassin.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta moved to the window and looked out.</p>



<p>I also stood next to her and we both moved to look down out the window. In the distance I could see the Knights and teachers conducting last night&#8217;s site inspection.</p>



<p>Zeta stared at them with her purple eyes.</p>



<p>I imitated her and stared at them too.</p>



<p>&#8220;Probably him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Him, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s dangerous, I&#8217;ll intervene&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll leave the decision to you.&#8221;</p>



<p>At that moment, Zeta quickly bent down.</p>



<p>I also imitated her and bent down.</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s searched&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Guess there&#8217;s a guy with good instincts.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn, lurking in the shadows.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I hid and looked outside, I felt a gaze from a distance for a moment.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is he looking at&#8230;&#8230;Oops, I have to go now.&#8221;</p>



<p>The bell rang.</p>



<p>Looking back, Zeta was nowhere to be found.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>


<p>Lunch break.</p>



<p>I was standing in line at the cafeteria with Hyoro and Jaga.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, what shall I have for lunch today?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid&#8217;s lucky he&#8217;s got the money he stole from us to have a lavish lunch.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid-kun, you&#8217;re lucky, we have a daily set meal of 980 Zenny, the poor noble course, it is tough you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like to hear people say I stole it from them. It&#8217;s my right.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the money I took from the two of them is to fund activities for the &#8220;Eminence in Shadow&#8221;. Wasting it in a place like this will hinder my future activities.</p>



<p>I am the type of person who keeps my priorities in order.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s take the 980 Zenny Poor Noble course again today. Believe that daily savings will lead to success later.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s been a while, otouto-kun.&#8221; <em>(TLN: little brother)</em></p>



<p>At that moment, a voice called out to me from behind.</p>



<p>There is only one person in the world who calls me &#8220;otouto-kun&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nina-senpai, long time no see.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her wine-red hair is still silky today.</p>



<p>Her uniform is boldly open down to her chest, and her slender legs stretch out from her short skirt. What a challenging fashion style.</p>



<p>She is Nina, a senior in the third grade.</p>



<p>&#8220;Where were you during winter break? Claire was looking for you. And it was tough for me to accompany her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, there is various stuff.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm. Various stuff.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nina-senpai cut the line in front of me.</p>

<p>She is very petite. Her head is at about the level of my chest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t cut in line&#8221;</p>



<p>When I tried to tap her shoulder, she easily avoided it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Today, otouto-kun is still having the daily set meal of 980 zenny, the poor noble course, huh. Your living is so tight.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m saving for big ambitions for the future, not living tight.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. I&#8217;ll treat you, what do you want?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The most expensive one, then.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay. Two Deluxe Lunch 100,000 zenny Super Rich Noble Courses.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nina-senpai ordered the finest lunch.</p>



<p>She is my sister&#8217;s best friend, and perhaps because of that, she treats me well. She is a very helpful senior who will do anything for me if I ask her to.</p>



<p>I once jokingly said I wanted to read a forbidden book from the library and she really brought it to me. How she prepared it is still a mystery to me. She has also been a great help to me in many other ways.</p>



<p>When I met Nina-senpai, I was glad for the first time that I was my sister&#8217;s brother.</p>



<p>&#8220;P-Please treat me too!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Me too, me too!&#8221;</p>



<p>Hyoro and Jaga are slightly intimidated by Nina-senpai&#8217;s aura, but still cling to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;I gave you guys the cards, right&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;R-R-R-Right!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-T-T-Thank you for the cards the other day!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not really. Claire caused trouble after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>That seems to be the case.</p>



<p>We secured a first-class seat by the window through the power of Nina-senpai.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, sit down.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hoi&#8221;</p>



<p>I started eating the super rich noble course next to Nina-senpai, and Hyoro and Jaga started eating the poor noble course across from me, looking frightened.</p>



<p>The super rich noble course starts with appetizers. The maid prepares them with great skill.</p>



<p>&#8220;Looks like Claire is missing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Senpai says while eating the appetizer carpaccio.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right&#8221;</p>



<p>I also eat carpaccio. I don&#8217;t know what kind of fish it is, but it&#8217;s really good.</p>



<p>&#8220;Princess Alexia asked me earlier if I knew anything about it, but I&#8217;m pretty sure it was a normal day and I have no idea what happened. What about you, otouto-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know anything either. Alexia is looking for her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Something is bothering her. I&#8217;m a little worried too, since there seems to be another student missing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And it looks like there was a commotion last night.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s behind the boys&#8217; dormitory, isn&#8217;t it? That&#8217;s pretty disturbing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, I also saw the Crimson Knights near the site. Looks like they&#8217;re adding more personnel, but I&#8217;m not sure about the quality.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He~eh, you know a lot.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, yeah~&#8221;</p>



<p>Nina-senpai winks proudly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you going to be a knight when you graduate, Nina-senpai?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. Unlike Claire, I don&#8217;t have very good grades.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Is that so.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You look surprised. It&#8217;s well-known that I have bad grades.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What, I thought you were at the top of your class.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hahaha, I think Claire will be at the top of the class this year. Her recent growth has been spectacular. I&#8217;m just a dropout.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess we&#8217;ll leave it at that&#8221;</p>



<p>Seemingly at ease with her aloofness, Nina-senpai brought the soup to her little mouth.</p>



<p>From the looks of it, Nina-senpai is supposed to be stronger than nee-san. Well, people have their own reasons for hiding their abilities. Nina-senpai is also a rather mysterious person.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll let you know if there is any progress on Claire&#8217;s case. You&#8217;re worried, aren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Worried? No, not really&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s a lie, I&#8217;m very worried.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re as usual. Well, I guess there&#8217;s no need to worry about Claire. Let me know if you need any help.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nina-senpai smiled cutely.</p>



<p>Hyoro and Jaga ate the daily set meal 980 zenny poor noble course in silence.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;Hey, can we get out of here yet?&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire let out a sigh in the classroom at the school.</p>



<p>The surroundings were shrouded in white fog and there was no sign of people.</p>



<p>[A little more.]</p>



<p>&#8220;It has been quite a while since you said that.&#8221;</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m saying a little more. Right now we are widening the gap. Your magic is low and it takes time.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I am sorry my magic is low. Even like this, I belong to the one that has a large in school.&#8221;</p>



<p>[What a low level]</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so annoying.&#8221;</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m sorry, I said my mind unconsciously.]</p>



<p>&#8220;So, what&#8217;s a gap?&#8221;</p>



<p>[A gap to return to the original world]</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean by the original world? What is this world in the first place?&#8221;</p>



<p>[I won&#8217;t tell~]</p>



<p>Again Claire let out a sigh. So many things she doesn&#8217;t understand.</p>



<p>She sits down at a desk and is about to cross her legs when she notices something strange.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Something was touching her leg.</p>



<p>Looking closer, it was a translucent human arm. The bloody arm was holding Claire&#8217;s leg.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What is this!&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire stands up, kicks the arm and steps back.</p>



<p>A bloody human appeared, as if pulled from the arm that had been kicked off.</p>



<p>He has dark skin, sunken eyes, and a deep scar across his chest.</p>



<p>No matter how you look at it, he&#8217;s a dead man.</p>



<p>[Be careful, it&#8217;s a ghost.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Ghosts?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Heroes of the past bound to this land. Bound by negative magic, wandering in perpetual time. Free him.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if you tell me to free him&#8230;&#8230;How?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Maybe you should just hit him.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Humph.&#8221;</p>



<p>When the ghost got up, Claire hit it with a fist filled with magic power.</p>



<p>The ghost explodes and disappears.</p>



<p>&#8220;What a nasty feeling&#8221;</p>



<p>[The appearance of the ghosts is a sign that the seal is weakening &#8230;&#8230; Hey, this isn&#8217;t good.]</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean, &#8220;seal&#8221;?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Ah, I was just talking to myself. I screwed up, I have to make sure you can&#8217;t hear me. Even though she has little magic power, she only has good hearing.]</p>



<p>&#8220;I can hear you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then Aurora fell silent.</p>



<p>Claire kicked the ghost away as it reappeared.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little discouraging not having a sword.&#8221;</p>



<p>She left her sword on the other side.</p>



<p>Kicking away the ghosts that appeared from time to time, Claire waited for Aurora to finish her work.</p>



<p>The frequency of the ghosts gradually increases, and the fog thickens accordingly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aurora, is it done yet?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Just a little more.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s true. But too bad&#8230;&#8230;You have a visitor.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>She felt a presence and turned around, and before she knew it, a man in a black robe was standing.</p>



<p>He hides his face with a black mask.</p>



<p>&#8220;When did you&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire takes a half-swinging stance, but it is awkward due to not having a sword.</p>



<p>On the other hand, the man in the black robe held his sword in a familiar manner and instantly he was in close range of Claire.</p>



<p>&#8220;So fas――!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire just barely avoided the first blow and kept her distance.</p>



<p>But the man in the black robe did not allow it. A preemptive sword strikes Claire.</p>



<p>&#8220;Guh.&#8221;</p>



<p>Blown away, Claire gets up on wobbly legs.</p>



<p>She received a strong hit from the back of the sword, but she is still able to fight.</p>



<p>Apparently, the other party doesn&#8217;t intend to kill her. Does he intend to capture her?</p>



<p>[You&#8217;re going to lose.]</p>



<p>Aurora&#8217;s voice echoes in her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shut up for a second. This is crucial.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Is that so? I can see the results.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Shut up, if only I had a sword&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s impossible even if you have a sword.]</p>



<p>&#8220;I said shut up!&#8221;</p>



<p>[They&#8217;re coming.]</p>



<p>At that moment, the black-robed man kicks the ground and closes the gap.</p>



<p>[I&#8217;ll lend you my strength.]</p>



<p>&#8220;――Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was just a moment.</p>



<p>A red tentacle shot out at the black-robed man who was right in front of her.</p>



<p>Red tentacles extend from Claire&#8217;s feet, writhing like living creatures.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What&#8217;s this?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Blood]</p>



<p>&#8220;Blood?!&#8221;</p>



<p>[If you work hard, you can do it. Because you are&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; What am I?&#8221;</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s nothing. It&#8217;s not over yet.]</p>



<p>Claire raised her head and saw a man in black robes standing there.</p>



<p>He was bleeding from the cheek and his black mask was off.</p>



<p>&#8220;You are, from a Knights&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>His face was one she had seen before at a knight&#8217;s trial.</p>



<p>&#8220;Long time no see. Claire-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then he smiles and takes a bow.</p>



<p>&#8220;Third Order of Knights, Captain of the Fourth Squad, Viscount Jean.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It is a disguise. I am Jean of Named Children &#8216;Dark Smile&#8217;.'&#8221;</p>



<p>What&#8217;s up with that name?</p>



<p>Claire thought, but did not say it out loud.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s Named Children or what, but I didn&#8217;t realize you had such a lousy side job.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I, too, had no idea that Claire had this kind of power. Interesting &#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m sure you didn&#8217;t have it when I looked it up before.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Before?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That is just our talk here. Either way, I&#8217;ll need to do another detailed check on you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, he holds up his sword.</p>



<p>Claire&#8217;s red tentacles also tried to get into a fighting stance, but for some reason, they melted away powerlessly.</p>



<p>[This is bad, Claire.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m about to run out of magic.]</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire&#8217;s lips twitched.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m lucky. I have a souvenir for that person.&#8221;</p>



<p>The &#8220;Dark Smile&#8221; lived up to his name with a dark smile.</p>



<p>At that time, <em>parin</em>.</p>



<p>The sound of breaking glass echoed, and part of the white foggy world cracked.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Through the cracks, a figure descends.</p>



<p>It is a beautiful beastman girl in a jet-black body suit with golden ears and tail.</p>



<p>She landed in front of Claire and shot a mysterious black mist that hit the sword of the &#8220;Dark Smile&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Guuh.&#8221;</p>



<p>The &#8220;Dark Smile&#8221; was blown away with tremendous force.</p>



<p>It looked as if it was only a small bullet. But what is this power?</p>



<p>A beastman girl clad in black mist, stands with a cold stare.</p>



<p>&#8220;You are&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Zeta&#8221;</p>



<p>She said so in a cold voice.</p>



<p>[Step back, Claire. That girl, I can&#8217;t see the end of her power.]</p>



<p>Aurora&#8217;s voice echoed in her head.</p>



<p>Claire was surprised to hear her unusually tense voice.</p>



<p>She steps back and asks.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it correct to say that you helped me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right now, we can&#8217;t hand you over to the cult.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>The black fog shimmered, and the next thing she knew, Zeta was standing behind her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Bye Bye&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire is grabbed by the neck and thrown directly into the cracks of the world.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, what are you doiiiing!&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire&#8217;s screams fade away, swallowed by the cracks.</p>



<p>And Zeta and &#8220;Dark Smile&#8221; Jean were left in a world of white fog.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tch&#8230;&#8230;How dare you interrupt me.&#8221;</p>



<p>The &#8220;Dark Smile&#8221; is facing Zeta.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn, nice to meet you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew you&#8217;d show up, Shadow Garden.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, &#8220;Dark Smile&#8221; holds up a sword.</p>



<p>Zeta looked boredly as the &#8220;Dark Smile&#8221; carefully measured their distance.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so relaxed. Are you Shadow Garden&#8217;s executive class?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you notice it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta&#8217;s reply is selfish.</p>



<p>Because she knows she is the absolute strong one.</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Her secret&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You mean that power? Does it matt――!?&#8221;</p>



<p>In that instant, Zeta&#8217;s magic power swelled.</p>



<p>The knees of &#8220;Dark Smile&#8221; tremble with the magic power that seems to crush him.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-Wha&#8230;&#8230;What is that magic power&#8230;&#8230;Did you conceal it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you didn&#8217;t know, I would have let you go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talki――?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Once you know, goodbye.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What does that mean&#8230;&#8230;UUUuUUUU!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, the &#8220;Dark Smile&#8221; shed black tears.</p>



<p>In addition, black mist erupts from his pores and his body bursts into pieces.</p>



<p>Zeta glances at the corpse and mutters.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn. New technique, not bad.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then she turned around and spoke to the empty space.</p>



<p>&#8220;Done.&#8221;</p>



<p>As if in response to her words, a girl emerges from a crack in the space.</p>



<p>A beautiful pink-blonde girl in a jet-black bodysuit. She is Viktoria.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, Zeta-sama.&#8221;</p>



<p>She kneels in front of Zeta.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have identified Aurora in Claire-sama.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess that&#8217;s what it was&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn. It&#8217;s all connected. That&#8217;s why Master&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is the cult aware of it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, what&#8217;s the plan?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Switch to Plan C&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think Claire-sama is the key to our plan. But it is our most desirable future.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Master said. Discern the future.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s Shadow-sama&#8217;s intention&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Viktoria folds her hands over her chest and prays.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tell her, too. Tell her we&#8217;ve changed our plans.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta disappeared as a black mist, and Viktoria smiled thinly as she watched her go.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>

<p>The only sound in the classroom was the sound of pens running over answer sheets.</p>



<p>I wrinkle my eyebrows and stare at the test paper.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>



<p>As the end-of-grade tests approach, the quizzes in class will increase.</p>



<p>If you get a red mark on this quiz, you will be given a special assignment, but this special assignment is tricky and requires a tremendous amount of work.</p>



<p>Teachers are desperate to keep the idiots from failing.</p>



<p>I have avoided red marks so far, just barely, like a mob.</p>



<p>By cheating, of course.</p>



<p>But the price for relying too much on cheating has kicked in.</p>



<p>——Isaac-kun was absent.</p>



<p>Isaac-kun was the best student in the class, and he was right at the angle where I could see his answer sheet from my seat.</p>



<p>In other words, it is no exaggeration to say that he is a student who was born on purpose to be cheated by me, and thanks to him, I was able to adjust the scores in a divine way.</p>



<p>And that Isaac-kun is unexpectedly absent!</p>



<p>Thanks to that, I am in danger of getting a red mark.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kuh&#8230; &#8220;</p>



<p>When it comes to cheating, it&#8217;s all about whose answers you look at. There is no point in looking at an idiot&#8217;s answer.</p>



<p>Looking to the right, Hyoro is acting suspiciously, his gaze wandering.</p>



<p>This guy is useless.</p>



<p>I looked to my left and saw Jaga looking under his desk at a suspicious angle.</p>



<p>This guy is useless too.</p>



<p>Is the only one I can rely on now the Duke&#8217;s daughter, Christina-san who is diagonally in front of me?</p>



<p>She is one of the top five honor students in the class, but there is one drawback.</p>



<p>From my angle, more than half of the answer sheet is hidden.</p>



<p>I have already copied down the answers within my view.</p>



<p>However, this would be 40 points at best. It is not enough to get 60 points to avoid a red mark.</p>



<p>Should I move to a position where I can see the answer sheet and copy it?</p>



<p>However, even if the presence disappears, the body does not disappear. If I move in this bright, unobstructed space, I am normally visible even if there is no presence.</p>



<p>There are many eyes in the class, and they will definitely find out.</p>



<p>If that is the case, I will have no choice but to move at a speed that no one else can see.</p>



<p>This is possible.</p>



<p>I can afford it if I get serious.</p>



<p>But there is one major drawback.</p>



<p>If I move too fast to be seen, the wind pressure will blow through me.</p>



<p>The answer sheet might blow up.</p>



<p>No, rather, Christina-san might be blown away.</p>



<p>This will make me losing everything.</p>



<p>Then I would have to move so delicately that I would not generate wind pressure, and so fast that I would not be seen.</p>



<p>I had no idea that a mere quiz would require such a high level of skill.</p>



<p>I wonder if I can do it&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>I have done a lot of fast-moving training in my life. But I had never trained to move fast without wind pressure.</p>



<p>Special assignments are so annoying that two days off can be lost.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Let&#8217;s do it&#8221;</p>



<p>If I give up at a place like this, it&#8217;ll break the mob&#8217;s name.</p>



<p>I formed a fine magic power that no one would notice.</p>



<p>Right off the bat, eat this.</p>



<p>At that moment——.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi, there! What are you doing!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——!?&#8221;</p>



<p>They found out?!</p>



<p>My magic power fades away in surprise.</p>



<p>But the teacher didn&#8217;t look at me.</p>



<p>The teacher is looking right next to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hyoro Gari! You cheated, right!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I didn&#8217;t look it!! I didn&#8217;t look at Christina-san&#8217;s answer!!&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Hyoro, who was pale and shaking.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hou, I&#8217;m surprised you even confessed. I&#8217;ve been watching you since a while ago. Now leave, and I&#8217;ll double your special assignment.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No way&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>With a lifeless look on his face, Hyoro walked out.</p>



<p>Christina-san was looking at Hyoro as if she were looking at garbage.</p>



<p>N-Now, let&#8217;s get back on track.</p>



<p>I cast a fine magic power —— at that moment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi, there! What are you doing!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Again!?</p>



<p>I raised my head in surprise, but the teacher didn&#8217;t look at me.</p>



<p>The teacher was looking at the one who is next to me again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Jaga Imo!! What are you looking at under the table!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I-I-I-I-I-I-I didn&#8217;t look it!! I didn&#8217;t see any cheat sheet under my desk!!&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Jaga who was breaking out in a waterfall of cold sweat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hou, honesty is nice. Leave the room. I&#8217;ll triple your special assignment.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-It&#8217;s increasing&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>With unsteady steps, Jaga walked out.</p>



<p>&#8220;Next person who is caught cheating gets a special assignment quadruple.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, the teacher keep a close eye on us.</p>



<p>Damn you, Hyoro and Jaga, doing something unnecessary.</p>



<p>The risk has jumped because of these guys. Teacher are also more vigilant.</p>



<p>——But.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Compromise is unacceptable&#8221;</p>



<p>Kneading my magic power.</p>



<p>Time seems to move slower.</p>



<p>Maybe I can do it now.</p>



<p>The Phantom Mob-style Depths Specialized in Cheating-——49th!!</p>



<p>&#8220;Watch carefully——&#8221;</p>



<p>I focused all my nerves, then. There was a thud and something was falling.</p>



<p>It seems that when something so unexpected happens, people are speechless.</p>



<p>Somehow, all of a sudden, Claire nee-san fell on top of the teacher. The whole class was stunned, looking at nee-san.</p>



<p>I never thought my sister would go this far either. I didn&#8217;t expect her disappearance to be foreshadowing for this&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean you can&#8217;t hand me over!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Nee-san stands up, stomping on the teacher, and shouts into the empty space.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tell me! The special powers I have——!&#8221;</p>



<p>Nee-san suddenly looked around the classroom restlessly and became serious.</p>



<p>&#8220;Claire Kagenou. This is not your class.&#8221;</p>



<p>The trampled teacher squeezes out a strained voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, etto, that&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; Eeh.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nee-san turned bright red and made a face that I couldn&#8217;t tell whether she was smiling or twitching.</p>



<p>&#8220;M-My apologies! I&#8217;m sorry!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Then, quickly bowing, she turns and exits in a great hurry.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m sure she&#8217;ll get a call back later.</p>



<p>Falling from the sky, speaking to empty space, claiming to have special powers —— the disease seems to be progressing more than I can imagine.</p>



<p>But this time it helped me.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Thanks to nee-san for getting all the attention.&#8221;</p>



<p>I smiled as I filled in the blanks on my answer sheet.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>


<p>Claire let out a small sigh as she left the student guidance office.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been through a lot of trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>The sermon by the Head Teacher lasted for an hour, and the light shining into the corridor was tinged with dusky red.</p>



<p>The voices of the students can be heard in the distance.</p>



<p>Claire&#8217;s footsteps echo through the empty hallway.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of all the places, to be in Sid&#8217;s class. What kind of face should I make from tomorrow?&#8221;</p>



<p>She speaks to the empty space with blushing cheeks.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s all your fault.&#8221;</p>



<p>[How cruel. Even though it&#8217;s not my fault.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Then tell me what happened. If I told them that I was attacked by a strange man in a strange space and fell on top of a teacher, they wouldn&#8217;t believe me. I almost got referred to a doctor.&#8221;</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s better not to know. Once you know, you won&#8217;t be able to go back.]</p>



<p>&#8220;You know what? There is no way I can be ignorant of something like this after what happened, right. I&#8217;m angry.&#8221;</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;No. I can&#8217;t put you in danger.]</p>



<p>&#8220;I am already in danger. If you won&#8217;t talk, I&#8217;ll find out myself. I definitely won&#8217;t let it end like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>[It&#8217;s useless.]</p>



<p>&#8220;I am the one who decides if it&#8217;s useless or not. Witch of Calamity, Aurora-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>[That name, where did you&#8230;&#8230;?]</p>



<p>&#8220;I looked it up——&#8221;</p>



<p>After saying that much, Claire suddenly stopped.</p>



<p>Before she knew it, a silver-haired girl was in the hallway where she had thought no one was.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry to interrupt your self-talk, Claire Kagenou-san. I need to talk to you for a moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>She looked at Claire with red eyes and interest. It was Alexia Midgar, princess of the Kingdom of Midgar.</p>



<p>Claire&#8217;s face became stern.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not self-talking.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nobody&#8217;s here, though?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia looks around purposefully.</p>



<p>Claire&#8217;s face became even stern.</p>



<p>&#8220;Princess Alexia, I have no intention of having a friendly chat with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am hated. I thought we&#8217;ve never met, Claire-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to talk to the damn princess who cajoled Sid.&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire&#8217;s eyes became so sharp that she could kill a person.</p>



<p>Or rather, she was completely gunned her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ha? There was a reason for that! I didn&#8217;t mean to cajole him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia looks a little impatient and her eyes swim.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haan? You&#8217;re upset. I smell a liar.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re rude, I won&#8217;t do it! Or rather, what&#8217;s with that attitude! You&#8217;re his sister and I was trying to be polite with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew it, a liar and wolf in sheep&#8217;s clothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Claire spits it out, Alexia clicks her tongue.</p>



<p>&#8220;After all, you&#8217;re siblings. You are so alike in your rudeness.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, I sound like Sid?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yes. The rude part is &#8230;&#8230; &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8230; We look alike &#8230;&#8230; Ehehe&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire laughs as if a flower has bloomed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You have a good eye!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Etto&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia is puzzled by the firm grip on her shoulders.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, what do you want to talk about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, but&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m busy right now, but okay, I don&#8217;t have a choice. I&#8217;ll listen to you for a minute.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, do you see any other resemblances between me and Sid?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;L-Like, black hair&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>They walked shoulder to shoulder down the hallway at dusk.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;Here is?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a special reception room reserved for high-ranking people.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia said as she lit up the luxurious room.</p>



<p>&#8220;High-ranking people?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am royalty, after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, now that you mention it.&#8221;</p>



<p>This girl had forgotten it, Alexia thought.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please, sit down.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nice material. Beautiful embroidery. What a waste of taxpayer money.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t people say you say too many words?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve never been told.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia and Claire sat on the big soft sofa as they argued.</p>



<p>Just two people in a large room.</p>



<p>Alexia looked again at Claire, who was facing her.</p>



<p>With black hair and red eyes, she is an honor student in both the literary and military arts.</p>



<p>It is rumored that she has been rapidly improving her abilities recently, and she has been unofficially accepted into the Order of the Knights.</p>



<p>I see, except that she is rude, not unlike that brother.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s up with the serious face?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to have a serious talk.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know. I won&#8217;t give you Sid.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I don&#8217;t want him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia covers up her raised voice with a cough.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about falling on top of a teacher in class.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What, a sermon?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to hear what happened.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I made a big jump with my magic power from outside the classroom and attacked the teacher. I think I went crazy from stress. I don&#8217;t know, but that&#8217;s what happened. I&#8217;m sorry for what I did.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a clean monotone voice, Claire said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t want to hear such insincere talk&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wrote it exactly as I just said in my reflection.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But it&#8217;s really different, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;ve been researching the Devil Diabolos.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, Alexia spread the materials she had retrieved in Claire&#8217;s room on the desk.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s my&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not looking into this as a hobby, right&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; What do you want to know?&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire&#8217;s face became serious.</p>



<p>&#8220;Everything. I need to know what&#8217;s going on in this academy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; You won&#8217;t make fun of me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I won&#8217;t. Absolutely.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really.&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire was silent and looked away.</p>



<p>She just stared at the empty space. Her eyes seemed to be talking to someone.</p>



<p>After a moment, she shook her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry, Aurora.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia tilts her head at the out of context words.</p>



<p>But Claire was not talking to Alexia. Just staring into the emptiness.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m at my limit. I don&#8217;t know anything, and I&#8217;m worried&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire&#8217;s shoulders were shaking slightly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then she says so and laughs a little.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not okay at all&#8230;&#8230; So I&#8217;m going to spill it all. I know it sounds silly, but believe it or not, it&#8217;s your choice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I believe you.&#8221;</p>



<p>To Alexia, it didn&#8217;t look like Claire was trying to lie.</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? Well, let me introduce you to her first.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Her?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Her name is Aurora. She is a ghost called the Witch of Calamity. Say hello.&#8221;</p>



<p>There was no one in the place Claire pointed to.</p>



<p>Even though she stared and rubbed her eyes, she couldn&#8217;t see anything.</p>



<p>&#8220;I met her when——&#8221;</p>



<p>Seeing Claire speak as if there were someone else there, Alexia felt a little regret that she had said she believed her.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;——And that&#8217;s so&#8221;</p>



<p>By the time Claire finished telling the whole story, the sun was already setting.</p>



<p>As the fire in the fireplace crackles, Alexia takes a sip of her coffee and takes a breath.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I have a rough idea of the situation.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you believe me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. It may be a crazy story, but they&#8217;re connected.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Connected?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes —— Everything is connected. The Shadow Garden, the Diabolos cult, and the events happening at this school. It&#8217;s a little hard to believe in ghosts, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Aurora is really here! She&#8217;s still sitting next to me laughing!&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia glanced at the empty sofa.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s put the ghost aside for now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I told you, she&#8217;s really here!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But the name sounds familiar. The Witch of Calamity, Aurora. The Diabolos cult leader mentioned her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is the Diabolos cult related to Aurora?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know. I have looked into it, but there is very little documentation of the Witch of Calamity. The only thing I know is that she once brought great calamity.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aurora, have you brought great calamity?&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire talks to the ghost next to her.</p>



<p>She seems to be having a conversation.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuhn Fuhn, that&#8217;s what it is. Aurora says she was the one who exterminated the pig orcs. She said she was physiologically unable to do it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;I think that&#8217;s probably wrong.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it wrong? Fuhn Fuhn, I see. Aurora says she was the one who scratched doodles on the holy shield Aegis. She didn&#8217;t know it was such a famous shield.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Absolutely wrong! In the first place, the holy shield Aegis was lost and has yet to be found&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see, is this wrong too? Well, then——&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——That&#8217;s enough of that story for now! Let&#8217;s move on to the next topic.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But Aurora says there are more tales to tell.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Enough, let&#8217;s get back to the main issue!&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia clears her throat.</p>



<p>&#8220;First, what we need to clarify is the incident that is happening at the school.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire made a serious face.</p>



<p>&#8220;The mysterious space that Claire is trapped in, but I&#8217;ve had similar experiences myself. In the Sanctuary——&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia explained what she had experienced in the sanctuary.</p>



<p>&#8220;——That&#8217;s definitely a resemblance.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a phenomenon going on at the academy that&#8217;s very similar to the &#8220;Sanctuary&#8221;. And Claire fought against the &#8220;Dark Smile&#8221; or whatever he is called. Probably someone from the Diabolos cult.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was Viscount Jean, Captain of the Third Knights, Fourth Corps.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I had expected it, but the Knights have been infiltrated by people from the Diabolos cult. I can&#8217;t trust the Knights now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What about Iris-sama? Isn&#8217;t it possible to rely on the Crimson Knights?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nee-sama is&#8230;&#8230; busy right now. Either way, there&#8217;s no doubt that the Diabolos cult plotting something by kidnapping the academy&#8217;s students.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Plotting what?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The phenomenon that is very similar to the &#8220;Sanctuary&#8221; is happening at Midgar Academy. That means it&#8217;s not surprising that Devil Diabolos is sealed here, just like in the Sanctuary.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, there was a rumor that Diabolos&#8217; right hand was sealed in Midgar Academy&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s just a rumor, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia slowly shook her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t say that for certain.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There is no proof yet&#8230;&#8230; But there is a forbidden book in the library that contains the history of the academy. If Diabolos&#8217; right hand is sealed in Midgar Academy, it must be written in it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Can royalty be granted access to the Forbidden Library?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to take a long time to process.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then what are you going to do about it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ll just have to sneak in.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia grinned.</p>



<p>&#8220;If they find out, we&#8217;re in big trouble.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We just have to not be found. We can&#8217;t trust the Knights, we can&#8217;t trust the teachers —— which means we have to figure it out ourselves.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If they find out, they&#8217;re going to rescind the job offer.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll hire you. I&#8217;m used to throwing gold coins.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you need to throw it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hierarchy is important, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, we have to do it. Even at this very moment, the Diabolos cult is operating in the dark and the Shadow Gardens are assembling. If we don&#8217;t do something, the number of victims will only continue to increase.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing Alexia&#8217;s story, Claire thought about something with a downcast look on her face. Then she spoke slowly.</p>



<p>&#8220;What about leaving it to Shadow Garden?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia was surprised and speechless for a moment.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Shadow Gardens is a mysterious organization. We don&#8217;t know why they are at odds with the cult, and we can&#8217;t trust them unconditionally.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so? I feel like they saved my life in the lawless city.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Still &#8230;&#8230; They are dangerous. If such a powerful force were to be directed against this country, nee-sama&#8217;s concerns are reasonable.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8230; But I might understand her. Because Shadow single-handedly overpowered Elizabeth, the Queen of Blood. If the Queen of Blood&#8217;s strength is as legend has it, then Shadow is out of the ordinary.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to believe that she was indeed weakened&#8230;&#8230; If the legend is true, the Kingdom of Midgar will be at Shadow&#8217;s mercy for the rest of its existence.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;One wrong move and he would be a greater threat than the Diabolos cult.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right. Shadow Garden also has an entourage called the Seven Shades. They&#8217;re pretty skilled, too. Each one of them is as good as or better than Iris-neesama&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s not just about Shadow, their organization is very strong.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Come to think of it, Zeta, the beastman, too&#8230;&#8230; Aurora was unusually wary. She said she couldn&#8217;t see her limit.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope they are on our side too. But&#8230;&#8230; Right now, I still can&#8217;t believe them. They are too dangerous.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia bit her lip.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess so&#8230;&#8230; We can only do what we can do. I will cooperate, Alexia.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Claire, thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire held her hand, which was engraved with a magic circle.</p>



<p>&#8220;Waiting won&#8217;t get anything done. I need to know about Aurora, about this magic circle, and also about Shadow &#8230;&#8230; I need to know. Thank you, Alexia.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia was puzzled by the unexpected words.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for listening to me. I was worried I couldn&#8217;t do anything on my own. It made me feel better because you believed in me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So I understand how Alexia feels. I know how it must feel to be alone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am not really&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia&#8217;s voice trembled.</p>



<p>Her big sister swung her sword as if possessed by something and stopped looking at Alexia.</p>



<p>Rose left Alexia behind and went far away by herself.</p>



<p>Natsume is not a problem because she doesn&#8217;t trust her from the start.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do our best together&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia naturally held the hand that Claire held out to her. She felt warmly wrapped in it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Claire, thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I can keep an eye on you while I&#8217;m at it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire murmured, and then gripped Alexia&#8217;s hand tightly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If it eliminates one evil bug, it&#8217;s a small price to pay.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-It hurts, Claire.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, I&#8217;m sorry. A pleasure to work with you, Alexia.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;M-Me too, Claire.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia squeezed back and they both laughed.</p>

<p>&#8216;They are similar&#8217;, the ghost thought.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>


<p>Claire and Alexia stop in front of one of the rooms in the girls&#8217; dormitory.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nee, is that true Claire?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia said with a suspicious look on her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true. If we ask Nina, there is no doubt about it. Sid told me that he once told Nina that he wanted to read a book from the Forbidden Library, and the next day she got it for him!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? I&#8217;m getting more and more suspicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. Sid would never lie to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No. He&#8217;s a man of lies and greed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, don&#8217;t make fun of Sid.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just telling you the truth.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia cut off the conversation and knocked on the door.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, ye~s.&#8221;</p>



<p>A light reply is given and the door opens.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yaa, Claire. I&#8217;m glad you&#8217;re okay. We were worried about you.&#8221;</p>



<p>She is a petite girl with wine red hair.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry for worrying you, Nina.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re safe, that&#8217;s all that matters. Next time you go missing, give me a word.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I would if I could.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, that&#8217;s an unusual duo. Nice to meet you, Princess Alexia.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nina looked at Alexia with a sideways glance.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hi, nice to meet you, Nina-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just call me Nina. When did you two get so close?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We haven&#8217;t gotten along yet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Rather, we&#8217;re enemies&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia and Claire answered almost at the same time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, fine. Come on in anyway. You want to talk, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, she invites them into the room.</p>



<p>Nina sat on the bed and crossed her legs, while Alexia and Claire sat in simple chairs.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can I ask you one question before we get down to business?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia said so with a troubled look.</p>



<p>&#8220;Go ahead, ask anything you want.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you dressed in your underwear?&#8221;</p>



<p>For some reason, Nina was in sexy underwear.</p>



<p>She is petite, but has a great style that even women can&#8217;t help but be attracted to.</p>



<p>&#8220;Because it&#8217;s easier.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you always like this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Mitsugoshi Company&#8217;s underwear is the most comfortable and well-designed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nina smiled as she rolled up the transparent part as if to show it off.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8230;&#8230; Tell me the item&#8217;s stock number later.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. I have another recommendation?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Show me that, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a serious face, Alexia replied immediately.</p>



<p>&#8220;You never get a chance to show them anyway.&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire snickers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shut up&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia glares.</p>



<p>&#8220;Forget about that, let&#8217;s get down to business.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess so. It&#8217;s almost time for me to go to bed, so please make it quick. Staying up late is the worst enemy of my beautiful skin.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. I want to ask Nina about the forbidden book. How did you get it?&#8221;</p>



<p>At Claire&#8217;s question, Nina&#8217;s eyes blinked.</p>



<p>&#8220;Forbidden book? I don&#8217;t know what you&#8217;re talking about.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to hide it, Sid told me. You took the book out of the forbidden library.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Otouto-kun did? No way I can&#8217;t do that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I said, you don&#8217;t have to hide it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not hiding it. It makes no sense.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;ll be able to sneak into the forbidden library.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Like I told you. Pochi lied.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia says, making fun of her.</p>



<p>&#8220;S-Shut up! Nina, is it true? You&#8217;re really not hiding it!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;C-Calm down, Claire! It&#8217;s true!&#8221;</p>



<p>Nina&#8217;s bra hooks come loose as Claire jiggles Nina&#8217;s shoulders.</p>



<p>&#8220;Uuwh~~~!&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire bites her lip with a bright red face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid, you idiot! You lied to me again! I&#8217;ll never forgive you!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;After all, you&#8217;re being lied to&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shut up, shut up! I&#8217;m going home!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you going home?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going back to my room!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-Wait a minute! We still have to discuss tomorrow&#8217;s plans&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia hurriedly chases after Claire, who leaves the room with a bright red face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m sorry to bother you~&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t quite understand, but try not to be too reckless.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Nina said so, Alexia closed the door with an ambiguous smile.</p>



<p>In the quiet room, Nina stands up and walks over to the window.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well.&#8221;</p>



<p>The unhooked bra fell to the floor, her figure reflected in the windowpane.</p>



<p>There is a deep scar on the left breast.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I guess it&#8217;s time to move&#8221;</p>



<p>She strokes the scars with her slender fingertips.</p>



<p>Beyond that cold gaze, the deep darkness of the night continued.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>


<p>I like to take walks at night.</p>



<p>The world lit by the moon is quiet and erases the doubts of the mind.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t often get lost these days, but in a previous life, I sometimes wavered between the ideal and the reality of becoming &#8220;The Eminence in Shadow&#8221;.</p>



<p>At such times, it is good to practice mindlessly, but it is also not bad to take a walk at night to reflect on oneself.</p>



<p>Looking up at the moon in a quiet world can make me look like &#8220;The Eminence in Shadow&#8221;.</p>



<p>If there is a biker gang that is making bombastic noises, I will swing a crowbar down on them in the name of the cause.</p>



<p>Well, anyway, that&#8217;s why I often sneak out of the dormitory after entering academy and go out for a walk at night.</p>



<p>My favorite thing to do these days is to look down on the night world from the rooftop of the school.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kukuku&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s cool just to laugh fearlessly like this.</p>



<p>The moonlight is especially beautiful today.</p>



<p>I washed away Delta&#8217;s saliva, took out a red gem and held it up to the moon.</p>



<p>The deep red color is fantastic and outrageously beautiful.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s like it&#8217;s filled with some kind of magic power. I wonder how much it will cost.&#8221;</p>



<p>Well well, Delta did a great job.</p>



<p>I am now looking forward to putting it up for auction at Mitsugoshi Company.</p>



<p>If the high price is reached, I&#8217;ll buy all the &#8220;The Eminence in Shadow Set&#8221; I&#8217;ve put on my mind&#8217;s shopping list.</p>



<p>The black lion&#8217;s stole and the dark crystal tableware, and then&#8230;&#8230;.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;.Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>I looked to the side and saw an old man in a black robe standing in the corner of the rooftop.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s unusual for a place like this.</p>



<p>Hmm? Looking closely, isn&#8217;t he wearing a black robe made of dark spider silk?</p>



<p>There is no doubt about that sheen and deep black.</p>



<p>It is a supreme material texture that cannot be produced by cheap products.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; He&#8217;s got good taste.&#8221;</p>



<p>I observed an old man with good taste.</p>



<p>He has silver hair that grows to his waist.</p>



<p>The face is quite cool, with deeply shaped, eagle-like eye pupils.</p>



<p>When I listen carefully, he seems to be muttering something.</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re behind schedule. Checking against the plans&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>He&#8217;s a thief.</p>



<p>Those who prepare the plans and sneak in are the only kind of people who can do that.</p>



<p>It seems that the academy is full of valuable artifacts and such.</p>



<p>In other words, he&#8217;s a stylish thief.</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew they intervened. But we&#8217;ll get rid of anyone who gets in the way. &#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s it.&#8221;</p>



<p>He is muttering something meaningful without knowing that I am watching him.</p>



<p>Isn&#8217;t he have nice taste in his choice of words.</p>



<p>At that moment, the stylish thief suddenly turned around.</p>



<p>Our eyes met perfectly.</p>



<p>I am hiding my presence, but I am not hiding my figure. Naturally, I can be seen.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wha!? How long have you been ther——&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, don&#8217;t mind me. I was just taking a walk.&#8221;</p>



<p>I have no intention of disturbing him, so I appeal to him to be harmless.</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t even look like a member of the Knights. Well, who are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;An ordinary student, I guess.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A student, huh? &#8230;&#8230; Judging from your mannerisms, it doesn&#8217;t look like you&#8217;re lying. I didn&#8217;t expect to be seen by a mere student on my first day of arrival.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure it can happen. Well, see you later.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait. Now that you&#8217;ve seen me, I have to erase you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m not trying to get in your way or anything. I don&#8217;t care if there are thieves breaking into Midgar Academy——&#8221;</p>



<p>But the Stylish Thief did not listen to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re out of luck, boy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oops.&#8221;</p>



<p>I dodge the two scythes aimed at my neck with a sway.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s reasonably fast and he&#8217;s strong for a thief.</p>



<p>As expected of a stylish thief.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wha——! You dodged it!?&#8221;</p>



<p>He was wary and <em>maai </em>is open. <em>(TLN: distance between opponents)</em></p>



<p>&#8220;You &#8230;&#8230; aren&#8217;t just a student.&#8221;</p>



<p>The Stylish Thief&#8217;s voice lowered.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mean to interrupt you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That technique, are you a special unit of the Knights. You&#8217;re the first person to ever deceive me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m just an ordinary student, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nonsense, It was you who killed &#8220;The Dark Smile&#8221; right. It&#8217;s hardly likely that he would call for reinforcements. No wonder they sent me, the &#8220;Dark Spider&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Unn, I think you got the wrong guy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re out of luck.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Luck?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m —— stronger than &#8220;Dark Smile&#8221;.&#8221;</p>



<p>The stylish thief scythe slashed my arm.</p>



<p><em>GAKII!!</em></p>



<p>A hard sound comes from the arm and sparks fly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wha, I can&#8217;t cut him!&#8221;</p>



<p>I change my uniform.</p>



<p>The black slime covered my arm like a flowing stream and made a claw at the tip of it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Black Equipment, it&#8217;s Shadow Garden&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>The stylish thief hurriedly took a distance.</p>



<p>But no matter how he moves, the result will not change.</p>



<p>&#8220;So fas!?&#8221;</p>



<p>I closed the distance and hollowed out his heart with my claws.</p>



<p>&#8220;Impossible&#8230;&#8230;.T-This power&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>He clenches my claws with both hands and his face contorts.</p>



<p>&#8220;No way&#8230;&#8230;.No, in a place like this&#8230;&#8230;. No way, by a guy who disguised as a student. Fenrir-sama&#8230;&#8230;.I am so sor&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>He said that much and coughed up a lot of blood.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yare yare, another wasted kill.&#8221;</p>



<p>I take the black robe of dark spider silk to keep the blood from staining it and kick him off the rooftop.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, crap.&#8221;</p>



<p>Looking down, I saw a stylish thief had fallen to his death.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s all well and good, but the point where he fell was on top of the statue, and unluckily, he was pierced by the sword that the statue held up.</p>



<p>It was like some kind of execution.</p>



<p>What should I do with the corpse?</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Well, doesn&#8217;t matter&#8221;</p>



<p>There&#8217;s a lot of blood splattered all over the place and it looks to be a hassle to clean up.</p>



<p>It was a surprise present from me to the students who lead an ordinary school life.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, I noticed a strange white fog floating around me.</p>



<p>There should not have been any fog a while ago.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fog&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>But in the blink of an eye, the fog disappeared without a trace.</p>



<p>&#8220;Areh, it&#8217;s just my imagination&#8230;&#8230;or maybe not?&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not a mistake.</p>



<p>It was only for a moment, but I was sure I saw a white fog.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; It doesn&#8217;t matter.&#8221;</p>



<p>I can see white fog, but it has nothing to do with my life, and if it is fog, I can see it as much as I want in the mountains.</p>



<p>Rather than that, tonight I shall sleep with a black robe of dark spider silk on my wall.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>

<p>It was a place that was dim and white foggy.</p>



<p>Four cylindrical red lights illuminate the surroundings.</p>



<p>&#8220;The fit rate is low &#8230;&#8230; I guess it&#8217;s still a bad subject. It&#8217;s hard to get demon possession at all these days.&#8221;</p>



<p>A thin man stood in front of the cylindrical light.</p>



<p>He sighs as he writes the letters in the file at hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is there no report of the procurement unit of the subject yet?&#8221;</p>



<p>Upon closer look, there was something floating in the red light.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s human.</p>



<p>Four human bodies were floating in the light, connected by what looked like thin tubes.</p>



<p>The tube seems to be expanding and contracting like a living creature, sucking something out. Already there is no life in the human face.</p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have time &#8230;&#8230; At this rate &#8230;&#8230; &#8220;</p>



<p>He paces back and forth in front of the red light.</p>



<p>At that moment, he heard footsteps coming from the fog.</p>



<p>&#8220;[Willow]-kun, how are you doing?&#8221;</p>



<p>The owner of the voice stopped in the fog and said so.</p>



<p>The thin man called &#8220;Willow&#8221; hurriedly straightens his posture.</p>



<p>&#8220;We have secured four students from the academy who are compatible with the magic power. They are absorbing magic power smoothly, so I think the seal will eventually be broken&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eventually, I&#8217;m sure there were also four objects before, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, there&#8217;s been an interruption from Shadow Garden&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Gulping, &#8220;Willow&#8221; swallowed his spit.</p>



<p>&#8220;I heard that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That, apparently, was the executive level of the Shadow Garden as well.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He~e&#8230;&#8230;Is it &#8220;Seven Shades&#8221;?&#8221;</p>



<p>The unidentifiable man seemed intrigued.</p>



<p>&#8220;Perhaps. It&#8217;s probably &#8220;Seven Shades&#8221; which we have never seen yet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I guess it&#8217;s Zeta.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. She seems to be good at running away and hiding&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t heard many reports of her fighting. Even though I just thought she was not good at fighting.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The fact that &#8220;The Dark Smile&#8221; was eliminated means that she is at least as good as or better than the named children.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuhn. It sounds pretty interesting, doesn&#8217;t it? Speaking of which, I heard you called for a replacement for &#8220;The Dark Smile&#8221;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We called the top-ranked &#8220;Dark Spider&#8221; among the Named Children to take all possible precautions. With this, the plan is——&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The &#8220;Dark Spider&#8221; is dead.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He was skewered in front of the academy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ano&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s true.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;R-Really? No, of course I don&#8217;t doubt it. You think Zeta killed him?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who knows. I don&#8217;t know who the culprit is, but they work fast, Shadow Garden. I envy them. I wish I had a subordinate like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you going to do about the delayed plans?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re going to call in more reinforcements from headquarters.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Our funds were greatly reduced by the recent credit collapse. I&#8217;m sure we could get more people for the 2nd and 3rd, but I&#8217;m not sure we can handle it by gathering a bunch of small fries.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-That&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Shadow Garden is already aware of these ruins. There&#8217;s not much time left before the defense system is breached.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve already found the prime subjects. Claire Kagenou and, with your permission, Alexia Midgar. Once we have these two, I think we can finish the project quickly.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alexia Midgar, huh&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;After all, is it difficult?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..No, that&#8217;s fine. Zenon must have already laid his hands on her. Some overdoing is allowed. A little overstepping is acceptable. We, Fenrir Faction, have administered the Kingdom of Midgar for a long time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I will instruct my subordinates.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re going too, &#8220;Willow&#8221;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh&#8230;..?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about time you missed the scene. Since I&#8217;ve set up a position for you at the academy, use it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, my arm is already&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>At that moment, wind pressure passed through the neck of &#8220;Willow&#8221; and left a single scar.</p>



<p>&#8220;The position of &#8220;Willow&#8221; would make them both let their guard down.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m busy coordinating the ruins. You&#8217;ve got to make it work.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Willow&#8221; left as if to run away.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Something is projected in the fog.</p>



<p>There were two girls in the image. A golden-haired beastman and a pink-blonde human.</p>



<p>They are two of the Shadow Garden.</p>



<p>&#8220;So this is Zeta and the &#8220;Saint&#8221;, huh&#8230;&#8230;I didn&#8217;t expect Shadow Garden to pick her up. I wonder what would happen if that country found out&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta and Viktoria in the video proceed through the white fog.</p>



<p>Behind them, there was another shadow.</p>



<p>They wear a different robe from Shadow Garden and their face is hidden by a hood.</p>



<p>&#8220;The defense system has been breached to the third layer. Depending on the results of &#8220;Willow&#8221;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>As he muttered so, the man&#8217;s presence disappeared.</p>



<p>Images continue to be projected in an empty space.</p>



<p>From within the image, golden eyes were looking over here.</p>
