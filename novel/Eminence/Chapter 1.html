<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 1: Makabe Shizuru’s New Daily Life</b></h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 1</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The alarm clock woke me up, and when I opened my eyes, I was not in the room I had been using for the past 16 years.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That being said, I have been here for more than half a month now, so I was getting used to it by now.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got out of bed and turned off the alarm, which was on snooze. Then I changed into my loungewear and left the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m currently on the second floor. This house is quite spacious, so there are washrooms on both the first and second floors. After washing my face, I went downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Hasumi-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Standing there was Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is an upperclassman at my school, but also my half-sister.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I, Makabe Shizuru, grew up with just my mother, a single-parent household.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was left to dust because of my situation, and it was Hasumi&#8217;s father who appeared in front of me. He told me that he was my father, and I was taken in by the Hasumi family.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, I was planning to leave this residence by the time summer vacation rolls in. It was obvious that Hasumi-senpai doesn’t take kindly to the idea of having me around. Even if it were just a matter of time, it would be difficult to suddenly accept a boy as a freeloader, even more so if he was a proof of her father&#8217;s disloyalty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I figured that if Hasumi-san helped me once and I left of my own volition, he would at least be satisfied that he had fulfilled his duty as a father.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, after all the twists and turns, I ended up staying with the Hasumi family for a while.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning. Finally up?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was sitting on the sofa in the living room, reading a newspaper spread out on the glass-topped low table. But when I came downstairs, she looked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll make breakfast right away. Help out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying so, she stood up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no sight of Uncle in the living room or kitchen. He’s a doctor at a university hospital in the prefecture and tends to be away for when he’s on duty or called away due to a sudden change in the condition of a patient that he’s in charge of.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fact that Uncle was not present is evident from Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s attire, which consists of a loose-fitting T-shirt and dolphin pants. If he’s present, she wears normal, everyday clothes, perhaps out of concern for her parents&#8217; eyes, but when he’s gone, she instantly becomes more open in what she wears. If possible, I want that kind of concern too. I wonder if she’s aware that she has a body that matches gravure idols.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I moved to the kitchen along with Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She wanted me to help her, but when I looked at the dining table, it seemed like it was almost done. All that was left to do was to put it on a plate, or just heat it up again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I watched the scene, I thought to myself, ‘It&#8217;s about time to start helping out around the house.’ Cleaning, laundry, meal preparation. Just anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had previously planned to leave this house sooner or later, so I had refrained from touching anything in the house, since I was just an outsider. However, since I would be staying here for a while, I had to do what I could. No pain, no gain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, still half-asleep?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it’s nothing really…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai brought me back to my senses, and I started to move my hands. My job here was to toast the bread. I quickly took out two slices of bread from the bag. With that, the bag was empty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai, it’s just these left.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm, sure. I’ll go buy some on the way home.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I placed the two slices of bread in the toaster, Hasumi-senpai responded as she was preparing something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Grocery…’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you think about it, shopping is a chore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I was told to buy this and that, I would go as much as she wanted me to, but it seems that Hasumi-senpai is the type of person who thinks about what to buy on the fly. So, I guess the only thing I could do is to carry the baggage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll tag along with the shopping this holiday.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That so? Well, it&#8217;s nice to have a man&#8217;s help, so I can freely buy whatever.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently I can be useful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a second!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai suddenly let out a loud voice. When I turned around in surprise, she was looking at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What if someone sees me shopping with you, they might misunderstand…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misunderstanding?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Like living together, or close enough to go grocery shopping together&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mumbling continues far from her usual tone of voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I see what you mean. They’re not gonna misunderstand, since it’s true. We are living together, so it&#8217;s definitely cohabitation.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An inarticulate scream escaped Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We…were cohabitating?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai is just like me who’s not into love for a different reason, so I guess she does not have immunity or tolerance to it. She seems to react excessively to words related to those.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s all right. They would only see a tyrannic upperclassman who’s abusing her junior. In a way, that is also correct.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You… I can make your bacon black, you know?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry. I was just kidding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If she did that, I would have to accidentally overcooked the bread. If that happens, I will have to eat the burnt bread since there’s no more bread, it’s gonna be a double negative for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll be done in a minute. Just wait.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Here, done.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon after I took the jam out of the fridge and plated the salad, the bacon and eggs were cooked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai dexterously fried the two at the same time and placed them on a plate, and breakfast was complete.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“ “Thanks for the meal.” “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We took our seats and began our meal together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, it’s a hit today.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the middle of this, Hasumi-senpai suddenly opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bamboo branch for Tanabata.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Bamboo branch?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t know what it meant, so I asked back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Completing the line together with Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s earlier line, we get &#8216;The bamboo branches for Tanabata are a hit.’ I have no idea what she was saying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn&#8217;t you see it last year? Bamboos at the entrance.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahh.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she elaborated, I finally understood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At Akanedai High School, a large bamboo branch was placed at the entrance, where the shoe boxes are located when Tanabata Festival approaches. Nearby are strips of paper, on which students can write their wishes and tie them to the branches.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But just that. Nothing more than that, an annual event that can hardly be called an event. Well, considering that we will be in the middle of final exams in about 10 days, we can’t expect much. The bamboo branches will be disposed of after the Tanabata Festival, along with the strips of paper.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, it has become a playground there among the students. They write things that make you laugh uncontrollably, or shout out their love anonymously. In the past, I have heard that there were some brave students who wrote confessions with their names.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you write something, too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai asked me with a piece of bread in her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, not really. Last year, I was just a freshman. I wasn&#8217;t sure if I could do it or not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I guess that’s how it was gonna be. In my freshman year, I was just admiring it too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was convinced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about you, Hasumi-senpai?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think I&#8217;m the type who wishes on stars?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think it’s bad to have that cute side.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop with the cute.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At my answer, Hasumi-senpai grimaced with a red face and tapped my shin with her slippers on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi Shion is a woman who has a weakness at being called cute. She has a friendly personality and is approachable to both men and women alike, but she’s neither boyish nor neutral in any way. She’s best described as cute, and I have a feeling that she’s often called cute, but apparently not.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t really like that event in the first place.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai said while her face trembled slightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah. Since I often see my names in other people’s tanzaku strips, the same goes for Takinami-san.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I see.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mention of Takinami Ruika&#8217;s name convinced me this time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, whether it was anonymous or not, they will often be confess to. After all, she’s one of the pride and joy of our Akanedai High School. However, from her point of view, it would be a problem if she were to be told via wishes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m telling you, what you’re thinking about, that’s still cute.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Meaning?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;They would even write rather ungracious things about me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai spitefully spat out her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The people who are doing it are probably laughing their asses off, but for me it’s not that simple.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess a number of boys would do such a thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s another story that makes me want to apologize on behalf of the boys at our school.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As one would expect, one cannot help but feel sympathy for this. After all, Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s father, the closest man to her, had betrayed her mother and even had a child. On top of that, she herself had been subjected to the unrefined jokes of male students, so it was no surprise that she distrusted men.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, you do that too?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was unthinkable to be lumped in with such people. As I mentioned earlier, I have not even written an honest wish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ever thought of doing it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fell silent in response to Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s repeated questions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t get mad, just say it.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;’I wish to see Hasumi-senpai’s swimsuit someday.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Idi~ot.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After thinking about it for a while, I said it in a somewhat joking tone, and without a moment&#8217;s pause, Hasumi-senpai responded in a half-joking manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You really should stop saying what&#8217;s on your mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Recently, when I’m told to tell something, it doesn’t end well for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Well, since it’s already summer, going to the pool might not be bad.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Hasumi-senpai uttered a few words but somehow looked reluctant. Then, with a slightly reddened face, she continued to eat in silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This atmosphere was not good.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, I’m expecting for it to be radical―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai barked as if she was about to bite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geez, this is why men are…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai sighs again in dismay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Speaking of which, there&#8217;s a movie coming up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The atmosphere was a little better than before, so I changed the subject by broaching a new topic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right, there was one.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s eyebrows twitched as if her sensors had reacted, and then she answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were going to see a movie as a school event soon. The fact that the event is held at a rented movie theater in Sannomiya, rather than at school, suggests that it’s part of an extracurricular lesson.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Assemblee there, watch one movie, and then leave. No classes. It&#8217;s like a bonus stage.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A person who already experienced it twice, last year and the year before, said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No uniform is required on the day of the event, and everyone will be in civilian clothes. If the assembly were to be dismissed mid-day, it was only natural that people would go out and have fun. And it’s on Friday, the day before the weekend. That’s why Hasumi-senpai described it as a bonus stage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You won&#8217;t have to open the library, either, which should make things easier.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think so too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although I have never had a hard time with my duties as a member of the library committee, I decided to agree with Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 2</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After eating, I helped with whatever thing I could, then I returned to my room to get ready for school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I changed into my school uniform and went downstairs to find Hasumi-senpai, also in school uniform, reading a paperback book in the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has glasses on.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The square frames made Hasumi-senpai look intelligent and it suited her well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai read books this way in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was not because it was her habit. She simply can&#8217;t go to school with me, and I don&#8217;t have the key to this house, so Hasumi-senpai has to leave after me. It&#8217;s just a way to pass the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning my attention to the living room, I found a lunch box wrapped in cloth on the dining table. It was lunch that Hasumi-senpai had made for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mother used to make them for me all the time. But after she passed away, I thought I would never get to eat packed lunch again, but now Hasumi-senpai makes it for me every day. She says it’s not really a problem since she already makes lunch for herself and Uncle, and I&#8217;m grateful for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you as always.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I expressed my gratitude and was about to pick it up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heavy.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s voice came out as a reprimand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not knowing why she got angry, I looked back at the living room. Hasumi-senpai was looking at me with half-lidded eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s nice getting thanks but stop with that ‘as always.’ Your gratitude is heavy.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, it does sound like I’m thanking her for everything that she had done prior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then… thank you very much.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. You’re welcome. Although it’s not a big deal.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I thanked her again, Hasumi-senpai responded in a lighthearted manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I put my lunch in my bag and returned to the living room. By then, Hasumi-senpai was already looking down at her paperback book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I must say, those glasses look great on you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I once told Hasumi-senpai before that if you’re going to wear glasses anyway, you should choose the ones that suit you. I know it&#8217;s just a take-away, but glasses are an accessory that no one can be offended by. Since I can elaborate with confidence, it would be a loss if I don&#8217;t.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But even with her current glasses, they looked good enough on her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You should take responsibility for what you say.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai closed the paperback book and quietly replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because you told me to buy something that suits me, so you’re coming along with me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shouldn’t have let my mouth run off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, why don&#8217;t you just pick those out by yourself? You’re gonna be wearing it after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How could I know? This is coming from a person who thought all glasses are the same. Besides, didn’t Takinami-san say that you have a good sense of style? That’s why you notice unexpected things. Or what, you specialize in lingerie?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please don&#8217;t make me out to be some kind of weird expert.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With nothing to refute Hasumi-senpai’s words, I replied just that. Come to think of it, when I was picking out Takinami-senpai’s lingerie, Hasumi-senpai was also there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In the first place, how can you pick that out like it was nothing?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t pick it out like it was nothing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went back to the living room and put my bag on the sofa. I didn’t sit down, but stood up and continued talking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was already embarrassing enough for a man to be in a place like that, it would’ve been even more embarrassing if I picked out the wrong item. So, I racked my head hard to pick out something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I confess, Hasumi-senpai bursts out laughing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess that’s true… Then keep up the good work and pick something for me as if your life is on the line.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Underwear, you mean?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-o-o-of course not!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai grabbed a cushion by her side and threw it at me. I was used to it, so I caught it with one hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A-anyway, I&#8217;m going to have you go with me to buy some glasses. Understand?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure. When should we buy some?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, my bad. Not yet, I’ll let you know when it’s decided. If it’s inconvenient, just say so and we’ll reschedule it to another day.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have no right of refusal, yet she’s always willing to adjust for me. She truly can’t become selfish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I&#8217;ll leave first.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mhm. Take care.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I spoke as I held my bag in my hand again, and Hasumi-senpai replied. She, too, will be leaving one train ride later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I left the living room.</span></p>


<h3 style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 1: Makabe Shizuru’s New Daily Life</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 3</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai and I go to the same high school, but we go to school separately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was natural. We can’t let others know that we became siblings. One reason is that my mother and Hasumi-san have a relationship that is sensitive to talk about. If I were to reveal the relationship between me and Hasumi-senpai, I would have to mention the relationship between our parents.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Another reason is our position in school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai is one of the two most beautiful girls in our school, while on the other hand, I’m just an ordinary male student who’s not particularly eye-catching. Hasumi-senpai probably doesn&#8217;t want anyone to know that we became siblings, since people would make a big deal out of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s why she and I go to school at different times.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Private Akanedai High School is located in a school town near Seishin-Yamate line of the Kobe Municipal Subway. It&#8217;s just within walking distance from the station. It’s a nice walk if the weather is nice, but in mid-summer, it is a bit tedious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I arrived at the nearest station, Myodani, I went down from the ticket gate to the platform and waited for the train.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it’s a subway, the train runs above ground. Looking up, you can see the blue sky of early summer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Makabe?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I was called by name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned to see a well-dressed looking male student.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was my classmate Naoi Kyouhei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In layman&#8217;s terms, he’s a good-looking normie. He’s a top achiever, active in the handball team. A student with good grades and with looks. A male version of Takinami Ruika and Hasumi Shion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Naoi, huh? Morning.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He lined up beside me with his sports bag on his shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Was your station here too? I thought it was Shin-Nagata.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have relatives here. They&#8217;ve been taking care of me since my mother died.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, I gave an answer that was not a lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The Makabe residence resides in Shin-Nagata, about three stops away from Myodani in the direction of Sannomiya. Thanks to the Hasumi family taking me in, my commute to school was shortened by about 15 minutes. It seems that Naoi knew and remembered that I lived in Shin-Nagata before. I also knew that Naoi used this station. Information about classmates was just something that you somehow hear and remember.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi seems to be somewhat awkward.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know it&#8217;s a little late, but my condolence.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It couldn&#8217;t be helped. It was just bad luck.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, for the family that got left behind, such words are not enough to describe it, but it would be hard to move on without doing so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the train came onto the platform, we stopped talking and got on through the open doors. We stood side by side, holding on to the strap. It was only two stops from here to the school, but Naoi pushed his sports bag up on the shelf, perhaps deciding that his large bag would get in the way due to the crowded train.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, fortunately, a lot of people are helping me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the doors closed and the train began to accelerate, I opened my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Hasumi-san heard that my mother had passed away, he rushed to visit, and Hasumi-senpai accepted me. Thanks to them, I can continue to go to school as usual without any inconvenience.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You must have been blessed to have the right people around you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re one of those people.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Me? I didn’t do anything.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He first exclaimed in surprise, and then laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You let me join your group during lunch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When you’re a student as famous as Naoi, naturally there would be a group centered around him, and I used to eat lunch with his group in the school cafeteria until Hasumi-senpai started to make me lunch after my mother&#8217;s death.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s just because you asked me to, and I just said sure.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So that’s it, for you that’s all it amounts to.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, it was a normal thing for him to have people outside of his group ask to eat with him and he complies. A group has indeed formed around Naoi, but he didn’t wall up his group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s up with that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing. You should keep on being like that, I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi asked me with a laugh, to which I replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the train arrives at the station near the school, it&#8217;s on foot from there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So when we arrived at the classroom, Naoi walked in, mouthing his greeting at a volume that all in the class could hear. Naturally, most of his classmates, regardless of gender, responded. I followed right behind him, thinking it was a trick I couldn&#8217;t pull off.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Kyouhei-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the core members of Naoi&#8217;s group was the first to come up to him. He called out to him even though Naoi had not even put his bag down on his seat yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he glanced at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you’re with Makabe.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, we met on the train.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmmm.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He responds in a disinterested manner, as if he doesn&#8217;t care about me. Of course, he was only pretending. As soon as he came to Naoi, he asked about me, so he was quite conscious of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I parted from Naoi and went to my seat. I put my bag on the desk and went to the silent duo, who were the opposite of Naoi&#8217;s flamboyance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube Kagemitsu and Heshikiri Sakura.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They were sitting back to back, and seemed to be exchanging a few words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out to the two, Karube responded by raising his hand, and Heshikiri-san replied in a muffled voice, &#8220;Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You see. Izumikawa sees Makabe as an enemy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube suddenly said something. It seems that he had been properly watching the exchange at the entrance of the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Izumikawa was the boy who came up to Naoi just a few moments ago, the one who has been harboring an unconcealed hostility towards me for some time now. His full name is Izumikawa Satoshi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t like to comment on people&#8217;s appearance, but he’s a little overweight. He’s a little over ten kilograms over the average weight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he entered the second grade and was placed in the same class as Naoi, he tried to win Naoi&#8217;s favor by using his natural quick wittedness and nonchalant attitude. Thanks to his efforts, he successfully slipped into the core of the group and is now enjoying the glamorous high school life as a member of the group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Izumikawa is aware. He’s aware that he’s somewhat inferior to the people at Naoi&#8217;s group. Both in terms of appearance and ability. He’s afraid that if Naoi favors me, he might get kicked out of the group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was Karube&#8217;s view, and I’m also in agreement with him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does he really have to go that far to have a lively high school experience?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube said in dismay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s just that some people put more weight on that than anything else. Although I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s a good idea to use that as an absolute standard for evaluating people and school life.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever understand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re all about efficiency after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Conversely, the student named Karube Kagemitsu is the opposite. He hates the lively school life, and it seems to him that fussing among friends was a waste of time.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so. My ideal is a clock. I will only do an hour&#8217;s worth of work in an hour. No waste whatsoever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly nothing was more efficient at doing their job than a clock. You can&#8217;t be so uptight so that it advances fifteen minutes in ten minutes, since in that case, it’s just broken.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe-kun, your arm…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I chuckled at Karube&#8217;s typical thoughts, Heshikiri discreetly opened her mouth. Her gaze was fixed on my arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My left arm was bandaged. It was an honorary injury that I got the other day while defending Hasumi-senpai. Of course, she doesn’t want to point out that I have a wound. She was trying to tell me that my arm, which was hanging until yesterday, has lost its triangular bandage today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The last time I was at the hospital, the doctor told me I could remove it at any point. The discomfort is gone, and I figured I can move it around freely now, so I decided to take it off today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The bandages were just meant to hide the wounds, which were still a bit graphic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay. Then it’s healing properly. That’s great.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heshikiri-san replied in relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a kind-hearted girl.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 4(1)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school, the class ended with nothing noteworthy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m a member of the library committee. What’s more, I’m the only member.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The job is quite simple. I will open and close the library according to the time. During open hours, the main tasks are to handle books to be borrowed, return books, reservations, books to be distributed, and to organize the shelves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found out that there are schools where the library committee even selects the books, but our school doesn’t demand for their one and only library committee member to go that far. If I were allowed to do so, I would buy a book by Tsukasa Soichiro, an up-and-coming historical novelist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aside from that, the school is also a reasonably advanced school, so having the library closed would create a bad image. I guess they’re just thankful it’s being opened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After class, I head to the faculty to borrow the key and open the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai, who appears to have been waiting, is the first to enter the room. Even though we have known each other for quite a while, she just goes straight to her seat without ever saying a word to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From there, the regulars, who can be counted by hand, came in sporadically―and some unfamiliar faces would come and go.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, about fifteen minutes before the closing time, she arrived.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good afternoon, Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A melodic voice calls my name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I looked up, I saw a female student with mature, beautiful features and long hair that looked like it had been carefully set over time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Takinami-senpai. Good afternoon.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She comes like this every day some time before closing. Until then, she seems to have been chatting with her classmates in the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s closing soon, right? Good work.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“All is well. There’s no good work, since it’s not hard.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be great if I could get paid for this, but unfortunately it’s an unpaid volunteer activity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I remembered Naoi&#8217;s words, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">You must have been blessed to have the right people around you,</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> and I thought that Takinami-senpai is one of those people. Ever since I returned to school after my mother&#8217;s funeral, she had been taking care of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was thinking while dealing with Takinami-senpai, the pre-bell rang.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s only the regulars who stayed until this hour. They knew that I was going to kick them out the moment it became six o&#8217;clock, so they immediately started preparing to leave the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When everyone had left except for one, Takinami-senpai called me by my given name.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami Ruika is this kind of a person.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, she acts all ladylike, just like a calm honor student. But when she’s alone with me, her true colors would instantly show itself. If Hasumi Shion is a person without a hidden side, Takinami Ruika is the exact opposite.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has always been able to look at herself and her surroundings objectively and was adept at reading what people around her demand from her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People around her expect her to be beautiful and intelligent, and Takinami-senpai continues to respond.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The result of that is her current self. In a sense, she is an idol that embodies the ideals of those around her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answer curtly as I tidy up the counter for the closing of the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of the real her, I stop playing the role of a serious library board member, or even a male student who admires her very much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You seemed to have been watching me a few times while I was talking to others, Is there something wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she mentioned something strange, I stopped what I was doing and looked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Yeah.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about it for a bit, and somehow had the idea that it might be that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Takinami-senpai blushed a little and whispered in a subdued tone even though there was no one around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, just so you know, it’s not the one you picked for me. If you ask me what it is, then I’ll have a hard time answering since it’s not very s**y…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wasn’t watching you with that intention.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why do both Takinami-senpai and Hasumi-senpai want to drag this topic out so much? For me, I would like to be over from the moment I picked something.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Then what is it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She didn’t drop the subject. Well, if someone were looking at you impolitely, it would be natural to wonder why.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just had a thought. Ever since my mom’s death, I’ve been helped by many people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I agree. I know it’s wrong to say this, but Hasumi-san&#8217;s father has a duty to help you as your parent. But I think the rest is the result of your character, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t have the kind of character that would warrant people to help me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’m very calculating and above all, I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">lack</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> something fatal. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I had a thought that you’re one of the people who helped me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course I’m going to help you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stated without hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so. You’re the type of person who’s equally kind to everybody.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People around her wanted her to be so, and she responded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not it. The reason why I’m helping you is because we’re </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kindred spirits</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">. You have the same eyes as me and see the same things as I do. You’re special to me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai referred to me as her </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kindred spirit</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like herself, I can objectively see the situation at any given time, even myself. I am able to determine how I should behave and what kind of facial expressions I should make.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">kindred spirits</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s natural for me, but if you appreciate it, then you can be my boyfriend.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The price is too great.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Look here, Shizuru. Calling it a price is a little mean.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai said with a half smile. Of course, it’s not funny. She was just about to lose her temper, because she didn’t like the way I called it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not cut out for love.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That again?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was putting advances on me, but I brushed it off with a curt smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let me say this so that there’s no misunderstanding, but it’s not that I don’t have any feelings for Takinami-senpai. On the contrary, I probably like her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like most boys, I had admired her since I had only watched her from afar. And even after I got to know her true face, I still liked her clear-cut personality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But I </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">lack</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because I’ve become so good at optimizing my behavior, I don’t know how much of my emotions are spontaneous and how much is just made up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Therefore, I’m not confident in my feelings of liking Takinami-senpai. As long as that’s the case, I should not respond to her lightly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, whatever.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai said with a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;re feeling grateful, go home with me today.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if it’s just that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, c**p.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after I answered her, she voiced that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I knew you were gonna easily agree, I should have switched it to a date.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">How headstrong.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Shizuru―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m telling you, you can’t change it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I interrupted Takinami-senpai and said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then a chime rang to prevent further pursuit. It was the main bell. Perhaps discouraged by it, Takinami-senpai let out a sigh of resignation as the chime rang out, </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on…”</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, I’m gonna close the library, so wait outside.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Should I help?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. There’s not much to do today.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On days when there are a lot of books returned, organizing the shelves can continue for an hour, but that was not the case today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And besides.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I showed her my left arm to show that I can use both hands from today. Granted, I have never needed her hand, even when I only had one arm to use.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Okay.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai gave a smile and turned on her heels, and left the library.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, then.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a voice and looked at the reading table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There is one student left on the table. ―It was Kanata-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She usually leaves the library exactly on time, but today she is still in the process of packing up her belongings after six o&#8217;clock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kanata-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to her side and spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Mibu Kanata is a special being in Akanedai High School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her sharp features and supernatural demeanor, she is an object of awe and is treated as untouchable, and was called ‘Empress’ by others. She is no less beautiful than Takinami Ruika and Hasumi Shion, but for the aforementioned reasons above, she was never mentioned alongside them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And she and I were from the same junior high school. We have known each other longer than I have Takinami-senpai and Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll be out in a moment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no need to rush.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said, since she’s already packing her belongings, meaning not rushing wouldn’t make much difference. But if she was just about to pack her things up, I would have rushed her as a library committee.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aren’t you making Takinami wait?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You were listening?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had assumed that she was absorbed in what she wanted to do, and was unconcerned with what was happening in her surroundings.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can guess from the situation.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of Kanata-senpai. I wonder if imagination is the key to finding answers from fragmented information.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As usual, Takinami really favors you a lot.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that good or not?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, it’s better to be liked than hated. However, when it’s Takinami Ruika we’re talking about, it’s a bit unnerving.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I like her too. If only I could just honestly say that I like her.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave a self-deprecating laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe Shizuru is not cut out for love.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s how it is.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai stated the reason why, and I nodded in agreement.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t have to be confident in your feelings to fall in love.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That would be insincere, wouldn’t it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You think?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata senpai curiously tilts her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Knowing what kind of attitude will make the other person happy, and what kind of words will touch their heart, it’s rather great for romance, don’t you think?”</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/kSQQqKB/00010.jpg" alt="00010" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In that case, you would just be a philosophical zombie.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without qualia or subjective will, just analyzing physical phenomena that occur in front of them and responding appropriately &#8211; that is a philosophical zombie. It’s said that if such a thing existed, it would be indistinguishable from a human being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Use your words properly. Philosophical zombies are hypothetical thought experiments. It’s not a term to ridicule people who are like machines without feelings.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of a writer. She’s very picky about these things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know it&#8217;s wrong, but it&#8217;s not sincere to associate with someone with such a philosophical zombie attitude.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I argued back, Kanata-senpai stopped putting away her belongings and looked at me intently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I almost flinch when she gazes at me with her beauty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re not a philosophical zombie if you can think like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is what I would like to say, but philosophical zombies can even do that and are indistinguishable from humans.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I bet.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, that&#8217;s what it&#8217;s all about. We are not talking about human beings because of what they can do, or philosophical zombies because of what they cannot do. After all, it starts from the point where it is defined as indistinguishable from a human being.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it&#8217;s the same thing. There is no way for sure to know if your feelings are sincere. So you just keep on thinking. And be as honest with your feelings as you are with Takinami.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Keep on thinking. Be true to my feelings, huh?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I repeat Kanata-senpai&#8217;s words in my mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At present, what you&#8217;re thinking about just sounds like an excuse.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takinami is glaring at us.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">RIght. I was making Takinami-senpai wait. I looked back at the library doorway, and there she was, arms crossed and mouth agape. I could see that she was visibly irritated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since he couldn’t forget his first woman, so I―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please stop. You’re just gonna complicate things!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A scream came out of my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why does she sometimes actively try to light fires when she’s usually reserved?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, come on, I’m gonna close the library, so please get the h**l out.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a tyrannical librarian.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata senpai snickered and walked to the doorway with her bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad. It took a little time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I hurriedly closed the library and headed for Takinami-senpai, who was waiting for me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did Kanata-senpai say something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Nothing really.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I patted my chest in relief. It seems she didn&#8217;t say anything unnecessary.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, there was a big problem standing in front of me. Takinami-senpai, who had her arms crossed and her mouth tightened into a straight line.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You sure took your sweet time talking.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was locking the library door, she spoke behind my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We had a little discussion about philosophical zombies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How did it get to that topic when you were just making her leave the room…? Is it true or is it just a terrible excuse?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai sighs in dismay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I finished locking the door and made sure it was properly locked before I started walking away. Takinami-senpai followed after me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Shizuru? What kind of relationship do you really have with Mibu-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing in particular.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While heading to the staff room―Takinami-senpai asked me and I gave a vague answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it something you can’t tell me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s unfair if you say it like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m a woman after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said without hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This person is nasty because she uses being a woman as a weapon in a broad sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kanata-senpai and I went to the same junior high school. We’ve known each other since then. Our relationship is several times longer than the one between me and you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you put it that way, I was compelled to answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that the limit of your relationship?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, think about it. If it’s just that, you don’t need to keep it under wraps. Which means there’s something else, am I wrong?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s something that’s obvious if you think about it a little. But now I feel as if my heart had been seen through, along with the shallow deception.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Correct.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I knew it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying this, Takinami senpai gave a small laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, without saying anything or asking more questions, she continued to walk down the corridor in silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re not gonna ask?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won’t.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai answered my question without hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if I ask, I don’t think you would answer. Because for you, I’m not someone who you can talk to about such things yet. But―just you wait. You will be mine soon.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She stated with confidence and smiled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami Ruika is strong in every way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Let me be clear, there is no secret between me and Kanata-senpai that I want to take to my grave. If I wanted to say it, I could say it here and now. However, I felt that by doing so, it would be disrespectful to the enthusiasm she showed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Be true to my feelings, huh?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recall Kanata-senpai&#8217;s words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wish I could say I like Takinami Ruika with pride.</span></p>
