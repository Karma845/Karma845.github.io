<h2>Prologue: Darkness lurks in a Peaceful School, A Case of Missing Students!</h2>

<p>&#8220;Just in time&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I exhaled in relief as I left the auditorium of Midgar Swordsman Academy. My white breath disappears into the morning sky.</p>



<p>Just now, the opening ceremony of the third semester has just ended.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good grief, where have you been all winter break, Sid?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, we promised that we would all try to pick up Mitsugoshi Shokai&#8217;s ladies, didn&#8217;t we?&#8221;</p>



<p>The mob faces of Hyoro and Jaga are also somewhat nostalgic.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry, sorry, I have some urgent business.&#8221;</p>



<p>With the succession to the throne of the Oriana Kingdom and my unexpected return to Japan, my winter vacation was filled with many fun events.</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;ve been through a lot while you&#8217;ve been gone&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, Sid-kun&#8217;s sister tied me up&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Hyoro and Jaga said resentfully.</p>



<p>&#8220;Claire-neesan?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It looks like she was trying to find out where Sid was. I told her I didn&#8217;t know, but she&#8217;s poking me in the neck with her sword&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;When I said, &#8220;You&#8217;re so cute, would you like me to go out with you?&#8221; she almost put a sword in my butt&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aah, is that so. Sorry sorry.&#8221;</p>



<p>I guess I should stay away from my sister for a while.</p>



<p>&#8220;Speaking of trouble, the missing former president Rose is now the princess of the Oriana Kingdom, and the whole country is in an uproar.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know that one.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fufufu, no one would ever think that I led her to become king.</p>



<p>Behind the birth of the Great King, there was an unknown involvement of &#8220;The Eminence in Shadow&#8221; ―― And his identity is that of an ordinary student from anywhere.</p>



<p>This is the real thrill of &#8220;The Eminence in Shadow&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not all. There was a mass outbreak of demons in the Oriana Kingdom, or the country was taken over.&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course I know that.</p>



<p>After all, it was &#8220;The Eminence in Shadow&#8221; who led the way and solved the whole thing. You will never know that there is a key figure in front of you.</p>



<p>&#8220;This will likely terminate the alliance with the Oriana Kingdom.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hmm?</p>



<p>Termination of alliance?</p>



<p>&#8220;Right. I never thought that former President Rose would fall into the path of evil&#8230;&#8230;Public opinion will never allow it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Path of evil? Eh? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I said, former President Rose summoned demons to slaughter the heir to the throne and take over the Oriana Kingdom. She is truly a villainous, evil woman who will go down in history.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She was such a good person at the academy, but I never thought she would do something like this. Even at the War God Festival, she killed her own father, which means that a person is not what she appears to be. Well, if she insists, I can marry her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-Now that you mention it, she&#8217;s definitely a villainous woman&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The story of the birth of the Great King who went down in history had unexpectedly gone the villain route.</p>



<p>Well, I guess this is the way it is.</p>



<p>The evil Great King who shakes the world and the powerful person who controls her from the shadow&#8230; If I do say so myself, what a flexible turnaround, it&#8217;s splendid.</p>



<p>&#8220;And there are some fishy rumors about former President Rose.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, that&#8217;s right. I heard that she is connected behind the scenes with an organization called Shadow Garden or something like that――&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi Jaga, if you say anything more, it&#8217;s dangerous.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hyoro interrupted Jaga.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oops, that&#8217;s right. I was about to get erased for talking about this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? What do you mean, &#8220;erased&#8221;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;During the winter break, four of the academy&#8217;s students went missing. Rumor has it that it was the work of the organization that took over the school before.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hyoro, making a serious face, says, and Jaga also says in a frightened voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re burying the students who tried to investigate the organization in the dark&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, I wonder if they do that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, they won&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>



<p>Jaga change his attitude and pretended to be relaxed.</p>



<p>&#8220;The students suddenly disappeared, so everyone is playing around with conspiracy theories. The Knights investigated just in case, but there were no traces of intruders anywhere.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time for those who have dropped their academic credits to escape reality. They didn&#8217;t disappear, they ran away. Jaga, are you going to be okay with your academic credits?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ugh, Well, just barely. What about you, Hyoro-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;M-Mine is so so, what about you, Sid?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Somehow, I can manage&#8230; I guess?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I see. I&#8217;m glad that everyone seems to be able to advance.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Y-Y-You&#8217;re right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, what are we going to do after this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We don&#8217;t have classes today, just the opening ceremony. So why don&#8217;t we play cards in the dormitory?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, playing cards?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This, this is a new product from Mitsugoshi Company!&#8221;</p>



<p>What Hyoro, with a smug look on his face, pulled out of his pocket was the very playing cards I had often seen in my previous life. I had no idea that such a thing had even been commercialized.</p>



<p>&#8220;I got it from Nina-senpai. Let&#8217;s play <em>d</em><em>a</em><em>i</em><em>f</em><em>u</em><em>g</em><em>o</em> or poker!&#8221; <em>(</em><em>T</em><em>L</em><em>N</em><em>:</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>s</em><em>o</em><em> </em><em>k</em><em>n</em><em>o</em><em>w</em><em>n</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>T</em><em>y</em><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>,</em><em> </em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em> </em><em>J</em><em>a</em><em>p</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>e</em><em>s</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>s</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em>d</em><em>d</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em><em>&#8211;</em><em>t</em><em>y</em><em>p</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>c</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>d</em><em> </em><em>g</em><em>a</em><em>m</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>f</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em> </em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em> </em><em>m</em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>a</em><em>y</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>a</em><em>y</em><em>e</em><em>d</em><em> </em><em>w</em><em>i</em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em> </em><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>d</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>d</em><em> </em><em>5</em><em>2</em><em>&#8211;</em><em>c</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>d</em><em> </em><em>p</em><em>a</em><em>c</em><em>k</em><em>.</em><em> </em><em>T</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>o</em><em>b</em><em>j</em><em>e</em><em>c</em><em>t</em><em>i</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em> </em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>g</em><em>a</em><em>m</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>i</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>t</em><em>o</em><em> </em><em>g</em><em>e</em><em>t</em><em> </em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>d</em><em> </em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em>l</em><em>l</em><em> </em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>c</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>d</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>h</em><em>a</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>f</em><em>a</em><em>s</em><em>t</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>p</em><em>o</em><em>s</em><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>b</em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>b</em><em>y</em><em> </em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>a</em><em>y</em><em>i</em><em>n</em><em>g</em><em> </em><em>p</em><em>r</em><em>o</em><em>g</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>s</em><em>s</em><em>i</em><em>v</em><em>e</em><em>l</em><em>y</em><em> </em><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>r</em><em>o</em><em>n</em><em>g</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em> </em><em>c</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>d</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em> </em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>o</em><em>s</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em> </em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>p</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><em>v</em><em>i</em><em>o</em><em>u</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>p</em><em>l</em><em>a</em><em>y</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>)</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Sid is playing cards for the first time today. Let&#8217;s show him how tough the world of competition is.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufufu&#8230;&#8230; Then it&#8217;s poker. Let&#8217;s rip off all the money he has.&#8221;</p>



<p>Poker, huh?</p>



<p>Probably Texas Hold&#8217;em. These are the rules of poker that I taught Seven Shades a long time ago.</p>



<p>I have good memories of taking the girls&#8217; money and making them cry half the time.</p>



<p>I taught the kids the harshness of society, so it&#8217;s only right that I get a generous lesson fee&#8230;&#8230; They quickly became stronger, so I ran away with the win.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a good opportunity, so let&#8217;s get the lesson fee from Hyoro and Jaga as well.</p>



<p>I snapped my fingers,</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll take it. Let&#8217;s see if you can teach me the harshness of the competition.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The rate is ten times higher than usual. I&#8217;m getting extra income.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>T</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>d</em><em>u</em><em>c</em><em>k</em><em> </em><em>h</em><em>a</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>c</em><em>a</em><em>r</em><em>r</em><em>i</em><em>e</em><em>d</em><em> </em><em>t</em><em>h</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>l</em><em>e</em><em>e</em><em>k</em>&#8221; <em>(</em><em>T</em><em>L</em><em>N</em><em>:</em><em> </em><em>I</em><em>t</em><em> </em><em>m</em><em>e</em><em>a</em><em>n</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>“</em><em>W</em><em>h</em><em>a</em><em>t</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em> </em><em>s</em><em>t</em><em>r</em><em>o</em><em>k</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>o</em><em>f</em><em> </em><em>l</em><em>u</em><em>c</em><em>k</em><em>!</em><em>”</em><em> </em><em>o</em><em>r</em><em> </em><em>“</em><em>H</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>e</em><em> </em><em>c</em><em>o</em><em>m</em><em>e</em><em>s</em><em> </em><em>a</em><em> </em><em>s</em><em>u</em><em>c</em><em>k</em><em>e</em><em>r</em><em>”</em><em>)</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Fuu&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Oops, close call. I covered my mouth with my hand.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>

<p>Poker ended up being played in my room.</p>



<p>The sun is already setting, and Jaga is staring at the ceiling with a soul-less face, having lost all his money.</p>



<p>I picked up a plentiful supply of chips,</p>



<p>&#8220;Raise&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Gununu&#8230;&#8230;.. A-All in.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hyoro bet all of his few remaining chips.</p>



<p>Naturally, I make the call.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kukuku&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; You&#8217;ve fallen into my trap.&#8221;</p>



<p>Chuckling, Hyoro showed his cards.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see, that&#8217;s a good move.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid, sorry, but I&#8217;ve learned all your actions. This is where the reversal begins——&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——No, it&#8217;s over.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh?&#8221;</p>



<p>I showed him my cards.</p>



<p>&#8220;No way&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s a three-card&#8230; The poker I worked out with Jaga, so easily&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;With debt, I can still fight, I just need to get my living expenses back for this month or&#8230;&#8230; Dead&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Jaga was muttering something in a raspy voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Collect the money, collect the money&#8221;</p>



<p>I collected the money from the two desperate men and kicked them out into the hallway.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I have no business with people who have no money.&#8221;</p>



<p>I say that and close the door.</p>



<p>From the hallway, &#8220;Damn it, remember this!&#8221; &#8220;Next time, let&#8217;s set him up with some cheating!&#8221; can be heard noisy voices.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s what you want, I&#8217;ll welcome you with cheating too. Even Alpha couldn&#8217;t see through my serious cheating.</p>



<p>I put the money I collected into the &#8220;The Eminence in Shadow Military Fund Box&#8221; and turned the lamp light down.</p>



<p>For a while, I listen to the sounds of the night.</p>



<p>Then I called out to the darkness outside the window.</p>



<p>&#8220;I made you wait, you can come in.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Nn.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a small reply, a girl appeared from somewhere.</p>



<p>Quite a stealth skill. You&#8217;ve improved your skills, Zeta.</p>



<p>She is a slender beastman dressed in a jet black bodysuit. She stares at me with cat-like ice-purple eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Long time no see, Master.&#8221; <em>(</em><em>T</em><em>L</em><em>N</em><em>:</em><em> </em><em>A</em><em>r</em><em>u</em><em>j</em><em>i</em><em>)</em></p>



<p>&#8220;Un, it&#8217;s been a while.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A little taller.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn.&#8221;</p>



<p>She gave a small nod.</p>



<p>Then she offers a dried fish.</p>



<p>&#8220;Souvenirs&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Souvenirs&#8230;..?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A horse mackerel&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a horse mackerel.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I went offshore to catch it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was hard, wasn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s fatty. The best horse mackerel of the season.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>She is a cat beastman and the sixth seven shades.</p>



<p>Zeta is smart for a beastman. And a cool person who doesn&#8217;t talk much.</p>



<p>It is the exact opposite of a certain dog.</p>



<p>Zeta stares at me as I accept the dried horse mackerel.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s like a cat waiting to be fed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you. I&#8217;ll grill it and eat it later.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta wagged her golden tail a little happily.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>I suddenly made a serious face.</p>



<p>&#8220;So——has there been any progress on the case?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I asked her, her cat-like eyes became very confident.</p>



<p>&#8220;The movement of the cult is as expected&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——Fumu.&#8221;</p>



<p>I stand by the window and hold a wine glass in one hand.</p>



<p>Zeta moves quickly and pours wine into my glass.</p>



<p>Nice moves as always. This is the spy act that Zeta loves to play. She has always been good at stealth and infiltration.</p>



<p>&#8220;The right arm is being revived.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The hand of Diabolos is about to wither. The cause of all this is there.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——So, is there?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The sealed right arm is in the ruins of the academy&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——As expected&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They are getting impatient. They&#8217;re afraid we&#8217;re going to intervene.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——It&#8217;s within expectations.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s not much time left. We&#8217;ll definitely make a move.&#8221;</p>



<p>After saying that, Zeta looked up at me as if asking for instructions.</p>



<p>Before I knew it, materials written in ancient characters were spread out on my desk&#8230;&#8230; though I can&#8217;t read it.</p>



<p>&#8220;What about the missing students?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not yet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Four people, huh&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It won&#8217;t be enough.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Probably.&#8221;</p>



<p>We squinted at each other to give the impression that we were sensing something, and looked out the window at the lights of the girls&#8217; dormitory.</p>



<p>&#8220;——There&#8217;s going to be a fifth victim.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230;&#8230; What do we do?&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta looks at me with an upward glance.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t care.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Zeta, you&#8217;ll find out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm&#8230;&#8230; What?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The future&#8230;&#8230; and beyond that, what needs to be done&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; If Master desires it.&#8221;</p>



<p>A solemn atmosphere flowed between us.</p>



<p>It was nice of me to improvise and connect it to the missing student case to create a sense of reality.</p>



<p>Behind the peaceful school life, the Diabolos cult&#8217;s grand plan is in motion——Me and Zeta look at each other as if we understand each other.</p>



<p>I nodded, and Zeta nodded too.</p>



<p>&#8220;Master, leave it to me. I will surely find it out.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then, with a gust of wind, she disappeared into the darkness of the night.</p>



<p>But I didn&#8217;t miss Zeta&#8217;s unnecessary behavior. She rubbed her golden tail on the bed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even though I already told her to stop with the marking.&#8221;</p>



<p>I brush off the hair and look up at the night sky.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eternal darkness or waking up from eternity——&#8221;</p>



<p>I muttered to myself, with the thought that it was late today, so I&#8217;d better get a good night&#8217;s sleep and wake up feeling good tomorrow.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>

<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll never forgive him!&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire Kagenoh puffed out her cheeks in her room in the girls&#8217; dormitory.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid, how many times do you have to break your promises? Even though we promised to go home together on winter break&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The lamp light illuminates her somewhat sulking figure.</p>



<p>She had a steel collar for some reason.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will never, ever forgive you. I&#8217;m dragging you back for spring break.&#8221;</p>



<p>She played with the collar and laughed when she made sure it was properly locked.</p>



<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t run away next time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——Tsu&#8221;</p>



<p>At that moment, she frowned.</p>



<p>The collar falls to the floor with a heavy thud.</p>



<p>&#8220;My right hand&#8230;&#8230; hurts&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>She held her right hand and her face contorted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why&#8230;&#8230; even though it had been subsiding lately.&#8221;</p>



<p>Since that day when the magic circle was engraved on her right hand, she had been feeling aching a few times.</p>



<p>But lately, things should have calmed down.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is this&#8230;&#8230; Aurora, answer me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even though she asks, Aurora has never responded to her since that day.</p>



<p>Could it be, she thought, that it was all just a dream.</p>



<p>But under the bandage wrapped around her right hand, the magic circle is indeed engraved.</p>



<p>Claire opens a desk drawer and spreads the materials out on the desk.</p>



<p>&#8220;I did some research. The fact that the same magic circle as mine is engraved in the documents of the Devil Diabolos.&#8221;</p>



<p>The magic circle depicted on the unfolded document and the magic circle engraved on her right hand bear a striking resemblance.</p>



<p>&#8220;What does this mean&#8230;&#8230; What connection do Diabolos and I have? What will happen to me? Hey, please, answer me&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>At that moment, she thought she heard something.</p>



<p>Claire raises her head and looks around.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, now&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;ay!]</p>



<p>&#8220;! Aurora!? Is it Aurora?&#8221;</p>



<p>A voice that seems to echo directly into her head.</p>



<p>[&#8230;&#8230;Ru&#8230;&#8230;way&#8230;&#8230;da&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>Little by little, she can hear it clearly.</p>



<p>[Run away&#8230;&#8230;danger&#8230;&#8230;]</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh&#8230;&#8230;? Run away?&#8221;</p>



<p>Just as Claire&#8217;s expression of bewilderment appeared on her face, there was a cracking sound like something cracking.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is this&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>The landscape in her eyes was cracked.</p>



<p>The world collapses like a broken mirror shattering.</p>



<p>Even the desk she tried to grab at the moment is shattered.</p>



<p>And beyond the shatters, a new world unfolded.</p>



<p>&#8220;My room&#8230;..isn&#8217;t it&#8221;</p>



<p>No doubt it was her own room.</p>



<p>However, for some reason, there is a strange white mist in the air.</p>



<p>The sound is somewhat distant, and only Claire&#8217;s breathing can be heard.</p>



<p>No——Behind her, she heard the faint rustling of clothes.</p>



<p>&#8220;——Naive&#8221;</p>



<p>The next moment, Claire turned around and released an elbow that shattered the attacker&#8217;s jaw.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gugah&#8221;</p>



<p>The assailant nearly collapsed to his knees, but he barely stayed on his feet.</p>



<p>But that turned out to be a mistake.</p>



<p>Claire&#8217;s knee slammed into his face, which was in just the right position.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid&#8217;s direct teachings.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a flutter, the skirt of the uniform danced.</p>



<p>The man collapses on the floor, unconscious with white eyes.</p>



<p>She doesn&#8217;t recognize him.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder who he is&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire crouched down to examine the man.</p>



<p>But suddenly, the man&#8217;s body cracks and shatters.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wha, the same as earlier&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>All traces of the man were gone.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is this? Hey someone! Anybody here?!&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire stepped out into the hallway and opened the door to the next room.</p>



<p>But the familiar schoolmates are nowhere to be seen.</p>



<p>The one next to it, and the one next to it.</p>



<p>There is no one.</p>



<p>Claire was the only one left in this world.</p>



<p>&#8220;What does this mean&#8230; Hey, Aurora, you&#8217;re here, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>[I am not]</p>



<p>She said with a troublesome voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re here, aren&#8217;t you? This is no time for jokes.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Even though I told you to run away.]</p>



<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped. No way I could move on the spur of the moment like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>[I&#8217;m reluctant.]</p>



<p>&#8220;This is an emergency!&#8221;</p>



<p>[I have my circumstances, too.]</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the circumstances?&#8221;</p>



<p>[I didn&#8217;t want to drag you into this.]</p>



<p>&#8220;――! &nbsp;It&#8217;s a little late for that, isn&#8217;t it, you carved this kind of magic circle!&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire stared at the magic circle on her right hand.</p>



<p>[It was to protect you.]</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand, but you could at least tell me the reason.&#8221;</p>



<p>[I was going to tell you. But now I can&#8217;t.]</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Because he&#8217;s trying to protect you.]</p>



<p>&#8220;He&#8230;..?&#8221;</p>



<p>[He&#8217;s trying to protect you. He&#8217;s trying to keep you out of danger. That&#8217;s why I can&#8217;t talk.]</p>



<p>&#8220;You said it before, but who is he? I don&#8217;t think anyone is protecting me.&#8221;</p>



<p>[You have always been protected. Always have been, always will be. Always, even to the point of making me envy you.]</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;..I&#8217;ll say it again. I don&#8217;t know who he is, but I have no intention of being protected by anyone.&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire&#8217;s voice was filled with anger.</p>



<p>[That&#8217;s fine. As long as you stay safe and don&#8217;t know anything. Because that&#8217;s probably what he wants——]</p>



<p>&#8220;——That&#8217;s enough! I don&#8217;t want that!&#8221;</p>



<p>[I never talk about it. Because I owe him a great debt.]</p>



<p>Aurora&#8217;s voice is also somewhat displeased.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll definitely make you talk.&#8221;</p>



<p>[How?]</p>



<p>&#8220;Etto&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Claire suddenly calmed down.</p>



<p>I wondered what can she do to the person who only echoes the voice in her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;Etto&#8230;&#8230; Etto. I&#8217;m going to keep yelling loudly until Aurora speaks.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Feel free to do so]</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll break ties with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Go ahead.]</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll speak ill of you.&#8221;</p>



<p>[So what?]</p>



<p>Claire bit her lip in annoyance.</p>



<p>[Are you done now?]</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m getting more irritated.&#8221;</p>



<p>[Rest assured, I can tell you how to get out of this space.]</p>



<p>&#8220;What is this place anyway?&#8221;</p>



<p>[I can&#8217;t tell you that.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Aah, mou, it&#8217;s already annoying.&#8221;</p>



<p>[For now, just go straight ahead.]</p>



<p>&#8220;No.&#8221;</p>



<p>[If you don&#8217;t move on, you&#8217;ll be stuck in here for the rest of your life.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I understand. I just need to go ahead, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>[Yes, yes, go ahead and make three turns.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Three turns?!&#8221;</p>



<p>[Just kidding.]</p>



<p>&#8220;Someday I&#8217;m going to blow you away.&#8221;</p>



<p>The black-haired girl walked out into a world of white fog.</p>



<p>Behind her, a woman with violet eyes could be seen overlapping faintly.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>

<p>Classes for the third semester begin today.</p>



<p>Perhaps because the exams at the end of the school year are approaching, everyone in the class seems to be somewhat serious.</p>



<p>&#8220;I heard that today&#8217;s class on the theory of magic manipulation will be on the test every year.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As expected of Jaga, you&#8217;re well informed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to get serious, because if I don&#8217;t, it will be bad. If I repeat the year, my parents will kill me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s time for me to get serious. I guess I cut corners a little too much.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If I put my mind to it, I can easily manage it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If I put my mind to it, I can easily manage it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hyoro and Jaga&#8217;s eyes were bloodshot.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid, you&#8217;re not getting good grades either, are you? It&#8217;s time to get serious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah~ you&#8217;re right, I&#8217;ll get serious too.&#8221;</p>



<p>I keep my grades around the lower middle.</p>



<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t know most of the tests because I&#8217;m usually training magic during class.</p>



<p>But if I&#8217;m serious, I can cheat very easily, so there&#8217;s no problem.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t even know the content of today&#8217;s class, but my training is proof of the &#8220;Theory of a Thousandfold Increase in Power through Magic Compression&#8221;.</p>



<p>This is also the training to become the &#8220;Eminence in Shadow&#8221;.</p>



<p>I secretly tried to train my magic as usual.</p>



<p>——At that time.</p>



<p>The classroom door rattled open and a silver-haired girl appeared.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s Alexia.</p>



<p>&#8220;The weather is nice today.&#8221;</p>



<p>I said so and casually looked up at the sky outside the window.</p>



<p>It was cloudy.</p>



<p>I could feel the eyes of the whole class on me.</p>



<p>When Alexia comes, everyone looks at me for some reason. I&#8217;m just an ordinary, plain mob guy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, there&#8217;s a bird flying in the sky.&#8221;</p>



<p>Ordinary everyday scenery is in the sky.</p>



<p>&#8220;Look over here, Pochi.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The clouds are being swept away by the wind&#8221;</p>



<p>And so the day would pass peacefully.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t ignore me.&#8221;</p>



<p>She grabbed me by the chin.</p>



<p>Crack crack, I heard a weird noise coming from my neck, and she forced me to turn around.</p>



<p>Alexia&#8217;s red eyes are right in front of me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yaa~, Princess Alexia.&#8221;</p>



<p>I greeted her in a mob-like manner.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello, Sid Kagenoh-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you coming to the wrong class, Princess Alexia?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not mistaken. I was looking for you, Sid Kagenoh-kun&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, the class is about to start. I&#8217;m sorry, but we&#8217;ll continue another time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It doesn&#8217;t matter. I&#8217;m going to borrow this guy for a moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia said to Hyoro and Jaga and grabbed me by the neck.</p>



<p>&#8220;Go-go-go-go ahyead&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-A-As you wiish!&#8221;</p>



<p>Listening to their heartless voices, I was taken away.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>

<p>For some reason, I was taken to a girls&#8217; dormitory.</p>



<p>&#8220;Can we come in without permission?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve got permission.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But I&#8217;m a boy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay because you&#8217;re related to her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Related to her?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia stopped in front of the door.</p>



<p>If I remember correctly, this is Claire-neesan&#8217;s room.</p>



<p>&#8220;Your big sister, apparently she didn&#8217;t show up for breakfast.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A concerned student paid a visit and found the room unlocked.&#8221;</p>



<p>With that said, when Alexia opened the door, the room was indeed empty.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think we went through all the places she might have gone, but she was nowhere to be found.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ho~n.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you have any idea?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I answered immediately, Alexia looked at me with a look that said, &#8220;Is this guy okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aren&#8217;t you worried?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It often happens.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Often?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Since childhood, she has often gone missing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s called having an idea.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Indeed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Where did your missing sister go?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who knows, because she&#8217;d come back on her own.&#8221;</p>



<p>After the Seven Shades came, they rescued my big sister.</p>



<p>Zeta must have been nearby this time. Zeta is a good person, so if there is no action from her, it must be okay.</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess it&#8217;s like running away from home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Maybe.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope it&#8217;s simply a run away from home, but I&#8217;m a little concerned about something.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you concerned about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Look at this.&#8221;</p>



<p>Entering the room, Alexia picked up the collar from the floor.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that a collar? It looks pretty sturdy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And it also has an effect of sealing the magic. It&#8217;s not something you&#8217;d find in the normal schoolgirl&#8217;s room.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Whether nee-san is normal or not is disputable.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Someone may have broken into this room and tried to take her away using a collar.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But the collar fell right here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Perhaps they dropped it when struggling. And there&#8217;s one more thing that bothers me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, Alexia looked down at the materials on the desk.</p>



<p>The moment I saw it, I guessed.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Ancient letters, cool magic circles, spells that seem to make sense but don&#8217;t make sense at all.</p>



<p>This is <em>that</em>.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a black history notebook of chuunibyou.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you have any idea?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, not at all. I don&#8217;t have any idea about any of this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? Your eyes are swimming.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-It must be your imagination.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I hope so.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia turned her attention back to the black history notebook of chuunibyou again.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think she wrote anything that makes sense.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia is seriously examining the notes.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, all that is written there is black history.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, the magic seal collar is also a chuunibyou item, and my sister used to play with writing a chuunibyou magic circle on her right hand and hiding it with a bandage.</p>



<p>Maybe nee-san&#8217;s chuunibyou sickness has finally been triggered in full blown.</p>



<p>Sudden disappearance is one of the most common symptoms of chuunibyou sickness.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure nee-san is fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see you trust her&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I trust her or rather &#8230;&#8230; Well.&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s unavoidable that she has been triggered.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8230; My onee-sama&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia narrowed her eyes, as if she was looking somewhere far away.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know what my big sister is thinking these days.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Did Pochi also experience the same thing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know most of what my big sister is thinking.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so &#8230;&#8230; I wonder if people don&#8217;t get it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re strangers related by blood.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s a ruthless way of saying it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wish I could understand her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia let out a small sigh.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; You can go back to class now. I&#8217;ll look into it a little more.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn.&#8221;</p>



<p>I walked away, leaving Alexia doing serious investigation on black history notebook of chuunibyou.</p>

<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>

<p>In the end, it seems that nee-san didn&#8217;t come back even after school.</p>



<p>Well, Zeta is here, and if something happens, it won&#8217;t be a problem.</p>



<p>I am in the backyard of the dorm, grilling dried horse mackerel that Zeta gave me. It&#8217;s already past lights out and it&#8217;s dark.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s ready to roast.&#8221;</p>



<p>The crackling and delicious sound of horse mackerel fat falling onto the fire.</p>



<p>&#8220;Should I grill it a little more?&#8221;</p>



<p>It is not so bad to make an open fire alone like this.</p>



<p>It purifies the mind. People rot their hearts just by being alive.</p>



<p>As I gazed at the fire in a daze, I felt a presence approaching at a ridiculously fast pace.</p>



<p>&#8220;Boss!! I finally found you!!&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Delta who appeared, wiggling her dog ears.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yaa~. It&#8217;s late at night, so let&#8217;s be quiet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Delta hunted the black jaguar!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. It&#8217;s late at night, so let&#8217;s be quiet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then Alpha-sama praised me!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so. It&#8217;s late at night, so let&#8217;s be quiet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want my boss to praise me too!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yo~shi yoshi. Good girl.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I patted her head softly, Delta&#8217;s tail wagged.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s late at night, so let&#8217;s be quiet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be quiet!&#8221;</p>



<p>Replying energetically, Delta hurriedly covered her mouth with her hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Delta will speaks in a small voice.&#8221;</p>



<p>In a whispered voice, Delta said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Unn, do that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Delta dug the hole as Boss told me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Little by little, her voice becomes louder.</p>



<p>&#8220;A hole? Did I say that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You said it!&#8221;</p>



<p>Her voice went back to usual.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so. Well, fine&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I found this! It&#8217;s just like the boss said! It&#8217;s amazing!&#8221;</p>



<p>Delta smiled and chewed on what looked like a bright red gem.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you chewing it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So I don&#8217;t lose it!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a genius idea.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nishishi&#8221;</p>



<p>When I received the gem covered in delta saliva, it shone so beautifully red.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is&#8230;&#8230; Oh, it might sell for a high price.&#8221;</p>



<p>The size is about that of marble, but the brilliance is extraordinary.</p>



<p>&#8220;Delta did her best!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yo~shi yoshi. Good girl.&#8221;</p>



<p>I patted Delta&#8217;s head messily.</p>



<p>Delta has a melting smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want a reward!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, it smells delicious!&#8221;</p>



<p>The moment I looked toward the fire, the horse mackerel disappeared.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this Delta&#8217;s reward?&#8221;</p>



<p>Delta was holding it.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s a Zeta souvenir&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you!&#8221;</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t listen.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s delicious~&#8221;</p>



<p>Delta looks happy as she takes a bite.</p>



<p>Well, it looks like Delta did a great job.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, well.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just when I thought that, I heard the snapping sound of a tree branch breaking behind me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Doggie&#8230;&#8230; What are you eating?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I turned around, I saw Zeta standing there with icy cold eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, female cat!! Delta is eating her reward!&#8221;</p>



<p>Garuru, Delta, with its gurgling, throaty, menacing voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;That horse mackerel I gave to Master. It&#8217;s not yours, doggie&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Go away! This is Delta&#8217;s reward!&#8221;</p>



<p>After saying so, Delta swallowed the horse mackerel whole.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta&#8217;s scream, like a sigh.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was delicious~&#8221;</p>



<p>Nonchalant Delta.</p>



<p>&#8220;This&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fuuh, Zeta&#8217;s throat rumbled.</p>



<p>&#8220;The female cat is in the way, If you don&#8217;t go away, I&#8217;ll blow you away!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even though I prepared the best horse mackerel for Master &#8230;&#8230; I won&#8217;t forgive you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, well, well.&#8221;</p>



<p>Sensing that it was going to be a somewhat troublesome situation, I intervened between the two of them.</p>



<p>Their gazes focused on me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Etto&#8230;&#8230; I was just grilling horse mackerels as usual, and there is no evidence that I gave it to anyone else——&#8221;</p>



<p>When things become bothersome, the first thing to do is to protect yourself.</p>



<p>It is important to appeal that it is not your fault and that you have nothing to do with it in order not to get involved.</p>



<p>&#8220;——So it&#8217;s not my fault.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn, it&#8217;s not Master&#8217;s fault.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Boss is not to blame!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right right, it&#8217;s not my fault.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was taking good care of the horse mackerels. It was just an unfortunate misunderstanding that resulted in it being eaten.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8221;That&#8217;s why——&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta and Delta point at each other,</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8221;——It&#8217;s her fault!&#8221;&#8221;</p>



<p>They said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Heh?&#8221;</p>



<p>The next moment, their magic power exploded.</p>



<p>I was blown away by the blast and flew through the air in a spectacular manner.</p>



<p>When the impact was cleared and I landed, Zeta and Delta had also landed a short distance away.</p>



<p>&#8220;A stupid dog who stole the gift for Master &#8230;&#8230; I will never forgive you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The female cat that messed with Delta&#8217;s reward &#8230;&#8230; I will never forgive you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah~ etto, I don&#8217;t know what it is, but it&#8217;s not my fault.&#8221;</p>



<p>I quietly moved away.</p>



<p>The two had always been incompatible and fought frequently. The house and farm were half destroyed, and Alpha would be so mad that even she would lose her temper.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t overdo it, but in moderation.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a blessing in disguise that the blast left the dormitory.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll beat it out of you.&#8221;</p>

<p>Delta readies her sword and gets into a battle stance.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll punish you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta narrowed her cold eyes —— and she disappeared.</p>



<p>Without warning, she disappeared without a trace.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did she run away?&#8221;</p>



<p>Delta tilts her head.</p>



<p>At that moment, a black blade appeared behind Delta.</p>



<p>&#8220;——&#8221;</p>



<p>Just before being slashed, Delta dodge.</p>



<p>She dodged recklessly and rolled on the ground.</p>



<p>There, zan zan zan, black blades raining down.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Fuh&#8221;</p>



<p>Delta avoided all of them.</p>



<p>She crawled on the ground, flipped, and jumped with movements that were almost impossible for a human being to perform.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Where are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta is nowhere to be seen.</p>



<p>Only countless black blades floated in the darkness.</p>



<p>——This is it. It&#8217;s the &#8220;Blood Queen&#8217;s&#8221; technique.</p>



<p>I never thought Zeta could do it, but I feel like she would.</p>



<p>Zeta is the most dexterous person I have met.</p>



<p>No matter what I ask her to do, she can handle it all with dexterity, even if it&#8217;s her first time doing it. And so, she&#8217;s growing fast, she&#8217;s got a great sense, and she may be the ultimate genius type.</p>



<p>Her talent alone is top-notch.</p>



<p>But there&#8217;s a big flaw in Zeta&#8217;s &#8220;talent&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Areh?&#8221;</p>



<p>It&#8217;s Zeta&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p>Her tail was floating in the darkness.</p>



<p>Same as always.</p>



<p>She is capricious, easily bored, and incapable of mastering a single art.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh shoot, lack of practice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——That&#8217;s where you are!&#8221;</p>



<p>Just before Delta&#8217;s powerful sword cut her in two, her tail turned into a black mist and disappeared into the darkness.</p>



<p>&#8220;Dangerous. It&#8217;s so close&#8221;</p>



<p>Only Zeta&#8217;s voice can be heard.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m going to get serious a little bit.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying that, the black mist gathered and created more than 10,000 small blades.</p>



<p>Small blades surround Delta and soar.</p>



<p>&#8220;Technique, a thousand blades.&#8221;</p>



<p>It is a modest declaration, even though it clearly exceeds 10,000.</p>



<p>But its killing power was tremendous.</p>



<p>More than 10,000 blades slice through Delta, sending her body into the air.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gah, Guh&#8230;&#8230;Guuh&#8221;</p>



<p>Delta is slashed one-sidedly in the night sky.</p>



<p>It seems that she barely protects her vital points with her limbs, but it may be a little dangerous.</p>



<p>Zeta is stronger than I thought.</p>



<p>Even though she&#8217;s a newcomer to the &#8220;Seven Shades,&#8221; but she&#8217;s a monster who has grown at a breakneck speed&#8230;&#8230;</p>



<p>&#8220;GugaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&#8221;</p>



<p>The roar of Delta thundered through the air.</p>



<p>Tremendous magic power rushes through as a shockwave.</p>



<p>And ten thousand blades were erased.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh&#8230;&#8230;Lies.&#8221;</p>



<p>A dumbfounded Zeta fell from the mist.</p>



<p>She landed like a cat, and her gaze was on the bloody Delta.</p>



<p>Splat.</p>



<p>Delta spat out a clump of blood and glared at Zeta.</p>



<p>The color of playfulness disappeared from her eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>Every hair on Zeta&#8217;s body stood on end.</p>



<p>Delta manipulates slime and creates a giant black sword.</p>



<p>No, it&#8217;s too rugged and huge to be called a sword. We used to call it the &#8220;Lump of Iron&#8221; of Delta.</p>



<p>Delta usually imitates us and fights with similar weapons.</p>



<p>But that&#8217;s not what her real style is like.</p>



<p>This massive lump of iron is her true weapon, and proof that the &#8220;Tyrant&#8221; Delta is serious.</p>



<p>&#8220;Gurururu&#8221;</p>



<p>Delta growled low in the back of her throat.</p>



<p>Cold sweat dripped down Zeta&#8217;s cheeks.</p>



<p>I turned around and worried about the dormitory and the school building.</p>



<p>What should I do, I feel like she is going to blow the place up.</p>



<p>But it would be so annoying to be stopped in the middle of a grueling battle.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s not do to others what I don&#8217;t like to have done to me.</p>



<p>So, goodbye Midgar Academy, and rest in peace, Hyoro and Jaga.</p>



<p>I held my hands together in my heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kill&#8221;</p>



<p>The magic power of serious Delta gathers in the iron lump.</p>



<p>I take a distance with a relatively serious back step.</p>



<p>And Zeta is&#8230;&#8230; flew in the sky.</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t metaphorical or anything, she simply flew purely in the sky.</p>



<p>When I look at her with enhanced vision, I can see that she is covered with a fine black mist.</p>



<p>Is it possible to use it that way?</p>



<p>&#8220;Bye Bye, doggie.&#8221;</p>



<p>With these words, she took flight and disappeared into the clouds.</p>



<p>After a momentary pause, Delta roars, her whole body shaking with anger.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-Wait, female caAAAAAAAAAAAAAAT!!&#8221;</p>



<p>And Delta also disappeared, leaving behind a gust of wind.</p>



<p>&#8220;In the end, it&#8217;s the same as usual.&#8221;</p>



<p>Their fights have always been unsettled.</p>



<p>Either Zeta will run away or Alpha will get mad. By the way, I am a silent spectator.</p>



<p>Well, let&#8217;s go back and go to bed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>I noticed multiple signs of approaching.</p>



<p>Is it natural after all that fuss?</p>



<p>&#8220;This presence&#8230;&#8230; Alexia and her guards, I guess.&#8221;</p>



<p>I decided to erase my presence and see what was going on.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>

<p>Alexia was running in the backyard of the dormitory.</p>



<p>Even though it is called a backyard, it is a forest with trees and almost no maintenance. Her boots become damp with dew at night.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, hurry up!&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia looks back behind her as she runs.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alexia-sama, that magic power is dangerous! Let&#8217;s wait for the reinforcements!&#8221;</p>



<p>The guards were frantically pursuing Alexia.</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re going to get away from us because we&#8217;re being too leisurely.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please wait, Alexia-sama!&#8221;</p>



<p>She ignores the guards and rummages through the bushes.</p>



<p>There she found traces of the battle.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>A number of scratches have been carved into the ground, grass and trees.</p>



<p>There were traces of strong magic power.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who in the world has this much magic power&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alexia-sama! Ugh, this is&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>The guards who caught up with her choked on their voices due to the magic power.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s dangerous. The culprit may still be nearby.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s your job to catch them.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-That&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230; that &#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>The guards looked away and exchanged looks with each other.</p>



<p>Alexia sighs without noticing it.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is blood.&#8221;</p>



<p>She follows the blood stains on the grass.</p>



<p>&#8220;They&#8217;re bleeding a lot. Maybe they have deep wounds. Maybe it&#8217;s the culprit in the case in question&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>A case of a series of missing students rumored in the school.</p>



<p>The investigation by the Knights was sloppy. Several pieces of evidence were disregarded and deemed &#8220;no case&#8221;.</p>



<p>Alexia suspected that there was something behind the incident.</p>



<p>&#8220;First-class swordsmen fought here&#8230;&#8230; Why in this place?&#8221;</p>



<p>This is not a battlefield. It&#8217;s just the backyard of a student dormitory.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s natural to suspect a connection to the case. There is some great power behind it&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Alexia-sama.&#8221;</p>



<p>A panicked guard&#8217;s voice interrupts her thoughts.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O-Over there&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>A figure in a long jet-black coat stood where the guard pointed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since when&#8221;</p>



<p>They shudder at the fact that there was no sign of him at all.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-You&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>A figure with a deep hood wiped the bloodstains on the grass and trees with his fingertips.</p>



<p>Then he mutters in a voice that seems to echo from the depths.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is this the price of battle——&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shadow&#8230;..&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia&#8217;s words are stifled by his somewhat sad tone.</p>



<p>&#8220;Were the lives scattered here a necessary sacrifice for the world&#8230;..?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shadow, are you involved in this?&#8221;</p>



<p>Shadow was just immersed in deep thought, oblivious to the presence of Alexia and the others.</p>



<p>&#8220;A-A-Alexia-sama, it&#8217;s dangerous. Let&#8217;s retreat and call the knights——!&#8221;</p>



<p>The guards pull out their swords, trembling.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s no use, stand back. Our swords cannot reach him.&#8221;</p>



<p>Knowing that, Alexia pointed her sword at Shadow.</p>



<p>&#8220;Answer me, Shadow. What happened here?&#8221;</p>



<p>As she said that, and put magic power into her sword, Shadow finally turned around.</p>



<p>The red eyes behind the mask look at Alexia.</p>



<p>&#8220;——And what would you do if you knew that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll arrest you. I won&#8217;t let you do whatever you want.&#8221;</p>



<p>Shadow laughed a little behind his mask.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s useless.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, he disappeared.</p>



<p>No, he&#8217;s not.</p>



<p>He appeared in front of Alexia.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wha——?&#8221;</p>



<p>She could not feel his magic, his presence, or anything else.</p>



<p>The next thing she knew, he was right in front of her, holding a sword to Alexia&#8217;s throat.</p>



<p>The sword looks familiar.</p>



<p>Because it is her sword.</p>



<p>&#8220;My, sword&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t even realize that it has been taken away from her.</p>



<p>&#8220;——The world we live in is different.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What does that mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>She clenches her back teeth strongly.</p>



<p>She has been working hard since then.</p>



<p>She thought she had closed the gap a bit.</p>



<p>&#8220;Two sides of the world, there exists a world where people from shadow and light should not be involved with each other&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying that, he drew back his sword and turned away.</p>



<p>His long jet-black coat flutters as he walks slowly through the darkness of the night.</p>



<p>&#8220;——It&#8217;s time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Time? What are you talking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They started moving——&#8221;</p>



<p>A black liquid gushed out from under Shadow&#8217;s feet.</p>



<p>It swirls around and covers his body.</p>



<p>Then the wind blew, and Shadow disappeared into a black mist.</p>



<p>Only Alexia&#8217;s sword had fallen where he had been.</p>



<p>&#8220;He disappeared&#8230;&#8230; Who are &#8216;they&#8217;?&#8221;</p>



<p>There are so many things she doesn&#8217;t know.</p>



<p>Still, it is a step forward to know that Shadow is involved.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s a very small step.</p>



<p>Alexia mocks herself and turns around.</p>



<p>&#8220;The reinforcements are still not here? Quickly preserve the scene&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>She stood there aghast.</p>



<p>&#8220;No&#8230;&#8230;way&#8221;</p>



<p>All the guards were knocked unconscious.</p>



<p>Shadow used that split second to mow down the consciousness of all the guards.</p>



<p>She was totally unaware of it.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s still such a difference &#8230;&#8230; I also &#8230;&#8230; I also.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alexia looked down and clenched her fists tightly.</p>
