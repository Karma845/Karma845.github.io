<h1 style="text-align: center">Prologue</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In Akanedai High School, there are two famous female students that everybody knows.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One was Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She has a beautiful face and long black hair that must have taken a lot of time and effort to arrange. She wears a calm and mature look, a refined lady. Naturally, she was the object of admiration of many male students.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That very person was now right in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The setting was the library after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being a library committee member, I was on the counter and she was on the other side of it. We were talking across the counter. There’s still some time before closing, and several students are studying or reading in the room, so I lowered my voice slightly to avoid disturbing them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, she still spoke to me in a melodic and lucid manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess the number of people here will increase since the exams are soon?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying so, she then looked around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In short, the question was whether more students will use the library to study for the tests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, there doesn&#8217;t seem to be any visible increase… though, that may just be because of me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I chuckle.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I was the only member of the library committee. Thanks to this, the opening and closing of the library was entirely up to my convenience. It would be difficult to use the library for those reasons. The people who regularly come here can be counted with the number of my fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think so. You’re doing well as a member of the library committee. That&#8217;s right. Why don&#8217;t you just keep it closed until the tests are over? I’m sure you also have to study for the exams.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t exactly do that. Although there aren’t many, some students come here to study.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are some faces I don&#8217;t usually see. Perhaps they were visiting the library because they think that if they are going to study hard for a test, the library is a better place to study than their noisy homes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll be fine. I can study right here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, how unexpected.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then the bell rang. I didn&#8217;t need to look at my watch to know. The time was 5:55 pm. When the chime rings at 6:00 p.m, students who have nothing special to do should go home. This was a reminder bell to tell them to get ready to go home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Each of the students who remained in the library packed their belongings and left the room. As they did so, some students greeted the most beautiful senior student. She, too, responded with a mature smile and a wave of her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After seeing most of the students leave, Takinami-senpai spun around and turned back to the counter.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then―,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you see, about the summer vacation…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said in a very casual tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her graceful atmosphere was gone. However, this was the true face of Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought we were talking about the tests.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t care about those uninteresting things.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai nonchalantly said so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re a high achiever who can handle the test.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My courtesy for the upperclassmen was blown away by her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It doesn&#8217;t matter if the tests are a breeze or you have good grades, if it&#8217;s not interesting, it&#8217;s not interesting. Besides, a test is something you can do if you study hard and listen to your classes. It&#8217;s not an event to make a big deal out of.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected of an honor student. But, most of us can&#8217;t do that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, when she said that you could do well on the test if you studied hard, her excellent grades must be due to her hard work.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I don&#8217;t enjoy talking about tests either.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, I am an average person and always struggle with tests even though I take classes properly every day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then this should be fast… Can you help me pick out a swimsuit for summer vacation?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai casually said so.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Why should I?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You picked out my underwear the other day, didn’t you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">True, but that was simply a choice made out of the strength of a sales pitch and momentum, and I don&#8217;t want to do it again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You see, I like what you picked for me. You have a knack for this stuff that I don’t have.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai gave a plausible reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll make sure to treat you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Treat?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not that I would do it depending on the answer, but I reflexively asked her back. Then, Takinami-senpai confidently answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Next date, we&#8217;ll go to the pool and I&#8217;ll show you my swimsuit.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I refuse.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I curtly replied, swiveled my office chair, and turned my body to face the computer. I closed the unnecessary applications one by one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, you…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was when Takinami-senapi, who was very unhappy with my attitude, was about to say something to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, are you bothering Shizuru again? Cut it out, will you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice came from the library doorway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The owner of the voice has short brownish hair and large, round eyes that give off a lively impression. A high school girl who was on the verge of being a gal thanks to her makeup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi Shion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other girl that everyone here at Akanedai High School knew. She and Takinami Ruika are two of the most beautiful girls in our school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Hasumi-san, how unusual. For you to stay at school this late.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, no, I was talking in class and it was getting late, so I thought I&#8217;d come over here before I leave… to see if there was anything I could do to help, but that’s enough about me.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai, who had been explaining the circumstances as she was being asked, hastily returned to the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m the one who’s asking. Takinami-san, I hope you are not pressing Shizuru again.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How rude. A woman&#8217;s weapon is not something to be used rashly. You have to pull it out at the right moment.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai replied in a vexing manner, but for me it was more than enough trouble. Hasumi-senpai also looked a little dismayed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I was just consulting about something.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Consulting?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai looks doubtful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Summer vacation is coming, right? That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m asking Shizuru to pick out a swimsuit for me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you asking Shizuru to do that for you?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And now she has an irritated look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you before. Shizuru has a good sense for fashion. He made me realize that this kind of thing looks good on me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai, on the other hand, was somewhat proud.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But it was not my intention to create a new aspect of her. It was simply the result of my own consideration and choice. In the first place, Takinami Ruika would look good no matter what she wears.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since you&#8217;re already here, why don&#8217;t you have him pick something for you too, Hasumi-san?&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I told you I don’t need it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t intend to do that either. And please don&#8217;t say &#8220;too&#8221; as if I accepted Takinami-senpai’s request.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If that&#8217;s the case, why don’t I help you? How about a triangle bikini? How about it? It would look good on you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, you’re talking about that one, right? The kind that gravure idols wear. I don&#8217;t think that would look good on a normal person.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Says the one who could stand side by side with a gravure idol. She’s most definitely not an ordinary person, but a person who was blessed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I don&#8217;t think so. Even Shizuru would like to see it, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The conversation suddenly turns to me, and I couldn’t help but let out a sound in a deadpan manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um… well, I&#8217;d kind of like to see it…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then I thought about the question and uttered the answer in a subdued tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, since Hasumi-senpai has the body of a gravure idol and would dress like a gravure idol, it would be like the page on the magazine would come to life. If I had to choose between wanting to see it and not wanting to see it, I would choose to see it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after, Hasumi-senpai made a bright red face and grabbed me by the collar, and Takinami-senpai also leaned forward against the counter with a grim look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-yo-you… Why are you so brutally honest?! Don’t you think you should be ashamed, being the man that you are?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t mean to be rude after having talked about it myself, but wasn’t Shizuru&#8217;s reaction compared to mine, quite different?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next moment, something snapped in my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, so troublesome! You asked and I answered, and now you&#8217;re mad at me? Is this a trap? Go, I&#8217;m closing the library now, so both of you get the h**l out!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re as noisy as usual.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was taking a breath after taking Takinami-senpai and Hasumi-senapi out of the library together, I heard a voice from behind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, there stood a woman with jet-black hair, a beauty no less than Takinami Ruika and Hasumi Shion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her name is Mibu Kanata.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;ll remind them later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t really mind. It&#8217;s quite interesting to watch from the sidelines.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, this isn’t some show, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One would think that she was a recluse who doesn’t care about what was happening in the world, but she was surprisingly observant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;re having more fun than you think you do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does it look that way?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai would say things that I don&#8217;t understand, Hasumi-senpai gets involved, and the result was always a sludge fest. It was quite unthinkable to enjoy that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Poison is conquered by poison. Kanata-senpai, would you like to join us?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you expecting out of me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai looked at me with slanted eyes. She was as cold as ever.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m going home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Take care.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>
<p></span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And she didn&#8217;t mention anything about being called a poison.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai grabbed her school bag and left the library. As soon as she was out of sight, the book bell rang for 6 p.m. It was as if the chime was matching up with Kanata-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, then―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a sound and began closing the library.</span></p>
