<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 5: Makabe Shizuru Is Not Cut Out For Romance</b></h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 1</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Makabe Shizuru is stalking Takinami Ruika.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such rumors were being spread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More precisely, Makabe Shizuru is following her around, taking advantage of the fact that he’s a member of the library committee, and getting close to Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A guy in my class was kind enough to tell me. He also gave me advice, “Stop with the stalking.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They have no trust if I do say so myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But interestingly, there was no damage done.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the lunch break, after finishing my lunch, I looked around the classroom and said to Karube Kagemitsu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to a classmate of mine, rumors started circulating during yesterday&#8217;s lunch break and have spread quite a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But unfortunately, my name doesn’t ring any bells, so it halved the effectiveness of the rumor. After all, when someone hears that rumor, the first thing they would think of is who that guy is. In fact, when I went to the cafeteria to get a cup of coffee a few minutes ago, I didn&#8217;t hear anyone whispering anything to each other or blatantly pointing their finger behind my back when they saw my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rumors are more interesting the more famous the subjects are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s how it is.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube stated nonchalantly, and I nodded in return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why, rather than such half-baked rumors, the fact that Masaru-sensei used to be an aspiring opera singer is much more interesting. Masaru-sensei is a large man with a loud voice, and even when the doors and windows are closed, one can hear him speaking from the classroom next door. When I heard this story, I was deeply convinced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who do you think is the source of the rumors?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Naoi.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube responded immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahead of his gaze, Naoi&#8217;s group was happily making noise. There were less than ten people in the group, including several girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s possible.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had an argument with him just yesterday morning. That was enough to make him angry and give my name a bad stigma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But Naoi would never do such a thing.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">But the timing is just too good. If it really was Naoi&#8217;s work, I have to say that it was shortsighted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t understand why you regard Naoi so highly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Half of it is just my ideals.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ideal that this is how Naoi is supposed to be. I&#8217;m just imposing that ideal on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it’s not Naoi, then…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube then still looked at Naoi’s group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, who cares who did it? It will disappear soon. Especially since it’s not that interesting.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rumor has a short shelf life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the library after school that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was at the check-out counter with my textbooks spread out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, found the delinquent librarian.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I was called by such a nickname.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up and saw a beautiful senior student there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s more, a stalker.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She giggles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you hear about the rumors?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. How did that happen?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Takinami-senpai answered in this way, rather than tilting her head at the inexplicable, she seemed to be dismayed by the rumor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she has a good idea of where it came from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That said, if my stalker is Makabe-kun, I would welcome it with open arms.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think you should say that anywhere but here. You never know if some guy will misunderstand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reminded her, who was saying stuff in a playful manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shrugged her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so. I’ll be careful. By the way, are you studying?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I was having a hard time understanding something in class today.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, taking advantage of the lack of students coming to the counter, I was reviewing the textbooks here instead of doing it at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, but I&#8217;ll do the rest when I get home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I close the textbook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have come to some understanding. The bigger problem is that my work as a member of the library committee might be neglected. Just like now, I was unaware of Takininami-senpai’s presence. I had assumed that I would be able to tell when a person would approach, but it seems that I was inadvertently absorbed in what I was doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why? Why not just do it here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, you have a great teacher just in front of you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was looking only at Takinami-senpai, who was strangely cute and good at what she was doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you implying that you’re going to teach me?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. I’m quite good at academics if I do say so myself. Shall we go to the reading table?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai said that and walked toward the reading tables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was wondering what to do, she put her bag on the table by the window. She seemed to be sitting with her back to the counter. This would mean that I would be sitting with my back to the window, looking towards the counter. If someone comes in, they would be in my line of sight. If they are regulars, they might call out directly to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to take advantage of her kindness and quickly put a message on the counter, “Currently away.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We sat across from each other at the table. I spread out the textbook between us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, please do.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai smiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, wait a second.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed to have remembered something. Then she took an eyeglass case out of her bag. Naturally, there were glasses inside. They were slender and square-shaped, much like the ones I had seen at the store the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you buy one?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Of course, it’s just for show though. I never thought I would be able to use it so soon.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai smiled innocently as she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must not have been a cheap purchase, but she bought it for a performance she never knows when will happen. Well, I guess she was going to make this development happen somehow though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai unbuttoned the top button of her blouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry for the wait. Here, go ahead.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, wait a minute.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai stopped moving while leaning to look over the textbook. I can almost see something beyond her wide-open collar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean, what?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What if someone sees? Thinking so, I checked my surroundings and then realized. I realized that all the remaining students in the library were on the other side of the room. They could only see her backside even if they turned their head this way. I was the only one facing her from the front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, this?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai looks at her own chest.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought it would motivate you. Being a serious yet alluring teacher.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the contrary, I’m so concerned about it that what I would be taught is bound to pass from my right ear to my left ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Don’t you expect a reward afterward? Like, ‘Well done, alright, it’s time for the reward you’ve been waiting for.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then smiled meaningfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But soon, her face turns serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, get to it. Are you really motivated to do this?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s my line.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I were to refuse the reward, I would not be able to focus with her giving a lecture dressed like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s see. I&#8217;ve done this once before, so you will get bored. I&#8217;ll think of a new situation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s not the issue, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I sigh inwardly in disgust, Takinami-senpai asks me while buttoning up her blouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Shizuru. Where was the ‘Name of the Rose?’”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can tell you, but I won’t come to pick you up even if you’re starving.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to what I had heard before, Takinami Ruika had maintained excellent grades through hard work and was therefore very good at teaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When that was over, it was just time to close the library, so Takinami-senpai also left. I closed the library as usual and returned the key to the staff room before leaving school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so it was when I came down to the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takinami-san, maybe you shouldn’t go to the library so often.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, why is that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice came unexpectedly, and I quickly hid myself behind the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who answered was, of course, Takinami-senpai. Even if her name had not been mentioned, I would have recognized her just by hearing her voice. But who was the other person? At least it was not Takajou-senpai&#8217;s calm, sweet voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because, you know, that rumor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rumor?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai asks back.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a topic we had discussed just a few minutes before. There was no way she could have not known. But I guess she dared to ask back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The librarian is stalking you, Takinami-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that thing. It’s alright. He’s not the type of person who would do such a thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She smoothly said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it&#8217;s also possible that he’ll misunderstand your intentions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right, that’s right.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It appears that there are several people advising Takinami-senpai. Her classmates, probably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard that after school, Takinami-senpai passes the time by chatting with her friends in the classroom and guiding them in their studies. I guess she came to the library after doing so today and rejoined the girls on her way home. I don&#8217;t know if it was by chance or by appointment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, I don’t think it’s Takinami-san’s image to bother with a guy like that…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-Is it…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai responded with a puzzled look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think they’re saying the most reasonable things. I’m sure that they’re one of those who hold the ideal image of Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It doesn’t suit her image, huh…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mumbled to myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I silently turned on my feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ll tell the teacher I forgot something in the library, borrow the key, spend a little time there, and then leave.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got home thirty minutes later than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, Hasumi-senpai didn’t get angry at such little difference, nor did she ask me why I was late. Rather, she said she was glad that the timing coincided with Uncle&#8217;s return so that they don’t need to eat separately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, after dinner, at night―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was in my room reviewing the lessons taught by Takinami-san, I heard a voice from outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened the door, Hasumi-senpai was standing there. She was wearing wide pants and a shirt, a very conservative fashion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I accidentally made two cups of coffee, so I’ll give you the other one.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, she had a cup of coffee in both hands. But what kind of accident is that? Was she playing or something?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was about to accept the cup, Hasumi-senpai quickly pulled it away. My hand shook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Did something happen?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at me with a straight face and asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like the other cup of coffee she accidentally made was for this. How perceptive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing really.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you telling the truth?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai asked again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered her again, clearly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothing in particular. My decision just happened naturally that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, good.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai finally handed me the cup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you have something on your mind, you can tell me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, Hasumi-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was about to go back to her room, but I stopped her. Hasumi-senpai turns around and looks at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?” She asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why did you tell Naoi that we’re siblings?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why, huh…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She mumbled as she thought about the meaning of the question in her head and brought her coffee cup to her mouth. She leaned against the hallway wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve known Naoi since junior high school and I know he admires me. I guess I wanted to tell him the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just about what I expected. She really cannot tell a lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai, you’re pretty sincere, did you know that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sincere? No way. It’s not that big of a deal.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai laughs, as if I said something outrageous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I really don’t want to tell a lie, you see. Once you lie, you either have to apologize afterwards or take it to your grave. Both are difficult for me to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I especially don&#8217;t want to lie about how I feel. It feels like I&#8217;m killing myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This thought Hasumi-senpai has must have been her true intention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why it’s even more heartbreaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should have been like this. I should not have lied to Naoi. I should have believed him, believed myself, who wanted Naoi Kyouhei to be the kind of person I wanted him to be, and told him the truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It feels like I’m killing myself, huh?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wish I had half as much sincerity as she did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In your eyes, Hasumi-senpai, I must look like I’m suffocating, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…”</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/bKRsWmK/00023.jpg" alt="00023" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai thought for a moment, and then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before, sure. Now, it has reduced.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder who was talking about somebody else’s b*****s, saying he wants to see me in my swimsuit. Is that what you call faithful, or rather, loyal to your desires? Haah, what a perverted little brother I have.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was at a loss for words at Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s taunting words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. I’ll get angry if you go too far, but so far you haven’t. Though, I’ll really get angry if you go too far…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said it twice, as it was important. And the second time, she looked at me with stern eyes. I&#8217;ll be careful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re saying whatever you want. Then, how about you saying something to Takinami-san too?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You like her, right? I don’t know what’s holding you back, but maybe you should say something to her and see how she reacts. Then, think about what you’ll do after seeing it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I could.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s right, the problem and solution were already there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But things were changing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Back to the topic―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I cut to the chase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it&#8217;s better if you don&#8217;t mention that we are siblings anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, I’m not planning on going around saying it to people. I would need to mention Dad if that happens after all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai chuckles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That said, I don’t think we need to have a lie ready in case that’s where the conversation is heading.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is she implicitly calling me out? Me, who tried to dodge the topic by saying we live nearby? No, that’s wrong. She doesn&#8217;t talk that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, Shizuru? Do you think it’s lame for me to be your older sister?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, that’s not what…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, it was the opposite. Takinami-senpai told me to have confidence in myself. However, only a few would think that not just anyone can do the job of a library committee. For many students who don&#8217;t think so, Makabe Shizuru is not cut out to be Hasumi Shion’s sibling. Nevertheless, if she reveals that I’m her younger brother, Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s image will worsen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, people were beginning to think that I’m a stalker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry if it looks like I’m making you lie, Hasumi-senpai. But please keep the fact that I’m your brother a secret as much as possible. Thank you very much for the coffee…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ah, wait, Shizuru!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I one-sidedly ended the conversation and closed the door without hearing Hasumi&#8217;s reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s it for Hasumi-senpai. Takinami-senpai has already been decided. ―Then, all that’s left is Naoi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, let’s apologize to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi has replaced his own jealousy with anger at being lied to by me. There is no doubt about that. But it’s also true that I lied to him. First of all, I will apologize for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had calculated that by doing so, I might be able to cut through his stubborn attitude, but more than that, I wanted to put my own mistakes to rest.</span></p>

<h2 style="text-align:center;">Act 2</h2>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I got on the train to go to school, I found Takinami Ruika there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s standing with one hand holding onto a strap above and her other hand holding a textbook. It must be a reference book since it’s a different size from school textbooks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looks like she’s completely focused on reading, so she hasn’t noticed me. Let’s just get away from here while she’s still not looking. Just when I was thinking that, she looked up as if something was calling to her. Naturally, she recognizes me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, good morning, Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I missed the timing to leave.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you were there, you should have called out to me.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t want to disturb you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geez, this is embarrassing…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai murmurs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We faced each other near the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you always enter through this door?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I try to ride any openings, so it&#8217;s not fixed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, some people keep things fixed, not only time for waking up and walking to the station, but even a specific door to go through. My classmate, Heshikiri Sakura, has the same idea. It seems like she’s anxious when doing anything different.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Since you told me before that this is your usual time. I tried to delay my departure a little… I guess it’s fate, huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you say it like that, a guy would misunderstand you. It’s just a coincidence.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although, in this case, she’s deliberately saying it like that, knowing I wouldn’t misunderstand her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, the train shook.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unless she was standing in a very unstable position, she would have been able to stand on her feet. Nevertheless, Takinami-senpai lost her balance and with a small scream, she fell onto my chest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I suddenly felt a very soft sensation. Not to put it strangely, but it’s as if Takinami Ruika was made of something soft. And her elegant scent tickled my nose, which I could smell due to the distance between us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Are you okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m sorry. What am I doing…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How blatant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Moreover, instead of moving away, she leaned even further.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takinami-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on. Last time, you were getting hugged by Takajou-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I whispered her name to warn her, she looked up and spoke in close range.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a small sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe-kun?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As expected, she couldn&#8217;t stay attached to me forever, so Takinami-senpai let go of my body. Then, perhaps sensing something suspicious about my behavior, she tilted her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I fell silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The train arrived at the Kobe Sports Park station and the doors behind opened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The number of passengers at this station is small. No one got on or off at this door either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An announcement is made that the door will soon be closed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, just before the doors closed―I got off the train.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shi…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai’s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked back and saw her face behind the closed door, her eyes were wide open. The train started to move, and soon I couldn&#8217;t see it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That should do it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I deliberately voice out my words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are many trains in the morning. The shortest interval is about three minutes and the longest is six minutes. As usual, I’m not running late, so if I catch the next train, I will be on time for school. I might be able to make up for the delay just by walking faster than usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The problem was Takinami-senpai waiting at the station.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naturally, the probability that she would want to hear the reason why I did such a thing is high. The thought of it made me dejected and hate myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, my phone got a notification. It was a message from a chat app.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I opened it up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『I’m sorry. I took my joke too far.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was reading and staring at that careful text, two more messages arrived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『I&#8217;ll go on ahead.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『I will apologize again this afternoon.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She felt bad about it. She must have thought that I got angry because of her joke. However, I was simply imposing my ideals onto her. And I will continue doing so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of the guilt I felt, I couldn’t reply.</span></p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After class, I looked around the classroom as I began putting away my stuff.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi&#8217;s group has already gathered. But they will now separate from there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, Naoi and his self-proclaimed partner, Murodo, are off to their club. The Handball club. There is another core member, Tatsuno, but he’s not a member of a club, so he will join up with a friend who was in the same class as him in the first year after this. And Izumikawa will be leaving school alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi&#8217;s group is united when the leader is present, but the ties of the others are thin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They exchanged some words and then dispersed. I followed Izumikawa out of the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Izumikawa.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I called out to him when he was alone, he jumped and turned around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wh-What is it? You want something from me…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why is he so nervous? Is it because his friends aren&#8217;t around, or is it because there’s something he knows? </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I need to ask you something.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;..”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Izumikawa was silent, perhaps wary of my appearance when I suddenly talked to him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was you who spread that rumor, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Huh?! W-What proof do you have to say that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Izumikawa probably knew that I was going to ask him about this topic. Even though he was prepared for it, he panicked because I hit the bull&#8217;s eye. In a sense, this reaction could be said to be proof.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At his voice, the gaze of other students suddenly gathered around him, he backed down with an annoyed look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Izumikawa, you’re mistaken.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mistaken?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right. I’m not a cop. Even if I don’t have any proof, I will still insinuate that it’s you. You’ve been spreading rumors with no proof, so we’re even, right? All I have to do is ask Naoi to do something about you, Izumikawa.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Stop it!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Izumikawa screams.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s no need to tell a teacher since we’re high schoolers. If that’s the case, the only thing left to do is to tell the leader of the group to which Izumikawa belongs, namely Naoi. He is a man of integrity, so he would not leave anything unjust and would confirm the facts with Izumikawa. And Izumikawa is more afraid of Naoi&#8217;s disapproval than receiving guidance from a teacher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-If it’s proof, I have it. I saw it. I saw you and Takinami-san at Harbor Land last Sunday.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like he didn’t start a rumor out of nothing. Izumikawa saw us. On Sunday, he saw me and Takinami-senpai meeting outside. Hasumi-senpai was there that day, but she had already left.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, that alone does not mean that I’m stalking Takinami-senpai, but Izumikawa dared to bend the facts there deliberately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s with you? You both get along with Hasumi-san and Takinami-san. I feel sorry for Kyouhei-kun. After all, Kyouhei-kun is…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps afraid to speak out, Izumikawa was vague about the last part.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So that’s how it is…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was mumbling to myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Izumikawa stuck to Naoi not because he just wanted to have a fun high school life. He also purely admired Naoi. That’s why he noticed his faint infatuation with Hasumi-senpai and sensed the recent change in him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Karube had deduced, Izumikawa was afraid that Naoi&#8217;s liking for me might cause a relative decline in his own reputation, and that he might be dropped from the group. But more than that, he was thinking about Naoi and trying to get rid of me. That’s why he spread bad rumors about me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I may have slightly misjudged Izumikawa Satoshi a little.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing really. I just thought that you really care for your friends.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Huh?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He cares for his friends. That’s why I have to say this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But Izumikawa, Naoi is a man of integrity. He won’t be pleased about what you did.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately after that, Izumikawa stopped dead in his tracks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stopped as well and faced him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Shut up. Besides, if only you weren’t around―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know. That’s why, leave the rest to me. I’ll take care of Naoi.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Like Izumikawa, I too want to do something about Naoi. The problem is that I have yet to come up with a concrete plan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found myself near the stairs. Izumikawa will go down from here to go home. I didn&#8217;t go downstairs, but went to the library.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Later, Izumikawa. See you tomorrow.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-Hey…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I tapped Izumikawa twice on the shoulder and left him.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the moment, only the members of his group are aware that something is wrong with Naoi. However, Naoi is in the limelight. If this continues, sooner or later, it is bound to spread throughout the class.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would like to do something before that happens.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the library, after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami Ruika showed up a little earlier than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good afternoon, Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Good afternoon.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We greeted each other as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, our conversation didn’t continue from there. Takinami-senpai was standing in front of the counter, looking like she wanted to say something, but couldn&#8217;t seem to proceed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Um, about this morning―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, she made up her mind and opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I took it too far. I’m sorry I got carried away. I got on that train since I thought I would be able to meet you, Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She sincerely apologizes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I’m sorry too. I acted on impulse. I’m very sorry.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No. Besides, it’s not your fault that Takajou-san hugged you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, that person likes to fool around.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But I don’t think it’s right for someone like you to get carried away when meeting me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I suppose.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai then moved her face a little closer. She continued whispering as if she was telling a secret.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll be careful when people are around.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do it even if no one is watching. It&#8217;s surprising how much people notice when you&#8217;re slacking off while no one is looking. My late mother used to say that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I responded to her mischievous reply. I tried to keep my tone as light as possible so as not to make the atmosphere heavy since I was bringing up my mother who passed away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I think it’s a nice saying.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai went back to her original position. She had a faintly dubious expression on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Speaking of which, we&#8217;re going to the movies tomorrow.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then she changed the subject.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come to think of it, there was something like that. We’re only going to watch one movie so it’s a relief.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We’ll be dismissed before lunchtime So if you’d like, Makabe-kun, we can have lunch together.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for the invitation, but I’ll refrain. I don&#8217;t want to make enemies with every guy in the school.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I softly declined.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This isn’t me playing hard to get, I’m more or less serious. As Takinami-senpai had said, tomorrow we will watch one movie and seperate by noon. Many students will probably have lunch and play with their good friends. I don&#8217;t know where the students of Akanedai High School would be, or rather, they would be everywhere. It would be too scary to have lunch with Takinami Ruika in such a situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alright. But there’s still time, let me know if you change your mind.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai gave a gentle, mature smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Soon after, the bell rings. The remaining students began to put away their belongings with a look that said, &#8220;Is it that time already?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, right after all the students except Kanata-senpai left the room,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Say, Shizuru? If Sannomiya is not good, I know a place not too far, how about it?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As usual, she changed her tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No matter how many times you ask, my answer will be the same. Look, Takinami-senpai, please go home. I’m going to close the library soon.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Wait, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She didn’t hesitate to call me out again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’ve been wondering for a while. What’s with that way of speaking?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She asked me with a stern look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What do you mean, isn’t this how you treat someone older than you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes, that’s right. That’s the correct way. But you should treat me differently. You should be blunt and curt, just as you always have, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Judging from an outside perspective, that sounds like a bad junior.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m trying to change that attitude.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stop. Don’t give me that conventional smile. Don’t talk to me like a polite underclassman.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai and I faced each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She glared at me and I met her gaze.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Say, Shizuru? What are you angry about? I already apologized about what happened this morning, didn’t I? Or are you still mad at me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m not angry.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was never angry in the first place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Takinami-senpai, it’s almost time to close the room. Please get ready to leave the room.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I quietly told her as a member of the library committee, she lightly choked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai glared at me once again, picked up her school bag from beside her feet, and left the library. Her back figure looks very firm and resolute.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It makes my heart ache a little.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s probably the same guilt as this morning. It&#8217;s all right. It will eventually numb me out. Or maybe Takinami-senpai will give up on me first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That was an interesting scene.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I stared at the doorway where Takinami-senpai had disappeared, I heard a voice behind me. I turned around and saw Kanata-senpai standing with her back resting on the table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I don&#8217;t think Takinami would give up with just that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanata-senpai is probably right. But she needs to, otherwise, it’ll be a problem.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So you’re not going to ask why.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know what’s on your mind.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She easily told me that. Well, I think I’m being hasty if I say so myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Are you okay with that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Kanata-senpai continues to ask.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s not about me being a good or bad choice. This is the best option. We need to treat all factors equally otherwise we won’t get the right answer.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Really? If you ask me, you seem to be turning away from the most important factor. Isn’t that exactly why you should treat all factors equally?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What&#8217;s that important factor?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m surprised. Are you that stupid to ask me that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I involuntarily fell silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Besides, you&#8217;ve got it all wrong.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Oddly enough, those were the exact words I had said to Izumikawa during lunch break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why should you give the right answer?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A dumb sound escaped from my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It doesn&#8217;t matter if it&#8217;s right or wrong. Think about what you want to do and come up with an answer that works for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked closely and saw that Kanata-senpai had already finished preparing to leave.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/vz87P2Q/00024.jpg" alt="00024" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“The right answer is easier to find than you think. It&#8217;s just that sometimes you know in your head that it&#8217;s right, but you can&#8217;t do it, and a series of right answers is not always the right path.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After saying this, Kanata-senpai left the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What a way to imply things…”</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Act 3</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The next day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Movie viewing day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we were not in elementary school, the meeting place is the movie theater in Sannomiya at 9:00 am.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The Hasumi residence is relatively close to the school, but far from Sannomiya. Even so, the meeting time was later than the start of a regular class at school, so I was able to take my time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A little before 8:00 am, I got ready to leave and went down from my room to the living room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And even faster than me was Hasumi-senpai. She was reading a book as usual. It might be too late to say this, but she may be an avid reader. Next time I have a chance, I will recommend a book by Soichiro to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re quite early.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I didn’t need to cook lunch today after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hasumi-senpai replies as she closes the book.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? But what about Uncle…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He didn&#8217;t have any duty last night, so Hasumi-son went home at a normal time. This morning, we ate breakfast together again and he left a little earlier. We don&#8217;t need a lunch box, but I&#8217;m sure Uncle needs one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He said that he didn’t want me to cook just for his portion so he refrained. It looks like he would eat at the hospital cafeteria. It doesn&#8217;t make much difference whether I make one or three lunches though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hasumi-senpai chuckles as she says this, but there’s no sound of mockery in her tone. She must have been glad as he was expressing concern for her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Certainly one and three would not make much difference, but the difference between zero and one is huge. As the numbers indicate, it’s the difference between doing it and not doing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I looked at Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s attire again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Today, she seems to be wearing a hoodie and long denim pants. I patted my chest in relief.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s with that reaction?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And Hasumi-senpai asked. How perceptive… I didn’t intend to show it on my face though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-No, nothing…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Whenever you say that, it’s definitely not anything good… Say it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why would you ask it if you know that it’s nothing good?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t complain.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I chose my words carefully before opening my mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, thank goodness, she’s not wearing something guys would enjoy, was what I thought.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s with that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The result became a strange statement, and Hasumi-senpai asks back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hasumi-senpai has a good style, so if you were to wear clothes that show off your curves too much, guys would really enjoy it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, so that’s how it is. But saying that, aren’t you also one of those guys who would enjoy it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I won’t deny it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I just don&#8217;t like it when the other guys are happy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You&#8217;re really honest in the weirdest ways.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hasumi-senpai cracked a laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ve always believed that it&#8217;s bad to live in a society where honesty is not rewarded.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then, for some reason, she starts talking like a sociologist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I agree with that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It should not be the case that those who live honestly would suffer losses and those who do not would gain.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Honest people deserve a reward. I&#8217;m wearing a rather tight tank top under here, wanna see…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly, Hasumi-senpai utters such a thing while fidgeting with the collar of her hoodie.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The way she said it was somewhat provocative.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Can I?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I respond to her provocation, looking her straight in the eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hasumi-senpai and I glare at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Sorry. Can’t.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry. I will refrain after all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We uttered at the same time, as if we had surrendered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I usually wear it as loungewear, so it should be fine, but showing it myself is a bit different.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m also not thick-skinned enough to look at it boldly.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It appears that this match is a draw.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m starting to become like Takinami-san, but I’m surprised she could do something like this.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hasumi-senpai said in dismay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come on, stop fooling around and get going.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How could you talk about others when you’re also in?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was about to turn on my feet as Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s words drove me away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, that’s right, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hasumi-senpai stops me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Why don’t you go on a date with Takinami-san on the way home?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I’d rather not.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“O-Okay…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hasumi-senpai blinked her eyes at my words, which came out without hesitation.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I went to the movie theater in Sannomiya, much less the lobby, even the front of the theater was filled with students from Akanedai High School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s natural. The whole student body is here after all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There was no way that this many students could watch the film in the same place, and from here we were split up into several screens. I moved to the floor with the screen assigned to my class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">There I found Karube Kagemitsu and Heshikiri Sakura and joined them.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, today&#8217;s film is not a trendy one as it’s something to watch as a part of a school class.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dreams_of_Russia" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><i><span style="font-weight: 400;">Dreams of Russia</span></i></a></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shipwrecked off the coast of Siberia, the Japanese captain sixteen sailors went on a wonderful adventure full of emotions, love, despair, and wonder for nine long years. The film seems to have been produced more than a quarter of a century ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ve already read the novel, so I don&#8217;t think it would be interesting to see the movie. I heard that some episodes that existed in the source material were cut out.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Heshikiri-san giggles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, so it’s an adaptation.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, it’s based on a book written by Inoue Yasushi. I think there’s a book in our school library.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Now that’s nice. Worst case scenario, I could read the novel and write my thoughts with it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, it’s not going to end with just watching the film. You will be asked to write your impressions.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m sure it would take longer to grasp the content of a novel than a movie, so why bother choosing the more tedious option?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“True.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So, worst case scenario. Unless I fall asleep so much that I lose track of the contents, I would be able to supplement it with a novel.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">『Students should go to their respective homeroom teachers and say their names before going in.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Suddenly I heard a teacher&#8217;s voice through the loudspeaker. The same announcement would probably be made outside and inside the lobby.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I look around. And there, Asaba-sensei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll take a look.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I spoke to Karube and Heshikiri-san, and I swam out through the sea of people toward Asaba-sensei.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Asaba-sensei, Makabe is here. Karube and Heshikiri-san are here, too.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Makabe? I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;ve been told that I need to see your faces to confirm your attendance. Could you tell Karube and Heshikiri to come over here as well?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Asaba-sensei replied with an annoyed look on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I understand.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In short, it’s probably to avoid a situation where friends are asked to declare their attendance when in fact they’re not present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">So the movie began at 10:00 ― and ended uneventfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The students were released shortly after noon.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Although the entire school body was divided into about five screens to watch the film, the beginning and the end were the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After the movie, the lobby was filled with students just like this morning. Everyone seemed to be talking about what they were going to do afterward. Occasionally I overheard conversations about the contents of the movie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, what should I do?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have not discussed this with Hasumi-senpai, but she probably would eat lunch with her friends. I’m sure she would not mind if I went back to the Hasumi residence and ate whatever was in the kitchen, but I still think it would be safer to go home after eating something with Karube and Heshikiri-san.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was pondering, my name was called.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I looked in the direction of the voice, I saw Takinami-senpai there. Takajou-senpai and others were also with her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai wore long pants and an oversized blouse. The other seniors were also dressed in their own beautiful clothes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello there, Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami Ruika greeted me with a tender smile as if yesterday&#8217;s exchange was a lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hello. So you were also on this floor, Takinami-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yes.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was the same for me, and I treated her as a kind librarian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“We were just going to have lunch. If you don’t mind, would you like to join?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This is her testing me―is what I thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It&#8217;s like an ultimatum.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether I accept or decline this invitation will be decisive for our relationship in the future.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you for the offer, but I’ll decline. I’m not a good company for you seniors. I just wish Naoi was here.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">But my answer remains the same.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai let out a sigh of resignation.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“See, I told you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A person in the group around her tugged at her sleeve. She said it in a low voice, but I could hear her clearly. I think this voice is one of the ones I heard at the entrance to the school the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“And with that rumor, if you were going to talk, I think it’s best to keep it in the library.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai tilted her head as she looked at the person who tugged her sleeve, and then looked at me as if she suddenly realized something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You, is this your intention…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Well, I guess she would know it sooner or later.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Come on, let’s look for Naoi-kun and the others.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai then moved away from me as her friend pulled her by the arm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My heart ached again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was about to board the elevator to go down to the ground floor, I found Naoi Kyouhei and his cronies, including Izumikawa, in the elevator. Takinami&#8217;s group did not seem to be able to find them in the crowd.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We rode the elevator together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In this case, people would naturally be silent, but since we were riding together with good friends and we were surrounded by students from the same school, everyone was talking loudly. Amidst this, only Naoi and I stood shoulder to shoulder and kept silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yo.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I didn&#8217;t expect him to say anything, I felt more conscious than necessary―the words we exchanged were very brief and meaningless.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The elevator arrives at ground level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The lobby is also still full of students meeting their friends or chatting without going outside yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I think I need to talk to Naoi. However, he had no classes and was released at the Sannomiya terminal station at an earlier time than usual. If I bring up a heavy subject, it might damper the conversation. Also, I&#8217;m not sure if this is the time to talk about such things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Nao―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, it’s the librarian!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The voice that jumped out belonged to Shiiba Akane-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then… sure enough, there she was, along with the member of her group, Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Makabe-kun… Oh, Naoi-kun is here too. I was wondering if you would like to have lunch together?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Eh? Really?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m coming, I’m coming!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The first to react to Hasumi&#8217;s invitation were Naoi&#8217;s two cronies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And as for Naoi and I, we were both puzzled and very conscious of each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Frankly, I would like to avoid sitting around the same table with Naoi now if possible. I’m sure he feels the same way. No, maybe even more than me. But Naoi cannot refuse. As he is not alone at the moment. As a leader, he would not be willing to involve his friends in his own problems.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since Naoi cannot take that option, I have no choice but to decline.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Listen, listen, Librarian-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just then, Shiiba-senpai spoke to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I know a great place. Since I knew we were going to be dismissed at this kind of time, I&#8217;ve reserved a table for about ten people, with the possibility of increasing or decreasing the number of people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re surprisingly flexible.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ve always had a noisy and rash image of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Right? Akane is surprisingly kept together at times.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hasumi-senpai spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Fufun. We are four sisters, which is rare nowadays, and I am the eldest.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, so that’s how.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Surprising. She had the look that If she came running at me with her arms outstretched, I would catch her and hold her in my arms.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That said, she’s still a bit of a trouble to handle.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stop saying that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Shiiba-senpai glares at me with half-lidded eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That&#8217;s why it only happens sometimes.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Said Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I mean, for the time I spent at home being a reliable sister, I want my friends to spoil me at school… Well, let’s leave it at that. Alright, let&#8217;s go to the restaurant, okay?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">C**p. I missed the time to decline. So I guess this is why she can be reliable at times? No matter. Let’s look for a chance to talk with Naoi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We walk along the sidewalk with the large street and the Sannomiya Center Plaza building visible.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Karube and Heshikiri-san, who had been with us earlier, were no longer present. Naturally, Hasumi-senpai and Shiiba-senpai showed their usual friendliness and invited them to join, but the two declined. I think they would be worn out when working with this group because of their personalities.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The group naturally formed with Hasumi-senpai and Naoi in the center of the lead, and I was unable to find the right moment to call out to Naoi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Akane is good at bringing in men, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Stop it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">As we moved to the restaurant that Shiiba-senpai had reserved for us, the chatter was lively with her as the topic of conversation. Even though it was lunchtime, we were able to have lunch without having to wait, thanks to Shiiba-senpai. Pity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess I do look like a mascot because of what I do. Then if I said that we should start at being friends first, they will see that it wasn’t as they imagined it to be.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Oh, that’s the guy’s fault.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Naoi who answered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Even if you have preconceived notions, that&#8217;s the way Shiiba-senpai really is, and you have to accept that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was a very honor student-like opinion. Shiiba nodded his head in delight and said, &#8220;Naoi-kun, those are some good words!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The other seniors and Naoi&#8217;s cronies laughed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A friendly atmosphere.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I followed them hoping to talk to Naoi somewhere―but somehow I felt out of place. I should have left and gone with Karube and Heshikiri-san.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">After having lunch at an Indian restaurant reserved by Shiiba-senpai, we walked around the Sannomiya area and disbanded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Since we siblings and Naoi share the same nearest station, we were together until the very end. Most of today&#8217;s members went off one by one, and when the last one got off, it was just me, Hasumi-senpai, and Naoi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We got off the train at Myodani and exited through the ticket gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">This would be a good time to talk to Naoi. If I say that I have something to talk to him about, Hasumi-senpai will probably go home first, and although it&#8217;s a bit unfair, Naoi won&#8217;t be able to shove me away in that situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I was thinking so, Hasumi-senpai, who was walking in the lead, turned around and suddenly opened her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So, are you guys fighting or something? You don&#8217;t talk at all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi and I involuntarily look at each other… But, we quickly looked away.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“N-No…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s not really…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I can’t tell the truth even to Hasumi-senpai. Rather, it’s because it’s Hasumi-senpai that I’m unable to say anything, so I fell silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, you’re both guys. I guess there’s a lot going on.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hasumi-senpai saw this and gave a small wry smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You know, Naoi-kun. Shizuru may not look like it, but he’s surprisingly a good guy. His hand was on cast just a while ago, right? Did you know why?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hasumi-senpai!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s fine, right? It’s quite heroic after all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I tried to stop her, but she didn&#8217;t care at all. She even sent me a mischievous wink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I haven’t heard.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Said Naoi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That injury is from the time Shizuru was stabbed while defending me when a guy pulled a knife on me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Huh?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was indeed a shock to the ears. Or, perhaps, it’s more accurate to say that he was taken aback by the sheer bravery of the action.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, that’s the gist of it. But don’t you think he has guts? I may be overreacting, but he saved my life. So, Naoi-kun, please be good friends with Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Furthermore, Hasumi-senpai now turned to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Shizuru, too. Naoi-kun is my cute junior, so you should get along with him.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She said that as if she was telling a child.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I could not be the only one to say &#8220;yes&#8221; as long as Naoi had not responded. If I answered &#8220;yes,&#8221; it might force Naoi, who had not yet sorted out his feelings, to answer, or it might turn him into a sulking child alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hasumi-senpai looked at us and sighed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I guess it&#8217;s not that easy. Well, fine. That&#8217;s all I can say… Naoi-kun, see you later.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Ah, okay.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi responded apologetically.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Hasumi-senpai turned on her feet and started walking, and I followed her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi kept looking at me as if he wanted to say something, but in the end, he never said anything until the end.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center;">Act 4(1)</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">And then the week ended.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The school event of watching a movie ended. And Monday came the same as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I had decided that today was the day I would talk to Naoi. I couldn&#8217;t put it off any longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At lunchtime, after the fourth-period class, I put my textbooks and notebooks away in my bag and took out my lunch box. While I was doing so, I made up my mind―I was ready to go to Naoi, and when I turned around, he was right in front of me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“ “Ah…” “</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Both of us voiced a small sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The slightly awkward atmosphere fell.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Makabe.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, looking determined, Naoi opened his mouth first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What? I have a lunch box today.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, that’s not it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, I knew that’s not what he had in mind.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, as if he had noticed something, his well-shaped eyebrows twitched.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That lunchbox, um…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi&#8217;s eyes were on the lunch box I took out of my bag.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, my older sister made it for me, not some relative auntie.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You should piss off for once.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi awkwardly laughs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking at him, I thought that Naoi was somewhat over the situation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m jealous.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He uttered this and then nodded once, as if he was convinced of something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s right. I was jealous of you. So I took it out to you. Uh… you’d understand why, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi asks me, seemingly reluctant to utter it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;m not that slow either.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thanks. That’s why… I’m sorry.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi bowed lightly. I also didn’t expect him to bow deeply, so this is enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Even he knew that what he was doing was taking out his anger onto me. In fact, it must have been painful for him because he had the perspective to understand it that way. Human beings have many impulses that they cannot control.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, it’s my turn next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m sorry, too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I bow to him, just as Naoi did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s this, all of the sudden? There’s nothing for you to apologize about.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi widened his eyes at this sudden action of mine.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“No, I shouldn&#8217;t have lied to you, Naoi. I was wrong at the first step.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s normal to hide the mess in your house.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi smiled briskly, but I shook my head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re pretty generous. If I had explained it properly, you might have accepted it. But I escaped using a lie.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You’re overestimating me. Look what happened”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi chuckles to himself, perhaps in reflection of his own conduct.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But then again, it&#8217;s even harder to win when you think of me that way.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Harder to win?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">When I asked back, Naoi nodded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“After listening to Hasumi-senpai, I knew I couldn&#8217;t beat you, Makabe. I wondered if I could do the same thing, but the answer never came. You’re strong. To be able to do that to protect someone.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi&#8217;s face was fresh as he said this. I see. So that&#8217;s the reason why he became like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You don&#8217;t know if you can do it or not until you stand there. I think you can also do it to protect someone. No, you would do it better than I would.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I wonder.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi gave a vague answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But then again, the two of us look pathetic.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Un?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“In the end, Hasumi-senpai had to set us up for us to get this far.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s true.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was as if Hasumi-senpai had told us both not to fight. In addition, I realized my mistake from her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Hasumi-senpai told me that she doesn’t want to lie to you since you two are great friends. At the very least, you’re in that place. From there, it’s up to you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Thank you. I’ll try my best. Then… how are things on your side going?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Me? What about me?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Don’t fool around. Of course it’s about Takinami-senpai. You were eating together in the cafeteria the other day. She doesn&#8217;t do that with other guys. Don’t say that she’s just your senior.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He pokes me in the chest with his fist.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Takinami-senpai and I are not a match for each other.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Not that again.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi scratches his head in dismay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Say, Makabe. All of that talk that you two are not a match, don’t you think that’s just noise? Because in the end, it wouldn’t matter. If that’s the case, why don’t you just ignore that from the very beginning? Then, the rest is up to you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest is up to me―that&#8217;s what I said to Naoi just a few moments ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">He has a serious look on his face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Be true to your feelings―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I thought I was not going to be able to fool those words, so I uttered it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“What’s that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Words from someone I respect and admire.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“That’s nice. And the answer is already there.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Maybe.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right. The answer is already here.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">My new answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The rest is up to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Kyouhei-kun, let’s get going.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What I heard there was Izumikawa&#8217;s voice. It was obvious that he was tense. He was waiting for Naoi at the entrance of the classroom with Murodo and Tateno.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“He sounds angry? Maybe hunger is getting to him.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You know what you’re talking about.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi looked surprised.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I&#8217;ll tell Izumikawa myself.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Do it in moderation. I don’t hate him that much.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I really don’t think I can beat you, Makabe… Alright, then.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then Naoi leaves. They would probably be in the school cafeteria with the usual members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Alright一”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I deliberately let out a sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I&#8217;ll have lunch too. As usual, I took my lunch to Karube and Heshikiri-san&#8217;s place.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">On a whim, I looked out the window and saw a rainy sky that had yet to end even though we’re in July. Since I had made peace with Naoi, it would have been nice to have a clear blue sky. The sky really can’t take a hint.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At the library after school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The unsettling clouds covering the sky brought a steady rainfall in the afternoon. With the current climate, which can turn into a downpour or a thunderstorm at any time, some of the few regular students seemed to have gone straight home after class. Of course, since we don&#8217;t know when it will happen, God only knows whether it will be good or bad for us to leave school early. One thing I do know is that there are fewer visitors than usual today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As I sat at the library counter, I wondered if Takinami-senpai would come today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She might not come. No, she probably won’t. I rejected her invitation after all. There is no reason for her to come here anymore.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I should have gone to get her myself, I thought bitterly, feeling responsible for my own actions. Since there were few people anyway, there would have been no problem even if I had not opened the library at least today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Time is passing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It is still raining hard outside. Takinami-senpai must have gone home early. Hopefully, she returned home before it got stronger.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Then, about 30 minutes before closing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">At this hour of the day, someone arrived. It was probably not a student. It was probably a teacher who came to do some research. I thought so, and when I looked up at the presence, I saw that it was Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">We looked at each other silently.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was taken aback, not expecting Takinami-senpai to show up, but I wondered what she was thinking in her silence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It was Takinami-senpai who looked away first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She walked past the counter and sat down at one of the reading tables. It was as if she was ignoring my presence.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She took out her textbooks, notebooks, and pens from her school bag on the chair next to her. She seems to be studying. It’s probably because tests are coming up soon.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I put a note on the counter that said, &#8220;Currently away. I&#8217;ll be right back.&#8221; I went towards Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Can we talk for a minute?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I called out to her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">However, she’s flipping through her book, not caring about me standing right next to her. Is she trying to ignore me?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Eventually, Takinami-senpai found the page she wanted and placed the book down, leaving it open.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m going to solve a couple of problems and then go home. Will it be quick?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She looks up and asks while looking at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I’m afraid not.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Is that so? Well, I’ll listen. Let’s go outside.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai stood up. She then headed straight for the library entrance. I followed her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The location is the hallway just outside the library. If the entrance door is left open, the counter can be seen from here, and it’s easy to see if someone comes in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">In the hallway in front of the library, I faced Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naturally, there was no smile on her face. She was not angry, on the contrary, she seemed to be waiting to see what I would say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Now, what should I say? I&#8217;m going to say something really pathetic. I hope I can at least land it right the first time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai let out a sigh, probably because I didn&#8217;t say anything even though I brought her out here to talk.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she began to speak, her expression and tone were detached.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought the reason you suddenly became so distant was because of my joke on the train. But it’s about that rumor, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Well, I guess so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I responded.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">As she said, that&#8217;s probably one of the reasons. Not the main factor, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It&#8217;s just a stupid rumor. It&#8217;s not true. You yourself know that better than anyone else.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It doesn’t matter if they’re true or not when it comes to rumors. As long as it&#8217;s entertaining, that’s the essence of rumors. The truth and validity are just secondary.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">What supports the rumor system is the relationship between two parties: those who want to attract attention by telling an interesting story even if it’s exaggerated, and those who want to hear an interesting story even if it’s not true.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“On that note, the story is definitely more interesting when I&#8217;m a stalker.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“It’s a mess.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai snickered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, it’s messed up and irresponsible. But even you had your fair share of rumors, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;Right.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">She seemed to have an idea of what I was talking about and affirmed it in short words.</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course, I have one too. Over lunch with Karube and Heshikiri-san, we talked about the rumors we overheard. I recall two or three of them, and I&#8217;m sure there are others I can&#8217;t recall. I don&#8217;t even remember if those rumors are true or not. There’s a limit to being irresponsible. But rumors are a great way to fill in the gaps in a conversation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“So you’re going to distance yourself from me?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I thought I’m not a good actor. It would reflect negatively on your name.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whether me being the stalker is true or not, many students would not be happy to see Takinami-senpai happily talking or eating with me in the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami Ruika is beautiful, intelligent, and ladylike. She’s equally kind to everyone, but from an underclassman&#8217;s point of view, she’s a little difficult to talk to. They want her to be that way, and she should be. An ordinary boy like me should not be treated specially by her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s what I,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“But it was a mistake.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">That’s right. Another mistake.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Just as I should not have lied to Naoi Kyouhei, I should not have lied again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I have an affection for Takinami Ruika. There’s no doubt about that. If that’s the case, isn’t it fine? Certainly, there’s the question of whether these feelings are genuine or not. However, if I put my own feelings aside just because I was thinking too much, I would be lying to myself. And by distancing myself from Takinami-senpai, by extension, I would lying to her as well.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Whenever I pushed Takinami-senpai away on several occasions, I always felt guilty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I understand now. That pain in my chest was what Hasumi-senpai was talking about, the pain of lying to myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Was it a mistake?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai asks back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Yeah, it was. Certainly, I wanted you to be the one from my ideal. But I, myself, should not have pushed that ideal onto you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I would have said it myself sometime. I was glad to know her true face. Why didn&#8217;t I follow through on that feeling?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Naoi Kyouhei had also said. What people around you say is just noise. No, on the contrary, even your own thoughts can be noise. Cut through the noise and decide for yourself in the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“I apologize for my attitude the last few days. So―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“How selfish.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai did not let me finish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">A single phrase is all it takes to kick me down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“You tried to distance yourself one-sidedly and realized that it was a mistake, now you want to start over? How self-centered, don’t you think so?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“&#8230;I do.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400;"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Of course I think so. No man could be more selfish.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">“Then you know the answer, don&#8217;t you? Don&#8217;t upset my feelings any more. Don&#8217;t upset me any more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Takinami-senpai coldly said, then turned on her feet and walked back inside the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">I was left alone in the hallway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">No wonder she was angry. It was too selfish of me to ask her to pretend it had never happened because I apologized. Takinami-senpai must have made her mind long ago, and she came here today to tell me that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400;">It looks like I was too late.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◆◆◆</p>

<p>Even though Takinami-senpai was inside, it would be foolish to return to the same place. I felt like just going home, but I had a role as a library committee member and a responsibility. I had to fulfill my daily tasks.</p>

<p>I returned to the library and took a seat at the counter. And just then, as if waiting for that moment, Kanata-senpai arrived.</p>

<p>&quot;Shizuru, the magazine I'm looking for is not here.&quot;</p>

<p>She brought up the matter suddenly. I didn't have time to think about unnecessary things, so I was somewhat relieved.</p>

<p>&quot;Just to be sure, let me search here as well. What magazine is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's 'Sad&#333;' (&#33590;&#36947;, tea ceremony).&quot;</p>

<p>I typed as instructed and performed the search. If I narrowed down the results to magazines, there was only one that included that string of characters. It must be this one.</p>

<p>I displayed the bibliographic information and checked the details. Even though they had stopped accepting new issues before I entered the school, they still had the back issues. The placement should be on the magazine's back issue shelf, and there were no changes to the magazine title. Confirming each detail one by one, I finally understood after double-checking the title.</p>

<p>&quot;Kanata-senpai, where did you look?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the back issue shelf, under the 'Sa' section.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you look closely, the title is pronounced as 'Chad&#333;' (&#12385;&#12419;&#12393;&#12358;). I think you'll find it if you search under the 'Ta' section.&quot;</p>

<p>I had a feeling I had heard about it on TV. The head of the tea ceremony pronounced it as 'Chad&#333;.' It seemed that this specialized magazine for tea ceremony was also pronounced as 'Chad&#333;.'</p>

<p>&quot;I'll give it a try.&quot;</p>

<p>Without even saying thanks, she headed towards the bookshelf where the back issues were stored. It was unusual for Kanata-senpai, who specialized in history, to overlook something like this. Perhaps when I mentioned it, she suddenly remembered.</p>

<p>Before long, Kanata-senpai returned. In her hand was a single magazine. She came all the way to show it to me.</p>

<p>&quot;I found it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's great.&quot;</p>

<p>Feeling a small joy in having been helpful, I nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;It seems Takinami is not here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Prompted by Kanata-senpai's words, I looked towards the reading area, and indeed, Takinami-senpai was not there. The texts were left as they were, so maybe he was searching for a book that could be helpful somewhere, or perhaps he had stepped out of the library for some reason.</p>

<p>&quot;You went out with Takinami earlier. What did you talk about?&quot;</p>

<p>Looking intently at the empty seat, Kanata-senpai asked me.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing much. It wasn't an important conversation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can guess the general idea.&quot;</p>

<p>Probably. If so, why did she ask?</p>

<p>&quot;'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.'&quot;</p>

<p>Kanata-senpai suddenly uttered those words.</p>

<p>&quot;Wasn't that Einstein?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;People tend to think so, but it has been spreading that he didn't actually say it.&quot;</p>

<p>So it seems it wasn't Einstein.</p>

<p>&quot;And what's the meaning behind it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you repeat useless things countless times, it remains useless. It's better to realize it sooner.&quot;</p>

<p>Kanata-senpai said it as if praising me.</p>

<p>&quot;In my interpretation, it means if you can't achieve the desired results by repeating an experiment, it's due to the lack of reproducibility. It suggests considering a different approach. However, that's assuming it's the quote from physicist Einstein.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In physics, there is only one conclusion that can be derived from a single event. No matter how many times you repeat an experiment with incorrect assumptions, you cannot obtain the desired result.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know who said those words, but they sound like a denial of the idea of continuing to challenge without giving up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then?&quot;</p>

<p>Souta-senpai asks.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you want, from me?&quot;</p>

<p>It was clear from the beginning, without even asking such a question.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Souta-senpai. Can you watch the counter for me? I'll step away for a bit.&quot;</p>

<p>Saying that, I leave the counter.</p>

<p>I never had any intention of giving up. If that's the case, it's better to act quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;You've got quite the courage.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't feel comfortable leaving it unattended multiple times. Just sitting here is enough. Besides, no one will come anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>To begin with, there are few users today. And if they realize that Souta-senpai is at the counter, they will surely turn back.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, please take responsibility for instigating this.&quot;</p>

<p>I leave the counter to Souta-senpai and head towards the back of the bookshelf.</p>

<p>I enter the second-to-last row from the very back. It's the section for English literature, and there's even the original version of 'Harry Potter'.</p>

<p>There, I open my mouth calmly.</p>

<p>&quot;There's something I want to ask you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh!?&quot;</p>

<p>There is a faint sign of someone holding their breath from the backmost row behind the bookshelf.</p>

<p>That's right. Takanami Reika is on the other side.</p>

<p>She said before that the farthest back of the bookshelf is the best place for thinking and being alone. That's why she came here.</p>

<p>&quot;There is something fatally missing in me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Missing?&quot;</p>

<p>I hear Takanami-senpai's voice.</p>

<p>We continue the conversation without seeing each other.</p>

<p>&quot;I know how to behave and what expression to show depending on the situation at that time. But because I'm too good at it, I can't help but doubt if my own feelings are artificial.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the first time I'm telling Takanami-senpai about this.</p>

<p>&quot;In other words, I can't have confidence in my own feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it like what Shizuru often said, that you're not suited for love?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. Don't you find it funny? Even though I can objectively see the situation, including myself, I have no idea about my own feelings at the center.&quot;</p>

<p>I unintentionally self-deride.</p>

<p>&quot;I like Takanami-senpai. There are times when I doubt if my feelings are genuine. But no matter how much I think about it, those feelings are certainly within me, and they haven't disappeared. With these feelings, I want to face Takanami-senpai.&quot;</p>

<p>This is my utmost sincerity at the moment.</p>

<p>However, it may not be convincing to Takanami-senpai. After all, it's like saying, &quot;I like you,&quot; without knowing for sure if I truly feel that way. There couldn't be a more insincere statement. Moreover, just a little over ten minutes ago, she rejected me. Will it be so easily overturned?</p>

<p>But her response was not an answer.</p>

<p>&quot;I also have it to some extent.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai speaks quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;I told you, right? That there are times when I feel like I might be 'empty.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>She keenly senses what others expect from her and has become the present &quot;Takanami Reika&quot; by meeting those expectations. However, because of that, she feels lacking in agency and &quot;empty.&quot;</p>

<p>On the day we first met, Takanami-senpai posed a question to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you have a proper sense of 'self'?&quot;</p>

<p>And...</p>

<p>We are similar.</p>

<p>We observe ourselves and our surroundings from a bird's-eye view, and based on that, determine the right way to act. Takanami-senpai takes a long-term perspective, while I take a short-term one. That's the only difference.</p>

<p>That's why Takanami-senpai calls me a &quot;kindred spirit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I have Shizuru. With Shizuru, who has the same eyes and sees the same things, I don't have to meet the expectations of those around me. I don't feel 'empty.' I can believe that I have a proper 'self.'&quot;</p>

<p>That's right. That's why Takanami-senpai is her true self in front of me. While I wonder if it's okay for me, at the same time, I feel a slight sense of superiority about it.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Shizuru?&quot;</p>

<p>The voice calling my name didn't come from behind the bookshelf but from the side. I turn towards that direction.</p>

<p>And there stood Takanami Reika.</p>

<p>&quot;Just as I have Shizuru, don't you think Shizuru has me? That's what I believe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...&quot;</p>

<p>The words don't smoothly register in my mind, and I ask in return.</p>

<p>&quot;Because when we're alone together, Shizuru, you don't use honorifics and you're not friendly, right? But I think that's the real Shizuru, and there are no lies there.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, I adopt such an attitude only in front of her.</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai saw through that I adapt my expressions and choose my words according to the situation. I thought that if I continued doing such things in front of her, who had seen through it, it would expose my vulnerable self.</p>

<p>&quot;...Maybe.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai and I are similar. To borrow her words, we are &quot;kindred spirits.&quot; If that's the case, just as Takanami-senpai's &quot;self&quot; is by my side, perhaps my &quot;self&quot; that doesn't doubt my own emotions is also by Takanami-senpai's side.</p>

<p>&quot;That's why, I think you should find out for yourself. Just keep being together as usual.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai suggests with a somewhat hesitant tone.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, maybe that's for the best.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;R-Really...?&quot;</p>

<p>For some reason, her eyes blinked.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong? You were the one who brought it up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-Well, just a moment ago, I... about Shizuru...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, I understood what Takanami-senpai was concerned about. She had once rejected me, yet she was trying to act as if it never happened. She was conflicted about it herself.</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine. I'm doing the same thing.&quot;</p>

<p>After all, I was the one who initially tried to do something so unrealistic. If she says that, it's like a dream come true.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad. Things can go back to how they were.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai smiled like a flower.</p>

<p>Somehow, her smile was dazzling, and I averted my gaze. Perhaps I wanted to escape from this situation.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/CJF9LSf/00025.jpg" alt="00025" border="0"></a>

<p>&quot;I'll go back first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, Shizuru.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai called out to me as I tried to pass by her and return to the counter.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, Shizuru...&quot;</p>

<p>For some reason, her pronunciation suddenly became unclear.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you really... like me?&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In response to her hesitant question, blushing, I unintentionally fell silent.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I say something like that...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yes, you did. Earlier, you definitely said it.&quot;</p>

<p>I tried to play it off somehow, but Takanami-senpai didn't back down.</p>

<p>In my heart, I looked up to the heavens.</p>

<p>I did say it. Maybe I let my guard down because I wasn't looking at her face while speaking. That's why I wanted to quickly leave in order to avoid being touched by her.</p>

<p>&quot;Just like I said earlier, I'm doubtful if it's genuine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it does exist, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>I boasted that I have feelings for her. However, it's embarrassing to have it confirmed by someone else. It's even more so when it's from the person herself.</p>

<p>Satisfied with my vague response, Takanami-senpai smiled once again.</p>

<p>&quot;...Let's go back.&quot;</p>

<p>I had asked Kanata-senpai to cover for me. I need to return soon.</p>

<p>&quot;Shizuru.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since we're here, why don't we have a kiss? I mentioned it before, didn't I? I've always dreamed of secretly kissing in the school library.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>I firmly declared, as a small resistance towards her.</p>
