<h1 style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 5: Makabe Shizuru Is Not Cut Out For Romance</b></h1>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h1 style="text-align: center">Act 1</h1>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">『Makabe Shizuru is stalking Takinami Ruika.』</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such rumors were being spread.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">More precisely, Makabe Shizuru is following her around, taking advantage of the fact that he’s a member of the library committee, and getting close to Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A guy in my class was kind enough to tell me. He also gave me advice, “Stop with the stalking.” </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They have no trust if I do say so myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But interestingly, there was no damage done.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the lunch break, after finishing my lunch, I looked around the classroom and said to Karube Kagemitsu.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to a classmate of mine, rumors started circulating during yesterday&#8217;s lunch break and have spread quite a lot.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But unfortunately, my name doesn’t ring any bells, so it halved the effectiveness of the rumor. After all, when someone hears that rumor, the first thing they would think of is who that guy is. In fact, when I went to the cafeteria to get a cup of coffee a few minutes ago, I didn&#8217;t hear anyone whispering anything to each other or blatantly pointing their finger behind my back when they saw my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rumors are more interesting the more famous the subjects are.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s how it is.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube stated nonchalantly, and I nodded in return.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why, rather than such half-baked rumors, the fact that Masaru-sensei used to be an aspiring opera singer is much more interesting. Masaru-sensei is a large man with a loud voice, and even when the doors and windows are closed, one can hear him speaking from the classroom next door. When I heard this story, I was deeply convinced.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who do you think is the source of the rumors?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Naoi.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube responded immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ahead of his gaze, Naoi&#8217;s group was happily making noise. There were less than ten people in the group, including several girls.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s possible.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had an argument with him just yesterday morning. That was enough to make him angry and give my name a bad stigma.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But Naoi would never do such a thing.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">But the timing is just too good. If it really was Naoi&#8217;s work, I have to say that it was shortsighted.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t understand why you regard Naoi so highly.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Half of it is just my ideals.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ideal that this is how Naoi is supposed to be. I&#8217;m just imposing that ideal on him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it’s not Naoi, then…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Karube then still looked at Naoi’s group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, who cares who did it? It will disappear soon. Especially since it’s not that interesting.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rumor has a short shelf life.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the library after school that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was at the check-out counter with my textbooks spread out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, found the delinquent librarian.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, I was called by such a nickname.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up and saw a beautiful senior student there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s more, a stalker.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She giggles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you hear about the rumors?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. How did that happen?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Takinami-senpai answered in this way, rather than tilting her head at the inexplicable, she seemed to be dismayed by the rumor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she has a good idea of where it came from.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That said, if my stalker is Makabe-kun, I would welcome it with open arms.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t think you should say that anywhere but here. You never know if some guy will misunderstand.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I reminded her, who was saying stuff in a playful manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shrugged her shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so. I’ll be careful. By the way, are you studying?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I was having a hard time understanding something in class today.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, taking advantage of the lack of students coming to the counter, I was reviewing the textbooks here instead of doing it at home.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, but I&#8217;ll do the rest when I get home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I close the textbook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have come to some understanding. The bigger problem is that my work as a member of the library committee might be neglected. Just like now, I was unaware of Takininami-senpai’s presence. I had assumed that I would be able to tell when a person would approach, but it seems that I was inadvertently absorbed in what I was doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why? Why not just do it here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I mean, you have a great teacher just in front of you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was looking only at Takinami-senpai, who was strangely cute and good at what she was doing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you implying that you’re going to teach me?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. I’m quite good at academics if I do say so myself. Shall we go to the reading table?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai said that and walked toward the reading tables.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was wondering what to do, she put her bag on the table by the window. She seemed to be sitting with her back to the counter. This would mean that I would be sitting with my back to the window, looking towards the counter. If someone comes in, they would be in my line of sight. If they are regulars, they might call out directly to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to take advantage of her kindness and quickly put a message on the counter, “Currently away.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We sat across from each other at the table. I spread out the textbook between us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, please do.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai smiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, wait a second.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed to have remembered something. Then she took an eyeglass case out of her bag. Naturally, there were glasses inside. They were slender and square-shaped, much like the ones I had seen at the store the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you buy one?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Of course, it’s just for show though. I never thought I would be able to use it so soon.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai smiled innocently as she spoke.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It must not have been a cheap purchase, but she bought it for a performance she never knows when will happen. Well, I guess she was going to make this development happen somehow though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai unbuttoned the top button of her blouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry for the wait. Here, go ahead.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, wait a minute.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai stopped moving while leaning to look over the textbook. I can almost see something beyond her wide-open collar.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean, what?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What if someone sees? Thinking so, I checked my surroundings and then realized. I realized that all the remaining students in the library were on the other side of the room. They could only see her backside even if they turned their head this way. I was the only one facing her from the front.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, this?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai looks at her own chest.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought it would motivate you. Being a serious yet alluring teacher.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the contrary, I’m so concerned about it that what I would be taught is bound to pass from my right ear to my left ear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Don’t you expect a reward afterward? Like, ‘Well done, alright, it’s time for the reward you’ve been waiting for.’”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then smiled meaningfully.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But soon, her face turns serious.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, get to it. Are you really motivated to do this?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s my line.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I were to refuse the reward, I would not be able to focus with her giving a lecture dressed like that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s see. I&#8217;ve done this once before, so you will get bored. I&#8217;ll think of a new situation.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s not the issue, though.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I sigh inwardly in disgust, Takinami-senpai asks me while buttoning up her blouse.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Shizuru. Where was the ‘Name of the Rose?’”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can tell you, but I won’t come to pick you up even if you’re starving.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to what I had heard before, Takinami Ruika had maintained excellent grades through hard work and was therefore very good at teaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When that was over, it was just time to close the library, so Takinami-senpai also left. I closed the library as usual and returned the key to the staff room before leaving school.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so it was when I came down to the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takinami-san, maybe you shouldn’t go to the library so often.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, why is that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The voice came unexpectedly, and I quickly hid myself behind the stairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The one who answered was, of course, Takinami-senpai. Even if her name had not been mentioned, I would have recognized her just by hearing her voice. But who was the other person? At least it was not Takajou-senpai&#8217;s calm, sweet voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Because, you know, that rumor.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Rumor?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai asks back.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a topic we had discussed just a few minutes before. There was no way she could have not known. But I guess she dared to ask back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The librarian is stalking you, Takinami-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that thing. It’s alright. He’s not the type of person who would do such a thing.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She smoothly said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But it&#8217;s also possible that he’ll misunderstand your intentions.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right, that’s right.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It appears that there are several people advising Takinami-senpai. Her classmates, probably.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard that after school, Takinami-senpai passes the time by chatting with her friends in the classroom and guiding them in their studies. I guess she came to the library after doing so today and rejoined the girls on her way home. I don&#8217;t know if it was by chance or by appointment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Besides, I don’t think it’s Takinami-san’s image to bother with a guy like that…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-Is it…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai responded with a puzzled look on her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think they’re saying the most reasonable things. I’m sure that they’re one of those who hold the ideal image of Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It doesn’t suit her image, huh…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mumbled to myself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I silently turned on my feet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ll tell the teacher I forgot something in the library, borrow the key, spend a little time there, and then leave.</span></p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got home thirty minutes later than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, Hasumi-senpai didn’t get angry at such little difference, nor did she ask me why I was late. Rather, she said she was glad that the timing coincided with Uncle&#8217;s return so that they don’t need to eat separately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, after dinner, at night―</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was in my room reviewing the lessons taught by Takinami-san, I heard a voice from outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I opened the door, Hasumi-senpai was standing there. She was wearing wide pants and a shirt, a very conservative fashion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I accidentally made two cups of coffee, so I’ll give you the other one.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, she had a cup of coffee in both hands. But what kind of accident is that? Was she playing or something?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was about to accept the cup, Hasumi-senpai quickly pulled it away. My hand shook.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Did something happen?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked at me with a straight face and asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like the other cup of coffee she accidentally made was for this. How perceptive.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing really.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you telling the truth?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai asked again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered her again, clearly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nothing in particular. My decision just happened naturally that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, good.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai finally handed me the cup.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you have something on your mind, you can tell me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, Hasumi-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was about to go back to her room, but I stopped her. Hasumi-senpai turns around and looks at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?” She asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why did you tell Naoi that we’re siblings?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why, huh…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She mumbled as she thought about the meaning of the question in her head and brought her coffee cup to her mouth. She leaned against the hallway wall.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve known Naoi since junior high school and I know he admires me. I guess I wanted to tell him the truth.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just about what I expected. She really cannot tell a lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai, you’re pretty sincere, did you know that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sincere? No way. It’s not that big of a deal.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai laughs, as if I said something outrageous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I really don’t want to tell a lie, you see. Once you lie, you either have to apologize afterwards or take it to your grave. Both are difficult for me to do.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I especially don&#8217;t want to lie about how I feel. It feels like I&#8217;m killing myself.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This thought Hasumi-senpai has must have been her true intention.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why it’s even more heartbreaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should have been like this. I should not have lied to Naoi. I should have believed him, believed myself, who wanted Naoi Kyouhei to be the kind of person I wanted him to be, and told him the truth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It feels like I’m killing myself, huh?’</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wish I had half as much sincerity as she did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In your eyes, Hasumi-senpai, I must look like I’m suffocating, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai thought for a moment, and then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before, sure. Now, it has reduced.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder who was talking about somebody else’s b*****s, saying he wants to see me in my swimsuit. Is that what you call faithful, or rather, loyal to your desires? Haah, what a perverted little brother I have.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was at a loss for words at Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s taunting words. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s fine. I’ll get angry if you go too far, but so far you haven’t. Though, I’ll really get angry if you go too far…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said it twice, as it was important. And the second time, she looked at me with stern eyes. I&#8217;ll be careful.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re saying whatever you want. Then, how about you saying something to Takinami-san too?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You like her, right? I don’t know what’s holding you back, but maybe you should say something to her and see how she reacts. Then, think about what you’ll do after seeing it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I could.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s right, the problem and solution were already there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But things were changing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Back to the topic―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I cut to the chase.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it&#8217;s better if you don&#8217;t mention that we are siblings anymore.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course, I’m not planning on going around saying it to people. I would need to mention Dad if that happens after all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai chuckles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That said, I don’t think we need to have a lie ready in case that’s where the conversation is heading.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Is she implicitly calling me out? Me, who tried to dodge the topic by saying we live nearby? No, that’s wrong. She doesn&#8217;t talk that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What, Shizuru? Do you think it’s lame for me to be your older sister?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, that’s not what…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather, it was the opposite. Takinami-senpai told me to have confidence in myself. However, only a few would think that not just anyone can do the job of a library committee. For many students who don&#8217;t think so, Makabe Shizuru is not cut out to be Hasumi Shion’s sibling. Nevertheless, if she reveals that I’m her younger brother, Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s image will worsen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What&#8217;s more, people were beginning to think that I’m a stalker.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry if it looks like I’m making you lie, Hasumi-senpai. But please keep the fact that I’m your brother a secret as much as possible. Thank you very much for the coffee…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? Ah, wait, Shizuru!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I one-sidedly ended the conversation and closed the door without hearing Hasumi&#8217;s reply.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s it for Hasumi-senpai. Takinami-senpai has already been decided. ―Then, all that’s left is Naoi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, let’s apologize to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi has replaced his own jealousy with anger at being lied to by me. There is no doubt about that. But it’s also true that I lied to him. First of all, I will apologize for that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had calculated that by doing so, I might be able to cut through his stubborn attitude, but more than that, I wanted to put my own mistakes to rest.</span></p>



<h2>Act 2</h2>

<p>The Next Day.</p>

<p>When I got on the train to go to school, Takinami Ruihan was there.</p>

<p>She stood holding onto the strap with one hand and had a textbook in the other. It was a different size from the school textbooks, so it was probably a commercially available workbook or reference book.</p>

<p>She was engrossed in reading and hadn't noticed me yet. I thought I should move a little further away and turn my back while I had the chance. But just as I thought that, she raised her face as if she were called. Naturally, she recognized me.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, good morning, Makabe-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Good morning.&quot;</p>

<p>I missed the timing to move away.</p>

<p>&quot;If you were here, you should have called out to me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You seemed to be studying.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I'm embarrassed...&quot;</p>

<p>Takinami-senpai blushed.</p>

<p>We faced each other near the door.</p>

<p>&quot;Always from this door?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I try to get on where it's open, so I don't have a fixed spot.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems that some people have not only the train schedule but also the specific door they get on determined when commuting or going to school. My classmate Heshikiri Kirigiri said she does that too. She said she feels anxious about doing something different from usual.</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Makabe-kun said he usually gets on a train around this time, so I tried delaying a little... Is this also fate?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you say things like that, guys will misunderstand... It's just a coincidence.&quot;</p>

<p>In her case, she's probably saying things that an ordinary guy would misunderstand, but she knows I won't.</p>

<p>Then, the train shook a little.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>It was a shake that would be manageable unless she was in a very unstable position. Nevertheless, Takinami-senpai lost her balance and fell into my chest.</p>

<p>&quot;!?&quot;</p>

<p>A very soft sensation filled me. Not in a weird way, but it felt like Takinami Ruihan herself was made of something soft. And for the first time being this close, I could smell her elegant fragrance tickling my nose.</p>

<p>&quot;Are you okay?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I'm sorry. I'm so...&quot;</p>

<p>Truly clumsy.</p>

<p>Moreover, instead of moving away, she leaned in closer.</p>

<p>&quot;Takinami-senpai.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine. You even let Takajou-san hug you from behind last time.&quot;</p>

<p>When I quietly called out her name as if reproaching her for that action, she looked up and whispered to me from such a close distance.</p>

<p>I let out a small sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;Makabe-kun?&quot;</p>

<p>She couldn't keep clinging to me forever, of course, so Takinami-senpai moved away. And then, she tilted her head, sensing something suspicious about my behavior.</p>

<p>I remained silent.</p>

<p>The train arrived at the Sogo Sports Park Station, and the doors opened behind me.</p>

<p>There were few passengers getting on or off at this station. On an average day, it's only about half to one-third of the students in the school city. Nobody got on or off from this door either.</p>

<p>An announcement informed us that the doors would soon close.</p>

<p>Just before the doors closed&mdash;I got off the train.</p>

<p>&quot;Shh...&quot;</p>

<p>Takinami-senpai's voice.</p>

<p>When I turned around, her face was wide-eyed on the other side of the closed doors. She was moving away from me at the same distance the train was moving, gradually disappearing from sight.</p>

<p>&quot;So that's it.&quot;</p>

<p>I consciously muttered those words.</p>

<p>In the morning, there are many trains. The intervals are short, three minutes at most, and long, six minutes at most. I'm not acting like I'm barely making it in time, so if I get on the next train, I</p>

<p>&sect;&sect;&sect;</p>

<p>After school.</p>

<p>After the closing ceremony, I slowly tidied up my belongings and looked around the classroom.</p>

<p>Naoki's group had already gathered. However, they would soon go their separate ways.</p>

<p>First, Naoki and his self-proclaimed partner, Murodo, had club activities for the handball team. There was another core member, Tatsuno, who was unaffiliated, so he would join a friend from our class whom he knew from the previous year. As for Izumikawa, he would go home alone.</p>

<p>Although Naoki's group appeared cohesive with a leader, their connections with each other were surprisingly weak.</p>

<p>After exchanging a few words, they dispersed. I followed Izumikawa as he left the classroom.</p>

<p>&quot;Izumikawa.&quot;</p>

<p>When I called out to him once he was alone, he startled and turned around.</p>

<p>&quot;W-What? Do you need something from me...?&quot;</p>

<p>He seemed overly nervous, perhaps because he didn't have any friends around or because he had something to hide.</p>

<p>&quot;There's something I want to ask you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...?&quot;</p>

<p>I could tell that Izumikawa was wary of me since I approached him personally, so he remained silent.</p>

<p>&quot;Did you spread that rumor?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-What!? Wh-What evidence do you have to accuse me of that!?&quot;</p>

<p>I'm sure Izumikawa had an inkling of what I was going to say. Despite being on guard, he panicked when I hit the mark. In a way, his reaction could be considered evidence.</p>

<p>By raising his voice, he attracted the attention of nearby students, making him shrink back awkwardly.</p>

<p>&quot;Izumikawa, you've misunderstood.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Misunderstood?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. I'm not the police. Even without solid evidence, it's enough to say that it was probably you. Since you spread baseless rumors yourself, isn't it a draw now? All that's left is for me to ask Naoki to do something about you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;S-Stop it...&quot;</p>

<p>Izumikawa let out a scream-like voice.</p>

<p>As high school students, we couldn't exactly report this to the teachers. So, the only option left was to tell Naoki, the leader of Izumikawa's group. He was an upright guy who would definitely verify the facts with Izumikawa rather than sweeping it under the rug. And Izumikawa feared being abandoned by Naoki more than receiving guidance from a teacher.</p>

<p>&quot;I-I have evidence, you know. I saw it with my own eyes. Last Sunday, at Harborland, Makabe was with Takinami.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>It seems that Izumikawa didn't spread the rumors solely based on our interactions at school. He actually saw it. He saw me and Takinami together in an outdoor location on Sunday. Rennami-senpai was also there, but she had already gone home from Harborland.</p>

<p>In reality, that alone didn't prove that I was constantly following Takinami, but Izumikawa deliberately twisted the truth there.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter with you? Being friendly with both Renami-san and Takinami-san. That's unfair to Kyosuke-kun. Kyosuke-kun has feelings for Renami-san...&quot;</p>

<p>Perhaps hesitating to say it out loud, Izumikawa left the last part vague.</p>

<p>&quot;I see...&quot;</p>

<p>I unintentionally muttered.</p>

<p>Izumikawa didn't approach Naoki just because he wanted to have a fun high school life. There were genuine feelings of admiration towards Naoki as well. That's why he noticed Izumikawa's faint affection for Renami-senpai and sensed the recent changes.</p>

<p>As Karibe deduced, Izumikawa feared that Naoki's growing fondness for me would lower his own standing in comparison, potentially leading to his exclusion from the group. However, his primary intention was to eliminate me, prioritizing Naoki's interests. That's why he spread negative rumors about me.</p>

<p>I might have misjudged Izumikawa Jyu.</p>

<p>&quot;What's the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just... I thought Izumikawa was considerate of his friends, that's all.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Izumikawa seemed to want to say something like, &quot;Why are you saying that to me?&quot;</p>

<p>He cares about his friends. That's why I need to make this clear.</p>

<p>&quot;But Izumikawa, Naoki is an upright guy. He won't approve of what you've done.&quot;</p>

<p>Immediately after, Izumikawa came to a halt.</p>

<p>I also stopped and faced him.</p>

<p>&quot;S-Stop it. Besides, if it weren't for Makabe...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I understand. So leave the rest to me. I'll take care of Naoki.&quot;</p>

<p>Just like Izumikawa, I also want to do something about Naoki. The problem is that I haven't come up with a concrete plan yet, as much as I think about it.</p>

<p>Before I realized it, we were at the staircase. Izumikawa would go downstairs and head home, while I would go to the library.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, Izumikawa. See you tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;H-Hey...&quot;</p>

<p>I lightly tapped Izumikawa's shoulder twice and parted ways with him.</p>

<p>For now, only the members of Naoki's group might have noticed that something is off with him. But Naoki is an attention-grabbing individual. It's only a matter of time before it spreads throughout the class.</p>

<p>I need to do something before it reaches that point.</p>

<h2>Act 3</h2>

<p>After-school library.</p>

<p>Takanami Ruihua appeared slightly earlier than usual.</p>

<p>&quot;Hello, Makabe-kun.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hello.&quot;</p>

<p>The usual greeting.</p>

<p>But it didn't continue from there. Takanami-senpai seemed like she wanted to say something, but hesitated, standing in front of the counter.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, about this morning...&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, she gathered her courage and spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;I went too far with the prank. I'm sorry. I was probably too excited because I actually saw you on the train I took, thinking I might meet you.&quot;</p>

<p>She apologized, looking apologetic.</p>

<p>&quot;No, I was also in the wrong. It wasn't something that warranted such impulsive actions. I'm sorry.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, and you're not at fault for being hugged by Takaj&#333;-san either.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, that person seems to enjoy that kind of joke.&quot;</p>

<p>I smiled wryly, feeling troubled.</p>

<p>&quot;But really, Takanami-senpai, as someone of your standing, getting so excited just by meeting me... I think it's a bit much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>Then Takanami-senpai moved her face a little closer. And in a hushed voice, as if having a secret conversation, she continued.</p>

<p>&quot;Be careful when there are people around.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even when there's no one around. It's important to do things properly when no one is watching. It's surprising how often slacking off goes unnoticed when no one is watching... My late mother used to say that.&quot;</p>

<p>I replied to her mischievous remark, trying to keep the atmosphere light since she had brought up my recently deceased mother.</p>

<p>&quot;I think those are wise words.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai returned her face to its original position, wearing a faintly puzzled expression.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, we're going to watch a movie tomorrow.&quot;</p>

<p>She changed the topic.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that's right. It's just watching one movie and then it's over, so it's easy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;We'll disband around early afternoon. Makabe-kun, if you'd like, how about having lunch together?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's a kind offer, but I'll decline. I don't want to make enemies out of all the guys in school.&quot;</p>

<p>I politely declined.</p>

<p>This wasn't just a pose or anything, it was more than half serious. As Takanami-senpai and I said, tomorrow we will watch a movie and disperse by early afternoon. Many students who are friends eat lunch together and hang out. I don't know where Akane-dai High School students are, or rather, they must be everywhere. In such a situation, I can't possibly have lunch with Takanami Ruihua without feeling terrified.</p>

<p>&quot;I understand. But we still have time. Let me know if you change your mind.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai smiled kindly, like a considerate upperclassman.</p>

<p>Soon, the bell rang. The remaining students began packing their belongings with faces that said, &quot;Is it already that time?&quot;</p>

<p>Just after the other students except Kanata-senpai left the room,</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Shizuru? If Sannomiya doesn't work, there's a hidden gem not far from there. How about going there?&quot;</p>

<p>She changed her tone to a casual one as usual.</p>

<p>&quot;No matter how many times you ask, my answer won't change. ...Hey, Takanami-senpai, please go home now. The library will be closing soon.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, Shizuru.&quot;</p>

<p>She immediately interjected.</p>

<p>&quot;I've been curious since earlier. What's with that way of speaking?&quot;</p>

<p>With a stern expression, she asked.</p>

<p>No matter what she says, this is the attitude towards someone superior, right?</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, that's right. That's the proper way. But it shouldn't be the case with me. Shizuru is the one who speaks rudely and disrespectfully.&quot;</p>

<p>Looking at it calmly, she's really a troublesome underclassman.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm trying to correct that attitude.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Stop it. Don't give me those ordinary fake smiles. Don't speak to me like a polite underclassman.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai and I faced each other.</p>

<p>She glared at me, and I let her gaze flow past me.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Shizuru. What are you angry about? If it's about this morning, I already apologized, didn't I? Or are you still angry after all?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not angry.&quot;</p>

<p>In the first place, I wasn't angry from the beginning.</p>

<p>&quot;Takanami-senpai, it's almost closing time. Please get ready to leave.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wha!?&quot;</p>

<p>When I calmly informed her as the library committee member, she choked up slightly.</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai glared at me again, picked up her bag that was at her feet, and left the library. Her back wasn't slouched, her pace wasn't quickened by anger, but it was very resolute.</p>

<p>My chest felt a little tight.</p>

<p>It's the same guilt as this morning. It's okay. Eventually, I'll become numb to it. No, maybe Takanami-senpai will get tired of me first.</p>

<p>&quot;It was an amusing spectacle.&quot;</p>

<p>As I stared at the entrance where Takanami-senpai's figure disappeared, I heard a voice from behind. When I turned around, Kanata-senpai was standing, lightly resting her buttocks on the table.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't think Takanami will give up so easily.&quot;</p>

<p>I guess Kanata-senpai is right. But if I don't ask for that, I'll be in trouble.</p>

<p>&quot;You don't ask for the reason.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can figure out what you're thinking.&quot;</p>

<p>She said it so easily. ...Well, even I think I'm being shortsighted.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that enough for you?&quot;</p>

<p>Kanata-senpai continued to ask.</p>

<p>It's not about whether it's good or bad for me. This is the best way. The correct answer won't come unless I treat all the elements equally.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that so? From my perspective, it seems like you're actually avoiding the most important element. Isn't it that you need to treat it equally to find the right answer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What is this important element you're talking about?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm surprised. Are you so foolish as to ask me that?&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I couldn't help but fall silent.</p>

<p>&quot;Besides, you're mistaken.&quot;</p>

<p>Coincidentally, those were the same words I said to Izumikawa during lunch break.</p>

<p>&quot;Why do you have to find the right answer?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>A foolish sound slipped out of my mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;Whether it's right or wrong doesn't matter. Think about what you want and find your own answer.&quot;</p>

<p>Upon closer look, Kanata-senpai was already prepared to leave.</p>

<p>&quot;The right answer is surprisingly easy to find. It's just that even if you know what's right in your head, you may not be able to do it, and a series of right answers doesn't necessarily lead to the right path.&quot;</p>

<p>With that, Kanata-senpai left the library.</p>

<p>&quot;With profound words...&quot;</p>

<p><h2>Arc 3</h2></p>

<p>The next day.</p>

<p>It's the day for the movie outing.</p>

<p>Since it's not an elementary or middle school field trip, we gather at the theater in Sannomiya at 9 a.m.</p>

<p>The Renmi Mansion is far from Sannomiya, even though the meeting time is later than the start of school, so I could take it a bit easier than usual.</p>

<p>I finished getting ready a little before 8 o'clock and descended from my room to the living room.</p>

<p>But Renmi-senpai is even faster than me. She was reading a book as usual. I'm starting to think that she's unexpectedly a bookworm. Next time I have a chance, I should recommend Shisouichiro to her.</p>

<p>&quot;You're early.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't have a bento today, so I have extra time.&quot;</p>

<p>Renmi-senpai answered while closing her book.</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? But what about Ojisan...?&quot;</p>

<p>Last night, there was no night shift, and Renmi-san came home as usual. We had breakfast together this morning, and she left a little while ago. We don't need a packed lunch, but Ojisan should need one.</p>

<p>&quot;It would be mean to make her make her own, so she said she doesn't need one today. She'll eat at the hospital cafeteria. It's not much different whether she makes one or three lunches.&quot;</p>

<p>Renmi-senpai said with a wry smile, but there was no mocking tone in her words. She must have been happy that we cared about her.</p>

<p>Certainly, there isn't much difference between one and three, but there's a big difference between zero and one. As the numbers suggest, it becomes the difference between doing it or not.</p>

<p>I looked at Renmi-senpai's outfit again.</p>

<p>Today, she seems to be going out in a fashion of a loose-fitting hoodie with a hood and denim long pants. I felt relieved.</p>

<p>&quot;What's with that reaction?&quot;</p>

<p>Renmi-senpai said, her face twisted, so the first sound came out as a strange pronunciation. ...She's sharp. Even though I didn't think I showed it in my face or attitude.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, no, it's nothing...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;When Shizuka says that, she's definitely thinking of something bad. ...Just say it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even though I know you're not thinking of something good, why do I still want to hear it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't beat around the bush.&quot;</p>

<p>Renmi-senpai had a tone that didn't allow for refusal.</p>

<p>I carefully chose my words and then spoke.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, it's just that it's a good thing you didn't wear an outfit that would make men happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot;</p>

<p>As a result, my expression became strangely convoluted, and Renmi-senpai asked back.</p>

<p>&quot;Renmi-senpai has a great figure, so if you wear clothes that show off your body lines too much, it would make men very happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, I see. But if I say that, aren't you one of the men who would be very happy?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I won't deny that.</p>

<p>Not to the extent of being &quot;great,&quot; though.</p>

<p>&quot;Just that it annoys me when other guys are happy.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're really honest in strange ways.&quot;</p>

<p>Renmi-senpai laughs heartily.</p>

<p>&quot;I've always believed that a society where honest people are made fools is not a good one.&quot;</p>

<p>And for some reason, she starts saying things like a sociologist.</p>

<p>&quot;I agree with that.&quot;</p>

<p>It shouldn't be the case that those who live honestly suffer while those who don't gain.</p>

<p>&quot;Honest people should have something in return. I'm wearing a tank top that fits quite snugly underneath this hoodie... Want to see?&quot;</p>

<p>Suddenly, Renmi-senpai says that while pinching the neckline of her hoodie with her finger.</p>

<p>Her tone was somewhat provocative and challenging.</p>

<p>&quot;Is that okay?&quot;</p>

<p>I also return her gaze directly while answering.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>Renmi-senpai and I glare at each other.</p>

<p>Eventually,</p>

<p>&quot;Sorry. It's impossible.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry too. I'll refrain after all.&quot;</p>

<p>We both give in, simultaneously uttering those words.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, normally I wear it as loungewear, so I should be fine with showing it, but I feel resistant to showing it voluntarily.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not bold enough to openly look at it either.&quot;</p>

<p>It seems like this contest ended in a draw.</p>

<p>&quot;You've unwittingly become like Takinami-san, but you're surprisingly capable of doing such things.&quot;</p>

<p>Renmi-senpai says, sounding exasperated.</p>

<p>&quot;Come on, instead of doing foolish things, go quickly.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're one to talk, even though you did it yourself.&quot;</p>

<p>Urged by Renmi-senpai's words, which feel like she's shooing me away, I turn on my heel to leave.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, by the way, Shizuka.&quot;</p>

<p>Renmi-senpai stops me with those words.</p>

<p>&quot;When you come back, why not go on a date with Takinami-san?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, I'll pass.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I-I see...?&quot;</p>

<p>Without even thinking, those words come out of my mouth, causing Renmi-senpai to blink in surprise.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>When I went to the movie theater in Sannomiya, the lobby and even the front were overflowing with Akane-dai High School students.</p>

<p>Naturally so, since all the students had gathered here.</p>

<p>With so many students in one place, it was impossible for everyone to watch the movie together. We were divided into several screens. I moved to the floor where the screen assigned to my class was located.</p>

<p>There, I found Karibe Keiko and Heshikiri Sakura and joined them.</p>

<p>Today's movie was not something popular but rather part of our school's curriculum.</p>

<p>&quot;Oroshiya Kokuzui Muzan&quot; (lit. &quot;The Descending Nation Dream&quot;), based on a novel.</p>

<p>It depicted the story of the ship &quot;Shinsho Maru&quot; carrying seventeen people, including Daikokuya Koutarou, drifting to Russia and searching for a way back home despite losing comrades in the harsh cold. It seemed to have been produced more than a quarter of a century ago.</p>

<p>&quot;I've already read the novel, so watching the movie might not be interesting. I heard they cut out some episodes that were in the original,&quot; Heshikiri said with a wry smile.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, there's a novel?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, there is. By Inoue Yasushi. I think our school library has it too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's good to know. Worst-case scenario, I can write a review after reading the novel.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, it wasn't just about watching the movie. We would also be required to write our impressions.</p>

<p>&quot;It would take more time to grasp the content from the novel compared to the movie. It's quite troublesome to deliberately choose the more difficult option,&quot; Karibe commented.</p>

<p>&quot;You're right.&quot;</p>

<p>So, in the worst-case scenario, unless I fall asleep to the point of not understanding the content, I wouldn't need to rely on the novel to supplement it.</p>

<p>&quot;All students, please go to your respective homeroom teachers, state your names, and then enter,&quot; a teacher's voice suddenly came through the loudspeakers. Similar announcements were probably being made outside and in the lobby as well.</p>

<p>I looked around. There he was, Mr. Asaba.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go and inform him,&quot; I said to Karibe and Heshikiri, then started swimming through the sea of people toward Mr. Asaba.</p>

<p>&quot;Mr. Asaba, Makabe is here. Also, Karibe and Heshikiri are coming too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, Makabe, sorry, but I've been told to confirm attendance by seeing their faces. Could you tell Karibe and Heshikiri to come over here?&quot;</p>

<p>Mr. Asaba said reluctantly.</p>

<p>&quot;Understood.&quot;</p>

<p>In other words, to avoid situations where friends falsely declare attendance on behalf of others who aren't present.</p>

<p>And so, with these events, the movie screening began at 10 o'clock, and it ended without any incidents.</p>

<p>The students were released by early afternoon.</p>

<h2>Act 4</h2>

<p>And so the week began.</p>

<p>The school event of watching movies and the once-a-year bonus stage were already in the past, and it was just another typical Monday.</p>

<p>I had decided that today I would finally talk to Naoki. I couldn't postpone it any longer.</p>

<p>During lunch break, after the fourth period ended, I put away my textbooks and notes in my bag and took out my lunchbox instead. While preparing myself mentally and thinking, &quot;Let's go to Naoki's place,&quot; I turned around and he was right in front of me.</p>

<p>&quot;Ah...&quot;</p>

<p>Both of us muttered softly.</p>

<p>A slightly awkward atmosphere filled the air.</p>

<p>&quot;Makabe.&quot;</p>

<p>After a moment, Naoki opened his mouth first as if he had made up his mind.</p>

<p>&quot;What is it? I also have a lunch today.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No, it's not about that.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course, I didn't think that Naoki had come to invite me to the school cafeteria.</p>

<p>Then, as if he realized something, his neatly shaped eyebrows twitched.</p>

<p>&quot;That lunchbox... um...&quot;</p>

<p>Naoki's gaze was directed towards the lunchbox I had taken out of my bag.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, my sister made it for me. Not some relative aunt or anything.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You should get scolded once.&quot;</p>

<p>Naoki awkwardly chuckled.</p>

<p>Seeing him like that, I thought to myself. I felt that Naoki had somehow let go of something.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm jealous.&quot;</p>

<p>After saying that, he nodded as if he had come to a realization.</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, I envied you, Makabe. And I kept taking it out on you... Well, you understand why, right?&quot;</p>

<p>Naoki asked hesitantly.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not that oblivious.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thanks... So, I'm sorry. I was out of line.&quot;</p>

<p>Naoki lightly bowed as a gesture. I didn't expect him to bow deeply, so this was enough.</p>

<p>He knew that what he was doing was taking out his frustrations on me. It must have been difficult for him, considering he had the perspective to understand it. Humans have impulses that they can't control even on their own.</p>

<p>So, is it my turn now?</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry too.&quot;</p>

<p>I lowered my head to Naoki, just as he did.</p>

<p>&quot;What's with you suddenly? There's nothing for Makabe to apologize to me about.&quot;</p>

<p>Naoki widened his eyes at my sudden action.</p>

<p>No, I shouldn't have lied to Naoki. I made a mistake from the very beginning.</p>

<p>&quot;It's normal to hide the mess at home.&quot;</p>

<p>Naoki smiled refreshingly, but I shook my head.</p>

<p>&quot;Naoki is a person with great tolerance. If I explained properly, you would have accepted it. But I forgot about that and took the easy way out with a simple lie.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're overthinking it. In reality, it was like that.&quot;</p>

<p>Naoki chuckled with a self-deprecating tone, reflecting on his own actions.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, the fact that Makabe thought of me in that way, I'm even more unable to win now.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Unable to win?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>When I asked him back, Naoki nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;After hearing Rokumi's story, I thought I couldn't win against you, Makabe. I wondered if I could do the same thing myself, but I couldn't find an answer. Makabe is strong. To be able to do something like that to protect someone.&quot;</p>

<p>Naoki's face had a bright expression as he said that. I see. That must be the reason he returned to his neutral state.</p>

<p>You won't know if you can do it or not until you stand in that situation. I think even Naoki can do it if it's to protect someone. No, he'll do it even better than me.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm not so sure about that.&quot;</p>

<p>Naoki responded with an ambiguous agreement.</p>

<p>&quot;But still, both of us are pretty pathetic.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;After all, we ended up coming this far with the arrangements from Rokumi-senpai.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;True.&quot;</p>

<p>We were scolded together by Rokumi-senpai as if we were fighting. Furthermore, I realized my mistake from her words.</p>

<p>&quot;Rokumi-senpai said that she doesn't want to lie because she's close to Naoki. At the very least, she's already in that position. What happens next depends on Naoki.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Thank you. I'll do my best... So, what about Makabe?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What about me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Don't play dumb. It's about Takinami-senpai, obviously. We even ate together at the school cafeteria the other day. There's no other guy like that. Don't just say we're seniors and juniors.&quot;</p>

<p>He lightly nudged my chest with his fist.</p>

<p>&quot;I can't compare with Takinami-senpai.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You always say that.&quot;</p>

<p>Naoki scratched his head in exasperation.</p>

<p>&quot;...Hey, Makabe. Sometimes you feel it yourself, and sometimes people around you make a fuss about it, but don't you think that's just noise in the end? Because ultimately, it doesn't matter. In that case, you just shouldn't care about that noise from the beginning. After that, it's up to you, Makabe.&quot;</p>

<p>It's up to me&mdash;that's what I told Naoki just a while ago.</p>

<p>He had a serious expression on his face.</p>

<p>&quot;Be true to your own emotions...&quot;</p>

<p>Thinking that I couldn't deceive him, I said it.</p>

<p>&quot;What's that?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's the words of someone I respect.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Those are good words. And there's already an answer there.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Maybe.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes. The answer is there.</p>

<p>My new answer.</p>

<p>After all, it's up to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Kyosuke, let's go already!&quot;</p>

<p>I heard Izumikawa's voice. Tension was evident in his tone. I looked and saw him, Mudou, and Tateno waiting for Naoki at the entrance of the classroom.</p>

<p>&quot;He seems angry. Maybe he's hungry and on edge.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;You're saying that even though you know,&quot; Naoki sighed in exasperation.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll tell Izumikawa.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just enough. I don't dislike Izumikawa that much.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I really don't feel like I can win against Makabe... Well then.&quot;</p>

<p>Saying that, Naoki walked away. He would probably go to the cafeteria with the rest of our usual group.</p>

<p>&quot;Now then...&quot;</p>

<p>I consciously pronounced those words.</p>

<p>I'll have my lunch too. As usual, I'll bring my lunchbox and head towards Karube and Heshikiri's place.</p>

<p>As I casually glanced outside the window, the rainy season sky still remained, even though we were already in July. It would have been nice if the sky cleared up, now that Naoki and I had reconciled. The sky can't read the mood.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>After school in the library.</p>

<p>The ominous clouds that had covered the sky unleashed a steady rain in the afternoon. With the unpredictable weather these days, which can turn into sudden heavy rain or thunderstorms, some of the regular students seemed to go straight home after classes. It's anyone's guess whether leaving school early is fortunate or unfortunate, as only the gods know. One thing I know for sure is that there are fewer users in the library today than usual.</p>

<p>As I sat at the counter in the library, I pondered whether Takinami-senpai would come today.</p>

<p>She might not come. No, she probably won't come. After all, I had rejected her invitation, almost like giving her an ultimatum. We should have definitively broken off. There's no reason for her to come here anymore.</p>

<p>I bitterly regret not going after her myself. Since there are so few users anyway, it wouldn't have been a problem if I didn't open today.</p>

<p>Time passed.</p>

<p>Outside, the rain continued to pour heavily. Takinami-senpai probably went home early as well. I hope she managed to leave when the rain was lighter.</p>

<p>And then, about thirty minutes before closing time.</p>

<p>Someone arrived at a time like this, on a day like this. They must not be a student at this point. Could it be a teacher who came to do some research? Thinking that, I looked up at the presence, and there stood Takinami Namika.</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...&quot;</p>

<p>We locked eyes and fell into silence.</p>

<p>I hadn't expected Takinami-senpai to appear, so I was speechless. But what was she thinking with this silence?</p>

<p>She was the first to avert her gaze.</p>

<p>She passed by the counter and took a seat at one of the reading desks. It was as if she was completely ignoring my presence.</p>

<p>Maybe it's because the final exams are just ten days away. She took out textbooks, notes, and writing utensils from her bag placed on the seat next to her. It seemed like she was going to study.</p>

<p>I put a sign on the counter that read, &quot;Currently away from the seat. Will be back soon,&quot; and made up my mind to stand up. I went over to Takinami-senpai.</p>

<p>&quot;Can we talk for a bit?&quot;</p>

<p>I spoke up.</p>

<p>However, she didn't seem to care about me standing right beside her. She flipped through the textbook as if searching for where she had left off last time. Was she intentionally ignoring me?</p>

<p>Eventually, Takinami-senpai found the page she was looking for and left the textbook open.</p>

<p>&quot;I was planning to solve a couple of questions before leaving. Will it be quick?&quot;</p>

<p>She looked up and asked me while gazing at me.</p>

<p>&quot;Probably not.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I see. Then go ahead and ask. Let's go outside.&quot;</p>

<p>Takinami-senpai stood up swiftly. She headed towards the entrance of the library, and I followed behind.</p>

<p>The place we relocated to was the corridor just outside the library. If we left the entrance door open, we could still see the counter from here and easily notice if someone entered.</p>

<p>In the hallway in front of the library, I stood face to face with Takinami-senpai.</p>

<p>Naturally, there was no smile on her face. But on the other hand, she wasn't angry either. She seemed to be waiting, ready to hear what I had to say.</p>

<p>Now, how should I approach this conversation? I'm about to say something really embarrassing. I wish I could at least start smoothly.</p>

<p>Having said that we had something to talk about and dragged her out here, I hadn't said anything yet, so Takinami-senpai let out a sigh.</p>

<p>&quot;I...,&quot;</p>

<p>She began speaking, her expression and tone were very calm.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought that Shizuru's sudden change in attitude was because of my foolishness on the train. But the real reason is about that rumor, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I guess so.&quot;</p>

<p>I answered.</p>

<p>As she said, that's probably one of the reasons. Although it's not that dominant.</p>

<p>&quot;That kind of rumor is just stupid. It's not true at all. Shizuru herself should know that best.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, the truth or falsehood of the rumor doesn't matter. The essence of rumors is that 'anything interesting goes.' Truth and accuracy come second.&quot;</p>

<p>What supports the rumor system is the relationship between those who want to tell exaggerated but interesting stories to attract attention and those who want to hear interesting stories regardless of their truthfulness.</p>

<p>&quot;In that regard, it's much more interesting if I were a stalker.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's ridiculous.&quot;</p>

<p>Takinami-senpai laughed sarcastically.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it's ridiculous and irresponsible. But Takinami-senpai, haven't you also enjoyed spreading rumors before?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;...Yes, I have.&quot;</p>

<p>She seemed to have an idea and simply affirmed it with a brief response.</p>

<p>Of course, I have an idea too. While eating lunch with Karibe and Heshikiri-san, we talked about the rumors we overheard. I can recall a couple of them just by racking my memory for a bit, and there are probably some that I can't remember. I've uttered stories that I don't even know if they're true or not, and I don't even remember those instances. It's irresponsible to a fault. But rumors are perfect for filling in the gaps in a conversation. That's what rumors are all about.</p>

<p>&quot;So, you want to distance yourself from me?&quot; she asked.</p>

<p>&quot;I thought I wasn't fit for the role. It would tarnish the image of Takinami Ruka as a brand,&quot; I replied.</p>

<p>Whether the stalker rumors are true or false, many students wouldn't approve of Takinami Ruka engaging in friendly conversations or having meals together with a male student. I've already exposed such scenes to the public eye, but now that negative rumors have spread, I thought it was the right time to step back.</p>

<p>Takinami Ruka is beautiful, intelligent, and refined. She treats everyone equally and kindly, but she's a bit difficult for underclassmen to approach. That's how it should be, and that's how it ought to be. It's not appropriate for an ordinary male student like me to receive special treatment from her.</p>

<p>That's what I believe.</p>

<p>I believed that.</p>

<p>&quot;But that was a mistake.&quot;</p>

<p>Yes, another mistake.</p>

<p>Just as I shouldn't have lied to Naohi Ky&#333;hei, I shouldn't have lied here either.</p>

<p>To myself.</p>

<p>To Takinami Ruka.</p>

<p>I have feelings for Takinami Ruka. That's undeniably true. There might be a question of whether these feelings are genuine or fabricated. But by focusing too much on that and turning a blind eye to my own feelings, wouldn't I be lying to myself? And by determining my attitude towards Takinami Ruka based on that, wouldn't I be lying to her?</p>

<p>Every time I pushed Takinami Ruka away, I was overwhelmed by guilt.</p>

<p>Now I understand. That pain in my chest was the agony of lying to oneself, as Rennami-senpai had mentioned.</p>

<p>&quot;That was a mistake?&quot;</p>

<p>Takinami Ruka asked in response.</p>

<p>&quot;Yes, it was a mistake. I did want you to be the ideal Takinami Ruka. But I shouldn't have forced that ideal onto you.&quot;</p>

<p>I remember saying that myself at some point. I was glad that I got to know her true self. Why didn't I stick to that feeling?</p>

<p>Naohi Ky&#333;hei said it too. What others say is just noise. No, even your own thoughts can become noise. Cut out the noise and make the decision yourself.</p>

<p>&quot;I apologize for my attitude in the past few days. So...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's selfish of you.&quot;</p>

<p>Takinami Ruka didn't let me finish.</p>

<p>She dismissed it in just one line.</p>

<p>&quot;How dare you try to distance yourself unilaterally and then realize it was a mistake? You want to start over from scratch. Isn't that right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I think so.&quot;</p>

<p>Of course I think so. There's no one more self-centered than me.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, you already know the answer, right? Don't disturb my feelings any further. Don't make me angry.&quot;</p>

<p>Takinami Ruka said coldly and turned on her heels, returning to the library.</p>

<p>I was the only one left in the hallway.</p>

<p>It's only natural for her to be angry. It's absurd to expect her to accept my apology and pretend it never happened</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Even though Takinami-senpai was inside, it would be foolish to return to the same place. I felt like just going home, but I had a role as a library committee member and a responsibility. I had to fulfill my daily tasks.</p>

<p>I returned to the library and took a seat at the counter. And just then, as if waiting for that moment, Kanata-senpai arrived.</p>

<p>&quot;Shizuru, the magazine I'm looking for is not here.&quot;</p>

<p>She brought up the matter suddenly. I didn't have time to think about unnecessary things, so I was somewhat relieved.</p>

<p>&quot;Just to be sure, let me search here as well. What magazine is it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;It's 'Sad&#333;' (&#33590;&#36947;, tea ceremony).&quot;</p>

<p>I typed as instructed and performed the search. If I narrowed down the results to magazines, there was only one that included that string of characters. It must be this one.</p>

<p>I displayed the bibliographic information and checked the details. Even though they had stopped accepting new issues before I entered the school, they still had the back issues. The placement should be on the magazine's back issue shelf, and there were no changes to the magazine title. Confirming each detail one by one, I finally understood after double-checking the title.</p>

<p>&quot;Kanata-senpai, where did you look?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;On the back issue shelf, under the 'Sa' section.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;If you look closely, the title is pronounced as 'Chad&#333;' (&#12385;&#12419;&#12393;&#12358;). I think you'll find it if you search under the 'Ta' section.&quot;</p>

<p>I had a feeling I had heard about it on TV. The head of the tea ceremony pronounced it as 'Chad&#333;.' It seemed that this specialized magazine for tea ceremony was also pronounced as 'Chad&#333;.'</p>

<p>&quot;I'll give it a try.&quot;</p>

<p>Without even saying thanks, she headed towards the bookshelf where the back issues were stored. It was unusual for Kanata-senpai, who specialized in history, to overlook something like this. Perhaps when I mentioned it, she suddenly remembered.</p>

<p>Before long, Kanata-senpai returned. In her hand was a single magazine. She came all the way to show it to me.</p>

<p>&quot;I found it.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's great.&quot;</p>

<p>Feeling a small joy in having been helpful, I nodded.</p>

<p>&quot;It seems Takinami is not here.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh?&quot;</p>

<p>Prompted by Kanata-senpai's words, I looked towards the reading area, and indeed, Takinami-senpai was not there. The texts were left as they were, so maybe he was searching for a book that could be helpful somewhere, or perhaps he had stepped out of the library for some reason.</p>

<p>&quot;You went out with Takinami earlier. What did you talk about?&quot;</p>

<p>Looking intently at the empty seat, Kanata-senpai asked me.</p>

<p>&quot;Nothing much. It wasn't an important conversation.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I can guess the general idea.&quot;</p>

<p>Probably. If so, why did she ask?</p>

<p>&quot;'Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again and expecting different results.'&quot;</p>

<p>Kanata-senpai suddenly uttered those words.</p>

<p>&quot;Wasn't that Einstein?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;People tend to think so, but it has been spreading that he didn't actually say it.&quot;</p>

<p>So it seems it wasn't Einstein.</p>

<p>&quot;And what's the meaning behind it?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Even if you repeat useless things countless times, it remains useless. It's better to realize it sooner.&quot;</p>

<p>Kanata-senpai said it as if praising me.</p>

<p>&quot;In my interpretation, it means if you can't achieve the desired results by repeating an experiment, it's due to the lack of reproducibility. It suggests considering a different approach. However, that's assuming it's the quote from physicist Einstein.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;In physics, there is only one conclusion that can be derived from a single event. No matter how many times you repeat an experiment with incorrect assumptions, you cannot obtain the desired result.</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know who said those words, but they sound like a denial of the idea of continuing to challenge without giving up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And then?&quot;</p>

<p>Souta-senpai asks.</p>

<p>&quot;What do you want, from me?&quot;</p>

<p>It was clear from the beginning, without even asking such a question.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm sorry, Souta-senpai. Can you watch the counter for me? I'll step away for a bit.&quot;</p>

<p>Saying that, I leave the counter.</p>

<p>I never had any intention of giving up. If that's the case, it's better to act quickly.</p>

<p>&quot;You've got quite the courage.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't feel comfortable leaving it unattended multiple times. Just sitting here is enough. Besides, no one will come anyway.&quot;</p>

<p>To begin with, there are few users today. And if they realize that Souta-senpai is at the counter, they will surely turn back.</p>

<p>&quot;By the way, please take responsibility for instigating this.&quot;</p>

<p>I leave the counter to Souta-senpai and head towards the back of the bookshelf.</p>

<p>I enter the second-to-last row from the very back. It's the section for English literature, and there's even the original version of 'Harry Potter'.</p>

<p>There, I open my mouth calmly.</p>

<p>&quot;There's something I want to ask you.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh!?&quot;</p>

<p>There is a faint sign of someone holding their breath from the backmost row behind the bookshelf.</p>

<p>That's right. Takanami Reika is on the other side.</p>

<p>She said before that the farthest back of the bookshelf is the best place for thinking and being alone. That's why she came here.</p>

<p>&quot;There is something fatally missing in me.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Missing?&quot;</p>

<p>I hear Takanami-senpai's voice.</p>

<p>We continue the conversation without seeing each other.</p>

<p>&quot;I know how to behave and what expression to show depending on the situation at that time. But because I'm too good at it, I can't help but doubt if my own feelings are artificial.&quot;</p>

<p>This is the first time I'm telling Takanami-senpai about this.</p>

<p>&quot;In other words, I can't have confidence in my own feelings.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Is it like what Shizuru often said, that you're not suited for love?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah. Don't you find it funny? Even though I can objectively see the situation, including myself, I have no idea about my own feelings at the center.&quot;</p>

<p>I unintentionally self-deride.</p>

<p>&quot;I like Takanami-senpai. There are times when I doubt if my feelings are genuine. But no matter how much I think about it, those feelings are certainly within me, and they haven't disappeared. With these feelings, I want to face Takanami-senpai.&quot;</p>

<p>This is my utmost sincerity at the moment.</p>

<p>However, it may not be convincing to Takanami-senpai. After all, it's like saying, &quot;I like you,&quot; without knowing for sure if I truly feel that way. There couldn't be a more insincere statement. Moreover, just a little over ten minutes ago, she rejected me. Will it be so easily overturned?</p>

<p>But her response was not an answer.</p>

<p>&quot;I also have it to some extent.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai speaks quietly.</p>

<p>&quot;I told you, right? That there are times when I feel like I might be 'empty.'&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>She keenly senses what others expect from her and has become the present &quot;Takanami Reika&quot; by meeting those expectations. However, because of that, she feels lacking in agency and &quot;empty.&quot;</p>

<p>On the day we first met, Takanami-senpai posed a question to me.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you have a proper sense of 'self'?&quot;</p>

<p>And...</p>

<p>We are similar.</p>

<p>We observe ourselves and our surroundings from a bird's-eye view, and based on that, determine the right way to act. Takanami-senpai takes a long-term perspective, while I take a short-term one. That's the only difference.</p>

<p>That's why Takanami-senpai calls me a &quot;kindred spirit.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But I have Shizuru. With Shizuru, who has the same eyes and sees the same things, I don't have to meet the expectations of those around me. I don't feel 'empty.' I can believe that I have a proper 'self.'&quot;</p>

<p>That's right. That's why Takanami-senpai is her true self in front of me. While I wonder if it's okay for me, at the same time, I feel a slight sense of superiority about it.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Shizuru?&quot;</p>

<p>The voice calling my name didn't come from behind the bookshelf but from the side. I turn towards that direction.</p>

<p>And there stood Takanami Reika.</p>

<p>&quot;Just as I have Shizuru, don't you think Shizuru has me? That's what I believe.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...&quot;</p>

<p>The words don't smoothly register in my mind, and I ask in return.</p>

<p>&quot;Because when we're alone together, Shizuru, you don't use honorifics and you're not friendly, right? But I think that's the real Shizuru, and there are no lies there.&quot;</p>

<p>Indeed, I adopt such an attitude only in front of her.</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai saw through that I adapt my expressions and choose my words according to the situation. I thought that if I continued doing such things in front of her, who had seen through it, it would expose my vulnerable self.</p>

<p>&quot;...Maybe.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai and I are similar. To borrow her words, we are &quot;kindred spirits.&quot; If that's the case, just as Takanami-senpai's &quot;self&quot; is by my side, perhaps my &quot;self&quot; that doesn't doubt my own emotions is also by Takanami-senpai's side.</p>

<p>&quot;That's why, I think you should find out for yourself. Just keep being together as usual.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai suggests with a somewhat hesitant tone.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, maybe that's for the best.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;R-Really...?&quot;</p>

<p>For some reason, her eyes blinked.</p>

<p>&quot;What's wrong? You were the one who brought it up.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;W-Well, just a moment ago, I... about Shizuru...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>Finally, I understood what Takanami-senpai was concerned about. She had once rejected me, yet she was trying to act as if it never happened. She was conflicted about it herself.</p>

<p>&quot;It's fine. I'm doing the same thing.&quot;</p>

<p>After all, I was the one who initially tried to do something so unrealistic. If she says that, it's like a dream come true.</p>

<p>&quot;I'm glad. Things can go back to how they were.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai smiled like a flower.</p>

<p>Somehow, her smile was dazzling, and I averted my gaze. Perhaps I wanted to escape from this situation.</p>

<p>&quot;I'll go back first.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Wait, Shizuru.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai called out to me as I tried to pass by her and return to the counter.</p>

<p>&quot;Um, Shizuru...&quot;</p>

<p>For some reason, her pronunciation suddenly became unclear.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you really... like me?&quot;</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>In response to her hesitant question, blushing, I unintentionally fell silent.</p>

<p>&quot;Did I say something like that...?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Y-Yes, you did. Earlier, you definitely said it.&quot;</p>

<p>I tried to play it off somehow, but Takanami-senpai didn't back down.</p>

<p>In my heart, I looked up to the heavens.</p>

<p>I did say it. Maybe I let my guard down because I wasn't looking at her face while speaking. That's why I wanted to quickly leave in order to avoid being touched by her.</p>

<p>&quot;Just like I said earlier, I'm doubtful if it's genuine.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;But it does exist, right?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yeah.&quot;</p>

<p>I boasted that I have feelings for her. However, it's embarrassing to have it confirmed by someone else. It's even more so when it's from the person herself.</p>

<p>Satisfied with my vague response, Takanami-senpai smiled once again.</p>

<p>&quot;...Let's go back.&quot;</p>

<p>I had asked Kanata-senpai to cover for me. I need to return soon.</p>

<p>&quot;Shizuru.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What now?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since we're here, why don't we have a kiss? I mentioned it before, didn't I? I've always dreamed of secretly kissing in the school library.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;No.&quot;</p>

<p>I firmly declared, as a small resistance towards her.</p>
