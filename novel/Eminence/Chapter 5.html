<h2>Act 2</h2>

The Next Day.

When I got on the train to go to school, Takinami Ruihan was there.

She stood holding onto the strap with one hand and had a textbook in the other. It was a different size from the school textbooks, so it was probably a commercially available workbook or reference book.

She was engrossed in reading and hadn't noticed me yet. I thought I should move a little further away and turn my back while I had the chance. But just as I thought that, she raised her face as if she were called. Naturally, she recognized me.

"Oh, good morning, Makabe-kun."

"Good morning."

I missed the timing to move away.

"If you were here, you should have called out to me."

"You seemed to be studying."

"Oh, I'm embarrassed..."

Takinami-senpai blushed.

We faced each other near the door.

"Always from this door?"

"No, I try to get on where it's open, so I don't have a fixed spot."

It seems that some people have not only the train schedule but also the specific door they get on determined when commuting or going to school. My classmate Heshikiri Kirigiri said she does that too. She said she feels anxious about doing something different from usual.

"I see. Makabe-kun said he usually gets on a train around this time, so I tried delaying a little... Is this also fate?"

"If you say things like that, guys will misunderstand... It's just a coincidence."

In her case, she's probably saying things that an ordinary guy would misunderstand, but she knows I won't.

Then, the train shook a little.

"Ah!"

It was a shake that would be manageable unless she was in a very unstable position. Nevertheless, Takinami-senpai lost her balance and fell into my chest.

"!?"

A very soft sensation filled me. Not in a weird way, but it felt like Takinami Ruihan herself was made of something soft. And for the first time being this close, I could smell her elegant fragrance tickling my nose.

"Are you okay?"

"I-I'm sorry. I'm so..."

Truly clumsy.

Moreover, instead of moving away, she leaned in closer.

"Takinami-senpai."

"It's fine. You even let Takajou-san hug you from behind last time."

When I quietly called out her name as if reproaching her for that action, she looked up and whispered to me from such a close distance.

I let out a small sigh.

"Makabe-kun?"

She couldn't keep clinging to me forever, of course, so Takinami-senpai moved away. And then, she tilted her head, sensing something suspicious about my behavior.

I remained silent.

The train arrived at the Sogo Sports Park Station, and the doors opened behind me.

There were few passengers getting on or off at this station. On an average day, it's only about half to one-third of the students in the school city. Nobody got on or off from this door either.

An announcement informed us that the doors would soon close.

Just before the doors closed—I got off the train.

"Shh..."

Takinami-senpai's voice.

When I turned around, her face was wide-eyed on the other side of the closed doors. She was moving away from me at the same distance the train was moving, gradually disappearing from sight.

"So that's it."

I consciously muttered those words.

In the morning, there are many trains. The intervals are short, three minutes at most, and long, six minutes at most. I'm not acting like I'm barely making it in time, so if I get on the next train, I

§§§

After school.

After the closing ceremony, I slowly tidied up my belongings and looked around the classroom.

Naoki's group had already gathered. However, they would soon go their separate ways.

First, Naoki and his self-proclaimed partner, Murodo, had club activities for the handball team. There was another core member, Tatsuno, who was unaffiliated, so he would join a friend from our class whom he knew from the previous year. As for Izumikawa, he would go home alone.

Although Naoki's group appeared cohesive with a leader, their connections with each other were surprisingly weak.

After exchanging a few words, they dispersed. I followed Izumikawa as he left the classroom.

"Izumikawa."

When I called out to him once he was alone, he startled and turned around.

"W-What? Do you need something from me...?"

He seemed overly nervous, perhaps because he didn't have any friends around or because he had something to hide.

"There's something I want to ask you."

"...?"

I could tell that Izumikawa was wary of me since I approached him personally, so he remained silent.

"Did you spread that rumor?"

"W-What!? Wh-What evidence do you have to accuse me of that!?"

I'm sure Izumikawa had an inkling of what I was going to say. Despite being on guard, he panicked when I hit the mark. In a way, his reaction could be considered evidence.

By raising his voice, he attracted the attention of nearby students, making him shrink back awkwardly.

"Izumikawa, you've misunderstood."

"Misunderstood?"

"Yeah. I'm not the police. Even without solid evidence, it's enough to say that it was probably you. Since you spread baseless rumors yourself, isn't it a draw now? All that's left is for me to ask Naoki to do something about you."

"S-Stop it..."

Izumikawa let out a scream-like voice.

As high school students, we couldn't exactly report this to the teachers. So, the only option left was to tell Naoki, the leader of Izumikawa's group. He was an upright guy who would definitely verify the facts with Izumikawa rather than sweeping it under the rug. And Izumikawa feared being abandoned by Naoki more than receiving guidance from a teacher.

"I-I have evidence, you know. I saw it with my own eyes. Last Sunday, at Harborland, Makabe was with Takinami."

"..."

It seems that Izumikawa didn't spread the rumors solely based on our interactions at school. He actually saw it. He saw me and Takinami together in an outdoor location on Sunday. Rennami-senpai was also there, but she had already gone home from Harborland.

In reality, that alone didn't prove that I was constantly following Takinami, but Izumikawa deliberately twisted the truth there.

"What's the matter with you? Being friendly with both Renami-san and Takinami-san. That's unfair to Kyosuke-kun. Kyosuke-kun has feelings for Renami-san..."

Perhaps hesitating to say it out loud, Izumikawa left the last part vague.

"I see..."

I unintentionally muttered.

Izumikawa didn't approach Naoki just because he wanted to have a fun high school life. There were genuine feelings of admiration towards Naoki as well. That's why he noticed Izumikawa's faint affection for Renami-senpai and sensed the recent changes.

As Karibe deduced, Izumikawa feared that Naoki's growing fondness for me would lower his own standing in comparison, potentially leading to his exclusion from the group. However, his primary intention was to eliminate me, prioritizing Naoki's interests. That's why he spread negative rumors about me.

I might have misjudged Izumikawa Jyu.

"What's the matter?"

"Just... I thought Izumikawa was considerate of his friends, that's all."

"Huh?"

Izumikawa seemed to want to say something like, "Why are you saying that to me?"

He cares about his friends. That's why I need to make this clear.

"But Izumikawa, Naoki is an upright guy. He won't approve of what you've done."

Immediately after, Izumikawa came to a halt.

I also stopped and faced him.

"S-Stop it. Besides, if it weren't for Makabe..."

"I understand. So leave the rest to me. I'll take care of Naoki."

Just like Izumikawa, I also want to do something about Naoki. The problem is that I haven't come up with a concrete plan yet, as much as I think about it.

Before I realized it, we were at the staircase. Izumikawa would go downstairs and head home, while I would go to the library.

"Well then, Izumikawa. See you tomorrow."

"H-Hey..."

I lightly tapped Izumikawa's shoulder twice and parted ways with him.

For now, only the members of Naoki's group might have noticed that something is off with him. But Naoki is an attention-grabbing individual. It's only a matter of time before it spreads throughout the class.

I need to do something before it reaches that point.

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

After-school library.

Takanami Ruihua appeared slightly earlier than usual.

"Hello, Makabe-kun."

"Hello."

The usual greeting.

But it didn't continue from there. Takanami-senpai seemed like she wanted to say something, but hesitated, standing in front of the counter.

"Um, about this morning..."

Finally, she gathered her courage and spoke.

"I went too far with the prank. I'm sorry. I was probably too excited because I actually saw you on the train I took, thinking I might meet you."

She apologized, looking apologetic.

"No, I was also in the wrong. It wasn't something that warranted such impulsive actions. I'm sorry."

"No, and you're not at fault for being hugged by Takajō-san either."

"Well, that person seems to enjoy that kind of joke."

I smiled wryly, feeling troubled.

"But really, Takanami-senpai, as someone of your standing, getting so excited just by meeting me... I think it's a bit much."

"Yeah."

Then Takanami-senpai moved her face a little closer. And in a hushed voice, as if having a secret conversation, she continued.

"Be careful when there are people around."

"Even when there's no one around. It's important to do things properly when no one is watching. It's surprising how often slacking off goes unnoticed when no one is watching... My late mother used to say that."

I replied to her mischievous remark, trying to keep the atmosphere light since she had brought up my recently deceased mother.

"I think those are wise words."

Takanami-senpai returned her face to its original position, wearing a faintly puzzled expression.

"By the way, we're going to watch a movie tomorrow."

She changed the topic.

"Yes, that's right. It's just watching one movie and then it's over, so it's easy."

"We'll disband around early afternoon. Makabe-kun, if you'd like, how about having lunch together?"

"It's a kind offer, but I'll decline. I don't want to make enemies out of all the guys in school."

I politely declined.

This wasn't just a pose or anything, it was more than half serious. As Takanami-senpai and I said, tomorrow we will watch a movie and disperse by early afternoon. Many students who are friends eat lunch together and hang out. I don't know where Akane-dai High School students are, or rather, they must be everywhere. In such a situation, I can't possibly have lunch with Takanami Ruihua without feeling terrified.

"I understand. But we still have time. Let me know if you change your mind."

Takanami-senpai smiled kindly, like a considerate upperclassman.

Soon, the bell rang. The remaining students began packing their belongings with faces that said, "Is it already that time?"

Just after the other students except Kanata-senpai left the room,

"Hey, Shizuru? If Sannomiya doesn't work, there's a hidden gem not far from there. How about going there?"

She changed her tone to a casual one as usual.

"No matter how many times you ask, my answer won't change. ...Hey, Takanami-senpai, please go home now. The library will be closing soon."

"Wait, Shizuru."

She immediately interjected.

"I've been curious since earlier. What's with that way of speaking?"

With a stern expression, she asked.

No matter what she says, this is the attitude towards someone superior, right?

"Yes, that's right. That's the proper way. But it shouldn't be the case with me. Shizuru is the one who speaks rudely and disrespectfully."

Looking at it calmly, she's really a troublesome underclassman.

"I'm trying to correct that attitude."

"Stop it. Don't give me those ordinary fake smiles. Don't speak to me like a polite underclassman."

Takanami-senpai and I faced each other.

She glared at me, and I let her gaze flow past me.

"Hey, Shizuru. What are you angry about? If it's about this morning, I already apologized, didn't I? Or are you still angry after all?"

"I'm not angry."

In the first place, I wasn't angry from the beginning.

"Takanami-senpai, it's almost closing time. Please get ready to leave."

"Wha!?"

When I calmly informed her as the library committee member, she choked up slightly.

Takanami-senpai glared at me again, picked up her bag that was at her feet, and left the library. Her back wasn't slouched, her pace wasn't quickened by anger, but it was very resolute.

My chest felt a little tight.

It's the same guilt as this morning. It's okay. Eventually, I'll become numb to it. No, maybe Takanami-senpai will get tired of me first.

"It was an amusing spectacle."

As I stared at the entrance where Takanami-senpai's figure disappeared, I heard a voice from behind. When I turned around, Kanata-senpai was standing, lightly resting her buttocks on the table.

"I don't think Takanami will give up so easily."

I guess Kanata-senpai is right. But if I don't ask for that, I'll be in trouble.

"You don't ask for the reason."

"I can figure out what you're thinking."

She said it so easily. ...Well, even I think I'm being shortsighted.

"Is that enough for you?"

Kanata-senpai continued to ask.

It's not about whether it's good or bad for me. This is the best way. The correct answer won't come unless I treat all the elements equally.

"Is that so? From my perspective, it seems like you're actually avoiding the most important element. Isn't it that you need to treat it equally to find the right answer?"

"What is this important element you're talking about?"

"I'm surprised. Are you so foolish as to ask me that?"

...

I couldn't help but fall silent.

"Besides, you're mistaken."

Coincidentally, those were the same words I said to Izumikawa during lunch break.

"Why do you have to find the right answer?"

"Huh?"

A foolish sound slipped out of my mouth.

"Whether it's right or wrong doesn't matter. Think about what you want and find your own answer."

Upon closer look, Kanata-senpai was already prepared to leave.

"The right answer is surprisingly easy to find. It's just that even if you know what's right in your head, you may not be able to do it, and a series of right answers doesn't necessarily lead to the right path."

With that, Kanata-senpai left the library.

"With profound words..."

<h2>Arc 3</h2>

The next day.

It's the day for the movie outing.

Since it's not an elementary or middle school field trip, we gather at the theater in Sannomiya at 9 a.m.

The Renmi Mansion is far from Sannomiya, even though the meeting time is later than the start of school, so I could take it a bit easier than usual.

I finished getting ready a little before 8 o'clock and descended from my room to the living room.

But Renmi-senpai is even faster than me. She was reading a book as usual. I'm starting to think that she's unexpectedly a bookworm. Next time I have a chance, I should recommend Shisouichiro to her.

"You're early."

"I don't have a bento today, so I have extra time."

Renmi-senpai answered while closing her book.

"Huh? But what about Ojisan...?"

Last night, there was no night shift, and Renmi-san came home as usual. We had breakfast together this morning, and she left a little while ago. We don't need a packed lunch, but Ojisan should need one.

"It would be mean to make her make her own, so she said she doesn't need one today. She'll eat at the hospital cafeteria. It's not much different whether she makes one or three lunches."

Renmi-senpai said with a wry smile, but there was no mocking tone in her words. She must have been happy that we cared about her.

Certainly, there isn't much difference between one and three, but there's a big difference between zero and one. As the numbers suggest, it becomes the difference between doing it or not.

I looked at Renmi-senpai's outfit again.

Today, she seems to be going out in a fashion of a loose-fitting hoodie with a hood and denim long pants. I felt relieved.

"What's with that reaction?"

Renmi-senpai said, her face twisted, so the first sound came out as a strange pronunciation. ...She's sharp. Even though I didn't think I showed it in my face or attitude.

"Oh, no, it's nothing..."

"When Shizuka says that, she's definitely thinking of something bad. ...Just say it."

"Even though I know you're not thinking of something good, why do I still want to hear it?"

"Don't beat around the bush."

Renmi-senpai had a tone that didn't allow for refusal.

I carefully chose my words and then spoke.

"Well, it's just that it's a good thing you didn't wear an outfit that would make men happy."

"What's that?"

As a result, my expression became strangely convoluted, and Renmi-senpai asked back.

"Renmi-senpai has a great figure, so if you wear clothes that show off your body lines too much, it would make men very happy."

"Oh, I see. But if I say that, aren't you one of the men who would be very happy?"

"Well, I won't deny that.

Not to the extent of being "great," though.

"Just that it annoys me when other guys are happy."

"You're really honest in strange ways."

Renmi-senpai laughs heartily.

"I've always believed that a society where honest people are made fools is not a good one."

And for some reason, she starts saying things like a sociologist.

"I agree with that."

It shouldn't be the case that those who live honestly suffer while those who don't gain.

"Honest people should have something in return. I'm wearing a tank top that fits quite snugly underneath this hoodie... Want to see?"

Suddenly, Renmi-senpai says that while pinching the neckline of her hoodie with her finger.

Her tone was somewhat provocative and challenging.

"Is that okay?"

I also return her gaze directly while answering.

"..."

"..."

Renmi-senpai and I glare at each other.

Eventually,

"Sorry. It's impossible."

"I'm sorry too. I'll refrain after all."

We both give in, simultaneously uttering those words.

"Well, normally I wear it as loungewear, so I should be fine with showing it, but I feel resistant to showing it voluntarily."

"I'm not bold enough to openly look at it either."

It seems like this contest ended in a draw.

"You've unwittingly become like Takinami-san, but you're surprisingly capable of doing such things."

Renmi-senpai says, sounding exasperated.

"Come on, instead of doing foolish things, go quickly."

"You're one to talk, even though you did it yourself."

Urged by Renmi-senpai's words, which feel like she's shooing me away, I turn on my heel to leave.

"Oh, by the way, Shizuka."

Renmi-senpai stops me with those words.

"When you come back, why not go on a date with Takinami-san?"

"No, I'll pass."

"I-I see...?"

Without even thinking, those words come out of my mouth, causing Renmi-senpai to blink in surprise.

<p style="text-align:center;">§§§/p>

When I went to the movie theater in Sannomiya, the lobby and even the front were overflowing with Akane-dai High School students.

Naturally so, since all the students had gathered here.

With so many students in one place, it was impossible for everyone to watch the movie together. We were divided into several screens. I moved to the floor where the screen assigned to my class was located.

There, I found Karibe Keiko and Heshikiri Sakura and joined them.

Today's movie was not something popular but rather part of our school's curriculum.

"Oroshiya Kokuzui Muzan" (lit. "The Descending Nation Dream"), based on a novel.

It depicted the story of the ship "Shinsho Maru" carrying seventeen people, including Daikokuya Koutarou, drifting to Russia and searching for a way back home despite losing comrades in the harsh cold. It seemed to have been produced more than a quarter of a century ago.

"I've already read the novel, so watching the movie might not be interesting. I heard they cut out some episodes that were in the original," Heshikiri said with a wry smile.

"Oh, there's a novel?"

"Yeah, there is. By Inoue Yasushi. I think our school library has it too."

"That's good to know. Worst-case scenario, I can write a review after reading the novel."

Of course, it wasn't just about watching the movie. We would also be required to write our impressions.

"It would take more time to grasp the content from the novel compared to the movie. It's quite troublesome to deliberately choose the more difficult option," Karibe commented.

"You're right."

So, in the worst-case scenario, unless I fall asleep to the point of not understanding the content, I wouldn't need to rely on the novel to supplement it.

"All students, please go to your respective homeroom teachers, state your names, and then enter," a teacher's voice suddenly came through the loudspeakers. Similar announcements were probably being made outside and in the lobby as well.

I looked around. There he was, Mr. Asaba.

"I'll go and inform him," I said to Karibe and Heshikiri, then started swimming through the sea of people toward Mr. Asaba.

"Mr. Asaba, Makabe is here. Also, Karibe and Heshikiri are coming too."

"Ah, Makabe, sorry, but I've been told to confirm attendance by seeing their faces. Could you tell Karibe and Heshikiri to come over here?"

Mr. Asaba said reluctantly.

"Understood."

In other words, to avoid situations where friends falsely declare attendance on behalf of others who aren't present.

And so, with these events, the movie screening began at 10 o'clock, and it ended without any incidents.

The students were released by early afternoon.
