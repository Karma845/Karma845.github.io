<h2>Act 2</h2>

The Next Day.

When I got on the train to go to school, Takinami Ruihan was there.

She stood holding onto the strap with one hand and had a textbook in the other. It was a different size from the school textbooks, so it was probably a commercially available workbook or reference book.

She was engrossed in reading and hadn't noticed me yet. I thought I should move a little further away and turn my back while I had the chance. But just as I thought that, she raised her face as if she were called. Naturally, she recognized me.

"Oh, good morning, Makabe-kun."

"Good morning."

I missed the timing to move away.

"If you were here, you should have called out to me."

"You seemed to be studying."

"Oh, I'm embarrassed..."

Takinami-senpai blushed.

We faced each other near the door.

"Always from this door?"

"No, I try to get on where it's open, so I don't have a fixed spot."

It seems that some people have not only the train schedule but also the specific door they get on determined when commuting or going to school. My classmate Heshikiri Kirigiri said she does that too. She said she feels anxious about doing something different from usual.

"I see. Makabe-kun said he usually gets on a train around this time, so I tried delaying a little... Is this also fate?"

"If you say things like that, guys will misunderstand... It's just a coincidence."

In her case, she's probably saying things that an ordinary guy would misunderstand, but she knows I won't.

Then, the train shook a little.

"Ah!"

It was a shake that would be manageable unless she was in a very unstable position. Nevertheless, Takinami-senpai lost her balance and fell into my chest.

"!?"

A very soft sensation filled me. Not in a weird way, but it felt like Takinami Ruihan herself was made of something soft. And for the first time being this close, I could smell her elegant fragrance tickling my nose.

"Are you okay?"

"I-I'm sorry. I'm so..."

Truly clumsy.

Moreover, instead of moving away, she leaned in closer.

"Takinami-senpai."

"It's fine. You even let Takajou-san hug you from behind last time."

When I quietly called out her name as if reproaching her for that action, she looked up and whispered to me from such a close distance.

I let out a small sigh.

"Makabe-kun?"

She couldn't keep clinging to me forever, of course, so Takinami-senpai moved away. And then, she tilted her head, sensing something suspicious about my behavior.

I remained silent.

The train arrived at the Sogo Sports Park Station, and the doors opened behind me.

There were few passengers getting on or off at this station. On an average day, it's only about half to one-third of the students in the school city. Nobody got on or off from this door either.

An announcement informed us that the doors would soon close.

Just before the doors closed—I got off the train.

"Shh..."

Takinami-senpai's voice.

When I turned around, her face was wide-eyed on the other side of the closed doors. She was moving away from me at the same distance the train was moving, gradually disappearing from sight.

"So that's it."

I consciously muttered those words.

In the morning, there are many trains. The intervals are short, three minutes at most, and long, six minutes at most. I'm not acting like I'm barely making it in time, so if I get on the next train, I

After school.

After the closing ceremony, I slowly tidied up my belongings and looked around the classroom.

Naoki's group had already gathered. However, they would soon go their separate ways.

First, Naoki and his self-proclaimed partner, Murodo, had club activities for the handball team. There was another core member, Tatsuno, who was unaffiliated, so he would join a friend from our class whom he knew from the previous year. As for Izumikawa, he would go home alone.

Although Naoki's group appeared cohesive with a leader, their connections with each other were surprisingly weak.

After exchanging a few words, they dispersed. I followed Izumikawa as he left the classroom.

"Izumikawa."

When I called out to him once he was alone, he startled and turned around.

"W-What? Do you need something from me...?"

He seemed overly nervous, perhaps because he didn't have any friends around or because he had something to hide.

"There's something I want to ask you."

"...?"

I could tell that Izumikawa was wary of me since I approached him personally, so he remained silent.

"Did you spread that rumor?"

"W-What!? Wh-What evidence do you have to accuse me of that!?"

I'm sure Izumikawa had an inkling of what I was going to say. Despite being on guard, he panicked when I hit the mark. In a way, his reaction could be considered evidence.

By raising his voice, he attracted the attention of nearby students, making him shrink back awkwardly.

"Izumikawa, you've misunderstood."

"Misunderstood?"

"Yeah. I'm not the police. Even without solid evidence, it's enough to say that it was probably you. Since you spread baseless rumors yourself, isn't it a draw now? All that's left is for me to ask Naoki to do something about you."

"S-Stop it..."

Izumikawa let out a scream-like voice.

As high school students, we couldn't exactly report this to the teachers. So, the only option left was to tell Naoki, the leader of Izumikawa's group. He was an upright guy who would definitely verify the facts with Izumikawa rather than sweeping it under the rug. And Izumikawa feared being abandoned by Naoki more than receiving guidance from a teacher.

"I-I have evidence, you know. I saw it with my own eyes. Last Sunday, at Harborland, Makabe was with Takinami."

"..."

It seems that Izumikawa didn't spread the rumors solely based on our interactions at school. He actually saw it. He saw me and Takinami together in an outdoor location on Sunday. Rennami-senpai was also there, but she had already gone home from Harborland.

In reality, that alone didn't prove that I was constantly following Takinami, but Izumikawa deliberately twisted the truth there.

"What's the matter with you? Being friendly with both Renami-san and Takinami-san. That's unfair to Kyosuke-kun. Kyosuke-kun has feelings for Renami-san..."

Perhaps hesitating to say it out loud, Izumikawa left the last part vague.

"I see..."

I unintentionally muttered.

Izumikawa didn't approach Naoki just because he wanted to have a fun high school life. There were genuine feelings of admiration towards Naoki as well. That's why he noticed Izumikawa's faint affection for Renami-senpai and sensed the recent changes.

As Karibe deduced, Izumikawa feared that Naoki's growing fondness for me would lower his own standing in comparison, potentially leading to his exclusion from the group. However, his primary intention was to eliminate me, prioritizing Naoki's interests. That's why he spread negative rumors about me.

I might have misjudged Izumikawa Jyu.

"What's the matter?"

"Just... I thought Izumikawa was considerate of his friends, that's all."

"Huh?"

Izumikawa seemed to want to say something like, "Why are you saying that to me?"

He cares about his friends. That's why I need to make this clear.

"But Izumikawa, Naoki is an upright guy. He won't approve of what you've done."

Immediately after, Izumikawa came to a halt.

I also stopped and faced him.

"S-Stop it. Besides, if it weren't for Makabe..."

"I understand. So leave the rest to me. I'll take care of Naoki."

Just like Izumikawa, I also want to do something about Naoki. The problem is that I haven't come up with a concrete plan yet, as much as I think about it.

Before I realized it, we were at the staircase. Izumikawa would go downstairs and head home, while I would go to the library.

"Well then, Izumikawa. See you tomorrow."

"H-Hey..."

I lightly tapped Izumikawa's shoulder twice and parted ways with him.

For now, only the members of Naoki's group might have noticed that something is off with him. But Naoki is an attention-grabbing individual. It's only a matter of time before it spreads throughout the class.

I need to do something before it reaches that point.
