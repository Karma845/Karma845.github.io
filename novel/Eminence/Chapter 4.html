<h2>Chapter 4: The World is at Peace Today</h2>

<p>&#8220;They broke in to the deepest end, huh &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Fenrir muttered in the white fog.</p>



<p>A pool of blood and two footprints remain in front of the intact device.</p>



<p>&#8220;They could have destroyed the device. I guess they realized they didn&#8217;t have enough magic power &#8230;&#8230; No, but even if they did, they should have destroyed it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Bloody footprints pass between the devices and lead to the back door.</p>



<p>&#8220;The door will not open unless the seal is broken. I wonder what they broke in for&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Fenrir walked to the door where Diabolos&#8217; right arm was sealed.</p>



<p>Then, he realizes that the defense mechanism has been activated.</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder if Lili pushed them back.&#8221;</p>



<p>That was the only reason he could come up with.</p>



<p>One way or another, Shadow Garden will show up again. There is not much time left.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Looks like you&#8217;re in trouble.&#8221;</p>

<p>At that moment, a voice echoed from the white fog.</p>



<p>Fenrir immediately turned around and released his sword. The sword pressure cracked the fog.</p>



<p>There was one priest there.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, scary.&#8221;</p>



<p>He gives a thin smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;Petos &#8230;&#8230; You should at least say hi. I almost killed you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It has been a while, 5th seat of Rounds Fenrir-sama. You are indeed a great swordsman. It chilled my liver.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Hmph.&#8221;</p>



<p>That blow that Fenrir had just released with the intention of killing him. With his original ability, Petos would not have been able to prevent it.</p>



<p>But Petos is not wounded. He is an unpleasant man.</p>



<p>&#8220;If I were to fight normally, I would not be able to win.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder if you are the kind of man who fights normally. Tenth Seat of Rounds, Petos-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fenrir said so as if to throw up.</p>



<p>&#8220;So what do you want?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You seemed to be having trouble. I thought I might be able to help.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you think I would let a fiend like you help me?&#8221;</p>



<p>Fenrir laughs with a snort.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oya, to be called fiend is unexpected. I&#8217;m just loyal to the cult.&#8221;</p>



<p>Petos said with a deepening smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;I ask again. What are you doing here Petos? We&#8217;re not even close to making small talk.&#8221;</p>



<p>The smile faded from Petos&#8217; face as Fenrir filled the room with killing intent.</p>



<p>&#8220;The repeated failures of the Fenrir faction have become a problem at the Round Table. It seems that the release of the Right Arm has also been delayed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Petos glanced at the cylindrical device.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d say progress is at about 60%.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sixty percent, huh &#8230;&#8230; As you may know, the collapse of the sanctuary has freed up the left arm. This year, the number of drops is expected to decrease even more.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is Aurora still refusing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, more than usual. She continues to refuse. Perhaps her ego is returning to her after being released.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s troublesome&#8230;&#8230; So, how many drops?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I would say nine drops&#8230;&#8230; but it might be eight. Fortunately, thanks to the Shadow Garden, the number of Rounds itself is decreasing &#8230;&#8230; oops, that was inappropriate.&#8221;</p>



<p>Petos chuckled at what was funny.</p>



<p>&#8220;If there are fewer drops than expected&#8230;&#8230; or if new Rounds are appointed. Fenrir-sama, you will not have one this year.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve grown big, Petos.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fenrir unleashes a sword filled with bloodlust.</p>



<p>It slashed through Petos&#8217; coat and created a thin streak of blood on his neck.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oops&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You think you&#8217;re equal to me now, just because you&#8217;re a newcomer?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This was decided at the Round Table. I am only here to tell you that. The Round Table takes the failure of the Fenrir faction that much more seriously.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fenrir suppresses his killing intent with a small click of his tongue.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Did Loki instigate it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Loki is the head of a faction that has long been hostile to Fenrir.</p>



<p>&#8220;Loki-sama too&#8230;&#8230;He was present at the meeting.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I guess you agreed too, Petos. Because you might lose your share of the drops.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m always on Fenrir-sama&#8217;s side.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fenrir snorted at Petos&#8217; words.</p>



<p>&#8220;If anything, it was the fault of the cult for neglecting the Shadow Garden. It was about five years ago that it was first reported. The incident in which a demon-possession carriage was attacked by an unidentified group. If we had responded to the situation there, it wouldn&#8217;t have escalated as much as it did.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;There was something like that, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As a result of having sat on eternal life, the cult became as dull as a fattened pig. In addition to the originally vacant twelve seats, Nelson and Mordred have fallen. What a decline in the quality of the Rounds! You are just a replacement for the ten seats that Shadow killed two years ago. Under normal circumstances, someone like you would not have been able to become a member of the Rounds.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In a way, I owe the Shadow Garden for making me a Rounds, you know. I&#8217;m grateful to them.&#8221;</p>



<p>Petos said mockingly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Excuse me, my mouth slipped &#8230;&#8230; However, the round table is finally lifting their heavy hand. They&#8217;re serious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That plan&#8230;&#8230; “Shadow-hunting Jaw” huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Will it work?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like the idea of Loki as an ally, but it&#8217;s a good start. We&#8217;ll have to find out. Whether Shadow&#8217;s ability is real or not?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Do you think it&#8217;s fake?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that. But if it is real, it is too unrealistic. Either it is a legendary artifact, possibly from the demon world, or they have the same technology as the cult&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What if he&#8217;s a normal human being?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That is truly the pinnacle of martial arts. If it were real, I&#8217;d like to see it. In any case, it&#8217;s been hundreds of years since the Round Table has cooperated. You&#8217;ll find out what that means in due course——&#8221;</p>



<p>Fenrir let out a fearless smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8230; Then, as a newcomer, I will quietly follow. I, too, am a part of the plan.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make a mistake, Petos-kun.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fenrir-sama too. If the release of the right arm fails and the ruins fall into the hands of the Shadow Garden&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Petos stopped speaking and braced himself.</p>



<p>The dreadful magical power overflowed from Fenrir.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who are you talking to, Petos —— I&#8217;m Fenrir. I&#8217;ve been in the 5th seat of the Rounds for a long time. I&#8217;m proud of that. I will definitely release Diabolos&#8217; right arm.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;That&#8217;s Fenrir-sama that I know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We will resurrect the demon Diabolos and bring it to full life. For that, I won&#8217;t let anyone complain, no matter what steps we have to take. Even if this country collapses&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Results are everything. I am here to help you, Fenrir-sama.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have told you, I don&#8217;t need any help from you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a decision of the Round Table. Please use this artifact.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a vicious collar with needles that looked like clocks.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; This is?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It is the latest artifact developed in the cult&#8217;s laboratory. It seems that Fenrir-sama is having a hard time collecting magic power. I think it will be useful.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll use it when I feel like it. Still, I&#8217;m surprised you came all the way out here to use it. I wonder what kind of wind you are blowing &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was just following orders. I am a man loyal to the cult. I&#8217;d like to change the subject &#8230;&#8230; but I hear that a golden beastman visited these ruins.&#8221;</p>



<p>Petos asked, casually, as if making small talk.</p>



<p>But Fenrir sensed something in the tone of his voice and knew this was the main issue.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Golden Beastman, huh? I wonder&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course, the golden of Seven Shades remains in Fenrir&#8217;s memory.</p>



<p>But he&#8217;s not going to tell him nicely.</p>



<p>Fenrir&#8217;s gaze crossed with Petos&#8217;s.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you find one, please let me know.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was Petos who took his gaze off first.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you need something with that beastman?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s not worth talking about. If you&#8217;ll excuse me.&#8221;</p>



<p>With that, he disappeared into the fog at a quick pace.</p>



<p>&#8220;Golden Beastman&#8230;&#8230; Petos obtained the samples by annihilating the Golden Leopard tribe. That was his stepping stone to promotion to the Rounds. Could it be&#8230;&#8230; survivor of the Golden Leopard Tribe&#8221;</p>



<p>Ahead of his line of sight is a cylindrical device with about 60% of magic power accumulated. No matter the means, the word was given.</p>



<p>&#8220;This has turned out to be interesting.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fenrir bared his fangs and laughed.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>The kingdom of Oriana, destroyed by the Black Beast, was rapidly being rebuilt with the help of the Shadow Garden.</p>



<p>Alpha squinted as she watched the sunset from the royal castle.</p>



<p>&#8220;So——are you ready?&#8221;</p>



<p>She asks the girl behind her.</p>



<p>There was a beautiful girl there with honey-colored hair. She was Rose Oriana.</p>



<p>&#8220;Will I be forgiven?&#8221;</p>



<p>Rose said with shaken eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;You won&#8217;t be forgiven. Many of the people still hold a grudge against you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;As I thought, I&#8230;&#8230;can&#8217;t be a king. It will only bring chaos to this country.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In normal times, that might be true. But not now. If you know what this country is going to become, you know there is no other choice.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha looked back and turned her strict eyes to Rose.</p>



<p>&#8220;You know that the alliance between the Kingdom of Midgar and the Kingdom of Oriana has been broken. The Holy Church has officially declared the Kingdom of Oriana a heretic state. Oriana&#8217;s trade is severely restricted and will soon dry up. Eventually, the neighboring nations will be ordered to defeat the Kingdom of Oriana. I don&#8217;t know how many countries will move, but there&#8217;s nothing this country can do about it, because it doesn&#8217;t have a proper military force. It will be destroyed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Heretic Nation &#8230;&#8230; How did this happen?&#8221;</p>



<p>Rose clenched her fists and looked down.</p>



<p>&#8220;The cult is afraid. This country&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why do they fear this small country?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;They are frightened lambs. That&#8217;s why they&#8217;re afraid of the sunlight.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eternal life is a symbol of mankind&#8217;s desire. Those who have it in their hands fear more than anything else that it will be taken away from them. If they ruled the world and stood out in the open, there would always be someone who would try to take it away from them. That is why they hid. They chose to hide their eternal life so that it would never be taken away from them, and to rule the world from behind the scenes using the Holy Church. That is how they have feared the sunlight.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The frightened lambs&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But the hostility between the Kingdom of Oriana and the Diabolos cult has connected the front and back sides of the world. If the Kingdom of Oriana is left unchecked, the Diabolos cult will eventually be dragged out into the open. They are afraid of that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; So Shadow Garden takes advantage of that, doesn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Rose turned her stern gaze on Alpha.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. We use the Kingdom of Oriana. That&#8217;s why we helped you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;With the power of the Shadow Garden, you should be able to defeat the cult. Why did you make the Kingdom of Oriana involved?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Because then the Diabolos cult will not be destroyed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;People will die. Nations perish. But religions never perish. It does not end when we defeat the Diabolos cult. That is what religion is. As long as there are those who believe in it, it is eternal.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No way&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do not underestimate the cult. If you make enemies of the cult, the people will cut your back. The people who believe in the Holy Church, and even the priests, are mostly good citizens. The cult uses the Holy Church to incite the people to kill. No matter how powerful Shadow Garden is, it cannot kill all the followers of the Holy Church in the world. That is why we need the Kingdom of Oriana. To bring the evil entity called the Diabolos cult to the surface and break the relationship between the Holy Church and the Diabolos cult.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How do you cut them off?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let the Holy Church cut off the cult. What the people believe in is the Holy Church, not the Diabolos cult. By making it clear, the Diabolos cult will become the common enemy of the world. For that reason, we must win. The surrounding nations will eventually come to defeat the Kingdom of Oriana. There, we must win. We shall win and proclaim to the world. That the world&#8217;s enemy is the Diabolos cult.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s why you want me to be king.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We need a state to stand in our place on the front side to destroy the cult. The battle between the Kingdom of Oriana and the Holy Church is a proxy war between the Shadow Garden and the Diabolos cult. If you are ready to be king, we will support you from the shadows.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Will I be a good king?&#8221;</p>



<p>Rose looked down and squeezed the words out.</p>



<p>&#8220;You are not a king in times of peace, but a king in times of emergency. The qualities necessary for a king in times of peace are kindness, which endears you to your people and enriches your country. But in times of emergency, it is different. The quality needed for emergencies is strength. The strength to achieve your goals despite the pain, sacrifices, and resentment of your people——&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha looked at Rose with her beautiful eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Rose Oriana, you shall be a strong king.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Strong King &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Rose chewed on those words.</p>



<p>Repeating it in her mouth, but not out loud. And what came to mind was her own weakness.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am weak &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Only those who know weakness can become stronger.&#8221;</p>



<p>A single tear ran down Rose&#8217;s cheek.</p>



<p>&#8220;If there is anything I can do for the Kingdom of Oriana and the people Otou-sama left behind &#8230;&#8230; I will protect this country, no matter how much they may hate me. I &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Rose wiped her tears and looked up.</p>



<p>Then she pulled out a thin sword and placed it against her long honey-colored hair.</p>



<p>&#8220;I &#8230;&#8230; don&#8217;t want to end up weak.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, she pulls her thin sword.</p>



<p>Her cut honey-colored hair fluttered in the wind.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will be a strong king&#8221;</p>



<p>Rose&#8217;s hair had become shoulder-length.</p>



<p>&#8220;As long as you are prepared for that, I swear that Shadow Garden will never betray you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha smiled gently.</p>



<p>She then called the Number 664 and Number 665. They were both dressed in maid uniforms for some reason.</p>



<p>&#8220;Put these two at your side. The one you are familiar with would be better.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t have to be so formal. You and I are equals. You will be a strong king, won&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes&#8230;&#8230; Ah, yeah, I will be a strong king.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rose said, sounding unaccustomed to it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kusu&#8230;&#8230; Number 666-chan, you&#8217;re so cute.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s good to hear. If you had talked to me about it, we would have worked it out a lot quicker.&#8221;</p>



<p>Number 665 and Number 664 said so in a small voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, both of you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome~&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m your squad leader, so don&#8217;t forget that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Understood, Squad Leader.&#8221;</p>



<p>Rose gave them both a gentle smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll communicate future plans through Number 664 and Number 665, and you&#8217;ll need to provide them with a front registry and position. You still need to keep the connection between Shadow Garden and the Kingdom of Oriana under wraps.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You two will be hired as my maids. As soon as the family register is ready.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do that&#8230;&#8230;Looks like someone is here.&#8221;</p>



<p>At that moment, the door to the room opened and a girl with indigo hair entered.</p>



<p>It is the third seat of the Seven Shades, Gamma.</p>



<p>For some reason, Gamma was dragging a girl.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alpha-sama, are you here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, Gamma also came to the Kingdom of Oriana.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Considering the future, we have closed the Mitsugoshi Trading Company in the Kingdom of Oriana. As a replacement, we are doing the groundwork to enhance our Shadow Garden location.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gamma said, lowering her voice slightly.</p>



<p>&#8220;As expected of Gamma, I really appreciate you working so fast.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What about Princess Rose?&#8221;</p>



<p>Gamma looked at Rose with a sideways glance.</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8217;s prepared to walk with us.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha also looked at Rose and Rose said.</p>



<p>&#8220;I look forward to working with you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gamma responded to Rose&#8217;s greeting with a silent bow of her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alpha-sama. I have two reports, but would it be alright if I talk about them here?&#8221;</p>



<p>Gamma seemed concerned that Rose was here.</p>



<p>Rose sensed that she was not yet trusted.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll prepare another room——&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>



<p>Interrupting Rose&#8217;s words, Alpha replied.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you sure?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. I don&#8217;t mind.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, Alpha looked at Gamma and Rose.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t mind. What about you guys?</p>



<p>That is what Alpha is asking.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t mind either.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Me too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gamma and Rose replied.</p>



<p>&#8220;First of all, the equipment that Beta recovered in the Demon World the other day.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about &#8220;Notopasokon&#8221; and &#8220;Taburetto&#8221;.&#8221; <em>(TLN: Laptop and Tablet)</em></p>



<p>&#8220;I had Eta check everything. Eta, explain it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gamma said so and called out to the girl who had been dragged.</p>



<p>&#8220;Supii&#8221;</p>



<p>Cute sleeping breaths are escaping from the girl.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Eta, wake up!&#8221;</p>



<p>Gamma grabs Eta&#8217;s shoulders and shakes her violently.</p>



<p>Eta&#8217;s head, rocking back and forth, bumped against Gamma&#8217;s nose.</p>



<p>&#8220;Pegya!&#8221;</p>



<p>The impact woke Eta up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>She is Eta. She is the Seventh of Seven Shades and mainly focuses on the study of Shadow Wisdom.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Where is this?&#8221;</p>



<p>Eta looked around absentmindedly.</p>



<p>She was a small elf.</p>



<p>Her long, dark hair is bedraggled by her sleeping habits.</p>



<p>&#8220;C-Come on, tell Alpha-sama about <em>that thing</em>!&#8221;</p>



<p>Gamma says, holding her nose from bleeding.</p>



<p>&#8220;Report &#8230;&#8230;? Ah~, about notopasokon&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;R-Right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Etto, report!&#8221;</p>



<p>Eta looked at Alpha sleepily.</p>



<p>&#8220;Notopasokon and other things that use electricity, everything was broken. I disassembled it and examined it, probably due to the electromagnetic radiation when it crossed the gate.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it possible to fix it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;At the moment it&#8217;s impossible. But we&#8217;ll figure it out in time&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s so&#8230;&#8230;It can&#8217;t be helped, I guess we&#8217;ll just have to wait and see. That Beta, all she brings is things that run on electricity.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not so. The technology used is extremely high. Even if we can&#8217;t operate it, we can learn a lot of different technologies.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so? Well, that&#8217;s good. But Beta must have been depressed, right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She was wailing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that enough to make her cry?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No. She was depressed, so I mixed her tea with some pills to make her feel better.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; So?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Suddenly she took off her clothes and started crying. Cause unknown, interesting.&#8221;</p>



<p>Eta twisted the edges of her lips into a grin.</p>



<p>Alpha let out a big sigh.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Next month&#8217;s research funding will be drastically reduced.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, why!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I told you that you shouldn&#8217;t experiment on human subjects without permission. You should reflect on that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh~, sacrifices are always made in the development of the Shadow Wisdom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not &#8216;eh&#8217;. Then, report back when you find a technology that could be applied in this world.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eeh.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And there was one more <em>thing</em> that she brought back with her.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha&#8217;s eyes narrowed quickly.</p>



<p>&#8220;<em>Thing</em> &#8230;&#8230; Aa. That person from the otherworld has just woken up. I don&#8217;t understand her language, so now she talks to Beta. Her name is Akane.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Akane &#8230;&#8230; What else did you find out?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;I think her body is almost the same as a human&#8217;s. But I don&#8217;t know the details yet. If I&#8217;m allowed to experiment on humans, we&#8217;ll know soon enough.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Leave it to Beta until things calm down. Don&#8217;t do anything weird, absolutely.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yea~.&#8221;</p>



<p>Eta nodded reluctantly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand Eta&#8217;s report. So, what&#8217;s the second report?&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha spoke to Gamma.</p>



<p>&#8220;The second one is about Zeta in the Kingdom of Midgar. Has there been any report from Zeta?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No. Good grief&#8230;&#8230; She never reports back to me at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha let out another sigh.</p>



<p>&#8220;Before coming to the Kingdom of Oriana, I came to see how things are going, so I&#8217;ll report.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, Gamma.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Fenrir faction is on the move. They seem to be kidnapping students from Midgar Academy. Since we have recovered most of the demon possessions, they seem to be having a hard time unsealing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, what about Zeta?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230; She is not moving yet.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not moving?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Although she should have grasped the movement of the Fenrir faction.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That girl has a lot of selfishness in her behavior, but she is definitely talented. I wonder if something happened.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha said a little curiously.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Fenrir faction, though in decline, has long controlled the underworld of the Kingdom of Midgar. And Fenrir was one of the first Rounds. They should never be underestimated.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The credit collapse must have caused enough damage to the Fenrir faction. I thought there was little left in the way of strength and funds, but &#8230;&#8230; I wonder if that&#8217;s the underlying strength of the original first Rounds.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think someone should send support. I know there is Delta in the Kingdom of Midgar, but I don&#8217;t think those two can cooperate.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha said vaguely and looked at the scenery outside.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am busy preparing the base and Eta has her hands full with research. Beta has to deal with the person of the otherworld and paperwork &#8230;&#8230; Is Epsilon the one who&#8217;s free? There are a few other Numbers&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No need.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha said as she looked into the distance.</p>



<p>&#8220;But&#8230;&#8230; Is it okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. She will be fine. She has always been like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Gamma thought this was an optimistic view, which was not like Alpha.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have a bad feeling about this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I still remember the day I first met that girl. I had never seen such sad eyes, like she hated everything in the world. In order to heal her emotional wounds, I welcomed Zeta as a family&#8230;&#8230;She has changed.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha turns and looks at Gamma with her blue eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, it&#8217;s okay&#8230;&#8230;Because we&#8217;re family.&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha smiled. It was a gentle smile that encompassed everything.</p>
