<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 4: Ideals, Reality, and Rumors</b></h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 1</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I woke up at the usual time in the morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I changed my clothes, washed my face, and went downstairs. Then I noticed something strange.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was pitch black.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, since it’s 7 am in the early summer, there&#8217;s a little morning sunlight coming through the windows and curtains. It’s not pitch black in the literal sense.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, I turned on the lights in the dimly lit living room. Then, I opened all the windows leading to the garden and ventilated the air that had been trapped in there overnight.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncle is on duty and has not been home since yesterday. Right now, it’s just me and Hasumi-senpai in the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked up to the second floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looks like Hasumi-senpai is still sleeping.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I still feel bad that I haven’t been helping her with breakfast, so I decided to prepare it today. I’m planning on letting Hasumi-senpai sleep more and wake her up when it’s almost time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, I took out some vegetables from the refrigerator and made a salad. Then omelets.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai eats a relatively good amount of food in the morning. She does not skip breakfast or eat less in the morning. And yet, with her proportions like that, any girl in distress would be drowning in envy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, I’m sure she’ll be in a hurry this morning. So let’s add some bread and coffee to complete the breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, I heard a door open with vigor on the second floor.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shi, Shizuru!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s footsteps, hich sounded hurried, somehow made their way toward the other side.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru! Are you awake?!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You don’t always wake me up though. Why would she think that just because she overslept that I would too? She must be very confused.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she hurriedly came downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, Shizuru. I think the battery in my alarm clock ran out.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looks at the kitchen, then she suddenly stops.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, you made breakfast? You don’t have to, you could have woken me up.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I just thought, why not? Since it’s a time like this. By the way, why don’t you go ahead and change first?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She must have been in a real hurry. She probably jumped off her bed and immediately ran down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was still in her pajamas. The white silk was translucent, but she told me that she had checked it many times, so it shouldn&#8217;t be see-through, yet it was still poison to my eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I-I suppose…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems she only realized what she was wearing when I told her. She didn’t rush to fix her outfit but casually headed upstairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright―”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And I deliberately let out a sound.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai will be coming down soon, so let&#8217;s start toasting bread already.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry. This really helps.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About ten minutes later, we were eating breakfast facing each other at the dining room table. Hasumi-senpai apologized as she bit into a bread roll.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We can’t have the both of us be late after all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose. We don’t have much leeway, but there&#8217;s enough time to not be late.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the clock, it was no more than 20 or 30 minutes longer than when we usually eat breakfast. If we didn&#8217;t do anything unnecessary, we would probably make it to school on time without having to run.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But then again, Shizuru, you’re better than I expected.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai says in admiration while looking at the breakfast.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I have a similar family background as you, Hasumi-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In single-parent households, the children have to do the parts that the working parents cannot handle. It naturally happens.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I have time, I can make something more elaborate. I can at least turn this normal omelet into a Spanish omelet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Heh, that’s pretty good. I think I’ll leave it to you once in a while, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If possible, I’d like to do more than just cooking.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took the opportunity to express what I had always wanted to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel bad for making you do all the work after all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You really don’t have to worry about it though… Uh, what else? Meals, laundry, cleaning, and shopping…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai counts using her fingers.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can do all of them.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Then, I’ll leave it to you once in a while. Mainly to clean up after meals. I’m not good at it, but I like to cook.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are people like that. They’re good at cooking, but not good at, or dislike washing cooking utensils. [T/N: Just like me.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, it’s weird to say that I’m good at it, but I can do it without any difficulty.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can finally be of some help to the Hasumi family.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I’ll go on ahead.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As usual, I leave the house first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The only difference is that Hasumi-senpai is still upstairs, not in the living room. Time is pressing today. She’s probably getting ready for school in her room. I called out to her from downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s no response from Hasumi-senpai. Either she didn’t hear me or she’s not in a position where she can respond. It’s also possible that she replied but it didn’t reach me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I should get going. Even if I leave without telling her, she should not be that angry. With this in mind, I turned my body toward the front door.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, wait. I’m leaving too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door to Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s room opens. Hasumi-senpai looked ready as she came downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, we’re leaving together?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can’t be helped. If we go with our usual arrangement, I’ll be late.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s true, if she can’t catch the train that will be coming later, she’ll be late. If she’s one train late, she’ll either be late or have to run after getting off the train.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Come on, get going. Or do you want us siblings to be late?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai pushed towards the entrance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It can’t be helped. After we arrive at the station, we can just separate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I walked to the station along with Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just the other day, we walked to the station together when we went shopping in Sannomiya, but it’s a different feeling when we are both in uniform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, it’s strange. A month ago, I was just admiring Hasumi-senpai as a famous beautiful girl in the school, but now we are walking side by side as siblings. As they say, fact is stranger than fiction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, what do the neighbors think of me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I have been seen entering and leaving the Hasumi residence several times by residents in the neighborhood. They greeted me while appearing puzzled from my unfamiliar presence, and I returned their greetings, feeling a little apologetic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that? A child of a relative that’s being taken care of.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai probably hesitated to mention it. There should be a phrase that says, “that lost his mother.” there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Dad was also reluctant to tell the truth.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She chuckles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course he was. When asked for an explanation, he can’t just say that I’m his child born from a mistress.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Some people may ask you directly, Shizuru. So just reply with that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I understand.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the meantime, the Myodani station came into view. It was at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard a voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Naoi Kyouhei, the last person I wanted to see right now.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Hasumi-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi ran to us as we turned around and uttered his morning greeting. He was still carrying a large sports bag on his shoulder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning, Naoi-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And Makabe, morning.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning. Naoi, we run to each other often these days.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We met on the station platform on our way to school not long ago.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As he joined us, we walked toward the station again. With Hasumi-senpai in the center, Naoi and I walked on either side of her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, the finals are coming up, right? That’s why there’s less morning practice. Next week, it’s gonna be completely gone, and the next week after that, there will be no after-school practice.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. So it&#8217;s a system where practice is phased out in preparation for tests? It seems to be different from the library committee members.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So I’m on the edge because I’m not used to not having morning practice.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi chuckles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see that you two are together. Is it because you live close to each other?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, that’s right.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi responds to Naoi&#8217;s somewhat timid question in a casual tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru and I are actually siblings.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that casual tone, she told the truth, and I was more surprised than Naoi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t it fine? You don’t have to keep it secret from the people you’re close to. Although you can’t go around telling people.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai, is that true…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi asked more cautiously than before. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un, it’s true. We’re what you call half-siblings. I don’t have to tell you to understand what relationship my dad and his mother had, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I guess…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don’t tell anybody. I told you because it’s you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai charmingly told a story that was supposed to be dark, but Naoi weakly replied, “I understand…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After this, he was less talkative than usual.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 4: Ideals, Reality, and Rumors</b></h3>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 2</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi Kyouhei probably likes Hasumi Shion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">How would he feel if his classmate and the one he likes are siblings, and living under one roof? It’s no wonder he would not be at peace.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like things are getting quite bad.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I underestimated Hasumi-senpai’s openness. I guess she doesn’t want to lie as much as possible, especially to those close to her. As a result, her cute junior and my classmate, fortunately, or unfortunately, got involved.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai had no bad intentions. In fact, she even treated Naoi as someone to whom she could reveal her secrets. However, I’m sure Naoi didn’t take it nicely.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s now lunch break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I was in a hurry in the morning, of course I didn&#8217;t have a lunch box. To get lunch, I had no choice but to go to the school cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just right. I’ll try that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the class, I stood and quickly put away my textbooks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Naoi.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the liberating atmosphere of lunch break, everyone is beginning to move in their own way, some are spreading out their lunch boxes with their close classmates, and others hurrying to the cafeteria. I caught Naoi Kyouhei who was leaving with his group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When he turned around, his voice was clearly firmer than usual. There was no that fresh smile of his.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t have my lunch today. Can I come with you?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I refuse. Find someone else.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi&#8217;s response was almost immediate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His words were cold, an attitude far cry from his usual self. The members of the group and nearby classmates who heard it were startled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then he bit his lip slightly, seemingly also surprised himself.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My bad. I want to eat with my good friends. Maybe next time.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He turned on his feet and headed for the classroom doorway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He said that you and he are not necessarily close.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Izumikawa chuckled as if to insult me. He then went after Naoi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kyouhei, now that’s something you don’t see every day.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He has been in the same class with Naoi since the first grade and is also in the same club as him. His name is Murodo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, but give it up.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He said it condescendingly as if to pity me, and then he too followed Naoi out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Was my bad prediction right? Naoi seems to have mixed feelings about this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I went to the cafeteria too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s lonely to eat by myself, so I’ll ask someone to eat with me. Although not as much as Karube or Heshikiri-san, I’ll probably find someone I’m close to. That said, I don’t think they’re in the “good friends” category. It’s probably because of our good compatibility rather than friendship.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, here you are.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I went to the cafeteria, Hasumi-senpai was waiting for me at the entrance for some reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong? Did you forget your wallet?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s mouth twitches. Then she suppresses the tone of her voice andー</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not it. Because of me, we don’t have a lunch box, so I thought why not eat together?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t want to.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I ate here before with Takinami Ruika, but at that time she had a pretense of thanking the library committee member for helping her. However, on the surface, there’s no contact between me and Hasumi-senpai. If we eat together in public, people would pry into it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s more, Naoi is inside the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? You don’t want to eat with me that badly?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not it, but we can’t right now.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An unexpectedly strong tone of voice came out which surprised even me. It was just like Naoi&#8217;s earlier. I wonder if he was in this kind of mood.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Alright.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai let out a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I apologize. But for what? For refusing the invitation, or for speaking out loud?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai gently places her hands on my shoulders.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then,</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">She turned my body around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takinami-san, please take care of this for me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said and pushed me as hard as she could.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The direction was into Takinami Ruika’s figure. At this rate, we would collide. At that moment, I tried to hold on and almost lost my balance. Even so, I managed to kill the momentum and it became a “contact” rather than a “collision.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwahp…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyaa?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My face hit something soft. I rush to raise myself up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m sorry, Takinami-senpai. Ah, um…!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I’m fine. I was just a little surprised. It’s not like we collided into each other.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai replied with a red face and looked at Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, what’s wrong with you?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, Makabe-kun and I forgot to bring our lunch box. Takinami-san, I’m sorry but can you please eat with him?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you listen carefully, that sentence is a mess, but Takinami-senpai seemed to have guessed that there must be a reason for it, and she agreed with a sigh of dismay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai, Naoi is in there.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, really? Then, I’ll join themー”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying this, Hasumi-senpai disappeared into the cafeteria.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyu~dorodordoro~” [T/N: What?][E/N: </span><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;s basically making an SFX or something. Something like &#8220;Hm~ Hohoho&#8221; or something.]</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Takajou Miyabi who let out some mysterious sounds from her mouth.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She snuggled to my back and placed her hands and chin on my shoulders. Could this be the classic ghost imitation?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m from the public morals committee. I sensed a disturbance in public morals… How did Takanami-san’s b*****s feel?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder what you’re talking about? We didn’t bump into each other.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Public morals? Look who’s talking…</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“More than that, it’s bumping into me.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m making it so~”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Get away from him this instant!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai pulled Takajou-senpai away from me by force.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-san overslept?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few minutes later, Takinami and I were having a meal across from each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I explained why I didn&#8217;t bring my lunch, she widened her eyes in surprise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now that’s rare.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From my point of view as someone who lives with her, Hasumi-senpai is a punctual person. Every morning when I woke up, she had already prepared breakfast and was reading the newspaper in the living room. That impression I get from her is probably the same for everyone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It seems that she didn&#8217;t actually oversleep, but simply had a dead battery in her alarm, so this time it was more like an accident. “</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Then, I suppose that would be easier for you, Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Takinami-senpai changed the tone of her voice to a slightly more serious one.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what’s wrong? Did you get into a fight with Hasumi-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, that’s not really…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I bet. It didn’t look that way.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai asked me with her eyes, “Then, what is it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing happened between me and her directly. Since there are also some other people involved in this, I can’t tell, even to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have a tight lip, if I do say so myself… Alright, but let me know if something happens. I’ll hear you out.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you very much.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Having said that, it’s not the kind of thing I can ask for help from Takinami-senpai. This is a matter of Naoi’s emotions, so even if she knew, it’s not something that she can help solve.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Still, I would like to do something about it if possible. Because no one would want that kind of uncharacteristic attitude from Naoi Kyouhei. [E/N: I personally do not care. I guess that is why I will never be a protagonist]</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 3</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next day, Naoi was back to his usual self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At least it appeared that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He has a pleasant smile on his face, makes a lot of chatter with his group, and exchanges words with his classmates. This is how everyone wants Kyouhei Naoi to be. His cold behavior during yesterday&#8217;s lunch break was just like a lie.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But the only thing that stands out about his attitude is towards me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yes, I was trying to stay away from Naoi, and he was also consciously avoiding me. Perhaps that’s why Naoi is able to maintain his sanity.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe-kun, is something wrong?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During the morning break, Heshikiri Sakura asked me, who was watching Naoi with a sideways glance.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un? Ah, no, I was just thinking what kind of glasses suits you, Heshikiri-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heshikiri-san looked puzzled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you think, Karube?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;The rimless type.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His response was rather immediate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rimless, the type of glasses doesn’t obstruct the face. Surprisingly, Karube thinks that Heshikiri-san would be better off without her glasses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I like the under-rim type. The design looks stylish.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Wait, what are we talking about?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Heshikiri-san begins to fidget.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As I said at the beginning, we’re talking about frames that would look good on you, Heshikiri-san. You always wear Wellingtons, so I thought it might be nice to put on something different once in a while.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Geez, stop fooling around with someone else’s face.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re not fooling around. We’re being serious.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although her introverted personality and slumped posture hide it, Heshikiri-san has a well-defined profile. I think she could experiment with her choice of glasses more.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s no need to think about it seriously…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hashikiri-san said in a fading tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Karube. What do you think of Naoi these days?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to end Heshikiri&#8217;s remodeling plan for today. Then I asked Karube.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you think I’m interested in Naoi and his cronies?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I bet not.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a curt reply, typical of Karube, who hates irrationality.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Naoi has been consciously trying not to pay attention to you since yesterday morning. You started acting weird during lunch break. You’re being careful to stay out of Naoi&#8217;s sight as much as possible.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unbelievable, how terrifying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So you do care about it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I do not. Since he’s acting differently than usual, it just entered my line of sight.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These are the people who observe people as they breathe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Heshikiri-san cuts in.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, really? I thought he was being the same as usual, I didn’t notice it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I casually looked at Karube.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t see any particular change either. Is this because I’m not observant enough, or is it because there’s really no change at all?</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">§§</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s now lunch break.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Five minutes before it, to be exact.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The fourth period on this particular day of the week was Asaba-sensei’s math class, and during the first class of the first semester, he said to us. “I&#8217;m going to finish this class five minutes early. Happy, right? But I won&#8217;t change the pace of the class.” Since then, this class has ended five minutes earlier than usual in exchange for the high density of the lessons.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The benefits are unexpectedly great. I’m released early from my morning classes and can eat lunch earlier because of it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There’s probably some favoritism toward this class. But perhaps he also calculated it. He knows that the students are losing concentration because they want the fourth-period class to end early, so it’s a measure against that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Asaba Seijuro is not to be underestimated. I believe that his disheveled shirt and beard, as well as his moderately loose and carefree attitude, are all calculated to catch you off guard.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amidst the noise of the five minutes early lunch break, Asaba-sensei called me over.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, yes.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied once and started walking toward the podium. The teacher came a little closer to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry, but I need you to open the library during this lunch break. A teacher from 12th grade asked me for a favor. He wants his students to use the library to do research for a class project.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it can be after you eat your lunch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then Asaba-sensei left the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, today I started eating my lunch quickly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I went to the staff room to borrow the key, the teacher said, &#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. It’s your lunch break and all.&#8221; The teacher thanked me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just because it&#8217;s lunchtime doesn&#8217;t mean there’s anything in particular to do. If you look at the grounds and courtyard, you will see some students playing with a ball, but I was not that active.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took the key and went to the library. Fortunately, there were no third-year students waiting to use the library. I guessed that they did not want to spend the whole lunch break doing schoolwork, as I did not specify the time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I go inside and turn on the lights.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I’m a member of the library committee, there’s a possibility that some may borrow books from the library. So I also turned on the terminal at the counter where the reading system is installed and the terminal for searching the library collection in the reading area.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was getting ready.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I immediately recognized the voice who seemed to be probing if there was anyone present.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, standing in the doorway was, as expected, Takinami Ruika and her group. She, Takajou-senpai, and three others, a total of five people.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you the students who wanted to use the library?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai nods with a smile.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wanted to research something for a group assignment, and the first thing that popped into my head was your face, Makabe-kun.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. There are only a few who use the library. It’s an impossible thought for anyone other than the students who often come here to use the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank goodness for Takinami-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Takajou Miyabi-senpai who said so in a calm tone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;d like it if you would thank me for being here. I’ll be doing things as usual, so you can use it as you like. You can also borrow books.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami senpai thanked me on behalf of the others, and the girls headed toward the reading table. First, they placed the notebooks and writing utensils they had brought on the table, then went to the stacks.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat at the counter as usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai is the kind of person who has no idea what she&#8217;s doing here, but she has a fair amount of knowledge about how to search for books and about the order of books. There probably won&#8217;t be a situation where I would be needed or asked for help.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I have no helping hands, I will do my usual work for the time being. The first thing I did was make a list of overdue books, books that were due yesterday but have not been returned yet.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Makabe-kun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was working like that, Takajou-senpai came up to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you open this place for me during lunch if I ask?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, this time is just special. I usually don’t do it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Normally, the library should be open during lunch break as well. However, this is only possible if there are enough members of the library committee who are on duty, so the school can’t ask me to do all that since I’m alone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps they asked me this time because it was a request from a 12th-grade student who is preparing for an entrance examination.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. What a shame.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it more convenient to keep it open?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there’s a request, you have to raise it to my advisor, not just to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, I just thought it would be a good place to take my selfies.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pardon?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My eyes suddenly widened.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I posted a selfie with the library in the background, people would say, &#8216;You’re dressed like that in the library?! What the h**l?! I&#8217;m sure it would be filled with comments like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you thinking?! Please don’t use the library for that kind of thing.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I heard that she usually takes selfies with the uniforms of foreign schools she ordered, but if she does that in this library, she would be identified by her school uniform. No, this person would be passionate enough to prepare uniforms for selfies, how terrifying.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you can work that out, I&#8217;ll let you have one picture as thanks.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t need that kind of thing.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Takajou-san, what are you doing?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kyaah”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai was already standing behind Takajou-senpai before she knew it. She was standing with her arms crossed, and Takajou-senpai let out a small scream.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I hope you&#8217;re not asking Makabe-kun anything strange again.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shame. I already asked to be his cheating partner before and he said no, so I’ve given up.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C-Cheating partner?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai exclaims.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What were you offering him?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh? So you don’t deny that you’re the legal wife?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“M-Me and Makabe-kun are not like that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai responded with her face bright red.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">About ten minutes before the end of the lunch break, they finished their research and I was able to close the library.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now I am walking down the hallway with Takinami-senpai and her group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s not that we are going to return the key to the staff room together, but simply our destination is in the same direction.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Naoi-kun!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we were walking along, one of the seniors spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, Naoi was coming toward us, accompanied by Izumikawa and his usual group.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Naoi-kun, good afternoon.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good afternoon, seniors.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">The two groups, each led by Takinami Ruika and Naoi Kyouhei, are no strangers to each other, having eaten together once before in the cafeteria. They stop and greet each other in a friendly manner.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also called out to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With some kind of hope.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi looked at me. But there was only a look of hostility which was unlike him. Stop. Don’t make that face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, my wishes were in vain, and Naoi ignored me and started walking again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, Naoi-kun…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the seniors called Naoi, as if she wanted to greet and talk to him. But he did not stop.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had hoped that the disturbance of Naoi&#8217;s mind due to jealousy would only be transient, but it seems that was not the case.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn&#8217;t Naoi-kun look really angry just now?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un, that was really unlike him…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/FzSy1gC/00020.jpg" alt="00020" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The seniors are blinking their eyes. Seeing Naoi Kyouhei, who was usually </span><span style="font-weight: 400">always smiling refreshingly</span><span style="font-weight: 400">. With an attitude like that, it’s only natural that they would react in that way.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The seniors looked at each other and then at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, you’re in the same class, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They wanted to know the reason for Naoi&#8217;s attitude. The seniors all looked as if they wanted to ask something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As you guessed. I was the one who made Naoi angry. I got angry because he was always trying to act cool, so I lunged at him and was met with a good beating.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought for a moment, then shrugged my shoulders and said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course that will happen.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And I wouldn&#8217;t say he’s acting cool. He’s actually really cool.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As a result, they ganged up on me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The nameless seniors started to walk. I walked slowly so that the distance between us would gradually widen.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then two seniors lined up with me.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not impressed with such sloppy solutions.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takajou-senpai calmly said, and Takinami-senpai said nothing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was with Takinami Ruika on my way home that day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was waiting for me at the school gate, even though I didn&#8217;t show up at the library after school. And when she saw me, she did not smile, but silently joined me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She walks beside me with a look as if she wants to say something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let me ask you this first, has my reputation as a kind librarian been lost?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, not at all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai shook her head.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not even talked about.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I bet. That’s how it is.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is the best I can do at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m surprisingly selfish, you see. And I impose my ideals of what I want on people.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I used to think that Hasumi Shion got angry when she was angry, and when she got angry, that was the end of it. I wanted her to be that kind of girl.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just like now. I hope Naoi Kyouhei will be as fresh as the blue sky. It’s fine if he’s going to look at me with hostility, but he should do that while others are not looking which would result in his reputation lowering..</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that also true for me?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course. I want someone named Takinami Ruika to be beautiful, intelligent, kind to everyone, and ladylike.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s the ideal Takinami Ruika that everyone desires.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She has a two-sided face, and I want her to only show her true side to me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai fell silent.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after a while, “Geez,” was the only thing she said.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you so desire, Shizuru. I can be a bit of a dirty girl, you know?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s something I&#8217;ve always wanted to get fixed.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I responded without a pause.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 4</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The next morning.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I got up as usual, got changed, and headed to the bathroom. But when I got there, it was occupied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was washing her face at the sink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I greeted her, she raised her hand as if to gesture, “Wait a second.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, Hasumi-senpai finishes washing her face, reaches for her towel, and wipes her face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm. Morning.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it was delayed, she replied.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai looks really refreshed. I hope I don&#8217;t look too bad considering I just woke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s easier today since Dad is present.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think so too.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s right, Uncle is here this morning. More precisely, he was not on duty yesterday and came home at a decent hour, so Uncle is making breakfast. That meant Hasumi-senpai was able to get a lot of sleep.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps reflecting this situation, this morning, she’s wearing wide pants and a T-shirt. Without Uncle around, her outfit would be a lot more revealing, like wearing only shorts and a tank top.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I washed my face after Hasumi-senpai was done. Once I finished washing my face and reached for the towel, the towel came to my hand. Naturally, Hasumi-senpai was the one who gave it to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thanked her and wiped my face. I had assumed that Hasumi-senpai had gone downstairs first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh right, Hasumi-senpai. Can I get my lunch earlier today?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Uncle may be making the breakfast, but Hasumi-senpai is still responsible for lunch boxes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t mind. What, are you leaving early?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. I’ve got some business to attend to.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hm, alright.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai agreed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then we went down the stairs together. In the living room on the first floor, Hasumi-san is reading a newspaper. Neither of them probably noticed, but they looked very much alike when they bend forward to read the newspaper, which was spread out so that it covered the low table.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Morning, Dad.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Hasumi-senpai and I called out to him, Uncle looked up.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, you came down together, huh? Morning.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems like he was happy that the siblings came down together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was probably waiting for me for this moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">*** </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After finishing breakfast and getting ready for school, I left the house as soon as my lunch was ready.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left about fifteen minutes earlier than usual.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I took the train at Myodani Station and got off at Gakuen Toshi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">High school students that are commuting tend to peak at the very last minute of the morning, so there were hardly any students wearing the same uniform.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s why she stands out so much.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takinami-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be fine to silently walk behind her, but if she were to accidentally find me at the entrance, I don&#8217;t know what kind of complaints she would make.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Makabe-kun. Good morning.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I lined up alongside her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re quite early.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just a coincidence. I left earlier than usual and got on another train that was earlier than I thought.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see. She was two steps ahead.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Also, Takinami Ruika cannot be late.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She whispered, adding those words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess It&#8217;s hard work to meet the expectations of those around you.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is this your usual time, Makabe-kun? If that&#8217;s the case, maybe I&#8217;ll start going to school around this time every day from tomorrow onwards.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Unfortunately, I’m early today.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And yet, we met. It must be fate, don’t you think?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai giggles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Please don&#8217;t bring up fate from this small thing. There are stories in the world about fifteen people who were late to church for different reasons and escaped an explosion. Well, it might have been a miracle at that point, considering the destination they were headed to. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">(E/N: https://medium.com/the-mystery-box/how-15-mundane-miracles-saved-15-lives-from-an-explosion-4e111669f3a6)</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perhaps you always go with Hasumi-san?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai asks again, keeping her voice down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way. I can’t do something that frightening. Oh right. There&#8217;s something I want you to hear.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My, what is it? A confession?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. It&#8217;s a serious topic.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that in advance, I cut to the chase.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hasumi-senpai told someone that we’re siblings. The person is her junior from the same middle school.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay… you say?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami&#8217;s response was so simple that I was at a loss for words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s the problem?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve told you before. It’s laughable that I&#8217;m the younger brother of Hasumi-senpai. I’m just an ordinary guy.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I said this, Takinami-senpai let out a sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, your evaluation of yourself is too low.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she says in dismay.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First, it’s not uncommon for the older to be excellent and the younger to be average. And of course, vice versa. Rather, It&#8217;s a lot rarer to find siblings who are both beautiful or handsome and outstanding.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Second, you’re not as average as you think you are, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“We’re kindred spirits.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai stated it clearly and without hesitation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No one will ever know what those values are based on.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I agree. Then, let’s look at the obvious―you’re the sole member of the library committee.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I just sit there.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But many students can’t do just that. Some of them have part-time jobs, some go to prep school for exams, and some of them don&#8217;t see the value in service work that doesn&#8217;t compete with anyone or set records. It’s not something anybody can just do. Have a little more confidence in yourself.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai spun her words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And most importantly, you’ve been acknowledged by none other than me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay, that’s big.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied with a wry smile.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shortly after I entered the classroom, Naoi entered the room.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I had arrived at the school with less time to spare as I did the other day, it would have been meaningless for me to come early, but as expected, I did not repeat the same blunder.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Naoi saw me, he quickly averted his gaze. It was not as if he turned away because he did not want to see me, but rather as if he was unable to look at me due to guilt.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of that little incident, Naoi, who usually always appear with a brisk good morning &#8211; he now missed the timing and entered the classroom in silence. His attitude caused several classmates to tilt their heads.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Members of his group who had already arrived at school came up to him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also approached Naoi.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Naoi, I need to talk to you.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I cut to the chase, but he didn&#8217;t answer right away. He’s probably confused. He doesn&#8217;t know how to face me. So he silently prepares for first-period class.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kyouhei-kun doesn&#8217;t want to talk to you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Izumikawa who answered instead. He was angry from the start, not smiling like the other day. He was like his guardian.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aside from that―I feel sorry for him, but that language is not well-mannered and a bad move.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s go outside.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi finally spoke up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Because of Izumikawa, he couldn’t say, “There’s nothing to talk about.” and so he had so choice but to accompany me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We went out into the hallway.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, in the midst of the sparse students, Naoi and I confronted each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At any rate, I managed to get to this situation, but now I wonder how I should cut to the subject. Surprisingly, there were many forbidden words.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I know what you’re trying to say, Makabe.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was searching for the right words, Naoi spoke up first.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re calling out my bad attitude, right?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I guess, for the most part, that’s the issue. It would be so if it were stripped down to its simplest form.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But whose fault is it?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you trying to say it&#8217;s me?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah! You lied to me, Makabe. You said you just lived close to that person! But that’s not the case!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi raised his voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the first time I had seen him like this. A first coming from the fresh, calm, yet charismatic guy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I looked around quickly with just my eyes. Several students passed by while paying attention to us. Some were from my class, some from the next class, and some from the class on the other side. Even inside our classroom, there were some who were looking at us, wondering what was going on outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When we were talking about that person, were you laughing inwardly, Makabe? Or were you feeling superior?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No. I couldn’t say it. It involves our parents after all.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Hasumi-senpai had decided, maybe she was fine telling Naoi. Of course, I would have had to choose my words carefully so as not to disturb him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On the day, you came back to school. You jokingly told us that you and that person were siblings. That was you looking for a reaction from your surroundings, right? You wanted to see how I would react?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I never thought that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wanted Naoi to understand, so I also unknowingly put a lot of strength into my voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi and I exchanged glances.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;So you&#8217;re mad at me, Naoi? Because I lied.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a silence, I open my mouth first. I ask with a clear voice, checking for confirmation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi bit his lip once.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, after stating his answer, he, in a rough manner, got back into the classroom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but murmur to his back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s just self-deception, Naoi…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The emotion that Naoi feels towards me is definitely jealousy. Jealousy that I can be unconditionally by the side of the woman he admires so much. If he thought about it calmly, there was no way that we could be anything more than siblings, since Hasumi-senpai and I are still related, albeit half-siblings. But Naoi couldn’t think rationally. The fact that I’m with her 24/7 in a place he doesn’t know is enough for him to be jealous.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And yet, he replaced his reason for his anger to being lied to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a way, he&#8217;s just like me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you don&#8217;t face your feelings, nothing will begin.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But on the other hand, I envy him. The way he admires someone and loses control of himself because of it is something I don&#8217;t have at the moment.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In any case―negotiations broke down.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I found this troubling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Naoi is smart, so he must be aware that he’s taking his anger out on me. But I couldn’t point that out. To do so, I would have to mention that Naoi has feelings for Hasumi-senpai, and I don&#8217;t think anyone would want to hear such realization from someone else.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is an emotional issue.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are more shackles than one can imagine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">***</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At lunchtime that day, a rumor quietly began to circulate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quote, “Makabe Shizuru is stalking Takinami Ruika.”</span></p>
