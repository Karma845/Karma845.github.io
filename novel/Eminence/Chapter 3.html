<h2 style="text-align: center"><b>Chapter 3: Searching For Such Future</b></h2>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 1</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sunday.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The time was a little before ten o’clock.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, did I make you wait? Let’s go.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I was sitting down on the sofa watching TV and idly waiting, Hasumi-senpai came downstairs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was wearing denim shorts, a thick belt, and a top with a wide collar that exposed her collar bone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, is something wrong…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I was checking her attire, Hasumi-senpai anxiously questioned me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, nothing. It suits you very well.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-Is that so? I hope so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her mouth twitched as her cheeks reddened. Then she turned her body towards Hasumi-san’s study as if to avoid making eye contact with me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, Dad, we’ll get going. Just eat whatever at lunch.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright. Take care, both of you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From inside the study, I could hear Uncle’s muffled voice. He has been holed up in his study since breakfast because he apparently has something to research. His voice sounds strangely serious for a man who’s sending his daughter off to play, and judging from the fact that he’s not showing his face, he must be concentrating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it really alright? Not preparing something?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">I asked as I headed for the entrance with Hasumi-senpai. I didn&#8217;t think we would really leave him alone and have him eat whatever at lunch.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s alright. I think he&#8217;s probably just doing a lot of research because he&#8217;s not sure of what to do with his patients. After lunch, he&#8217;ll probably go out for some junk food at the station, or have some instant noodles at home.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai replied as she took out a pair of high-cut sneakers from the shoe box at the entrance. It looks surprisingly sturdy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He actually likes that sort of thing. I’m sure he’ll be humming as he eats his food. Maybe because he doesn&#8217;t get a chance to do that very often.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s true that Hasumi-senpai makes proper breakfast and dinner, and he also takes a lunch box for work. He’s on duty rather frequently, but then again, he may be eating properly at the hospital cafeteria.</span></p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/x5PsSSt/00017.jpg" alt="00017" border="0"></a>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We left the house.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, we walked to the Myodani Station and went through the ticket gate using our IC cards. We went down to the platform and boarded the train that arrived a short while later. The train was moderately crowded for a train going to Sannomiya on a Sunday before noon, so it looks like we won’t be able to sit. We stood side by side holding the strap.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We usually go to school at different times, so it’s refreshing to ride the same train like this.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Gufu.</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I instantly choked up when I remembered something I shouldn’t have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Come to think of it, there was a time when we rode the train together.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What’s wrong?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Noticing my unusual behavior, Hasumi-senpai asked.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I just remembered that time when I rode the train with you, Hasumi-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Bufu</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time Hasumi-senpai choked up.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why would you bother mentioning that?! Can’t you just shut up about it?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It may be because we’re inside a train. She showed a technique of yelling in a whisper, and I apologized. A middle-aged man sitting in the seat in front of us looked up at us curiously.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, why Sannomiya?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To change the subject, I asked a question at the right time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, Sannomiya wouldn’t go wrong, but it’s not that we don’t have any other options, for example, Harborland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No reason really. I figured we should go to Sannomiya for now.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s answer was really concise. It was so simple and curt that when thinking about it, it seemed like there must be an underlying reason for it. Well, I don&#8217;t think she would answer me even if I asked her again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eighteen minutes from Myodani to Sannomiya. After talking about whatever came to mind or caught my eye at random, we soon arrived at our designated station.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We got off the train and exited the station through the east ticket gate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first thing I did was to take a look around.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then I soon found her. At the stairs and escalator leading to the private railway, a girl in skinny jeans and a shoulder-length blouse. ―It&#8217;s Takinami Ruika.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I knew it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What’s more, she’s wearing sunglasses, maybe a disguise? Was it because of the daily exchanges that I managed to recognize her despite that, or was it because of her overwhelming aura as a celebrity? Or would anyone who knew her, even by a little, recognize her?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai glanced in our direction while pretending to operate her smartphone.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought the exchange at the back of the library had calmed her down a bit, but it seems like she couldn&#8217;t sit still at home. I let out a small sigh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next to me, Hasumi-senpai was hysterically laughing and saying, &#8220;Ahahaha, she&#8217;s here!&#8221; What a mean personality, but I can&#8217;t let her be like this any longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ll go get her. Had enough?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I guess so. At that time, I also thought that I was doing something gloomy and boring. I can’t let Takinami-san do the same.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai gave a self-deprecating laugh.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai had followed us before after being agitated by Takinami-senpai. This time it was payback, but it would be short-lived. Hasumi-senpai herself knows that this is a stupid thing to do.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thanked Hasumi-senpai and went towards Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Takinami-senpai noticed me approaching her, she began to visibly flinch, but she eventually just surrendered.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takinami-senpai, what are you doing here?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I questioned her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she shifted her sunglasses down and began to observe me from top to bottom.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-Did you know…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She said something similar to Hasumi-senpai the other day.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai and Takinami-senpai, are they both not aware that they’re attracting attention just by standing? Besides, she was blatantly gathering information, so of course I would be on alert.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a deep sigh.</span></p>
<p style="text-align: center">
<strong>§§§</strong></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, we need to fill our stomachs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With another person coming along, we went to the restaurant area in the basement of the Center Plaza building.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was just before twelve o&#8217;clock. All the restaurants seemed to be getting crowded, and we entered a restaurant specializing in curry, which still had some seats left. Hasumi-senpai and I sat facing each other, and Takinami-senpai sat down next to me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Takinami-san, what brings you here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When we finished ordering, Hasumi-senpai asked Takinami-senpai. What an ill-natured question. Well, I did it too.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No-Nothing really. It’s just a coincidence.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai&#8217;s excuse is truly painful to hear.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On the other hand, you two are having a date as planned?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wouldn’t call it a date.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai glares at Takinami-senpai with half-lidded eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s just siblings going out shopping.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To a stranger, it doesn’t look that way.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I guess it would probably only look like a poor junior getting dragged by his overbearing senior and getting forced to go shopping with her.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’re still saying that?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now her fierce glare is targeting me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shrugged my shoulders and she snorted dismissively.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t care what others think.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she said something like that as she drank her drink.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, how confident. It’s the opposite of me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, Takinami-san, your true face is quite intense. I thought you were more ladylike.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I entered the school, I rarely saw them interacting with each other. Both are celebrities in Akanedai High School, but I guess they’re not at odds with each other, nor did they interact with each other in a particular way. I heard that they’ve never been in the same class before. At most, they exchanged contact info for greetings, that’s why Hasumi-senpai did not know Takinami-senpai&#8217;s true face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose. I’m the opposite of you, Hasumi-san. I know what people expect from me, so I respond accordingly. Takinami Ruika is a beautiful, smart, and refined lady. That’s what they expect out of me, so here I am.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So she calls herself beautiful.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai laughs.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, hearing it sounds really tough. How many athletes or teams have actually set records, won medals, set new records, or become candidates for medals at the world championships when told that they are expected to? People around always have high expectations without knowing it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Appearance is something you are born with. But academics and the way we present ourselves require effort. She has met the expectations of those around her without complaint.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is how the current Takinami Ruika was formed. I wonder how many people know her true face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don’t hate it. Having two-faced or being confident.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? I’m glad.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai smiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But, I’m not giving you Shizuru, understand?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s not about giving or not!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai raised her voice in irritation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai showed her true colors to Hasumi-senpai, and she accepted it positively. However, it looks like they won’t stop fighting.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Excuse me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, an appropriate number of eating utensils was brought by a deep tray.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We will have your order ready for you shortly.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, the waitress lightly bows and steps back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon after, our order was delivered, just as said it would be.</span></p>


<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 2</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a lunch that took an hour, we went outside.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are several department stores around Sannomiya and Motomachi. HANKYU, Daimaru, and Kobe MARUI. After visiting those, we entered a store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Glasses?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai tilts her head in confusion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’ve never seen Shizuru wear one. Then, is it for Hasumi-san?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right. I only use it when reading or studying.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai replied, looking at the frame she was holding.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She chose this store because of its wide variety of frames, many of which were fashionable and aimed at the younger generation.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You see, Shizuru told me that if I’m going to wear one, I should pick one that suits me. I think I’m fine with the one I have, and Shizuru told me it looks great on me. But, I thought it might be nice to pick one seriously.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai quickly said while looking at the frames in order, appearing somewhat hesitant.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I had to describe her situation right now, she’s currently feeling embarrassed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai called out to me in a small voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel like you have a real chance with Hasumi-san.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Stop. Don’t say something unnecessary.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s going to be hard to live with her from now on. Who do you think I am living under one roof with? She’s one of the most beautiful girls in Akanedai High School.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Shizuru.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-Yes?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai suddenly turned this way, so I involuntarily straightened my back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There’s too many. Which one do you think is good?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s up to you to decide. But alright, I’ll explain. That said, it’s only knowledge I learned from magazines.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked a frame up while speaking.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“First, this is a Wellington glasses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These are the most standard frames, and the most recognizable. They go with almost any outfit, in other words, you can’t go wrong with these. My classmate Heshikiri Sakura also has several pairs of glasses, but all of them are all this type.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And this is a Square glasses. The same one you use, Hasumi-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I point to the particular frame.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Square-shaped glasses give a different impression depending on the thickness and color of the frames. Thin frames give an intellectual impression, while thick frames give a playful image.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It would be interesting to have several of these square-type glasses in different combinations of frame thickness and color, but as one would expect, there are probably not many enthusiasts out there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This one is a Brow glasses. I wouldn’t recommend it to you, Hasumi-senpai, since this makes you look sharp.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry for having a rigid face.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai said self-deprecatingly while smiling.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn&#8217;t mean to say it like that. Hasumi-senpai is bright and expressive, so it balances and makes up for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Under rim glasses.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s the type of glasses with frames only on the lower half. Since it gives a gentle image, I think it will suit Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s friendly personality better, not in the sense that it will change her image, but that it will make her personality stand out even more.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And lastly, rimless glasses.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the name implies, there are no frames, making them sleek and clear, and they are for people who don’t want to change the impression of their faces. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’d say that’s about it.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I conclude my talk after having exhausted all the knowledge I have.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You really know a lot, huh?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As I said before, I just got interested and looked it up.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This knowledge is useless. No, it’s useful right now. You really never know when this sort of knowledge will come in handy.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai went back to selecting frames again.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Shizuru?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, Takinami-senpai suddenly called me.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un?…?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned around and saw that she was wearing squared-type glasses.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was astonished by her fresh look.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How do I look? Does it look good?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai innocently smiled.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t reply immediately.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh? No way. It doesn’t suit me?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;No, it suits you very well.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a second, I thought it was embarrassing to honestly admit it. But, Takinami-senpai was getting impatient, so I decided to put it into words properly.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it looks good. It gives an intelligent look. The slender frame is stylish, and your expression is soft, so you don’t look too serious.&#8221;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She’s usually ladylike, and when she’s alone with me, she has a childish attitude. But when she wears glasses like this, she instantly looks more intelligent. Maybe this is how she looks in class. It’s something I would never see since I’m not her classmate.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Somehow, it feels embarrassing when you praise me that much, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai giggles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I’m sorry for not giving you praise often.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, I get it. You want to be seduced by an intelligent older woman like this or something?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I never said that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Dammit. I&#8217;ve been trying to be a little more honest about my feelings for her, and this happens. I shouldn&#8217;t do something I&#8217;m not used to.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, you lovebirds. Can you stop flirting in the store?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, we suddenly heard Hasumi-senpai’s voice. She was staring at us with stern eyes.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We looked around in surprise. It was a reasonably spacious store, and everyone was either concentrating on choosing frames or consulting with each other, so it seemed that only Hasumi-senpai could hear us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai appeared to be in a bad mood and poked me with her elbow.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So I’m the one to blame?</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 3</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We left the optical store.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, she didn&#8217;t buy anything.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you blame me? I’m not really sure what to choose since there are so many. Besides, Shizuru told me that the one I currently have suited me, so I thought it would be fine not to buy anything right now.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai seemed a bit apologetic, probably because she didn&#8217;t buy anything even though we accompanied her. On the other hand, she seemed happy because of what she said at the end.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What a terrible thing to do. Shizuru, what kind of compliment did you give her?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean terrible?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">What a terrible thing to say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Hasumi-senpai, she probably receives all kinds of compliments on a regular basis. However, the fact that she was complimented for her glasses left a strong impression on her.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So what are we going to do?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Today&#8217;s objective has been fulfilled, or rather, postponed.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let’s see. I’d like to wander around a bit more.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Said Hasumi-senpai. Takinami-senpai said nothing. She probably thinks that because she followed us on her own, she has no position to decide what to do. To begin with, it’s because my half-sister agitated her, so I don’t think she needs to worry about such things.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai looked at me, asking for my opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please go ahead. I’m just a pitiful junior, so I’ll follow you anywhere.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I jokingly say.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then the two seniors looked at each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What is he saying?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He probably doesn’t understand what he just said.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, un…?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like they’re saying something disturbing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Hasumi-senpai and Takinami-senpai looked at me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As I said before, you should be responsible for your words.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A man doesn’t go back on his words, right?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They both had wonderful smiles on their faces.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s not that I don’t want to accompany them on the women’s fashion floor. I just find it boring.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nah, I can live with being bored. But aside from that, it’s also incredibly frustrating.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We’re now in Kobe MARUI.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two girls browsed the fashion floor, and I followed behind them. It would be so much easier if I’m just following them. But sometimes they ask for my opinion.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say, Shizuru. Which one do you think is better?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai holds up two different shirts for me to see and asks me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;The right.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it? I think the left also looks great, you see.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, she brushed off my opinion and compared the two with a difficult look on her face.</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, Shizuru, what do you think about this?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now it’s Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I think it’s great.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That doesn’t sound genuine. Do you really think so? Girls won’t be pleased if you talk like that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She turns away while scolding me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Repeating this exchange several times, you will understand. There’s no meaning or right answer to their question. It naturally would kill my vibe.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai suddenly noticed something. She put back the item she was holding and started to move. Ahead of her was Hasumi-senpai. She silently approached from behind, erasing her presence. The sight looked like a shark targeting its prey.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh my, Hasumi-san, are you going to buy that?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai was so surprised that she jumped when she was suddenly approached and threw back the top she was holding in her hand.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wasn’t that a piece that had its back open? Showing off your back in summer? How bold.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-n-n-no, it’s not like that!”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, Hasumi-senpai seems to be in a panic.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I didn’t see it, but in summer, an open-back design wouldn&#8217;t be that crazy. I&#8217;m sure it would look good on Hasumi-senpai, and I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s something she would be teased for or feel embarrassed about when choosing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hasumi-senpai noticed me behind Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shi-Shizuru, you’re here?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I am. Since I was told by a tyrant senior to accompany her.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh….”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I responded, her words got stuck.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C-Come on, let’s go.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then she forcefully dropped the story.</span></p>
<ul>
<li style="list-style-type: none">
<ul>
<li><span style="font-weight: 400">§§</span></li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Later, I was sitting on a bench.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my line of sight were Takinami-senpai and Hasumi-senpai having a lot of fun together. Looking at them like this, they do not appear to be on bad terms with each other.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They’re in a swimwear store for the summer season. The glamorous atmosphere there was like some kind of barrier against men, and I didn&#8217;t feel like entering the store at all.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The swimsuit I bought last year is already tight.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a moment. What kind of bizarre phenomenon is that?! And why did you try it on?! Ah! Don’t tell me you took a bath with Shizuru―”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-no, that’s not it! That’s not why I tried it on!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them looked at the items and went deeper and deeper, like small animals lured by food. If possible, can they just go straight to the depths of the abyss?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You’ve got a pretty good status, huh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pfft.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A voice jumping unexpectedly into my ears made me gush out.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning around and looking up, I saw Mibu Kanata standing there in a blouse and ripped jeans. How elusive&#8230;</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ka-Kanata-senpai, why are you here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I stood up without a second thought.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn’t there only one thing a woman would do in here?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I guess so…”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That was a stupid question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And besides, even if you didn’t follow me, my plans wouldn’t have changed.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s true that I was originally supposed to accompany Kanata-senpai today. However, Hasumi-senpai forced me to make plans with her, so I couldn&#8217;t go with her. Still, Kanata-senpai went shopping on her own.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you find something good?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No luck. I’m not cut out for this.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai then chuckled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For the record, I can’t do it today.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know. You’re not skillful enough to handle three people.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That&#8217;s right. Frankly speaking, Hasumi-senpai and Takinami-senpai alone are enough.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the front, I saw the two still choosing swimsuits. Takinami-senpai shoved one into Hasumi-senpai and she hurriedly returned it to its original place. She seemed to be complaining. I bet Takinami-senpai chose a flashy swimsuit because she thought it would be funny.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wouldn’t last long just by myself.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Phrasing! What are you talking about?!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai is so unnerving since she’s the type of person to say something ridiculous without batting an eye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I wonder? Wouldn’t it be quicker to ask your own chest than others?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;..”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, let’s stop talking about our chests.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That said, you look like you’re having a lot of fun.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does it look that way to you?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As you can see, I could not keep up with the two girls, so I took refuge here. I’m like a father who brought his children to an amusement park but got exhausted first and slumped on a bench. There’s nothing fun about it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I turned my attention back to the two without any reason.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“From a woman you dumped, it does.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I didn’t dump you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Why does she express her words in such a way that would make someone misunderstand it?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can’t make you look like that.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I also enjoy your company, Kanata-senpai.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I replied without a pause.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It’s true that most of the time, when she’s going to invite me, our exchange would be like, &#8220;You should follow me,&#8221; followed by, &#8220;Yes, with pleasure,&#8221; but I’ve never unwillingly accompanied her. I’ve been going with her happily. I can say that with confidence, and I do not want her to misunderstand that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It seems like there’s one thing genuine.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Genuine.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, they are not made up, but feelings that arise naturally from within the self.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Checking it one by one is also one way.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It sounds like a daunting task.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eventually, you’ll realize it’s all for naught.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanata-senpai turned on her feet without warning. It seems that she’s going home. She must have given up on the idea of being able to choose her own clothes. Naturally, there was no goodbye.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I watched Kanata-sensei&#8217;s back as she left.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When a person is working on something and feels it’s a waste of time, oftentimes it’s because the results stay the same for a long time. Now, what about my case?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shizuru, hey!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that they just missed Kanata-senpai and I heard a voice calling from inside the barrier.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Shizuru, what do you think about this?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I went there, Takinami-senpai asked me that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both of them have the swimsuits of their choice. Both are bikinis. It was hard to look directly at them when they shoved them into my face.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I first looked at Takinami-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> </span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why ask me?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400"><br/>
</span><span style="font-weight: 400">“It’s your girlfriend’s swimsuit, you know? Of course, you’re not going to be the only person who would see it, so I’m asking if it’s ok or not to wear it, you being my boyfriend and all.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I mean, we’re not even lovers in the first place, so why don’t you just do whatever?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, I looked at Hasumi-senpai.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought you didn&#8217;t want me to pick for you.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give an opinion at least.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I’ve been through a lot because of that opinion though?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, if it’s just that.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">They probably won’t respect it anyway, but let’s just say it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking again, Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s pick was of a fresh blue border pattern. Meanwhile, Takinami-senpai&#8217;s pick was decorated with a hibiscus pattern.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sure Shizuru is imagining us wearing it right now.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, stop it! You’re suddenly making me embarrassed!”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai said a few unnecessary words, and Hasumi-senpai quickly hid her swimsuit behind her back.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I decided to leave for now. If these two are going to get excited on their own, I won’t be needed. Also, if a man stays inside the barrier for too long, he will die.</span></p>

<h3 style="text-align: center">Act 4</h3>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Afterwards, at Hasumi-senpai&#8217;s request, we had ice cream at the same store as the other day―the time was a little past 4:00 pm.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, Hasumi-senpai said something.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m sorry Takinami-san, but can you take care of Shizuru for me? I suddenly have to go home right now.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Takinami-senpai who raised her voice.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was also surprised. I wonder if Uncle contacted her without me knowing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really? Thank you, then take care of the rest.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For some reason, even though Takinami-senpai didn’t respond, Hasumi-senpai just continued.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That’s when I finally realized. No wonder this situation looked familiar, it was when I had a date with Takinami-senpai. At that time, she also forcefully pushed me toward Hasumi-senpai. She’s doing the same thing.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In other words, Hasumi-senpai returned everything that was done to her at that time.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you want to do?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai asked me.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if we go after her now, she’ll just shove us away.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I suppose.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She giggled.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shall we have a short date, then?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">~~~</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That said, it was already evening. There are only a few things we can do at this hour, so we decided to ride the Ferris Wheel at Harborland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We took a train from Sannomiya to Harborland.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Arriving at our destination, we didn’t wait that long for our turn to ride, maybe because of the time. The sun had already set and there was no point in seeing a night view.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We boarded the gondola and sat facing each other. We will be in the air for the next ten minutes. As the altitude escalated, we were gradually able to see the whole city of Kobe. At the mountain range is Mt. Rokko, and at the seaside is the Akashi Kaikyo Bridge.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is Hasumi-san being considerate of us?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gondola had just begun to ascend. Takinami-senpai seemed uninterested in the scenery, so she asked me a question. Perhaps she didn&#8217;t care about the scenery at all and chose the Ferris wheel simply as a place where she could talk with me at ease.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Probably.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She agitated her, and in the end, she left the two of us alone. In the case of Hasumi-senpai, she knows that Takinami-senpai usually tries to get my attention, and she also knows that I have feelings for her. That&#8217;s why she was being considerate of us.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So she has a positive trait, huh?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai giggles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, what should we do after this?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go to a cafe and have a cup of tea and head home is the safe bet.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you want to get home at a sensible time, that&#8217;s all we have time for.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What about the option of not going home?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I clearly stated.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whether or not we have that option, Hasumi-senpai will be there when I get home. How can I face her in case of that?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before all that, the hurdle is too high to inform her that I won’t be going home today.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The gondola slowly gains altitude. The view is quite nice. I’ve ridden this Ferris wheel a few times before. When I was a child, it was with my mother. In middle school and high school, I rode it with friends. But riding alone with a girl is a first. What’s more, this first is with a beauty who’s a celebrity at school. I wonder if the past me could even imagine this?</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, am I beside you, Shizuru?”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami Ruika suddenly looked straight at me and asked a question.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think you’re sitting across from me though.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s not it.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I knew. It’s about what I said when we were looking up at the bamboo.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai didn’t rephrase her words to ask me again. She silently waits for my answer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I think so.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? I’m glad. After all, my </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">self</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> is also beside you, Shizuru.”</span><span style="font-weight: 400"></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Takinami-senpai happily smiles.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even if it’s a bit too much to not go back home. Can I expect a future where we would be kissing, going on dates, and cuddling?”</span></p>
