<h2>Chapter 3: Case Closed, Yes, Let&#8217;s Talk About the Old Days</h2>

<p>Well, last night was a very serious incident.</p>



<p>The culprit in the serial disappearances was, to my surprise, the head librarian of the school.</p>



<p>I witnessed the head librarian kidnapping nee-san and Alexia and tying them up in a mysterious fog. What a bad hobby.</p>



<p>He was a pervert——.</p>



<p>However, he could not stop himself from committing the crime even though he was conflicted about himself as a pervert.</p>



<p>Each person has their own purpose in life. But when that purpose is rejected by society, one must make a choice.</p>



<p>Do you go through with it or do you kill yourself?</p>



<p>I was the former and he was also the former.</p>



<p>The fact that the culprit in a series of disappearances is a pervert is not very &#8220;Eminence in Shadow,&#8221; but, well, it&#8217;s the truth, so it can&#8217;t be helped.</p>



<p>People from the Knights come and go at the school in the morning. It is probably an investigation of the head librarian&#8217;s case.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? That is&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>There was a dark-haired female student who was stumbling around, looking down, as she passed the Knights.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s nee-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>It would be a trouble to be found, so I would normally hide, but that doesn&#8217;t seem to be necessary.</p>



<p>By the looks of her, she won&#8217;t even notice me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuhn fuhn fuhn ~&#8221;</p>



<p>I hummed random tunes as I basked in the pleasant morning light.</p>



<p>I am a student mob you can find everywhere.</p>



<p>What should my reaction be when I find out what happened to the head librarian? Should I be exaggeratedly surprised like a mob, or should I tremble in fear &#8230;&#8230;?</p>



<p>While thinking about this, I passed nee-san.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait.&#8221;</p>



<p>At that moment, I was grabbed by the neck.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yaa, nee-san, did you notice me?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I turned around, there was nee-san staring at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. Anything else you want to say?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;G-Good morning?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good morning, Sid. Anything else?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing else &#8230;&#8230; though.&#8221;</p>



<p>I thought for a moment and said so. I couldn&#8217;t think of anything to talk to nee-san about.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m depressed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He~e.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was slumping my shoulders and looking listless.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aa~.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re my little brother, you should have something to say to your big sister who&#8217;s feeling down.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hm~m.&#8221;</p>



<p>I thought about it for three seconds.</p>



<p>&#8220;You don&#8217;t look well. What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; You just barely passed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So I barely passed?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Be more worried. And even guess at what&#8217;s going on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s ridiculous.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, you seem to want to know, so I&#8217;ll tell you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I never said I wanted to know&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;——You want to know, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I seriously want to know!&#8221;</p>



<p>I answered while being strangled by nee-san.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s too noisy in here, so let&#8217;s change places.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Etto, what about class?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;School&#8217;s cancelled for the day.&#8221;</p>



<p>She said and looked back at the school building.</p>



<p>&#8220;The head librarian is dead.&#8221;</p>



<p>She muttered in a meaningful way. I decided to be surprised like a mob.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>I was elegantly drinking milk tea in the gorgeous drawing room.</p>



<p>It seems that this is a special reception room that only celebrities are allowed to enter. It is a mystery why nee-san, a rural noble is allowed in.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I can&#8217;t give you the details. I don&#8217;t want to involve you&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Nee-san said with a serious face.</p>



<p>&#8220;But the Knights are trying to keep the truth about the Head Librarian in the dark &#8230;&#8230; and there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it. That&#8217;s what frustrates me&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The truth about the head librarian, huh&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course, they will try to hide the truth that the head librarian is a pervert. For the sake of the head librarian&#8217;s honor, I am in favor of the Knights&#8217; idea.</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s always better to be right.&#8221;</p>



<p>I muttered.</p>



<p>&#8220;You mean I&#8217;m wrong!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Nee-san glared at me with a scary look.</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t say that. Just &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just?&#8221;</p>



<p>I sense from nee-san a strong intention that if I say random things, I won&#8217;t simply get away with it.</p>



<p>&#8220;The darkness of the world is always deep. And not everyone can accept the depth of that darkness.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; You mean, if it was made public, it would confuse people?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Probably.&#8221;</p>



<p>The female students who used the library would be very hurt and confused.</p>



<p>&#8220;But that doesn&#8217;t mean the truth should be kept in the dark!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. That&#8217;s why we need someone to solve the case behind the scenes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Solving the cases in the shadow&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Even if the truth is kept in the dark, it doesn&#8217;t end there.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8230;That means I&#8217;ll just have to solve it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it doesn&#8217;t have to be nee-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A person who can move freely while knowing the truth &#8230;&#8230; I knew I was chosen.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nee-san clutched the bandage on her right hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, nee-san wasn&#8217;t chosen.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid, I am the only one who can protect you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I can protect myself.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I got it. You don&#8217;t want me to worry.&#8221;</p>



<p><em>CRACK CRACK</em>, I was hugged by nee-san.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to go protect Midgar Academy, this country, and you, Sid.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to let it end like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>I sipped my milk tea while nee-san hugged me.</p>



<p>The milk tea was delicious after all.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>The school was closed today, so when I returned to the dormitory, Hyoro and Jaga rushed in.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s a very disturbing case. The head librarian was murdered.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right. Maybe it really is the work of that organization.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s getting to the point where it&#8217;s not funny anymore.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Everyone seemed so serious.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hyoro and Jaga were relaxing, drinking Mitsugoshi&#8217;s finest coffee as if they owned the place.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s my room.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shouldn&#8217;t you do the special assignment?&#8221;</p>



<p>I say, putting pressure on them to leave quickly.</p>



<p>&#8220;We can do it later. We have plenty of time now that the school is closed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s right. If we are too occupied with our assignments that we can&#8217;t chew on our little happiness, we&#8217;re finished.&#8221;</p>



<p>Slurp, they sip their coffee.</p>



<p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t mean you can&#8217;t come to my room&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a premium coffee made by Mitsugoshi in Sid&#8217;s room, right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There are also some premium sweets made by Mitsugoshi&#8221;</p>



<p>Jaga rummages through a drawer without permission and opens a package of chocolates.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s mine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it fine? We are friends, aren&#8217;t we.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And frankly, I don&#8217;t think your allowance could buy it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve always thought it was weird.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a suddenly serious look on their faces, Hyoro and Jaga turned around.</p>



<p>&#8220;T-That&#8217;s&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed.</p>



<p>A cup of Mitsugoshi&#8217;s high-grade coffee costs more than 2,000 zeny. It is strange that it is always available in my room as a poor nobleman.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just that Gamma sent a lot of them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sid, you. You&#8217;re in debt, right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s so, please say so quickly.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, no, no, what do you mean by debt?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I mean this, it is the flyer I found in your room.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, Hyoro showed me a single flyer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mitsugoshi Bank&#8217;s New Service &#8220;Mitsugoshi Revolving Payments&#8221;, please tell me if you have the best debt like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mi, Mitsugoshi Revolving Payments&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>I had a bad feeling about this and read the flyer, which described a service that looked just like the revolving payments of my previous life.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, I told Gamma about the revolving payments.</p>



<p>&#8220;B-By any chance did you also borrow, Hyoro, Jaga?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. I borrowed two million zeny right away.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I borrowed a million zeny. All I have to do is pay back a fixed 20,000 zeny every month!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>They are finished, I thought.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter, Sid-kun? You look like you&#8217;ve guessed something.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What is the interest rate of Mitsugoshi Revolving Payments?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The interest rate was 2% a month, I think.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The annual interest rate is 24%. That&#8217;s cheap for a moneylender in the royal capital.&#8221;</p>



<p>I looked at them with distant eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;You borrowed one million zeny and paid back 20,000 zeny every month, and the interest rate is 24% per year, no mistake right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right, what&#8217;s wrong with that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you calculate when the repayment will end?&#8221;</p>



<p>Since the annual interest rate of 1 million zeny is 24%, interest of 240,000 zeny will be charged in one year.</p>



<p>And since the repayment per month is 20,000 zeny, that&#8217;s 240,000 zeny per year.</p>



<p>One year&#8217;s interest is 240,000 zeny and one year&#8217;s repayment is also 240,000 zeny.</p>



<p>In other words, they just keep paying interest and the repayment will never end.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who knows, it&#8217;s about five years, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t bother doing the math. You only have to pay back 20,000 zeny every month.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mitsugoshi Company is really reasonable to save us the trouble of doing the math.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I think you should raise the repayment amount a little more.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What are you talking about? Mitsugoshi said 20,000 zeny is fine, so don&#8217;t bother returning more.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. Rumor has it that some students have borrowed 10 million zeny. If you are a nobleman, it seems that even students can borrow easily. If your family has assets, you can borrow money.&#8221;</p>



<p>I looked up to heaven.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s get started, shall we?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You know we borrowed the money, so you understand the rest, right.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, the two took out the playing card.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Poker, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What, are you scared?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We will not allow you to run away with the win. We have plenty of money in the war chest.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nope.&#8221;</p>



<p>I let out a deep breath.</p>



<p>&#8220;——Double push.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then we piled the wads of bills high on the table.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>&#8220;Damn it, remember this!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-This can&#8217;t be right&#8230; Y-You are cheating! No mistake!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Hyoro and Jaga screaming.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, it&#8217;s already night, so be quiet.&#8221;</p>



<p>I grabbed them both by the neck and threw them down the hallway.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait! Play the game one last time!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not satisfied! We can&#8217;t end the day on a losing note!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I have no use for people who don&#8217;t have money. Good luck with your repayments.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a slam, I forcefully closed the door and locked it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why &#8230;&#8230; after all that cheating practice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Impossible. Are you saying that everything has failed?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How is that possible?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But that&#8217;s the least I can say&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Damn. I&#8217;ll borrow again at Mitsugoshi.&#8221;</p>



<p>I hear voices whispering on the other side of the door.</p>



<p>Of course, I destroyed all the cheating. And if the other party comes at me with cheating, I have the right to cheat back.</p>



<p>I gathered up the stack of bills on the table and smiled.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hyoro and Jaga are my new piggy bank. Thank you Mitsugoshi revolving payment.&#8221;</p>



<p>Money flows from Mitsugoshi Bank to Hyoro and Jaga, and I collect it.</p>



<p>This is the survival of the fittest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuhn fuhn fu~hn.&#8221;</p>



<p>Humming a random tune, I put a wad of bills into the military fund box.</p>



<p>I call out to the other side of the window.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry to keep you waiting, Zeta. You can come in.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then, without a sound, a golden-haired beastwoman appeared.</p>



<p>&#8220;Happy Birthday, Master&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? Ah, I see. I turned sixteen.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I realized it, the date seemed to have changed. Today is my birthday.</p>



<p>&#8220;Happy birthday&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;m not really happy about it.</p>



<p>In this way, one year of the planned 600-year lifespan is reduced.</p>



<p>How short life is, even though I haven&#8217;t reached the height yet as &#8220;The Eminence in Shadow&#8221;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Does Master hate birthdays?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t like it. Because the time I have left in my life is decreasing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know, that feeling.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta loosened up and let out a small laugh. It was a natural smile, unusual for her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Life is too short to achieve our goals.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn. I understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>She also agreed.</p>



<p>Then she looks at me with a serious face.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve come here tonight mainly because I have something important to tell you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fumu.&#8221;</p>



<p>Are you talking about money?</p>



<p>Zeta has taken care of me, so I might be willing to lend her a thousand zeny or so.</p>



<p>&#8220;Master wants &#8220;eternal life&#8221;, right&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course.&#8221;</p>



<p>I answered immediately.</p>



<p>With eternal life, when people forget about me a hundred years from now, I will appear again, and &#8216;Don&#8217;t tell me, he is that legendary&#8217; &#8230;&#8230; I can play that as many times as I want. As long as I live, I can reset &#8220;The Eminence in Shadow&#8221; play forever.</p>



<p>I plan to live six hundred years with my magic power, but it is still not enough to enjoy life.</p>



<p>I want to live forever as I am. Ah~, God, please create a system to buy the lives of those who don&#8217;t want to live long.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know how Master feels.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umu.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So that&#8217;s why I was making the move.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umu?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you remember the day we first met?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umu.&#8221;</p>



<p>I think it was a rainy day.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was a cold, snowy day.&#8221;</p>



<p>So it was a snowy day.</p>



<p>&#8220;I got demon-possession and learned about the ugliness of people.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umu.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And I was thinking. Of the people who have trapped us. Of this stupid world.&#8221;</p>



<p>She said and made a cold look.</p>



<p>From the first time I met Zeta, she does this eye at a random moments. This is pretty cool, and I have secretly imitated it myself.</p>



<p>&#8220;People repeat their mistakes. Over and over again, without ever getting tired of it, and the world remains foolish and unchanged.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umu.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought it was okay to die. Even if I died, the world would be no different. If I lived, the world would still be the same. But when I met Master, I realized I had something to do——&#8221;</p>



<p>Then Zeta began to tell an old story.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>She was born into a prestigious tribe among the beastmen.</p>



<p>Golden Leopard Tribe.</p>



<p>It is said that even the king of the beastmen showed respect at the mention of this name.</p>



<p>The Golden Leopard tribe has many tribes and she is the eldest daughter born to a family that has been the chief for generations. She was named Lilim there.</p>



<p>Lilim&#8217;s excellence was outstanding even at an early age, and she was carefully nurtured so that it would be better to leave her at home than to give her away as a bride.</p>



<p>The chief imported books for her and gave her an advanced education. This was unusual even for the relatively intelligent Golden Leopard tribe.</p>



<p>She, too, loved books and looked forward to eventually using her knowledge to benefit her family.</p>



<p>In this way, Lilim grew up straight while being loved by his clan.</p>



<p>It was around the time she turned twelve that the anomaly appeared.</p>



<p>She had what looked like a black bruise on her belly. At first, it was small and did not bother her. But it gradually spread, and Lilim became concerned and consulted her mother.</p>



<p>Her mother paled.</p>



<p>Then, without saying a word, she called her father.</p>



<p>The face of the father who appeared was also pale.</p>



<p>At this point, Lilim realized that this was not just an ordinary thing.</p>



<p>He checked Lilim&#8217;s stomach and said, trying to keep his voice down.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s demon possession.&#8221;</p>



<p>Demon possession. Lilim racked her brain.</p>



<p>She knew it by knowledge. Lilim, who had read numerous books, was also confident that he knew more than the rest of the clan.</p>



<p>But she couldn&#8217;t make the connection between that knowledge and the black bruise on her belly.</p>



<p>Demon possession.</p>



<p>Again and again, she ponders.</p>



<p>And Lilim naturally shed tears.</p>



<p>She was smart.</p>



<p>As she accepted the reality of the situation, she also guessed what would happen to her in the future.</p>



<p>Demon possession is a filth. The filth must be purified before it spreads. That is the clan code.</p>



<p>The problem was that a filth was born, especially in the prestigious Golden Leopard tribe, and that too in the clan chief&#8217;s family lineage. This is not just a problem for herself. It would be a big problem that would shake the clan.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou-sama, burn me at the stake.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim said so, wiping away tears.</p>



<p>&#8220;But&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The bruise on the belly is not very large. The stain is still small. If you burn me now, you can save our house. The clan will be convinced.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou-sama, please. It is for the good of the house. And also for my little brother.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim looked at the baby in his mother&#8217;s arms. He was born only six months ago and would be the heir to this family.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please &#8230;&#8230; Please, please.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim bowed her head and pleaded.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I won&#8217;t do it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou-sama!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No! It was in an elven book. That there was a way to cure demonic possession.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You can&#8217;t trust that!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was written that there is also a miracle medicine that cures demonic possession.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying that, her father began to dig through the books.</p>



<p>To Lilim, his back looked much smaller than usual.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is the matter? Tou-sama, be strong. Do not put your trust in such things. Please say something, Kaa-sama.&#8221;</p>



<p>But her mother kept her face down and said nothing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Here. It&#8217;s written right here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou-sama! That&#8217;s enou——&#8221;</p>



<p>After saying that much, Lilim&#8217;s words stopped.</p>



<p>A drop of water fell on the book her father held out to her. For the first time, Lilim saw her father&#8217;s tears.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou-sama&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll definitely find it. So trust your father and wait.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou-sama&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Her father&#8217;s warm arms embraced her.</p>



<p>Her mother joined them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou-sama&#8230;&#8230;Kaa-sama&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Tears that had been held back began to well up in Lilim&#8217;s eyes.</p>



<p>The next day, her father set out on a journey.</p>



<p>Her mother bandaged Lilim&#8217;s belly and said.</p>



<p>&#8220;He said he&#8217;ll be back in a month. You&#8217;ll be laid up with an injury until then. You must never go outside.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, Kaa-sama.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll take care of the house.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her mother smiled softly.</p>



<p>Touching the bandage her mother had wrapped around her, Lilim smiled, too. She felt that it would turn out well.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>

<p>Then, a month later.</p>



<p>In the middle of the night Lilim was woken up.</p>



<p>There is a lot of noise outside. Her father might have come home. Lilim was taken outside by her mother.</p>



<p>Her father was there.</p>



<p>He was tied with a rope and knelt.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou&#8230;&#8230;sama?&#8221;</p>



<p>Numerous torches surrounded her father. Blood stains were smeared on her father&#8217;s clothes.</p>



<p>&#8220;You guys, what do you mean by this?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her mother said in a courageous voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems the filth has come out of the clan.&#8221;</p>



<p>Stepping forward from the group of torches was a man who was the leader of a branch of the Golden Leopard tribe.</p>



<p>&#8220;Filth must be cleansed immediately. That is the law.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Her mother stood in front of her without a word.</p>



<p>&#8220;Where is the filth? Answer me.&#8221;</p>



<p>A man from a branch of the family put his sword to her father&#8217;s shoulder.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her father said in a hoarse voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>The man from a branch of the family thrust his sword into his father&#8217;s shoulder.</p>



<p>Blood spurted out and the sound of bones shattering could be heard.</p>



<p>Her father did not raise his voice. He kept his face down and didn&#8217;t move an inch.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s boring.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, the man from the branch family thrust his sword again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Stop! To swing a sword at a chief, do you think it will be forgiv——&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I will be forgiven. I am the new head of the Golden Leopard clan. This man betrayed his clan.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No way, what proof do you have&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A priest of the Holy Church came to our village and told us. He said he smelled demon possession. He said that in the East, the Holy Church gathers demon possessed people and cleanses the filth.&#8221;</p>



<p>A new man stepped out of the group. The man was dressed in priestly garb and had a thin smile on his face.</p>



<p>&#8220;The filth must be purified immediately. If left unchecked, the filth will spread throughout the village and lead to destruction——&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Lie.&#8221;</p>



<p>The priest&#8217;s words were interrupted by a hushed father&#8217;s voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you say something, beastman?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I said it&#8217;s a lie, human.&#8221;</p>



<p>The father met the priest&#8217;s scornful gaze head on.</p>



<p>&#8220;What do you mean ‘lie’?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;All of it. Demonic possession, etc., is all Holy Church bullshit.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You say interesting things. I think you&#8217;ve finally lost your mind.&#8221;</p>



<p>A man from a branch of the family mocked her father.</p>



<p>A sneer escaped from those around him as he was caught. Neither Lilim nor Lilim&#8217;s mother could understand what her father was saying.</p>



<p>But only the priest and the father stared at each other without averting their gaze the whole time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you have any evidence, Beastman?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The Golden Leopard is a tribe with a long-standing tradition. The chief of the tribe has a tale of heroism passed down to him. It&#8217;s the heroic tale of a beastman, one of the three heroes who fought against the demon Diabolos.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A fairy tale, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, it is a fairy tale. However, it is a little different from the fairy tales of the world. The three heroes are not men but women, demon possession is not a curse but a blessing, and so on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That statement would be blasphemy against the Holy Church.&#8221;</p>



<p>The priest&#8217;s gaze sharpened.</p>



<p>&#8220;I had always wondered. The fairy tales of the world and the fairy tales of the golden leopard tribe. Why are they so different.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nonsense. Fairy tales, they fade with time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that right? It is a tale of heroism that has been passed down from generation to generation only to the chiefs of the tribe. It should not fade away so easily. Above all, we are the Golden Leopard Tribe. We are the descendants of Lili, one of the three heroes who defeated the demon Diabolos, the hero of the Golden Leopard tribe. That is the answer.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; that means?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The heroic tales passed down to the golden leopard tribe are the truth. The Holy Church has twisted that truth.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her father said so with unclouded eyes.</p>



<p>Silence enveloped the area for a while.</p>



<p>Eventually, small laughter became contagious and became loud laughter that echoed throughout the village.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kuhahaha, funny, it&#8217;s funny! I haven&#8217;t laughed this hard in a long time!!&#8221;</p>



<p>A man from the branch house was holding his belly and laughing.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is interesting&#8221;</p>



<p>The priest was also laughing. But his eyes were never smiling.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see, I see, so this is what it means. That demon possession is a Holy Church nonsense, and that they are really the offspring of heroes. So there is no need to purify the filth. Is that what you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>The man from the branch family said with a laugh.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be kidding!!&#8221;</p>



<p>An angry shout echoed through the air.</p>



<p>&#8220;You want to endanger the whole clan with your stupid fantasies?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You may not believe it. But this is the truth&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t talk nonsense——!&#8221;</p>



<p>The fist of the branch family man hit her father on the cheek. Again and again, he hit him.</p>



<p>Lilim couldn&#8217;t move. Her knees were shaking and she just stood there cowering.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well. The sideshow is over.&#8221;</p>



<p>Wiping his reddened fist, the man from the branch family said so.</p>



<p>&#8220;Where&#8217;s the filth?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Her father had a small smile on the edge of his lips.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you don&#8217;t tell me, I&#8217;ll burn you all together.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even if I told you, it would be the same. You just want to torture me.&#8221;</p>



<p>The man from the branch family was silent. That was the answer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I&#8217;ll give you what you want.&#8221;</p>



<p>A man from the branch house draws his sword.</p>



<p>&#8220;S&#8230;&#8230;Stop!&#8221;</p>



<p>Everyone&#8217;s gaze gathered on Lilim.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-It&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s m&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim&#8217;s knees trembled.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I have&#8230;&#8230; d-demonic poss&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim squeezes out a pathetic voice.</p>



<p>Tears blur her vision.</p>



<p>In the midst of it all, her eyes met her father&#8217;s, who was staring straight.</p>



<p>&#8220;Listen.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her father&#8217;s voice was ever so gentle.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Golden Leopards are descendants of Lili, the hero who once saved the world. We are a family of proud blood. Why did Lili give us this tale of heroism? Why has she passed it down from generation to generation? There is a reason. We have a mission.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou-sama&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You have the blood of a hero thicker than any of us. You are strong and wise, and I am proud of you. Lilim, go to the east. There is a cure for demonic possession in the Kingdom of Midgar. There lies our mission.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-Tou-sama&#8230;&#8230;I am&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know Lilim can do it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying that, her father looked at her mother.</p>



<p>&#8220;I leave two of them to you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her mother gave a small nod and pulled Lilim into her arms.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you think I&#8217;ll let you go?&#8221;</p>



<p>The area was already surrounded by beastman men.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to make them escape. Even if it costs me my life&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>There is a creaking sound, as if something is creaking.</p>



<p>It was coming from her father&#8217;s body. Something was pulsing inside her father&#8217;s body.</p>



<p>The next moment, the father&#8217;s restraints burst open and an enormous amount of magical power overflowed.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What&#8217;s that power!?&#8221;</p>



<p>The man of the branch house shouts.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Golden Leopard tribe has a thick beast&#8217;s blood. I manipulated that blood and released it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her father&#8217;s golden hair was growing.</p>



<p>It was like a mane, as if it were going from man to beast and back again.</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No way. Such a story&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This technique, handed down only to the chiefs, is a forbidden technique that will reduce their lives.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her father cried tears of blood.</p>



<p>His muscles wriggle.</p>



<p>Blood vessels pop and spurt blood.</p>



<p>&#8220;GoaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Then he became a raging beast and blew up the beastman&#8217;s surroundings.</p>



<p>The father stands in the way to protect Lilim and the others.</p>



<p>&#8220;Go! Run!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou-sama, come with us!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim is astonished when he looks back at her father&#8217;s face.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Her father&#8217;s face had become a half-beast.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will eventually become a beast. Before that happens&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N&#8230;&#8230;No! Tou-sama!&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim extends her hand to her father&#8217;s back. But she couldn&#8217;t reach him.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an interesting power. I never thought I&#8217;d find a descendant of <em>that</em> in a place like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>The priest swung the red-black chain down and interrupted.</p>



<p>&#8220;GaaaAAAAAAA!!&#8221;</p>



<p>The father&#8217;s right arm flicked the chain.</p>



<p>The spiked weight at the end of the chain popped off.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a tremendous&#8230;&#8230; The collection of demonic possession is going to be an unexpected harvest.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Go, Lilim! Run!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Her father and the priest clash.</p>



<p>In that split second, the mother grabbed Lilim and started running.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou-sama&#8230;&#8230; No, NoOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!&#8221;</p>



<p>The last time Lilim saw her father&#8217;s back was very large.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>


<p>The mother, with Lilim in her arms, was running fast through the deep forest.</p>



<p>No footsteps. Her mother is a master of stealth.</p>



<p>However, the signs of pursuers are gradually approaching.</p>



<p>Some of the Golden Leopards have a special nose. They are joining their pursuers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s split up.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her mother stopped in front of the river and set Lilim down. The forest at night was cold and snow was flickering.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mother proceed southeast along the river. Lilim, go eastward over the river.&#8221;</p>



<p>The mother said so, and left the little brother on her back with Lilim.</p>



<p>&#8220;I asked for my brother, Lilim.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No&#8230;! Let&#8217;s go together, Kaa-sama!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t be selfish. It will only take a little patience. We will meet up in the Kingdom of Midgar.&#8221;</p>



<p>The mother hugged Lilim tightly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then why do you entrust my brother to me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Lilim&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t fight. I can&#8217;t run as well as Kaa-sama.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Lilim, listen.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It would be better for my brother to be with Kaa-sama!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Listen, Lilim!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Lilim&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim buried her face in her mother&#8217;s chest and shook her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;If I hadn&#8217;t been demon-possessed, if I had been burned at the stake, Tou-sama would&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s my fault&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That man has changed since Lilim was born. He was always wielding a sword, but when I saw him reading a picture book to you, I thought he was going to lose his mind. He always said that this child was a genius.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou-sama&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Watching you grow has been such a joy for us. Lilim &#8230;&#8230; you certainly can&#8217;t fight. But you are a very smart girl. You have the knowledge to overcome difficulties. So you will be fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kaa-sama&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Lilim. Please take care of this child.&#8221;</p>



<p>The mother held out her little brother. The baby, who knew nothing about it, looked at Lilim with a puzzled expression.</p>



<p>Lilim received the baby in tears.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you, Lilim. We have been happy ever since you were born.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kaa-sama&#8230;&#8230;definitely, in the Midgar Kingdom&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Lilim, go now. Cross the river and get rid of the scent.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim turned around and went deeper into the forest to the east, turning around several times as she disappeared her scent in the shallow river.</p>



<p>The mother saw them off, and then sprinted southeast along the river.</p>



<p>Her loud footsteps echoed through the forest at night.</p>


<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>To the east.</p>



<p>Just as if being pushed, she went east.</p>



<p>Lilim ran through the dark forest. The winter night was cold, and her hands and feet were icy cold.</p>



<p>Then, at dawn, she exited the forest.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>It was the first time to see the sandy beach and the endless surface of the water. But with knowledge, Lilim knew.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s the sea.&#8221;</p>



<p>She licked the seawater to make sure.</p>



<p>&#8220;Salty&#8221;</p>



<p>There was no mistake.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou-sama&#8230;&#8230; there is nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>She exhaled white breath into the sky. Snow fell from the sky.</p>



<p>She sits on the cold sandy beach and face down.</p>



<p>&#8220;There is nothing &#8230;&#8230; in the east. Where is the mission &#8230;&#8230; where is the kingdom of Midgar &#8230;&#8230; Kaa-sama.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her legs were stiff, and she couldn&#8217;t take another step.</p>



<p>The black bruise spread to her chest. It throbbed and ached.</p>



<p>She has a little brother in her arms. Lilim had to protect the little life entrusted to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go &#8230;&#8230; and cross the sea.&#8221;</p>



<p>She knows that there is a country across the sea. She does not know if it is the Kingdom of Midgar, but she is sure it is because her father told her so.</p>



<p>Her mother is waiting for her there. Maybe her father is there too.</p>



<p>If she continues down the coast, she will find a fishing village. Somehow, try to get a ride on a boat.</p>



<p>Lilim started walking again.</p>



<p>——At that time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well well, there you are, in a place like this&#8221;</p>



<p>That priest stood in front of Lilim. The bloody chains jangled.</p>



<p>&#8220;D&#8230;&#8230; Don&#8217;t come&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>She backs away on trembling legs.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now here&#8217;s the question. Where is the one who has demon-possession?&#8221;</p>



<p>The priest held up the fresh head with a twisted smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;This man was different.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;To&#8230;&#8230; Tou-samaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!&#8221;</p>



<p>It was her father&#8217;s head.</p>



<p>His bloody neck made her imagine a violent end.</p>



<p>&#8220;This woman was different, too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying this, the priest holds up another fresh head.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kaa-samaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA&#8221;</p>



<p>It was her mother&#8217;s head.</p>



<p>Her mother was dead with her eyes wide open and looking at something.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why&#8230;&#8230;Whyy?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Now there are only two left.&#8221;</p>



<p>The priest throws away the two fresh heads and walks up to them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Noooooo&#8230;&#8230;Tou-sama&#8230;&#8230;Kaa-sama&#8230;&#8230; &#8220;</p>



<p>&#8220;There are very few reported cases of male demonic possession, but not zero.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;S-Stop&#8230;&#8230; D-Don&#8217;t touch my brother.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim hugs her brother with tears in her eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, which one of you is the demon-possessed one?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8230;&#8230; I am the one who got the demon possession, so please, my brother&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good girl. Nice and honest.&#8221;</p>



<p>The priest then stroked Lilim&#8217;s head with his blood-soaked hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hih&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This could be a long term relationship. Let me introduce myself. I am Petos, a high priest. You will be a valuable experiment.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My&#8230;&#8230;My brother is&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. I have no use for a child who is not demon-possessed.&#8221;</p>



<p>And Petos stroked her brother&#8217;s neck with the chain.</p>



<p>&#8220;So let&#8217;s kill him without making him suffer.&#8221;</p>



<p>Blood splattered.</p>



<p>The head of her brother fell out of Lilim&#8217;s arms.</p>



<p>&#8220;aaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAH&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kuku, kukukukukukuku. Come on, let&#8217;s celebrate.&#8221;</p>



<p>Petos gave a drawn-out laugh as he looked down at the screaming Lilim.</p>



<p>&#8220;AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!! Why, why!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Today is a great day. Thanks to you, I&#8217;m on my way to Rounds.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim picks up and gathers up the three heads that fell to the ground.</p>



<p>Her father, her mother, and her brother.</p>



<p>&#8220;aaaaaaAAAAA&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll kill you&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll definitely kill you!!&#8221;</p>



<p>With eyes tinged with hatred, Lilim screamed.</p>



<p>But Petos turned away, ignoring Lilim.</p>



<p>&#8220;——Are you done?&#8221;</p>



<p>Then he calls out towards the forest. Then a group of people in strange robes appeared.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, every single one of them.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Show me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Countless raw heads rolled on the beach. All were the heads of the golden leopard tribe.</p>



<p>&#8220;The Golden Leopard clan has all been taken care of. There will be no more information leaks.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s good to know.&#8221;</p>



<p>Those were words directed at Lilim.</p>



<p>&#8220;Your father&#8217;s enemy is dead.&#8221;</p>



<p>Petos laughed and tossed a fresh head to him. It was the head of the man who leads the branch of the family.</p>



<p>&#8220;AaaaaaaaaaaaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAH!!&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim kicked off the beach and jumped on Petos.</p>



<p>However, Lilim is blown away by Petos&#8217; chains.</p>



<p>&#8220;Geho&#8230;&#8230; K-Kill&#8230;&#8230; Kil&#8230;&#8230; yo&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Her body is not strong enough. Her consciousness fades.</p>



<p>&#8220;Take her into custody and send her to the Valiola laboratory. I&#8217;ll lay the groundwork for the faction——&#8221;</p>



<p>There, Lilim&#8217;s consciousness was cut off.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>


<p>When Lilim woke up, she was in a carriage.</p>



<p>Her hands and feet were shackled. Her mouth tasted of blood.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you&#8230;&#8230; All of you, definitely.&#8221;</p>



<p>When she muttered, the man on guard laughed with a snort.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll kill you&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The tears had already dried up.</p>



<p>The only thing holding her up was hatred.</p>



<p>What is needed is power.</p>



<p>Knowledge is useless. It cannot protect anyone. Pure power is the way.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want power&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim wished.</p>



<p>The power to destroy this restraint, the power to kill that priest, and——.</p>



<p>&#8220;——Do you want power?&#8221;</p>



<p>A voice echoed from somewhere.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>She looks around, but there is no one there except for the man on guard.</p>

<p>She looks around, but there is no one there except for the man on guard.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you want power——?&#8221;</p>



<p>This time she heard it clearly. It was a low voice, as if echoing from the depths.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want &#8230;&#8230;! If only I had the power &#8230;&#8230; if only I had the power!!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha, the kid&#8217;s gone crazy.&#8221;</p>



<p>The man on guard doesn&#8217;t seem to hear it. But it certainly reaches Lilim&#8217;s ears.</p>



<p>Even if this was an audio hallucination, or even if it was the devil. It didn&#8217;t matter to her.</p>



<p>She just wanted power.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you want power——I&#8217;ll give it to you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Then a blue-violet magic appeared in the carriage.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What&#8217;s this light&#8230;&#8230;!?&#8221;</p>



<p>The carriage stops and men enter from outside.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s going on?! What is this magic power!!&#8221;</p>



<p>The blue-violet magic spirals as fine particles.</p>



<p>In the center of the spiral, a shadow of a person appeared. It was a boy in a long jet-black coat.</p>



<p>&#8220;How did this guy get into the carriage?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Seize him! Drag him out of the wagon!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8230;&#8230;Am&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The boy raised his jet-black sword at the center of his magic.</p>



<p>The atmosphere trembles due to the enormous amount of magic power.</p>



<p>Lilim saw the overwhelming power converging in the jet-black sword.</p>



<p>This is exactly what she wanted.</p>



<p>The power to shatter everything.</p>



<p>&#8220;──pseudo-Atomic&#8221;</p>



<p>The magic power burst.</p>



<p>The sound faded and the world was tinged with a blue-violet light.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s about 60 points. It&#8217;s still incomplete.&#8221;</p>



<p>The boy&#8217;s voice woke Lilim up. Apparently, she had passed out.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is not enough to reach it. The goal I aim&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>He was muttering in the center of a large crater.</p>



<p>The carriage had blown away, and that eerie group had vanished without a trace.</p>



<p>Lilim trembled.</p>



<p>But this feeling is not fear.</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Ano&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? You woke up. For now, I&#8217;ll just heal the demon possession.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, he released a blue-violet magic power.</p>



<p>It glowed warmly around Lilim&#8217;s black bruise.</p>



<p>The blue-violet magic regenerates her skin as if it were rewinding time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Lies&#8230;&#8230;No way.&#8221;</p>



<p>When the light subsided, the black bruise had disappeared cleanly.</p>



<p>The demon possession that had tormented Lilim was easily cured.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think this one is 95 points. The control is near perfect. It&#8217;s exhausting, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;was not wrong&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Tears welled up from the bottom of her heart.</p>



<p>&#8220;wasn&#8217;t wrong&#8230;&#8230;Tou-sama wasn&#8217;t wrong&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;He said that demon possession is descended from heroes &#8230;&#8230; and that there is someone in the east who can cure demon possession &#8230;&#8230; and he wasn&#8217;t wrong about all that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That setting has been spread all the way there&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But why&#8230;&#8230; Why Tou-sama, why Kaa-sama&#8230;&#8230; Why&#8230;&#8230; everyone is, even though they weren&#8217;t wrong&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>



<p>The boy scratched his head.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s the fault of the Diabolos cult. It&#8217;s all the fault of the Diabolos cult.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Diabolos cult&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. The men I mentioned earlier are not from the Holy Church. They are actually from the Diabolos cult. They are hiding the truth, burying the children of heroes in the darkest corners of history, and plotting the resurrection of the demon Diabolos. To them, the Child of Heroes is an obstacle——&#8221;</p>



<p>He said so, and tossed his long jet-black coat.</p>



<p>&#8220;We are the Shadow Garden. We are the ones who hide in the shadows and hunt the shadows——&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Lurks in the shadows and hunts the shadows&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim&#8217;s heart trembled.</p>



<p>She felt like everything was connected.</p>



<p>&#8220;After all, Tou-sama was not wrong.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There is someone in the Kingdom of Midgar who can cure demon possession. That is where our mission lies. Tou-sama said so.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You are my mission&#8221;</p>



<p>Yes, this is her mission.</p>



<p>The death of her father, the death of her mother, and the death of her brother.</p>



<p>They sacrificed their lives to save Lilim.</p>



<p>&#8220;I want the power &#8230;&#8230; Give me the power to hunt them down!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fine, she should be here soon.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She&#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p>



<p>Then the darkness of the night shook.</p>



<p>She was a beautiful golden elf in a jet-black bodysuit.</p>



<p>&#8220;I said wait! We can&#8217;t keep up with your speed.&#8221;</p>



<p>She seems to be in a bit of a bad mood.</p>



<p>&#8220;But the mission is over.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I can tell when I see it. Looks like it&#8217;s definitely a cult carriage, all shattered up. I always told you to leave evidence.&#8221;</p>



<p>An elf girl stares at the boy with a grudging look on her face.</p>



<p>The boy scratched his head.</p>



<p>The elven girl sighs as if she has given up.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, she&#8217;s this time&#8230;&#8230;.&#8221;</p>



<p>She looked at Lilim.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. I left the rest to you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Hey!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, ask Alpha for the details.&#8221;</p>



<p>After saying so, he simply disappeared.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mou! He&#8217;ll soon leave.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ano&#8230;&#8230;.You are?&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim asked, and she smiled softly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, I guess I startled you. I&#8217;m Alpha. I&#8217;m the first seat of the Shadow Garden. Nice to meet you.&#8221;</p>

<p>&#8220;Alpha &#8230;&#8230; I am&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha stopped Lilim from trying to introduce herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait. You&#8217;re going to live under a different name from today.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We are the ones who lurk in the shadows and hunt the shadows. For us, the appearance of the front is just a mask. The shadows are who we really are. We may never return to the surface world again&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, Alpha held the mask in her hand.</p>



<p>Beautiful clear blue eyes looked at Lilim.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you are ready for that, accept it. Sixth seat of the Shadow Garden &#8220;Zeta&#8221;.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Zeta &#8230;&#8230; I am Zeta.&#8221;</p>



<p>Lilim muttered as if chewing.</p>



<p>&#8220;You seem determined. You have strong eyes. But&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I want power.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Your qualities are good enough. Eventually, you will gain great power. But that hatred will one day &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Alpha was about to say something but stopped.</p>



<p>Her blue eyes stare at Lilim for a while. And then——.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>



<p>She said sadly. White snow was falling silently from the night sky.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>&#8220;Umu, that was tough.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Zeta had finished telling him everything, he looked out and said so.</p>



<p>It was a casual word.</p>



<p>But it seemed like an all-encompassing statement. Zeta is not looking for thinly veiled sympathy.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn. It was tough.&#8221;</p>



<p>So Zeta responded without hesitation.</p>



<p>The hatred of that day was shoved deep into her heart and kept a lid on it. Unnecessary emotions interfere with the plan.</p>



<p>Her words were somehow reduced in order to prevent her emotions from leaking out at a moment&#8217;s notice.</p>



<p>It seemed like a favorable change for Zeta. It seemed to her that she was getting a little closer to her goal according to her emotional and physical changes.</p>



<p>&#8220;I am an abandoned cat. I was a tiny kitten that Master picked up. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;ve always wondered what kind of world Master wants. Master doesn&#8217;t tell me much. It was a little difficult for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Unn. Right.&#8221;</p>



<p>He held a glass of wine in his hand.</p>



<p>Zeta quickly prepared the wine and poured it into the glass. Then she snuggled up next to him.</p>



<p>&#8220;Master wants eternal life. I know what that means.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You got a good understanding.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Master is looking far ahead. So do I.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>He looked out the window at the deep darkness. Zeta also saw the deep darkness outside the window.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will resurrect the demon Diabolos&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I knew you wouldn&#8217;t stop me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not going to deny that choice.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Master is too kind. So Master can&#8217;t choose it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The world is not moved by kindness. That kindness is the shackles of Master.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Because I am not kind. Even if I endanger the world, I&#8217;ll resurrect it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; You&#8217;ll be hated.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t mind. Because that&#8217;s what the world needs——&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta leaned hesitantly on his shoulder.</p>



<p>&#8220;——I will be resented by the world in place of Master. Because that is my mission.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta turned away from him and backed away.</p>



<p>&#8220;When the time comes, cut me off &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>With those words, she disappeared into the darkness of the night.</p>



<p style="text-align:center"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/bWfmKsh/index-30-1.jpg" alt="index-30-1" border="0"></a></p>



<p>Zeta stood on a rooftop at night, looking down on the school. His golden tail swayed in the cold winter wind.</p>



<p>&#8220;——The time has come.&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta muttered.</p>



<p>&#8220;At last, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You made a decision, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>There were two shadows behind Zeta.</p>



<p>One is from Viktoria. And the other is a woman with a deep hood.</p>



<p>&#8220;Resurrect Demon Diabolos&#8221;</p>



<p>Zeta said.</p>



<p>&#8220;What did Shadow-sama say?&#8221;</p>



<p>Viktoria asked.</p>



<p>&#8220;We talked. That&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You didn&#8217;t get permission?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I had no intention of getting it in the first place. However, if I was stopped, I would have stopped.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In other words, they couldn&#8217;t stop it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Viktoria smiled.</p>



<p>&#8220;Unn. From here on out, it&#8217;s all on my own.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It would be a betrayal of Shadow Garden.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t care. Alpha is too kind. She has no vision after defeating the cult. But I am different.&#8221;</p>



<p>She squinted her ice-purple eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will resurrect the demon Diabolos and take the eternal life. And I will manage the world forever.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thereupon Shadow-sama becomes a god.&#8221;</p>



<p>Viktoria was entranced and her cheeks were blushing.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; You will be resented.&#8221;</p>



<p>The hooded girl, who had been silent until now, said.</p>



<p>&#8220;Master asked for eternal life. I will bear all the sins.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Now let&#8217;s go. Glory be to Shadow-sama.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Proceed with our plan.&#8221;</p>



<p>Viktoria and the hooded girl disappeared without a sound.</p>



<p>Only Zeta remained on the rooftop.</p>



<p>She stared down at the lights of the school.</p>



<p>&#8220;I will take it all away. Eternal life and control of the world. And then &#8230;&#8230; comes a perfect world where mistakes will never happen again &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>The lights of the academy flickered in the darkness of the night. It was like the torchlight of that day that brought back memories for Zeta.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is my mission&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>She hugged herself tightly, as if to make sure.</p>



<p>She&#8217;s fine, her knees aren&#8217;t shaking.</p>



<p>Her heart is calm.</p>



<p>She exhaled a deep white breath into the night sky.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tou-sama&#8230;&#8230; Master&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ve become stronger.&#8221;</p>



<p>She muttered, all alone.</p>
