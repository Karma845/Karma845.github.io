<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>July 7th.</p>

<p>Tanabata.</p>

<p>As usual, she came to the library after school.</p>

<p>&quot;I've been into taking selfies lately.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a little before 6 o'clock.</p>

<p>Since the five-minute bell had already rung, most of the students who had been using the library had already gone home. Thanks to that, Takanami-senpai's tone of voice had become quite casual.</p>

<p>&quot;I had never tried taking selfies before, so I didn't know how difficult it could be to take good ones.&quot;</p>

<p>She said while fiddling with her smartphone in her hand.</p>

<p>Indeed, I couldn't imagine Takanami-senpai taking random photos of cute cats or beautiful flowers. It's natural for someone who is not used to taking such photos to struggle when attempting a selfie.</p>

<p>&quot;But somehow I managed to take a good one... Want to see?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Since you've gone through the trouble, I might as well take a look.&quot;</p>

<p>That was my response.</p>

<p>&quot;Shizuru, are you still here?&quot;</p>

<p>Appearing was Renmi-senpai.</p>

<p>At that moment, Takanami-senpai let out a faint &quot;Hmm...&quot; and furrowed her brow. I didn't miss it.</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, Renmi-san, is something the matter?&quot;</p>

<p>However, she asked as if there was nothing wrong.</p>

<p>&quot;I had a bad feeling about something.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Really?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Just kidding.&quot;</p>

<p>Renmi-senpai said casually.</p>

<p>No, that premonition might actually be right.</p>

<p>&quot;I came by because I thought there might be something I could help with.&quot;</p>

<p>Just like back then.</p>

<p>&quot;Shizuru, is there something?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, actually, Takanami-senpai wants to show me her selfie, so Renmi-senpai, can you check it out first?&quot;</p>

<p>The so-called poison tester.</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm, let me see...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah!&quot;</p>

<p>When Renmi-senpai swiftly took the smartphone from Takanami-senpai's hand, Takanami-senpai let out a small voice.</p>

<p>And the moment Renmi-senpai looked at the display of the device, her face turned bright red.</p>

<p>&quot;You're trying to show something to Shizuru!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, I thought I should show her the lingerie I finally chose...&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai, who uttered those excuses, stood next to me, and I buried my head in my hands. ...As expected, it was poison. And a strong one at that. What kind of photo could make another woman blush like this?</p>

<p>&quot;I think it would look good with an oversized sweater on top of this.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hmm...&quot;</p>

<p>Renmi-senpai began to think seriously. After all, she's a girl. She must be sensitive to fashion discussions.</p>

<p>&quot;How about knee-high stockings with a garter belt?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Ah, that might be going too far from your taste, Renmi-senpai.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yeah, it seems hot. I'll pass.&quot;</p>

<p>Renmi-senpai is either sensitive to heat or maybe she's like that even in winter. In any case, she prefers to wear fewer clothes and have less skin covered.</p>

<p>And, in the first place, Renmi-senpai and Takanami-senpai have different perspectives. Takanami-senpai talks about fashionability or rather, how provocative the outfit is, while Renmi-senpai focuses on functionality, specifically her own preferred functionality.</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, Shizuru? You really understand a lot, don't you?&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai smiled at me, but her eyes didn't, making it quite scary.</p>

<p>Well, after spending almost a month together in daily life, you start to understand each other's tastes to some extent.</p>

<p>&quot;You two never learn, do you? Shizuru won't be affected by something like that.&quot;</p>

<p>Appearing was Kanata-senpai, and involuntarily, a voice of &quot;Uh...&quot; escaped my mouth.</p>

<p>&quot;I remembered something.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai raised her voice.</p>

<p>&quot;Didn't Shizuru say he's familiar with the female body?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;What? I want to hear about that too.&quot;</p>

<p>And as always, I was being cornered. Couldn't they focus their questioning on the person making the controversial statements?</p>

<p>...</p>

<p>I looked up diagonally, leaning my upper body backward. I'm starting to get used to this kind of situation. I'm on the verge of enlightenment.</p>

<p>In the first place, Kanata-senpai is mistaken. If it's swimsuit photos of idols in manga magazines' gravure pages, I might eventually get used to them. However, it doesn't apply to people I'm close to. Moreover, if they are attractive or someone I have feelings for, it's even more so.</p>

<p>If I had accidentally seen Takanami-senpai's selfie from earlier, I would have been surprised and fallen off my chair. And Renmi-senpai's revealing loungewear always gives me a startle. Of course, it's the same for Kanata-senpai. No matter how slender her body is, it doesn't mean I'll get used to it no matter how many times I see it.</p>

<p>&quot;How are you going to handle this?&quot;</p>

<p>I gave a resentful look to the source of all the trouble.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, can't be helped.&quot;</p>

<p>With a sigh, Kanata-senpai shrugged her shoulders.</p>

<p>&quot;Both of you, come out. It seems they're closing.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh? Wait, wait...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Hey, don't push me.&quot;</p>

<p>Pushing Takanami-senpai and Renmi-senpai alternately with one hand, Kanata-senpai moved towards the entrance. And soon, the three of them disappeared from sight.</p>

<p>If they're going to interrogate someone, couldn't it be Kanata-senpai instead? ...No, if that happens, she'll deliberately use ambiguous expressions that lead to misunderstandings, and I'll be the one to suffer.</p>

<p>&quot;Well then, time to clean up.&quot;</p>

<p>Consciously pronouncing those words, I began the process of closing up the library.</p>

<p>&sect;&sect;&sect;</p>

<p> After closing the library and returning the key to the staff room, I went down to the entrance, where Takanami Ruka was standing.</p>

<p>She was looking up at the Tanabata bamboo decorations.</p>

<p>It seems like she's the only one here. Renmi-senpai and Kanata-senpai must have gone home earlier.</p>

<p>&quot;We're tidying this up today too.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>I stood beside her and looked up at the bamboo decorations as well.</p>

<p>The bamboo, with a significantly increased number of strips compared to the first day, will be tidied up today. Since it was installed late, the student council might appear to clean it up if we wait.</p>

<p>&quot;Do you have any wishes for the last time?&quot;</p>

<p>Since she was staring so intently, I asked her that.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, yes. I have a favor to ask. But it's not for Orihime, it's for you, Shizuru.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Me?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai turned to face me.</p>

<p>In the deserted evening entrance, we faced each other in front of the Tanabata decorations.</p>

<p>&quot;I like you, Shizuru.&quot;</p>

<p>And Takanami-senpai earnestly and quietly confessed.</p>

<p>&quot;I feel like I haven't properly said it before. I've only been pushing you.&quot;</p>

<p>She chuckled awkwardly and then returned to a serious expression.</p>

<p>&quot;I like you. That's why I want you to be my boyfriend.&quot;</p>

<p>It was a never-before-seen, frighteningly serious expression as Takanami Ruka conveyed her feelings to me.</p>

<p>Certainly, I feel like I've never heard such straightforward words until now.</p>

<p>So, I must also give a serious answer. To her and to myself, sincerely.</p>

<p>I turned on my heel.</p>

<p>&quot;I refuse. Please ask someone else.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Huh...?&quot;</p>

<p>A dumbfounded voice escaped Takanami-senpai's mouth.</p>

<p>Leaving her behind, I started changing my shoes at the shoe locker.</p>

<p>&quot;Wait a minute!&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai suddenly snapped out of it and hurriedly chased after me.</p>

<p>&quot;This isn't where you should be shaking your head, right!?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Why?&quot;</p>

<p>I asked back while putting on the school-designated leather shoes.</p>

<p>&quot;Why... because you like me, don't you?&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Oh, yeah, did I say something like that?&quot;</p>

<p>It's only natural for her to be upset.</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if it's not mutual love! Being boyfriend and girlfriend means acting lovey-dovey when we're alone while hiding it from others, sneaking kisses behind the bookshelves even when people are around! That's how it's supposed to be!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;I don't know about that.&quot;</p>

<p>I can understand the first part, but her own values become too strong midway.</p>

<p>&quot;I said let's be together.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Yes. But to be precise, it's like this. &#8213;&#8213; 'As we have been.'&quot;</p>

<p>So, if we were to enter a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship like Takanami-senpai wants, it wouldn't be &quot;as we have been.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;That's just sophistry!&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Sophistry is fine... Well, I do have genuine feelings of liking you, I'm sure of that. And once I become more confident in my other emotions, I do intend to respond to Takanami-senpai's feelings. But for now...&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;Well, if you say things like that, I won't be able to say anything.&quot;</p>

<p>Takanami-senpai pouted.</p>

<p>&quot;Shall we go home soon? If we linger here, the student council might appear and make us help clean up the bamboo decorations.&quot;</p>

<p>&quot;And the fact that you're leaving alone first shows some progress, I suppose.&quot;</p>

<p>This time, she let out a small sigh.</p>

<p>Then she started changing her shoes.</p>
