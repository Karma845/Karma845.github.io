<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 7: After this battle, we're getting married:</h1> 

<p>Lv. 4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Strength: SS 1033 → SSS 1379 Endurance: SSS 1218 → 1501 Dexterity: SS 1041 </p>
<p class="calibre1">→ SSS 1383 Agility: SS 1089 → SSS 1442 Magic: S 965 → SSS 1251 </p>

<p class="calibre1">"............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kami-sama and I stared at the updated [Ability Value] - the final ability value of Lv. </p>
<p class="calibre1">4 - and remained silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Bell-kun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... I am." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kami-sama still looked at the two people holding this updated paper with only the ability value written on it and spoke thoughtfully, while I was still sitting upright with my upper body naked and a serious face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How hard did you get beaten up at Freya's place? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was beaten to the point of clicking, then crunching, and finally the whole thing was unrecognizable, so I can say it was definitely the cruelest in my life so far ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">No, in terms of the most brutal degree in an instant, it's still 『deeper』 that is more powerful ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this time the hell lasted for a long, long time, and in that sense, this time the </p>
<p class="calibre1">『baptism』 ...... was better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After I replied with a lack of words, Kami-sama said nothing more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather, she closed her eyes and graciously embraced me as if she were a child returning from war from seeing her father again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her hands went around to the back of my head and pang-pang patted the back of my head gently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I did the same, and although my face was tucked into Kami-sama's ample chest, I really still had a serious look on my face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After both of them let go of each other, Kami-sama let out a mega sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haah ~~~~~~~~~ ............ I'm really so sorry, Bell-kun. You were thrown to a very unbelievable place, but I couldn't save you from it ....... You're still suffering at the end of the day." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There is no such thing. The gods have come to save me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermes-sama and Asfi-sama said to me that the gods had done everything they could to remove the "charm" that had been inflicted on the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p44"></a>I couldn't do anything about the box because I was too busy to take care of myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that Kami-sama and the girls were able to break it was really impressive, and there was no doubt that it did take so long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's why I raised my face and spoke my true thoughts to Hestia-sama, who had slumped her shoulders into a sullen state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At that time, when you guys broke in from the air to save me, Kami-sama ...... I was really very happy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I looked into her eyes and said one word at a time, and then the pupils of the gods trembled like they were deeply moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  her  hands  went  around  my  body  again  and  shouted  "Bell-kun~~~!  She hugged me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was buried between my soft breasts, and this time my face even turned red to my ears because of the embarrassment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a while Kami-sama released me and wiped the corners of my eyes a few times with force with his arm, then looked back at the update paper held in his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But ...... this rise is really impressive, really. Saying things like wanting you, but bullying you so hard, Freya seems to have a sadistic fetish! That must be true!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ahaha ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kami-sama complained about the one who wasn't present in a sharp, aggressive tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps,  the  fact  that  her  familia's  favor  (ability  value)  had  been  updated  by someone  else  also  made  her  very  angry  now.  Or  maybe  it  was  the  anger  she showed at herself for not being able to do anything about it at that time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thanks to this, I can't say the same ...... [ability value] has increased a lot in one breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... ah ah. You're already very powerful after returning from the 'deep level', and this is even stronger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The total number of proficiency upward values is over 1600. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was also more than one SSS, and the ability rating was very impressive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thinking  back  to  the  『killings』  in  the  wilderness  from  morning  to  night,  I  was temporarily immersed in unspeakable emotions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, I met Kami-sama's gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, Kami-sama-" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hmm. Let's [upgrade] now, Bell-kun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that, Kami-sama said as if to say that everything was ready. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He tapped the back of me sitting on the bed with his index finger. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p45"></a>It was a feeling as if deep inside, the seat of the soul was tapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My back turned into water, and the quiet ripples gradually spread throughout my body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I felt this fantasy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After this fantasy - a wow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The [sacred words] engraved on it burned and released heat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  unprecedented  sensation  made  me  hold  my  breath,  and  during  this  time, Kami-sama  noted  down  the  [Ability  Value]  that  finished  sublimation  on  another update paper. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Bell Cranny </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lv. 5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Strength: I 0 Endurance: I 0 Dexterity: I 0 Magic: I 0 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luck: F Abnormal resistance: G Escape: I → G Combo attack: I Magic </p>
<p class="calibre1">【Flame Volt </p>
<p class="calibre1">* Quick attack magic </p>
<p class="calibre1">Skills </p>
<p class="calibre1">【Hero Wish】 </p>
<p class="calibre1">* Can be stored for active actions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">【Bullfighting Instinct】 </p>
<p class="calibre1">*  When  fighting  a  fierce  bull-based  enemy,  the  full  ability  increases  super dramatically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">【Vanadis-Tevere】 </p>
<p class="calibre1">* Virgin's protection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">* Activated when invaded by a charm effect. All ability values increase dramatically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">* Physical strength and mental strength are permanently restored. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Congratulations, Bell-kun ...... you are Lv. 5 now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kami-sama said, while handing me the update paper as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since there is only one slot, of course no new 『Magic』 will be found. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The newly revealed『Skill』is also a logical『Anti-Charm Special Type』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the conditions are met, it should be very powerful, but this war game probably won't involve it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p46"></a>The『Developed ability』that will be revealed with the sublimation is『Continuous attack』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  remember  that  the  guild  information  that  Eina-san  told  me  said  that  the  more consecutive attacks, the more powerful they are, and that they are valuable attack-type abilities. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this information is just a minor detail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most important thing was the number that danced on the paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lv. 5. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if I am just an adventurer, I can understand what the number '5' represents and what kind of weight it carries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell Cranel became a "First Level Adventurer". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strongest battle force that Labyrinth City is proud of, I managed to be among them and came to the bottom of the list. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I finally made it to this step ...... nowadays, I should have been able to reach out my hand to the back of the longing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Obviously so -) </p>
<p class="calibre1">This result was enough to make me cheer, but I still have a nervous face today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm afraid the gods were thinking the same thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia-sama, who sent the congratulatory message, also pursed her lips and didn't say a word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Kami-sama." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... What is it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you think that I can fight evenly with Master (Master) and their ...... cadres of </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Freya's Familia]? </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a question after taking into account the savings before the [Upgrade] and after taking into account the hidden value (Extra Point). </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if trying to grasp a ray of hope, the familia member (me) asked the other party what he thought as a god of the Lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... I am not a god of battle. So I can't be as specific as Ken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord God was silent for a moment, then said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You should ...... not be able to counteract Freya's dependents." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I do not feel that this judgment of the gods is cruel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because I myself felt this irrefutable fact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The number "5" shows the greatness that I have achieved, but I find it so hard to trust. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p47"></a>Lv. 6, and Lv. 7. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What we are about to see is this kind of 'strongest' beyond imagination. </p>







<p class="calibre1">"...... What should I do about this?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Sea of Words, Lily sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the middle of the library of the base, all the floors, as well as the tables were scattered with countless parchments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All of them were information about the [Freya's familia] faction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Welf was in the workshop making the "Magic Sword", while Mikoto and Haruhime went to Takemikazuchi and Aisha, trying to polish their abilities and "skills" as much as possible. All of them were preparing for the war game, doing what they could, and as a staff member of the faction, Lily also gathered as much information about the enemy as she could. She also relied on the help of Eina, who was affiliated with the guild, to get all the information she could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Overpowered. There's simply nothing we can do about it ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The more I read on and analyzed, the more I was hit by the word 'despair'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The disparity in combat power is unbridgeable. The two are more than a dog and a lion. It was like an ant and a dragon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought I already knew what "the strongest in the city" meant, but only now did Lili finally feel it in concrete terms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There  are  currently  157  dependents,  including  non-combatants  and  believers, there are more than 5,000 people ...... The strength of the first level adventurers is not necessary to mention, the second level adventurers are also numerous. The number of healers in particular topped the list of the [familia members] belonging to O'Leary ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just looking at the numbers listed above, Lily wanted to vomit a little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if you look at the total number of Lv. 3 and Lv. 4 that are classified as second level adventurers, it makes you want to pack your bags and run away overnight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a simple way to compare the difference between [Freya's Familia] and the </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p48"></a>faction  warlords:  if  [Freya's  Familia]  is  disbanded,  there  are  enough  people  to create twenty "middle faction warlords". </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, above these second level adventurers, the first level adventurers are led by the [Fierce]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A single blast of super short text chanting is able to wipe out the 『Lower Level』 </p>
<p class="calibre1">monster feast ...... don't be ridiculous ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the [Familia], the leakage of information about "magic" and "skills" is fatal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore  the  guild  also  approved  this  lifeline  of  their  concealed  dependents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  the  information  collected  by  Eina  should  be  noted  that  it  was  only  a rumor from the mouths of the staff and adventurers, and it was a 'general ability'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even this "general" content was enough to dampen Lily's will to fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wide range of projectiles and the powerful artillery that raised doubts about the concept of "magic swordsman". </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is said to dominate the war game with only four people, and the prum's company. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Chariot's legs, which surpassed the "Fierce Wolf" and easily gained the name of the fastest in the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the orc instinct that was said to have been shown several times during the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"dark period". </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  they  still  had  a  'killer',  then  as  a  commander,  Lily  would  have  to  faint  to  the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Not enough manpower. The lack of manpower was even a bit desperate. From the beginning, I knew very well that there was a gap in power between [Hestia's Familia] and [Freya's Familia]. But, even so ......!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  truly  terrifying  thing  is  that  even  with  the  battle  power  of  the  Forge  God (Hephaestus) and the girls, her side does not have the slightest chance of winning today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had already found out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Goddess Festival" was an instant killing attack, and even that was the result of mercy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "I have to plan the battle ............ but what should I do ............"? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of the overwhelming gap in basic combat power, her thoughts kept spinning in the same place, murmuring the same words as earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daphne was helping with Miach and the others to refine the reparation medicine as well as the cure-all, but even with the help of her wisdom, Lily didn't think there would be any hope. How about Daphne might as well be holding her head right now, planning to run away for the night. Lily's face had lost all its blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p49"></a>It would have to be a 『Supreme Commander』 who had a higher focus than Lily and the girls in order to overturn such a plate... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Supporters! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Lily was staring at the line between escapism and despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia rushed into the library, as if she was about to kick the door open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hestia-sama ......? What's wrong ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A guest is looking for you! No, no, I don't know whether to call a guest or not, but someone is here! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gods are obviously, but Hestia is unusually shaken, and Lily was wondering at her gesture, but after seeing the person who followed her in, she immediately understood the reason for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hello. It's  been a long time, but  not really. ...... Long time  no greeting,  Liliruca Arde." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A hand raised, walked into the room is the same Familia of golden hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The first time I saw you, I was in the middle of the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All this is information about Freya's Familia? You've collected so much." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn ignored the surprised Lily and leisurely picked up the parchments scattered on the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She used her sight to ask the main god 'what's going on here', but Hestia also just shook her head forcefully. It seemed that this was really a surprise visit without a prior appointment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, Hestia, who had been behaving strangely, said something like "Well, then, take your time, two of you-" and left in a hurry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems that she, the main god, is trying to put all the trouble on Lily. This wasted goddess was unforgivable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She's been gathering information about the enemy without sleep. For someone who is in charge of command, this act is quite correct." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... sense, thanks for the compliment ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn glanced at Lili, whose fatigue was piling up under her eyes, and said with a light smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily,  who  still  did  not  understand  the  situation,  nodded  her  head  with  difficulty, however </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But, there is no need." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sh......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn scattered the parchment in one hand to the sky, causing the maroon pupils to open wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p50"></a>"I'll provide information on all aspects. The tactics that [Freya's Familia] is good at, the details of the 'magic' and 'skills' that we have, all of them will be provided to you. I'll provide it to you from the first level adventurer (me) who has fought with them countless times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, Lily really held her breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The insight possessed by someone who had actually fought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was so different from the vague rumors that it might become an absolute weapon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And it was the insight of a first level adventurer, and with those eyes of insight, it should possess a more valuable value than mere facts. After all, the [Loki Familia] </p>
<p class="calibre1">should have been studying and investigating the long-time enemy (Freya Familia). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe they can build a countermeasure with just Lily's current hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  will  turn  you  into  a  unique  "Commander".  I  will  turn  you  into  a  unique </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Commander', a supreme commander who can lead the allied forces of the faction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The powerful words that brought courage struck her heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An impulse to salivate and dart at her rose up, but - with a jolt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily pushed it down with a spirit of steel and asked the fellow soldier in front of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"May I ask what is your intention ......? I can't believe I would step in to help ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh yeah, do I need to explain?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily desperately tried to maintain her sanity, while Finn narrowed his eyes as if he was looking at his fancy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, he gave a slightly exaggerated shrug. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  [Freya  Familia]......  or  the  goddess  Freya  has  broken  the  taboo.  She  has trampled  on  the  dignity  of  the  lower  world  using  some  sense  of  the  most  cruel means and distorted ourselves." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This, this ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is something that should have been condemned. Although the guild will not lose anything by saying anything, the 'unpleasant feeling' will remain. For you who admire Bell Cranel, this anger is even more exuberant. Am I wrong?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Actually, I'm just as angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn was absolutely right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there was no lie in his words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What  the  guild  forbids  is  participation  in  war  games.  Then  I  will  lend  you  my wisdom until the moment before the battle begins. ...... Forget it, it's better to make it clearer. I hope you can teach the goddess Freya and also Ottar and them a hard lesson." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, Finn vaguely with a childlike sense of mischief, so concluded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p51"></a>He should be frankly saying "the name of justice" and the real "a hint of truth". The brave  men  of  the  Ichigo  Familia  offered  a  helping  hand  both  in  terms  of appearances and feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Lily could not make a decision immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was impossible for only one side to benefit from [the Familia]. Although he was not a faction valve of the God of Fraud (Hermes Familia), it was common sense to be vigilant first when encountering good things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he took this hand, would the other side demand some kind of price? </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is exactly what should be left to the main god (Hestia) to judge, right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing his compatriot's stance as a [familia] counselor always hesitating, Finn he that </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... seventy points." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Showing what looked like a bitter smile, she whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">" Liliruca Arde. You are to be commended for this prudent gesture. However, what you should be doing right now is not something to probe my intentions." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For the sake of this desperate battle that even Guts (me) wants to leave behind, you must use everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing that even somewhat cruel statement, Lily's heartbeat became especially violent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At least that's what I would do if I were in your position. Even if it means snatching untold amounts of information from the hands of the reputed One Nation's brave men." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You have a very timid side, just like Bell Cranel. This is not to belittle you. Because cowardice can be a virtue. But right now, your greatest fear should be -" </p>
<p class="calibre1">--someone important is far from your side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This last statement was the last straw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lilly released her tiny fist and extended her hand to Finn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm very sorry to show you that Lily is not decent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh ...... and?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please, Finn-sama! Please lend your wisdom to Lily! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn held Lily's hand back and responded to her determined mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young goddess who peeped through the door and saw the scene also shouted </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes! " and clenched her fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since then, the [Hestia Familia] has been allied with the [Guts]. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p52"></a>"...... but, that ...... Lily, we can repay you, there is not much ...... or hope that you do not expect a reward at the beginning or something like that ...... or hope that you can be merciful ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You don't need to care about that. I just said, as long as I can return to Ottar and them, my face and cheap reserve and so on is also considered to be preserved." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing Lily, whose imposing aura just  now seemed like a phantom, and whose attitude was weak because she was afraid of『debt』, Finn said with a bitter smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Moreover, you have a lot of 'popularity'. Besides me, there should be many people who are willing to lend a hand, right? </p>







<p class="calibre1">"Why aren't you allowed to fight with Agno-kun and the others-? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiona's loud voice resounded all around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Loki Familia] base, "Dusk House". </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the living room, the Amazon girl was shouting with her hands in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So many factions are fighting with [Freya's Familia]! Why can't we?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How many times has it been stated? This is a strict order from the guild. It's almost like a mandatory task, can you understand that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who tried to calm her down was the dwarf Gareth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  this  battle-hardened  warrior,  who  was  dealing  with  Tiona,  who  could  be considered a bear, was now like a tired parent. No matter how much he tried to reason with her, Tiona kept shouting like a child, "I don't understand...! stamping her feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I want to help Agnor-kun and the others...! I'd like to help them and make up for the way I spoke to him! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No. You behave yourself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why ~~~~~! How petty ~~~~~~~!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The expression on Gareth's face when he saw the young girl making a fuss in the pavilion seemed to say that he was tired of even sighing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really, you are at least a faction valve cadre ....... If you don't listen to me again, I'm going to press you to the ground like Burt did? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gareth's face and sturdy arms were covered in scars. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p53"></a>The werewolf Burt's discontent had already finished exploding. He had said before that he would kick [Freya's familia] to death in the war game, and did not listen to any advice, and even started to fight, so Gareth subdued him by strength. But even so, of course, the werewolf would not be convinced, he viciously spat out a "Damn it! He went to the dungeon and is now making a fuss inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If I can join the war games by defeating Gareth, then I will fight! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't say it as if the old man is not worth it. ...... Even if you could take care of me, the guild wouldn't recognize it. If you ignore the rules and barge into the war game, it's [Hestia's familia] breaking the rules, they are going to lose. Then it's not a matter of returning that young man's favor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well ~~~~~~~~~! </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of Gareth's positive argument, Tiona scratched her hair with both hands and eventually danced strangely, looking up at the ceiling and twirling around in a slithering circle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her twin sister interjected as if she couldn't stand to watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gareth.  It's  the  chief's  order,  so  I'll  obey,  but  ......  I'm  not  taking  it.  The  other members of the regiment (Raul) they just don't say it with their mouths, but their hearts should be thinking the same thing. Although only tampered with Bell Cranel and [Hestia familia] related, but after all, it is the memory that was tampered with." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the words of Tionne who was leaning on the backrest of the bench, Gareth closed his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  old  man  was  actually  thinking  the  same  thing  -  that  sincere  statement  was about to slip from the corner of his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You  guys,  don't  do  this.  You  guys  know  very  well  that  it's  not  Gareth's responsibility, right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Riveria ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tiona too, stop it. Don't forget you're still a faction cadre." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ooooooooooooooooooooooo ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The High  Elf Rivelia  appeared in the middle of the living room, her long tied up emerald hair swaying gently with her movements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the deputy head of the faction valve, after admonishing her sisters, she lowered her eyes again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you have an opinion, you should at least say it to me. ...... I'll listen to all your complaints." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rivelia ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  attitude  of  hers  caused  Tiona  and  Tionne  to  look  up,  while  the  elf  walked towards the dwarf. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p54"></a>"I'm sorry, Gareth ...... blame it on my caprice." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... How can this be your selfishness? The other side have revealed a bit of the coordinates of the 『Ice Garden』, the old men can not sit back and do nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Two people lowered their voices while talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  were  talking  about  the  『transaction』  between  Finn  and  Royman  -  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">『price』 that couldn't be ignored, to be precise. Livia Leos Alpher must not let go of this information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This matter could not be made clear to Tiona and the girls yet, but even if it was, Gareth and the others had to convince them with what was on the surface. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If  I  go  to  call  Ace,  she  will  only  say  'sorry'~~.  Well  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ </p>
<p class="calibre1">hmmm! .................. mmm!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tionne moaned for a while, then gave up thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「Let's go, Tionne! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tiona, where are you going?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Agnor-kun's side!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiona answered loudly to Riviera's question as she rushed out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her sister helplessly chased after her, at which point she turned back and spat her tongue out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even if I can't participate in the war games, I'll be Agno-kun's companion!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiona  stormed  out  of  the  clubhouse  in  a  blaze  of  glory,  and  coincidentally,  she came to the same conclusion as Finn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Loki Familia] - not participating in the war. </p>


<p class="calibre1">"That means that the entire [Familia] is going to help Verge, right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the huge forge, Tsubaki Kobrand asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the northeast of the city, the "Valka Red Room" in the "Industrial District" was standing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The base of this forge of the Hephaestus Familia was different from the branches inside the "Avenue of Adventurers" and the "Tower of Babel", and the half-blood dwarf who had just fought a new "Magic Sword" here wiped off a large sweat from his arm and looked at his master god. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's right. Now that Loki and the girls have confirmed that they can't participate in the war games, then only we will provide full support to Hestia and the girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hephaestus looked around the circle and answered the chief's final confirmation with an expressionless face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p55"></a>The sound of hammers rang out one after another. The furnace was also running at full speed, spilling deadly heat all around. One of the group members fearfully handed  over  the  newly  forged  'Magic  Sword',  and  the  god  of  forging  swept  the blade and then said mercilessly, "No. Start again. Start again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling the Lord God's stricter-than-usual voice - the level of refinement needed to be achieved for the armament used in the Great War - even the forger with a smith's temperament became trembling, while Tsubaki gave a strange smile, as if trying to curl the corners of her mouth, but failing to do so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The war with the [Freya Familia]. I'm interested in whether my own weaponry can work against them, but ...... body still trembles." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not a tremor from excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  eyes  of  the  highest  level  forger  at  Lv.  5,  the  strong  warriors  of  [Freya's Familia] were not "weapon wielding users" but rather "berserk warriors who kept fighting". She didn't understand at all, with the weapons she prepared, how she had to slash down and how she had to pierce to block them and their advance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But ...... I can only go for it. If this continues, Shidoshi (Vergil) can be crushed to death." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  a  moment's  pause  in  his  hands,  as  if  to  shake  off  the  distracting  thoughts coiled in his body, Tsubaki picked up the hammer again and swung it down aiming at the newly heated refined metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Hephaestus Familia] - Engage in battle. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Why is that, sister-sama! Why are we not allowed to participate in war games!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The base of the Ganesha Familia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The entrance was located in between the strands, and inside the giant elephant, which  was  also  a  giant  statue,  "I  am  Ganesha",  the  Amazon  deputy  chief,  Ilta Farna, complained loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because our master is the Lord of the Masses (Ganesha), because we are called </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Urban Gendarme'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  Ilta  shouting  as  much  as  her  fellow  clown  faction  valve  (somewhere) (Amazons), Headmaster Shakti sighed once again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Since they're gendarmes, it's the right time to arrest Freya's group, include those brutal acts so far, and impose sanctions! It's because of those guys that Orario is so badly damaged! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even so, the guild doesn't want this to happen." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p56"></a>"That's nothing! If you're strong, you can do whatever you want! I'm very familiar with this, it's the barbarian (Amazon) colony, when did the city at the center of the world (Orario) fall to this! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  this  gesture  of  Shakti  that  prevailed  with  her  own  position,  Iltar  became more and more agitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though she was now running the orderly side, when she first entered Orario, Ilta was the leader of the scoundrels. As a female warrior, she judged good and evil based on the basis of strength and weakness, and did countless brutal things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One day, such a woman was given a "judgment" by Shakti and her sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their  spirit  of  subduing  their  own  strength  -  and  guarding  those  weaker  than themselves - struck the then-Ilta and made her admire them. She even became unlike a female warrior (Amazon). After that she joined the [Ganesha familia], and a rare Amazon gendarme was born. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's why she couldn't stand the intentions of the somewhat corrupt guild and the behavior of her big sister (Shakti) and their sidekicks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... This time, the  scale of the war games, including the  personnel, will  be the largest in history. Do you understand that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course! But what's wrong with that!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  format  of  the  decision  has  not  been  decided  yet,  but  I'm  afraid  that  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">'battlefield' will be a vast land outside the city. There is no one else but us who can monitor and restrict the battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  the  head  of  the  [Familia]  who  was  proud  of  having  the  largest  number  of regiment members in the metropolis, Shakti mentioned 『this matter』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We and others must monitor the surroundings ...... as a third party that has no connection with the war game, and if something goes wrong, perhaps it will make other countries - other metropolises get involved." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There  are  countless  organizations  that  expect  a  balance  of  power  and  plan  to weaken Orario. The same is true of the evil gods of the "Dark Faction Mimics". If the extremely weak [Freya's familia] or the faction alliance becomes the target ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">may lead to the decline of the city's battle power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What Shakti said was 『politics』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the point of view that Ilta does not have yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  member  of  the  Labyrinth  City  that  holds  the  fate  of  the  world,  which  is entrusted to the three great adventurers, Shakti is very clear about her identity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ilta, who was bound by the matter at hand, did not think about this. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p57"></a>Regardless  of  what  she  thought,  as  the  head  of  the  gendarmerie,  Shakti  was prepared to swallow both the clean and the dirty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We are the only ones who can conduct the "trial". If you want to regulate the [Freya Familia] and strive for fairness, it is even more so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This, this ......! But ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The preparation of the battlefield, the expulsion of monsters and the management of the area. In every sense, only the [Ganesha Familia] was responsible for the logistics, and the 'Faction War' could be held. Hearing Shakti teach so, the aura that Ilta had just now was getting weaker and weaker. Just when the feelings in her heart had nowhere to land, she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Calm down, okay? Ahhhhhhhhhhhh Ilta-san! If we don't run the war games, who will be the host? The one who is going to scorch everyone's eardrums will be my talking flame magic [Flame Burst Flame]! Ilta Achaa's duty ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shut up Ibri! You're going to break my eardrums, you idiot! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please, please calm down, Ilta-san! And Ibri, don't curl your tongue!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm calm, Moncada! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pity! Just one word! My name is Modaka!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What! Are you kidding me!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then you should remember what my name is... I'm not serious! We've actually known each other for a long time! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're so loud! I blame your name for being so easy to get wrong! Hey, Ganesha! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don't shut up and say something! Let's hear what the Lord God thinks!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm Ganesha!" "I'm Ganesha!" "I'm Ganesha!" "I'm Ganesha!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're a bunch of shit! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The group member who interjected from the side + the main god who sought his advice turned into explosives and Ilta beautifully spewed out flames. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  this  general  mobilization  of  agitation  and  rage,  Shakti,  the  only  decent person, let out a long, long sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Ganesha Families] - No participation in the war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you, are you serious, Mord!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the wails of the humans of the same faction, Guile and Scott, Mord Latro shouted in response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes! We will follow [Hestia's familia]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is an out-of-the-way tavern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before many of his peers could decide their attitude in the war games, a state of affairs  akin  to  an  intelligence  war  naturally  broke  out  in  the  city,  and  Mord  said clearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p58"></a>"I have convinced the Lord God (Ogma)! He said something like "I won't build your graves even if you die", but I don't care about that! This battle is not just the city (Orario),  the  whole  world  is  watching,  and  we're  going  to  make  a  name  for ourselves in it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He, plus Scott and Guile who were sitting around the round table, belonged to the faction valve [Ogma Familia]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grade F. With Lv. 2 members of the group, not very famous, the status is not to the bottom, but to call it a middle faction valve, and some twisted, really like the Mord and them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that's all for today, Mord slapped the wooden cup he was drinking from onto the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The bottom line is! If you become the winner of this war game, you will get the property of [Freya's Familia]! If it also includes land, it's worth more than a smaller kingdom! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The winner of the war game can take all kinds of things from the loser. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  this  rule  is  followed,  then  after  defeating  [Freya's  Familia],  the  people  who assisted [Hestia's Familia] can naturally demand payment. Even if it's not to "make a break" with Freya who has changed her perception, there is a clear price (reward) in it, said Mord fervently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Billionaire is not a problem at all! The days of drinking cheap wine in Labyrinth Street can also end there ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  if  the  faction  valves  split  the  spoils  equally,  with  the  wealth  that  [Freya's Familia] possesses, everyone is bound to get an amount sufficient to throw away a thousand dollars. The smile that appeared on Mord's face showed the face of a </p>
<p class="calibre1">'scoundrel' with a bad taste in his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Scott and Guile first looked at each other ...... and then sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't pretend, Mord." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Say what you really mean." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Guile say that, Scotty couldn't stop nodding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The adventurer who had been friends with him for a long time then pointed out the problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I said that you just want to help Bell Cranel, right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he was pointed out like that, Mord's face instantly turned red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You were in a bad mood when that guy did something stupid to the dragon lady and was hated by the people in the city, weren't you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In the war game of [Apollo's familia], you also bet all your money on it ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p59"></a>"When the "charm" was lifted, and when you entered Freya's base, you were also in a bad mood. You just couldn't bear to see [Rabbit foot] in danger. ...... like a big brother or a father who is worried about his younger brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What a stupid thing to say! I'm not ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mentioning the past, Mord stood up and shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was going to deny it in a smooth manner, but he was watched by Guile and Scott, and still did not say the latter words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... is not. I didn't let go of that brat ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Mord sat back in his chair feebly, clenched his teeth and chanted for a while, then raised his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's just that the guy saved my life and I haven't paid him back yet! </p>
<p class="calibre1">About six months ago. The "Black Goliath" that appeared on the 18th floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To Bell, who had gone through the feast of the Unseen, but still saved himself, his feelings were not 'friendship' but 'debt', and Mord spitefully said so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, yes, yes, I know, I know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Seeing  you  cover  up  and  be  embarrassed  here  is  just  disgusting.  It's  not  even good enough for a drink." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You, you! Bastards! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mord got up again and roared, while Guile and Scott laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No way. Then let's do it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's not much power, but it's better than nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just like this, with the idea of resignation, the three men decided to fight for the sake of the teenager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[The Ogma Familia] - participated in the battle. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Modi ...... and Magni." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Takemikazuchi reluctantly called out to the two pillar male gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,Take~. And Miach~" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  don't  even  have  to  guess,  it's  to  invite  us  to  join  the  faction  warlord  alliance, right~? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now that you know, don't ask anymore." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  chalk  tower  『Tower  of  Babel』,  the  thirtieth  floor  of  it.  The  meeting  of  the gods around the form of the war games and the detailed rules was being held for an unknown number of times, while Takemikazuchi and the others were walking around in the meeting and making conversation with other gods. To add as many companions as possible and help Hestia. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p60"></a>Miach responded with a sigh, and Modi and Magni, who were sitting in a corner of the round table seats, then showed a bad smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both  had  earth-colored  hair  and  eyes,  as  well  as  what  could  be  called  a  stout figure. The features are rightfully generally straight. However, like other gods, the vulgar smile that was always on their faces ruined everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two pillars of the group of gods who often play with themselves as toys, frankly speaking, Takemikazu (Takemikazuchi) did not want to get involved with them at all, and he frowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Which side are you going to take? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's the obvious question, isn't it? I'm on Hestia's side." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We  are  also.  This  time,  we  must  help  Bell  to  make  up  for  what  we  did  to  him before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After he said the unanimous opinion of the faction valve together with Miach, the two Modi really showed frivolous smiles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's what I said." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Loki  has  decided  not  to  participate,  but  Hephaestus  there  still  has  to  appear.  I don't know how the distribution of power will change now, and the gods are not sure of their attitude yet. ...... However, this is also limited to neutral guys. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modi nodded, Mandy added to explain the current situation. The two of them are the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And then what? What are your plans? Participate in the battle? Or watch from the sidelines?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I would be grateful if you would just promise not to interfere with us, no, not to interfere with Hestia and the girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Miach cut to the chase like that, Modi curled his lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mandy, on the other hand, spoke up for him and said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miach~. And Takemikazuchi~. Do you know why the meeting took so long? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the divine council held for days, the progress of deciding the details of the war game was quite, quite uneventful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gods, who love festivals and hate boring things, basically decided on the spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If it's interesting, they get involved. That's how they and they usually are. Even if this time is not the first time in the history of Orario's 'war of the faction', so far even the  form  of  the  decision  has  not  been  decided,  this  situation  would  have  been impossible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... isn't it because you guys are talking nonsense and slowing down the progress of the Divine Assembly? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hehehe. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p61"></a>Seeing Takemikazuchi frowning, Modi and the others did not hide their despicable smiles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Above the round table, the voices of the gods danced back and forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  mainly  the  goddesses  who  proposed  conditions  that  were  favorable  to Hestia and the girls, and then the male gods dismissed them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This tug-of-war has been repeated hundreds and thousands of times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia, who was present early in the morning, also actively expressed her opinion, but  was  ignored  magnificently,  so  she  angrily  shouted  "What  do  you  mean  by ignoring the people involved, you bastards-? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're Freya's 'resonators' too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You should call us supporters (fans). </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After all, we've been taken care of by Freya-sama. Even at a time like this, we want to help her, or maybe that's what makes it all the more important ...... Anyway, it's easy to hold on to when you're down." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a well-known fact that many male gods of Orario are very partial to 『Megami (Freya)』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And for the sake of their beloved goddess, they sometimes take matters into their own hands and perform certain acts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is exactly the case today. They wanted to secretly support Freya. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Only this time, Freya has done something unforgivable. Don't you understand?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course I do. It's just that my love for Freya-sama is stronger than that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course, there's a little bit of 'if we work hard at this time, we might get a reward~' </p>
<p class="calibre1">and so on, but ...... in the end, we still want Freya-sama to remain a queen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modi and Magni showed a smile that was very different from the vulgar smile so far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Takemikazuchi sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's possible that all the male gods, except for some of the gods such as C, Miach, and Ganesha, are acting on the same principle as Magni and the other two gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  gods'  association  today  was  repeating  futile  discussions  every  day, epitomizing the struggle between "Hestia's side's forces" and "Freya's supporters". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We didn't want to get a particularly favorable condition for Freya-sama. I'm sure Freya-sama doesn't want that either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But, at least let's get a fair deal. Considering the difference in strength itself ......6:4 </p>
<p class="calibre1">or 7:3, with the allied forces taking the lion's share, that would satisfy us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, silly formats like the big appetite contest, we won't allow it in any case." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modi and Magni said alternately, almost as if they had a brotherly understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p62"></a>They  clearly  declared  that  this  was  the  point  of  compromise,  which  was  also  to keep Freya's reputation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The same goes for the Rocky thing. If the guild hadn't given that notice, we would have completely prevented that guy from participating in the war. No matter what Freya-sama says, we'll do it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah - I understand you -. Even if Loki joins, I will start civil unrest within the allied forces at the same time as the game begins. I'll have the Familiasmen (children) attack, attack Bell Cranel, and you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, it doesn't make sense at all, let alone be fair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Takemikazuchi and Miach stared at the faces of Modi and Magni who declared so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... What do you mean by 'reason'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kenyorei asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It is to see if it is Loki." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Modi asserted so succinctly and clearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Isn't ...... a little too extreme?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miach frowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's extreme? It's normal, isn't it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then Magni shrugged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hephaestus, forget it. After all, those guys are forgers, and once the fight starts, Hestia's group will be the center, and they'll be the ones in charge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But  not  Loki's  side.  If  Loki  is  involved,  then  everything  will  become  a  Loki  duel (thing)." </p>
<p class="calibre1">「「......」」 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both Takemikazuchi and Miach were speechless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  command,  tactics,  battle  power,  all  will  be  colored  by  Loki.  The  center  or whatever  is  just  a  decoration.  It's  no  longer  a  'faction-led  coalition  army  led  by Hestia', but a 'faction-led coalition army robbed by Loki'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--Then it would be better to play war games with Loki from the beginning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--Besides, it would be a mere lynching, which is still a duel? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modi and Magni each added this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Takemikazuchi and Miach comprehended a point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if the guild does not take action, Loki can not participate in the war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The name of justice is important. However, we can't get the "main purpose" wrong, right?  After  all,  this  is  only  a  war  game  between  [Hestia's  Familia]  and  [Freya's Familia]. The other large group of allied forces must participate by joining Hestia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their claim was very correct. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p63"></a>The goddesses held a grudge against Freya, who had been the absolute queen, and they tried every way to drive her out of the city, but the gods, who knew the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"love" of the goddess of beauty, resolutely refused to let that happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... So, are you going to stand by Freya and the girls? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of  course  not.  Of  course  not.  That  said,  it's  not  possible  at  all.  After  all,  this  is Freya-sama's wish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  believers  (us)  are  trying  to  make  sense  of  the  battle,  but  that's  about  it.  If anyone tries to say, 'Let's fight with Freya-sama,' they won't be kicked out, they'll be beaten up on the spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When she declared that she wanted to play war games, Freya-sama had already decided to fight on her own. The only thing we can't touch is the goddess' reserve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modi and Magni finally put on a serious look befitting a god and concluded thus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Takemikazuchi and Miach did not say anything. At the same time, there is a new understanding of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modi and the others also had something called faith in their hearts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's right, so we were going to watch from the sidelines - but that foolish person Dormul~~~! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  Luvis  I  have  here  are  also  saying  "Now  it's  time  to  repay  the  favor  to  Bell Cranel! But he didn't listen to me at all! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in the next instant, Magni and Modi threw away that seriousness completely again and cried out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"They still hold a grudge against little Eina for that time we fooled them! The Lord God (us) has advised them many times, but they don't listen to us! They even said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who will listen to you? !" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oooh ~~~~~~~~, stupid Luvis ~~~~! You silly son~~~!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the bawling two pillars of male gods, Modi and Magni, who just now had a serious face, both cast a speechless gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's over-! Our [Familia] is finished-! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's all your own fault ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The [Takemikazuchi], [Miach Familia], [Modi Familia], and [Magni Familia] - joined the battle. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Those shitty male gods! They're just messing up for me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's time to form a goddess alliance! Now is the time to bring down the punishment on that hated Freya! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Somewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p64"></a>Every night after the divine meeting, the gods, wrapped in black cloaks, would talk loudly in the strange meeting hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Demeter's side is not going to work! That guy's faction is in a lot of trouble and is very vulnerable right now, not to mention that she and Freya are still close! He's the only one who would invite Freya to the sacred baths! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not to mention, that boob!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ahhh, those big boobs! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's unforgivable to be that big! So not our companion!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's the thing, Hathor! You take the lead!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, no, no, no, no, no. Why-" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The person they were talking to was the goddess Ichiban. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She has long black hair and fair skin, earrings and necklace made of figs, and a face that is partially covered by a cow mask. The height of 15.5C, taller than the young goddess (Hestia). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl with the masked face and the appearance of a young girl is Hathor. She is a pillar goddess who sits at the "Tower of Plenty" in the "Goddess Festival", and there is a rumor among the male gods that she actually has the strongest maiden motherhood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are a god of abundance like Demeter and Freya! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ishtar, the vanguard of the anti-Freya push, has disappeared, and now you are the only one who can take on this responsibility! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But I don't think the god of beauty (Freya) is hateful. And my fecundity is just a feeling like a bonus-" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hathor lounged on the bench and refused, but the goddesses did not rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Before that, you said, "The reverse harem is unforgivable," and "I'll show you what the real reverse harem is like! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's just a matter of wording." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't be silly, you're the one...!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ouch, hey... Oooh wow what are you guys doing stop- ahhhhhh -----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The League of Goddesses - Engage in war. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Time passes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gods' meetings were held every day, and the discussions were still not over, and  a  hazy  feeling  of  unease  began  to  well  up  in  the  hearts  of  the  people  who could only look up at the huge chalk tower. Even the people of the guild could only wait for the gods to make a decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p65"></a>During this time, more people did decide to participate in the war, and their names were recorded on top of the faction valve alliance. Looking at the list of outstanding combatants, the opinion of "maybe there is a chance" began to arise among the guild staff. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No way. We're going to lose." </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">A week after the announcement of the war game by the god of beauty, Hermes sat down on his butt in a chair that night. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was in the God's room, the base of the [Hermes Familia]. Just returned from the divine meeting,  he casually threw the parchment in his  hand onto the table, and Asfi, who had been waiting for his return, did not immediately make a sound when he saw the main god in this state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Is it too early to draw a conclusion? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not at all early. Hestia, the girls and Bell will lose. Definitely." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words that Asfi said with a stiff expression were forced back by Hermes' faint words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This has nothing to do with how much battle power has been gathered. There is no point in fighting against the battle force (Loki) without it. Waging war against Freya-sama, that's all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At least if little Ace can become a companion, then there will be a little chance of winning, although also and gravel so small is it ...... but this is also by Freya-sama shot to stop. Under these conditions, it is now a complete deadlock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  neither  resignation  nor  looking  away,  but  the  voice  of  the  gods  who  see everything clearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  word  "condition"  caused  Asfi's  eyebrows  to  knit  in  surprise,  and  she  asked again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then what are we [Hermes Familia] going to do ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As soon as one member of the group joins, the faction valve will be considered as joining the allied forces. After Freya-sama won alone, in order to maintain her relationship with Bell-kun forever, she would have put "collars" on all the gods she defeated, leaving no one behind. Only this one won't work, I want to avoid it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!  How  can  you  avoid  it  now  after  the  sacrifice  you  made  at  the  time  of  ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hakodate"? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God (I) am not a hero. This is not even a gamble, and I'm not going to kill myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p66"></a>"However, Aisha probably can't stop it anyhow ...... but after all, she belongs to the fake faction valve (Plutos' side) in the guild that's not much." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Asfi's faint accusation, Hermes shrugged his shoulders like an old man moving his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the main god, the act of 'self-preservation' that puts the safety of the [familia members] in the first place is very correct, and Asfi could neither seize this matter and not let go, nor could he blame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If there is anything that can reverse this result, it is ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gods' whispers were so soft that they could only be heard by pricking up their ears, and the follow-up of the words did not appear as a sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  if  even  optimistic  thoughts  were  to  be  forbidden,  Hermes  never  spoke  the subsequent words again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I ...... only this time, want to fight with them." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Asfi, on the other hand, spoke frankly from his heart, so frankly that even he felt perverse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's not because I have feelings for Hestia and the girls as well as Bell Cranel and them. But ...... since I heard Leon's 『wish』, then at least until she comes back, I want to help-" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, Hermes, who had closed his eyes to listen to her, raised his palm forward and interrupted the familia member's determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The expression on his face showed that he had understood her feelings, but the words that were about to be spoken still depressed him a little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm  sorry,  [the  Almighty]  is  forbidden  to  appear.  You  were  named  at  the  divine meeting." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing this unexpectedly strict order, Asfi's "Sh! His eyes widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why is that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was just about to shout like that when Hermes handed over the parchment he had thrown on the table earlier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the 『decision』 written on it, Asfi held her breath. </p>







<p class="calibre1"><a id="p67"></a>"Welf ...... are you okay?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ahhh ........................ no, I'm not fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the living room of the base, seeing that it took a while for Welf to answer him, Bell couldn't help but sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  it  was  night,  and  even  the  remnants  of  the  evening  sun  had  completely disappeared into the west. I don't know how long it had been since we last met, but the young forger's face and body were now completely covered by the shadow of fatigue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's the first time I've built so many 『Magic Swords』...... don't even have the time to disgust myself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">His cheeks faded, and his voice was hoarse as if his throat had dried up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As far as Bell knew, for him day and night has been taken for granted, these days he never steps out of the workshop. Obviously not exploring the labyrinth, but Welf drank up the recovery potion, the sight of this posture, Bell could not help but sweat cold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In  order  to  know  when  the  war  game  will  start,  everyone  is  doing  their  best  to prepare  and  countermeasure.  It's  better  to  say  that  it's  uncomfortable  to  do nothing ....... It's absolutely impossible ....... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lilly who said this also had heavy dark circles under her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sitting on the bench, leaning against each other is life and Haruhime, the two have a dull expression, which is the aftermath of mental fatigue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had been pushing themselves to improve their "magic" accuracy and "magic power"  ability  value.  In  order  to  take  revenge  on  the  [Freya's  Familia]  group members who had a level difference, they could only rely on this "magic" that was both an ace and a sure kill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, the schedules of several people coincided with this, and they were together in  the  living  room  of  the  base  for  a  long  time,  but  there  was  no  follow-up conversation. Everyone's body and mind were thirsty for rest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even so, it was hard for them to let go of their consciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The heartbeat in their chests was like a  manifestation of themselves, spreading this fierce aura throughout their bodies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  uneasiness  and  nervousness  that  had  been  removed  from  the  feeling  of exuberance - the [familia] that had been given the name of 'strongest' - took away all of Bell's optimism. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now if they don't do what they can, they can't even maintain a stable spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Are you okay too, Bell? Look at you all bruised up." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p68"></a>Welf looked over, and Bell scratched his cheek with his fingers, showing a bitter smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  body,  whether  it  is  exposed  skin,  or  under  the  clothes,  all  are  newly  added wounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is an essential 'ritual', but also 'price'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is the 'adjustment' to make the 'vessel' and the 'heart' become one with the help of the helpers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Everyone has been working on it. Many people have lent a helping hand. ...... I want to win. ...... must win. I still want to stay in the [Hestia familia] -) Bell looked out at Welf and their stance and chanted so in his heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( - Most importantly, to bring that person -) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he looked beyond the window and gazed at the bitterly cold sky that seemed to reveal the heart of the Queen of Winter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He quietly clenched his fist and reconfirmed the idea in his mind, and just then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's decided! It's decided!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beyond the room, the sound of the door opening boomed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first to react was Bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then Lily and Welf jerked back, followed by Mikoto and Haruhime who quickly got up from the bench. Bell was the first to rush out of the living room, followed by Lily and the girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The main god, whose fatigue level was not far behind theirs, tripped and fell on her feet,  and  the  dependents  just  ran  to  the  entrance  hall  before  she  used  her  last strength to peel her body off the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The details of the war games are decided!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">「「「「「!!! 」」」」」 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  whole  group  took  a  breath  backwards,  after  which  Bell  asked  on  behalf  of everyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kami-sama, then what is the way of the duel! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess stood up on Bell's hand and did not answer, but handed out the scroll that was clutched in her hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily scrambled to take it and spread it out, and Welf and the others looked over from the side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five  pairs  of  eyes  browsed  through  the  copula  dancing  on  the  parchment,  then arrived at one of the words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell and their eyes widened considerably, at which point Hestia said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The duel is, hide-and-seek - 'Seek the gods (Hide-and-Seek)'." </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p69"></a> </p>



<p class="calibre1">"The details of the war game were decided. Freya-sama." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aron's voice echoed in the god's room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya, who was on the recliner, took the paper that was respectfully handed to her and read it out quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The time is six days later, and the place is 『Orza City Ruins』...... is the place with 『God's House』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the goddess read it once, as if she lost interest, she burned the paper with the candle on the single-legged round table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The [Loki Familia] has also confirmed that they will not participate in the war. The guild has issued an official statement." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is that so? I thought the current Uranus would stop Royman ...... seems to have decided to stand by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To put it in an extreme way, it doesn't matter how. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen  was  making  a  statement,  while  the  frank  feeling  in  Freya's  heart  whose expression remained unchanged was so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  as  Hedin  said  to  Finn,  Freya  was  asking  for  war  games  with  the  idea  of provoking along with the [Loki Familia]. The divine will had been decided long ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She even felt that she and the Loki women were always referred to as 'urban twin-heads' and put together for comparison, so it was just right to have a showdown this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It doesn't matter who participates in the battle, only that the enemy needs to be crushed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole army of Orario was defeated in a dignified manner, and the desired item was obtained. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is Freya's posture as a queen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... I have a question, may I ask you to solve it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe that's why. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This 'contradiction' was pointed out by the familia members who understood the divine will of the Lord God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why do you want to keep [Sword Girl] away from that rabbit? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Freya who caused Ottar to contact Ace and bind her with the Oath Lock. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p70"></a>The will to fight the biggest enemy (Loki's familia) was so strong, yet she wanted to prevent a mere girl from getting involved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a very obvious 'contradiction'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words of Allen, who was kneeling on one knee, seemed to be reproaching the Queen (Freya) for her unlike choice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya paused for a moment and made a reply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You know very well the true nature of Bell's single-minded longing, don't you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm worried that after that child has exercised with [Sword Girl], he will grow even more drastically. Maybe he will grow in power more than the 'baptism' you gave him in this battle wilderness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  constructing  the  "Box",  she  shared  the  information  (skill)  that  Bell  could bounce off the "charm" with the dependents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On top of that, Freya talked about the real possibility. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you really think that such a degree will drive us into a desperate situation? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And this time, Allen's eyes really hung high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those  eyes were reminiscent of a fierce cat that would swing its claws  to harm even its master. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  will  send  you  anywhere,  clear  all  your  obstacles,  and  become  a  'chariot'  that belongs to you alone. I should have sworn that I gave up that 'chronic'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Are you going to insult my strength as a strong warrior and the oath of the past? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sharp tiger's teeth (fangs) were slightly exposed, and I asked this in secret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... This is to get the child without fail." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess' reply to the familia members was only a short sentence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside the window, the wavering clouds blocked the moonlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The frosty anger of Allen, who was staring at the main god, gradually dissipated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did not pursue the question and stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please forgive me for saying more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"With that, farewell." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The catman, like a loyal guard who never enters the Goddess' sanctuary, exited the divine chamber. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya was left alone in the sacred room, and she leaned her head against the back of the chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To get it without fail"? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was ridiculous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked up at the high ceiling and let out a snicker directed at herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p71"></a>"It's just ...... jealousy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wanted to keep the longing away from the teenager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't want Bell to be near Ace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This girlish and childish idea made Freya forbid [Sword Girl] to get involved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell and Ace had exercised on the huge walls of the city. She had seen it at the uppermost level of the 『Tower of Babel』 for an unknown number of times. The thought of such a rendezvous happening again made her feel as if something was stirring deep in her throat and the inside of her chest. It even brought her a pain that did not exist, as if a sword with a damaged and rusty blade was forcibly digging into her wound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before she could bear it. But, not anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The exclusive desire for the teenager was swelling, and the restraints that held it in check had been lifted. The out-of-control feelings were driving her 'character' - </p>
<p class="calibre1">the thing that made 'Mishin' what it was - to the front of the whirlpool of passion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now too, something seemed to be turning over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was as if it was really going to degenerate into a worthless, boring 'little girl'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ is miserable." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She softly said this unheard voice. </p>


<p class="calibre1">"Does Freya-sama not believe in us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the words of the four male Grer, the Gulliver brothers all looked over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Far away from the Goddess God's room on the highest floor, on the first floor of the "Battle Wasteland", "Sesrinir". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The warriors' dinner had ended, and the oversized hall looked quite empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  the  first  rank  adventurers  were  left  here  now,  and  their  voices  were  heard from every corner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why did you order Ottar to keep [Sword Girl] away? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To obtain victory without fail. That's all, what other reason could there be?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To be honest, it was unexpected. It was obvious that we would all be defeated, no matter who the enemy was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grer, Berling, and Duvalin said in turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  was  a  very  rare  scene.  The  brothers  who  normally  could  connect  in  their hearts even without saying a word were now asking and answering questions, as if they were constantly asking themselves. That is to say, they harbored questions about the Lord God in their hearts, as well as a hint of disbelief. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p72"></a>Three identical voices argued, trying to guess what was in Freya's heart, followed by </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't doubt Freya-sama. It goes against our loyalty." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfrigg, the eldest male, spoke up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At his words, Grer and the others shut their mouths. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The conclusion was obvious. No matter what doubts were in their hearts - although other  members  of  the  group  other  than  them  also  had  the  same  doubts  -  the ultimate goal was one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the sake of the goddess, [Freya's familia] will bet their lives to fight. That's all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can understand Freya-sama's feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A voice sounded softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only black elf other than the four brothers, Hogni, who was sitting with them, leaned against the table and hugged one knee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I hate it when things that I have my eye on are taken away from me ...... by others." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A hint of silence seeped out at the end of the voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The front of his sight is the seat where the teenager who is not here now used to sit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it was a false relationship, and the time spent together was definitely not long, but the black elf's eyes did have a lingering love for 『[Freya's familia]'s Bell Clunie』 in them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I so want to personally ...... cultivate Bell for a while ...... again instead of by [Sword Girl] ...... or whoever else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Compared to these tough warriors of his own, he doesn't have much talent to be right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also rejected by the world and locked into the 『Boxing』 where one would even doubt their own perception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he resisted the words of the god of beauty, "charm", and all kinds of harshness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To Hogni, who was afraid of touching others - even more so as an elf - that human was so intriguing, so new. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni lowered his eyes and said what was on his mind, when he was suddenly startled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He found the eyes of Alfrigg and the others focused on him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's quite a talk today." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And the way to talk is quite ordinary." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You usually say the same thing, don't you, fearful elf." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Hogni's words that he  understood without Hedin's translation, the prum said ""Why are you so sentimental?"" and attacked him mercilessly. Hogni, who </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p73"></a>instantly turned red in the face, "Aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa ......! He rolled his eyes and hastily raised the collar of his coat (cloak) to cover half of his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hegyi. It's your freedom to indulge in emotion, but when the time comes--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh,  don't  worry.  This  body  is  the  cold  servant  chosen  by  the  endless darkness ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The brothers sent a cold look, and Alfrigg issued a warning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni feigned calm with the usual twisted words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, he turned into the appearance of a cold warrior and declared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If we meet on the battlefield, we will slice him with this sword and break his limbs </p>
<p class="calibre1">- all for the sake of the goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya's Familia] will not be confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once on the battlefield, it is time to serve the Goddess with victory. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"I can't. I didn't wake up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice of a young girl rang out from the room on the west side of the fifth floor of "Battle Wasteland". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar, who had been listening to the report in silence, asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does that mean it's too late?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even I would be super angry, chief? Don't look at me like this, but as a therapist who always listens to outrageous requests, I still have the appropriate reserve." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Drip drip drip drip. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The therapist girl Haider narrowed her eyes and looked upwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Orta's rock-like majestic expression didn't move at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, unlike that serious expression, the pig ears on his head bent a little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottarh was not good at dealing with this therapist girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be precise, he felt guilty for throwing all the 'baptism' of the corps members who fought each other every day in the 'battle wilderness' to Haider and their full-Bellied cinderellas. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haider is an excellent healer, and therefore forced to take over the heavy workload, she is very resentful of Ottar, Ottar himself knows very well that he has not done a thing  like  the  head.  Therefore,  in  the  super  strength  supremacist  faction  valve (Freya familia) is very rare, a healer and Lv. 7 leader's position perfectly inverted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even in the face of the first level adventurer, Haider still gave her opinion without fear, she looked at the giant pig man who did not say a word like a child who was ignoring people, and with a sigh, she continued to report. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have tried all means. The wound has been plugged and the flesh and blood has returned to its previous state after the response magic was used to vomit. There </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p74"></a>is also breathing and pulse. Originally I should not be able to wake up. ...... But, just do not open your eyes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... also means fainting state? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As a therapist, it's hard for me to accept that word to describe her right now ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">but it is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After saying that, Haider looked down at the bed beside him together with Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're a ...... troublesome woman. Horn." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one lying on the bed was a young girl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goddess attendant" Horn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, her appearance today was not the well-known face of the head of the Goddess of Beauty (Freya) attendant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The light gray hair that was not tied up and flowed down to her shoulders. Ottar they knew that in the tightly closed eyelids were pupils of the same color as the hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This gesture was exactly the same as the street maiden known as 『Hir-Floyd』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic that Horn possessed [Warner Seid]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only secret magic in the lower realm can make her change into a god perfectly and  become  the  same  goddess  Freya  except  for  her  "divine  power".  With  this power, the current Horn became one of Freya's 'faces', that is, Syr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Leaking  the  truth  to  Bell  and  then  ending  yourself  ......  I  can't  understand  at  all what it is that would make you go out of your way to betray Freya-sama. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What is surprising is that in the middle of the 『Box Court』 built by Freya, Horn not  only  broke  the  taboo  and  contacted  Bell,  but  even  revealed  her  own relationship with the goddess (Freya), and the girl (Syr). </p>
<p class="calibre1">It can also be said that it was she who destroyed Freya's 'box court'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At least in the opinion of Haider and the girls. This treachery spread throughout the faction  valve,  and  if  it  wasn't  for  the  master's  order,  the  members  of  the  group would  have  turned  the  young  girl  into  a  corpse  without  hesitation.  Even  Haider, who has worked together for a long time and knows a lot, was not an exception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For a moment, the young girl who only offered her loyalty to the goddess looked down at Horn's pupils with a cold glow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  seemed  ready  to  reach  out  and  strangle  the  slender  neck  of  the  sleeping maiden,  and  Ottar  watched  the  expressionless  side  of  her  face,  at  which  point Haider closed her eyes and sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......  Following  the  divine  will  of  Freya-sama,  I  sustained  her  life.  But  that's  all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Incompetent as I am, I cannot do anything further than that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haider's voice resounded through the wide chamber. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p75"></a>It was an elegant white room that did not fit in with the 'sinners' who betrayed the goddess, and there  was only one bed in the room. In a sacred atmosphere like that  of  the  church,  it  was  reminiscent  of  the  crevice  between  heaven  and  earth where souls wandered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The box-shaped bed where the maiden was sleeping also looked like a coffin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  there  were  flowers  underneath,  I'm  afraid  anyone  would  believe  she  was  a corpse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like a character in a fairy tale, the girl who was once called "Syr" had been sleeping here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you know why she doesn't wake up? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can only speculate from the perspective of someone who is not a god ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter, Ottar urged her to continue with her sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The first possibility that came to mind was Horn's own refusal to wake up. It was obvious  from  the  planned  suicide  that  she  believed  she  had  sinned  and  was ashamed of Lord Freya. If the spirit wishes to sleep forever, there is no point in healing the physical body any further. ............ then again" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haider recounted her hypothesis, at which point she paused for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a long hesitation, she turned it into words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Perhaps  she  is  now  maintaining  the  『Syr-sama』  that  Freya-sama  wants  to bury ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, even Ottar shut her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What Horn hurt was her own (Horn's) body. Not the flesh of the gods. But now, the crisis of the flesh itself no longer exists. Although the consciousness is severed, the only secret law is not lifted at all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then, it can only be assumed that Horn has been maintaining the magic, in order not to lose 『something』 ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having said that, after some time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haider shook his head feebly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「This is just my speculation, it's all just some boring jokes. Please forget about it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... ah ah." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar answered the young girl perfunctorily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(What only the girl (Horn) can understand, the inner thoughts of the goddess ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">or rather, something that the lord didn't even notice.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are times when the feelings of the goddess flow backwards to Horn along the connection [Warner Seid]. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p76"></a>Ottar had heard Freya say so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What was the girl (Syr) with her eyes tightly closed thinking  about and why she kept sleeping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The man could not understand her 'expectations' until the end - and never tried to understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because for the martial artist (Ottar), all he could do was fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because for the strongest (Ottar), all he had to do was to crush the enemies of the goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, he knew very well that he was not qualified, but he still spoke out and asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What kind of 'dream' are you having, right now?" </p>
