<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 9: I'll give you flowers: </h1>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/SB8FYPq/171988.jpg" alt="171988" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1">I'm sorry, Anya. </p>

<p class="calibre1">I'm sorry, Chloe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">I'm sorry, Runoa. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sorry, Ryu. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sorry ...... Mia. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p184"></a> </p>


<p class="calibre1">"............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya, sitting on her stone throne, closed her eyes tightly and furrowed her brow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She put one hand against her forehead, unpleasant feelings seeping out from the list  of  words  echoing  directly  in  her  head  and  the  voice  that  sounded  one  after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Are you dreaming again?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">A man and a woman who acted as escorts around her peered at her worriedly, but now even responding to them felt troublesome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dead girl (Syr) - no, the other girl (Horn) was looking at the "dream". </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  help  of  『Transformation  Magic』  only  secret  method  (Warner  Saide), Freya  and  Horn  would  share  five  senses.  Horn  was  still  in  a  state  of unconsciousness  from  the  initiation  of  magic,  so  Freya  would  feel  the  "dream world" she saw from time to time like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The vision was still dark. But her 『apology』 was echoing in her hearing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On Horn's side, 'emotional reflux' occurs when the goddess gets emotional, but it is not possible for this to happen on Freya's side. Freya was not aware of Horn's thoughts  and  ideas,  but  only  received  the  'information'  that  came  through.  And now, it was a 'murmur' that was particularly unpleasant to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Horn chased after the goddess' emotions and said these 『apologies』 in her own dreams, then Horn could be considered as Freya's mirror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She even fished up the residual thoughts of the girl Freya should have killed and put them in broad daylight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(What an ugly mirror ......) </p>
<p class="calibre1">If even the 『dreams』 seen in the abyss of slumber were a collection of memories and  emotions,  then  Freya  couldn't  peer  into  Horn's  dreams.  She  knew  that  the vision was blocked, dimmed, and the young girl was still sleeping. The touch of liquid came from her cheek, probably tears running down from her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya  had  long  since  stopped  caring  about  the  war  games  whose  trend  was  a foregone conclusion, and she suppressed the sound that rang out from the inside of her body as if she had an unbearable headache - and just then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya jerked her body to her feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She moved so swiftly that she acted nothing like a queen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The guards were taken aback, while she opened her silver pupils wide. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p185"></a>"...... F, Freya-sama?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's wrong with you--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tell Hedin to get it over with." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess's voice interrupted the two men's questions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked at the familia members who had stopped moving with a sharp gaze and ordered so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Pass on my command to end this war game immediately! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, yes, yes! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Lord God had hardly ever shouted like this, and the two guards, a man and a woman, held their breath and their bodies trembled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  two  men  rushed  out  of  the  House  of  God  in  unison  and  headed  to  the commander's side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside  the  now  empty  temple,  the  goddess  sitting  back  on  her  throne  took  on  a slightly anxious expression on her face for the first time. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"End it as soon as possible?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin turned back to them and asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, that's right. That's what Freya-sama ordered Hedin-sama to do." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All of a sudden, they said they would finish off the faction warlords ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin stared intently at the expressions of the two guards who had rushed from the Lord God's side to deliver the order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  obvious  that  seeing  Freya's  sudden  change,  they  themselves  were  very alarmed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, this was really the 『Goddess' divine will』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a change of heart in "her"  heart that forced her to give a strict order from the gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin quietly narrowed his eyes in the depths of his glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... knows. I will order the whole army. As for that stupid cat and the other cadres, Rask and Remilia, you go directly to relay it. If I order them to suddenly change their course, those idiots will definitely be suspicious and not comply." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Got it, got it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then as the commander quickly began to move, compiled individual instructions to the first level adventurers and handed them over to these two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A male and a female member of the group that came from Freya's side didn't get tired  of  having  to  run  errands,  and  the  two  ran  towards  the  『main  battlefield』 </p>
<p class="calibre1">where the faction valve allied forces were still resisting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hyuk-din silently watched their backs, then raised his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p186"></a>"All  troops,  start  attacking  now!  The  position  of  the  main  camp  also  advances forward! Move quickly, this is the will of the Goddess!!!" </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Did you say 'attack forward'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen, who had stabbed another forger with a high-speed gun technique, raised his eyebrows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The female member of the group who came panting as "Crozzo's Magic Sword" </p>
<p class="calibre1">fell to the top of the stone slab nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, that's right ...... the whole army is going to start attacking! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  thought  we  were  going  to  completely  crush  the  enemy's  strength  here.  What does that maggot mean, changing course now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's not Hedin-sama, it's Freya-sama's instructions! She said to quickly decide the winner!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aron was more defiant as expected, and the female group member threw the pre-prepared answer straight over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After hearing it, Allen, whose expression was tinged with murder, also twisted his eyebrows into a shape of surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What ......? Is this true?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, Rask and I heard it with our own ears. Freya-sama gave the order in a rather heavy tone ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Coincidentally,  Aron  and  and  Hedin  stared  closely  at  the  faces  of  the  group members who deliberated their words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rask  and  Remilia  had  been  selected  beforehand  as  guards  to  guard『God's House』.  Since  they  were  the  ones  who  said  it,  there  was  no  doubt  that  it  was Freya's  divine will. Originally, the fact that they were  not  at the final base camp where the main god was guarding, but had run away instead, could be called an unusual  development.  If  it  had  been  Hedin's  instructions  -  provided  it  was something  he  was  not  used  to  seeing  -  Allen  would  have  refused,  but  if  it  was Freya's wish, then it was different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He resisted the urge to smack his lips and quickly looked around with his sharp cat eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The battle was a foregone conclusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The victory had been decided, and the faction valve alliance would have no chance of winning no matter what they did. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, even if the goddess' divine will was followed, there was nothing wrong with dialing the needle a little faster. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p187"></a>The  first  rank  adventurer  of  『Metropolis  Fastest』  frowned  and  approved  the decision of the base camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......  Follow  that  maggot's  combat  and  disengage  from  the  enemy's  right  flank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gather up the idle guys!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The female corps members gradually went away, and Allen ended the annihilation of the enemy's magic sword unit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  attack  by  the  free  and  unpredictable  Allen  led  to  the  destruction  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Hephaestus  Familia]  forgers  and  the  adventurers  with  the  "Crozzo's  Magic Sword". The "Magic Sword" was no longer a threat. Allen stomped on the hand of the  forger  that  left  the  ground  and  rolled  down  to  the  longsword  type  『Magic Sword』 in front of him, and turned his toes to the right flank of the allied forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「............ hoo-, hoo-! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get out of the way, big guy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A bloodied Dormul braced his hands on the ground and stood up in front of Allen's eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  ex-shield  job  dwarf  who  had  been  breached  by  the  assault  of  the  tough warriors, trampled, and hit here by Hedin's barrage racked his weapon, thinking to at least stop the first level adventurers from going to choke off the last breath of the allied forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't </p>
<p class="calibre1">even </p>
<p class="calibre1">think </p>
<p class="calibre1">about </p>
<p class="calibre1">going </p>
<p class="calibre1">through! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The armor full of cracks fell from his body, blood splashed in all directions, aimed at the catman and swung his war hammer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  the  expression  rippled  Allen  did  not  even  get  a  drop  of  flying  blood,  not  to mention the war hammer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  moved  noiselessly  and  passed  by  Dormul,  dismantling  the  weapon  and  the dwarf's steel body in all its glory. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The dwarf sank into the earth with a boom, but never drew Allen's attention again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now the 'chariot' had received the order to turn the wheel and would not care about a mere adventurer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Follow me, you slowpokes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  that  the  army  had  already  assembled,  the  chariot  began  its  relentless </p>
<p class="calibre1">『invasion』. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p188"></a>『Ah ............ hey ----- ----- ah! Freya's Familia] invasion! Freya's Familia] invasion ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iltae made his first decent broadcast today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had only shouted at the very beginning when the 『Magic Sword』 started its barrage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After that, he was silenced by the successive ravages of the [Freya's Familia] side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with the miserable battle situation where there was no point in broadcasting and commentary, he could only shut his mouth like the audience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now, he was finally able to shout out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  also  meant  that  [Freya's  Familia]  wanted  to  end  this  duel  on  their  own initiative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The troops led by [Goddess Chariot] left from the right flank of the faction valve alliance and instantly moved east!!! The obvious target was the main base of the allied army with the empty gate wide open, the Eastern Domain of the Ruins ------</p>
<p class="calibre1">-- --!!!' </p>
<p class="calibre1">The loud volume of the broadcast, as well as the great change in the battle situation caused the people of Orario to gradually clamor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Receiving instructions from Freya as well as Hedin, the tough warriors assembled on the north side of the 『Main Battlefield』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen was at the forefront, dashing towards the north side of the island in a line with a speed that would be considered unusually swift by the average person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh-huh ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily watched the enemy shadows pass through her vision one after another, but there was nothing she could do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They ran in a big circle around the huge tomb in the center of the west side of the town seat island and broke through the right flank troops that were in a state of destruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haruhime and other reserves in "Transparent State" went to the left flank of Aisha and her troops who were still holding on hard, to support them, but now it backfired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen,  no  it  was  the  enemy  commander  (Hedin)  who  accurately  grasped  the formation  that  Lily  had  constructed,  and  in  one  fell  swoop,  penetrated  the  right flank that had become weak and vulnerable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With no more cards to play and no army to use, Lily could only watch the enemy march  from  the  roof  of  the  tomb,  while  Allen  and  the  others  ignored  her  as  the commander and went to split the victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This happened in a flash, as swift as a whirlwind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p189"></a>The invasion force led by the chariot easily crossed the central dividing line and invaded the eastern part of the urban ruins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Enemy troops went to their own positions ......! --Hestia-sama, run!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">This also meant going to destroy those main gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily's scream drifted in all directions along the eye crystals equipped for the major gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia and the girls stared in shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait, wait ah ah! I want to surrender ----!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We are the companions of the god of beauty (Freya)! Do you understand? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So noisy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first two gods to be instantly killed were Magni and Modi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The male gods lurking in the crumbling ruins raised their hands in surrender, but they still rolled to the ground due to the flash of Aron's speeding wind pressure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tip of the silver spear just cut through the『flower』that was stuck in the chest of the gods, and the red and orange petals flew everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Magni, Modi, two families! Out!!!'' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately afterwards, the gods who were out of the game for the first time in the game were judged to be unable to continue by Orario's Ibri. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  main  deity  without『Flower』was  out,  which  led  to  the  withdrawal  of  the dependents as well, and this was the condition of the war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Modi and Magni's [dependents], that is, Luvis the elfs and Dormul the dwarves, will lose the right to fight and have the obligation to leave the island quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, compared to the speed of the dependents leaving the island, the speed of breaking the gods was even faster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Scatter! There are several of them in the surrounding ruins!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Understood! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Found! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"---Ungaahhhhh!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon hearing Allen's instructions, the group members dispersed at the same time and searched for the gods on the side of the allied forces one after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen  and  other  strong  warriors  with  excellent  five  senses  of  orcs  accurately revealed where the gods were lurking. The momentum of the speeding did not stop at all, turning the whole ruins upside down, and this situation was like a storm that was just as electric as it could be. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p190"></a>The  inhabitants  of  the  city  were  looking  down  on  the  battlefield  from  multiple viewpoints through the "Mirror of God", but their eyes still couldn't keep up with the attack. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"[Oogma Familia], out! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ilta, on the other hand, could barely keep up with the dynamic vision of the upper level adventurers, so only his broadcast was reading out the names of the gods and faction warlords who were gradually getting out in turn. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"[Selkhet Familia], out! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... is really no good." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Sumo Familia], out! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "flowers" of the gods were all scattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inside the ruins, in the shadow of the stone pillar, in the pot. The location of the male gods whose hiding places were sometimes very odd was exposed, and the chest of the goddess who was desperately running around was mercilessly sliced open. The resistance of the dependents who stayed behind as guards was also useless. Sorry,  Liliruca Arde - even a low murmur of worrying about the former dependents would be covered and buried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chief  Shakti,  the  Meishin  dependents  (Freya  dependents)  are  just  too  fast!  It's simply impossible to withdraw all the allied adventurers!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't force it! Be careful not to interfere with the battle and prioritize pulling out the seriously wounded!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gods were getting out one by one, while the dependents were very slow to disengage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were only a handful of adventurers still standing on two feet - still conscious </p>
<p class="calibre1">- and fighting, and most of them lost their strength and sank into the earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As referees, the [Ganesha Families] who were on standby at various edges of the island  managed  to  move  the  adventurers  who  could  not  disengage  themselves outside as far as they could visually see the gods out. Among them were also the unconscious Luvis, Mord, and Dormul in their figures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hestia! Get out of here!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You said, "Where are you going to escape ......? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The east side of the island is no longer viable! Run to the front!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  eastern  part  of  the  ruins  where  the  Familia  of  Freya  is  approaching,  the reaction of the gods is divided into two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Continue to lurk (hide-and-seek), or run away in desperation (ghost capture). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p191"></a>Hephaestus,  who  was  hiding  with  Hestia  in  one  of  the  ruins,  chose  the  method called 'Izumo' in the board game of the Far East. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Desperately run there! Run to the place where the children are on the west side! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if you are the only one left, you must join them! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then, what are you going to do, Hephaestus? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll go somewhere else! If we don't split up, we'll get caught in a net! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You  and  I  have  Lv.5  familia  members,  one  of  us  has  to  survive!  If  both  sides retreat, there will really be no chance of winning this war game! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hephaestus turned into a dictator and blocked Hestia's retort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had also sensed it. The reaction of the commander (Lily) ringing in the crystal made her notice that Tsubaki had fallen. Noticing that her dependents were in a state of destruction. So for the sake of Hestia, she intended to become 'bait'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The situation was so bad that the gods wanted to give up their resistance, but even so, she didn't want to cut off the chance of victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go while Takemikazuchi is doing something! Hurry up!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Sorry!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Propelled by Hephaestus' loud shout, Hestia rushed out of the relic where she was hiding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--- Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gooaaaahhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go, go, go, go, go, go! All together! </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were very few people who were able to resist the attackers of the familia of the God of Beauty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be exact, there was only one pillar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After using "Strategy" to lure the opponent to aim at the "Flower" in the chest, and then using "Technique" to wrap around the arm, "Mushijin" performed a backdrop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  speed  in  his  own  physical  ability  (ability  value)  was  utilized,  and  a  strong warrior who was thrown away smashed  into the ground and lost consciousness from  the  strong  impact.  The  orc  captain  gave  the  order,  and  the  tough  warriors pounced on Ken-Oh-Rei, who was sweating like rain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo--? </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  the  Mushain's  struggle  became  futile,  defiant  shouts  and  the  orc  captain's outstretched arm snatched the purple chrysanthemum from his chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... sorry, Hestia, Hephaestus ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p192"></a>Large sweat kept falling to the top of the stone slab, frowning Takemikazuchi tilted his head to look at the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The orc who had snatched the 『Flower』 used up all his strength and fell to the ground, Miach familiamaround him, twenty-one strong warriors also fell there in a similar position. A little further outside, there were the unconscious, the Mushijin guards (dependents) other than Ouka and Chigusa. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  strongest  faction  of  the  warriors  (Freya's  Familia)  had  suffered  the  most serious damage that day, the loss of one of their troops, under the Mushijin who had taken revenge for an arrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hathor! Leave this place to us, you run away!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The Goddess Alliance is indestructible as long as the Alliance Master (you) is still alive! Never mind the sacrifice of my concubines! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, yes..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the easternmost side of the island, the Goddess Alliance, which had taken over the ruins of the military fortress, had also made a move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing the terrifyingly tough warriors who were about to come - taking advantage of their inability to kill the gods (acting haphazardly) - the goddesses became meat shields, while Hathor, a pillar of gods (alone), quickly escaped from the citadel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, that was the end of the resistance of the faction valve alliance. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"『[Ares Familia], out! </p>

<p class="calibre1">The attack was too swift. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"[Takabayashi Familia], out! </p>

<p class="calibre1">Each faction was helpless and fell, and the names of the factions were read out one after another without stopping. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"The names of the factions were read out one after another without stopping at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Naderi Familia] ...... is out ......! </p>

<p class="calibre1">Iltae's tone also gradually lost its momentum, and gradually froze along with his face. </p>

<p class="calibre1">『【Hephaestus Familia】...... out, out ......! ......』 </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p193"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the expressionless Allen a gun cut 『flower』, forging God as if to kill this regret, closed the left eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pai valve allied army, the largest force out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  caused  the  morale  of  the  allied  army,  as  well  as  the  energy  of  the  urban audience to fall to the bottom of the abyss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The United Faction Warlords, the remaining forces, four faction warlords. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of the as many as forty-six united faction valves, forty-two [dependents] were out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  march  of  Allen  and  others  ruthlessly  ravaged  the  entire  eastern  part  of  the ruins, and this invasion even reached the easternmost part. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Big, big brother ...... Hestia-sama ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The orphanage in Labyrinth Street (Daedalus Street). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Human teenager Lai's voice choked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Big brother Bell, plus, plus ...... ooooooooooooooooooooooo ......!!! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lu ....... Don't cry ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Half elf Lu refueling plus halfway to cry out, with the orc Fina also began to cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The mother (Maria) herself was dumbfounded and could only hold these children tightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The children's reaction was very frank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were more honest than the adults, and the table was most realistic in showing the desperation of the faction's allied forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--The end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone has given up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gave up on winning this war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone had no doubt that it was an overwhelming victory for [Freya's Families]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was also the inevitable end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The adventurers who stayed in the city slumped their shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gods murmured in loneliness that this was the only way to go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both the battlefield and the city were ruled by resignation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the one who is not resigned to fate is... </p>
<p class="calibre1">(- Ahhh, just as expected.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The commander who understands what the situation is like, but still maintains a balanced mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p194"></a>(Yes, it was expected to be this situation at the beginning ...... After all, considering the difference in battle power  between the enemy  and us, it's not normal  not to become like this ...... so, not yet ...... not yet to panic (The time ......!!!) The battle line has disintegrated, the pieces are almost completely destroyed, and the endgame (General) is coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  commander,  today  is  the  plate  that  will  be  most  denounced  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">『incompetent』,  but  Lily  has  exchanged  her  calmness  alone  with  a  few  sweat dripping down her cheeks as a price. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until a moment ago, she was torn apart and panicked because Bell was ravaged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily's own eyes are filled with tears, so I want to cry out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But ironically, the gods' "chirp eh-! or "chirp wah-la-ba-! Such as the disconnected cry of the gods through the eye crystals to Lily's ears, angry her forehead veins burst out. And Hestia "----! The cry finally provoked her to burst into a rage and let her anger dictate and hit her cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The taste of blood that came out of her wounded mouth was like an anesthetic that numbed Lily's emotions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"『Goo uh uh uh uh ............ ah ah ah ah ah ............! </p>
<p class="calibre1">What's more, </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the depths of the crystal, the『teenager』was still fighting... </p>





<p class="calibre1">"「Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh ............!!! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  sound  of  muscle  fibers  snapping  resounded  from  the  inside  of  his  body, convincing himself that it was an illusion, and braced his hands on the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  muscles  spilled  blood  everywhere.  The  bones  groaned  in  pain  from  the damage. The sound of screaming from inside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I can't. Can't win. Absolutely not. Let's run away. I don't want to do it again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The body and the spirit together launched a mournful cry of grievance - which was again firmly rejected by the will that clutched the Dagger of God (Hestia's Blade). </p>
<p class="calibre1">(No  more,  I  can't  take  it  anymore  ..................  don't,  fight  again  ......  ............  or something like that) </p>
<p class="calibre1">How long has it been since I've said such a complaint? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the day she met the heretics (Beni) and lost to her arch rival (Astros), Bell hadn't said anything discouraging since. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p195"></a>It  was  the  same  when  he  fell  into  the  "Deep".  It  was  the  same  when  he  was imprisoned in the "box" of the god of beauty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  matter  how  desperate  he  was,  even  if  the  thought  of  resignation  flashed through  his  mind,  Bell  thought  strongly,  "How  can  I  give  up?  He  resisted  like  a child's capriciousness and finally gave up the thought of weakness. I will never turn the discouraging words into sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From  the  day  he  met  the  "Heretic",  Bell  Cranel  must  have  been  broken somewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was an "abnormality" in his head, heart, or soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this "abnormality" was the condition and qualification that he had to have in order to become a so-called "hero", and he subconsciously understood this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The martial artist in front of him had restored such a Bell-Croix to "normal". </p>
<p class="calibre1">With his arm strength alone, and the weight contained in a blow, he made Bell fall back to the time when he was a "disgraced novice" who had a mental image of a fierce bull. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What a monster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What a freak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It can be said to be the 'strongest'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stronger than anyone else's power even turned the so-called 'hero alternate' into a mundane baby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(So strong ............ so scary ............ can't win... .........!!!) How many times have you been knocked off your feet since then? What has been abused since then?  Don't know. And I don't want to understand. I don't want to think about whose blood is the bright red spring spreading outward nearby. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  world  whispered  to  me,  "You  are  "Bell  Clone  of  the  Familia  of  the  God  of Beauty"', and every day I experienced "Baptism" in that "Battle Wilderness" was no better than the current"Baptism ". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The level of pain, suffering, and hell is completely different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if you climbed to the peak where others would look pale, you would never be able to reach the thunder and lightning that rode in the sky. Even if you do reach it, you will definitely be burned by it, to the fate of extinction. The martial artist who is still looking down on Bell can be described as a surrogate for the thunder. For Bell, who can only control shabby fire and lightning so far, being devoured by it is a doomed end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">【Rabbit foot】Bell Cronin definitely can't win against 【Fierce One】Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(............ even so ............!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hands were trembling violently. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p196"></a>The knees are not obedient, like the newborn fawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even so, spitting blood clots, letting the flash explode in the field of vision, stripping the body to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of the "mirror", Eina, Ace, Tiona, Finn, Leigh, Fina, Lu, the adventurers and people of the city, and Hermes, the gods, all stared to the limit - he held the cracked slab with his hand and stood up with the dagger he was holding tightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes. Stand up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was only one man, and Orta's expression was unmoving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor was there a welcome. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just made 『affirmation』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The martial artist of the Inu, the warrior who merely affirms the battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do not defeat ...... you ...... can not go, Freya-sama there ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Asked with a brain that was not even conscious and in a dazed trance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So you can't see ...... Syr-sama ......? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I asked with a broken body covered with blood, equivalent to a corpse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can't you save ............ that person ............? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I won't allow it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then it was simple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was only one thing that Bell had to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That is .................. to defeat ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of this endless 'baptism', strangling himself who feels his own 'end', cutting off fear, crossing despair, and taking back the reason why he must fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Think about who you've been making cry since the day you were a complete idiot (Bell Cranel). </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Knock you ...... down ......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  eyes  that  took  back  the  light,  made  a  declaration  with  a  firm  and unwavering tone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm still thinking very freely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The light caused the vision to flicker, the thinking was interrupted several times, and the consciousness was intermittent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the only thing that is clear is the battle intent and awareness, which is in the soul (here). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The person I was once felt the "end", so I just had to become stronger than the person I was a second ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I want to cross the "strongest baptism" to meet "her". </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p197"></a>"That's right. Come here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Takeshi didn't smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strongest follower of the goddess just put up his sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go mad." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with the rabbit that showed its fangs, spat blood, and let out a roar, the fierce pig attacked from the front. </p>







<p class="calibre1">"Lord Bell ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crystal in Lily's hand reflected the young man's body as he was knocked away and his blood spilled all around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though he was overwhelmed by fear, Bell was still standing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  though  he  was  once  strangled  by  despair,  he  still  fought  against  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">'strongest'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, Lily must also go against this 'strongest military power', otherwise her words would all become lies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had to support him as a "supporter" of the boy, otherwise why would she be in such a place! </p>
<p class="calibre1">(So, one cannot give up! (Even if everyone else gives up, only Lily can't give up!) From her position overlooking the battlefield, she kept turning her maroon eyeballs moment by moment, updating the desperate battle situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(One person! One person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person, one person!!! It only takes one first rank adventurer to be knocked down and the course will change!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The result of this battle would definitely cut off the direction of the losing battle and breed a reversal of the『tide』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She knew very well that this 『one person』 was too far away. She didn't need to be told, she already understood that in this situation, it was just a dream, a mere daydream that would only invite ridicule on paper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(The "form" had already been drawn up! "Preparation" has been completed! The </p>
<p class="calibre1">"first level adventurer (enemy)" to be targeted has been decided! So there was still one more step to go, and I just had to find a way to take another step...!) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p198"></a>But Lily still kept groping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole brain overheated and her vision was tinged with a layer of crimson, but she still kept thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On top of the grave, just one person, this is the commander alone in the battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Welf and the others were defeated, and Bell was all over the place. Instincts and emotions had long since panicked and cried out, and the only reason still wore a mask of steel, holding itself steady. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily did not give up thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this situation, only she herself tried to stay calm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Think up, think up!!!) Lily was in this situation - she had to go and 『use』 Hedin-sama!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the teaching of the "brave men" of that Familia. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"If you want to be the commander in this battle, then from the beginning, you must be 'desperate'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was five days before the war games. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To Lilly, who had been receiving instruction without sleep, Finn said so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Desperate, right ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes. What are the tactics and cards you can prepare nowadays? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Welf-sama's 『Magic Sword』 mass production, Haruhime-sama's level up, Mikoto-sama's gravity magic, and Bell-sama's 【Hero Wish】...... can barely count on using Lily's transformation (magic) as a scout or to disrupt the situation, but I don't know I don't know how effective it will be ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah. That's not enough." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Finn say so in a voice without any malice - she had clearly believed his personality and told him about Haruhime's strongest hand - Lily couldn't help but stare at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... It still hurts Lily's heart when you say it so clearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's the truth. And now you have to face the 'reality' that is in front of you. It is not reasonable  or  contrary  to  common  sense  -  that  is,  the  "battle  power  gap"  that cannot be reversed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, Finn, who was sitting in a chair across the table, was not explaining the sure way to win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was more important than that, the 'preparation of the commander's mind'. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p199"></a>" Liliruca Artie. To be a commander, you must be more calm than anyone else, no matter what the situation is. Compared to a magician in the rearguard, you must be much calmer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... also need to become cruel?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sometimes. But that's not what you're after, is it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if her heart had been read inside, Lily nodded stiffly with that feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing that Lily wanted to stand next to Bell, Finn's lips took on the shape of a smile for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I will use everything. The inspiration, the state of affairs, even the sacrifice of my companions." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, you, who don't like sacrifice, will have to use everything more than I do. No more cards in hand? That's not true. You have to turn all the stones that fall nearby into your hand. Keep thinking and looking for opportunities to win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I (Finn) will not be standing on the battlefield that day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You (Lilly) will have to look for it with your own eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of despair, go look for the ray of light that is thinner than a pinhole. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otherwise the coalition of faction warlords cannot win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Your judgment and call must lead the way to victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn left her with a subject to complete, then asserted thus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">" Liliruca Artie, one more question for you. Who do you think your enemy is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The entire army of ...... called [Freya's Familia]." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There is nothing wrong with that. But, again, it's not the right answer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Guts, who had taught various strategies so far, stepped into more in-depth territory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The one you should look at carefully now is the one who is also the commander with you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A shock swept through Lily's wide-open eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That means..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, your enemy is Hedin Selander. The warlord of the Meishin faction, that cold-hearted one." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The direction Finn pointed out to her was to qualify the 『enemy』 that should be watched carefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the extreme, strong enemies such as other first level adventurers were left to their companions, and Lily should only put her attention on Hedin, he explained thus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If I were to compete with Hedin on strategy, I would lose four out of ten times." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p200"></a>"......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And I was able to beat him thanks to the cheat of 'Pain in the Finger'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn shrugged his shoulders and then stated the conclusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  conclusion  was  very  simple,  but  it  was  more  difficult  for  Lily  than  stepping through the depths of the dungeon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you want to lead the coalition army to victory as a commander, you must go and take advantage of Hedin." </p>
<p class="calibre1">「Lee, take advantage of ......! Not as a commander and beat him in the aspect of guessing the opponent!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's not possible." </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a gap in time as a military commander. There was a gap in my time as a military commander, in the ability to think on the spot, and in the structure of the mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The little human who started as a commander just a few months ago could never win against a elf sage who had spent a long time, Finn asserted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Use Hedin's tactics, strategy, and his thinking. Calculate his purpose, and then do not  set  a  trap,  but  turn  in  the  same  direction  as  him.  It's  like  too  much  power destroying your own body instead." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, Finn smiled at the dumbfounded Lily and said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There  will  be  no  perfect  battle.  There  will  be  no  surefire  strategy  or  invincible formation. Everything is imperfect. Catch that loophole - Hedin's cleverly hidden </p>
<p class="calibre1">'true meaning'. </p>

<p class="calibre1">(Lord Finn told Lilly the answer right from the start ......!) Halfway through the flashback, she finally understood what Finn had said along with the 『actual experience』 now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There won't be a perfect battle. That's exactly what happened. Even though the gods were being crushed one after another, and at first glance it looked like the end was near, Lily was still looking at "a path of blood". </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no surefire strategy, and there was no invincible formation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  is  only  the  "true  meaning"  of  the  commander's  picture  that  leads  to  the destination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, now we have to find that... </p>
<p class="calibre1">(--find it, find it, find it! The slightest change in the battlefield, the remaining battle force, anything! (Find all the clues within this second and launch the destination that Lord Hedin wants to reach!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p201"></a>Lily's physical time compressed to the limit, the smell of blood was felt deep in her nose, but she further accelerated her thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(The purpose of snatching Lord Hedin, and thinking! Then use it!!! If we can make the enemy's purpose out of control, and eventually both lose - !!!) Then, just as Lily's maroon pupils were staring at the battlefield, at the base camp where Hedin was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young girl was still for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(That's--) </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was an insignificant, really insignificant 『subtle change in the battlefield』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  the  "true  meaning  of  the  battlefield"  that  only  the  commander  (Lily)  who confronted him could perceive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why is the enemy's rear guard so close to Hedin-sama ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  cries  of  the  adventurers  who  continued  to  resist  were  mixed  with  the lamentations of the male gods and goddesses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the end of the gods. It is the tone that announces the imminent end of the war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shining sun had already passed overhead, but dusk would not fall for a long time. Hegyi, who was looking up at the clear sky, slowly turned his eyes back to the front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Allen and the others are about to decide on a winner ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black elfs, who were listening to the movement on the easternmost side of the island, were surrounded by adventurers who had been slashed numerous times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ouka, Chigusa, Bors, and the residents of the Labyrinth Inn Street (Riviera). </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was an execution site, all of them with slashing wounds and destroyed martial arts equipment. Of those who fell, most had their main gods out, and even if they could barely stand up, they were disqualified from fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni  glanced  at  Ouka  and  the  others'  eyelids  that  would  not  open  again,  and looked at the front with a gaze that shone with a deep purple glow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Despite this, you still refuse to break it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the 『execution ground』 where the silent adventurers were haphazardly overlapping together, there were still standing - only two people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Little, little Daphne ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaa ...... haaa ......!!! Cassandra, reply!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daphne, clad in a bloodied battle dress (dress), shouted at Cassandra, who had tears in her eyes behind her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even during this time of requesting the healer to reply, her eyes would never leave the  warlord  with  the  pitch-black  sword.  The  bruised  and  battered  fingers,  which </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p202"></a>could  break  at  any  moment,  gripped  the  short  sword  tightly  and  took  a  stance, showing the idea of complete resistance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tears in Cassandra's eyes, who had been protected by Ouka and the others, as well as by Daphne, finally fell, while she sang the reply spell with a trembling voice, "[Sol's Light]! . </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic light like sunlight immediately wrapped around Daphne, but could not plug all the wounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The side effect of the cursed weapon "Suffering Abyss" that Hogni was holding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pitch-black longsword, which was known as a killing attribute, was even able to stop the wounds from healing and delay the rhythm of recovery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ask again. Do you still want to struggle?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"First  level,  adventurer,  that's  a  strange  question  to  ask  ......!  I'm  not  down yet ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It has been twenty-two so far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the number of times Hogni cut Daphne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it has been sublimated, the fact that the second level adventurer Daphne has been subjected to the first level adventurer's one-hit kill chop and still hasn't fallen  has  gone  beyond  the  level  of  awe  and  turned  into  『unintelligible』.  The proof is that Ouka and the others' resistance all turned into nothing, sinking into the earth with just one or two blows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni  gave  mercy  and  did  not  want  to  kill  her,  probably  because  of  the  same reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the most crucial thing is - Daphne's staying power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Horne narrowed her eyes, which were activated with "magic", and stepped forward violently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo-woo!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The inescapable chopping light, Daphne couldn't block it with her sword, so she extended her left arm to defend (block). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, an incredible phenomenon happened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The left arm that should have been cut off bounced off The Passion of the Deep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead of a high-pitched metallic sound, a dull, heavy sound rang out, as if the sword blade had cut into a giant tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unable to counteract the impact, Daphne rolled ugly on the ground several times, panting heavily, and the left arm she had just used to defend herself hung down weakly, but she managed to stand up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, the surface where her left arm had been cut became like the crooked bark of a tree - 'bark'. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p203"></a>"Your ability ...... that has been resisting my slash since a while ago is『magic』? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......  is  a  "skill".  I've  been  thinking  that  it's  a  'curse'  because  it  was  chased  by Apollo-sama ............. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  young  lady  said  with  boredom,  she  tried  to  smile  bitterly  but  couldn't,  so  a smile that was not a smile emerged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daphne possesses the rare ability [Laurel Reincarnation]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The effect is that when the caster (Daphne) has little energy left and is near death, the ability value "durability" will increase significantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  range  of  the  ability  itself  can  be  chosen  at  will,  and  once  activated,  the epidermis will mutate. It turns into a "bark" with green light patterns like a leaf - just like the left arm that just changed drastically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  like  the  spirit  that  transformed  into  a  laurel  tree  to  protect  itself,  Daphne resisted Hogni's chopping blow with the power of this rare ability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Once activated, this ...... skin will be rough for a while ...... so I had not intended to use it ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To me, women's troubles are as mysterious and puzzling as that moon." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Underneath the strong-tongued Daphne's battle suit, her entire body had almost all mutated into "bark". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now she was afraid that it was very difficult to control the [Laurel Chakra], and her abused  body  was  making  an  unpleasant  creaking  sound,  and  the  'bark'  was eroding up to her neck and touching her left cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Little Daphne, stop it! If you use 『Skill』 again ......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cassandra's cries were ignored, and Hogni temporarily put down her sword and said to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you continue like this, you will really become a sphinx tree that cannot speak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why do you have to keep resisting my attacks even though you are living in this hell? </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Laurel Reincarnation] did not completely block Hogni's beheading. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bark of the left arm that received the blow was also partially cut off, and the blood, which was a mixture of crimson and amber, like tree sap, dripped down from it in a sticky manner. The foot that was cut diagonally, the shoulder that was cut horizontally, and the body that was swept away in a flash were all the same. Even after invoking the protection of the laurel tree, Daphne was not unharmed. It is not difficult to imagine that if the "skill" is released, then there will be a fierce pain to the girl in an instant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daphne, whose eyes were distorted in pain, slightly lifted the corners of her mouth, as if to say what a stupid question. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p204"></a>"It's  simple  ah  ......  stall  as  long  as  possible,  the  first  level  adventurers  ......  buy time ......! For Lili Luka and the girls ............ to win this war!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the reason why herself, as well as Ouka and the others didn't run away and chose to 『get cut down』, Daphne said so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing her last shout, Hogni closed her eyes, and opened them again with her sword eyebrows raised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is  that  so?  Then  let  it  be  over.  So  much  for  being  played  for  your  superficial purposes!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">An insult to a man who has given up his victory and is no longer a warrior. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And a touch of respect for those who risked their lives for their fellow soldiers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Horne  put  this  on  her  sword,  jumped  in  front  of  Daphne's  eyes,  and  swung  a powerful strike with determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Little Daphne--? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cassandra's wailing cry spilled out all around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daphne stared blankly as the laurel tree's shield was finally broken, and a large amount of blood foam flew out from her flesh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young girl staggered and fell backwards, and Cassandra rushed to hold the girl tightly in her arms. The blood that turned into sap dripped down Cassandra's arms, and the heat from the blood creeped her out and she sat down directly on top of the stone floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cassandra, Della ...... back, re ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't say a word, little Daphne! I will now--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--don't move." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cassandra was about to chant a spell, but the cold tip of her sword was pressed against her neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked up dumbfounded, only to see there stood a black elf with the look of a cold warlord on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you activate your magic, you will be considered as having the intention to resist and continue to carve the sword marks." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If  you  want  to  save  your  friend's  life,  drop  your  weapon  and  surrender  quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only in such cases will you be allowed to heal." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was an ultimatum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that thought, people like Cassandra would be cut down by him in an instant, and this was the last mercy of the lacquered elf knight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this time, hold your breath, the face of iron Cassandra's arm ...... was held by the fingers that were severely corroded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p205"></a>"Do not, tube ...... hurry, reply ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Little, little Daphne ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The not very conscious Daphne said to her as if she was between half asleep and half awake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Hogni would not wait, and even seemed unusually ruthless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Waiting for you for three seconds. Three, two, one -" </p>
<p class="calibre1">So Cassandra said, sorry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She apologized to Daphne and Bell and them, and threw down the long staff in her hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I surrender ......! Never again, will I fight ......! So, let me heal little Daphne ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hands  clutching  the  body  that  was  hurt  more  than  anyone  else,  pouring  tears overflowed and trickled down the tightly closed eyelids. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni silently withdrew his sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Idiot ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, I'm sorry, little Daphne ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daphne chided her friend for her foolish behavior and seemed to have exhausted all her strength and her whole body went limp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  tears  streaming  down  her  face,  Cassandra,  who  couldn't  stop  apologizing, used all of her mental energy to launch a recovery magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There are no more enemy soldiers here ...... is much slower than expected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeming  to  lose  interest  in  the  battlefield  where  only  he  survived,  Hogni  turned around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cassandra cast a reply magic on Daphne while looking at the black elf's back with eyes that were not yet dry from tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(In this way, the right flank of our allied forces is all destroyed ......! Now with the loss of the deputy commander (Little Daphne), it is impossible to subvert this battle situation with just Lilly-san alone!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The western part of the urban ruins, the right flank of the allied forces located on the north side of the 『main battlefield』 was completely silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within  sight,  only  Aisha's  left  flank,  which  had  successfully  merged  with  the remaining forces in the center, was still alive. But now that was also a candle in the wind. In a short time, the four Gulliver brothers will wipe them out and smash the girl's faint expectations to pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(The  enemy  base  camp,  and  the  Cinderellas  with  full  Bellies  were  unharmed! </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are still many tough warriors who did not attack towards the east side of the island and remained in the center! Even if Bell first lived down ...... can do nothing! </p>
<p class="calibre1">(There is nothing we can do!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p206"></a>In order to save the life of a friend (Daphne) and voluntarily give up the right to fight Cassandra cried out again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm  so  sorry  for  not  being  able  to  fight  to  the  end.  This  empty  apology  has  no meaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Will the last god's 'flower' fade first? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or will the last familia member fall to the ground first? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Either way, this war game will end with the victory of [Freya's Familia]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's all because I (Cassandra) am too useless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What "precognitive dream", what "prophet". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  like  last  night's  nightmare  (dream)  of  dusk  and  the  end,  the  tragic  seer (Cassandra) cannot change any fate... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--Eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just at that moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A gust of wind blew by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An uneventful wind blew the long hair of Cassandra, who was holding Daphne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wind was blowing towards the "Orza City Ruins" and the Puddle Lake from time to time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's a very mundane air movement that doesn't give any thought nowadays. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both the adventurers and the tough warriors don't care about it at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So that is only the prophet (Cassandra) knows, the prophecy of the turning point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The wind ............ wind ............ wind blew here?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She thought back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The 'revelation' that was uttered in front of Bell and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The 『hope』 that was seen in the midst of the miserable nightmare that broke through the final twilight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There was a wind that blew ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cassandra lifted her head as if she was being guided by something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blue sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dazzling sunlight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the dark shadow of a bird with wings spread in the distant sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, 『Wind』 slowly fell down... </p>

<p class="calibre1">"The wind blew..." </p>

<p class="calibre1">There was a thud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  sound  of  quiet  footsteps  rang  out,  and  Blast  (Wind)  descended  on  the battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p207"></a>"----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni turned back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black elf instantly perceived 『the greatest threat』 presenting its stance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The warlord's eyes widened and immediately drew the pitch-black sword that was stored in its sheath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who are you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni,  who  was  about  to  leave  the  battle  zone  with  the  right  flank  of  the  allied forces, waved his pitch-black coat and turned around violently, once again facing the battlefield head-on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The person standing in the front of the view was draped in a long dark green cloak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hood on the head, blocking the face, only vaguely visible elf ears of an elf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pupils that shone in the depths of darkness were the color of the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who are you guys!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">This gust of wind did not answer his question about his identity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come and join the battle. Are you ready, fellow countryman?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  simply  pulled  out  the  "Dark  Green  Wooden  Sword"  from  his  waist  and unleashed his battle intent at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ready? What are you talking about? </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, there was only one answer from Blastwind. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Preparation to be killed by my sword." </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Don't be arrogant! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The conflict broke out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both of them turned into the wind of divine speed, and in front of the sight of the stunned girl (Cassandra), the dark green wooden sword and the lacquered black longsword collided with each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">""?"" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In an instant, the sound of violent sword strikes resounded all around, and Lily, the survivors of the faction's allied forces, Hedin, the tough warriors, and Haider, the Cinderella with a full stomach, all cast shocked glances. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  followed  was  a  fiery  sword  fight.  The  long  dark  green  cloak  and  the  pitch black  coat  danced  like  a  whirlwind,  leaving  slashes  of  green  and  black  in  each other's trajectory. The clash and clash, the flash and the sound. The wooden sword with pale white magic power and the battle sword with black iron curse crossed each other several times, creating beautiful and unsettling sparks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Heyaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p208"></a>"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A flash of Hogni swept across the elf's field of vision and removed her hood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if it was full out, what flowed down from it - was beautiful long golden hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf who tied the 『true hair』 that reached the bottom of her neck into a bundle </p>
<p class="calibre1">- Ryu shouted out with a voice like a crack as a counterattack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo...?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dark green wooden sword bounced back the lacquered black spell sword and sliced through part of the coat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The attack and defense of one in and one out did not stop. The duel between the elfs  suddenly  erupted,  leaving  both  the  adventurers  and  the  tough  warriors speechless - but causing loud cries to come from the 'city side'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who is that?" -------- Who is that? </p>
<p class="calibre1">A tsunami of noise swept through Orario, sparked by Ibri's loud voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  people  who  had  not  said  anything,  the  mob  all  poked  their  bodies  out  and stared at the beautiful elf's figure reflected in the 'mirror'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, hey, hey, what's wrong? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Helpers of the coalition army? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The masked adventurer ...... is who the hell is Leon! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't mention that again! "She has no intention of hiding, does she? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, didn't you say that [Blizzard] died long ago? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is the official big lie maker Guild doing? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She's fighting against our [Black Demon Sword]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gods were screaming - no, there was a sound of sadness and joy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  thirtieth  floor  of  the  Tower  of  Babel.  Whether  it  was  the  goddesses  who supported the alliance of factions or the male gods who were Freya's empaths, all of them stood up, and one after another, some gods covered their heads with their hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no mask on the side face of the elf that was flying rapidly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That  elf  wrapped  around  the  『speedy  wind』,  revealed  its  true  identity,  and stepped onto that battlefield as a elf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The silence that was like a funeral just a moment ago was now transformed into a chaotic  cry  of  grief  that  erupted  here,  mixed  with  shock  and  the  characteristic pleasure (laughter) of a god who sensed the rising storm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(-Followed my sword technique!?) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p209"></a>Meanwhile,  the  one  who  appeared  more  stunned  than  anyone  else  on  the battlefield  was  none  other  than  Hogni  himself  who  was  still  sword-fighting  right now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Empty-colored pupils. The sharp sword path. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He still remembered it. It was impossible to forget. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  one  whom  the  Goddess  of  Beauty  (Freya)  had  a  crush  on  -  the  Elf  of  the Bountiful Tavern [Blast]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, the two engaged in a battle at the Goddess Festival, and he himself rendered his opponent helpless and won an overwhelming victory, but now it was different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's right, she followed up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The opponent resisted Hegeni's speed, Hegeni's power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She also didn't have that incredible golden light on her body that makes the ability mimic sublimation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the true [ability value] of the elf in front of her. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p class="calibre1">Hogni's face, whose eyes twitched in shock, distorted and flashed in his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After flicking Ryu away, he roared out in anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You bastard - Lv. 6!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dumbfounded tough warriors doubted their ears as a question rang out across the battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did you [upgrade] twice from Lv.4? </p>

<p class="calibre1">"It's possible! Very! It's possible!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was still the 30th floor of the Tower of God (Tower of Babel). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermes  let  out  a  shout  of  joy,  no  less  loud  than  the  gods  around  him  who  had caused the frenzy (atmosphere) to explode. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Little  Ryu  had  been  fighting!  From  the  day  the  dark  period  ended!  Even  after leaving the Lord God (Astraea)! This is the course of struggle that is not inferior to Little Ace and their first rank adventurers, a succession of 'great deeds'!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">--The  main  force  of  the  Dark  Faction  was  successfully  destroyed  by  just  one person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--He broke through the 18th floor of "Lacquer Goliath". </p>
<p class="calibre1">--The war game with [Apollo's Familia]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--The numerous battles around the Heretic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--The duel to the death with Bell after falling to the "deep layer". </p>
<p class="calibre1">--and crossed the biggest karma, the Destroyer (Juggernaut). </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are so many deadly fights that Ryuo has overcome, just Hermes knows. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p210"></a>These are the level one 'greatness' of the order that the male gods would agree with,  the  avalanche  of  that  avalanche  of  'trials'  assemblage  that  the  goddesses would feel grief and heartache. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In itself, five years ago, when it disappeared, [Blast] was located in the uppermost position of Lv. 4. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, there were already rumors that she was about to [upgrade]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If we refer to the time that [Sword Girl] went through to reach Lv. 6 from Lv. 4, then for Ryu, the number of 'five years' was by no means an impossible number of years to achieve this 'greatness'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since the Age of God, it was the first time in history that there was a "continuous ascension". </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a great achievement that even the world's fastest rabbit has not achieved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The [Loki Familia] who were watching the battle at the base, and even Ace opened their eyes greatly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Until today, she had been at a loss, but still dedicated herself to the 'justice' she had  believed  in,  saving  Bell-kun  and  many  other  children!  Then,  a  continuous ascension is naturally not impossible!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She hadn't had to fight in the 'bondage' of Lv. 4 so far, so the situation was only worse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  she  had  become  a  first  level  adventurer,  then  these  'trials'  would  have  been moderate, but for Lv. 4, it became the 'greatest cruelty' to Ryu's body. The quantity and quality of 『Greatness』 - even the [experience value] that had been gaining advanced - was naturally able to breed the 『unknown』 that overturned the entire lower world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All because the elf had obtained the answer and learned of its own justice, that is, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'hope'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Catch up ah, little Ryu ...... Astraea! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  the  war  game,  it  was  Hermes  who  assisted  Ryu  to  go  to  the  main  god (Astraea),  and  now  seeing  the  long-awaited  『reinforcements』,  he  showed  a heartfelt smile. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"I  was  helpless  against  you  and  against  the  [Fierce  One],  and  was  miserably defeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  long  dark  green  jacket  that  the  teenagers  (Bell)  were  very  familiar  with, underneath were shorts and boots in the color of a large tree. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu, who wore a pure white battle suit on the upper half of his body, said this while cutting into his opponent. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p211"></a>"Then, I can no longer stand still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's why she left Orario alone and embarked on a journey to the side of the main god (Astraea). </p>
<p class="calibre1">To renew the stagnant [Ability Value]. To become stronger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  assistance  and  information  from  Hermes  and  Asfi,  she  arrived  at  the Sword Smithing City 『Solingen』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the place where Lady Justice had settled five years ago, and where she believed that she would one day become Ryu's power and settle here, the world's best "sword-making city". </p>
<p class="calibre1">So,  the  new  weapon  that  Ryu  is  holding  in  her  hand  today  is  both  a  product  of chance and necessity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wooden sword "Elvis Lumina" that was destroyed during the battle with The Destroyer (Juggernaut), and the sword of stardust "Elvis Justitia" that was reborn using it as a material. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  new  sword  of  the  elf  was  given  the  alias  of  Astraea,  the  "Star  Maiden  of Justice". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I will win you this time - [Black Elf Sword]." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The quiet determination called forth the true blast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing  Hogni,  who  was  still  stunned  and  confronted  her,  Ryu  went  on  the offensive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She tossed her long golden hair that was tied into a bundle and let loose a flurry of strikes. The wooden sword, which had a range that rivaled Hogni's longsword, was equipped with the user's "magic power", and with Ryu's own "Spiritual Charge (Skill)", it was not at all like the power of a defender specialization race (elf). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  terms  of  pure  "power",  Hogni's  slash  should  have  had  the  advantage,  but  it bounced away, giving the brown hand a splintering impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Surround the elf, Tough Warrior!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just then, an instruction came from among the healers who were on standby in the rear guard position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was none other than Hayid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  quickly  regarded  Ryu,  who  was  now  evenly  matched  with  Hogni,  as  an unstable factor and gave orders to the Tough Warrior on her own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haider, you bastard!!! Are you trying to interfere with our duel! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Unfortunately, I don't care about your reserve, Hegyi-sama! The highest priority is the glory of Freya-sama and victory! Am I wrong?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p212"></a>"In  order  to  offer  the  sacrifice  (Bell)  to  that  Lord,  we  have  to  eliminate  even  the slightest element of unease, that is our mission! </p>
<p class="calibre1">After pulling away from Ryu, Hogni immediately shouted excitedly, but the other party brought up the main god he revered, so he could only grit his teeth and creak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While acting as a healer, Haider was also very capable. She took the place of the commander's tower (Hedin) located in the main camp to accurately command and completely prevent the enemy from raising the wolf's smoke of counterattack. The right flank of the allied forces as well as the central forces were all destroyed long ago, then the battle force was concentrated on the side of Ryu who was Lv. 6. The tough warriors located in the center of the 『main battlefield』 quickly responded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pressure on the left flank (Aisha) and others who were forced into a desperate situation  was  relieved,  but  in  an  instant,  at  least  forty  second  level  adventurers surrounded Ryu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu slowly looked around the prison formed by the warriors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arrows, long staffs, and erected swords and guns all aimed at her standing in the center of the encircling net. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Not even one-on-one is allowed in the knight's graveyard. Curse it, curse the here and now, and the destiny of us all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the signal was given, numerous weapons ripped off the wings (feathers) of the elfs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Comprehending  the  end  that  was  going  to  occur  in  a  minute,  a  look  of  regret seeped from Hogni's face as he unraveled his stance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How can ......! Ryu-sama!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even the fire that raises the smoke of the wolves, the faction of the allied forces (you) will not be able to get it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the difference between the remaining forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On one side was Lily, who had no son available and could only look on from the sidelines, while on the other side was Haider, whose strongest military force was still alive, who stared at the 『Elf Execution Ground』 with an icy gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The remnants of the clothes that were set on fire by Molde were twisted into a rope by  her  and  put  around  the  exposed  chest  position,  and  the  healer's  maiden extended one hand and gave the call. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"End her, tough warrior..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be precise, she was about to give the order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, before she gave the instruction, Ryu whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm going to use it, Astraea-sama." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p213"></a>Yes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like pieces of stars falling from the sky, a voice reached the elf's slender ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the "Smile of the Goddess". </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the "blessing of the stars". </p>
<p class="calibre1">She held the sword of stardust "Elvis Justia" with both hands, the tip of the sword pointing to the sky, and stood in front of it like a knight - and like a star maiden of war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then she closes her eyes and recites the brand new magic name (power). </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Astraea - Memoir]" </p>

<p class="calibre1">Instantly, 『The radiance of the stars』 appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Magic formation! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  unfolded  under  the  elf's  feet  was  not  the  proud  muzzle  of  a  magician's cannon, but a large number of 『Swarm of Light Words』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like  the  grace  engraved  on  her  back,  it  was  the  sacred  writing  itself  that symbolized 『Sword and Wing of the Stars』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[The mission is achieved, the balance will be right]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">What the elf's lips began to weave was a righteous psalm that had the appearance of a holy word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chanting ......!? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's magic! Don't let her activate it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the incantation that resounded all around, the eyes of the tough warriors widened and they immediately started to act. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The arrows that were set up and the fire cannons of 『Magic Sword』 came from all directions, yet - they were stopped again by the 『Glory of the Stars』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What--? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shock swept over the Tough Warriors, as well as Hogni and Haider. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The field of light that unfolded in a 5M radius with Ryu as the center blocked the sword rain and the demon blasts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  light  crystallized  in  the  air  and  countless  sacred  words  covered  Ryu  like stardust, turning it into a barrier to protect her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A boundary! No... "Star's Righteous Domain (Sacred Domain)"? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the only way to describe it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  time  that  Hogni's  eyes  were  wide  open,  the  elf's  chanting  was accelerating as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p214"></a>"[Order as a fortress, cleanliness as a crown, and breaking evil as a lamp]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  positive  domain  that  bounced  off  all  kinds  of  attacks  and  the  song  of  star chanting  that  resounded  all  around  caused  the  strong  warriors  whose  anxiety burned their bodies to kick the ground unbearably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They slashed up directly, attacking the group of words of light with their swords, guns, axes, or downward slashes or jabs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there was still no point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the eyes of the stunned them and them, neither slashing nor thrusting could penetrate the barrier, but instead, they themselves were pushed back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[In the name of the Goddess, we will drive alongside the sky and fill the earth with star trails]-" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, Hogni turned into a pitch-black arrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He threw away the resignation and sorrow he had just felt and swung down his pitch-black sword to break the Stargazer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  fierce  flash  of  light  lifted  up,  and  for  the  first  time,  the  Masamune  domain produced a shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The light flickered and pushed Hogni as hard as he could, and he glared his eyes to the limit and let out a roar. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Instantly,  with  a  high-pitched  shattering  sound  like  glass  shattering,  he  broke through the barrier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni crossed over the Star Guardian who lost to the Lv. 6 full power slash and stepped into it, the sword in his hand slashed across to Ryu who was standing in the center. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"-[Justice is flowing]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu was a little faster than him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chanting was completed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both eyes snapped open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the empty-colored pupils appeared, the jaw-dropping Hegyi saw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fragment of the star that should have been broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The glittering crystals of sacred words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They all rushed towards Ryu and were absorbed by her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The 'Star Contract' that binds each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu hid the 'answer to justice' she had arrived at in her heart and called out her name. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p215"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Saffron Prosperity Wisp! </p>

<p class="calibre1">Red Flame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword of stardust wrapped around the glow of the red lotus and blew away Hogni. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword strike he released was also bounced backwards together, and his feet and left hand cut the ground fiercely before finally coming to a halt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tough warriors, adventurers, and gods all became speechless when they saw the crimson glow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Flame Empowerment Magic ......! How is it possible!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Hogni shouted out, people were also talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only those who knew "that magic" were shocked and left those who didn't know aside, creating a whirlwind of confusion (a clamor). </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ Alizée?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beyond the island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quite far from the battlefield, the first level adventurer (Shakti) who saw this sight murmured in a daze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before her pupils became moist and produced teardrops, Hogni's roar preempted her and boomed all around. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Red Masahana! Alize-RoBell's magic!!!" </p>

<p class="calibre1">That was the name of the apostle of justice that dissipated five years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This『magic』was mastered by the girl who fought against『evil』and left flaming petals in the memories of many people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni also knew it. He remembered it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The glory of the maidens (Astraea's familia) who went forward in that dark period. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was also the figure  of  the [Red Masahana], which was  burning brilliantly, and was particularly fiery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  flame  of  the  maiden  emitted  a  dazzling  light  that  she  could  never  have,  so Hogni Ragnar secretly respected the maiden and would never forget her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why are you able to use that 『magic』! [Blizzard]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sensing Hogni's agitation, Ryu, with a noble flame, simply replied back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I ended the journey." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a long journey. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p216"></a>The end of the journey that the elfs who lived in stagnation came to when all the other companions fell and they themselves ignited the flame of revenge and turned into ashes for a time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crossing the thousands of layers of darkness brought by the deep (dungeon), the white Bell of a young man guided him to the other side of the light, and finally found the "answer to justice" and "hope" of Ryu-Lion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then I met Astraea again and inherited the will of Alizé and the girls. That's all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">After meeting her sovereign, the goddess, again, she was able to bear the fruit and manifest it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a new "magic" that was engraved on Ryu's back (ability value). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  flames  attached  to  her  hands,  feet,  and  sword  burned  as  if  echoing  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"justice" of the elfs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll say it again. Let's put everything we have into it - we'll beat you this time!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She kicked at the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The flaming soles of her boots exploded through the stone floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  next  instant,  the  flower  of  shattering  bloomed,  and  Ryu  turned  into  a  red lotus projectile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She shrugged off the perceptive speed of a second level adventurer and came in front of the stunned Tough Warrior and swung the chopping blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Red flames burst out. Then, the blow killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Star Sword was equipped with a powerful flame enchantment, and with just one swing, the Lv. 4 human was rendered unable to fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tamuz! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How is it possible...? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"One strike! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Red Track didn't stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The flames attached to the feet were like a propellant and a 'fuel'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu  projected  the  fierce  burst  of  flame  that  [Red  Masahana]  was  good  at  onto himself and slashed at the hastily disoriented [Freya's Familia]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One flash, two flashes, then skipped three and came directly to five flashes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fast, wind-like sword path was accompanied by explosive shattering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under the exaggerated must-kill that seemed contradictory at first glance, the five strong warriors sank into the ground together. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p217"></a>She used the "fire power" that she called the original intent of her fire magic, which is known for its sheer power, and burned the enemy and his body armor equally, whether it was a sword or a shield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Damn it, damn it, damn it, damn it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tough warriors roared as they lost six of their companions in an instant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They expected Ryu to break the corner of the encircling net and break away, but she  took  advantage  of  the  situation  to  advance  towards  their  side,  which  made them extremely angry again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So they swung their great swords, aimed their bows, and were about to thrust their lances - all to no avail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No attack or defense could match the flight of an elf clad in red lotus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoo-hoo!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wind speed and the roar of the flame created a chain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tough warriors were all scattered by Ryu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was nothing they could do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  were  defeated  by  her  one  after  another,  and  even  the  gods  and  people watching the battle were shocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If I had to list their "mistakes", it would be the inability to work together quickly that caused this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Hedin was directing from the sidelines, or if it was the [Loki Familia] that valued the power of "organization", then they would have been able to respond no matter how badly damaged they were. But they were "Tough Warriors". The blazing intra-factional struggle made them too exhausted with their "individual" power, so they could swarm with their companions but could not take complex tactics to hinder the elfs' movements. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And for Ryu now, she would never lose as long as the "one-on-one" process was repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni was quite sure of that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, Hogni had seen 『that』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind Ryu who swung at high speed, 『the face of the red-haired girl』 could be seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  vision  was  seen  overlapping  with  her  body,  the  vision  of  [Red  no  Masahana] </p>
<p class="calibre1">surfacing a smile and fighting with [Blast]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf was not alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The [Red Flame] and the [Blast] danced together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if they had never been separated, the maidens went forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p218"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is that ...... Little Alizée's magic!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tower of God was once again wrapped in shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  is  no  god  here  who  does  not  know  about  the  [Astraea  familia]  that  was destroyed five years ago (new powder). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing Ryu use powerful flame-giving magic, the gods even forgot to sit down and shouted out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She's using someone else's magic! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does it mean ......『Summoning』! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Same as [Thousand No Elfs]? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this lower world, the "summoning magic (cheating method)" that can use other people's magic was only confirmed in one familia member, and the gods were still in high spirits while making speculations, chattering and making a lot of noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's not 『summoning』." </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, just one column of gods, Hermes denied the guess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That is -『Inheritance』." </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a smile on his face, he asserted as if he had seen something dazzling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The 'justice' of the maidens flowed back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like  the  countless  lights  inhabiting  the  night  sky,  the  will  of  [Astraea's  Familia] </p>
<p class="calibre1">scattered and became the light of stardust, but it lived on in Ryu's heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Memories of the Stars (Astraea - Memoirs)]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "magic" that Ryu manifested together with the sublimation of Lv. 6. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its ability is, as the gods (Hermes) say, 'Inheritance of Justice'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The divine blood of the Goddess of Justice (Astraea), who is engraved on her back, is inhabited by ten of her familia members who have the same "divine grace" as her,  and  she  is  able  to  inherit  their  "magic"  and  use  it,  a  "miracle  (magic)"  that belongs only to Ryu-Lion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  a  rather  unusual  and  abnormal  state  of  affairs,  a  possibility  of  the  lower world, a particularly special "unknown". </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was also a vow that the Sword of Justice and the Feather had fulfilled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermes felt the most intense excitement of the day, while smiling and clapping up his hands and giving his blessing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... [Families of Astraea]." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's [Families of Astraea] ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under the high tower, the central square. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  the  flame  of  justice  reflected  in  the  『God's  Mirror』  above  his  head,  a certain man who was doing business shed tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p219"></a>In the dark period, the couple who was saved by the righteous familia members held their daughter and sobbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the 'fruit of justice'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The high purity of the maidens who hold high the banner of justice and what they have done will not disappear, and this is the best evidence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People do not know why she is standing on that battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there was only one thing he and she would do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tears of the people eventually turned into angry waves of solidarity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"[--The sky of the ethereal forest at this moment, dotted with the stars of the pale night sky]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Please respond to the foolishness of me, and grant the protection of star and fire only at this moment. Shelter with the mercy of light those who have abandoned you]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though she inherited the "justice" of the maidens (Alizée), Ryu's own "magic" </p>
<p class="calibre1">has not declined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Parallel Chanting" ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stop her, stop her, stop her! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  singing  and  the  magic  power  that  resounded  all  around  caused  the  tough warriors to lose their cool and rush at Ryu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  they  couldn't  catch  her.  Not  only  that,  those  who  tried  to  interrupt  the chanting and recklessly approached were decapitated with explosions one by one, and were crushed in turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Geez! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni, who had been frozen in place, also turned pale and slashed at Ryu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing a first level adventurer who was very different from the other fighters, even Ryu could not easily dodge it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Come on, displaced wind, wanderer. Cut through the sky, through the wilderness, beyond all things]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  she  was  able  to  slash  down  the  slash  again  and  again,  solidly  pushing  the chanting forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">High-speed  chanting  under  high-speed  combat.  Ryu  showed  the  technique  that disgraced『Magic Swordsman』and, most crucially, the guts to defy the enemy's attack, causing Hogni to crook his face bitterly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It made him think: this compatriot was more used to singing than anyone else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(And, there is even a magic formation ......!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p220"></a>Unfolding under her feet was a dark green glow that looked as if it symbolized the pattern of the forest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its ability to significantly increase the power of  『magic』 is a proof of an upper level magic guide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until five years ago, when her whereabouts were unknown, [Blast] did not have the nature of a magician. Horne realized that she had even revealed a brand new magic  guide  (ability),  and  realized  that  the  upcoming  『Cannon  attack』  was unusual and would throw the battle into chaos. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Horne, even at Lv. 6, he was able to cut down his opponent who was distracted from chanting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But "Flame Petal" stopped him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had he been one step away from breaking Ryu's stance, the flames attached to Ryu's sword would have exploded, disrupting Hogni's stance and spacing instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unstoppable, the impact hit him hard and was a thought shared by those watching from the outside. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Too fast--?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf's posture that he couldn't catch up with his own eyes stunned Haider. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(So strong...) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the loud opera, Hedin recognized his compatriots who might be able to match them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(What is this ah ah ah-!?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the unnatural sight of her being far superior to the tough warrior, Lily fell into confusion, and her eyes couldn't stop rolling around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Boarding Stardust Light to destroy the enemy]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Lv. 6 elf's proud『Cannon Strike』was released from its restraints. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「[Starlight Wind]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The large light jade cannon swarm that wrapped around the green wind engulfed the『main battlefield』. </p>

<p class="calibre1">A wide area attack magic that is released overhead by jumping high up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each shot of stardust glow carried a fierce destructive power, and all the strong warriors within the area of effect were blown away and smashed to the ground, swallowed by light and wind, and defeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only the front guard, the shelling also included Haider, the rear guard, in the range  of  attack,  even  the  full-Bellied  cinderellas  were  pushed  into  the  vortex  of impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p221"></a>「「「「 what!? 」」」」 </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That magic ...... Does it mean anything!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ryu-sama?!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Gulliver brothers were astonished to see the right flank of the allied forces, which should have been destroyed, set off a turbulent flow of light and wind, and Aisha and Mikoto's eyes widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ Ryu." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deep in the distance of the field of vision, from the moment of seeing this chain of flashes from the 『House of God』, Freya, who had no way of knowing the details of the battlefield, also knew about the [Blast] appearing. The two guards of men and women who were scrambling finally returned, while she put on a personality mask to avoid being seen in anyone's mind, and then narrowed her silver pupils. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shock also reached Bell, who had been beaten up by Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The boom also reached the ears of Allen, who was hunting the gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shock startled even Hestia, who was desperately trying to escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The intervention of just one elf had thrown 『Orza City Ruins』 into chaos. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How dare you! ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only one who was able to escape from this violent storm of light was Hogni. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black elf even used his own ultra-short text chanting『Magic』to counteract the great light jade, while avoiding the crisis with movements that far exceeded the surrounding crowd, and at that moment he was quickly looking around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The damage on his side was severe. The tough warriors concentrated in the north of the 『main battlefield』 were almost completely destroyed, and the cinderellas with full stomachs like Haider, who had fallen due to the shelling that caused some of the healers to fall, wanted to make an immediate reply, but could not accurately grasp  the  situation  on  the  battle  line.  This  is  all  thanks  to  the  stardust  magic (starlight  wind)  rolled  up  a  lot  of  sand  and  dust.  The  aftermath  of  the  shelling caused the ears to remain deaf, and even the position of Hedin, who was located at the very back, disappeared from view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to the tattered coat without a single injury, Hedin showed its prowess as  a  first-class  adventurer,  but  at  this  time  he  was  frowning  and  accurately understood the enemy's (Ryu) 『true intention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(This is not a concentrated fire aimed at me alone, but an annihilation shot that extends the range to the limit! It scattered the others and removed the redundant </p>
<p class="calibre1">『obstacle』! That means...!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, there are only two people standing on the battlefield of the North. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p222"></a>At this point, the conditions for a "single combat" have been met. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's fight it out." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu broke through the rising sand and led the red flames and approached from overhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With his head tilted up and his eyes wide open, Hogni took on the sword of stars with a look worthy of a warlord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't underestimate me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black spell sword and the red flame star sword met again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  surroundings  were  still  locked  by  the  gray  and  yellow  curtain,  forming  a battlefield of sand and dust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one can intervene, no one can interfere. The knight's graveyard where even single combat was not allowed has long since disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  the  elfs  of  white  and  black  really  put  their  full  strength  to  defeat  the enemy in front of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Too slow! Naive! --It's too light! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing this arrogant compatriot who only wanted to defeat himself, Hogni struck hard with his reserve of the sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After parrying Ryu's flaming chopping blow and parrying back, he used his sword to destroy his opponent's temporarily erected hand armor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The body was bathed in countless fire powder, but Hogni was the only one not to take the direct blow of the bursting chop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The incredibly powerful empowering magic is indeed a threat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  the  range  of  effect  and  power  of  the  flames  had  been  thoroughly mastered during the engagement of『Parallel Chanting』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He accurately saw through the 'holes' in Ryu's current fighting style. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even if you wrap yourself around the Flame of Friendship, you will not be able to burn this warrior killer of mine! </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you don't think about it properly and try to make the powerful fire explode at a very  close  distance,  it  often  carries  the  risk  of  forcing  the  wielder  into  a  self-destructive situation. Ryu is not like [Red Masahana] that can adjust the strength and effect of the fire at will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the direction that Hogni should go, is ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hold the awareness of being burnt by the flame and step forward, there is the living path that the strong warriors failed to cross. There is indeed a "loophole" where </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p223"></a>only Hogni, who is one of the best in the [Freya Familia] in white combat, can jump into it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cleave it, my beloved sword (Abyss of Crucifixion)! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo! </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, the power of Hogni's spell sword "Abyss of Crucifixion" was still alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Farther  ahead  than  the  long  blade,  the  expanded  chopping  range  crossed  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Flame Petal』 and shallowly cleaved the shoulder of Ryu who had stepped back in the nick of time. The unseen blade was like a sword of vacuum that could not be stopped even by the flames of the explosion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  killing  attribute  known  as  'avant-garde  killer'  is  not  to  be  underestimated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Combined  with  Hogni's  excellent  sword  skill,  it  turned  into  an  unseen  dance  of chopping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't be too proud of yourself if you only sublimated twice! Little girl, you are still Bellow me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only did the enemy achieve an unheard of greatness (upgrade), but he also grasped  his  『vessel』  accurately.  It  was  not  at  the  mercy  of  the  drastically increased  ability.  I  don't  know  what  she  did  before  coming  here,  but  it's  really commendable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite that, this level still couldn't subvert Hogni's combat technique and combat experience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first level adventurers of other faction valves were different from the first level adventurers of [Freya's Familia]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  "skill  and  strategy"  that  were  honed  to  the  extreme,  the  awareness  of  not fearing death, and the loyalty to the Goddess turned them into warriors worthy of the name of the hero. This is what happens when you cross the "Baptism", win the struggle within the dispensation, and climb to the top of the tough warriors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  if  the  righteous  apostles  (Alizé)  supported  Ryu,  there  was  no  reason  that Hogni, who had summoned his strongest self by virtue of self-transformation magic (Dainesleif), would lose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--This should have been the case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He boldly stepped forward and continued his attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forcing wounds on his enemy's cheeks and arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Hogni he -- was being pushed back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hoo!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryuna painfully beat the decapitation of the lacquered sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Vividly blazing flaming petals. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p224"></a>Gradually, indeed, it became a threat to Hogni. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(What ......!?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  enemy's  movement  became  faster  -  no.  It  was  Hogni's  reaction  speed  that was decreasing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The flesh gradually couldn't keep up with the movements depicted in his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"-This is 『War Game』." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The empty-colored pupils declared so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing that Hegyi was shaken by the change in his body, Ryu also stepped forward and said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fellow  countryman.  How  many  adventurers  did  that  sword  cut  down  before fighting me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment he heard those words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment I heard these words, an overwhelming shock spread through Hegyi's entire body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Does that mean--?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The five fingers holding the 『Cursed Sword』 trembled like a twitch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sand and dust gradually cleared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gray-yellow curtain gradually cleared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni looked around while resisting Ryu's onslaught. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tough warriors who had fallen. Nope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The healers (Haider) who were preparing to reply to their companions. No. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wounded curator (Daphne) who was still sleeping while being held tightly by the maiden (Cassandra). --It's this guy! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's this guy's 『combat』 that made me (Hogni) ---! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A 'cursed weapon' grants a powerful boon, but relatively, it also produces a 'price'! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The main example is that it leads to a reduction in ability, or - physical exertion! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Ryu said, Hogni's weapon, the "Afflicted Abyss", was a "cursed weapon". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The weapon exerted the killing property of extending the range of the beheading, at the cost of gradually taking away the user's strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the same as the wounds caused by a curse, which cannot be immediately and completely repaired by medicine or magic, and is a "curse" itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni had inadvertently overused this 『cursed weapon』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing  the  unprecedented  "army  of  superior  adventurers"  of  the  faction's  allied forces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing Daphne and the girls, the "rabble" that challenged him without a plan! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The people who fought you before me have weakened your power! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p225"></a>Hearing Ryu's declaration along with the slam, Hogni's pupils trembled with fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--Let him slash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ouka, Chigusa, Bors, and the residents of the Labyrinth Inn Street who  obeyed this order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Daphne herself who gave this order, all forcibly ripped out his chopping from Hogni as much as possible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  adventurers  pretended  that  they  were  『prey  waiting  to  be  hunted』  and consumed Hogni's 『decapitation count』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Little Daphne ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cassandra, who was still sitting on the ground, looking at the fierce battle between Ryu and the girls, shed tears and clung to Daphne's body full of wounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's why she gave the 『worst order』 like a tyrant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not in order to delay the battle called the first level adventurer and buy time, but in order to try to weaken Hogni's power and entrust it to her companions, Daphne and the girls only voluntarily fell into hell and kept enduring the cleavage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(How is it possible--!?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The normal Hogni wouldn't do something as stupid as misusing a 'cursed weapon'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But since the fierce battle with Tsubaki, he was the one who fought hardest against the main battle force of the faction's alliance, so he unknowingly became impatient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pure threat of 『Crozzo's Magic Sword』, pushing the Lv. 5 forger to Lv. 6, the  foul  『Level  Ascension  (Radiance)』,  and  the  dying  and  overly  stubborn Daphne and their right wing team. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wherever there was a mistake, they would be 'wounded', and it was because they felt this potential of the faction's allied forces firsthand that Hogni didn't even realize he was becoming too aggressive and rushing to annihilate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was connected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything dovetailed together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  understanding  the  strategy  of  the  Commander-in-Chief  (Lily),  the  Vice Commander (Daphne) played a ploy, and the "will to win" of the dependents who had been struggling miserably until the end of the Tsubaki's battle - all connected in this moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If this was purely a one-on-one battle, the winner might not be known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A high-speed slashing flash came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The longsword was finally snapped out of his grip, and Hogni's time stood still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But, now it's our victory! </p>
<p class="calibre1">With this shout - a thud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tip of the sword was pressed against Hegyi's chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p226"></a>The red flame attached to the right hand, and the star sword swelled to the limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a huge amount of magic power, Ryu shouted out the name 『Must Kill』. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Inferno!!!" </p>

<p class="calibre1">It exploded. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The red lotus burst released at zero distance exploded Hogni's body into the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The body was burned, shattered, flying, bound by gravity, and smashed backwards into the rubble of the remains of the structure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smoke rises from the limbs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The battle suit burns and falls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bangs covered his eyes where his consciousness was severed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The battlefield carved a blank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The knockdown of the first level adventurer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fall of Lv. 6. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  was  something  that  would  never  have  happened,  the  strongest  stronghold producing a 『crack』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone froze in place, unable to make a sound, and stopped moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next instant. </p>




<p class="calibre1">『Breakdown --------- -!!! 【Black Demon Sword】Breakdown --------- -!!!』 </p>




<p class="calibre1">The  Labyrinth  City  (Orario)  on  the  other  side  of  the  mountains  turned  into  a scorching pot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Break! Break! Ha, wait, eh eh eh eh eh eh eh! Lv. 6 was broken! What is this at all? It's so fierce ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iltae screamed and fell into chaos, shouting recklessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p227"></a>He poked his body out of his seat and spread his voice around, not caring whether his  throat  would  be  dumb  or  not,  and  then  the  people  followed  suit  one  after another. So did the adventurers. The gods even roared to their hearts' content. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--------- ---------- -----!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole city was shaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sky was shocked and the earth shook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  roaring  shout  ignited  the  fire  in  everyone's  heart,  and  even  made  the neighboring countries think that the 'center of the world' had exploded, and they were extremely excited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We've got it! It's taken! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiona's eyes were still glued to the "mirror" and her hands grabbed the shoulders of the girl (Ace). Clap! She shook it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She couldn't stop shaking Ace's body, ignoring the fact that her long golden hair was dancing wildly and she was in a frenzy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The [Black Demon Sword] has broken through! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next to her, her sister Tionne, who was standing up like flying, turned into a slave of excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The cadre of [Freya's Familia] ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the first level adventurer successfully knocked down, Riveria and Gareth's eyes widened tremendously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"-That's right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Finn he. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing this small but still maintained chance of victory, he sent a smile to the young girl who gave this 『indication』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"『『『『 Well ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The god tower standing in the middle of the city has lost its language ability. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both  gods  and  goddesses,  whether  they  supported  the  god  of  beauty  or  the opposite side, all stood up and jumped up in excitement, hugging the gods beside them with all their strength and staring at the "mirror" wrapped in vibration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The city shook violently. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p228"></a>A "meteor of justice" descended from the plate that everyone thought was certain to be defeated, turning the entire land of Orario into a huge vortex of red lotus that would never be extinguished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's great!" -----! </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this point, Lily posed with her fists raised high (victory pose). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  little  human  girl  who  had  achieved  the  『minimum  necessary  condition』 </p>
<p class="calibre1">needed  for  victory  as  instructed  by  Gutsy  (Finn)-『Breakdown  of  the  first  level adventurer』even forgot the status quo and let out a wild cheer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was not the tough warriors, nor the cinderellas with full Bellies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather, it was the fall of the first level adventurers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  exactly  what  must  be  present  in  both  tactics  and  strategy,  the  absolute element. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's right, what is sought is 『one person』. The "first level adventurer (Hogni Ragnar)" that the commander (Lili) had been watching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  『form'  and  『preparation』,  Tsubaki's  struggle  with  Daphne  and  the  girls was paved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the final step was taken up by Ryu who arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was by no means a result of chance. It was the 'hope' that Lily and the others who were strangled by despair struggled to the end and relied on everyone to pull them through little by little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The direction is going to change ......! In this way, the direction will change!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only one victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was the most important victory of the faction warlord alliance, and the most severe defeat of the [Freya Familia]. The defeat of the unique "General", not the soldier, was sure to bring a storm. </p>

<p class="calibre1">On the main battlefield, which was silent unlike the city, the Gulliver brothers and other strong warriors who were fighting with the left flank of the allied army were stumped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hegeni-sama .................. has been defeated? How is it possible for ----!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Morale began to falter. Even the presence of the warlord (Hedin) could not stop the onslaught. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except  for  them  in  the  southeast  of  the  『main  battlefield』,  all  the  other  tough warriors were annihilated by Ryu's shelling. The turmoil immediately spread in all directions, so fast that it seemed to reach the main camp where the goddess was sitting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hai, Haiyid-sama! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p229"></a>"Hogni-sama! What the hell should I do--? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same goes for the Cinderellas with full Bellies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Panicked voices spilled out from the troop of healers and pharmacists consisting of only women, followed by </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--Shut up!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A loud shout from Haider quickly silenced the confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We are the Cinderellas with full Bellies! Fill up the dead warriors, and the healers! </p>
<p class="calibre1">By any degree, by any number!!! When warriors fall, we simply plug the wounds, awaken them, and send them to battle!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now she is not the usual gentle maiden, but reveals the appearance of a goddess worshiping, stern and cold demoness, blocking the shaking that is about to engulf the battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lord Hogni will be treated by me! He'll be on his feet in no time! Adjutants (Lorna), go  heal  the  other  strong  warriors!  Our  victory  is  rock-solid,  there  is  no  need  to panic!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, yes!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  being reprimanded by Haider, the girls in charge  of the  healing reluctantly calmed down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  healers  and  pharmacists  cooperated  with  each  other  and  quickly  prepared magic and props for the healing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Faction valve alliance, and [Blast]! Really dare to do ah! But even so, it's just that Lord Hogni has fallen! (Although morale will be affected, the battle situation is still, without a doubt, our overwhelming advantage!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">An extremely bitter expression surfaced in Haider's heart, but he adjusted his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The companions who were affected by Ryu's shelling had already been treated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After that, it would be enough to use the maximum capacity of the Cinderellas with full  stomachs  to  rebuild  the  battle  line.  The  girls  who  had  been  supporting  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Battle Wilderness" for so many years were able to do it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And this is the biggest regret that made Lily sigh. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had not been able to make a huge impact by wiping out the Haider girls in the opening game, and the storm had to be suppressed by them before it turned into a fierce fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We will not allow this to change! You will not be able to obtain 『Hope』!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  loyalty  to  the  goddess  in  her  chest,  the  young  girl  was  about  to  walk towards the fallen Hegyi. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just then. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p230"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a 'boom' to the Cinderellas with full stomachs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Haider was swept up in it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhhhh! ............ eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were hit by the shelling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rain of magic hit and burned the skin, causing damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haider, and the Cinderellas with full Bellies were all sniped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not a problem. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's not a problem, but it's fine up to this point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What was a problem was that the shelling came from behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And what attacked them was the projectile of lightning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(............ ha?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without an enemy, it was impossible to carry out the alert, their rear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haider slowly, stiffly, turned in the direction of 『Basecamp』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one standing there was a white elf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  warlord  who  rightfully  stood  there,  holding  a  long  sword  and  one  hand outstretched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin Selander. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He placed Haider and the others within the 『range distance』 that was neither too close nor too far for maximum effect, and then launched the barrage himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(........................... ..................... ha?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haider's head became blank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with the young girl who could never finish processing this information, Hedin merely uttered one sentence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Eternal Strife, the Indestructible Thunderbolt]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A merciless 'sweeping declaration' was spoken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Carruthers Hild]" </p>







<p class="calibre1">"Eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh eh! Hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p231"></a>hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey hey! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iltae kept screaming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He shouted out the hearts of everyone in the city, and the magic stone amplifier (microphone) almost fell to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait, wait, wait, really wait! I can't understand what's going on, so please wait a minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  the  ferocious  thunderbolt  projectile  descending  towards  the  Cinderellas with full Bellies, the city erupted again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  the  [Black  Demon  Sword]'s  breakthrough  alone  had  reached  the  ultimate frenzy, and to think that there was immediately another [White Demon Wand] doing </p>
<p class="calibre1">'incomprehensible acts' had surpassed the head's limit for processing information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  amount  of  information  that  seemed  to  be  exploding  made  it  impossible  for everyone to judge the situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The people first wondered if the 'Mirror of God' was malfunctioning. The gods cried out, 'How is that possible'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the adventurers understood that this was the reality, and in the end, it still led to a 'pandemonium'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Misfire! [White Demon Wand]'s miscalculation! Mistakenly shooting your own side as the enemy! No, but, now also shooting one after another ............ ah ah ah ah ah  ah  ah  totally  confused  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  ah  .........  ...!!!  Help  me Ganesha-sama!!! What the hell is going on? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is that Ganesha? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh my God, what the hell should I do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The situation was unmanageable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both  the  announcements  (Ibri)  and  the  commentary  (Ganesha)  were  useless, turning into noise generators that just drifted with the scene of the battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Including the gods,  『one word』 flashed through the minds of those who froze watching the battle in Orauli. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it was unbelievable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, this state of affairs was the only thing that could not happen within the Meijin faction that had sworn its loyalty to the Lord God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... betrayed ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone among the crowd in the central square whispered the word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The word gradually turned into a clamor and eventually turned into a violent and huge wave. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p232"></a>"[White Demon Wand] betrayed!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"ReBellion, reBellion! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Deceitful! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What a silly thing to say! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How is this possible! After all, he is - the Loyalty Wand (Hedin Selander)! </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the center of the wailing was a group of elfs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  White  Elfs,  who  were  cold,  stern,  and  more  loyal  than  anyone  else,  had conspired  against  them,  and  despite  the  reality  before  them,  some  of  them continued to express their disbelief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's the same as that time in [Apollo's familia]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a strong sense of vision, people could not help but shout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(--No.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Lili denied this statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the incredible sight, the girl wondered several times if she was mistaken, but at the same time, she asserted that her answer was 'no'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The『betrayal』that  had  happened  in  the  war  game  with  [Apollo's  Familia]  had happened  again-those  words  might  be  flashing  in  the  minds  of  the  people  of Orario, as well as the adventurers of the faction valve alliance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that is not the case. It was definitely not like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because that was a strategy used by Lily with『Transformation Magic (Zao Grey Girl)』. The villainous Luann did not fall back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, this sight is not a replay of that war game of yesteryear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, this is, truly -『Madness』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What Bell-sama said, is it really ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dumbfounded Lily muttered, while her consciousness flew back to a few hours ago. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Lily ...... can you hear something from me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the war game started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing Lily, who had finished inspiring the coalition of faction warlords, the white-haired boy seemed to have made up his mind and began with these words and spoke the main topic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I always feel that ...... Master ...... Hedin-san will help us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only Lily, the surrounding Hestia and the girls were astonished, while he said what he felt. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p233"></a>"I always felt that the world had changed because of 'charm', and when I was driven into a desperate situation ...... Master was helping me while beating me beyond recognition." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So you were beaten to death ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well,  sort  of.  ............  Well,  that,  anyway!  That  person  was  not  talking  to  "Bell Cranel of the Mishinpai valve" but to "the real me" or something ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">--It doesn't matter if you're a heretic or not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--Move forward. Never stop moving forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those were the words that were spoken to the young man (Bell) who was close to losing himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And on the "battle wilderness" at dusk, the sunset appeared behind, and there was a small smile like a vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I always felt that Hedin, who had been conducting a harsh "baptism", was perhaps teaching his unworthy pupil to do so, trying to lead him to a certain place, and Bell expressed it in vague words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  always  feel  that  compared  to  Mr.  Van  or  Mr.  Aron  and  the  others,  there  is something  different  about  the  master  ......  uh  even  so,  he  will  not  become  our companion, or this matter should not be possible ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Contrary to the absurd and nonsensical 『conception』, Bell's head was lowered, and several times he wanted to say something, and finally raised his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Maybe, before the date with Miss Syr ...... Master was acting just for 『that person』 ......... ...Now, that's what I think." </p>
<p class="calibre1">So the Master might be using us to help us out -. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like an apprentice who couldn't guess what the master was thinking, but still chose to believe in general, Bell said so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since it was an 'assumption' that could never be counted on, it was impossible for Lily, the commander-in-chief, to believe it all. That's why she said, "Lily thinks that the possibility of 'that kind of thing' happening is extremely low. Bell agreed, and said with a smile that it would be good if it stayed in the corner of her heart for a while. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Did you guess this premonition of Bell-sama's ......? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily pulled her consciousness up from the sea of memories and looked ahead in astonishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rain of thunderbolts was still flying around aiming at the Cinderellas with full stomachs. This scene, which could be seen from a grave far away, was a scene where Bell's 'assumption' became reality and no longer needed to be proven. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p234"></a>She did not know what Hedin was thinking. Both the true meaning and the truth remain hidden in the darkness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, if only the irrefutable fact was intercepted, it was that Hedin  Selander, the first rank adventurer, had-- </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He has fallen to the faction alliance! </p>







<p class="calibre1">"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haider let out a scream that sounded like a cry of grief and a roar of rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  lightning  bombs  that  kept  coming  shot  out  in  unison.  The  healer  and  the medicine man were hit and sent flying, one after another, and fell to the ground, except  for  her,  whose  whole  body  was  trembling,  and  all  her  emotions  became extremely agitated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the hell are you doing? What are you doing, Hedin-sama! </p>
<p class="calibre1">She performed a "high-speed recovery" on her burnt body, swept away a lightning bolt with her long staff, and looked angrily at the figure in front of her sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you still mentally fit to target our companions! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The long light red hair without the hairpin rose and fell as if to show the girl's anger, and  Hedin,  who  shot  out  all  the  seventy-eight  summoned  Thunderbolts  (magic bullets), replied flatly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course it's normal. How could I have misfired." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I followed my own decision and decided to annihilate you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic formation unfolding under his feet rose up with new magic power, as if signaling his will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The red coral pupils in the depths of his glasses did not show the color of madness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  a  sage's  sensible  gaze,  which  was  also  familiar  to  Haider,  Hedin  calmly continued to do the 'brutal act'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time it was the number of hundreds of white thunderbolts floating in the air, aiming this way again, and the young girl's fist trembled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p235"></a>"Does  that  mean  you  want  to  betray  Freya-sama?  As  a  loyal  subject,  you!  I believed that even if the whole world was against her, only the headmaster and you would always protect that lord! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't judge me by your self-talking standards, fool. I'm going to throw up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin said to the shouting Haider, bored from the bottom of his heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And I don't even intend to trap Freya-sama with treacherous tricks." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sh......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I committed the crime for『Loyalty』. I'm saying that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, in order that  even the  present Haider could understand, he changed to  a simpler statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The same as that woman ...... Daughter of the Gods (Horn)." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the name of Haider's colleague. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't know what she thought of it herself. But Haider inexorably felt that she was an awkward girl, sometimes taking care of her, sometimes empathizing, and had felt  that  she  was  one  of  the  few  『friends』  she  had,  was  such  a  name  of  a </p>
<p class="calibre1">『betrayer』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... you are also ...... even you!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  emotion  that  I  felt  when  I  knew  that  my  friend  (Horn)  had  betrayed  the goddess, now awoke again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A traitor to the Goddess who committed the same act as Horn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment he realized this, Haider put aside his confusion and became furious like a fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shame on you, traitor! Freya-sama's divine will is absolute! If you deviate from his divine will, what right do you have to talk about loyalty and righteousness? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Talking to fanatical gods (you) is tiring. And it's a waste of time. --Lie down." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The thunder shot came again mercilessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though only Haider was left standing, the lightning strikes kept falling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This thing! </p>
<p class="calibre1">His body was continuously hit, his whole body was burned or gouged, and his limbs were occasionally almost split apart, but even so, the pattern of light that surfaced on the surface of his skin immediately eliminated Haider's damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Asa Gurvig]! Not even a first level adventurer can kill me completely! I am Haider Velvet - the magical girl who received the golden gift of Freya-sama! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The endless regeneration effect released the magic light that could be called gold, and kept healing Haider. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p236"></a>The  "Automatic  Healing"  that  even  "Clouseau's  Magic  Sword"  couldn't  break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it was a Lv. 4 magic, it resisted Hedin's powerful shot (Karus Hild), and its effect could only be described as threatening, and it was beyond the norm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As long as I am here, the Tough Warriors and the Cinderellas with full stomachs will not die! Lord Freya will be guarded by me!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rage made her brain boil and Haider became berserk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was bathed in countless lightning bullets and her body shook, but still stepped out and tried to move forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't make any noise, you pig." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sh--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin spoke with extreme boredom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can't you kill it? Idiot, your 'magic' is not eternal, it has a limit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's troublesome to even explain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He showed such an expression and continued to maintain the blast while saying more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You have to have mental power to activate magic. Everyone knows that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  amount  of  Haider's  spiritual  power  was  far  beyond  that  of  healers  and magicians of the same level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The super long-lasting amount of replies that even beat the Holy Maiden (Amid) was one of the reasons that caused the Faction Alliance to suffer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Which side do you think has more spiritual power, me or you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin Selander. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  strongest  magician  in  the  city  (Rivelia  Leos  Alph)  would  agree,  a  magical cannon swordsman who prides himself on having the most total amount of spiritual power in the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haider's mind, which was burning with burning anger, was poured with a dish of cold water, and time froze for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The result speaks for itself as to who will use up their strength first." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Meanwhile the firing picked up speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The swarm of fury surpassed the amount of Hayd's recovery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Healed, recovered, recovered, yet still penetrated by the tip of the thunder lance and scorched by the lightning incessantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haider's gold (magic) creaked and groaned, stopped advancing, and finally rested his knees against the earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p237"></a>Haider, who was constantly attacked by the electric flying foam, saw that while at the mercy of the impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  depths  of  the  vision,  that  insulting  expression  surfaced  from  the  decent looking elf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your 『gold』 is just a thing of unbecoming goddess - it's not even as good as the daughter of the gods (Horn). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf pointed out the jealousy she harbored for the Daughter of the Gods (Horn) deep inside her heart and let out a sharp sarcasm, causing the young girl's eyes to widen and she let out a scream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lightning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crushing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the brutal shelling stopped, what lay on the ground was the no longer eternal </p>
<p class="calibre1">'golden wreckage'. </p>







<p class="calibre1">"Hedin Selander ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu looked very shocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  after  defeating  the  black  elfs,  the  lightning  light  was  launched  like  a  speed attack, and all the Cinderellas with full stomachs were destroyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unexpected things happened in a few moments, and just as she stopped moving </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Blizzard! You go northwest!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice of Hedin, who had defeated the witch (Haider), gave instructions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In front of the amphitheater, the stupid rabbit ...... [Rabbit foot] was fighting with Ottar! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That rabbit alone won't do! You go and think of something!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fellow warlord smoothly commanded Ryu who was closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shocked for just a moment, Ryu immediately asked the other side in return. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p238"></a>"Are  you  asking  me  to  listen  to  the  rival  faction  (Freya's  Familia)!  To  make  me believe that you have betrayed me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your  unmanageable  healer  has  already  been  cleaned  up.  Isn't  that  enough  to convince you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  after  saying  that,  he  released  a  lightning  bomb  floating  on  the  front  of  his shoulder - a magic that was in 『standby state』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The target was Ryu, behind her. The orc who had sneaked closer and was covered in bruises 「Gooah! He cried out and fell to the ground. This is a tough warrior who used his companion as a shield and barely survived the wide area shelling (Bright Wind). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the speedy shot that had protected himself and was extremely washed out, Ryu glared this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... I have trouble accepting reality. It can be said that it is shaking." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In my opinion you are in an unusual enough state of affairs that is unexpected. All because of you, I had to advance the 『plan』." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She jumped up high and landed some distance apart, confronting Hedin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike the words, the two white elfs calmly said what was on their minds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"However, after advancing it also gained the corresponding value and meaning." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I will use you. You can use me too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Please answer me a question. Why would you do such a thing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin's answer was only one sentence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It goes without saying - for the sake of my 'master'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Empty-colored eye pupils and red coral eye pupils crossed their eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The same long golden hair fluttered in the dusty battlefield wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a moment, Ryu decided to trust the eyes of this compatriot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm going to Bell's side. What are you going to do after that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My thunder annihilation is more efficient than your wind. I'll catch up with you after I've cleared them all. Go on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin turned around and unfolded the magic formation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stopped looking at Ryu, revealing the determination hidden in his heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am the one who committed the foolish act. It will be this sinner (me) who commits more crimes by defiling the goddess' feet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I will not give it to anyone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin said that, and started the shelling of the [Freya's familia] base camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gahhhhhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the hell is going on, Hedin-sama? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p239"></a>"Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rain of lightning  shot through the strong warriors who were on standby one after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although he left the main god (Freya) in the temple area in the 『House of God』 </p>
<p class="calibre1">on the westernmost side of the island and moved the location of the base camp, it was  still  a  sweeping  shot  that  discarded  the  hesitation.  The  [Freya's  familia] </p>
<p class="calibre1">reserve battle force that was left behind like the faction valve alliance was swept away before it could make an appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stone slabs exploded and the surrounding area was hit by a storm of electric shocks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"F, Freya-sama! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lord Hedin has attacked the base camp! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The change reached Freya directly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the report from the guards who rushed in, the goddess looked shocked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......? Hedin ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">To Freya, this was also something unexpected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because even Freya had not doubted Hedin's 『loyalty』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the war games, even in the face of the Eye of God, Hedin's loyalty didn't have 『Lies』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I will not pray for forgiveness, Freya-sama. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin murmured as he imagined the expression the goddess would show now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is my selfish desire. Let me use the brand of sinners as the price - to run you through." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Along with the 'realization', Hedin unleashed an even more violent barrage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both the enemy and I, all of them were shocked by the lightning attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Freya's Familia] base camp, and the left flank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The 『main battlefield』 all included in the range circle of 『sweeping』 stirred up the so-called battle situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「「「「 What are you doing, Hedin!!! 」」」」 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The four Gulliver brothers dodged all the incoming magic bullets or shot them down with their weapons with great emotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Tough Warriors were helpless against the unceasing threats and fell one by one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with the ultra-precise shots that merely shot through [Freya's Familia] and the fierce destructive power, even adventurers of at least Lv. 3 were no longer able to  stand  up.  The  Cinderellas  who  would  revive  their  full  Bellies  were  no  longer </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p240"></a>there. After the loss of the resurrection of the add-on, they and they have long been reduced to an ordinary adventurer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  'strongest  formation'  that  once  caused  so  much  pain  to  the  faction's  allied forces began to melt with the naked eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sorrow and roar came in the wind, and Hedin didn't answer, but just started talking to himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I did say that this is the strongest formation." </p>
<p class="calibre1">-- Within the range that my voice can reach, the dependents will move like an arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--This is the most efficient method. This is the strongest formation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These are the words that Hedin himself said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  strong  warrior  who  has  the  ability  to  manipulate  "individuals"  like  an  absolute mind. It is true that there is a powerful destructive power that can even override the [Loki Familia] that is known for its power of "organization". </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But,  if  the  commander  (me)  falls  or  betrays  -  it  will  be  reduced  to  the  'weakest formation'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, this formation of [Freya's Familia] relies too much on Hedin, even more than Guts (Finn) for [Loki's Familia]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, if there is some kind of 'malfunction' in the mind, it will disintegrate instantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  chain  of  command  was  already  equivalent  to  non-existence.  The  tough warriors who are too much inclined to fight scurry around, and at that moment the elfs  who  have  accurately  grasped  the  plate  will  put  in  sniping  even  somewhat ruthlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There is nothing the least bit unbelievable about this sight. It is the natural result." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who is the one who has the greatest 『magic firepower』 in this war game? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Hedin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Who has the longest range in this battlefield? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Hedin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this battle, who knew the configuration of both sides better than anyone else, and who had a good grasp of the battle situation? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was all Hedin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hedin  Selander's  defection  was  the  only  "strategy"  that  plunged  this  battlefield into irreversible chaos. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've been saving my spiritual power. Don't worry, I will destroy them all and leave no one behind." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The 'fall of the first level adventurer' will demoralize the ten thousand troops. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p241"></a>What about the betrayal of the first level adventurers? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's simple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's despair. </p>







<p class="calibre1">"It's tilted!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn's eyes widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's tilted! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermes was stunned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's tilting! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iltae did let out a loud voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The scales! [Freya's Familia] Overwhelmingly superior battle situation! Because of a ghostly elf, there is no doubt that it is tilted! </p>
<p class="calibre1">A magnificent cannon fire erupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the explosion, it was still an explosion, and the momentum was so intense that  it  was  going  to  cover  the  entire  『main  battlefield』.  The  sight  of  the overwhelming ravages bred by the continuous and unceasing shelling (Karus Hild), the Labyrinth City was surrounded by a third shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even a layman seeing this sight knew that the loss of that strongest faction valve was heavy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This situation surpassed even the anticipation of Guts (Finn), and even the gods (Hermes) failed to read it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course. Even the main god Freya did not even think for a moment that such a thing might happen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in any case, the battle situation did change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Less  than  fifty  percent  of  the  battle  force  remained!  Except  for  the  'White  and Black Twin Riders', the main battle force of the first rank adventurers was still alive! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, the tough warrior and the full-Bellied Cinderella were defeated, which meant that Freya-sama had no backhand ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  『Tower  of  Babel』  where  cheers  and  curses  intermingled,  Hermes unconsciously poked his body out towards the 『Mirror』. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p242"></a>There  were  also  many  gods  out  of  the  faction  warriors,  and  only  four  faction warriors remained, [Hestia Familia], [Miach Familia], [Hathor Familia], and [Plutos Familia]. The number of Familias that can still fight is less than thirty. The alliance was already a false name and could be said to be close to destruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the [Freya Familia] was also the same, except for the troops of the East led by Allen and the escort troops of the 'House of God', the other strong warriors were almost completely destroyed. The regiments under the four Gulliver brothers are still fleeing frantically under the shelling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To put it in an extreme way, if we use the remaining troops to hold back the first rank adventurers (Ottar and them) and then put together a battle force to attack</p>
<p class="calibre1">『God's House』, the faction valve alliance should be able to come to the Queen (Queen) whose defenses are weak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Unlike so far! There is no doubt that there is still a chance to win! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gazing at the side of the white elf's face reflected in the "mirror", the gods shouted out a cheer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, in the base of the [Loki Familia], Finn also had the same feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ottar and Allen are far away, which is crucial ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sat on top of the bench, the edges of his words oozing with excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  head  (first)  and  deputy  head  (second)  of  [Freya's  Familia].  If  these  two cooperate with each other, even Hedin's betrayal will be suppressed, I'm afraid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strongest in the city and the fastest in the city, their『power』and『speed』</p>
<p class="calibre1">combined, is such a powerful thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it was due to Hedin's instructions that Aron was now on the easternmost side of the island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If it was replaced with a queue, it would be an extremely long stretched column. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not  to  mention  that  Ottar  is  fighting  in  the  northwestern  part  of  the  urban  ruins, which is not a distance that can be filled in an instant, even at the fastest speed in the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let Allen aim at the gods and buy distance and time! "『Shedding his own flesh and  breaking  his  bones』  ......  Lili  Luka,  who  failed  to  carry  out  the  battle,  was snatched by him!!! </p>
<p class="calibre1">This 『snatching』 act made Finn, who was overlooking the plate outside, exclaim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the one who was indignant that "Don't be ridiculous" was the one who was completely robbed of the battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the hell is this? He stole all the benefits ----!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the grave, Lilly shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p243"></a>That's for sure. She was almost strangled by the tension and weight of the thought that the battle that she had thought up only in the heat of her mind had been so simply  taken  and  used.  Add  to  that  the  fact  that  what  she  had  failed  to  do,  her opponent  had  done  with  ease,  and  the  feelings  of  frustration  and  inferiority depicted a negative spiral in her small body, triggering a big explosion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What kind of fetishistic and high-minded elf is that? I think it's a super dark and spooky elf...! </p>
<p class="calibre1">She kept stomping on the ground in anger. Her arms and legs were flailing about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While Lily was screaming like this with tears in her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She's probably saying these stupid things, don't get me wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin guessed beforehand that the little human girl was crying out and said softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's  all  your  fault.  Your  instructions  were  excellent.  Be  proud,  your  plan  can  be used directly by me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was because the configuration, command and tactics were very clever that Hedin was able to steal Lily's combat. To put it more strictly, he judged its value of having been snatched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was because of Lily's presence that led to the current form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Really ~~~~~!!! Haruhime-sama, Aisha-sama! Please back up a little more with the  battle  whore!  Ignore  the  enemies  and  stuff  ignore  ignore  ignore  ignore,  just ignore! Use them as shields to defend against shelling!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, yes, Lili-sama!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know! Who wants to be affected by that exaggerated magic?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The proof was that Lily was using magic props to communicate and give accurate instructions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was doing so even before Hedin showed his obvious defection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, the tough warriors couldn't even grab the allied adventurers as『shields』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aisha  and the girls unknowingly  broke away from the left flank, fully converging with Haruhime and the others' reserve, and then surprisingly prepared to regroup with the grave front. That had been the location of the Tsubaki and their central unit that had been completely destroyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And there was a location that would not block Hedin's 『ray』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nice work. But, that's how it should be." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The enemy commander (Lily) was the first to predict the situation and prepared for Hedin's reversal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be precise, it was Hedin who made her prepare for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He gave the signal beforehand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p244"></a>Advancing  the  [Freya's  familia]  base  camp  to  a  more  forward  position,  the cinderellas  who  were  close  to  full  stomachs,  like  a  coded  signal,  revealed  the possibility  of  『reBellion』  that  only  a  commander  who  was  also  on  the  scene could understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not that he is very optimistic about the ability of the enemy commander (Lili) whom he has not seen a few times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather, he trusted the "rotten Guts (Finn)" behind her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If he had been taught by that brave man, he would have been able to detect it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin even used this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the cafe (Visser), Finn said that he would teach Lily this information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not a conspiracy with Finn in advance. This is Hedin's dictum. In the end, for the 'Renegade Plan' to succeed, it had to fool both the enemy and his own side, and it was impossible to share it with others. If Hedin and Lily secretly colluded, they would definitely be seen through by the sharp-nosed Aron and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  『Mirror』,  the  villainous  brave  man  perceived everything and one showed a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Lili  Luka  Yathi  ......  I'm  afraid  she  used  the  reason  of  me  retaining  my  spiritual power as a starting point and finally perceived the possibility of『reBellion』.) Except for the initial shot that took away Daphne and Lily's consternation, the rest of the time Hedin deliberately did not release the shelling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ravages after that were handed over to Hogni and the others, and for the sake of this moment, the mental power was reserved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily was probably fearful of the shelling that might be released at any moment, yet felt  defiant  at  the  lack  of  any  intention  to  fire  again.  She  put  all  the  elements together and perceived the 'destination' of this side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She resisted the great pressure, but kept her speculations without solid evidence in order to make use of Hedin - Lily would have made such a decision thanks to the teenager's (Bell) "suggestion (assumption)" that pushed her in the end, which Hedin naturally did not know. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I admit it. I admit. prum, you are very capable. Much more astute than that stupid rabbit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin sent his best compliment - if the teenager had heard it he would have cried on the ground - while correcting the position of his glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  wasn't  just  Lily,  he  knew  it  was  offensive,  but  the  divine  will  of  the  main  god (Freya) that suddenly commanded to switch course was also utilized by him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p245"></a>It was thanks to that that he was able to keep the urban speediest (Aron) away from  the  "main  battlefield".  If  it  was  Hedin's  instructions,  it  would  have  led  to discontent, and in the worst case, he might have suspected Hedin of reBellion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also including [Blast] the reinforcements, 『Chance』 rolled in like an avalanche, and he did not let go of even one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Taking the huge number of options, the battle situation today was completely in his hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just  for  this  moment,  a  large  part  of  the  faction  warlord  alliance  army  was sacrificed. Even if we calculate the damage, the situation is still unfavorable." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the rewards are great, so are the risks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like a king taking a once-in-a-lifetime gamble, Hedin had to make a "big gamble". </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's how powerful [Freya's Familia] is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"However, those who are able to do so remain." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia's familia], etc., still had a hand that could be used to win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the chance of winning still exists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In  order  to  fulfill  my  expectations  -  and  to  make  the  lord  aware  of  her </p>
<p class="calibre1">"expectations" - let me help you. Work hard for me, adventurers." </p>







<p class="calibre1">「「「「 Hedin! Damn you!!! 」」」」 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfrigg and the others were exceptionally angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bias can not betray  the most  - although  very annoying but the only one did not doubt his loyalty - the subject fell to the traitor. The quadruplets' anger easily broke through the boundary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That shit plays dumb with glasses! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How far is he going to go crazy!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Purge!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let him be completely cut off!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The successive lightning bolts were still intimidating the side. More critical was the fact  that  the  lifeline  of  the  faction  valve,  the  full-Bellied  Cinderellas,  was  all  but extinguished. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p246"></a>The  scales  had  tipped.  The  great  crimes  committed  by  Hedin  are  innumerable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The four brothers let out a roar that sent shivers down the spines of both the enemy and us, and ignored the Paired Valve alliance and were about to launch a surprise attack on the hated white elfs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the </p>



<p class="calibre1">The sound of a fist boomed at that moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The sound of a fist boomed at that moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The powerful blow smashed through the earth and blew away the strong warriors who were running around to escape the lightning bombs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling the impact coming from the rear, the four Gulliver brothers had to stop in their tracks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「「「「 What is it this time!? 」」」」 </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  turned  around  violently,  looking  very  anxious,  and  the  one  who  made  the answer was several black shadows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Meows? When a run is a partner of justice meow! I'm going to use all my strength to ride on the righteous familia members (Ryu)'s coattails! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where can I find a partner of justice like you? You're not a righteous partner, you black cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the depths of the rising sand and dust, the black shadow of the orc who was playing with a dagger shifted uncontrollably. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black shadow of the human pulled out his fist, which was deeply rooted in the ground, and stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wind that flowed into the huge depression blew away the sand and dust, and the group that had made its appearance emerged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've come to pay back what I owe you, my little brothers! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Meow --------- ---------- ---I've come to pay you back, little brothers! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa Faust roared as she punched her right fist into her left palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After her 『Declaration of War』, the inspiring voices of the cats such as Chloe also resounded all around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's ......! Runoa-sama, Chloe-sama!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Those people ...... are from the tavern! </p>
<p class="calibre1">First the still-transparent Haruhime was startled, and then Aisha was also taken aback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「「「「 Mistress of Abundance!!!」」」」 </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p247"></a>The four Gulliver brothers shrugged off the words in disgust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The staff of the tavern『Mistress of Plenty』were all here. Instead of the tender leaf-colored uniform, they were wearing their respective battle attire. Runoa wore a short top and scarf that showed her Belly button, and Chloe was wearing a short cloak  with  a  hood.  Including  the  other  sales  clerks,  they  all  carried  apparently unusual weapons and exuded a full battle spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Reinforcements ......? I can't believe there are more after Ryu-sama!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lilly likewise saw the 『Mistress of Abundance』 crowd appear in the southeast of the 『Main Battlefield』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not to mention the Lv. 4 Runoa and the other sales clerks, all of whom had the aura of a superior adventurer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here they are. The residents of the "Strongest Tavern" in the Maze City. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, we've lost a lot of enemies and companions. We're already here in a hurry..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're completely late. It's all the fault of a stupid cat from somewhere." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chloe looked around, wagging her tail leisurely, while Runoa cocked the corner of her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It didn't take long for a cat person to walk out from the back of the group. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--Come back meow. My former home (Freya's familia)." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The golden shoulder pads that shone in the sun, the lance with golden decoration engraved on it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The few remaining strong warriors were talking at the sight of the figure they had seen before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Chariot Half Wheel] ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anya Fromel!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The surprised voices were all directed towards the former member of the group (Anya). </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  the  confusion  spread  to  the  eastern  part  of  the  island,  far  from  the  『main battlefield』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Allen-sama! The lightning strike that kept going on just now, that was really Hedin-sama giving his companion-! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That maggot ......! What is that maggot thinking? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen and Tough Warrior, who were hunting the gods, noticed the difference in the base camp. Hearing the information brought back by the scouts who rushed to the central part of the island and turned back in a hurry, Arun was furious, and after hearing the follow-up report, he turned even more pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Also,  the  reinforcements  of  the  Mistress  of  Bountiful  were  also  found  by  ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among them is the figure of [Chariot Half-Wheel]--" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p248"></a>"--what!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The man in charge of reconnaissance was frightened by the look that had gone beyond  anger  to  hatred.  The  man  in  charge  of  the  reconnaissance  didn't  know what to say. The tough warriors all drew in a cold breath as he gripped his silver lance with a strength that seemed to break it and stared at the west. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That, Chronicler!!!" </p>

<p class="calibre1">Symbolizing  the  warriors  of  the  hell  of  yesteryear,  their  eyes  pierced  through Anya's body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elder brother somewhere in the island must have found out as well, and I'm afraid he spat on himself like a blazing fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya, who was surrounded by her own  heartache - but kept looking ahead, not timid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A mere abandoned cat! Why don't you die!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haven't  you  already  been  broken  hearted  by  Allen  and  Freya-sama  -  no,  Syr-sama! </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was when the city was turned into a "box" by "Charm". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  blood  relative  gave  further  blows.  The  goddess  revealed  the  secret  in  the worst form. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing  the  insults  and  accusations  from  Duvaline  and  Alfrigg,  one  of  the  four brothers, Anya nodded meekly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's disheartened meow. No, the heart is torn into pieces and becomes a mess ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">everything is confused meow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Quiet, somewhat lonely voices, Runoa and Chloe did not say a word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But, never again will I be confused." </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, she changed her appearance again and looked powerfully ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking further than the Gulliver brothers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking towards the westernmost side of the island where a『girl』would be, the direction of 『God's House』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Meow is coming to save Syr's meow! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ania surfaced with an expression that cleared the gloom and let her determination spread throughout the battlefield. </p>





<p class="calibre1"><a id="p249"></a> </p>

<p class="calibre1">Time went back in time. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"What are you doing here, goddess of waste." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's the matter~ It's not a tavern~" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the war game started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the tavern "Mistress of Plenty" with the sign "Closed", a pillar of gods was sitting at the counter, with one hand on his face, drinking. Needless to say, it was none other than Loki. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to her, the only person left in the store was the owner, the boss's wife, Mia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, Mia mother ~ ...... not go to war games? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because Mia does not give her wine, they even bring their own wine over to play drunken goddess from Bellow secretly looking at Mia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, even though the vermillion eyes looked upward, Mia did not change her attitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go back. It's the same as coming several times." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as Mia said, Loki visited 『Mistress of Plenty』 every day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be precise, he had been trying to 'convince' her like this before the war game's decision was made. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The actual fact is that you can't get a lot of money from the company. Although it's a bit annoying to let the little one take advantage of us, we've decided to secretly try to defeat Freya this time~" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What does that have to do with me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And the Familiasmen (Bert) are also very annoyed. The familia members are also very angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first time I heard that, I don't know how many times I heard it, Mia showed a helpless expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She wiped her glass, as if to say that I will not accompany the drunken people to play drunken crazy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, Mia's mom. Do you want to know what the multiplier is for this war game? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How could I possibly know? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"100 to 0. All the gods bet on that nymphomaniac." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So the head of the board gave up. Today's war is just a game for show. It's all the fault of that douchebag from the guild, it's a public execution. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p250"></a>The first thing you need to do is to get a good idea of what you're doing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What three big adventurers commission well, stupid ~, stupid ~. She muttered one after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But ...... there is also a kind of 99 to 1 with 'conditions'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the goddess swept away that frivolous attitude just now and lifted her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mia mom, it's the case of you joining the faction warlord alliance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Former head of [Freya's Familia], Mia Grande. Lv. 6 ...... [Little Giant]. If you fall back then you have a slight chance, that's the general prediction." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was before that Ottar became the headmaster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  who  was  half  separated  from  [Freya's  Familia]  during  the  『Dark  period』, was able to say that she passed the cruel 『Baptism』 with a snicker. She was very familiar with Freya and the girls, and now she who still had the beauty god's </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Grace』 engraved on her back, if she joined the faction warlord alliance, it would not only be a ready-made battle force, but it would be more likely to become an </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Ace』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Mia remained silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today's situation was different from the time when the "Box" was constructed. In front of Freya, who was ready to give up everything for the sake of Bell, she couldn't act easily - it could be seen from how much effort Hestia and Hermes, who were running around to break the 'charm', had gone through - and it was understandable to take a hundred steps back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But now it was different. Freya couldn't use "Charm" anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no reason to become negative. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You obviously pushed the teenager, but you won't help him?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia wiped her cup. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other than that, there was no other action. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's not like her at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The godly eyes that saw through everything and her own level of stupidity made her extremely bored and sighed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... I made a 'contract' with that goddess." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Contract'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"When  I  encounter  my  mate  (Odr),  I  don't  make  a  move  to  hinder,  it's  such  a contract. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia omitted the details and told the story of the past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The story of a dwarf who met a goddess in a flower field when he was very young. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p251"></a>"The story of a young man who met a goddess in a field of flowers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I think so." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're a fool ...... and then you keep this kind of contract in a disciplined way? </p>
<p class="calibre1">You Mia Grande?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reaction of Loki, Mia did not blame much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia also can't see what the god of beauty did this time, so she had both 'resistance' </p>
<p class="calibre1">and 'reBellion'. She was forced into a desperate situation while still struggling. Bell felt something, and pushed him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, you can also think of it this way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If she hadn't done anything at that time, the goddess of beauty would have gotten a partner (Odd). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if it was in a very ugly and twisted form, at least her 'expectation' was partially fulfilled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What do you think, when I first met that goddess, she was doing?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......? Didn't she say 'become my familia member~' in a domineering way like now? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She was crying. She was sitting in a field of flowers with her hands over her face." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loki couldn't believe it and his eyes widened as Mia took her eyes off of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「My starting point with that guy wasn't the goddess. It's the 『girl』 side. ...... I learned that side is the essence of that goddess." </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Girl』 was sobbing alone in that field of flowers at dusk, and that figure is still etched in her eyes now, unable to forget. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, Freya had not yet entered into a contract with Horn, and naturally, she did not have the appearance of a 'girl'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it was reflected in Mia's pupils. To her, the goddess crying in the flower field was just a lonely "girl". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chloe, Runoa, and Anya ...... my silly girls here were bullied and made me furious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So I pushed the kid." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But that nymphomaniac you're talking about is one of those silly girls for me, too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was thinking ...... this time, if I even betrayed her and gave her a punch ...... that fool might be broken ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia put down the cup she was wiping and shook her head feebly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the confusion, and hesitation that only she, who had the most contact with </p>
<p class="calibre1">『girls』 among the dependents, could understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p252"></a>She gazed at the fist that had beaten the goddess hard, but now could not raise it, and closed her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loki silently looked out at such a dwarf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's understand now, you can't let go of both『Freya』and 『Little Syr』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But, Mia. We've been friends with her longer than you, right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this point, Loki smiled cunningly as he brought up the matter of the heavenly era. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After all, that was a super defiant and annoying queen. To put it bluntly, she must be thinking that now, she can no longer clean up the situation, simply break the can to go forward to count ~" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... What do you want to say?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If Freya herself wants to find a compromise, will you help? </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if not wanting to be led by the gods' words, Mia did not reverse her will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As long as that silly girl herself does not ask for help, I will not go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loki was hanging his mouth like a clown who saw his prey on the hook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's what you said, oh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What does ...... mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get the promise." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gods stood up and said so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come with us, Mia." </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the labyrinth city, the base camp of many [families] had been empty since the day before the war games. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Needless to say, this was due to the move to the "Orza City Ruins". Most of the factions, led by the [Hestia Familia], applied to the guild and the urban gendarmerie (Ganesha  Familia)  to  protect  their  base.  Some  of  these  [families]  also  asked friendly factions that were not involved in the war to watch over their families, or left a few members behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya's familia] is the latter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Including the guild, no one would openly side with them who had distorted the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, Freya didn't want to ask for help in this situation. Therefore, in the wide </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Battle  Wilderness』,  about  twenty  upper  level  adventurers  and  low  level adventurers stayed here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The assets accumulated by the largest faction of the city (Freya's familia) were too large to count. The "Battle Wilderness", where the guards were undoubtedly weak, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p253"></a>was a mountain of treasure. But even so, there were no fools who wanted to enter it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Most of the city,  especially the gods who run all the factions,  had no doubt that Freya would be the winner of the war. Even if they do something to steal the gold and  silver  now,  they  will  definitely  be  destroyed  by  the  triumphant  and  strong warriors afterwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  no  one  who  was  not  afraid  of  death  would  want  to  invade,  let  alone attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The premise is to except 『them』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Release~~~open~~~me~~~meow ~~~~!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya's loud volume echoed all around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her feet snapped, and the one who held her against her shoulders - was a 『Wolf Man』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let go of Meow, [Ferocious Wolf]! This is abducting a human, no it's abducting a cat~~~!  How  dare  you  imitate  the  voice  of  the  elder  brother  and  kidnap  meow, that's evil meow~~! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who would imitate that shit cat! Don't joke around, stupid cat!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After Runoa left, it was this Bert who appeared in Anya's room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The unconcerned attitude, the rude demeanor, and the rough tone of voice. This werewolf had the same characteristics as the catman's older brother. Anya, who mistook the visit of her elder brother, looked up, and instantly her eyes glazed over before she was brought straight over. It was to this 『Battle Wilderness』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lie down, you! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo ah ah ah ah!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The group members of [Freya's Familia] rushed towards the side of them who were making a fuss, but they were instantly silenced by a kick from Burt. Even though they were carrying Anya on their right shoulder and couldn't use one of their hands, it was impossible for a barely qualified guard to stop a Lv.6 trespasser. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How dare you break into the 'Battle Wilderness' meow ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who had been blushing was none other than Anya. She was trembling at the sight of such a desperate act of attacking the base of [Freya's Familia], even as a former member of the group. No, it was because she was a former member that she was as scared as dirt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's so bad that she's even more vicious than her older brother. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't  always  compare  that  shit  cat  to  me!!!  Do  you  think  I  enjoy  doing  such troublesome things!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya on her shoulder wilted completely, while Bert yelled at her in annoyance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p254"></a>"Remember that shit goddess ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A few days ago, furious at not being able to participate in the war and forced to shut up under Gareth's iron fist, he was going around destroying things to vent his anger. At that moment, her main god slithered over a few times and said quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We have a trick to make Freya's gang look bad. Do you want to do it with us? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although I was too angry at that time (before I agreed to her), but at that time I must have been out of my mind, Burt muttered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously, he would be used by her like this! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where have you been going with this meow meow! Based so deep in the land, even Meow has never been here meow! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The palace-like mansion was very quiet. As if to prove that all the members of the guard had been exterminated, the only sound that resounded in the spacious, long, white corridor was Bert's footsteps. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who knows? I'm just following the 'smell'!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... 'smell'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burt wiggled his excellent orcish nose and ran up the long staircase to reach the fifth floor of the mansion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before Anya's doubts melted away, they reached the spacious room located on the west side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the general sacred atmosphere of the church, the room was clean and white. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ceiling was high, and in the room, there was only a bed located in the middle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A young girl with light gray hair was lying there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya, who was put on the floor, didn't know what to say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She stopped moving when she saw the girl sleeping like a dead person in the large room that looked like a gap between heaven and earth where spirits wandered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually, Anya reflexively tried to run to her side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hir... um!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't make any noise." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only to be stopped by a hand extended by Burt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His main god (Loki) had long known about the relationship between the goddess (Freya) and her squire (Horn). </p>
<p class="calibre1">So Burt, who had heard her, also knew who the 『girl』 in front of his sight really was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The werewolf who  got『Girl』from the main god  and came here after the  smell said to her with the sight to keep quiet. Anya whose mouth was gagged reluctantly nodded her head in response. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p255"></a>「...... this is Syr meow? Syr ...... isn't Freya-sama meow?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">「...... is similar to  『Mirror』. What this guy said is basically equal to what the woman at the tavern said from her heart." </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  the  only  secret  method  is  activated,  the  squire  (Horn)  and  the  goddess (Freya) will share five senses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  the  war  games  had  started  long  ago  now,  they  naturally  lowered  their voices  in  order  not  to  make  the  goddess  (Freya)  aware  of  the  current  situation, among  them,  Bert,  who  did  not  want  to  make  complicated  explanations,  simply conveyed the truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya  looked  down  at  the  one  that  looked  exactly  like  『Syr』  with  a  thought  of disbelief - no, it was 『Syr』 herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bed also looked like a box-shaped coffin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl's eyes were quietly closed as if she had entered eternal sleep. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her heart became sad, her chest was so painful that she was about to sit on the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ania understood exactly why the rude werewolf had brought herself here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go and ask her, he was saying so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ask what is true and what is a lie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had pushed Anya to the breaking point, and where was her true meaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Anya couldn't ask. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now she was scared to death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Afraid that again she would be mocked by the goddess (Freya). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fear of being betrayed by the girl (Syr) again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the cruel truth was still there, Anya would never be able to stand up again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya desperately pressed her mouth, gagged the whimper that almost came out, and managed to suppress the lungs that almost hiccuped, and stood in front of the coffin (bed). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as she was unable to ask the truth  at all and could only stand trembling in place, the </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Sorry ...... Anya." </p>

<p class="calibre1">"----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She heard the words fall from the girl's lips and stopped time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is  it  true  that  you  meow  that  Anya  was  kidnapped  by  [Ferocious  Wolf]  meow, Rosie! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh-huh! Mae said she saw it ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p256"></a>"What the hell! At a time like this!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The corridor outside became a little noisy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were Chloe, Runoa, and the tavern staff who had come after Anya. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they came to the big room, Chloe and the girls were just about to make a sound, but when they saw this scene, they were also completely silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry ...... Chloe ...... sorry ...... Runoa." </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  also  heard  these  words  in  the  sacred  and  white  space  where  lies  are  not allowed to exist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry ...... Ryu." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eyes wide open, holding their breath, carrying the weight of the elfs who were not present together, shaking the heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry ...... Mia." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia, who had just arrived with Loki, also had her eyes widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ Hee, er ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya's eyes were no longer obeying her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A stream of tears flowed down and her tongue could not be properly controlled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come on ...... stop me ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, it was as if she was sharing this emotion with her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears also seeped from the girl's (Syr's) eyes. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"...... help me ......" </p>

<p class="calibre1">Anya's teardrop fell and was caught by the girl's cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya's trembling hand gently rested on her cheek and wiped away the tears that had mixed with the two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bert did not stop her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loki knew the matter would be passed on to the goddess, but did not stop it either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Being watched by the Chloe girls who could not make a sound, Anya slowly turned her body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She turned her back to the girl (Syr), took a step, lowered her head, and stopped in front of Mia and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chloe, Runoa ...... everyone ...... and, mom." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several drops of liquid fell to the feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The transparent liquid bounced and glistened on the marble floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Meow  ......  very  frightened,  brother  lord  meow  .......  Freya-sama,  even  more frightening meow ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice kept trembling. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p257"></a>The whimpering of the cat never dried up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa  with  tears  in  her  eyes,  Chloe  with  bangs  to  shield  her  eyes,  Mia  looked earnestly, when Anya raised her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But ...... Syr she said ...... save her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears kept falling from both eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  her  face  was  a  mess  from  crying,  the  cat,  who  had  been  shed  once, purred out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Meow  is  a  stupid  meow.  What's  true  and  what's  a  lie  ......  I  don't  understand anything! Even so!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning the purr wet with grief into determination, it shouted out. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"I still want to save my familia! </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the hall where lies were not allowed to exist, the  wish that was all there was resounded all around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa, Chloe, and the other clerks didn't say a word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Words were no longer needed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Well, what should we do? Mia?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the gods initiated the inquiry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dwarf stared at Anya's tears, then slammed his eyes shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if propelled by the girl's (Anya's) determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems to go to ask the girl (Syr) about her wish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She quietly clenched her fist, and then, opened her eyes with force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--Gone." </p>







<p class="calibre1">So time went back to the present. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Can you hear me, Syr? It doesn't matter if you can't hear me. Whether you hear me or not, I'll shout out!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya held the lance in her right hand, pressed her left hand to her chest, and shook her own throat towards 『The House of God』. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p258"></a>"I'm going to save you now meow! Even if Freya-sama says not to come, absolutely go!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pupil who had shaken off the tears had made up her mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat that had cut off the confusion let out a cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After all, the meows have heard the truth (words) of Syr!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the tip of the golden spear was pointed at the [Inferno Gold Four Warriors] </p>
<p class="calibre1">who were in the way, at the Tough Warriors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Knock these all~ down! Win the victory! Then go and stop Syr Meow!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The warriors' answer to this was also long predetermined. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「「「「 you don't want to --------- -」」」」 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both the four brothers of the prum and the few remaining strong warriors roared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strongest army came flying with weapons, Runoa rattled her fists, Chloe licked her lips, and Anya danced her lance like a whirlwind above her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Mistress of Abundance" broke out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Obstructed meow --------- -------!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two sides collided with each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The warrior and the abundance clashed fiercely as if they were beginning the last battle to usher in the end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each side was a symbol of the Goddess of the Goddess, and they were fighting to the death against each other around "She" who was only one pillar (one person). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The golden spear swept the enemy away. Only now the fist of the broken enemy shattered the armor. The treacherous poisoned blade (dagger) made the warrior spit blood from his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ania and the girls endured the quadruplets' onslaught and roared out their will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Syr, wait for us meow ------!" </p>

<p class="calibre1">--thud!!! A thud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess's slender arm swung down and smacked violently into the armrest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... How far will you go before you stop?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The throne of stone easily cut through her jewel-like skin, oozing blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Freya did not care, willow brows tightly wrinkled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the first time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time, the Queen (Freya) was so angry that she smashed something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  fierce  emotion  that  the  goddess  showed  made  the  earth  tremble,  the  sky tremble, and there was no more sound in the 'House of God'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amidst the dumbfounded eyes of the guards, Freya burned with "anger". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How far do you want to get in my way before you're satisfied! --Girl (Syr)! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p259"></a>Is this a rebuke to the girl (Horn) who had called herself "Syr"? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or was it a curse to the 『other self』 that should have been buried? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't ask for help. What Anya and the girls heard was the result of mixing the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"dream" with the feelings of the girl (Horn). It's so wrong to save something. The goddess asserted so. So asserted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There can be no such thing, the goddess will never admit it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The emotions of losing control and boundaries were too much for Freya to bear, and she radiated extreme anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Horn, Hedin, and you ......! What the hell is going on! Why do you all want the girl (Syr) so much!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lightning temporarily stopped and was replaced by the roar of Anya and the girls, their voices coming from outside the temple like an echo in a valley. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was what Freya was worried about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This divine will that ordered the swift and total destruction of the allied forces of the faction warlords was exploited by the inverted warlord (Hedin), but the divine will itself was quite correct. This countermeasure was to deal with the worst situation today - a third party  force called  "Mistress of Plenty" (Ghost  Brand)  entered the war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was all because the girl (Horn), no, the girl (Syr) had lied to Freya. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, Freya thought that the "apology to Anya and the girls" that kept ringing in her head was the content of a "dream" because she shared her five senses. She thought that the girl who was still asleep (Syr) was half-asleep and murmuring the rest of her dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that was not the case. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a message sent to Anya and the girls who visited the girl (Syr). </p>
<p class="calibre1">No need to guess, this must be the Joker's (Loki) idea. Among the gods, she was the only one who had accurately grasped the relationship between the goddess (Freya) and the girl (Syr). That pleasure offender in order to revenge and planned all this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And now, as Freya had feared, the battle had stepped into unpromising territory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was already coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya and the girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As well as, that one『Mistress』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Mia!" </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Bell!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p260"></a>At  the  same  time  that  Anya  and  the  girls  appeared  on  the  battlefield,  Ryu  also arrived at the amphitheater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miss Ryu ............ ............?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're really here, [Blast]." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenager who was kneeling on the ground and had turned into a bright red lump, and the pig man who was standing there leisurely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the overly contrasting two, Ryu lifted her eyebrows and immediately turned into a gust of wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She picked up Bell in front of Ottar, who had no intention of stopping, and moved to a slightly farther place after treatment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Right ...... not, up ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No need to talk. Please don't move." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You ...... are coming, ah ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course. How about I'm sorry I'm a little late." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was only then that you were put in such a desperate situation. She hugged Bell's shoulders, feeling deeply regretful and very sad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  had  been  unleashing  healing  magic  (Noah's  Cure),  but  Bell's  body  hadn't completely returned at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if having fought an artillery battle in the deserted theater, there were many test tubes  and  containers  (bottles)  that  had  fallen  to  pieces  scattered  about.  The recovery medicine, and even the cure-all made by Naza were all used up, yet they were still seriously injured. Brow furrowed, Ryu pressed the light of reply on Bell while looking ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Fierce One] Ottar. As an opponent, it was too powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Ryu, who had reached Lv. 6, couldn't imagine herself winning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu  stared  back  at  the  『strongest』  that  made  her  heart  tremble.  And  at  that moment. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Excuse me." </p>

<p class="calibre1">With the sound of a giant's footsteps shaking the earth - the same illusion - a dwarf appeared here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......! Mia's mother!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mia ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu  was  surprised  to  see  the  second  intruder,  while  Ottar  merely  narrowed  his eyes slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia still looked the same as usual. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p261"></a>Not  only  defensive  gear,  not  even  wearing  a  battle  suit,  wearing  a  plain  white apron, the usual shopkeeper dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only difference is the shovel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was large enough to look like an axe at first glance, 'steel weapon (shovel)'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She easily held it in one hand and held it over her shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia Grande just picked up a weapon (shovel) and came to the long-lost battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're not surprised, boar boy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I thought before that you would come too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing her call Lv. 7 as 'boar boy', Ryu and Bell felt incredulous, while the pigman said lightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But ...... didn't expect you to choose this side instead of going to Freya-sama's." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What silly things to say. I want to go over there, you will not be the same to rush over?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia's statement is very correct. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If someone were to approach the goddess, Ottar would stop 『baptism』 of Bell and stand in front of its person. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fierce one (here) was the 'final barrier' that Bell and the faction allies, as well as Ryu and Mia and their 'Mistress of Abundance' had to break through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ryu! Get back to the boy and come help! Get rid of this boar as soon as possible! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Don't you have something to say to Syr too!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And go slap that stupid girl for me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing  Mia's  loud  voice,  something  that  was  neither  weariness  nor  awareness but something very hot burned inside Ryu's heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kid!!! And don't you keep lying there! Have you forgotten what I said!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The one who can still stand on two legs until the end is the first! </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so did Bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenager sitting on the ground with the elf holding him had his eyes wide open and his chest burning deep in his chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... good, of ......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing Bell holding Ryu's hand on one knee and standing up again, Mia showed a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come on, Mia." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The huge black great sword was swung up with a loud sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p262"></a>Unlike when Bell confronted him, this time Ottar took a "stance" and entered into a state of battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't act like you're something, okay? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  dwarf  stepped  on  the  stone  slab  and  transformed  into  a  fierce  cannonball, hitting at the pigman. </p>






<p class="calibre1">The  unexpected  participation  of  [Little  Giant]  in  the  battle  turned  Orario  into  a frenzied servant for the first time in I don't know how many times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crowd's reaction was polarized. The relatively young adventurers and people who  have  only  recently  moved  to  Orario  are  very  confused,  while  many  people who know her true face are letting out a cheer like a sad cry. The gods who made the god tower shake, and the people who knew about the early stage of the "dark period" of Orario and those who did not, their support was different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there was also a common part among them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is, the dwarves who are still having back and forth with the [Fierce] today are incredibly  strong,  and  the  cat  people  who  arrived  as  reinforcements  are  also shockingly strong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, it's no longer known. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Where exactly the victory will go is now unpredictable, and the adventurers and the people are abuzz with discussion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  adventurers  at  the  tavern  who  were  staring  at  『Mirror』  were  breathing heavily and cursing 『Fuck them! Most of the people who were looking up at the Mirror  on  the  main  road  subconsciously  put  their  hands  together  and  started praying. Among the gods, the head of the bureau showed up again to reopen the underground gambling game, and was banned by the "resonators" of the gods of beauty, who could not take their eyes off the "mirror" for a moment now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  voices  that  were  too  excited  and  went  beyond  the  scope  of  support  were soaring and dominating the entire Labyrinth City. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shakti, Shakti-san! Is it okay, like this? </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  same  time,  there  were  some  people  who  couldn't  get  caught  up  in  the excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the [Ganesha Familia]. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p263"></a>The gendarmes who had taken up positions around the huge depression lake to monitor the remains of the city were in a state of confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The adventurers who had just withdrawn as much as possible from being ravaged by  the  [Freya  Familia]  and  were  out  afterwards  were  welcomed  with  this </p>
<p class="calibre1">『reinforcement commotion』. Defensively, the Ryu that felt high from the sky was really considered force majeure, but what made them feel humiliated was that a corner of the Puddle Lake encircling net was broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only bridge that separated the east from the west side of the island and was located directly south of it was broken by the "Mistress of Fortunes" group. The city gendarmerie was completely in vain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, with the [Little Giant] in front of them, even the [Ganesha Familia] could not be dispersed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The [Little Giant] and [Chariot Half Wheel] are after all God Freya's dependents, so turn a blind eye, but ...... others, all are not the dependents of the Union side, right? This is not against the rules, chief! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside the island, the front of the bridge, Lv. 5 of the first level adventurers are now still both eyes rolled, fell to the ground, staggering to stand up as the youth group member Modaka pointed to the island. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shakti,  who  was  previously  watching  from  other  locations  and  had  just  arrived, showed an extremely difficult expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's all the noise, Morthaga! Now we can finally make Freya's gang look good! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Be a little more accommodating!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's remain judges for a moment, Ilta-sama! And, my name is Modaka!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The female warrior Ilta argued with Modaka, while Shakti recalled the rules of this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  eligibility  to  participate『is  limited  to  the  dependents  of  the  gods  in  the island』. According to that, it was a clear violation of the rules for the Blight(Ryu) to participate in the battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many members of the group probably couldn't forgive [Freya's Familia] like Ilta, so they  planned  to  turn  a  blind  eye  to  it.  However,  Shakti  and  the  girls  were gendarmes and guardians of order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  personally  wanted  to  support  the  Righteous  Familia  (Ryu)  who  had  fought together during the Dark Period, but she had to fulfill her obligations as a [Kanesha Familia]. Even if it leads to people calling her stubborn-minded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Mendaccia was right, the participation of the Blast (Ryu) and the girls in the battle was not in accordance with the rules set by the Divine Council. The families </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p264"></a>participating in the battle must have the main god on the island, no exceptions. In view of their violation, a penalty is imposed on the faction valve alliance-" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understanding that the punishment in this situation would directly lead to the defeat of the Faction Valve United Army, Shakti, whose face was crooked, was ready to make a strict judgment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then, as long as the main gods (parents) of the dependents (children) are on the island, it's fine. Is that right, Shakti?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment before she did so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The beautiful 『Voice of the Goddess』 rang out from behind Shakti and the girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「--! You are--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shakti turned her body around violently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  the  voice  she  had  heard  before  could  make  her  think,  "Could  it  be",  the goddess burst into view, causing her to reflexively shout out her name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--Astraea-sama!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  long  walnut-colored  hair  that  flowed  down  her  back,  the  pure  white  dress without a trace of filth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes were clearer than Ryu's empty pupils, and there was a deep blue like the sea of stars in them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  the  『Goddess  of  Justice』-Astraea,  who  was  impossible  to  mistake, Shakti froze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why are you here ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ryu got the answer and came to me. Then, I'll come to be the power of that child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's all, oh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess of justice who was pleaded by the familia member (Ryu) who was determined to take revenge, and who left Orario five years ago, still has the light of incorruptibility in her pupils and smiles as if she had met an old acquaintance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind Astraea, there are several young girls who should be new dependents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among them, there was one more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you for leading the way, Asfi. Thanks to you, I barely made it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're welcome, Astraea-sama. I was just keeping my promise with Leon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's Asfi with her aqua hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was the one who had been watching the war games at the Tower of Babel with Hermes and picked them up. Ryu and Astraea, who were going to return to Orario from the distant Sword Smithing City Solingen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything was discussed in advance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the detailed format and schedule of the war games were set, a message was sent to the Sword System City, and if Ryu and the girls did not arrive in time - if </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p265"></a>one of the paired magic props given to Ryu before leaving the city began to glow and send a 'signal' - Asfi would personally Go to meet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this point, the goddess and the others had arrived at a place within sight of the Labyrinth City, and she, who was able to fly with her 『Flying Boots』, first brought Ryu to the sky above the 『Orza City Ruins』, and then dropped it. Immediately after  that,  she  returned  and  guided  the  newborn  [Astraea's  familia]  to  this  huge depression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're here too, Shakti. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was worried about what would happen after the Chloe girls never came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lord Demeter ...... and the god Njord ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to Astraea and the girls, the goddess and the male god also appeared here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Demeter, who is responsible for the first industry of O'Leary, and Njord, who runs the fishing industry in the port town of Melian. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All the children of the 'Mistress of Abundance' have been converted." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Those guys are already our dependents. Then it's okay for us to participate in the battle in terms of the rules, right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the words of the two pillar gods, Shakti was taken aback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Being  asked  by  Runoa  and  Chloe  to  bow  their  heads,  Demeter  and  the  girls completed their 『Mistress of Abundance』 proselytization the day before the war games. As long as they stepped onto the island, they would not break any rules. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ryu told me what happened. I never dreamed that Freya and the boy would turn out to be that kind of relationship. But ...... Ryu even crossed Freya's divine will and said to me that she wanted to 『fight』. Said that after losing Alizé and the girls, she should have died herself saved by 『she』, and this time she will go to </p>
<p class="calibre1">『she』 to ask for clarification ......』 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Astraea looked into the distance and looked very emotional. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  also  like  a  parent  who  watches  over  the  growth  of  a  child,  she  made  her decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The child's "justice" now is "to stop the confidant. Then, in order for that child to fly smoothly, I also want to light up the starlight and illuminate her path. ...... From now on, we will join the faction warlord alliance." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lord Astraea ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You can cross this bridge, right? Shakti?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Swaying her walnut hair, Astraea smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shakti also looked at the goddess, and then looked at her dependents. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p266"></a>Looking  at  the  [Familia]  emblem  on  their  bodies  -  the  sword  and  feather symbolizing the balance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shakti and the girls had used it as a role model, and now they had also inherited the 'right' badge of its will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under the gaze of the gods and the nervous members of the group, Shakti closed her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It didn't take long for her to step back from the gods and make way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please go through. Everyone has the right to this bridge." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--Thank you, Shakti." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This decision left Modaka dumbfounded and made the Ilta girls cheer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without  waiting  for  the  leader's  order,  the  members  of  the  group  prepared</p>
<p class="calibre1">『flowers』and  handed  them  to  the  gods.  Under  the  watchful  eyes  of  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Ganesha Familia], who had lined up to make way, and Asfi and Shakti, who had stayed behind, the [Astraea Familia], Demeter, and Njord entered the 'Orza City Ruins'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm a little late in greeting, it's been a long time, Astraea. How are you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm fine, Demeter. You and Njord look healthy too, that's great. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd love to get together and catch up, but ...... isn't the time for that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  three  gods  who  had  come  and  gone  before  the  "Dark  Period"  laughed together, but stopped after crossing the bridge and coming to the south side of the ruins. Just after entering the island, the sound of battle that had been ringing out became more intense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the sound of a deadly fight that no one who was not an Orario adventurer could ever enter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry I had to ask you to accompany me from Sword City to here, Cecil, and everyone else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's okay! We are Astraea-sama's Familia, and we will protect you! --Besides, this is a big deal for our senpai! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five years ago, the girls who had left Orario to become dependents smiled happily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking at these young girls, who were considered Ryu's juniors, Astraea couldn't help but smile, and then looked ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looked to the west side of the ruins where the cries of struggle still resounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Although we have the right to watch, we are not qualified to fight. So, just watch from afar here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Watching the final end of the Ryu girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After saying that, the goddess narrowed her blue eyes. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p267"></a>"I forgot to add to the rules that [dependents] from outside the city are forbidden to participate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Freya-sama, I'm sorry aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the gods who looked at Astraea and the girls, the male gods on Freya's side spilled their remorseful sorrowful cries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  that  [Freya's  familia]  as  their  opponent,  it  was  unlikely  that  there  would  be reinforcements - if there were, it would be even more lively - and it was too late for the "Resonators" who were thinking that way to regret. Since there was a loophole in the set rules, as omniscient and omnipotent gods, they could not rebuke either Astraea's participation in the battle or Shakti's judgment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shouts of Abhinu calling kept ringing out, and in the thirtieth floor of such a divine tower, a column of goddesses leisurely traversed through it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is finally a showdown." </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a 'heavy' sound like an old man, Loki sat down on the empty seat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind him was Bert, who had been forcibly brought here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Watching  the  battle  with  these  noisy  gods,  what  a  joke  ......"  he  complained offhandedly, but the goddess paid no attention, she crossed her legs and looked up at the huge 'mirror' above her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beside her, another god also sat down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「Yo, clown (troublemaker). What kind of magic did you use to send Mia there? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You have the nerve to say that about us, you little white boy. Didn't you use all your tricks to put Astraea in there too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loki snickered and said to Hermes who had one hand raised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These two pillars of gods were actually 『supporters behind the scenes』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the one hand, they understood that the victory of the faction valve alliance army was  desperate,  but  they  had  been  formulating  countermeasures  for  their  own reasons in order to protect the teenager (Bell), or because they saw that the queen (Freya) was not happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to them, the coalition of factions also received support from those who could not fight, such as Finn, and now finally came to this "watershed". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you have anything else hidden? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No. After this, it's a real battle without tricks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bullets were empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether they will win, lose, or end up in a different way after this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It all depends on the adventurers on the battlefield, and the gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To support that fried potato ball Opie, we are really reluctant, but ...... is still much better than the current Freya. It's so much better. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p268"></a>So, she continued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The vermillion haired goddess stared at the scene in front of the 'mirror'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We've prepared you here ...... to win, little one." </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Uh oh oh oh oh oh ......! I don't know how good I've become ......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia is not even aware that Loki is glaring at her, whispering out feelings that are no different from the symbol of incompetence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just within the range of sight, there was lightning and abundance (meow) and the like raging, and the atmosphere of a defeated battle that was bound to come was swept away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In order not to waste the sacrifice of Hephaestus and the girls, she scurried around for  a  while.  This  self-proclaimed  hide-and-seek  master  managed  to  escape  the clutches  of  her  pursuers  (Allen  and  others).  To  be  precise,  it  was  the  God  of Forging (Hephaestus) and the God of War (Ares) who bought enough time for her to escape their sentient net. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miach gave me the deodorant bomb (prop) ......! Got rid of the orcs' tracking!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then there is the prop that Miach and Naza attuned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As soon as she found out that many of the enemy troops were orcs who were used to relying on『sense of smell』, Hestia used it from head to toe. Choosing to use it  when  the  gods  were  out  in  droves  after  separating  from  the  forged  gods  also played a big role. The orcs chasing the young goddess (Hestia) were confused by the sudden disappearance of the scent and had no choice but to switch to other targets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young goddess, who didn't notice her bountiful bosom peeking out from the shadows of the ruins, was peeking around - it seems that the "search for the gods" </p>
<p class="calibre1">that was launched earlier is almost over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... enemy is gradually returning to the west side ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the depths of the legacy structure, violent sand and dust and the sound of swift galloping not like horse hooves danced in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with the crisis of the main camp - the main god (Freya), Allen and the others terminated the hunt for the gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the strong warriors crossing the urban ruins with swift momentum from east to west, Hestia first rubbed her chest with relief. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Be  that  as  it  may,  what  should  we  do  after  that  ......?  Should  we  hide  here,  or move ....... It feels like reinforcements are coming from the south, it would be safer to go that way ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p269"></a>Although having knowledge, but completely unable to feel the battlefield Hestia is very troubled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  wanting  to  ask  Lily's  opinion,  she  is  afraid  that  now  with  two  eyes bloodshot desperately commanding, the goddess see will be scared to roll up the white eyes. If the eye crystal is activated, it is estimated that the shouts of the prum will resound all around and be discovered by the enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were few gods left except for herself (me), and just when she was clutching her head with this situation of having no one to rely on </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hestia!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look! --Ah, Miach! Oh, you're okay!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice that came from her made her body go limp, and when she saw that it was the figure of her divine friend coming with her long dark blue hair, she let out a voice of joy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ahhh, it looks like you are too! Saved by Naza's deodorant bomb, huh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Hestia was able to escape with the deodorant bomb, it was natural that Miach, who also possessed the deodorant bomb, could also use it to get around skillfully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  the  two  gods  confirmed  that  the  'flower'  stuck  in  each  other's  chests  was intact, they praised each other for their smooth escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What should we do after this, Miach? Freya's children seem to have returned to the west side, so we just need to find a place that isn't west to hide secretly-" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The west side!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's go west, Hestia!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh eh eh eh!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia was stunned to see Miach support the option that had been ruled out without saying a word, and at that moment </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This battle, 'hide-and-seek' is no longer meaningful! If Naza or Bell fall, then the remaining gods (us) will only become prey! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I saw the battlefield from the high platform! The battle on the west side is a duel between  the  two  camps  with  all  their  forces!  We  have  to  win  here!  And  then,  if there's anything the incompetent gods (we) can do, it's--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--update [ability value]?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia understood Miach's divine intent and spoke his subsequent words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aim for the [experience value] gained in this war game and raise the ability value of the dependents (Bell-kun) as much as possible. Is that what you mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That is correct. Of course, we can never be out of the game ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p270"></a>If the Lord God is out, the dependents will also lose the right to continue fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This also comes with the risk of『Flower』being taken away, Miach's face tensed up floor, however </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's okay, let's go. We can't be the only ones still relaxing in the safety zone! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hestia ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's help Bell and Naza and the others! Let's be the goddess of victory, Miach!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ahhh! Even though I'm a male god!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both gods smiled, said their decisions, and ran. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Towards the main battlefield on the west side where the Familias had gathered. </p>





<p class="calibre1">Each  blow  of  the  weapon  that  was  heavy  and  powerful  to  the  limit  would  be  a thunderous melody even beyond if it was connected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the first time that the adventurers knew about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, wow ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black great sword and the steel shovel kept producing clashes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Listening to the booming sound of destruction, the half-little human Van, who was lying on his back in the audience, was blue in the face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he woke up after fainting, he found a dumbfounding battle unfolding in front of him. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Look! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ones who couldn't say anything were Bell and Ryu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next to them, who could only turn into stone statues, Mia made another move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She raised her weapon high and slashed it down, and Ottar's black sword caught it from the front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He himself, who was defending, was not hurt, but the stage was unbearable. The amphitheater sank into the stone slab as the legs,  which were as thick  as logs, shattered. Mia flicked away the black sword that was slashing horizontally, and the giant body of the dwarf hit the ground while breaking the marble pillars that rolled to the ground. The flying sand and dust bred a moment of silence, and the next instant she lunged at Ottar again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Destruction and shattering fierce collision. The surrounding area was filled with a violent impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p271"></a>The  extremely  intense  battle  destroyed  the  surrounding  area  before  it  could destroy the opponent in front of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gee!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unable to break the defense of the black sword, Mia, as if to vent her anger, did not choose the shovel, but made her rigid fist roar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hand holding the weapon in the opposite hand made an uppercut. Ottar also did not dare to carelessly defend with one hand and flew backwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  moment's  pause  came,  and  the  amphitheater,  which  already  looked  half-destroyed, sighed reassuringly as one of the pillars at the edge fell away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's been a while, you've gotten better." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah? ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the words of Mia, who had left the faction valve for a long time, Ottar did not feel any emotion and put his great sword against his shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Takeshi's face oozed with approval of the result that was taken for granted, and the 『disappointment』 that was induced with it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mia, it is you who has become weak." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're not moving forward, and I'm moving forward. That's all it should be. But even so ...... now it's me on top and you on the bottom." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lv. 7 vs. Lv. 6. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if you just look at the mere numbers, you can clearly see that Ottar is at a higher level. On the contrary, Mia who ignored the absolute rank (level) gap and fought to win was more counterintuitive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, even without looking at that, Orta would still say that she 『had become weaker』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having wished  that  she was  a stronger  existence than himself, his face seeped with the fondness he had for the once high walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Before you left the "Battle Wilderness", I didn't win you once. I wanted to win you once ...... but it doesn't matter anymore. I'm not stuck with it anymore." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He said a lot in a rare way, shedding his constraint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Mia's reaction was very simple and easy to understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't get carried away, you boar boy ahhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the second act, the battle began again, and once again the theater let out a sad cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  undoubtedly  a  battle  between  two  of  the  uppermost  monsters  in  King's Landing, and it made Bell and Ryu shudder even as they watched and breathed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p272"></a>"Miss Mia, I knew she should be very powerful ............ but I didn't expect it to be so strong ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But even so ...... [Fierce One]'s suppression is still too powerful! </p>
<p class="calibre1">While marveling at the strength of the mistress, Bell and the others also sensed where the battle was headed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar's『defense』could  not  be  broken.  Unable  to  chisel  out  a  hole  above  that overwhelming 『technique and strategy』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  don't  know  whether  he  would  turn  defense  into  offense  first,  or  Mia  would  be exhausted first. In any case, as long as he couldn't overcome the absolute defense, he couldn't shake the undefeatable [Fierce]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fledglings who had obtained the qualification of calling themselves first level adventurers had the insight to see through that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miss Ryu, let's go too! You can move already!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not yet. I can't go yet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu,  who  was  on  both  knees,  held  down  Bell,  who  stood  up  on  one  knee  and wanted to rush out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her left hand, which was wrapped around her right shoulder, and her right hand, which was wrapped around her left waist, lit up with a green light like the sunlight between the trees, and were now healing her injured body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you don't recover completely, it will be over if you get touched. It's just dragging Mia's mother down." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hold on, Bell. It'll be fine right away." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu's recovery magic can even plug wounds while restoring strength, but it doesn't work immediately like recovery pills or elixirs. The side effect of the good effect is the  disadvantage  of  taking  time  to  completely  recover.  In  addition,  the  damage given  by  Lv.  7  is  too  severe,  which  also  slows  down  the  speed  of  complete recovery. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell could not resist. He couldn't possibly resist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  the  Ryu  girls  came,  it  was  he  himself  who  had  endured  this  absolute strength gap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He watched, as if praying, the figure of Mia who collided with that terrifying 『the strongest』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Bell. Before the battle, there is something I want to ask you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As he watched the battle in fascination, Ryu whispered in his ear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was then that Bell noticed the distance between the two. Just now he was no different from a dead man, so he didn't have this mind, but in fact, the two bodies </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p273"></a>were pressing together without any gap. 'Deep' what happened had a moment to come  to  mind,  but  in  the  face  of  this  fierce  battle,  neither  Bell  nor  Ryu  had  the leisure to feel shame. The feeling has also been numb. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like a knight guarding a wounded princess, and like pressing a rabbit that might rush out at any moment, Ryu pressed her body close to Mia and asked in a voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you going to do to Syr?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... do, what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm going to bring her back and slap her around." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yeah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Ryu's most murderous words to date, Bell forgot even the status quo and felt unusually scared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So far, Ryu couldn't even imagine that she would want to do such a thing to her benefactor (Syr). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu would never forgive the goddess who was next to no one - forgive 『her』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anya and the girls should think the same way. So, I must drag her to us. ...... and then ask what we are really considered to be to her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What about you? What do ...... you want to do to Syr after this battle?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia, the gods, and the adventurers fought to win this war game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To guard Bell, or to avenge Freya and participate in the war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, Bell and Ryu are different. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only person they were looking at was "She" who was waiting in front of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So  before  asking  the  true  intention  of  『She』,  Ryu  wanted  to  know  the  inner thoughts of Bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Miss Horn ...... Syr herself had said so to me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell first took a soft breath, and then quietly spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She said she didn't want to go crazy over 'love'...... said to save her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, I'm going to save her. And then, surely ...... will hurt her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like uncovering his own wounds, he clenched his teeth and uttered the answer he had decided long ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After all, it is all because of me that that person has gone to a desperate situation." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was obvious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She was the beginning of everything, and Bell was the opportunity for everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether it was the girl (Syr), the goddess (Freya), or the boy (Bell). </p>
<p class="calibre1">All of them were seriously injured because of their own 'selfishness', and there was no place in their body where blood was not flowing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p274"></a>"Because of my fault, that person is still in pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If she hadn't been in pain because of Bell, Bell wouldn't have held on to this selfish desire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  the  girl  (Syr)  had  liked  someone  else,  or  hated  herself,  Bell  would  have  felt embarrassed and then let go a little and not done anything too out of the ordinary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let's (let's) be friends again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two failed to say so, and then parted, because the goddess (Freya) was very stubborn, because Bell had stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So,  I  will  be  hurt  with  her  ............  until  that  person  is  willing  to  show  the  same smile as before, and I will always help her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell is not wrong. There can be no mistake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was taught by Welf, and after suffering, he finally chose to long for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What was at fault was the goddess (Freya) who did such a thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Bell was very gentle and wanted to carry『her』s sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Bell. You are so cruel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">However Ryu reproached him, as if this tenderness of the teenager was the very thing that should be condemned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You are really an excessive 『hypocrite』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of his eyes, under the distance where the lips would touch each other if he was slightly careless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The empty-colored pupils glared sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell first lowered his eyes like a sinner - and then laughed out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I am the 'hypocrite'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looked back with a bruised smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, this 『hypocrisy (selfishness)』 is the only thing I won't give up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the divine room of that pale blue moonlit night where the two had spoken many words, he had come to an answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dice that had been cast had long since shattered, and the two could only let their selfish desires collide with each other, hurting each other and shedding blood and teardrops. Bell could no longer turn back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even if it will hurt that person again ...... I have to stop her." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crimson and empty-colored pupils gazed at each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  sight  intertwined,  each  other's  thoughts  collided  with  each  other  and  mixed into one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu quietly smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p275"></a>"...... response is over. Let's go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The green light disappeared, and Bell's wound was completely healed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu stood up first, and Bell held her hand, and also tugged up the still shaky body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two stood in a line and looked towards the front of the violent conflict between the pigmen and the dwarves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After going there, the rest was just non-stop fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Until the winner was decided, until they reached "her", the only thing they could do was to fight to the death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell. There's something I want to tell you first." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I like you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay. ........................ eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The body of Bell, who was about to take a step forward, followed the momentum and was about to fall to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenager managed to keep his footing and faltered as he looked back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I like you ...... is to a male." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu stood there, blossoming like a young girl with a brilliant smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her face was not tinged with red, just a clean white and very peaceful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the  contrary,  Bell,  who  discovered  that  it  was  neither  a  hallucination  nor  a misunderstanding, slowly reddened her face and showed a silly expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That would be fair. So that I can slap Syr's face." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally she narrowed her eyes slightly like a child who likes to play pranks and ran out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Left in the same place as a soldier who was holding a bomb before the final battle, he  froze,  shaken  and  confused,  but  he  immediately  shook  his  head  again  with force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--Only now, focus on the battle at hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">-- Only now, to think only about that man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He convinced himself of this and changed his mind, showing the expression of an adventurer facing a duel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He became a "hypocrite" who carried out "hypocrisy (selfishness)". </p>
<p class="calibre1">His body sank and he ran, chasing after Ryu's back in front of him and throwing himself into the fierce battle. </p>




<p class="calibre1"><a id="p276"></a>From the direction of the amphitheater, which was far away, a booming sound that was thought to be a distant thunder rose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  the  tough  warriors  were  not  timid  and  added  a  magnificent accompaniment to the increasingly intense performance in the theater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's chronic--! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He birthed the blast drive that even the wind must fear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On this battlefield, truly faster than anyone running Allen was filled with rage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  adventurers  who  were  constantly  dying  and  threatening  the  goddess,  the maggots who were revolting, and the  『Sister』 who appeared leisurely on this battlefield made him burn with a fire that was close to hatred and turned it into fuel for his swift advance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hurry up, hurry up! Hold on tight!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't let Allen-sama leave you behind! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking at Allen's distant back, the tough orc warriors desperately tried to keep up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fast-footed elite was running towards the 'main battlefield' where Alfrigg and the 'Mistress of the Bounty' were clashing with each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chloe, Runoa! Brother-sama is coming meow!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya was the first to sense the arrival of this warband led by 『Chariot』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her ears perked up like a stray cat, and she stared at the east. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stop talking nonsense and hurry up - 'Prepare'! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yawn ah ah! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just these guys are enough to keep meows busy, meow! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kah!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa  roared,  swinging  an  iron  fist  that  shattered  the  dwarf's  sternum,  and  the sweaty Chloe made the elf spit blood with the poison on his dagger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aisha-sama! That's how you're going to attack with Runoa-sama and the others! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't have to tell you...! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Behind, behind...?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the attack from behind by the allied faction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  reuniting  with  all  the  reserves,  the  former  left  flank  (Aisha  and  the  girls) regrouped in the center of the eastern part of the "main battlefield". Anya and the girls, who had crossed the bridge to the island, came from the south and pinned the enemy troops led by the four Gulliver brothers in the middle. At this point, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Freya Familia] was exposed to attacks from both sides, so they were suffering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, Jidong girls, give this to your companions! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Huh? Is this ......『Earrings』? Chloe-sama, what kind of thing is this? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p277"></a>"The  magic  item  that  the  Justice  Faction  Valve  (Ryuyu)  had  the  Almighty  make earlier! I've brought all of them! We'll figure out what to do with them, so send them out! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm not sure I understand, but ...... is fine, Runoa-sama! </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, the last group of tough warriors standing on the 『main battlefield』, the upper level adventurers other than the cadres, all fell down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin's  shelling,  and  the  numerical  advantage  constituted  by  the  addition  of</p>
<p class="calibre1">『Mistress of Plenty』. These hunted down all the tough groups consisting of Lv. </p>
<p class="calibre1">3 and Lv. 4. In this way, the only one left was the [Inferno Gold Four Warriors]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">「「「「 Go to hell!!! 」」」」 </p>

<p class="calibre1">The quadruplet's attack annihilated four carmen at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing that their fellow colleagues were beaten down in one breath, Runoa and Chloe both had a million bitterness on their faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Couldn't  be  beaten.  Only  the  last  remaining  Alfrigg  of  these  people,  even  the shelling  of  the  elfs,  even  with  the  full  power  of  the  abundance  could  not  be captured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sand-colored helmet and armor stained with the blood of the enemy, and four weapons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Describing them as small evil spirits is mild, and each of them can be described as a storm that is compressed to the extreme. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The four brothers showed an incredible 『connection』 and cut down the number of abundant shopkeepers to the naked eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「Richa!? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The battle whore did the same. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Amazons who intended to meet the attack in panic were cut down together, and the battle force on the allied side was left with only Aisha, Mikoto and Naza except for the reserve - the escort of Haruhime in transparent state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now it's a paradoxical situation of forcing your opponent into a desperate situation while your own side is also in crisis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  only  remaining  force  is  the  [Inferno  Gold  Four  Warriors],  and  the  powerful artillery support is no longer effective, which is a great disadvantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  for  mutual  hostility,  Alfrigg  and  Hedin  are  still  very  clear  about  each  other's skills. The four brothers knew very well the nature of the annihilation magic (Karus Hild), so they used Runoa and Aisha as 'shields' and cut off the rays. In the end, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p278"></a>even Hedin's precision shot was extremely difficult to hit the first level adventurer from hundreds of M away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... is like that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Far away from the north side of Alfrigg's 『main battlefield』 where they were. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin narrowed his eyes and said in a low voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seemed that he seemed to have sensed that there was little effect, and stopped the previous shooting and changed it to 『harassment』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shooting the lightning bombs high into the air, they made a big parabola and fell towards Alfrigg and the others from overhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfrigg  and  the  others  certainly  wouldn't  be  hit  by  such  random  bombardment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These attacks will also not hit the Aisha women who were used as a 'shield', at the cost of the effect of the most explosive smoke and loud noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The commander (Lily) with a crooked face could only judge that he couldn't count on Hedin's shelling anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now, the absolute "hard power" called the first level adventurer was in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If there is no this 『golden light』, it must be quite bad meow ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Although I can't see anyone, I think it was that little whore who used to do it ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I feel like I'm going to be led by the power value if I'm not careful! </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  were  able  to  withstand  the  onslaught  of  the  furious  four  brothers  without being instantly knocked down, all because of the power of level ascension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haruhime acted under Lily's precise instructions, giving Aisha, Runoa and Chloe their golden light to reach a simulated Lv. 5. Looking only at the numbers, this is the same ability as Alfrigg and the others. The girls strictly adopted the tactic of disengaging with a single blow, never dealing with the opponent's "Combination" </p>
<p class="calibre1">head-on, and managed to bring the battle to a stalemate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this stalemate would never turn into an "antagonist". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  the  "Chariot"  had  already  crossed  the  center  of  the  island  and  was coming to the "main battlefield". </p>
<p class="calibre1">(If it rendezvoused with the [Goddess Chariot], it would be over ......!) Lily looked around at the scene in front of her and her heartbeat was very confused. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The place quite close to the grave where she was was engaged in a blazing attack and defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  Allen  and  his  men  joined  the  battle  at  this  point,  the  battle  line  would  easily collapse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily raised her head and sweat dripped down along her forehead as she saw the mass of people approaching along with the sand and dust. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p279"></a>(The [Inferno Gold Four Warriors] must be defeated immediately! Otherwise, if this continues, the chance of victory will slip away!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily blocked out all other information and kept a close eye on Alfrigg and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Staring at the quadruplets' fierce attacks, their movements, 『Connecting』 itself, not letting go of every detail. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Habits, weaknesses, breathing, whatever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together with the information provided by Finn, a thorough analysis of the [Inferno Gold Four Warriors] was conducted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  concentration  that  came  to  the  limit  made  Lily's  thinking  speed  faster  and faster, and finally reached the other side of the aura. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus, Lily came to the conclusion that </p>
<p class="calibre1">('Loophole' - doesn't exist!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the cruel reality itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Infinite Linkage". The four brothers who had such a good reputation did not have any gaps at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Four people make up for each other and never show any "loopholes". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The third male Berling killed the shopkeeper back, the eldest male Alfrigg bounced back Naza's snipe, the second male Duvaline and the fourth male Grer sent Aisha and Runoa's pincer attack flying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The phrase 'four together is enough to win against a first level adventurer' is by no means an exaggeration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(As long as those four are together, there is no 『loophole』!!!) Despair came to Lily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the time limit also visited her mercilessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Crush you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  "chariot"  came  to  a  distance  where  it  could  be  seen  clearly  with  a  hideous gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen  was  decisive  in  accelerating  further  at  that  moment,  to  scatter  the  faction alliance with Runoa and the others, and perhaps even Alfrigg and the others. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"[Grey sky, vanished homes, blackness, rain of ruins]--" </p>

<p class="calibre1">At that moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "song" sounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The song that was caught by his hearing caused Allen to stop thinking for a few moments. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p280"></a>"The headless pupil, the bronze statue of inquiry. But so, but so? You are a young cat, a lost wheel. I am the tears, the whimpering servant.]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sand clears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The figure that emerged was a cat man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lance is thrust into the stone floor, hands pressed to the chest, eyes closed, weaving the voice of an abandoned cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Looking for a home. I searched everywhere but no answer. I asked the black crow (bird of prey). I did not know if there was one. So I cried out. I sang alone on the back of my familia (you). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of the explosion gradually diminished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  now  it  had  been  weaving,  and  the  'chanting'  that  was  nearing  completion came clearly to the ears of the four brothers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfrigg and the others were struck by surprise, and the attack stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「Anya-sama, is chanting ......! Does it mean that ...... Hedin-sama's magic has become 『Disguise』! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily, who was the only one overlooking the battle from the grave, grasped the full picture of what was going on accurately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shooting the thunderbolt high up, merely raising the sand and dust and making a loud  explosion  sound,  Hedin's  『harassment』  covered  up  Anya  who  was concentrating on chanting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  covered  the  chanting  of  Allen,  Alfrigg,  and  the  former  member  of  the  group (Anya), which Hedin naturally knew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was also the "magic" that made the cat people and the prum feel anxious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no way to stop it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the cat (Anya) chanting like a holy woman, and seeing her posture that was different from her usual appearance, Lily couldn't help but be fascinated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Put on the earplugs...! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Disaster sound fool is coming! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh, eh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Runoa and Chloe changed their faces and put on their earplugs, causing confusion among the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Please don't leave me alone] - [Lost Kitten]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic name was announced here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p281"></a>"[Meow ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah]! </p>

<p class="calibre1">A fierce "strange sound wave" was released. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Of course, Lily, who didn't get the earplugs (magic item) from life, fell to the ground covering her ears as she suffered from the "phone-deaf disaster" that the black cat (Chloe) said. Definitely not what the saint's super noise destruction weapon makes her mind float away, while rolling around on the ground in pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen, who hastily plugged his ears, and the tough warriors who followed behind also heard the song. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfrigg, Duvalin, Berling, and Grer all fell victim to it helplessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Hestia and Miach were startled by the noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Super wide area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone was affected by the ripple, a rare range of effect so large. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not  to  mention  Hedin,  who  had  his  ears  firmly  blocked  with  his  index  fingers  to avoid being affected by the fallout, but even the crowd at the end of the 『mirror』 </p>
<p class="calibre1">felt their bodies go weak, and that's when the  『power』 of the magic began to appear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first to notice the change was Lily, who was barely able to hold up her upper body with trembling hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......? Strength, can't use it ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's not the same feeling of exhaustion. Nor is it the feeling of carrying a heavy load, it's almost as if your own body has thinned out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you look closely, you will find that your whole body is carrying a little glowing red magic light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, is this ............ 'abnormal magic'? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lilly found the answer with wide maroon eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does it mean weakened ability! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya's magic [Lost Kitten]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Lilly noticed, its effect was 『Abnormal Magic』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the opposite of Haruhime's level up, and would cause a significant drop in ability value, which could be called a symbol of diminishing empowerment (debuff). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ania of the extremely large tone deaf disaster, all the victims who hear her song - </p>
<p class="calibre1">within the range of the magic effect - regardless of the enemy and me, will appear </p>
<p class="calibre1">"low ability". </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p282"></a>Only the special magic props can block the song, cutting the magic effect of Lily raising her head violently. Right now on the battlefield, whether it was the strong warriors  of  the  orcs,  or  the  [Inferno  Gold  Four  Warriors],  even  the  [Goddess Chariot] was trapped by this red magic light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chronic, damn you!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling the [Lost Young Cat] that was still echoing in his tympanic membrane and tormenting him, Allen roared with extreme anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cough,  cough  ............  so,  brother-sama  you  guys,  it  becomes  super  weak meow ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the oversized『Abnormal Magic』that could only be activated once in battle-and had to be activated again after at least half a day-was activated, Anya rubbed her overused throat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  it  didn't  drop  the  level  by  one  stage,  among  the  countless  mitigation powers, [Lost Kitten] was one of the most powerful. It can cause a significant drop in ability value, in addition to hindering the effects of『skills』and『magic』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  latter  effect  was  much  trickier  than  the  former,  and  knowing  this,  his  own brother (Allen) glared at his sister (Anya) as if he had seen an enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The elder brother ...... Meow is very afraid of his elder brother meow. After being abandoned  also,  I  want  to  be  a  familia  member  again,  I  do  not  want  to  make Brother-sama angry ...... I have been very afraid." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Being looked at by these sharp eyes, Anya but did not flinch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After joining the [Freya Familia], she had been peering at her brother's face in order not to be abandoned, but now she was staring at him with a straight face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To be honest, now she also wanted to  become a familia with her elder brother again.  --But!  Meow  has  another  familia  member!  Ryu,  Chloe,  and  Runoa!  In addition  to  Mia's  mother  and  the  others,  there's  the  'only  familia  member'  who saved Meow! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya was so dumb that she didn't know why 『she』 had saved herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That rainy day, Allen, and the goddess (Freya) herself had abandoned herself, and the girl (Syr) saved herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The girl (Syr) saved her and gave her a home as the "Mistress of Plenty". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe it was just a whim of the  gods, as 'she' said. Maybe it was just the cruel amusement  of  the  gods  that  first  had  a  heart  for  the  bruised  Anya,  and  then intended to destroy Anya again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--Save me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Anya had already heard the girl's (Syr's) heartfelt words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Already knew what the girl (Syr) was suffering from as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p283"></a>"So, Meow is going to get Syr!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya was a fool. It was also the『abandoned cat』who was afraid of loneliness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She knows how lonely it is to be alone, that's why she wants her familia. Familia is the most important thing to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, if it's to help her familia - even if it's a familia member with blood (older brother) will fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"For this reason, if necessary, defeat the elder brother! Only now! I will become the enemy of my elder brother-sama!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「-You fool!!! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Anya's 'declaration of war', Allen let out a roar of utmost anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the abnormal magic, he ran forward to stab his own sister with his silver spear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya also set up the same golden spear and sped past, the distance between the enemy and me disappeared instantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first sibling quarrel between the two cats since they were born was kicked off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're going too!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ola  Ola,  Awakening  Meow!  Victims  of  the  Calamity  Sound  Cat  Poison  Players (Anya Solo)! </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Runoa and Chloe took off the earrings they had been wearing and took the opportunity to attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The original name of the earrings was『Silent Harp』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  a  magic  item  that  was  modified  from  the  earpiece  that  was  originally developed by the [Almighty] to block the song of the "songbird" or the "mermaid" - </p>
<p class="calibre1">a magic item that was enhanced by Asfi himself in the face of the powerful enemy that used "sound" to attack in the dark period. Once listening to a disaster sound cat  poisonous  play  (Anya  -  recital)  of  Lu  Noah  and  others  with  Ryu  has  (also including the relics of his companions) of this, the tavern staff went out to ask Asfi to mass produce it, a rather complicated origin of the thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「「「「 you bastards!!! 」」」」 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The four brothers, who were all on their feet, pounced on Runoa and others, who were not affected by the powerful reduction in benefits. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"This, this is ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With Anya's『Magic』as an opportunity, the battle situation changed completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the face of the attacks from the level-up reinforced Runoa girls and Aisha, the four Gulliver brothers, who had been in an overwhelming advantage, turned to the defensive for the first time. The orc tough warriors were unable to get close to the </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p284"></a>high-speed  battle  between  Allen  and  Anya,  so  they  scrambled  to  support  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Inferno Gold Four Warriors]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(And  these  tough  warriors  were  weakened  by  abnormal  magic!  The  number  of battle whores and tavern clerks were also few, but even if we don't count that ......!) The  situation  is  evenly  matched.  At  least  as  long  as  the  Lv.5  Anya  is  still suppressing Allen, the battle against the [Inferno Gold Four Warriors] has "extra time". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In  this  way,  if  we  can  find  a  way  to  solve  the  [Inferno  Gold  Four  Warriors]'s </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Linking』-! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily  looked  at  the  entire  battlefield  from  the  roof  of  the  tomb,  and  sent  all  her remaining strength to her brain to think. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not  a  second  should  be  wasted.  To  quickly  formulate  a  feasible  battle  with  the highest success rate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  commander  girl  who  had  been  making  sacrifices  for  her  companions  was putting her life on the line in these few seconds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aisha-sama, Mikoto-sama, and Naza-sama! Lili will now tell us about the battle! </p>
<p class="calibre1">She sent a communication to the "last main battle force" of the allied forces of the faction warlords who were preparing to reply with Naza's props. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no need to elaborate between people who had recognized each other's power, and the message she conveyed was very concise and very quick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「Sh......! Wait, wait a minute, Sir Lilly! Performing such a battle, you will ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">『So  far  Lilly  has  sacrificed  many  adventurers  and  gods-sama!  That's  why  I'm putting my life on the line too! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as Mikoto objected to what was being conveyed, Inuyasha, who was listening intently, spoke up and said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... is fine. Count me in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Naza-sama?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've run out of arrows for ......." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After this, there's no way to fight properly ...... so I'll be the 'bait' too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it is the rear support, the combat clothing and defense equipment is also full of wounds Naza showed a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mikoto ...... is used beautifully. Make the first level adventurer ...... a big surprise." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ Yes!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with Lili as well as Naza's awareness, fate could no longer say more. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p285"></a>Aisha silently looked at the young girls who nodded firmly and cocked the corners of her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll take care of the tavern group. Don't miss, little one!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"『Yes! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Amazon's eye crystal glowed and gave the final instruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's almost time for the level-up effect! Haruhime-sama's next spell is the signal to start the battle! </p>

<p class="calibre1">「--Noga! Go to the enemy reserve!!!'' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfrigg's defiant voice cut through the battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's a magician or a demon magician who can use a foul-level enhancement magic (jutsu)! Get rid of that guy!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!!! Yes, sir!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  werewolf  group  members  immediately  acted  according  to  the  first  level adventurer's instructions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He took the remaining tough warriors and launched an attack towards the battle whore crouching in front of the grave. The blushing Aisha and the Mikoto girls tried to stop them, but they were stopped by the linking of the prum quadruplets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfrigg's judgment was very accurate. Even in a crisis, his head and intuition is very good. First level adventurers are still very conspicuous. This also means that the Gulliver brothers, who had intended to use the most simple method to clear the enemy with power, began to use "tactics". </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the best evidence that the first level adventurers were being pushed into a desperate situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fire ------!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oooh ----!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  tough  warriors  approached  the  reserve  in  an  instant,  and  as  a  greeting, several『Magic swords』were shot out in unison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  guards  (Amazons)  who  were  protecting  only  one  girl  stepped  forward  and turned into shields, but the wind pressure with flames and lightning still affected Haruhime who was in the center of the reserve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haruhime! It's okay ...... is strange! Your body is manifesting itself!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......! Fellows-sama's magic prop (cloak) ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the words of the Amazon girl, Reina, who was running over in a panic, Haruhime was taken aback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Goliath  Cloak"  that  Haruhime  was  equipped  with  protected  her,  but  the transparent cloth (Reverse Spirit Veil) that was draped over it was blown  away, </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p286"></a>just like a rag, and completely broken. Although it was a magic item borrowed from the original sage (Ferros), it was now in this state and could no longer be turned into a 'transparent state'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Rena, what's wrong! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Samira, Haruhime can't become transparent anymore! I can't use magic in this state! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up ahead, the Tough Warrior and the Battle Whore finally collided, when the gray-haired Amazon in charge of the reserve team, Samira, came running over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This battle will be broadcasted to the whole city, right? Haruhime's 'secret' will be exposed! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What should we do, run away as Aisha said! But there doesn't seem to be any companions other than us ......! The Lord God (Hathor) is still alive ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Reina's  voice  was  getting  smaller  and  smaller,  and  Sharmila  couldn't  give instructions immediately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Level ascension is the most secret ritual that should be kept secret. Even that god of beauty (Ishtar) cheered because of this full movie, and once it was revealed, there would definitely be some guys who would want to take it for themselves. The caster, Haruhime, will be watched forever and will never be able to spend her days in peace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the war games, Aisha gave a strict order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the level of sublimation is going to be exposed, then stop using sorcery and run away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(But ah, if you run away with Haruhime now, Aisha and the girls will ......!) As  Reina  said,  the  only  ones  left  here,  including  Sharmila,  are  Hathor's dependents. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aron and others' 『Hunting Gods』 caused most of the main gods to go out, and many Amazons in the reserve team had left. More critically, if we lose Haruhime's rank  in  this  situation,  the  balance  between  Aisha's  girls  and  Runoa's  girls  will definitely be broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether to follow the instructions of big sister, or maintain the battle line. While the sweating Samira was struggling with this - </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm going to start chanting ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haruhime didn't wait for them to make a judgment and stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The magic will expire soon ...... must be re-given for the next level up ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait, wait, wait... I said no, Haruhime! Aisha will be angry with us, and it will be hard for Haruhime if she is exposed! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p287"></a>The  side  of  Haruhime's  face,  whose  transparency  had  been  lifted,  was  dripping with sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a sign of mental fatigue. The amount of mental energy recovery medicine that I had brought before the battle had already been used up. The combination of chanting link and level ascension would have produced a huge consumption, and in order to support the adventurers on the front line, Haruhime never stopped using magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without Haruhime, Lily's strategy and the current battle situation would never have been realized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is the 'behind-the-scenes' of this war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even so ...... my daughter will sing ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is because she cannot fight directly or command, so to speak, nothing can be accomplished, so the young girl has to continue to sing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Enough to make the former [Ishtar familia] amazons hold their breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haruhime ...... you ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharmila stared at the fox-man maiden without moving a muscle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Lena is right, if the level ascension is exposed, there will be no turning back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There will be another commotion like 『Killing Stone』. ...... No, it definitely will." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unknowingly, she even forgot that she was still fighting and asked so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The situation in the future may be even more excessive than that of Ishtar-sama's time ...... Is that okay? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharmila subconsciously strengthened the tone, and the next moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My daughter does not care! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't care, Sharmila-sama! Reina-sama!!! The safety of this body or whatever!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haruhime replied as if her mind was made up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How valuable can a girl who is only protected be? How can a despicable woman who disregards her companions and even abandons her beloved man be qualified to enjoy the sunshine of spring? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haruhime ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lord Bell is going to be snatched away! The familia (Hestia-sama and the others) will feel sad! I don't want that! I can't do that! The Haruhime who was  protected and saved is long gone! </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was not the young girl that Sharmila and the girls knew well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am no longer a symbol of destruction! Not some whore who only cries! I am the Haruhime of the Hestia Familia! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The harlot who once lamented about ruin was no longer there. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p288"></a>What was there was a 'sorcerer'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ Haruhime. I used to hate you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alongside Reina who was frozen in place, Sharmila said so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  the  truth.  Unlike  Aisha,  who  couldn't  resist  because  of  the  'charm'  of  the beauty god (Ishtar), and Reina, who was threatened, Sharmila, who was in charge of the sacrificial vessel, was very active in promoting the 'killing stone' ritual. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because she didn't care. The weak woman who couldn't do anything by herself by crying and crying didn't matter at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She wanted to enjoy the battle with the powerful males (Freya's familia) by using the lives of the young girls she was upset with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"However, you are ...... really nice now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lord Samira ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The emerald green eyes opened wide, and Sharmila smiled at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing her favorite『powerful female』, she slammed her fist into her palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay, sing, sing! Go ahead and sing, Haruhime!!! We're here to protect you!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh eh, Sharmila! Is that okay?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course it's okay! We'll protect her if she's targeted by a dirty guy! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's not good at all! That's not going to be Haruhime's amulet for the rest of her life...? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Samira turned around and ran towards the battle whores who were pinned down by the tough warriors. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  whining  Reina  also  chased  after  them,  when  the  gray-haired  warrior  woman turned back to the frozen Haruhime and said </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do it, Haruhime!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haruhime responded to her with a smile, and a nod. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Nine-Fold]--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic power of the heterogeneous mass began to gather. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time, the magic that had been guarded by the transparent Kagami was exposed to the light of day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[beloved Snow, Crimson of Compassion, White Light of Deep Love]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the countless 『mirrors』 that reflected the battlefield scene, the eyes of the people immediately stopped at the golden light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sudden appearance of the fox man drew the attention of the adventurers and the gods in the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Please  also  accompany  its  side  -  Watching  the  wish  of  love  for  two  thousand nights]" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p289"></a>The poetry piped in, and the light flamed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  verses  wove  fluidly  into  shape,  and  even  the  eyes  in  the  battlefield  were robbed of their gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[My  name is Fox Demon,  a symbol  of the brokenness of the past. My  name is Ancient Ballad, symbolizing the thought of the past. I would like to invite the nine demons to board this body as the royal body that spreads its wings and soars]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tough warriors found their target. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They found out that it was the "demon fox" that could kill them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So they exuded a terrifying aura to crush that female fox no matter what. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The golden song was played and the poem was summoned by Tamao. White-faced and golden-haired, the king of the nine tails]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The battle whores let out a roar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They exhaled their anger, and no one would ever hurt that once little sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That fox (fool) has made a roar, so they have to let out a louder cry themselves, so they shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Swallowing all things, fulfilling all expectations, the tail of the Rui-beast"---" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharmila was beating hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was  beating her enemies  harder than anyone else,  kicking them to pieces, destroying her own limbs, and yet still fighting fiercely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together with Reina, she formed a dividing line on the earth, keeping the warriors on this side of the line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"-[Get Big]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chanting link. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The special level empowering magic was woven, and now it was replaced by the song that Sharmila and the girls had heard countless times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Its power and its deeds, countless treasures and countless wishes. When the Bell rings, pray for glory and illusion - grow bigger]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was still accelerating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The song, which I have mastered through countless chants, puts on the armor of </p>
<p class="calibre1">"high-speed chanting" and speeds through time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Swallowing the divine food of this body. Give the golden light of the gods. Giving the hammer back to the earth, giving blessing]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strong warriors gathered all their strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only this one to be stopped, they roar loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The battle whores used all their strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They shouted not to let the opponent come closer, and even those who had fallen rose again, grabbed the warriors' feet, and dragged them down. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p290"></a>Unable to advance. Not to be allowed to advance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unreachable. Do not let them reach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The furious orcs burst into a flash of light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Samira was pierced through the shoulder by the shot, which was much superior to her own, but she smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She spat blood and laughed as she yanked the orc male (Noga) in the chest and unleashed a headbutt with all her might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The man rolled his eyes as his forehead was crushed along with the helmet above him, and the warrior woman fell to the ground with him while whispering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Go on. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[---Get bigger]!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haruhime gave a response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She carved the figures of her sisters who were guarding her into her eyes, burned with tears, and sang this 『Trump Card』. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"[Manabu Mallet] - [Let's dance]! </p>

<p class="calibre1">What descended was a 『miracle』 of the highest level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya, Chloe, Runoa, Mikoto, Naza, and Aisha. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  six  tails  that  rose  to  after  sublimation  were  poured  in,  and  the  greatest strengthening of the self army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The intuitive adventurer and the omniscient gods instantly reacted to what exactly was the 『Organs』 that had given the faction valve allied army an overwhelming gain since the beginning of the war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no longer a way back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, holding the crystal in one hand, Lily who heard Haruhime's realization - she shouted out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Action begins! </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was all that was called. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The signal that sounded together with the brilliant golden light, first summoned a throw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a blackened ball that was thrown from Lily's side and landed at the feet of the four brothers who were fighting with Runoa and the girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It passed through the gap between the  adventurers, landed  on top of the stone slab, and then exploded violently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Smoke screen!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Smoke grenade?!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p291"></a>To be precise, it was a magic prop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  the  black  mist  that  Fellows  had  made  on  the  occasion  of  rescuing  the heretics and even deceiving the [Loki Familia]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strange black smoke seemed to be alive and wrapped around their limbs, and Alfrigg and the others not only couldn't see Runoa and the girls, but they even lost their brothers (each other) in their vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Such tricks! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Trying to stop us from linking up! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black fog was even sticky, blocking all information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only vision, but also the sense of smell had lost its proper function. The only thing  that  was  still  working  properly  was  the  sense  of  hearing.  Even  the  four brothers who claimed to be one mind and one body, passing on their hearts with their minds were isolated into separate individuals in this instant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「--[Budou Mikoto]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the next moment, a powerful gravity hit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  fierce  heavy  pressure  poured  in  from  the  top  of  their  heads,  causing  the  four brothers' bodies to sink. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「「「「 goo woo woo woo woo woo!? 」」」」 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind the level ascension, the magic of life carried out in secret. The Lv. 3-like release of the full power must kill the Lv. 5s, who were weakened by the abnormal magic,  to  be  forced  to  create  a  delay  in  action.  The  gravity  caused  the  magical black  smoke  to  be  compressed  as  well,  and  in  this  strange  situation, communication with each other became more difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The damage gradually accumulated. However, it was still possible to disengage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A prison of this level could not defeat [Inferno Gold Four Warriors]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The problem was the direction of disengagement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nine times out of ten, the enemy was waiting for Alfrigg and the others to break through this dark and gravity prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  they  break  through  separately,  they  are  likely  to  be  broken  separately.  Four people must break away together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment the fierce gravity kept eroding the strength, the anxiety sprouted in the hearts of Alfrigg and others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Two o'clock! There was no sign of the enemy in the northeast!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">-- Berling's voice! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing  the  instruction  from  the  three  men,  who  were  known  for  their  ability  to claim the enemy among the brothers, Alfrigg, Duvaline and Grer moved in unison in  step.  Before  they  were  put  into  the  black  prison,  the  first  level  adventurers </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p292"></a>grasped exactly where they and others were as well as their bearings and prepared to break away with their terrifying foot strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They threw off the bonds of gravity, and first Duvalin, followed by Grer, then Alfrigg, and finally, it was Bellin who burst out of the prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Coming out from this side! Let's go together!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The adventurers then swarmed together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following  Aisha's  voice,  Runoa  and  Chloe  launched  a  strong  attack  from  three directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the result of course. The voices of the three men (Berling) also reached the ears of their opponents. They merely evaded the ambush, but they were also responded instantly and had no work to confirm the current situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, none of this was worth mentioning. To the [Inferno Gold Four Warriors] </p>
<p class="calibre1">it was just a trivial matter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As soon as they entered each other's view, they understood what the rest of the brothers were going to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was also known what one was going to do. The unity of information of the shakai is the secret of "infinite connection". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The eldest man (Alfrigg) with a gun came to meet Amazon's big parka. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second male (Duvaline)'s sledgehammer to crush the catman's dagger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The third male (Berling)'s great axe cut through the gloves the human was wearing as well as herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the fourth male (Grer) set up a great sword in the air to release a roundhouse slash, sweeping the three away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  [Inferno  Gold  Four  Warriors]  instantly  conjured  up  the  same  vision  in  their minds and implemented it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Useless!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nagao's (Alfrigg's) gun knocked away Aisha's large Park Blade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Meow!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Useless!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Second male's (Duvaline) sledgehammer bounces off Allen's dagger and smashes it to pieces. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"I told you it didn't work!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the third male's (Berling) sledgehammer splits Runoa who is about to beat up the fourth male (Grer). </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the end of everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p293"></a>This is how it should have been. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Karma! ---- eh" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa's iron fist sunk into the side of the four men (Grer) who were ready to attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time stood still. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A fatal murmur sounded in the brothers' minds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this instant, 『Infinite Connections』 was indeed disrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you doing, Berling!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind himself, at the end of the queue, Alfrigg roared back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In an instant, Alfrigg saw it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three men (Berling) who were moving in a completely different direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Wearing a sand-colored hood and armor, it was the『brother』with unarmed and empty fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfrigg's consciousness went blank for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"---, ---, ---!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black mist shook up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In that depth, he saw it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three men (Berling) who were captured by the center of gravity, unable to even make a sound, and still pinned to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「「・・」 </p>
<p class="calibre1">The momentary blankness created by the eldest male (Alfrigg) and the fragments of information were  also shared with the second  male (Duvaline) and the fourth male (Grer). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was deliberate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was deliberate to make Alfrigg, Dvalinn, and Grer get out of the prison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This black gravity boundary was not aimed at the four people from the beginning, but from the beginning it was just staring at『just one person』and locked them in the『cage』in it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was only a magic box to replace the 'fake' with the 'real'! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  time  needed  to  grasp  the  state  of  affairs  under  the  impact  was  only  half  a second. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The world was still flowing slowly, and in the drastically compressed physical time, Alfrigg let out a roar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--who the hell are you! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The long spear immediately swung out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p294"></a>In the face of the blow that approached from the side, 『The brother-like being』 </p>
<p class="calibre1">defended by putting his left hand next to his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next moment, the "magic" was canceled due to damage beyond the limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Numerous particles dissipated and a young girl appeared beneath the gray magic light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Lili Luka Ardei...?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Transformation magic『Zao Grey Girl』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A trick that only Lily is qualified to use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  this  child  trick  covered  with  soot  was  about  to  bring  about  a  "step  of reversal". </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I can't...) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily ignored Alfrigg who was dumbfounded, and her distorted eyes began to fill with blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  floating  feet,  the  body  that  gradually  drifted  to  the  side,  the  short  body  that would be knocked away at high speed after a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The flesh and blood broke, and the bones easily cracked left arm with a burning pain - but Lilly did not cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Don't cry - !!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess sacrifice who had her arm broken by her compatriot (Alfrigg) in front of  her,  the  sorrowful  cry  that  came  out  in  disgrace  and  the  tears  that  fell  were swallowed into the depths of her bitten lips, and she reached her hand towards the </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Winning opportunity』 that she had finally snatched up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Lily is the commander-!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The adventurers were sacrificed and the gods were used as bait. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the last one to be used was myself. To stand up is this body (body) that can not be used. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  should  be  no  discouraging  words.  Confusion  and  tears  should  be abandoned. Even yourself must be used as a decisive hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The commander engraved the teachings of the brave into his body and mind, and roared towards "victory". </p>
<p class="calibre1">(As long as these four people are together, there is no "loophole"...) This was the opinion that Lily had just arrived at. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was an absolute solution to the four warriors' connection. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(--Then, as long as there is one less person, 『loophole』 will be created!) And that was also found ahead of the desperate conclusion, the simple answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just make four minus one, and the 'infinite connection' will be reduced to 'finite'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The world of the prum will end. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p295"></a>Only  the  high-speed  thinking  shared  by  the  villain,  the  constantly  accelerating physical time would come to an end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily's right hand that had wrapped around the belt pouch grabbed『that』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfrigg, Duvaline and Grer comprehended this dangerous situation and were about to rally again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the flash of Lily's right hand was a little faster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ignoring Aisha and the girls, a vial was thrown in the center of the three brothers who were about to assemble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the one that was obtained from the All Mighty (Asfi) -『Explosive Pill』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「「「Ka! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It flew in three directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  blossoming  explosive  flowers  made  the  villainous  warriors  fly  to  the  east, south and west respectively. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily also tumbled on the earth with the momentum of a dike, and at this time the </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Inferno Gold Four Warriors] were completely separated. </p>

<p class="calibre1">This was the perfect opportunity and the time for a reversal. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"... You've really done a lot so far." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">East. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of Grer, who stood up with his greatsword, stood a woman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her  short  woolen  hair  was  combed  by  the  wind,  and  her  fists  were  wrapped  in blood-stained gloves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa, the rematcher (avenger) who lost to the Four Warriors until today, stared at her hated enemy with her eyebrows raised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll pay you back for what I owe you so far! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't  underestimate  people,  don't  underestimate  people,  don't  underestimate people! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa charged forward from the front, and Grer charged forward as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just like during the Goddess Festival, he swung down his great sword to cut her down to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa, on the other hand, suddenly stopped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Grer, who was separated from his brother, shaken and eager to split the victory, felt anxious, and Runoa didn't let that go and lured him into swinging empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p296"></a>And the move released by the fighter who played an exceptionally good 'strategy' </p>
<p class="calibre1">was naturally the long-awaited full power punch cannon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bzzzzzzzz! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The left fist's Belly strike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  hit  Grer's  abdomen  with  a  smash  sound  like  an  explosion,  and  then  swung upward like a salvage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, using the fist that was stuck in his abdomen as a starting point, he aimed at the villain's (Grer's) bent body to the limit and decisively threw a continuous punch (Rush). </p>

<p class="calibre1">The Fist Riot kicked off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Straight  punches,  hooks,  uppercuts,  elbows,  backhand  punches,  digging  into Grer's  whole  body  from  all  angles,  destroying  the  greatsword  slipping  from  his hands </p>
<p class="calibre1">, smashing helmets and shattering armor while delivering a painful beating. The little  man's  body  never  hit  the  ground,  floating  in  the  air  to  take  the  continuous bomb-like blows. </p>

<p class="calibre1">--In  the  era  when  Orario  was  surrounded  by  chaos,  there  was  a  『Bounty Hunter』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had made a name for herself outside of the city with her fists alone, and had solved many high-level adventurers, and had never lost a battle until she met the </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Inferno Gold Four Warriors]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was so committed to fighting people head-on that the target's blood spilled out and stained her gloves red and black. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Based on this, she received a common name that is not an alias - "Black Fist". </p>
<p class="calibre1">She is a pure infighter who does not rely on magic, but only uses her outstanding </p>
<p class="calibre1">"power" to defeat her enemies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Death! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The final blow smashed into Grer's chest, shattering the stone slab Bellow in the process. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kah, ah..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The little human was buried in the sinking earth, spitting out blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The helmet and goggles all lost in the eyes, consciousness gradually far away, a jerk, the head lost strength, silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes!!! See!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p297"></a>She stroked the wound that had been cut by the great sword and swung her fist into the wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A winning smile emerged from the woman who loved fighting more than anyone else. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Grer!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">West. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  his  brother  who  was  sinking  with  the  speedy  strong  attack,  Duvalin shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Still have the heart to worry about brother meow~?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat's purr was thrown at his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A smile like a mockery and a sneer appeared on Chloe's face and he pounced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To this extent-! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The explosive charge produced a storm of sandy wind. She rushed out from it with a breath and launched a surprise attack from the rear, but Duvalin still reacted. He raised the sledgehammer that should be called a large iron ball and smashed the careless cat to pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's right, literally, Chloe's whole body was shattered to pieces『in pieces』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[[Phyrexia Cruise]]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat figure that dissipated in front of his eyes startled Grer, and immediately after that, a magic name flew into his ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The real name of the super short chanting magic that had already been chanted was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">("Phantom Magic"?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat that disappeared as magic residue (phantom) surprised Duvalin, and this time, the real surprise attack was approaching him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the first level adventurer (Duvalin) reacted to even that and smashed the Chloe that launched the attack from above his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was shattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What a pity. Phantoms can have up to three." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--Gooah!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The real body (Chloe) disturbed with two phantoms, while he jumped out of the smoke from the first one. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p298"></a>Forced  to  use  the  second  strike,  the  unsteady  frame  Duvalin  was  sliced  by  her back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The weapon that was cut down was not the dagger that was broken before, but a short sword with a weird black and purple color. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This child is called "Violet" meow~. It is a special product of Meow~" that absorbed the severe poison - fierce poison of the monsters of the lower deep (dungeon) Seeing  the  cat  flaunting  this  evil  weapon  of  his,  the  villainous  human  who  was having a hard time holding himself together was about to cuss. </p>
<p class="calibre1">How  could  a  first  level  adventurer  (himself)  go  down  because  of  a  mere  fierce poison (something like that) - he was about to roar so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"---- Karma?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he couldn't do it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blood spat out from Duvalin's mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you trying to say that 'poison' doesn't work against a first level adventurer's proud  and  well-trained  'abnormal  resistance  (ability)'?  ----  no  ~~~~~~~  door </p>
<p class="calibre1">~~~~~~~" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Chloe is a little 'meow~~~' a little. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A cruel, dank, sadistic, evil smile of the highest order emerged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anya's  disaster  tone-deaf  (magic)  can  even  diminish  the  effect  of  abnormal resistance (ability)." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--------" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having  produced  a  fatal  oversight  himself,  hearing  this  information  from  the omitted former member of the group (Anya), Duvaline froze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The villain's mouth began to spit out large chunks of pitch-black blood, at which point the cat's lips outlined into the shape of a crescent moon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If it becomes like this - even Meow can beat up Meow♪" </p>

<p class="calibre1">Fierce Venom's dagger danced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aiming at the slit in the armor slashed the decapitation filament. Duvaline's limbs were dismantled in great pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">More  toxins  eroded  the  body  and  blood  spurted  from  all  the  holes,  causing  the villain's body to finally collapse to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kah, cough, goo ah ah ah ah ah ah ......! --uh goo!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Duvaline was lying on top of the cracked stone slab when the cat's heel (high heel) stepped on his cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, hey, what's the mood now~?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kahhhhhhh ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p299"></a>"What's the mood now after being treated like a mongrel by an opponent who was thought to be a mongrel ~~~~?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">--There was once an "assassin" who was active in the same period as the "Black Fist". </p>
<p class="calibre1">This woman completely hid her nature and never used proper tactics, but used all kinds of sneak attacks and made a great contribution to the assassination industry in the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The poisoned blade that dances is the tail of a cat. If you hear a meowing sound, it is a harbinger of a tragic death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  a  contrast  to『Black  Fist』who  liked  to  face  each  other  head-on,  she  got  a common name, 『Black Cat』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She stepped on the side of the first rank adventurer, twisting her foot from time to time, and her back trembled uncontrollably with excitement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This one hand on the hot cheek, full of pleasure, even to put it mildly, the word evil is used to describe it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As for my current mood, of course it's great." </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo, woo! </p>

<p class="calibre1">Inside the boundary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With all his strength, Berling finally broke the heavy pressure magic (Budou Mikoto) that had been compressed to the limit by fate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  magic  exploded  along  with  the  gravity  prison  shattered,  and  the  black  fog gradually dispersed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the figures of the three brothers (Alfrigg and the others) who were fighting separately around him, Berling received a great shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had to resume "Linking" immediately... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Black Shadow Forward. Darkness descends. My arm is a crown of fading]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, at that moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An unlived chant stopped the steps of Berling who was planning to go to support his brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Inuyasha - that sniper!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first time that Naza, who was focused on sniping with her bow and arrow, used a 『magic』 of unknown origin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anxiety burns. Fearing what she was going to do again, Berling quickly changed direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p300"></a>"The  ugly  worm,  the  flesh  that  is  eaten,  the  heart  that  is  abused.  The  torture  is inflicted on silver, writhing and moving, the sound of vibrating wings]--! </p>

<p class="calibre1">The distance disappeared instantly. The great ax that would never let go aimed at Naza and swung down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chanting was completed. But this side's attack was faster than magic. Never let her do anything redundant again!!! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  Berling's  decisive  strike  -『Bait  (Naza)』seemed  to  have  seen  through everything and extended her right hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although the ability was reduced, the first rank adventurer's chop should have been able to cut the right arm along with the opponent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was blocked by a hard texture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「Sh--Silver Righteous Hand! </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  metallic  glow  appeared  among  the  cracked  sleeve  and  glove.  It  was  not  an artificial arm of flesh and blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Silver Arm (Airgetlám)". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Berling didn't even investigate the information related to the worthless "trash", and a shock ran through him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  the  "Silver  Arm",  which  was  cut  in  half  and  had  several  extra  joints caused by the impact, was like a silver snake and wrapped around the ax. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, here you go." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naza, who had sacrificed her righteous hand and only avoided the blow, narrowed her eyes at the flying debris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consider it a payment, she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">InuYasha handed out her righteous hand, which still had a huge amount of money owed to her, and unleashed her only『Magic』without holding back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Demon Beetle! </p>
<p class="calibre1">A large amount of 『Dark particles』 was released. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A horrible swarm of light particles like a swarm of insects emerged from the broken silver arm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The evasive maneuver failed to avoid the radiation from extremely close range, and the little human was swallowed up in it, and was then rendered speechless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no damage. Instead, it was replaced by a fierce『fatigue』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Could it be - abnormal magic!?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naza's magic [Demon Beetle]. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p301"></a>Like Anya, her『magic』was『abnormal magic』. It was something that appeared from a girl who had lost her right arm and was physically and mentally weakened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically, it was the guilt of putting her faction (familia) in crisis and causing the main god (Miach) to suffer that triggered the symbol of "decline". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You guys, one after another, ah ah ah! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling the abnormal magic of the iterations decreasing his ability again, Berling became extremely angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He threw off the 『Silver Arm』 that was wrapped around his ax, and this time he was determined to slaughter Naza. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, even faster than that, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm grateful, Sir Naza-" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Overhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mikoto, who was flying in the air, put his hand on his sheathed long sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naza was a 'decoy'. In order to prevent Bellyn from rejoining Alfrigg and the others </p>
<p class="calibre1">- in order to stop『Link』from resurrecting, she deliberately sang a spell in a loud voice to draw the consciousness (hatred value) over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mikoto, who had been entrusted with the task of『closing up』by Naza, made a response with her full strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Jediwa!!!" </p>

<p class="calibre1">The chopping flash burst out and ran through Berling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Juihwa stance" directly transmitted by the Mushain inflicted a fatal wound on the first rank adventurer whose ability had been reduced to the limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of a villain falling to the ground rang out. There was also the sound of Naza, who had lost her righteous hand, falling to the ground due to the backlash of magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only maiden standing sheathed her sword after her heart was broken. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Grer, Duvalin, Berling!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, it was the South. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surprise  dominated  Alfrigg's  body  when  he  saw  his  brothers  being  broken separately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(It was counted from the beginning--!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily from the brave (someone) firmly grasped the brothers among the three men (Berling)  is  good  at  soaking  the  enemy  and  other  [Yanjin  four  warriors]  various information and habits. In this war game, that fellow girl must have been observing </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p302"></a>them even  more as  much  as possible. Otherwise just imitating the appearance, himself  (Alfrigg)  these  few  people  as  well  as  able  to  see  through  his  disguised brothers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Even  the  attack  of  that  goddess  festival  seen  from  extremely  close  range  was used as disguise material ...... and then fooled us!?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily used the only weapon 『Transformation magic』 and kept waiting for Alfrigg and their 『baiting moment』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking at the young girl who had exhausted her strength in the corner of the field of vision and fell to the ground, Alfrigg really became speechless this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「[Come on, Overlord of Savage Courage]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the large Park Blade and the blazing 『Parallel Chant』 attacked Alfrigg's body that had not yet gotten rid of the faltering. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aisha,  who  would  never  be  proud  and  arrogant,  vowed  that  the  only  thing  she would not waste was the 『winning opportunity』 created by catching Lily and the others, and came to defeat her opponent with all her strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three  of  her  brothers  had  already  been  attacked.  The  only  one  left  was  Alfrigg alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Liliruca Arde's plan of "Separate Breakdown" opened up a hole for "Infinite Link". </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the day of the Goddess Festival, the girl who Alfrigg agreed with finally defeated the [Inferno Gold Four Warriors]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My thirsty blade is called Hippolyta! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  didn't  take  long  for  Aisha,  whose  body  was  covered  with  cracks  from  the resistance of the lance, to finish her chant in one breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Hel-Kaios]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A vertical strike swung down from directly above. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the nick of time, he set up his spear horizontally and built up a defensive stance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lance crossed with the big sword in the shape of a cross and caught it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this was his limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A red chopping wave was emitted from the sword, which was held by the hilt. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The huge demon blade, which was far taller than his own height, struck directly into his body, and Alfrigg's fate was now sealed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lance was split in half and slammed into the tomb wall with him, receiving a violent blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Take that, little one! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p303"></a>Aisha roared in victory as she finally took down the [Inferno Gold Four Warriors]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa, Chloe, Mikoto and Naza also let out the same shout, and Haruhime, who was sitting on the ground, also showed a sweaty smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you very much, everyone ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sharp pain caused by the crushing fracture almost made Lily's consciousness fly away, when the song of victory made her awake again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  forced  up  her  face,  which  was  lying  on  the  ground,  to  confirm  her surroundings, and the battle situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except  for  Haruhime,  the  reserve  team  had  all  been  destroyed.  But  the  battle whores also managed to die with the strong warriors of the orcs. Now that Alfrigg and the  others  had fallen, the only  one left was Allen who was still fighting with Anya. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Anyone!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  last  remaining  first  level  adventurer.  This  can  be  managed  by  yourself  and others. It will definitely be solved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So Lilly struggled to move her right hand that was still moving and brought the eye crystal to her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From her body, which was covered in blood and dust, she spoke to the whole army as loudly as she could. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is there anyone who can still move? </p>



<p class="calibre1">"The enemy's main battle force has been largely destroyed! The only ones left are the [Fierce] and the [Goddess Chariot]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young girl's voice was heard throughout the city ruins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The [Fierce] will be taken care of by Bell-sama and the [Goddess Chariot] by Lily! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  commander  called  out  to  the  eye  crystals  scattered  all  over  the  battlefield, calling for friendly troops. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Those who can still move, please go west! Please go to support Bell-sama and go to Freya-sama! This is the first and last good chance! Get the『Flower』of the Goddess! Get the victory! Please ...... is there anyone! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  crushed  martial  instruments,  the  adventurers  whose  consciousness  was broken listened to Lily's voice without words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  adventurers  who  hadn't  been  picked  up  by  the  [Ganesha  Familia]  and  the tough  warriors  couldn't  move.  All  of  them  were  as  motionless  as  corpses.  The silence in the ruins that were destroyed in the past says it all. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p304"></a>The warriors, who had exhausted their strength before the end, could not respond to the plea of the maiden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anyone ...... Anyone ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lilly-san ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The communication that spread along the crystal and resounded all around, the only one who heard it, tears flowed from Cassandra's eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She herself had lost the right to fight. To save Daphne, she swore an oath to Hogni. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She cursed herself for not fighting to the end as her friend had said, and felt regret while holding Daphne, who was still sleeping on her chest, tightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound made by the maiden who desperately reached out and tried to reach victory was drawn helplessly into the vault that covered the relics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"........................... .............................. ....................." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, 『He』 slowly twitched his eyelids. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Kicking  away  the  urge  to  drown  in  the  darkness,  he  forced  his  mind  to  become clear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no strength to answer the young girl. But, it should still be possible to answer her wish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So he moved his body. However, it did not go very well. He was now in a half-dead state, similar to the adventurers who had fallen around with all their strength. It was incredible to wake up. Consciousness was interrupted several times, and the time of forward flight was finely sliced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So he relied on the prop. The cure-all, said to be completed by the canine, was slowly drawn out of his belt pouch. Even so, lying on his back, the most he could do was to turn his face sideways. There was no choice but to sprinkle the potion inside on top of the stone slab where his cheek was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like a shipwrecked man who hungrily slurped muddy water, he miserably kissed the puddle of allspice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually he regained his vitality. Not completely, but at least he got it back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then one can still move. Even if he couldn't stand up, he could still crawl forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He  picked  up  the  martial  arts  equipment  that  had  rolled  down  to  his  hand  and crawled forward, very ugly, but solidly, toward the location of the goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin looked at the sight in silence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did not intervene. Nor did he help. But relatively speaking, he did not stop either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  a  strong-willed  person  really  wants  to  crawl  through,  then  no  matter  how unbearable it is, he will not stop it. Because this is the proof of 'struggling to become a capable person'. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p305"></a>For the same reason, he also did not intervene in the fierce battle between Lily and Aisha and others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At first he did want to mind his own business. But they were far more capable than Hedin had expected. With this ability, they fought back Alfrigg and others. All that was left was a 『Chariot』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then it was obvious where he should go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as he thought that, the moment he was about to turn around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"He-, fixed ............!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black elf that was covered in bruises called out to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The right half of the upper body's battle suit had been burned away by the flame flower. The slender but well-trained chest and abdominal muscles were exposed, just like the defeated. The brown skin was also badly burnt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni pressed his wound and gasped in pain, glaring at Hedin as if he wanted to kill him with his gaze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you, what are you doing ......! Why, to betray Freya-sama ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... have just explained it to Haider." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now! I'm the one asking you!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He used his entire injured body and let out an unusually angry voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  self-transformation  magic  (Daineslef)  has  been  lifted.  Not  the  war  lord  who ravaged the battlefield, but the most real words of Hogni Ragnar himself whacked the expressionless white elf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are  you  kidding  me,  Hedin  ......!  In  that  cursed  island,  that  unknown  homeland (Hegene), we have always fought, and the one who saved us ...... is not Freya-sama ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Isn't that the same lord who has freed us from the king's bondage! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He whacked the sight of the day he swore loyalty to the goddess with a blow from yesteryear to his compatriot in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Opening his eyes and understanding the betrayal of Hedin, the one who was hit the hardest was undoubtedly Hogni. The black elf showed his anger completely, his weepy eyes filled with tears, and his trembling fist swung out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Obviously so, you guys ah ah ah-!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A dry voice rang out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wounded fist, which the first level adventurer could easily dodge, was received by Hedin's cheek. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p306"></a>Only the fist of the black elf who had the same origin as himself had the right to beat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  glasses  that  flew  up  from  the  man's  face  and  fell  to  the  ground  murmured quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We are the only ones who can't betray that lord aaaahhhh-! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't go too far fool." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo Hoo Eh!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But this is only once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no second time for the right of beating, the ghostly elf so indicated and hit back with a cold look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The already half-dead Hogni received an excellent iron fist to the face and looked like he was about to faint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Being beaten so badly by a fellow little girl, and still here to say something stupid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, how can you be my opponent now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait, goo, poo poo! Stop, stop it, stop it! You just can't do this kind of place ah really Hedin! Ah good pain good pain wait a minute!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally  even  stretched  out  his  foot  and  tripped  Hogni,  thud!  Dang!!!  The  ground falls rain on the sole of the shoe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The overly hyper-rationalistic, bloodless and tearless white elf caused the black elf to cry out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You ask why I committed the crime? It's because it's necessary." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At  this  rate,  Freya-sama  will  be  lost.  Her  'expectation'  will  be  lost,  and  she  will never be able to get it again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin, who had stopped his feet, said so, and after hearing that Hogni looked up in confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If it wasn't that stupid rabbit, Freya-sama wouldn't have been saved. I have come to this conclusion." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's  why  I've  worked  that  one  out  until  today.  I've  been  adjusting  so  that  he won't be swallowed up by 『Boxing』. No matter what the ending is, there is no future  ahead  of  "Love".  Relying  on  『Goddess's  love』-can't  fulfill  that  lord's </p>
<p class="calibre1">『expectation』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So Hedin gave 『Cruelty』 to Bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the solid 『Boxing』 was completed, he outwardly pretended to be a cruel warrior  like  Allen  and  others,  and  exercised  Bell's  body  and  mind  to  the  limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because  he  comprehended  that  this  was  necessary  regardless  of  whether  the </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p307"></a>『box court』 was destroyed or not. Even if he did not anticipate this kind of faction war, in the future scenario that Hedin Selander was expecting, Bell Cronin had to reject the goddess' 『Love』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether it was kicking the teenager in the back and pushing him into hell, or seeing the  limits  of  his  heart  that  would  not  yield,  or  unlocking  the  surveillance  of  the faction valve and ignoring his communication with Mia, all was his intention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was absolutely no need to be ruthless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because Hedin originally approached Bell with such an intention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The journey that began with the transformation of the goddess festival would have the goddess as the ultimate goal no matter what. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's why Freya was not able to doubt Hedin's loyalty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because the『reBellion』that he was also carrying out now was all for the master's sake, there was no『lie』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Redemption ......? 『Expectation』......? What are you talking about, Hedin!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stop pretending to be a fool, fool." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't you also vaguely perceive it." </p>

<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p class="calibre1">You  (Hegyi),  who  played  the  role  of  "King"  like  yourself  (Hedin),  should  have sensed something even if you didn't understand it in your head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The red coral colored eyes shot through Hegyi who was speechless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If  you're  not  that  stupid  rabbit,  you  won't  be  able  to  liberate  that  lord.  Why? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because 『she』 chose that man." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  don't  know  if  it's  really  possible  to  save.  That  indecisive  guy  has  hurt『her』</p>
<p class="calibre1">many times. But even so ...... this is not something we can do. So it can only be entrusted to him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Hedin's even with resignation, emotionless words, Hogni couldn't stop his hands from trembling and stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is this ...... you're talking about, Hedin? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's just the truth." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What a joke! We'll guard it! Just like we've been doing! Let's be the strength and hands and feet of that lord, and not--! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just admit it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to cover it all, Hedin grabbed the front of Hogni's tattered clothes and yanked him over. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p308"></a>"You should know that too! We can guard the goddess, but we can't save her!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni's eyes widened to their limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't hide, say what you really mean! Say that you don't want to give your beloved goddess to another guy!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...? Why, why ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course I know! Because I am too! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The excited tone of Hedin's unconcealed sincerity took away Hogni's retreat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why should it be that guy? Why can't it be me! I'm the one who wants to be that lord's special person! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first time I saw the girl (Syr) and the boy (Bell). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing that smile, Hedin's heart was violently shaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was like forgetting that she was a goddess, innocent, full of joy, and an incredibly precious smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This smile was the 'real her', and with a shock, he understood this fact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then immediately, he felt jealousy. It was to Bell Cranel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why this little brat, he thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However - he perceived one thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess Freya would give 『love』 to Hedin and others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sea of love that no mortal could have, the ocean of infinite breadth and depth, would be distributed to those who thirsted for it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However - that 'love'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But only one person can be the target. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because she is the "Goddess of Love". </p>
<p class="calibre1">A clumsy, poor girl who doesn't know "love" because she is in charge of "love". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But that's not possible! We who worship the Goddess! We who are saved by the Goddess, who long for the Goddess, can't free her! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thirsting for the Goddess, fighting to love and be loved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This takes her away from "reality". It takes her away from "expectations". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  more  she  wants  to  be  a  goddess,  the  more  she  can't  fulfill  Freya's expectations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The more I try to be a goddess, the more I cannot realize Freya's expectations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What  kind  of  subordinate  is  one  who  cannot  discover  the  expectations  of  his master? What kind of loyalty is that! What kind of love is there if you can't protect her smile!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes that were close to her eyes cast a sincere determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Horne's hand shook convulsively. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p309"></a>"Horne, help me! Now, if you are willing to be deceived by my teasing, hand over your power!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"---!!! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let her, whom I want to save, be free from the 'yoke of the goddess'!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  mask  of  sanity  was  completely  thrown  off  the  face  of  the  elf  without  the glasses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was struck by the thoughts that were not false, and Hogni lost his strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both hands hung down weakly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">".................. Then come and lie to me, Hedin." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately after. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm a fool. And don't know what's right and what's wrong. Just a go-with-the-flow, useless 'king.'" </p>
<p class="calibre1">--There were two sad kings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elfs were divided into white and black, and on the lonely island where they killed each other, they were carried to the throne and killed as required. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black one was afraid of others, unable to resist his compatriots, cursing his weak-willed self as he did so, while fulfilling his mission. The white one spurned incompetence  and  became  a  reserved  slave,  his  pride  did  not  allow  him  to abandon his responsibilities and became a puppet of this small world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Imprisoned by the mark called King, they thought that they would at least crush the </p>
<p class="calibre1">'King' in the opponent's camp who was the exact opposite of themselves, leaving meaning to the birth of this body of theirs. The black one wanted to crush the white one, and the white one wanted to crush the black one. That was all the two had left to hope for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sorry. Your country, I have destroyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet the goddess saved them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gods destroyed the ugly island of the elves and freed the two kings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how others blamed her for what she did and called her a "witch", only the two elfs worshiped her. In order to free herself from the bondage called "king", she became a "witch" just for the sake of two people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni and Hedin, who no longer needed to be "King", knelt before the goddess and swore to be faithful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From that day on, the "King" died, and the White and Black Riders were born. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, I am a loser who lets others control my fate. --But!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He covered Hedin's hand that was grasping his front lapel with his own right hand and held it tightly, shouting at the pupil in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p310"></a>"Even so, I never knew Syr-sama! I didn't know 'she' could smile like that!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like Hedin, he recalled the girl's smile when she faced the teenager and spoke of his determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If she can smile like that, then I hope that god (person) can keep smiling!!! --so Hedin! I'll let you lie to me!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the black elf stare back at herself, shouting so as if in a contest, the white elf quirked the corner of her mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only Hogni knew that this was a real smile that he hardly ever showed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You go south. Find a way to take care of Allen. It's too much of a burden to rely on just those guys." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Got it. ...... So what are you going to do, Hedin?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin took out the panacea from his pocket and pushed it over, then picked up the glasses that had fallen to the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  two  turned  their  backs  to  each  other,  and  Hedin  looked  in  the  direction  of </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Northwest』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go and get rid of the biggest obstacle." </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Chloe, go and support Anya!!! Hurry up!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"East of the main battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of the graves of the Tough Warrior, the Battle Whore, and the four Gulliver brothers, the voices of Runoa and the others rang out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only enemy left was the [Goddess Chariot]. Anya was still holding on, but was also gradually suppressed. Even if the enemy's ability had dropped, it could still be said  to  be  a  miracle  that  they  could  hold  up  to  this  extent  with  Lv.  6  as  their opponent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa and the girls were about to go to Anya's side, and just then - a gun tip was thrown over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Woohoo!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What meow!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa and the others jumped backwards and were shocked to see a throw that blew themselves to pieces where they had been a second ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What was stuck there was a half-broken lance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one that came out of the throw was a villain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't even think about it. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfrigg stood up with his body that he couldn't understand why he could still move. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p311"></a>The  armor  was  sliced  open  by  Aisha's  chopping  wave  along  with  the  hilt  of  the lance, and a deep scar was carved vertically from the right chest, and the battle suit was stained with a red laceration. The helmet was also partially dislodged, and the  left  eye,  which  was  narrowed  by  the  dripping  blood,  was  faintly  visible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Combined with his petite body, he now looks like a broken tinned toy soldier. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the last of the [Inferno Gold Four Warriors] was standing there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You ......! How come you're not dead yet! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was almost like an immortal body, and just when Aisha didn't know what to say, Runoa and the others moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stay out of the way! Just lie down!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You've got a big life! Meow to send you meow on your way meow!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although he was already half dead, he couldn't expose his back to the first level adventurers, so Runoa swung her fists and pounced, and Chloe, who was saying the classic line of the villain, followed her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The unarmed Alfrigg, on the other hand, reached out to his brothers' weapons that were stuck in the ground like tombstones. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, like a thunderclap, he swung the great sword in his right hand as well as the great ax in his left hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blow that almost killed him made Runoa's eyes widen, and Chloe's composure disappeared instantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of Familiaging resonated all around as the two blocked the attack with their gloves and daggers, and their bodies were knocked backwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Two!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This guy--!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Almost as soon as Naza spoke, Aisha slashed through. Mikoto also drew his long sword, "Spring Shrapnel". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa and Chloe, whose faces changed dramatically, also immediately stood up and ran. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The adventurers threw away their carelessness and swarmed to bring him another defeat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't even think about going over ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it could not be defeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hugh past ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only that, he even swung back two humans with his great sword and pushed back the female warrior and catman with his great ax. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「-Never let you pass!!! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p312"></a>Even if they were slashed in the back and stabbed through the shoulder, the prum would never fall down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As long as we are still here, we will never let you go to Freya-sama! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfrigg let out a roar like an oath and transformed into a blood-covered Shura. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His vision was blurred. I don't know if I'm conscious or not. Like an undead spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, now, he was able to exert an amazing explosive power that would leave Aisha and the girls speechless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">('Quadruplet's obsession-) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with this strange sight, Lily, who was lying on the ground, saw it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind Alfrigg there was the phantom of the brothers who should have fallen to the ground - Duvalin, Berling and Grer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holding their brothers' weapons, they who kept fighting were still the [Inferno Gold Four Warriors]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bearing the abnormal magic, lost the infinite connection, the first level adventurer reached  this  high  wall  but  was  still  blocked  in  front  of  them,  making  their  faces become pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... is almost done! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We have to go to Syr's! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The prum who kept attacking maid Chloe and Runoa couldn't stand it anymore and couldn't help but shout. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  next  moment,  as  if  that  "name"  had  triggered  a  switch,  Alfrigg's  anger exploded instantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you kidding me? What a "Syr"! What a "girl"! --That's the goddess (Freya), my lord! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alfrigg, who was furious, overpowered Runoa and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That goddess will always be a goddess! She won't be reduced to a mere street girl! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you saying to yourself? Syr has always been with us!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even if it's the goddess's whim, it's Syr's own wish! What you're talking about is all 'selfishness'! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa and Chloe's retorts struck with fists and daggers, but could not shake his will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even if that's the case! If it's always a 『girl』, she'll get hurt!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She, too, is grieving now! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the words that burst out from Alfrigg. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p313"></a>Hearing the words of the "subordinate" who sensed the thoughts of her master, Runoa and Chloe were speechless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If she were a "goddess", she would not have been hurt! No matter how cruel she is, no matter how many times she does something cruel, she is still the absolute queen! And a 'goddess' doesn't shed tears! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aisha and Mikoto and Naza also stopped moving and listened in a daze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But if you're a 'girl', you'll get hurt easily! After all, that's how women are! That's how it is in the lower world!!! If it wasn't a goddess, that lord would simply break down!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without the defense that protects her body and the armor that protects her from reason, Alfrigg spits out the thoughts hidden in her mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell he ...... guy he! He'll definitely hurt that lord! You are not the same! He will definitely compel that lord and finally give her grief! If that's the case, then we! I hope that she is a "goddess"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the naked sincerity of Alfrigg and his three brothers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fierce emotions of the rage broke the lock of the heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those eyes lost the boundary between the present and the past and reflected the color of regret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We have defiled that lord ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deep in the helmets of the younger brothers who had fallen around them, a line of tears flowed at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Because of us, that lord has been defiled! </p>
<p class="calibre1">--There were once four little humanoids. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Born in an industrial city, the four brothers were very talented jewelry makers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a very common story. Greedy people would surround the ignorant talent to </p>
<p class="calibre1">'squeeze'. The four brothers, who are at the beck and call of the boss (the dwarf) who  introduces  them  to  the  work,  have  no  desire  and  are  basically  unaware  of what lies beyond the cave where they are kept. They didn't even notice that they were being driven at will and got a pay that was not even equal. And the goddess appeared in front of them like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'I want your jewelry. Can you make one for me?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without desire, they were satisfied as long as they could respond to the goddess' </p>
<p class="calibre1">praise, and they made an appointment to present the best jewelry in four days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And four days later, the goddess did not show up. What appeared was the boss (dwarf), saying that he would let them go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The four brothers with crooked heads spoke up and asked. Ask what is going on. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p314"></a>The boss answered them with a nasty smile. He said that as the price for releasing them, he slept with the goddess for four nights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What happened was simple. The goddess wanted the four brothers to get rid of the bad situation and went to deal with the boss (dwarf), whose request was the goddess  herself.  She  did  not  use  her  nasty  'charm'  to  forcefully  snatch  away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because she had to pay the 'price' that was equal to the four brothers, otherwise she would have fallen to the same level as the boss. The goddess was so aware of what value the souls of the four brothers had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After knowing everything, the four brothers brutally killed the boss. They dragged him into the cave and let their anger rule their bodies, beating him with hammers or other tools. Afterwards, the goddess appeared, and they howled as they were stained red by the spilled blood, while apologizing to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was a good deal to spend a night with a boring man to get you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess first showed a sad expression, and finally smiled slightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said, "The jewelry I want (Brishika) is yours. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The 'love' of the goddess was given equally to the four, even at the cost of staining herself with filth. Thus the four brothers offered their loyalty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And this salvation also became a 'sin' that the four brothers carried for the rest of their lives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if the goddess said not to care, they will always curse themselves in this life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then made a vow to get rid of anyone who hated the Goddess, anyone who defiled or hurt her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Whether the Goddess wishes it or not. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if the Goddess chastises them for this, the four Gulliver brothers will always guard 『her』 body and mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All for the sake of the goddess's devotion and 'atonement'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How  could  they  let  her  be  defiled  again!  How  is  it  possible  to  let  her  be  hurt again!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  purely  compulsive  concept.  The  positive  and  negative  sides  of  unwavering loyalty. This was the motivation that drove Alfrigg and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They had always hated themselves very much. Then with an even stronger feeling than that, they kept praying for the goddess to be safe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a line of red tears running down his left eye, Alfrigg cried out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why must you be like a little girl - why must you get hurt! </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the cry of the one who knows regret. This is the cry of one who prays for repentance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p315"></a>This is the thought of the goddess (Freya), which is no less than that of the maiden who misses the girl (Syr). </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was impossible to fight back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa and the girls could not defeat the prum who were in front of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  adventurers  were  forced  to  deal  with  "Obsession  and  Oath"  as  they  were stopped by the "Four prum". </p>

<p class="calibre1">"What are you doing, Chronicler! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Meow, ah ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa and others couldn't come to support, and there was only a battlefield of two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two guns crossed countless times and kept accelerating, while only the golden gun moaned in pain in front of the silver gun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm saying don't get in my way! But why are you still here!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oooh ...... meowga ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can't you even understand the words! What the hell are you going to do to make me angry? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Abusive words also flew in from time to time during the battle, dealing a heavy blow to Anya. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Annoyance combined with extreme anger caused the lance to dance wildly. And because of this, Anya has survived until now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Allen had been even a little more calm, even under the influence of abnormal magic, Anya alone would have been killed in seconds. You can see what kind of anger the elder brother has become at the moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya gritted her teeth and added her words to the gun she stabbed out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Already, said meow ...... Brother-sama! Meow wants to help Syr!!! Just like when I was little, I always helped meow - Brother-sama!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen violently glared his eyes to the limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gunshot that was then used did not allow Anya to make any defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't remind me of that hateful stain!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to overwrite the memory of the past, the sure shot came to Anya's eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blow that would have penetrated her right shoulder no matter how hard she struggled made her face distort bitterly, and at that very moment </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Count me in." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black shadow plunged in, and the black slash bounced off the approaching silver lance. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p316"></a>With a distinct spark, the black elf picked up Anya and disengaged from the spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hogni ......! What do you mean by that! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is said is also ah, is to be angry ah ...... sorry ah, Arun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing Arun's angry hair, Hogni, who should have appeared valiantly, apologized with an expression that half looked like he was going to cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the one who rolled up his eyes was Anya whom he was still holding now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hogni ...... Lord? Why give the meow to ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">【Familia members】During her domicile days, Anya only sought the ties of her older brother and was extremely lacking in communication with other members of the group. At that time, Hogni was already a cadre alternate, and the two did not have any interactions at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wound made his body ache and caused Hogni to wrinkle his face again while he slowly put Anya down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Same as you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I also want to save that lord ...... wants to save『Syr-sama』too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  two  siblings  stared  at  the  same  time,  and  then  Arun's  eyes  turned  into  the shape of karmic fire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hogni, you damn!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, Aron. I'm sorry for being a loser. I'm sorry for being tricked by Hedin!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni, who was at eye level with Allen, did not retort and apologized to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But,  I  think  so!  Syr-sama's  smile  is  honorable!  Trying  to  make  that  lord  keep smiling like that!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  elf  was  a  collection  of  negative  denial  pessimism  (negative),  but  he  still shouted back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, sorry! I ...... will help your sister as well as go to help Bell. I'm betting on these guys with Hedin. In order to make that lord liberated!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  did  not  unleash  his  self-transformation  magic  (Daine  Slew),  but  said  to  his companion  with  the  words  of  his  true  self,  which  is  considered  Hogni's  own awakening.  It  was  the  worthless  etiquette  of  the  elf  who  committed  the  sin  and exposed the disgrace. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This betrayal made Aron's anger, which had long exceeded its limits, become more and more violent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What  is  this  madness!  That  maggot,  and  you  too!  What  "Syr",  what  "girl"!  Isn't everything the whim of that lord! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... is not! Brother, Syr is ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p317"></a>"Shut up! I didn't stay with this farce just to watch you idiots! If I had known this would happen, I really should have put her inside the cage!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen  had  been  acting  as  a  guard  for  『Girl  (Syr)』.  But  he  never  hid  his dissatisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not caring enough to call the goddess' role play a farce, his words and actions had always been very over the top. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I and the chronic over there were saved by the 'Goddess'! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Arun ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The master I admire is a "goddess"! Not a 'girl'! </p>
<p class="calibre1">--There were two cats. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A sister who depends on her brother. The brother who was annoyed with her and still hates her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  and  she  were  dependent  on  each  other,  and  in  this  world  of  only  two,  the goddess appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess brings salvation and the struggle every day. The brother takes the initiative and throws himself into the struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The younger sister is timid and afraid, while desperately chasing after the back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually the sister is abandoned, thinking sadly: the brother has been snatched away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the brother who abandoned the sister... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I worked for the goddess because I was promised "power"! I hope that you will always be the absolute goddess who can make me strong! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're saying she's not a goddess anymore? You're kidding, I won't allow it. I don't agree with any little girl!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if he couldn't forgive the existence of the goddess who had degraded her into a girl in front of him, Aron jumped up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At Hogni and Anya who were posing, he struck out his fierce mood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The one who took away my heart is the 『Goddess』 who is arrogant, cold, and more powerful than anyone else!!!" </p>

<p class="calibre1">--There was once a male. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The male was an abandoned child. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The oldest memories are of freezing cold that seemed to burn his skin, and of dark nights that were merciless and vicious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was too young to realize the fact that he was very "lonely" and was about to end up in a lonely alley. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p318"></a>"You, alone? </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the goddess appeared here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  fierce  darkness  was  dispelled,  and  a  silvery  glow  like  a  halo  came  into  his vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  silvery  light,  the  consciousness  of  a  young  child,  who  had  not  yet established himself, sprouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is his name? I couldn't answer this question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then, I will give you one." She smiled, but he couldn't nod either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For him, who did not even know himself, the goddess who picked him up was the whole world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was everything to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your name is Ottarh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">So from that day on, the male became the fierce one (Ottar)... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dwarf's blow hit the black sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Flame Volt]!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  star  sword  swung  by  the  elf  and  the  inflammatory  thunder  released  by  the rabbit were subdued with one hand swing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia and the others attacked in turn, and Ottar caught them all and returned them immediately afterwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The men had no words that should be spoken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Men only know to go to battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Ottar, there is no difference between the past, which is the origin of himself, and the present, which unfolds in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--why do you (you) want to fight? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one asked him that, and he never asked himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was not even a doubt about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, it was simple. That's all Ottar could do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cold and mute, he could not make 'her' who gave him everything smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, it was power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only by being strong could he repay the goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar could only prove himself by fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  through  fighting  -  can  he  ask  whether  he  is  right  or  wrong,  right  or  wrong, even good or bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"呶嗯!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p319"></a>"" "!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Orta conducts a test. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Orta makes an inquiry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Orta confirms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What can you do for the goddess who is everything to him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can you forcibly achieve such beautiful words as rescue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black greatsword that swung down broke the stone slab and the earth Bellow, blowing Mia, Ryu and Bell away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a blow of his own, he launched an inquiry to the three souls that the goddess had fallen in love with at first sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(And then, if you can't win against me--) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just die here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you can't transcend this body, you are not qualified to save『Goddess』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not to mention saving the girl. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It is something that OTA would recognize. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's not fiction, it's not a dream, and it's not sophistry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is "power". </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  you  cannot  demonstrate  power,  then  the  victory  of  the  Goddess  will  not  be shaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strongest warriors who remained on the battlefield shouted their will and made their vows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All were not wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were only thinking of the goddess, or following their own beliefs by carrying out their own selfish desires. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To save her, to protect her, to bind her, and to repay her, the familia members of the Goddess of Beauty became fierce and violent. </p>




<p class="calibre1">"Supporters...! I, the Goddess of Victory, am coming! This will make you stronger! </p>
<p class="calibre1">You're getting beaten up like a raggedy rat! </p>
<p class="calibre1">So noisy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I heard the voice of the young goddess who was running towards me in a panic and was making a lot of noise from the beginning to the end, the forehead of Lily who was still on the ground burst out with veins. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p320"></a>"Are you still alive, supporter-kun? Where is the healing? The first thing you need to do is to get a new one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Props or something, there is no need ...... instead of treating the less able to fight Lily, first treat the life of the Lord they ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing you need to do is to get your hands on Hestia's hand and finally get up, sweating furiously down her forehead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The left arm was brutally destroyed as the center, the wound covered Lily's whole body,  see  Hestia  sucked  in  a  breath.  She  opened  her  mouth  to  say  something when the commander's eyes looked over, so she swallowed her words with a jerk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After doing the emergency treatment as far as she could, she knocked down her plump breasts with her fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As I said earlier, I've come to strengthen you! Come on, show your backside! And Mikoto and the girls, too, I'll update [Ability Value] together..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No need! Why did you come to this place? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait a minute! Don't deny my efforts to come all the way here! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia's eyes widened as she was immediately told in a frothy voice that it wasn't necessary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the corner of the field of vision, Miachi shouted "Naza! Miek, who was hugging his  familia  members,  and  Naza,  who  was  calling  "Miek-sama!  The  difference between her own eyes and those of the gods was that she was hugging him with moist  eyes.  In  order  not  to  expose  the  skin  of  the  dependents  to  the  'mirror', </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Miachyuk's dependents] began to update their [ability value] in the shadows, while the  bumpy  young  girl  group  of  [Hestia's  dependents]  was  shouting  in  an  ugly manner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lili-sama! Hestia-sama!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, Haruhime, who couldn't directly participate in the battle, staggered over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing her figure, Lily put away the eye crystal that she was just about to take out, as if to say that this saved her time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hestia-sama, Haruhime-sama! Please go get Bell-sama!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She endured the pain and began to explain to the surprised two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lily, we'll try to fix this place! Hestia-sama, you go to the northwest side, to Bell-sama and the others! In the final analysis, as long as we can't solve the [Fierce One], we can't win this war game! </p>
<p class="calibre1">This side of the 『main battlefield』 can't be said to have sufficient battle power either. With Alfrigg, who hadn't fallen, and [Goddess Chariot] as opponents, there must be no carelessness. However, the unexpected participation of [Black Demon </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p321"></a>Sword] has increased the possibility of a stalemate. I'm afraid this was the enemy commander's (Hedin) idea. He was looking at the 『same sight』 with Lili. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Ottar was still alive, everything would be in vain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if Lily and the girls defeated Allen and the others and broke into the Queen (Freya), Ottar would definitely swat away Bell and the others to intervene in it. As long as 『Vertex』 still guarded the throne, the allied forces of the faction valve would not get victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, this extremely limited battle power (resources) can only be invested in the war against the [Fierce]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haruhime-sama,  is  [Nine  Heavy]  still  available!  What  about  the  simultaneous reinforcement of three, no to four people! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"---! ............ can. It will definitely be done! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then, please go and apply the level up for Ryu-sama and the girls! Hestia-sama, please go and update Bell-sama's ability! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Supporters. Is that what you were planning to do from the beginning ......? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So that's what Lily was saying! If you want to increase your power dramatically, the one who can do it best is Lord Bell! Please don't mind Lily let's ...... go over there!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She secretly tapped out [One Heart Longing] to avoid being noticed by the urban side who was watching the 『Mirror』 broadcast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm afraid that Lv. 2 Lilly, Mikoto and Haruhime's ability value's enhancement will not  exceed  100  combined,  instead  of  strengthening  them,  it  would  be  better  to super strengthen Lv. 5 Bell, which would bring meaning to the battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia looked at Lily, who was panting and bleeding to explain, and finally made up her mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Let's go, Haruhime-kun! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a ruthless heart, she turned her back on the badly wounded Lily, and the still fighting Mikoto girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  she  left  the  command  of  this  place  to  Lily  and  Miach  and  ran  desperately towards the northwest side of the island, the 'amphitheater'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaa, haaa, haaaaa ......! Damn, I've been running around today ~~~~! </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, she was running too slowly. She didn't get very far at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In itself, for the gods whose physical abilities were not as good as normal people, coming from the eastern domain of the urban ruins to the 『main battlefield』 near the  westernmost  part  of  the  island  was  a  big  move.  Even  those  who  were  not particularly slow-footed like Hestia would feel very tired. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p322"></a>Plus, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haruhime-kun!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The familia member's knees suddenly went weak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she saw Haruhime's hands holding the ground, she hurriedly stopped and turned back, only to see her emerald green pupils wide open and her entire body breathing.  The  sweat  is  also  abnormally  high,  a  lot  of  sweat  dripping  down  the watery skin, hitting the stone floor of the ruins to form countless spots. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haruhime-kun, it's true that your body and mind have also been ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously is the harbinger of mental fatigue cons. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The answer to Lily's words is just a strong spirit, no, should be called for the sake of companionship pulverized consciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haruhime has no more power left to use the chanting link (nine). Perhaps not even reach Bell and them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia put her hand on the back of the young girl, distressed at nothing, and just then </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... No, it's not! Haruhime can still stand up! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haru, Haru-hime... uh, woo-woo! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can even run with Hestia-sama in my arms like this!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haruhime actually forced herself to pick up Hestia horizontally and stand up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With her dazzling blonde hair shaking and large drops of sweat flying everywhere, she ran with extreme stubbornness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chun, Haruhime-kun, are you okay? I'm not going to be heavy! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm already Lv. 2! The weight of Hestia-sama is nothing to worry about! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who do you call the incarnation of a heavy fat mass (Opie)? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  front  of  Haruhime's  eyes,  the  bosom  bounced  and  changed  its  shape  in  an intrusive  manner,  and  together  with  the  young  goddess,  she  let  out  a  voice  of protest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unable to think properly, Haruhime completed the conversion of weight (Opie) = </p>
<p class="calibre1">Goddess (Hestia) and ran. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  the  thought  in  her  mind  that  she  too  must  cross  the  limit  like  Mikoto  and Sharmila and others, she ran towards the northwest side of the island. </p>





<p class="calibre1"><a id="p323"></a> </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Taaaaaaah!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dwarf struck with his full strength and swung his big black sword to meet the blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whew!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The human released a double sword slash that bounced off with all the hand armor on one side, rendering it ineffective. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Starlight Wind]!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the elfs used them as bait to launch a barrage of seventy-two shots of great light jade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's too mild." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even this was knocked down with the knot formed by the Great Chopper, and the last shot was grabbed with the right hand and crushed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">""---?"" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Always defending. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not Nuito's attack, but Nuito's 『defense』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia, Bell, and Ryu, all three together, were still unable to break his guard. He drove the blackened great sword and strong limbs, becoming a symbol of great fortitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All three of them showed their surprise, but Ottar's expression didn't change as he dismantled the various attacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'Absolute defense'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">People always used to focus on the crushing attacks of Taketo (Ottar), but in fact, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"defense" was his real skill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His feet and waist are like a tree that doesn't move, his "skill" to respond to any attack in m (millimeter), and his eyes that  see through his opponent's "strategy" </p>
<p class="calibre1">like predicting the future. With the unusually high "durability" ability value, he is like a divine shield that resists all attacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He didn't need the strengthening of "magic" nor the increase of "skill". </p>
<p class="calibre1">What he used was pure 'age itself'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just the flesh that was constantly exercised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crystallization of "skill" and "strategy" that was ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the scenario that [Fierce One] finally arrived at. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Can't defeat him ......!?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">(There are no dead ends at all! Not a single one!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p324"></a>The proof is that Ottar arguably never left the center of the amphitheater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Goddess Festival was knocked out by a blow to Bell and Ryu comprehended a point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So far, Ottar is not even in a 'battle' with them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(This brat ......! How hard has he been working out since then!!!) Mia, who was the only one qualified to fight [Fierce One] head-on, also cursed and noticed something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  she  retired  from  the  group,  Ottar's  workout  both  in  intensity  and  time  was even more than before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While following the goddess (Freya) as an attendant, at the same time he never slacked off and kept delving in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Role-playing - after the girl (Syr) left early in the morning for the tavern, he spent all the rest of his time on self-training. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottarh no longer will go to the battle wilderness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because no one is his opponent. Even Allen and others who are forbidden to fight are not enough to pose a threat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar has not been to the dungeon for a long time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mere exploration could only raise the ability value a little, and he knew that today's </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Vessel』 had reached its limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar is 『the strongest』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no one else in the labyrinth city (Orario) who could make him stronger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, Ottar was immersed in his own heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Alone, he wielded his sword, recalling his former strongest enemy in his mind, and every  day,  he  just  cultivated  "skill"  and  "strategy".  Before  the  Lord  God  gave permission to challenge the 『trial』 that bets on his life, all as an even somewhat dull 『martial artist』, grinding himself to the limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Here is the difference between him and the slayer, [Kenshi], who was beating down monsters in the maze one after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Absolute defense (that) ...... we couldn't break either." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well ......! Even if we all go together, we can not succeed!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the base 『Dusk House』, the sister (Tiona) nodded her head with a ragged breath and affirmed her sister (Tione) who was staring at the 『Mirror』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The [Loki Familia] had fought many times with the head of the rival faction valve (Ottar). Even they had not been able to break through the guardianship of [Fierce One]. Ai Si once also relied on Tiona and the girls to help, only to easily avoid the chase of him who crossed in front. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p325"></a>The blonde-haired, blonde-eyed girl sat on the bench and clenched her fist on her knee, while her pupils twitched from the "cruelty" of having to have three people break through the "absolute defense". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is already going to be ah." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Finn." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ahhh, Gareth, Riveria. I know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gareth whispered softly as he watched with bated breath aside from Ace and the girls, and Rivelia narrowed her eyes as Finn nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Sure enough, Orta is already very close to Lv. 8--) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that this was too desperate for Bell and the others was coldly seen through by Brave's eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lv. 7 that was infinitely close to Lv. 8. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the top of the top of the male gods (Zeus) and goddesses (Hera) will reach the strongest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The brave man agreed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gods conclude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one can be compared with [the fierce one]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is true that he is the 'pinnacle' of adventurers. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Therefore, what was ushered in was bound to be a vicious and bitter battle with a bitter realm of disadvantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  launching  the  attack  was  bounced  off,  and  then  launched  the  sword counterattack so that Mia suffered more and more damage, and the frequency was more and more high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell they can barely resist - can become a battle this form, thanks to Mia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The absolute front guard who can fight head to head with Ottar, the front guard shield job Mia if they fall, they will immediately defeat. Ryu and Bell both valued the 『agility』 fighting style. Although good at high-speed combat, he can not fight against  the  strength  and  defense  specialization  of  Ottar.  No  matter  how  many times  they  disengaged  with  a  single  strike,  no  matter  how  they  disrupted  each other, as long as the attack could not penetrate the enemy's "defense", they would not have any chance of winning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu and Bell sweat spurted out in abundance and sped around, supporting Mia so she wouldn't fall down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  adventurers  fought  with  all  their  might,  using  the  tenacious  dwarves  as  a starting point, and biting into each other no matter what. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p326"></a>Then,  as  if  agreeing  with  their  best  efforts  to  fight,  the  pigman『Wujin』recited </p>
<p class="calibre1">『that』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Mercy of the Silver Moon, Wilderness of Gold]--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chanting resounded all around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The plaintive tone reached his ears, and Ryu was the first to show his surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Parallel Chanting"? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's not it exactly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar is not as good at chanting as Hedin and Hogni, the first level elfs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Nor does Ryu have the ability to perform all four acts of attack, movement, evasion and chanting at the same time in a real battle like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He only limited the actions that include chanting to "two" like the order in the last war game (Apollo's familia war). If it is a short chant then the time needed to control it will be very short, and even the non-magical profession of Ottar can break the trick with power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only difference with Mikoto is that he didn't move in the "two" actions including chanting - he chose "defense" instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With his left foot firmly pinned to the ground with his center of gravity, he combined </p>
<p class="calibre1">『absolute defense』 with chanting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That magic is ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Golden Boar's Fur (Hildis Vini). </p>
<p class="calibre1">A pure strengthening magic, a『Absolute Strike』that was enough to counteract a strike with Bell's maximum stored power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenager trembled. The dwarf's face was crooked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together with the elf driven by anxiety, the three lunged from three directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stop him, you two!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Would not stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was like a wall that transcended heavenly justice, and all of them bounced back whether it was a chopping blow or a painful beating or an inflammatory thunder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I hereby take orders, this body is the fierce pig of war (king)" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottarh would never shy away from using it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He wouldn't be foolish to proudly think that his only magic was a "sure kill" or a </p>
<p class="calibre1">"killer" and keep it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's just that in most cases, even if he doesn't use his mental power consumption - </p>
<p class="calibre1">a magic that consumes a lot of energy - he can rely on his wrist power to suppress the enemy, resulting in not being able to use it normally. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, when it's time to use it, it will be used. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Not to mention attacking - can't even stop chanting?!) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p327"></a>Ottar can use "magic", which means that the opponent can't be defeated by his strange power and "absolute defense" alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, it was a great honor just to make [Fierce] use "magic". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, Bell could feel proud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because he made Ottar use "magic" twice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, Bell could feel despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a declaration of absolute death sentence without any doubt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gu-? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was only possible for Mia to step forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though she knew that the chant that was nearing completion was a『bait』</p>
<p class="calibre1">dangling in front of her eyes, if she didn't stop the spell, the bomb called『magic』</p>
<p class="calibre1">would explode. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She knew very well that she was being lured by the enemy to lunge at『Strategy』</p>
<p class="calibre1">and launch an attack like a death sentence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--Too weak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with Mia's full strength strike to destroy the defense, Ottar pointed out a fact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The 【Fierce One】's 『defense』 is also the meaning of 『attack』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  lacquered  black  greatsword  that  was  swung  down  collided  with  the  giant shovel, and instead of biting each other, it forcibly cleaved each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kah..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mia-san! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mia-chan!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chopping flash overpowered the shovel and carved a slash on Mia's body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blood erupted from her body as Ottar delivered another relentless front kick. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia  barely  blocked  it,  at  which  point  he  took  aim  at  the  staggering  Mia  again, resting the hand clutching the hilt along with the greatsword on his right shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The steel-like deltoid and oblique muscles bulged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next instant, as if a cannon was fired, he thrust the great sword forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"----! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the blow that was going to pierce Mia, Bell jumped up with a speed that was enough to reverse time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Heroic Wish (Skill)] was activated. A mere half second of stored power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  particles  of  light  gathered  in  the  right  foot,  kicked  the  ground  and  thrust between Mia and Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Facing  the  large,  pitch-black  sword  that  thrust  forward  with  a  roar,  he  set  up Hestia's Blade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The left hand held the hilt of the blade and the right hand held the face of the blade. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p328"></a>The  dagger  blade  face  that  both  hands  resisted  accurately  blocked  the  sword protrusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Blade of God would not shatter. But it emits a sad cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword protrusion pushed the dagger together into the abdomen, causing Bell to spit out an exaggerated amount of blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo--!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenager became a cushion, but Mia was still painfully beaten by the violent impact and flew backwards after catching the teenager's body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Carrying the divine will of the goddess, bravely going forward]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Of course, a relentless pursuit ensued. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The final chant was sung. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar was going to smash the enemy with her native 『magic』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[[Hildis Vini]] </p>
<p class="calibre1">Radiance was born. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  pitch-black  great  sword  wrapped  around  the  golden  fur  that  was indistinguishable from Bell's memory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aiming at Mia who slammed into the north wall of the theater, Ottar swung down the golden blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If they fall down - that's the end of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Hildis-Viney] is a pure 『Strengthening Magic』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  wasn't  even  considered  to  be  empowering  magic,  and  it  didn't  have  a  way  to attack enemies from a distance by itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, what would it be like if you combined the attribute of pure strengthening of 『Power』 with the freak-like arm strength? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The answer is - a chop that swings can strangle the distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「「------」」 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A golden chopping light that far surpasses the chopping wave (Hel-Kaios) of the female warrior (Aisha). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Space was simply sliced open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The vision of Bell and Mia, who were covered in blood, was tinted with a glow that seemed like the color of dusk. </p>

<p class="calibre1">At that moment Ryu flew over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She came in the name of the wind, picked up Bell and Mia, and tried her best to get away. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p329"></a>A moment after the shadows that overlapped together escaped out of range, the sound of decimation boomed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~! </p>
<p class="calibre1">A strong impact and sound wave came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">These beat Ryu and the others, causing them to hit the ground several times and roll around on the floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Van, who was immobilized by the shaking of the entire amphitheater, also let out a scream that was not audible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound immediately disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no aftermath left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  purely  destructive  blow  does  not  cause  secondary  damage  like  high  level magic, but simply blows away everything that is there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sh ........................" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Raising his head, Bell, bracing his body, Mia and Ryu were dumbfounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  north  corner,  the  walls,  columns,  and  hill-like  height  of  the  audience  all disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The decapitation destroyed the theater itself, and even penetrated the urban ruins on the outside, as well as the edge part of the ruins deep enough to reach beyond the island. The beautiful emerald green lake - the view of the huge depression lake came into view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Not as beautiful as Leon made it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The low murmur that fell from the  mouth  of the martial artist  disappeared into a wave-like sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Along the trajectory  of the chop was  sliced through the surface of the lake, and gradually returned to its original state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell and others were too frightened to move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Van, who was lying on the south side of the audience and was not hurt, was also pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The city residents who saw everything through the "mirror" also froze in place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the "golden fur" still had not disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The second blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  lacquered  black  sword,  still  wrapped  in  the  golden  light,  was  swung  down mercilessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if replaying the previous scene, the mega-slash light was released. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--It was over. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p330"></a>Seeing the approaching finality, Bell, Ryu, and even Mia thought so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eternal Conquest, Immortal Thunder General" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Reimu's spell that cut off the end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Varian Hild" </p>
<p class="calibre1">An extremely large thunderbolt was released. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's  not  an  infinite  number  of  projectiles,  but  a  『Great  Cannon  Strike』  that  is concentrated in one place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The giant lightning flash that would even swallow the "Floor Master" approached from the east and hit the side of the chopping light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bright splash (flash) erupted in front of Bell and others, and immediately after, the direction of advance of gold changed from northeast to northwest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The northwest side of the building was also eliminated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, the nine dead Bells and others snapped their heads back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just changing the direction, how much spiritual power is it going to take away from me? You are an unconscionable incarnation." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  white  elf  blandly  walked  down  from  the  shelling  site,  the  east  side  of  the audience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One hand held a long-handled knife, bored with adjusting the position of crooked glasses, Hedin Selander. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ Master? Why! No, does that mean ............ you really?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't put on that stupid face that invites people, stupid rabbit. I should have found out from the moment I saved you, stupid." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because he had been suffering from Ottar's 『baptism』, Bell didn't know about Hedin's 『betrayal』, and for a moment he wondered if he was mistaken, and then recalled the 『premonition』 he had said to Lily before the battle started, and his face was colored with surprise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although Hedin looked over like something dirty, causing Bell's face to twitch ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">but still with the Bellated joy, a clumsy smile emerged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  he  was  not  the  『cold  other  (Hedin  Selander)』  who  had  abused  『Bell Familia of [Freya]』, but the 『Master』 who had inflicted a lot of modifications on himself in front of 『Boxing』, and Bell clearly understood that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  it  wasn't  for  this  situation,  the  teenager  would  have  shed  a  line  of  tears,  and seeing  this  kind  of  teenager's  smile,  Hedin  really  still  snorted  unpleasantly  and said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Obviously you are there, how can it be so miserable, Mia." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... You're still annoying. I have a blank period." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p331"></a>"Then fill it in quickly. If you're still asleep, you and I will only be crushed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin, who also threw a scolding at Mia, came down from the audience and threw out two vials. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the last prop. Mia first used to plug the body wound, and then poured half of  the  remaining  upper  level  recovery  medicine  and  upper  level  mental  power recovery medicine directly on the heads of Bell and Ryu. After being surprised and probably realizing that there was no use in refuting, the recovered Bells and others staggered to their feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hedin ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't need to explain it to you, Ottar." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ahhh." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The attack of his own was obstructed by the warlord (Hedin), and even fell to the enemy, but Ottar didn't look the least bit shaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He put his black sword, which had lost its magic effect, on his shoulder and looked at the elf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Answer me a question." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What question?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How much do you know?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning his back on Bell, who had risen to her feet, Hedin, who was confronting Ottar, asked indifferently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To temper this stupid rabbit, I did something. Instigated Hogni and the others and had them strike him to the point of near death. To make him as handy as possible." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eh?  Bell  forgot  how  moved  he  had  just  been  and  turned  into  a  stone  statue,  at which point Hedin asked again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But, only you refused my instructions." </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was after the Goddess' (Freya's) 『Boxing』 began to produce cracks and he deliberately intensified 『Baptism』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin refuted the others and proposed that Bell should be forced into a desperate situation immediately, wanting all the cadres to join 『Baptism』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--『Ottar, you do the same. Beat that stupid rabbit with your rigid sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--- "There's no need to include me. Hedin, I'll leave it to you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But only Ottar said so, firmly refusing him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At that time, did you already guess that I would betray and 'become like this'? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin  had  been  active  in  the  shadows,  and  even  the  goddess  (Freya)  had  not noticed this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But only the martial artist in front of him pulled away as if he had sensed it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Hedin's question, Ottar's expression rippled as he answered. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p332"></a>"...... I am not as smart as you. There is no way to know what will happen." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this point, the rust-colored eyes stared closely at Hedin, as well as Bell, who was standing diagonally behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But, at that time, I saw 『the picture. ...... The 『image』 of you two standing in front of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just like the sight in front of him, he concluded thus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin crooked up his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stop surpassing strategy based on feelings alone, you battle fool." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  smacked  his  tongue  unpleasantly  when  he  felt  this  instinct  of  InuYasha  that could be called 『martial intuition』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin stared at the being who was the complete opposite of himself who acted on theory, and finally raised his battle spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Have you finished?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ahhh. Now I'll start to destroy you quickly. Or else the troublesome stupid cat will be coming after us." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  if  it  was  time  to  end  the  question  and  answer  session,  Hedin  gathered  his mental energy and shifted to a battle-ready state. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's when Bell called him back in a panic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Master, Master? Are you going to fight with us! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is there any other option in this situation, punk. Don't talk." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... We are completely helpless. Do you have a plan to fight against that [fierce man]?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'd  like  to  ask  you  why  you're  not  prepared.  What's  the  point  of  fighting  a  real monster head-on? Make a plan for me. Think of all the ways. Are you going to face the Floor Master head-on? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He casually dealt with the sullen Bell, and also humiliated Ryu's next question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin didn't even look at them, implying that this battle was the same as the battle against the 'Labyrinth Lone King'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mia, I'll be the 'rear guard'. You take the stupid rabbits over there and go around a bit more." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... We can't immediately follow your command for any serious link-ups, can we? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There was no expectation of such a thing to begin with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  wise  general's  eyes  were  simply  fixed  on  the  martial  artist  standing  there leisurely and stated his request. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go buy time. Just ten seconds." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the next instant, he released his magic power and announced that the battle had begun again. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p333"></a>"[Eternal Strife, Undying Thunderbolt]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Using the elf's song as an opportunity, Bell and the others rushed out in unison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu, on the other hand, brought along『Parallel Chanting』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And instead of taking a 『passive stance』, Orta showed an 『attack stance』 for the first time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sprinted straight forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhhh!? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't underestimate people! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to say that there was no reason to take the shelling of the defender (Hedin) for nothing, he burst in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell and Ryu were easily bounced aside by the rust-colored pig burst, but Mia was the only one who blocked it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if using her body to prove that the race of strength (Dwarf) is true, she took the pig's impact and dug the bottom of her boot through the completely broken stone slab. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  black  sword  and  the  giant  shovel  bit  together,  maintaining  a  second  of antagonistic time. And within that second, the elf had moved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin, who was thoroughly using Mia as a 『shield』, began to move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  ran  or  jumped  along  the  outside  of  the  theater  stage,  cutting  a  circular trajectory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While moving at high speed, countless lightning bullets were created. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead of immediately firing at the target (Ottar), the thunderbolts stood by on the east, northeast and north sides, fixed in place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing this sight, Ottar's eyes widened for the first time since the battle began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He immediately understood the enemy's intention and swung Mia away vigorously, trying to crush Hedin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Flame Volt]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Saffron Wisp]!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, two flames stopped him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell  released  Inferno  Thunder's  rapid-fire  cannon,  and  Ryu  was  once  again surrounded by flaming petals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The former was a disruption without being able to stop him, while the latter was a strong attack that bred great firepower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without much aiming, the successive shots of Inferno Thunder rolled up bursts of wind and bursts of inflammation obstructing the view, and the bursts of slash that </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p334"></a>approached  from  the  side  forced  Ottar  to  meet  it.  Although  unable  to  break  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Absolute Defense』, the explosive flames still forced the pigman to stop in his tracks. Even if he ignored Bell's barrage and sent Ryu flying, by then Mia would have revived and attacked again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as Mia and the others were resolutely stalking and not letting go, the lightning bombs were fixed in order in the northwest, west side, and southwest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  promised  ten  seconds.  You've  worked  hard,  and  I'm  going  to  give  you something in return. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  finally  completing  the  fixation  on  the  southeast  side,  Hedin  stopped  in  his tracks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ray's 'Surrounding Net'! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the shock of Bell and Ryu who looked around showed, the stage of the theater was now surrounded by countless lightning bombs floating in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Using the "standby state" of magic to set "bombs". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Using his Lv. 6 ability, especially his excellent magic control, Hedin maintained and configured  the  lightning  bombs  in  the  places  he  moved  to.  Even  Ryu  who  had reached the same ability couldn't do such a thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dome shaped arrangement of magic bullets was like a fierce starry sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was also a "prison" for the fierce boars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The total number of fixed lightning bombs, nine hundred and seventy-eight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  the  arrow  clusters  aiming  at  himself  without  exception,  Ottar's  eyes narrowed as he looked around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Feel free to make a fuss, avant-garde. --After that, I'll cooperate with you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  adventurers  understood  Hedin's  "instructions"  by  intuition  and  instinct,  and rushed forward as he asked them to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell ran ahead and slashed from the side with his dagger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar took the "absolute defense" stance and was about to give him a heroic death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Up to this point, it was the same as the previous attack and defense. What was different was the direction after that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sanno no Hyou (þrír). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lightning bombs set up on the east side were fired at the same time as Bell touched the enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「！？" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar was taken aback. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p335"></a>In a completely different direction from the teenager's surprise attack, three magic bullets approached from behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  quickly  twisted  his  arms  and  upper  body,  which  were  intended  to  meet  the teenager, to correct his posture to avoid the attack, but at that moment, the long-prepared "Hestia's Blade" showed its fangs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fierce sound of metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  backhanded  grip  of  the  chop,  the  pigman  raised  his  left  wrist  in  the  nick  of time, and the hand armor covering it blocked it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">(It was defended! But - it worked!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell's own eyes widened, and his back trembled from the solid feel of his hand for the first time today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following  the  policy  of  disengaging  with  one  blow,  he  quickly  retreated  before receiving Ottar's counterattack. He was replaced by Ryu,  who was approaching rapidly  from  the  exact  opposite  direction.  She  fell  her  body  as  far  forward  as possible, and swiftly and sharply swung her inflammatory sword from the very low bottom, in the dead center of Ottar's vision, whose height exceeded 2M. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  clever  dodge  was  also  immediately  responded  to  by  Ottar  with  inhuman speed, however </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the "Soldier of Seven (sjö)." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time too, a new lightning bullet was shot from the southwest side of his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to say that he would not be fooled twice by the same technique, the veins emerged  with  a  rigid  wrist,  causing  the  lacquered  black  sword  to  flash  twice, swinging Ryu away with the lightning, however - Mia appeared at that moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look, look, look, look! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment after the blow was struck, there was a gap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The huge shovel was swung at the perfect time, sending the defense and the huge body of the pig man flying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It worked! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's amazing! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  gods  who  saw  the  whole  attack  and  defense  with  their  "mirrors"  could  not contain themselves and made a big noise on the 30th floor of the "Tower of Babel". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the [Fierce One] retreated from the center of the theater, and the result of this battle made both the enemy and the camp extremely excited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is too much! At the exact moment when the front guard attacked, he added what would normally be a sure-kill 'magic' without missing a beat! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p336"></a>"And the number and power were adjusted so that it wouldn't affect Bell and the others! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loki and Hermes, who were watching the battle here, also praised. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The omniscient gods immediately saw through Hedin's anticipated 'strategy'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The establishment of "One-sided linkage"! A temporary team cannot expect to be in  unison!  It  was  the  limit  if  they  could  cooperate  with  each  other!  And  the  rear guard made up for everything in his mind and supported him! </p>
<p class="calibre1">A 'simultaneous attack' with the front guard. This was Hedin's ploy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the farthest position, he saw through the movements of Bell, Ryu and Mia, and  then  freely  operated  the  lightning  arrows  that  unfolded  in  all  directions, matching Bell's attack with theirs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He would not be foolish enough to fire all of the close to a thousand magic bullets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if he was wounded, Ottar's "Complete Defense" was still  able to resist the simultaneous  firing  from  all  directions.  That's  why  it  was  a  『simultaneous attack』. Combining magic bullets with the front guard's excellent attack increases the option of Ottar's『defense』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not necessary to give damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Staggered  timing,  interference  with  concentration,  inconsistency  in  attack  and defense,  all  of  these  accumulate  little  by  little,  and  sooner  or  later,  『complete defense』 will be broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forcing the expansion of "either one or the other". Or make it happen continuously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forcing the sound of thunder (noise) into the "game" between Ottar and Bell and others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just one magic bullet is powerful enough to make a second level adventurer faint. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  attacks  of  the  first  level  adventurers  (Mia)  were  even  more  so.  And  [Fierce One] must counter both! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The tactic of focusing on defense backfired. That white elf, with her pretty face like a girl, is a pure sadist! Of course, it's thanks to the youngsters that they were able to hurt Ottar, thanks to their quick moves ....... Right, Burt!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gee  whiz  ......  with  that  kind  of  defender,  just  about  anyone  can  put  dirt  on  his face." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Next to the shouting Hermes and Loki, Burt was not happy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  did  not  want  to  identify  with  the  rabbit,  so  he  said  so,  but  this  must  mean appreciation of Hedin, making the werewolf even more unpleasant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ottar, this is the [formation] I came up with in order to burn you to death. Because I could not complete the front and rear guard movements by myself at the same time, it was abandoned, but ...... here is just the right place to use it again." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p337"></a>The man who had been staying at the east side of the theater and manipulating magic, Hedin murmured calmly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once  again,  the  relationship  between  the  members  of  the  [Freya  Familia]  is particularly bad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The brutal intra-factional competition where the members of the group clash with each other, and the first rank adventurers are no exception. In order to defeat Ottar, Hedin started developing this lightning formation several years ago, and now it is used here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo...? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tactic of using Ottar as an imaginary enemy was very effective. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lightning bombs that attacked at the same time as Bell and the others seemed to have a will of their own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Ottar had to be distracted by the countless thunder swords and lances, as the "thunder soldiers" led by King (Hedin) launched a wave attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin was very clever. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All-around,  including  the  Thunderbolts  that  unfolded  at  the  head,  he  was sometimes very economical, and sometimes boldly put them in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I thought he would just grab the dead end of Ottar and launch a one-sided snipe from behind, he was dewy again, firing from the left and right of his field of vision as well as from the front, adjusting to hide that real blow and hit directly on top of the giant body. Using Bell's attack as a decoy or as many as thirty rounds of thunderbolts as a feint, precisely calculating the launch angle, bullet speed, and sequence,  not  so  much  to  break  Ottar's  defenses,  but  also  to  keep  his  brain overloaded. In addition, the lightning bombs will cause electrocution when blocked by the blackened greatsword or hand armor, causing the orc's flesh to gradually accumulate real damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In conjunction with the front guard's assault, Hedin, who was manipulating magic at the large rear guard, could be considered the 'commander'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And his long-handled sword, the first level of armament "Disaria" is the command baton. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a long-handled weapon made from the branches of the Great Sacred Tree, and also a 'staff' that increases the magic power of elfs, just like Ryu's 'Elvis Justia'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic gem at the end of the handle glowed, causing the Thunderbolt to cry out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ryu, boy! Let's go! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p338"></a>Bell, Ryu and Mia also gradually adapted to the Thunderbolt's aid, and instead of wheeling  and  dealing,  the  three  of  them  launched  their  attacks  almost simultaneously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, at the moment when Ottar's 『Complete Defense』 wavered, the adventurers struck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「Oh laaaaaaaaaa!!! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia launched a surprise attack from the front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin's call rang out in a distant echo. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tólf of the Twelve! Company (Regios)!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He threw all the lightning bombs located on the north side, raining down on Ottar's back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with a front and back attack, Ottar was even a little stubborn not to choose </p>
<p class="calibre1">『evasion』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Fierce One] was sure that the choice of giving up "Absolute Defense" would be the one that would get him into a desperate situation like being chased by a hound, so he twisted his upper body and birthed "Storm". </p>
<p class="calibre1">A fierce slash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He used the length of the lacquered black sword that was close to his own height (range)  to  sweep  away  Mia,  countless  lightning  bombs,  and  everything  close  to him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia barely blocked it with a giant shovel as a shield and stepped backwards, but her lips turned into the shape of a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia and the large number of lightning bombs that were injected were "decoys". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Parallel to the sky, let the earth be covered with star trails]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Parallel chanting" came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu,  who  had  released  the  flame  petals,  launched  a  burst  and  chanted  the inheritance magic (Astraea Memories) at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  he  had  just  met  the  attack  with  his  whole  body.  Coupled  with  the  gyration stop, there must be a gap created. Ottar's eyes widened at the Blast Shadow that had bullied him close to his arms - yet still responded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nooooooooooooo! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He ignored the inertia and reaction force, causing his tendons to roar with grief, and was about to swing a breaking blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A reaction speed that exceeds that of a normal human. Even beyond the giant's source of strange power. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p339"></a>Ryuon's pupils reflected the black severing blade that was about to swing down, and at that instant </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go to ----! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The same pitch-black color of the "Go ! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scarf, which was also the color of pitch black, flew over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the "Goliath Scarf" that Bell had untied from his neck and thrown out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was not a straight line shot, but an "indirect attack" that twisted strangely like a snake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The scarf wrapped around Ottar's pitch-black sword and stirred together, sealing the severed head slash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lv.7 vs. Lv.5. Normally a "tug of war" would never be able to beat the opponent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the twisted posture he had been in continuously since the gyrating slash had a negative impact, causing the Inuks' stance to waver for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This moment was enough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Justice is flowing! </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the chanting and close up all completed in the name of Blast, Ryu unleashed the magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He posed sideways and placed his star sword at his waist in『Juai-no-Type』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking  at  the  left  hand  resting  on  top  as  a  non-existent  sheath,  he  merged</p>
<p class="calibre1">『technique』and『magic』into one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--Kaguya, lend me your power! </p>
<p class="calibre1">What was released was the Jidou Secret Aeon once used by her arch enemy as well as her comrade, Gojono Kaguya. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Five Lights! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Star  Sword  sped  in  the  same  way  as  Gumi,  and  in  a  flash,  "Five  Slashing Blows" were born. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five  sword  slashes  that  flew  irregularly  from  the  front,  back,  left,  right,  and overhead. From the top of the head, from the left to the right, from the back, and from the front with a horizontal flash. It could be described as the sword of Jui-Ho splitting into five and swinging towards Ottar's body from five directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo-woo-woo-woo-woo!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gojono-Kaguya's magic [Five Light]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This magic can only generate 『Magic Slash』 at any position, but combined with her 『Juga Technique』, it becomes a sure-kill sword that cannot be defended or evaded. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p340"></a>Even a sneak attack would definitely be blocked. Even the Inferno of her confidant (Alizée) would be caught by him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because he was sure of this, Ryu used this five-light slash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As expected, 『The strongest』 blocked the frontal horizontal flash with his hand armor, and was then captured by the remaining four lights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  splitting  magic  blade  hit  the  chest  protector,  hand  armor,  and  forehead protector, destroying the few defenses [Fierce] had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blood spurted out of the martial artist's vision, bright red magic elements danced wildly, like flowers falling from the other side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell  immediately  pulled  up  the  black  scarf  (Goliath  scarf),  wrapped  around  the great sword yanked to his side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  hilt  of  the  sword  was  peeled  off  from  Ottar's  stiff  hands.  The  huge  sword fluttered in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The loss of weapons and defense. The decided 『defense power』 was halved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin's eyes dangled like twin swords and shouted </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fire, stupid rabbit!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell  let  go  of  the  scarf,  and  with  a  fierce  fire  coming  out  of  his  left  palm,  he unleashed his "magic" together with his master who was manipulating lightning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Flame Volt! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All Soldiers Fire (Carruthers Shield)!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blazing thunderbolt and the thunderbolts set in a dome shape were all thrown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An uncountable storm of magic engulfed Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! </p>

<p class="calibre1">The fire and lightning barrage hit its target while Ryu retreated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The firepower exploded instantly with the flurry of lightning shells with more than 500  rounds  left  and  the  rapid-fire  magic  (Flame  Volt)  that  fired  like  crazy.  The pigman in the center of the cannon fire was trapped in a vortex of lightning flames, denying him the opportunity to break away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thunder marks kept blasting. The teenager also kept shouting and shooting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To fight it out here and chip away at everything in Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black sword flying in the air fell with a crash, plunging into the ground like a tombstone, while Bell and Hedin still didn't slow down the pace of the shelling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Eternal Conquest, Undying Thunder General] - [Varian Shield]! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p341"></a>The moment the soldier's arrow cluster shot out, Hedin immediately wove a chant that called forth a huge general's light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The impact of thunder was like a final blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A huge cannon flash exploded in the center of the amphitheater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The violent impact and stormy wind pushed Ryu to Mia's side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Electricity and a lot of sparks flying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  left  arm  that  was  stretched  forward  was  finally  lowered  by  Bell  who  was breathing heavily, but immediately set up his dagger again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  the  first  level  adventurers  will  be  wiped  out  in  this  shelling  storm.  But  the enemy surpassed the norm. To snuff out carelessness and negligence. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stared into the depths of the fading smoke together with Hedin who was racking his long-handled sword, "Disaria". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Over  there  in  the  smoke,  a  large  black  shadow  emerged  from  the  center  of  the shelling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottarh was still alive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The giant tree-like arms interlocked with each other and stood on the ground with both feet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The steel-like flesh spurted out blood like Bell and the others, burnt to a crisp and badly damaged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(He was wounded-) </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Not even close to near death -) </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Can defeat-!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The light of hope kept shining into Bell's mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was sure that he could defeat the present-day Ottar and took a step forward, and just then. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The "Beast" raised his head from his interlaced arms, and his eyes, whose pupils were twisted like fangs, met his gaze. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"--------- ---" </p>
<p class="calibre1">His heart, his instincts were held tightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The light of hope that shone into his mind was replaced by 'the most dangerous alarm'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu  and  Mia  also  held  their  breath,  while  Hedin,  whose  face  had  changed drastically, shouted out in spite of everything </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p342"></a>"Hurry up and end it...! </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  the  block  of  sound,  which  was  enough  to  block  all  of  these,  made  a booming sound. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"The sound block that was shielded from all of this, however, made a roar. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It was a roar that resounded through the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No, it should be called the hiss of a 『beast』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  level  of  supreme  shout  caused  the  bodies  of  Bell  and  others  who  heard  it directly to lean back, causing all the people on that side of the 『mirror』 to fall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even the adventurers' bodies went limp and fell off their chairs, and the gods' eyes widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The monster's 『roar』, with its same fierce pig's intimidation (song). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This androgynous creature, though in mortal form, bound one's mind and body by virtue of the primal terror that compels one to stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This means only one thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is that the 'martial man' has degenerated into a 'beast'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  one  roar,  but  even  the  first  level  adventurers  (Bell)  were  robbed  of  their freedom for several moments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the eyes of 『Beast』 that looked up to the sky turned forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It fixed its eyes on the 『prey』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell and their hearts and bodies let out countless screams, and the next moment he began the 『real Luvishment』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">''Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!!!'' </p>
<p class="calibre1">InuYasha. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then march in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">First the bursting charge that causes the stepping stone slab to crumble, then the approach that is synonymous with violent pressure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without  allowing  evasion  or  resistance,  the  huge  shoulder  of  the  murderous weapon caught an elf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"---Kaahhhhhhhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The characterless voice forced through the throat, Hedin flew up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Bell and the others reacted and froze in place, he slammed into the wall of the theater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shards of stone flew everywhere, consciousness kept flickering, and for a moment his breathing was completely interrupted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither tactics nor strategy, but a ridiculous burst of shattering. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p343"></a>The power that surpassed even the magic blast made Hedin spit blood, and the next thing he saw was a palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look, aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The palm slammed into the face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The five fingers (tusks) of the fierce pig covered the view and appearance. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The glasses worn naturally shattered, and shards of glass and metal stuck into the skin, stirring up the white beauty. However, these are only small things. So small as to be laughable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The five instruction skulls sunk into the scalp emitted a mournful sound, and for a moment, Hedin's vision and the entire brain marrow shook. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The focus of vision shifted dazzlingly. Heaven and earth were turned upside down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Himself  was  thrown  out  at  an  absurd  speed,  so  fast  that  his  body  was  even spinning, and his intelligent mind came to the same conclusion as a fool. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the next instant, he was like a cannonball that blew the ground to pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bare, ah ------" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Master!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin  was thrown from the edge  of the theater to the  center  by Ottar, raising a large cloud of smoke and dust, breaking the stopped time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Understanding the situation, the adventurers moved quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They  blocked  in  front  of  the  『Beast』  that  had  transformed  into  an  instinctive collection to attack its prey, and Bell, Ryu and Mia vowed to guard the rear guard (Hedin). </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the front guard (wall) and the like were also smashed to pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「「「--------- -!?"" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A hammer called a randomly swung fist shattered Mia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even the little finger (claw) that did not take the shape of a hand sword cut Ryu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five fingers (fangs) diagonal a flash, digging down Bell's combat clothing, as well as the flesh underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dwarf who embraced the earth spat blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf dodged the attack and was touched just a little, but there was still blood splashing around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  human  who  carved  the  five  twisted  claw  marks  put  on  the  blood  attire  and turned into a bright red mannequin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p344"></a>Swordplay  and  martial  arts,  "skill"  and  "strategy"  were  forgotten,  and  instinctive rampage was followed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The forcibly imposed abuse neither accepts evasion nor recognizes defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Absolute attack』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Absolute defense backfired and eventually became a minion that existed only to slaughter the enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now  it  was  no  longer  a  battle  of  adventurers,  but  a  scene  of  the  weak  and  the strong, causing all those watching the battle to become blue in the face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Holy Maiden (Amid) lost all her blood color. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does it mean that ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Almighty (Asfi)'s lips twitched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"'Bestialization'......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gutsy (Finn) crooked up his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The [Fierce One's] real killer!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It says "become violent and strong", but there should be a limit to it! You're really a head-to-toe wreck! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermes and Loki, who were watching the same scene from the Tower of Babel, also raised their voices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bestialization". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among  the  orcs,  this  phenomenon  was  only  confirmed  from  a  few  races  and belonged to the struggle instinct itself. As Loki said, release the bestial nature and power hidden in the body, so that the body's ability to rise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most representative is the werewolf. The beasts of the wolf will 'bestialize' after bathing in the moonlight, gaining great power, and people will even say that 'no race is the opponent of the wolves under the moon'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... that big guy's 'bestialization' is different from the werewolves (us), neither do we have to choose the time nor the place ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burt stood at the slanting back of Loki and spat out these words with hatred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the time of obtaining 『God's Favor』, the 『Bestialization』 that was the origin of the orc race was closely connected to the 『Skill』. To enter the bestial state, one must meet certain conditions or be accompanied by certain risks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, I'm afraid that the trigger of "Bestialization", a condition for the activation of "Skill" of Ottar, is arbitrary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unlike  the  werewolf  who  could  only  be  "bestialized"  under  the  moonlight  night, even in the daytime, even in the middle of the labyrinth (dungeon) could fall into </p>
<p class="calibre1">"beast". </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p345"></a>Bert  knew  what  [Fierce  One]  looked  like  when  fighting  and  clearly  saw  through that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  effect  is  also  not  at  all  comparable  to  other  wastes.  That  boar's </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Beastification』 is not the enhancement ...... is the monster itself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tattoo on the left side of the face became distorted as the werewolf admitted that『Bestialization』which was no less powerful than his own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The 『Beast』 reflected in the 『Mirror』 was clearly different from the previous martial artist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Coincidentally, it was almost exactly the same as the sight brought by Haruhime's rank ascension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Many people fell down, and the city was almost considered to be in a commotion, when the adventurers in the tavern, whose blood was gone, murmured softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That, the current [Fierce One] is ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............Lv. 8?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one expressed certainty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because once they were sure, the battle would have lost the meaning of watching it. </p>

<p class="calibre1">[Eternal, Conquest ...... of the Indestructible, Thunder General] ......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cut into pieces and thrown to the far side of Bell and them, Hedin propped up his trembling body with one hand outstretched. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  appearance  wet  with  blood  lost  all  submissiveness,  and  he  called  up  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">『magic』of maximum power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「[Varian Syr--」 </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it was too late. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pigman, who could be described as a beast, sensed the breath of lightning and raised his fist like a rock high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell,  Ryu,  Mia,  and  Hedin,  who  couldn't  even  stand  up,  were  all  watching  in despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The muscular wrist became a crooked "fang", and in the next moment, the "fangs" </p>
<p class="calibre1">plunged into the earth. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow Ow! </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p346"></a>He swung down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Swung down with a great storm punch that blew everything away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--------- ---------- ---------- ---------- ------- Karma, ah." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shattering fragment of sound, I don't know if it came from Hedin or from Bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sssssssssssater.sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss The fierce pig's blow triggered cracking, stirring up the earth's crust, causing the earth to scream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The waves of shock that spread in all directions engulfed all adventurers equally, teasing them, blowing them away and burying them in the depths of rubble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The outer wall of the theater crumbled and forgot its original shape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even the cliffs against the lake fell downward, and the island terrain changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strongest roar of the day surrounded the "Orza City Ruins". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ground was no longer covered with slabs of stone, but pieces of stone, and right where these pieces were piled up in a heap, he pulled out his fist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When the dust dispersed, only one 『Beast』 was left standing there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The </p>
<p class="calibre1">sky </p>
<p class="calibre1">without </p>
<p class="calibre1">a </p>
<p class="calibre1">sissssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss ssssssssssssssssssngle  cloud  looked  down  sadly  at  the  battlefield  where  the adventurers who could not move fell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unknowingly,  the  sunlight,  which  was  boarded  with  an  illusionary  feeling,  was about to take on the color of dusk. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The sun tilted to the west and the earth roared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The violent shaking shook the whole ruins, and the hidden male god (Plutus) and goddess (Hathor) jumped up in fear, but the familia members still had to fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The opponents in front of them had to be defeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Give me more or less!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......! Stop it, brother, meow! I'm not going to lose to you!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  silver  spear  tried  to  swing  away  the  golden  spear,  but  the  golden  spear obstinately bit down and wouldn't let go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how many wounds, no matter how many scoldings, Anya still fearlessly rushed, facing him, Allen lost all means to cover up the anxiety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was too humiliating, too pestering a gesture that caused him to surge with killing intent, thinking that he must crush her this time, however </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So don't ignore me, Aron." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hagney! Hogni!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he was stopped by a black slash coming from the side. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p347"></a>Although he was not affected by the "abnormal magic", the black elf's wound had not completely recovered, but he still slashed at him, which further disturbed Allen's emotions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I said get out of the way! Get out of my way, maggot!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I did have to stop you. And thought about knocking you down. And ...... why do you need to yell at me, just jump over like you normally do?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The backlash from the spell sword made him fail to fully regain his strength, and neither could completely solve the other, and at this point it was hard to hide the fatigue Hogni showed a rare smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is neither a smile in the face of friends, nor in the face of familia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a clumsy smile that emerged from a man who, unlike his arch-rival (Hedin), was not very tactful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you tired, Allen? No, I'm not. It's not like that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aimed at a certain 『core』 and performed a 『disturbance』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's just because from now, your gun isn't sharp at all when facing your sister." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............... eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who reacted the most to those words wasn't Allen, but Anya. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  brother's  eyes  widened,  while  the  sister  on  the  side  stopped  in  a  twisted position. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... What kind of bullshit are you talking about!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aron covered the expression that was revealed for a moment with extreme anger and flew up to make Hogni unable to speak anymore. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the face of the approaching gun tip, Hogni still maintained a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Demon Sword Might, Bring Eternal Destruction" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he ended the super short chant that he had been doing beforehand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aron's face was tinged with shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lacquered black jacket that was already torn and tattered, the stand-up collar of the jacket perfectly blocked the lips of the black elf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The catman failed to see the lip movement, causing a fatal delay in his reaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Dain's Flame]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kah!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At a distance where the lance almost touched his opponent, Allen received a blast of flame emitted at extremely close range. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The range was extremely short, and the relative ability to completely blow away many enemies within the range of effect was a magic with special power. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p348"></a>He  hastily  kicked  to  the  ground  for  evasion  and  did  not  suffer  any  damage,  but black smoke still spat out from the mouth of the chariot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You  see,  it's  true.  I  can't  believe  you'd  even  take  the  bait  with  this  kind  of provocation." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Usually you must have dodged it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni pointed this out faintly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  current  situation  -  the  disorder  shown  by  that  ruthless  and  heartless  Allen made Anya even more sure of the thought of 『Morphee』 in her mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Brother-sama ...... is it really ......? </p>
<p class="calibre1">「Why are you putting on that stupid look! How can you understand so much! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every time her elder brother roared, her body would shrink and her tail curled into a ball. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen's anger was exactly the same as she remembered, making Anya about to flinch, but she pressed her hand tightly against her chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After hesitating for a long time, and after several attempts to speak, she opened her mouth and said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Before coming here ...... [Fierce Wolf] said to me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... What the hell are you talking about ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya looked at her brother, who was mixed with anger and difference, and recalled the memory of a few hours ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was when she was forcibly taken out of the room by Burt and walked towards </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Battle Wilderness』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Let  go  of Meow-!  Meow  was abandoned by both Syr and  elder  brother-sama meow! They don't care what happens to meow! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Emotionally unstable and self-destructive. Anya was fussing and shouting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seemingly  annoyed  with  her  like  this,  the  gray-haired  werewolf  spoke  from  his heart without thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">'That shit cat ...... is a lot like me. I really don't want to admit that.'' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If I didn't need it, I would have killed it. After all, it's an eyesore and noisy." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Woo, woo ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Burt's dangerous words made Anya speechless, and then he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But, since I left it ......, the meaning is obvious." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya's eyes widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Keep looking ahead, keep running werewolf he  - said: I really fainted to tell you this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He quietly spat out these words, and never answered Anya's doubts after that. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p349"></a>"Brother-sama ...... hates meow?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course I hate it!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Brother-sama, did you give up Meow ...... because you hate Meow so much? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What else is there to say now! You don't even understand! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, why not kill meow? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya's pupils, who were not smart by any means, trembled and tried to translate her words into her own "Why? . </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Always say kill you, kill you ...... but why not kill meow? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya's teary pupils stopped Arun's rant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  the  siblings  become  stagnant,  Hogni,  who  had  been  watching  silently, slowly opened her mouth and interjected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... is right, Arun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He said the 'core' that Hogni himself had summed up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you still love, you can't abandon it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"------" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, you can only hate." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a flash, the heart of a cat was exposed nakedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two cats looked at each other with wide open eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aron's lips twitched up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did not open his mouth to scold. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A variety of emotions filled his face, a look that could no longer be described as anger  alone  surfaced,  and  he  took  a  step  towards  the  elf  who  was  babbling nonsense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aron ...... sorry ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before that mouth let out a roar. Before those feet lunged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni lowered his eyes and spoke the 『truth』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Although  you  said  that  you  seek  strength  beside  the  Goddess  (Freya)-</p>
<p class="calibre1">sama ............ but you have become weak." </p>
<p class="calibre1">「！」 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing this unexpected correction, Allen was really dumbfounded this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  elf,  who  is  the  same  first  level  adventurer  as  him,  continued  from  the perspective of someone with the same power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hedin also said the same thing as me. ...... Do you remember? When it came time to decide on a new deputy head, Hedin voluntarily gave up and gave way to you. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p350"></a>This was many years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, Anya was still in 『Battle Wilderness』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin, who had been elected as the deputy head, firmly refused and forcibly gave it to Aron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At that time, Hedin knew that you were stronger than him ...... so he gave it to you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That guy's reserve does not allow a weak guy to stand in the high position of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">[familia]." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But  after  ............  sister  was  gone,  you  became  weaker.  Without  something  to protect .................. Allen, you're weaker than before." </p>
<p class="calibre1">He wasn't referring to ability. Nor is it the rank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If it were those, Arun would have surpassed what he once was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What Hogni was referring to was the threat level, the temperament, the verve, the will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before and after giving up his sister, these things are decisively different, he said so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So  Hedin  also  said  ......  that  he  was  'too  disappointed'  in  you.  He  was  very angry ...... that he shouldn't have given you the deputy head." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the 『truth』 that even he had no way of knowing, or could not possibly perceive, Allen was astonished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing  everything  that  had  been  confessed  by  the  elf  that  had  not  been  said, Anya froze in place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni, who had been sealed by the goddess - pleading with him to 'not tell the boy until he perceives it himself', bowed his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ What a joke ............ What, joke... ......... kidding what, what ............!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It can't be helped, Arun ...... you can't deny it anymore." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni  very  guiltily,  resisting  the  inner  self-condemnation,  but  also  with  the conscience of thinking of the cat (him) as much as possible, gave the last blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tough  warriors  (we)  can  only  express  ourselves  through  fighting,  so  never deny ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time Aron really froze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the proof that no matter how much he freaks out and scolds, Allen himself will never deny this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tough warriors will never compromise on 'power'. It would not cheat on the matter of 'might'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  what  the  "warriors"  who  were  evenly  matched  with  him  said  about  his strength, and they did not conceal it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p351"></a>"Brother, my lord ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya also understood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It wasn't that Anya barely dodged the fatal wound in this battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather, Allen had let him dodge it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  Hogni  intervened,  the  sure  kill  that  was  released  in  order  to  make  her unable to stand up was also aimed at『right shoulder』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was equipped with golden shoulder armor, which significantly reduced the ability to kill, and was not at all like a blow that Allen would use. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  battle  between  the  siblings  had  been  delayed  until  now  because  Aron  had stopped his hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm a loser, a king of nothing, without a familia, but ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black elf whose self-evaluation fell to the depths of the  underworld belittled itself while raising its head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With those trembling, yet calm ocean-like eyes, he spoke out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Arun, the way you are now .................. I think it is wrong." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wind blew over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of the wind replaced the sound of weapons that no longer rang out, and the damp wind passed between two and one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of silence separated the place from the battlefield, blowing each other's hair, when the black bangs blocked the pupils of the cat's eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--There was once a cat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He has always had a love/hate relationship with his blood relatives. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he was very young and weak himself, he was buried  by the ruined world and  wondered  how  many  times  he  wanted  to  give  up  his  only  sister.  I  can't remember how many times his heart wavered and he wanted to push her away and leave her behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the cat still kept protecting his sister, the crybaby, the incorrigible fool, the sister whose song was bad enough to destroy everything and annoy herself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because the sister has been singing a song, poor enough to die, lost but not alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because he turned his back on her and didn't let her notice that he was showing a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">『I will keep fighting with that chronic share. So, please abandon that guy.' </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the cat was saved by the goddess, survived every day of 『Baptism』, and finally was forced to stand at the fork in the road. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing his sister who almost died with him, the cat first cursed his own weakness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He decided that he had to become stronger, and at the same time, he was ready to give up his love. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p352"></a>"Please  let  him  leave  the  battlefield  where  the  weak  cannot  live,  and  leave  my world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat was very clear. The slow and slow-witted sister would not leave herself voluntarily, and would definitely die one day as long as she threw herself into the battle to pay the price of being saved by the gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat had understood. The dark period would not tolerate his weakness, nor his naivety. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I will also break off my relationship with that chronicler. It is enough for me to have the goddess (you). I will agree. So-' </p>
<p class="calibre1">While being attracted by the  goddess' divinity, he expected  his relationship  with</p>
<p class="calibre1">『her』to be -『Complicity』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Giving up his sister and being taken to the tavern by 『her』 to have other familia members and create a place for her to stay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat swears he will be faithful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Giving everything he has to protect his sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turned himself into a 'chariot'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had decided that he would bring death and misfortune, and in order to keep his sister away from himself, no matter how deeply he would hurt her, he would remain the only 『Chariot of the Goddess』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The 『Best Love』 that was one with his abomination in the table, from before to now, never changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allan Fromel could only change the 'supreme love' into 'supreme hate', and in order to pray for his sister's happiness, this was the only way he could do it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen lifted his head and looked up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Look at the beauty of the sky that attracts tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looked at the alizarin glow that was gradually approaching from the western sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Brother-sama ...... has been treating meow ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tears flowed from Anya's eyes, who knew her brother's true heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ties that had never been lost, the presence of 'familia' made her chest lose control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Brother ......! I really want to be my brother's familia again! Brother-sama is also with Syr and the girls-'' </p>
<p class="calibre1">So Anya poked out her body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So Allen reached out with his left hand and put up his left palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's okay." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No need to say it." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p353"></a>It was not a voice of anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a voice that spoke quietly and sincerely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the voice of a "brother" who was thinking of his sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I will not let the goddess disappear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......! Brother-sama, why? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My loyalty to that person will make me strong. And what makes me strong is the contract between me and that lord. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling her brother's unwavering will, Anya cried and confided, yet </p>
<p class="calibre1">"My battle will not end until I kill the black dragon that destroyed my homeland. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"As long as that black dragon (dragon) remains, your happiness will be blown away again. Then ...... when I run to seek the end, you will definitely follow me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Allen『real purpose』, both Anya and Hogni's eyes widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The anger and hatred in Arun's eyes disappeared, and he looked at his sister's figure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya's equipment, the shoulder armor of gold, was on the right side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arun's shoulder armor of silver is on the left side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It goes without saying that each other's guns are a pair of gold and silver. It was almost like looking in a mirror. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pulling the right and left wheels of the chariot containing the goddess (Fromel). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The iron bond that will not break no matter how much Aron desires, the curse of gold and silver that made Anya throw herself into battle. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"To guard my sister (you) - I will kill the wheels (you). </p>

<p class="calibre1">There is one more expectation of the goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is『Charm』. The absolute 'power of beauty'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I hope to inflict it on this stupid and dumb sister to make her forget her elder brother (Aron) as she forgot the girl of 『Boxing』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let's give up our own incorrigible "selfish desires", which we have been avoiding until now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bury  your  "desire  (selfishness)",  and  never  again  think  that  "after  everything  is over, if there is still a chance, I would like to hear that bad song again someday". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  chariot  (Arun)  will  crush  the  wheel  (Anya)  who  knows  everything  with  'the greatest love'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, he will never bring an end to 'Goddess'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The wheel of gold, the collar of silver--" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p354"></a>Therefore, Aron hummed the song of the chariot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Chanting! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Brother-sama can do magic! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni was astonished. Anya also began to falter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My sister did not know. I didn't know that my brother had "magic". </p>
<p class="calibre1">That "magic" was revealed after parting with Anya - that's strange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Aron who would never chant it in front of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Love  of  abomination,  fantasy  of  wreckage,  destiny  has  been  set.  Disappear, golden wheel, before the rut kills you". </p>
<p class="calibre1">I will not chant this ugly incantation because it will reflect the  depths of my own heart, where anger and hatred cannot be hidden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't want to chant this "truth" that I am thinking of my sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo ......! Stop him, stop him, stop him! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"---! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Hogni who slashed at her, Anya also threw away her hesitation and kicked the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If we continue like this, we will lose the girl (Syr). I will also lose my brother (Arun). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced  with  the  high  and  terrifying  magic  power,  intuition  found  this  and  forced down the contradiction of doing harm in order not to lose her brother. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The price has been paid for [Whip of Glory, Lip of Favour. Turn the silver wheel, until the day this head falls to the ground]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Hogni's sword could not cut him. Anya's spear could not stop him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chanting  and  moving.  There  are  two  kinds  of  actions  that  are  performed simultaneously.  He  just  retreated  backwards  dramatically.  Keep  repeating  this action. In this way alone, Allen's body was like a feather being blown by a strong wind, and he retreated backwards for dozens of M. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no need to attack. No need to defend either. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just run away comically and hold on until the spell is completed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because after the song finishes, all that will be left on the battlefield is 『Ruts』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Until the other side of the sky, listen to the song of the wheel (dream) of the time after death - carrying the divine will of the goddess and going forward]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The last three bars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All  the  attacks  hit  empty,  causing  the  faces  of  the  two  Anyas  who  he  finished chanting to stiffen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the next instant, 『The fastest chariot』 was activated. </p>

<p class="calibre1">「[Granzer Fromel]" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p355"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen's starting body took on a pale silver flash. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Neither decapitation nor magic could stop it, and the Rushing Stream of Light hit Hogni first, sending him flying into the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Super speed. It was still increasing. The more you run, the faster it gets. Like a spinning  wheel,  like  a  chariot  riding  on  the  battlefield,  the  『Goddess  Chariot』 </p>
<p class="calibre1">truly came and went as it pleased, running in a single bound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Brother-sama ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Anya was blown away and hurt, but his onslaught still didn't stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hogni, who turned into rags with only one blow, slammed into the ground, and at the same time, he changed direction and headed for other battlefields. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is that!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Woo-meow-! Hurry up and run-!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The flash flew through Aisha and the others who were fighting with Alfrigg. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even the chariot (Allen) itself could not control its speed, and the "rut", a trajectory of  a  snake  like  the  long  body  of  a  shining  dragon,  appeared  instantly.  Not  only evasion,  but  even  escape  was  not  allowed,  and  the  chariot's  speed  of  light mercilessly swallowed up the adventurers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aisha's large Park Blade shattered and slammed into the grave. Mikoto and Naza flew as high into the sky as Hogni, and Runoa and Chloe were knocked away by him with the force of a duel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Arun, you---!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Alfrigg was affected by the ripples, and was swept into the rut of light along with  his  three  brothers  whose  consciousness  was  severed  and  churned  into  a mess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Granzer-From]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen's  only  『Magic』,  super  high  enhancement  of  『Agility』,  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Transforming speed into power』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That means the faster Allen is, the stronger the destructive power will be. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  is  no  upper  limit.  Theoretically,  as  long  as  Allen's  speed  increases,  the power of the assault will rise infinitely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After wrapping the armor called flash, Allen can rush away everything with this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even the floor master can crush to death the ravages of the chariot. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p356"></a>"Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  touching  the  aftermath  of  the  chariot's  speeding,  Miach's  『Flower』  was blown away and Lily was blown away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The eye crystal left the maiden's hand and crashed with cracks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The advance attack could not even be seen, crushing all obstacles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  Allen  sped  past,  both  the  remains  and  rubble  all  disappeared,  and  only </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Rut』 remained. </p>







<p class="calibre1">The smell of dusk gradually drifted in from the west. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sky overhead was still blue, but it would soon be tinted with the color of dusk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the color of the end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the warriors who had been fighting in the "Battle Wilderness", it was the color of the end that announced the end of the battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar picked up the black sword that had fallen at his feet and slowly glanced to the west. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked in the direction of the hill where the House of God was standing, which was gradually colored red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............, ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... ah ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the amphitheater that was completely destroyed, the only one left standing was Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dwarves and elves buried in  the rubble were  only occasionally moving and were already in the wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, is this the end? </p>
<p class="calibre1">While the pigman was thinking this without emotion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Karma ...... ah ......! ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A man let out a beastly whisper and stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Long, dusty blonde hair. Covered with a layer of blood and injury makeup, there is no trace of beauty in the appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  the  pair  of  red  coral  eyes  would  not  let  go  of  the  light  that  was  about  to disappear. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p357"></a>"Hedin ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar is really still without any emotion, just watching the same strong warrior as himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  elf  managed  to  get  to  his  feet,  almost  falling  several  times  and  steadily stepping back down, raising his head and glaring back at the pig man in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is this what you want to do?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottarh said almost as if provoked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin crooked up his lips and forced a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who knows, what does ............ look like ............ to you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At least, not like your style." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  pupils  were  still  distorted,  and  the  『beastly』  state  of  Ottar  answered  him with words that still had the voice of reason left, but were very plain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You value efficiency, you could have done better and won this battle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha ......! District, victory ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin's lips dripped blood and snickered at his statement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This, boring war (game) ......! From the moment I betrayed you, it's been a dead end ......! If only I would go and break that lord's 'flower' wouldn't it ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the destruction of the base camp, Hedin broke into the  『House of God』 </p>
<p class="calibre1">and snatched the 『Flower』 from Freya's hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  that  case,  the  war  with  the  exaggerated  name  of  "Faction  War"  would  have ended in a hurry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But ...... that's... meaningless... ......! That kind of thing, it's meaningless! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What I want to do is not that kind of thing! </p>
<p class="calibre1">His words began to take on heat, and his spirit kicked up the limits of his injured flesh, overriding it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That lord has freed me from my duty as a 'king'! Then this time, it's me! I must drag that lord down from the throne of the queen (king)!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar listened to his monologue speechlessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"She must be freed from the so-called 'yoke' of the goddess! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin could not understand the goddess like the daughter of the gods (Horn), even if he could surmise her heart. Even so, his heart, which knew what a "king" was, found out the misfortune of the goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  the  smile  that  emerged  from  the  'girl',  he  already  knew  what  her  'true expectation'. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p358"></a>This cry could not reach the ears of the Goddess on the throne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, this will reach the hearts of those who had not yet risen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you know! Do you know the face of the goddess who seeks "love" and suffers because of "love"? </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the room of the gods once upon a time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The mask of the goddess who was confused by "love" with the hair ornament of an elf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a click, the dwarf's fingers grabbed the rubble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you understand! The one who gave up all the things other than 『Love』, but still suffering the same as the girl, her attachment! </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the conversation facing the teenager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a conversation with a young man, a girl who was only seeking the heart of a young man, and a girl who was torn by the ties of abundance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a creak, the elf's hand clenched the wooden sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did you notice it or not! The tears are still wetting 『her』 cheeks!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the last motivation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenager first trembled like a flame. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If  you  noticed,  why  did  you  still  lose!  If  we  lose  this  battle,  her  tears  will  never stop!!! A lonely victory will get 『Love』, and that lord will always be a goddess!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words that shook the surrounding area kept beating their hearts. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words that shook the surroundings kept beating their hearts, stimulating them to move their feet that were ready to stand up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then! We must disgrace her face! To bury the sublime goddess! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Even if Freya-sama would not allow such an act?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What kind of a servant is it if you don't do your best for your master to save your life! If you don't have the awareness of being hated, what kind of familia is it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he said so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is the 'loyalty' that I will dedicate to 'her'! </p>

<p class="calibre1">This is the reason why the Elf (Hedin) is the Knight of Loyalty (Hedin Selander). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The foolish will to draw his sword against the goddess even if he bears the brand of a sinner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything is for『her』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was as if he had been touched by this very capricious, pretentious, and unusually noble sin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p359"></a>The dwarf peeled his body off the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three pairs of eyes stared at the 『wall』 that was blocking in front of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You disappear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You disappear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You disappear." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin's faith, Ryu's will, and Mia's fighting spirit ran Ottar through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... will you, knock you down ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the teenager stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go to Miss Syr, there ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The people who confronted each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The people who kept fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The souls that the goddess had fallen in love with at first sight made Orta narrow her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The goddess has given favor, but you want to reject it, resist, right ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only the teenager, he looked out at all the people whom the goddess loved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Very well, come on." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he raised his black sword and looked at them with the eyes of a "beast". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is the end." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The final battle was declared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no chance of victory. There is no way to live. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But still, they struggled and tried to catch the light, and the "adventurers" were the kind of people who would not give up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's why they will definitely attract the "Golden Light" when they stand up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Manabu Mallet】-[Dance]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Foxtail』 fell from the sky as a cohesive ball of light, wrapping Hedin, Ryu and Mia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Their stunned pupils immediately reflected the intruder's figure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell-kun, Elf-kun...! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"God-sama!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia, covered in sweat, came running through the gully formed by the destroyed outer wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind  her,  Haruhime  stood  on  the  rubble  on  the  southwest  side  and  was unleashing her magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Following Lily's instructions, they kept struggling and finally reached Bell and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell-kun, light up your back!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p360"></a>"One  last  update of  [Ability  Value]! Turn  the [Experience Value] you gained into your power!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia shouted at the panicked Bell with an air that was about to pounce on him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I heard that! You're going to defeat that [Fierce One], aren't you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're going to defeat that [fierce man], right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're going to go, right? Go to Freya's place - the kid's place! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell's eyes widened, and then she nodded her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he turned around, he saw Ryu and Mia smiling sideways at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Waiting for you, Bell." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's go have a little fun!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin didn't even look at him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He didn't even look at him, just showed his back and said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hurry up and get it over with. Stupid rabbit." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Yes!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Bell chose to believe Hedin and them, and got down on one knee on the spot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Losing his armor and his battle suit split, even his back was full of new wounds, the  teenager's  body  caused  Hestia  to  turn  blue  for  a  moment,  then  he  dropped divine blood and began to update [Ability Value]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  adventurers  and  the『beasts』threw  the  teenager  down,  turning  the completely ruined theater into a『battle wilderness』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ummmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmmm! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first blow of the opening battle was Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black sword was raised high and swung down, and the Ryu girls spread out in three directions to evade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Now the words can deal with the attack!!! But...) </p>
<p class="calibre1">(This level of sublimation (light) is really hard to handle! (If you're not careful, you'll be led by the power!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Even so, you have to master it, otherwise you can't win!) Heretic child-related battles are experienced in the Ryu aside, Mia and Hedin are the  first  to  experience  the  level  of  sublimation.  The  dramatic  increase  in  power named Lv. 7 made them feel surprised and a little shuddered. After that, they used their own spiritual power to hold the reins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The three of them used their different tactics to attack the [Fierce]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mission Accomplished, The Balance Will Be Right"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu chose to fight in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  fearlessly  jumped  to  the  top  of  the  wingless  body's  head,  which  could  not move freely, and disturbed Ottar's vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p361"></a>Ryu wanted to gain air control. She wanted to try an 'air and ground pincer attack'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like  an  elf  flying  around  with  flashing  wings,  she  distracted  Ottar's  attention overhead and boldly lowered her sword of stars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottarh hated the sharp meteor chop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  easily  blocked  or  dodged  it,  bored  with  making  the  great  sword  dodge,  and Koryu  even  used  "Kotai  Blade  -  Double  Leaf"  to  slide  across  the  surface  of  the enemy's attack. A lot of sparks flew, and the impact that seemed to tear her body apart was completely blocked by her ability to reach Lv.7. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where are you looking, you idiot!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia, of course, chose to fight on the ground, the exact opposite of Ryu. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She wouldn't allow Orta to go after the elf she failed to tackle, rushing into the arms and swinging down the giant shovel hard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was also defended by Orta. Just as he intended to crush Mia from the front, the immediately resurrected Star Sword imposed another impediment from above his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dividing  the  enemy's  consciousness  into  heaven  and  earth,  slowing  down  his counterpart. Preventing him from ravaging. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The bountiful chain made even Lv. 7 of "Bestial" irritable, and the chant of justice was completed in a flash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Justice is flowing! -[Grand Harvest]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">What Ryu inherited and activated was the only healer in [Astraea's Familia], Maru's </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All Restoration Magic". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her own recovery magic (Noah's Cure) only works on one person. The effect is good but slow. So Ryu chose to rely on her power that had been healing herself and others. The purple star particles also flew to Bell, who was still updating her </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Ability Value], and healed the surface wounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Very resourceful, Ryu!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pain was relieved and Mia, who had gained vitality, struck a more powerful blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not far from her at the back, Hedin looked down at the plate with precision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But even if the wound is healed, our spiritual power will soon be exhausted! We can't fight for long!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He is taking charge of the overwhelming center back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no point in concentrating on the rear guard. With the lack of personnel, even  with  the  increased  strength  nowadays,  he  would  be  overwhelmed  by  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Bestialized』 fierce pig. Hedin played at a level comparable to that of a top-class forward, and swung his long-handled sword at Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p362"></a>He would also use  magic  shots decisively regardless of the  distance to actively close the gap between Ryu and Mia. True to his name, he performed the duties of his original top level midgard profession, 'Magic Swordsman'. Without his glasses, he  was  no  longer  an  intelligent  magician,  but  instead  looked  like  a  wild  warrior, fighting with Mia and the girls against Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look, look, look, look, look, look! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar gave up "Absolute Defense" and chose "Absolute Attack" - he chose to beat each other up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He let his body reveal its bestial nature, while maintaining the rationality of a martial artist and being in the middle of a deadly fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did not say it was a hunt and enjoyed the situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rather, he ignited the instinct for struggle and met the adventurers who let out the roar of the weak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with the 'absolute attack' where evasion and defense were useless, the first level adventurers used skill and wisdom, and a flash of light to survive. If a blow is sure to knock him down, then let him not have a chance to make a move. Hit him hard with magic and peel off the 'Absolute' armor. Use attacks from three directions to disrupt his sense of distance, interfere with his accuracy, and eventually make him hit empty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  adventurers  used  their  only  defeat  as  food  to  become  smarter,  more adaptable, and stronger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The full movie of All Levels Ascending also strengthened the momentum, breeding antagonistic combat situations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... so powerful." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking at this scene, Bell said softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The figure of the adventurers on the distant peak fascinated the young man who had just become Lv. 5. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's nothing great about it! You're going there soon, aren't you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lord God ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're going to fight alongside those great adventurers, right? So..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia carved [Sacred Text] on the back of the young man who was kneeling on one knee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without allowing any delay, she shed a large amount of sweat, and precisely and smoothly made the dark cluster of words dance above  - noting the beginning of the story that was about to begin. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Bell Cranel </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p363"></a>Lv. 5 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Strength: I 41 → G 222 Endurance: I 39 → F 340 Dexterity: I 49 → G 245 Agility: I 77 → F 311 Magic: I 4 → 98 </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luck: F Abnormal Resistance: G Escape: G Combo Attack: I The total upward value of all ability proficiencies is over 999, and it has grown so rapidly in just one battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it's not enough. Not enough at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even with this level of growth, the top where the "strongest" was located was far beyond despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So - don't lose, Bell-kun!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the goddess still shook herself and the boy's heart and shouted out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Win, Bell! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell stood up violently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The God's Dagger held in his hand felt the growth of its user and lit up intensely itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell-sama, please also - get the victory." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the golden-furred demon fox showed a smile and offered the last tail that was saved for the teenager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Manabou  Mallet].  The  ability  rose  sharply.  A  forced  sublimation  in  just  twenty minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if Haruhime fell into a deep sleep, the miracle of golden light would not be cut off. So the young girl who used up all her strength slowly collapsed, engraving the  countless  particles  of  light  wrapped  around  her  back  into  her  eyes  and  lost consciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I pray that the teenager will have martial luck and victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm going on!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under the gaze of the goddess who was holding the maiden, the teenager kicked to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bathed in the voices of the people in the city that would never reach his ears, he plunged into that battlefield. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Go! </p>

<p class="calibre1">The real endgame began. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p364"></a>Everyone  who  had  the  qualifications  to  fight  joined  in,  and  the  『Battle Wilderness』 let out its final roar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Orario on the other side of the mountains turned the remaining power into solidarity, and the adventurers challenged the 『Top Point』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What was born was a magnificent attack and defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bursts  of  inflammatory  thunder,  dazzling  white  and  pitch-black  chopping  flash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Once the righteous psalm was sung, the star sword and the petals of flame blasted, and  the  stardust  entwined  with  the  green  wind  descended,  countless  thunder soldiers launched a surprise attack with a command, and the strike of the people of the earth who joined the battle caused a crack in the Great Sword of Black. With the  king  who  is  in  charge  of  the  lightning  as  the  center,  the  four  of  them  are intertwined with each other, and the stream of power and speed is flowing rapidly in all directions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite this, the confrontation of the fierce pig also does not move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite  the  rabbits  showing  their  fangs,  the  elfs  singing,  and  the  people  of  the earth  exhausting  their  mighty  power,  the  [Fierce  One]  remained  at  the  top.  He swung  his  black  sword  out  of  the  earth,  and  his  flesh  of  steel  became  a  shield, beating  his  opponent  with  the  meaning  of  "strongest"  on  the  other  side  of  the boiling tide of blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lv. 6, one person ......! Lv. 7, three people! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The usual calmness was long gone, and Asfi who looked up at 『Mirror』 shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Broken  battle  power.  This  level  of  foul  formation  was  enough  to  easily  break through the labyrinth『deep layer』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Generally speaking, there was nothing they couldn't break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even so ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"『Still can't be defeated ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lamentations of Eina of the Guild Headquarters and Iblee of the Vestibule were heard simultaneously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The input of the proposed Lv. 6. Together with the white rabbit whose agility value was out of control, this was the last boost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even so, it was still unable to capture the [Fierce One]'s base camp. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the hell ~~~~! How can I win that one! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How do I know!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The older sister (Tionne) shouted back at her sister (Tionne) who couldn't help but shout, as if trying to silence her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There is a loophole! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p365"></a>"Ottar's 『Bestialization』 isn't invincible!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gareth and Riveria gazed at the sight of the endgame and shouted out the only breakthrough. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"General Wisdom (Hedin) should know it well! Non-stop attack!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn threw away the chief's mask and asked them to keep their bravery and reap the endgame afterwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Overtake him ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ace clenched her hands on her trembling chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「Win over him! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking at the scarred teenager in the 『mirror』, the blonde haired and blonde eyed girl simply prayed for this thing to come true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't lose!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf girl shook her short hair and shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Humans,  Dwarves,  and  Amazons  all  raised  their  voices  one  after  another, breeding a huge wave of sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They shouted and shouted in solidarity with all their strength, raising their clenched fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow! </p>
<p class="calibre1">And, the one that removed all of those pleas, the roar of the king pig. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice of the Absolute, who does not allow faint hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The people lose their words and their faces go pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm sure there will be no one cheering for the men. Even if there were, that voice would be very small and few. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On this lonely battlefield, [The Fierce One], however, for a moment, smiled like an illusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the roar that kept booming, Freya stood up from the  throne for the first time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  goddess  of  beauty  couldn't  use  either『Mirror』or  the  eye  crystal,  so  she couldn't quickly grasp the details of the battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, she could still hear the cries of the "beasts" now, making her aware that the dependents were maintaining the "bestialization". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Stop, Ottar." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p366"></a>A『skill』that Ottar possesses, [War Pig Invocation]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This skill related to "bestialization", as seen by Wolfman (Burt), can be activated at  will.  It  can  bring  a  huge  increase  in『Ability』including  basic  ability  and development  ability,  giving  a  power  so  powerful  that  it  can  be  mistaken  for sublimation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, there is a drawback. Every time you activate a "skill", you will lose a lot of strength and mental power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  longer  the  "bestial"  state  is  maintained,  the  more  physical  exertion  will  be accumulated, and even the automatic healing (ability) that is manifested cannot be fully recovered. The difference between the two is that the "bestialization" of the wolves (Burt) is not dangerous as long as the condition under the moon is met. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stop it, Ottar!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he continued to fight like this, he would run out of strength sooner or later. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before that, he should return to himself and regain his overall strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The long hours caused the walls to crumble, and Freya called out to him  toward the  amphitheater  in  the  northwest  direction  that  was  revealed  in  front  of  the column, knowing that she could not convey it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hoo-, hoo- ......! Well ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar, who had been fighting, said in his heart that he was very sorry and bowed his head to the goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only now, one cannot obey this should be worried about their own divine will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can't  turn  his  back  on  the  will  of  these  people  who  want  to  defeat  himself,  the martial male still has the eyes of 『beast』 and let out a growl. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo-woo-woo-woo!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fierce power was even further enhanced at this point, causing Bell and their faces to be distorted from the wariness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like them, the martial artist in front of them was also wounded. The serious injuries caused before the "bestialization" were still there, and now he was also using Mia and  others  who  resembled  Lv.7  as  opponents,  so  it  was  impossible  for  him  to remain unharmed. The flesh of steel was indeed in crisis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even so, he would not fall down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like a nightmare, the man kept releasing sweeping attacks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenager was overwhelmed by Ottar's aura and stepped backwards. Even so, he still shouted with a great aura that he must not lose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He struck a blow into the muddy body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now it was a sure kill that could defeat even a giant, but the enemy simply flicked it away as easily as if he was waving a baton. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p367"></a>What a monster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The man in front of him was the real deal, a 'martial artist'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The man who lived through the era of the male god (Zeus) and the goddess (Hera) and who endured the most "mud of humiliation" never gave in and finally gained strength, and now he was about to use that strength to crush the enemy. His five fingers  (fangs)  can  easily  crush  the  windpipe  with  a  simple  brush.  He  can  be described as both a loser and a winner. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though he tried his best, he still could not defeat the man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite surpassing the limit, he still could not get the victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with the look on his face as he let out a roar and shouted back, dribbling down blood-blistered saliva to devour himself and the others, the teenager felt the most profound terror in his short career. </p>
<p class="calibre1">( - even this!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tricks were all used up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strategy was ineffective to begin with. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All of his abilities were inferior to his opponent's. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The conditions for defeat had been put together, and at this point Bell had the only weapon left - his will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(And also to bring Miss Syr!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">A young girl who is said to have died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She, who has always helped and supported himself, decided to hurt her with his own hands and then save her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He sublimated this ugly selfishness into a boundless battle intent into a decisive strike of death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The White Illusion flashed. The inflammation shot out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to drive away all the so-called terror, he ignited his whole body with awareness and determination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've made an appointment to save that person! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Blade of Hestia seemed to echo him, releasing a deep purple slash against the top of the lacquered black greatsword and biting into it with Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin, who was breathing heavily, looked at the sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Extremely uncomfortable sweat could not stop dripping down. The mental fatigue that hadn't been felt for decades was approaching. From the annihilation of Haider and the Cinderellas with full Bellies, he had used "magic" more times than anyone else, and the backlash caused Hedin's spiritual power, which had the most total amount in the city, to be on the verge of depletion. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p368"></a>Hedin knew that he was about to lose his effect, so he looked over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Look at the unbearably green, stupid to look at, but still fighting the figure of the teenager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin did not have the eyes of a goddess, he could not see the color of the soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Did not know what kind of glow it was. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But he knew that the pure white roar, its source must be something transparent and flawless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is it really unpleasant ...... to poison even me, ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously the weakest one, but showed the most daring will to engage with the </p>
<p class="calibre1">[fierce one], resounded all around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu  and  Mia  also  followed  his  stance.  The  scarred  side  and  back  led  the adventurers forward. The sight was almost like a ship sailing on a magnificent sea, more majestic than anything else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(That idiot ...... must not have chosen 『Mate (Odr)』.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">No, it was that he couldn't choose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If he had chosen that, then things wouldn't have become so troublesome at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because he didn't choose that, he was the only one who could make her notice</p>
<p class="calibre1">『『. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was really too hateful to bear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, surely, even so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That foolish boy will become a "hero (Oded)" to save "her" as Hedin predicted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「Well ............ I agree with you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin laughed out loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  people,  the  adventurers,  the  gods,  laughed  out  faintly  where  no  one  was paying attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"---! Hedin, get out of the way!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Mia's shout, he snapped back to his senses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one approaching in front of him was none other than a 『Mastodon』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar broke through the front guard, trying to first crush Hedin who was gradually reaching his limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「--[Eternal Conquest, Immortal Thunder General]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it was within his expectations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin  had  guessed  that  Ottar  would  not  let  go  of  his  useless  self  and  quickly constructed a super short text chant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Varian Hild]!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The thunder cannon was shot out at extremely close range. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p369"></a>Using himself as bait, he threw out the final hook and fed him to the inescapable Thunder Blast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Direct hit! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Fantastic ----!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of Ryu making an observation, the smile shown by Bell who shouted with joy, produced a crack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin also froze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "pig burst" was bathed in the turbulent stream of thunder, first engulfed by it, then squeezed to the sides and came into view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar appeared after breaking through the barrage and released a fierce sura chop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin set up "Disaria" horizontally with the speed of a god possessed, and then the long-handled sword was cleaved along with itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Karma, ah ------" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fatal injury. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if the earth people (Mia) could resist it, the elf (Hedin) couldn't withstand the diagonal wound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blood that was so hot that it seemed like it didn't belong to him splashed, and Hedin's  back  was  sucked  towards  the  earth,  and  at  that  moment,  his  pupils reflected the figure of the 『Beast』 who was about to strike the second slashing flash. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--- Master ah ah!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell turned into light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Accelerating  sharply  with  all  his  might,  he  reached  his  hand  towards  the  overly misguided rescue of the outcast. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What touched Hedin's shoulder first was not the sword strike that swung down, but the teenager's fingertips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sword strike that failed to catch the elf split the ground, and the next instant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The explosion-like impact shook the eardrums. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin was pushed out, and Bell was similarly knocked away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hedin!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell-kun!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voices of Ryu, Mia, and Hestia disappeared into the smoke and dust of the explosion. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p370"></a>Bell rolled uncontrollably on the completely destroyed stage, unable to know even the  front  and  back,  let  alone  Hedin's  position,  he  pressed  his  head,  which  was producing ringing in his ears, and stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Master! Master ah ah!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as he was panicking like a lost child, constantly changing his orientation and looking around haphazardly, the sand and dust had dispersed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deep  in  the  field  of  vision,  the  Inu  can  be  seen  standing  there  leisurely  in  the center. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the  left  and  right  were  Ryu  and  Mia,  and  further  away  were  Hestia  and Haruhime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They were saying something. But nothing could be heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He couldn't ignore the 『Beast』 eyes that were staring closely at this side, but still  wanted  to  make  sure  Hedin  was  okay  and  was  about  to  search  the surroundings, and at that moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look forward to ...... ......" </p>

<p class="calibre1">"----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a world where nothing could be heard, only these words could be heard clearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go and save her ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A trembling arm, as if it had no more strength left to teach people a lesson, touched Bell's back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice that will disappear at any moment weaves that 『Aria』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Eternal, high song ...... of indestructible, holy girl] ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">That『Magic name』was said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Laurus Hild] ......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lightning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Awakening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He scorched himself (Bell) with thunder - not so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Empowering Magic』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blessing of the thunder suit that envelops the whole body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holy Maiden Rezan (Laurus Shields). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin's third and final 『Magic』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is a rare magic that heals the wounds of the target like a healing saint, and grants the protection of lightning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most important feature is that it cannot be used on the caster (Hedin) himself, but must be given to a person who is recognized by the high elf (Hedin). </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p371"></a>He  exchanged  all  his  spiritual  power  for  this  power  and  entrusted  it  to  himself, causing Bell's pupils to open to the limit. </p>


<p class="calibre1">"Go to ............ stupid apprentice ............" </p>


<p class="calibre1">"--------" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He became incandescent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the thunderbolt guarding his whole body, he shook off all the various emotions stuffing his chest and head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No tears will be shed. Never turn back to look at the fallen 『Enji』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The palm of his hand stayed against his back, as if to send him forward, and as if pushed by this palm. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenager turned into a 『Thunderbolt』. </p>

<p class="calibre1">He launched a surprise attack. </p>





<p class="calibre1">The distance between himself and the [Fierce One] in front of his sight instantly disappeared as the twin swords of thunder flashed by. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「！？" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with the sea of thunder slashing that swung out eagerly, Ottar hastily used the pitch black greatsword as a shield. </p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/5j1XvFn/171989.jpg" alt="171989" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1">A fierce lightning and thunder was born. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also born was an abnormal 『speed』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell, who is constantly emitting electrical discharge, is the embodiment of lightning, and attacks Ottar with a speed that exceeds even that of Ryu, who resembles Lv. </p>
<p class="calibre1">7. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The white rabbit's attack (Rabbit-Rush) - Leihua (Hild). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The trajectory of thunder covers the glow of dazzling white and deep purple. This is  the  continuous  chopping  attack  of  Raging  Wave.  The  left  and  right  hands brought up streaks of shadow, releasing a combo that produced as many as forty-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p372"></a>four chopping strikes in a flash. [Fierce One] blocked all of them - only to find out that he had made a mistake in choosing 'Absolute Defense'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo, Ow Ow Ow Ow ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He came into contact with Raiden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  lightning  perched  in  the  decapitation,  passing  through  the  pitch-black greatsword from the side of the defense and continuously penetrating Ottar's giant body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except for the main god, none of the warriors of their own faction valve (Freya's familia) knew about this last 『magic』 of the elfs (Hedin), whose specificity was firstly its speed, and secondly its broken 『power』 and 『penetrating power』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I rate it as the "worst condition" because it is activated at the cost of all of one's remaining mental energy, but it brings a power that is very different from the usual magic that is given, and it gives a great protection to the target. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The armor of lightning that focuses on attack and speed is comparable to Ace's Wind Armor (Wind Spirit Sprint). </p>
<p class="calibre1">What's  more,  every  time  an  attack  is  defended  against,  it  does  accumulate damage, and can be said to be the nemesis of Ottar's "Absolute Defense". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bae, Bell-kun will snap and glow when you attack ...... I can't see anything!!! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young goddess desperately tried to get a closer look, but ended up blocking her face with her hand, while aside from her, Mia and Ryu used the excellent visual ability of the first level adventurers to see the situation accurately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dagger's slash carried lightning, and each blow possessed the same power as the Thunderbolt Arrow Cluster (Karus Hild). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar tried to evade, but Bell again used his 『Agile』 to match, turning it into a scythe of thunder and lightning that blocked the retreat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(It became faster!!!) The speed of the foot, the speed of the attack! Even 『reaction speed』! (You can clearly see Mr. Ottar's movements!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not to mention the speed of movement alone, even the perception was affected, and there  was an  increase, and Bell felt  the power  that Master's magic (Laurus Shield)  possessed,  and  felt  a  sense  of  omnipotence  that  was  different  from  the level ascension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The body had fully recovered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bursts of lightning, the salute of the Virgin took back the color and sound of the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whole vision was surrounded by electric flying foam, very dazzling and vivid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell's  ever-accelerating  spirit  crossed  over  to  the  other  side  of  the  thunder  and lightning, and it seemed that all could feel the breath of Hedin. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p373"></a>Then, it will be able to go to any place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It would be able to defeat any enemy. --Must be beaten to do so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pulling the fierce threads of thunder, Bell let out a cry. </p>

<p class="calibre1">The furious waves of Thunder Chop, the brave and magnificent trajectory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the blade of thunder, the blades of "White Fantasy" and "Hestia's Blade" were extended, like two one-handed swords. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The atmosphere in the city reached a climax when I saw the heroic figure of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Knight of Thunder Sword", which would be featured in Hero Tan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I can do it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Izumi shouted at the awakened posture of Bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young man's majestic posture as he kept running towards victory made Aiyana pray sincerely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  young  man's  majestic  gesture  of  running  towards  victory  made  Eina  pray sincerely, "Oi, Oi, Oi, Oi, Oi, Oi, Oi, Oi, Oi, Oi, Oi, Oi, Oi! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  orphans  (lai)  saw  the  vision  of  『Hero』  from  the  back  that  challenged  the enemy and kept standing up, and sent out a solidarity. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"「Well ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow! </p>

<p class="calibre1">However, the 『Topper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"?" </p>

<p class="calibre1">Even though his whole body was burned, he still returned the thunder attack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He threw away his "Absolute Defense" and asked for an ultimate battle that ignored his defense, despite his injuries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although Bell was able to react to the strike of the great sword and evade it, the sheer  monstrous  power  still  threatened  his  body.  Even  when  pushed  into  a desperate  situation  by  the  status  quo,  Ottar  still  drove  『technique』  and </p>
<p class="calibre1">『strategy』, instead putting the teenager who was inferior to him as an adventurer in crisis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The eyes and violence of the 'beast', and the weapon and mental power of being a 'martial artist'. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p374"></a>Bell kept getting hit and his eyes began to shake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The body that had completely recovered instantly took on the wound again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Level  ascension  and  saintly  girl  Rezan  (Carruthers  Hild),  bearing  two  special miracles, but still unable to defeat the 『strongest』 in front of him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fierce might of 【Fierce One】 gradually chipped off the golden light and the thunder light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So from now on, it's the "duel" where everything is at stake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--------- ---------- ----- Ahhhhhhh!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  teenager  with  the  master's  thunder  let  out  a  thunderous  roar  of  thirst  for victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  guardian  protects  the  goddess  so  far,  swearing  that  this  is  absolute guardianship. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  Thunder  Blade,  Great  Sword,  Inferno  Thunder,  and  Great  Fist  all  let  out  a whisper of breakthrough and destruction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell went mad. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottarl is even madder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  at  this  moment,  turning  stand  and  destiny  all  into  the  fuel  of  life,  pouring everything in order to defeat the enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blood was instantly burned by lightning and splashed onto each other, and the two kept slamming into each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(---I know. --I know! --this feeling!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mighty Bull (Minotaur). </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the formidable enemy (Asterios). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The origin (root) that gave birth to the adventurer (Bell Cranel) is in the martial artist in front of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The reason, reasoning, explanation, and assumptions were all skipped, and Bell discovered this with his intuition, forcing an even stronger verve from his soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can't lose. Do not want to lose. Do not want to lose to this opponent! </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how much he was wounded, no matter what kind of desperate situation he was in, he had to surpass this martial artist alone, and the will that vowed to </p>
<p class="calibre1">'become stronger' on the walls of that castle screamed so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However - only now could I not recreate that battle with my "powerful enemy". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ryu! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia and Ryu swung their fists and swords at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They also had the same will to win, to fight together with Bell to defeat the "Fierce One". </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p375"></a>This is not a private fight for Bell. There was no mistaking that. This is a "battle" to stop  her  and  save  her.  It  is  necessary  to  stomp  on  the  personal  feelings  of  the male (Bell) and recall the vow of the hypocrite (Bell). </p>
<p class="calibre1">So. So. So. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell clenched his teeth and looked back at the rust colored eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm sorry, I'm too weak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm sorry that I can't even fight it out on my own. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm going to beat you with everyone - so, I'm sorry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He made his gaze carry a lot of apologies, as well as the determination to not back down, and stared hard at the pupils of Takeshi's eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was clearly impossible, but Orta seemed to let out a snort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--It's still fifteen years too early, he seemed to say. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get out of the way! </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  matter  how  badly  he  was  wounded,  this  man  would  not  go  down.  He  would never make way for Bell and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was like a 'wall'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Words and thoughts are useless, and you must use your strength to pry open the iron wall door. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deep inside the wall, there was a princess with light gray hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No, that's not true. It's not a cute thing like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one waiting ahead was a "witch". </p>
<p class="calibre1">A bad witch who loves to play tricks on people, who is free to do as she pleases, and who has an unpredictable mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A "girl" who locked up Bell, teased Ryu, distorted the world, and didn't even know why she was crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Parallel power accumulation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The power of thunder maintained the rapid movement, while the right hand holding the dagger gathered pure white particles of light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tone that resounded around was not a clock, but a large Bell tower. --Boundary lifted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar instantly understood that Bell had unleashed [Heroic Wish]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">During  the  initial  battle,  he  had  experienced  the  power  of『Hero  Wish』.  He noticed that it was a move that could kill his heavily wounded self. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore the fierce pig changed its target and turned its body. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p376"></a>"Goo-woo!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「Damn it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu and Mia formed a wall in front of them, and they were able to withstand several blows, but eventually they were broken through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, they also bought time to build up their strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mia-san! Ryu-san! I'm on!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  Ottar  rushing  towards  him,  Bell  who  shouted  out  the  two's  names  also made up his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stopped in his tracks, sank his body and set up Hestia's Blade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Twenty seconds of stored power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He met the eyes of Ottar, who was holding a black sword in one hand, and then sped away with his feet. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The distance grew closer and closer, and the spacing between the two gradually dissolved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The white light gathered in his right hand, and his rigid wrist with veins emerging tightly gripped the hilt of his great sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the moment when the mutual strikes clashed, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu shook his shoulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(The right arm lifted up...!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I mentioned in the "Deep" duel, Bell's "bad habit" comes out when she is in a hurry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the case of a duel, revealing the preparatory action is fatal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Ottar would never miss that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The attack would  be thrust from the right side. The attack track was  completely seen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">InuYasha let out a powerful flash to cover Bell's blow and cut down the weapon and the man together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Nooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar's flash and Ryu's wailing sounded at the same time, in this instant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(--- Hooked!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell  put  the  『Habit』  of  his  right  arm  to  the  side  and  switched  to  an  attacking motion. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p377"></a>""!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar and Ryu showed the same reaction that shocked them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The attacking stance that should have been a jab from the right hand switched to a sliding spade as if it had been planned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pigman swung a flash horizontally only to catch the "Hestia's Blade" that did not have time to escape and flew away from the teenager's right hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, during this time, Bell's left foot reached Ottar's right foot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sliding spade with thunderbolts aimed at the unsuspecting right knee and flew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hm!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hiss!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Painful blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strong blow that was increased by the Rank Ascension and the Holy Maiden Rezan took away Ottar's posture. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(That's-) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing this sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only the half-villain Van, who was lying on the south side of the audience, froze. </p>
<p class="calibre1">『...... Bell. You have a habit of raising your right arm, don't you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh ......? Ah, yes, it seems to be raised when you are in a hurry. ...... Did you not correct it? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's the opposite. You pay too much attention to it and try to correct it, but it makes it easy for your opponent to read your right hand's preparatory movements when attacking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's a memory from the past. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  advice  Van  gave  to  the  young  man  who  was  a  false  familia  member (companion) in the "Box" built by the god of beauty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just leave it there and don't worry about it. Use the habit as "bait" by incorporating it into the attack and defense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Although  you  can't  use  this  move  too  many  times,  you  can't  win  against  a  first rank adventurer without infusing everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell actually did it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He used the "habit" of raising his right hand and used it as a "bait" to lure the first level adventurer (Ottar) to attack, regardless of his "habit" of raising his right hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even the advice of Van, who had been a false familiars (companions), was turned into food for growth by him - and used it at this critical moment! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That bastard!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Van slammed his right fist into the ground, and an expression of sincere hatred emerged. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p378"></a>And the lips that were twisted from anger looked like the shape of a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Half-Little Human's ploy poked the first level adventurer, avenged an arrow, and created a fatal gap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The [Fierce One's] once motionless lower body swayed a bit, bringing about the decisive moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well done, boy!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia,  who  was  called  by  name  by  Bell  before  the  assault  and  the  only  one  who sensed his intention, had run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She swung a full force strike at Ottar, whose eyes were wide open and who was unable to perform "absolute defense". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Take it, ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The steel shovel exploded in the right side of his Belly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The huge body of the pigman left the ground and flew into the air. </p>



<p class="calibre1">Blood  was  spitting  out  of  his  mouth,  and  the  eyes  of  the  'beast'  couldn't  stop shaking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, the giant shovel embedded in the flesh of steel broke from the root. Mia instantly let go of her hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, as if to pay back what she had encountered so far, she rained down a fierce rain of 'fists'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come  again,  come  again,  come  again,  come  again,  come  again,  come  again, come again, come again, come again, come again! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  rain  of  clenched  fists  beat  Ottar's  forehead,  cheeks,  chest,  shoulders,  and abdomen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only this dwarf in this urban ruin was able to inflict damage to Ottar with her bare hands, at which point she began a one-sided physical fight like an angry wave. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...[Cut  through  the  sky,  through  the  wilderness,  beyond  all  things!  The  Light  of Hosted Stardust Destroys the Enemy]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">After being stunned, Ryu also turned to a shelling stance without hesitation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dark green magic formation unfolded, and full spiritual power was poured into it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with only one good opportunity, she called for the magic of stardust with her maximum magic power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Starlight Wind]!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The great light jade of the green wind took over from Mia who retreated after the beating and engulfed Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p379"></a>All of the bullets hit. Not a single shot missed. The [Blast of Wind]'s flurry snatched the lacquered greatsword away from the pigman and zapped it into a corner of the far audience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo ............ ah ............!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Amidst the whirlwind that birthed a large amount of magical elements, the heavily wounded Ottar reappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just at that moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bam--, bam ----. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, it was Bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of the Great Bell Tower resounded all around as he released the white light that was still converging in his right hand, which had lost its dagger. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Thunder Rabbit's Claw (Vorpal-Fang). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The attack hit directly to the chest, causing Ottar to crack his jaw. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then. </p>



<img src="https://i.ibb.co/QQN7Mhr/171990.jpg" alt="171990" border="0"></a>



<p class="calibre1">The sound of the cannon. </p>






<p class="calibre1">"--------- ---------- -----!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A huge inflammatory thunderbolt with a stored power effect. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cannon struck at zero distance, this time really blew the giant body of Ottar away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The white flame sang high and engulfed everything in front of it, hitting the west side of the amphitheater and opening a huge hole to the audience and the wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The island shook. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p380"></a>The ruins trembled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sky, thoroughly tinged with the color of dusk, sought the course of victory and defeat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ha ah, ha ah ............ ha ah ah ............!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell weakly drops his right arm, his whole body  breathing  heavily, gazing in the direction where Ottar disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The right hand that used all its strength kept coming with severe pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  shock  of  the  heartbeat  made  the  vision  shake,  and  the  heart  and  eyeballs seemed to fly out of the body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(If this can not defeat him ......!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell no longer has the strength to fight. Ryu and Mia, who were barely standing, were also bruised all over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They stared intently  in the direction of the rising smoke, as if they were praying desperately. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Together  with  Hestia,  who  was  holding  the  fainted  Haruhime  and  nervously watching the developments, they waited for the time of fate ............ Just then, the shadows shifted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The smoke and dust timidly parted to the left and right, and the giant body of steel that should be described as completely destroyed emerged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even so, [the fierce] still feet firmly on the ground, back in the theater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">".................. ah ......... ........." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inwardly close to yielding, clenched his teeth to force it down. Even the jaw can still make force itself is already a miracle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Faced with this nightmare, Ryu dripped endless sweat, Mia tightly frowned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia was weak and her face was pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  figure  of  'The  Strongest'  slowly  approached,  causing  even  Orario  to  be dominated by the silence of despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............, ............,... .........!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like a tree that has carved deep wounds and slowly falls to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar's body leaned forward, after a ground chirp, one knee on the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell sucked in a cold breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ryu, Mia and Hestia all face shock ah. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  pigman,  who  was  bleeding  and  gasping  for  air,  had  lost  his  huge  aura  of dominance. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p381"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Fierce One] Silence laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>


<p class="calibre1">Ilta's scream that could even reach the huge puddle lake rang through the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Orario was the first to be surrounded by a huge cheer, while the ruins known as the amphitheater was a little abnormally quiet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If it was that Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even from now on, is it still possible to fight? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as Bell and the others were holding this worry, on guard, holding their breath, and making time flow meaninglessly, the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ottar, can we win?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia boldly asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell and Ryu turned their heads at the same time, and Hestia watched the situation with trepidation, when Ottarh, with his head down, slowly raised his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His  right  eye  was  blocked  by  blood,  so  his  left  eye  took  its  place  to  gaze  at  a teenager who was still frozen in place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Can you liberate that lord?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rust and crimson pupils looked at each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can you save him? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only Bell's eyes were wide open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ can!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only response received was a nod of the head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar stared at the scarred teenager's face for a while, then slowly closed his eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Five minutes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Waiting for you for five minutes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing his words, except for Mia, Bell and the others were taken aback. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After my body recovers, I will go and stop you. In the meantime - show me your answer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually, the surprise turned into understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There must be nothing false in his words. As soon as his body could move, Ottar would attack Bell and the others again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no need to ask if he really needed five minutes to recover, it would only be superfluous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell and the others had already shown their power to Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p382"></a>The walls that had been guarding『Magical Girl』opened the gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Win, win! It's a win, isn't it? I don't want to see this kind of battle again! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia, who didn't look at the atmosphere at all, took the dagger of the gods she picked up in one hand and dragged Haruhime to them. The young girl who was grabbed  by  both  armpits  and  whose  buttocks  and  tail  were  rubbing  the  ground moaned as if she had a nightmare, Ryu who came to Bell's side, and Mia who was holding  the  elf  (Hedin)  both  returned  the  smile  and  nodded  their  heads  in affirmation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That boar boy will not break the agreement. ...... Don't talk about it, kid. Can you still run?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's embarrassing to say ...... we can't move at will anymore. I'm afraid we won't be able to reach the Syr." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking at Mia and Ryu, who were well on their feet, Bell sensed their meaning and dawned on him. Only Bell, who had gotten a reply from Hedin's Holy Maiden Rezan, had any strength left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The right hand that had boldly built up its strength was no longer useful, but it was still able to quickly rush to 『God's House』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell-kun, go now! Miach and Supporter-kun's side has ...... all been destroyed." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Was it [Goddess Chariot] who did this? ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia, who had grasped the battle situation of the "main battlefield" through the eye crystal, urged with an iron face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The shaken Bell aside, Ryu was also full of worry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If Allen, who had the fastest footing in the city, caught up with him, it would be over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The current Bell would definitely lose if he fought him. It was imperative to reach the Goddess before he stabbed him through the back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hurry up, boy. This goddess will be guarded by us. We won't be stupid enough to let the flower be taken away from us! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go on, Bell." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... I got it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mia and the girls glanced at the silent Ottar, and Van who was desperately trying to get up, and after hearing them say that, Bell immediately got ready. The black scarf and other protective gear that would hinder running were all taken off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally, Hestia handed out the black dagger and gave it to the lighter Bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, Bell-kun. I'm sorry for making you do this kind of thing. ...... please!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p383"></a>He looked at Hestia and Ryu. And Mia and Ottar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As well as the unconscious Haruhime, and the still sleeping Master (Hedin). </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the rank sublimation on his body as well as the lightning, Bell ran. </p>







<p class="calibre1">"...... Ottar?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In the eastern part of the 'main battlefield', Allen tilted his head to look at the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fierce 『Beast』 roar that had been sounding just now disappeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Normally, he would be convinced that it was Ottar who had gained the victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, a moment before falling into silence, Allen heard the familiar tone of the big Bell tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Beyond  the  island,  on  the  outer  side  of  the  lake,  the  atmosphere  of  the  judges (Ganesha familia members) also always felt a little cheerful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Did that bastard ...... miss!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aron ignited his anger again and turned to the northwest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the 『Rut』 behind him, there lay the adventurers and tavern clerks who were all destroyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only strong warrior still alive was Allen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only he was not fighting for the goddess  - no matter what the truth - but for his sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the watershed. Today's scene is the result. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the sake of his sister, the only one who expects to be the goddess' faith is not poisoned, not confused, unshaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... brother, big, people ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  eliminating  all  the  obstacles  in  the  way,  Allen  looked  at  his  sister  whose eyelids were trembling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He narrowed his eyes as if dropping them and immediately ran. The voice of Anya, who had lost her strength, could no longer be conveyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "chariot" had to complete its duty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is, to gallop. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Defeat Ottar la ah ah --------- --------!!! ............ but." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p384"></a>Tiona  raised  both  fists  high,  first  happy  for  a  while,  and  then  put  on  a  serious expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「What  is  the  situation  now!  Where  are  Agno-kun's  companions!  How  many enemies are left! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The only one who can still move is Bell! The enemy has [Goddess Chariot], and then there is ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The four guards of the 『House of God』 ...... or God Freya." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Tiona's noisy voice, Ace who had been staring at 『Mirror』 spoke up in a rare manner, followed by Rivelia making an addition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The prima donna so far - no, it could now be called a feat of a big blowout, causing the other members of the group besides the cadre to also talk within the meeting hall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The enemy still has five people ......? That [Rabbit foot] is not ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, the highest on the guard side is only Lv. 4. As long as that strange demon magic  and  Hedin's  Ray  are  still  there,  that  young  man  now  can  force  his  way through. As long as they don't get caught up by Allen, there's still hope." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... And what if he is caught up?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gareth spoke his calm analysis to the overwhelmed Tionne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tionne asked this with trepidation, and it was Finn who answered her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If we get caught up, it's over. Even if he finds ...... it will almost certainly be a dead end." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The final victory is a primitive "you chase me". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The little human brave asserted so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, what's this going to look like? ............ What's this going to look like? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......, Bell, come on, come on, come on!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, you damn it! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aren't you Freya-sama's personal guard! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Run, Freya-sama ----!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  "Tower  of  Babel",  the  gods  were  overwhelmed  by  the  unexpected developments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  gods  who  didn't  expect  it  to  take  so  long,  the  gods  who  were  calm  but  still couldn't calm down, the gods who were attracted by the "unknown" of their familia members and couldn't help but turn from the camp of the gods of beauty to the gods on the other side, etc. In short, there was a lot of noise, and each of them switched  the  "mirror"  image  on  their  own  and  desperately  tried  to  sort  out  their plates. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p385"></a>Usually the gods are light and airy, this kind of gesture is not rare anymore, and it can be said that this is the first time we see it. To the gods, a situation like "Queen (Freya) is in crisis" is so impactful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then what? What are you doing, little white boy?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......  Loki,  there  is  an  act  among  children  called  asking  the  gods  for  blessings, right? So who do you think we gods should pray to if we're going to pray?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... It's either the big dumb gods or your favorite god?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not the old man (Zeus). Absolutely not. He must have just laughed at the show. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Okay,  Astraea,  Artemis,  and  barely  Athena  ......!  Please  bless  Bell-kun's escape ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Although it is true that they are all good gods, your preference is not too biased class leader attribute ah ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hermes began  to  pray with folded hands, seeing that familia  (Asfi) will certainly see the posture of the discouraged Loki emerging speechless expression - just at this time, only to hear the 'ch' sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bert, who was standing at the back and looking out at the 『mirror』, smashed his tongue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... What a pity, Hermes." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loki glanced at the dependents and then looked back at 『Mirror』, and then said to Hermes who had a stiff expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You can only bet on the "you chase me". </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of his eyes, the panoramic view overlooking the island reflected the figure of the chariot approaching the target at an incredible speed. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Faster, faster, faster!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell repeated the process of moving south and west. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deep in the field of vision, on the westernmost cliff of the island, sat his destination, </p>
<p class="calibre1">'House of God'. However, there was still a distance between the two. The current Bell could reach it in less than three minutes, but in this condition, the less than three minutes seemed too long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had already entered the temple area. Here the many remains of the structure are  all  destroyed,  there  is  almost  nothing  to  block  the  view.  In  the  midst  of  this ruined area, which could be described as an unobstructed view, Bell fought against his heartbeat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(It will be over! If that person finds out, it's over!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell knew very well. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p386"></a>He knew very well how vicious he was in that "box court", and how vicious he was in the "battle wilderness" with Hedin and the others who were also "baptized". </p>
<p class="calibre1">He already knew the power of the "fastest foot" that could not see anything and would only be penetrated by it, never allowing himself to escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He did not dare to look around. Hiding was tantamount to suicide. Will be easily found by the nose of the orcs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because the only thing Bell could do was to sprint forward and pray to the gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  as  the  people  of  the  city  were  the  first  to  feel  despair,  Bell  was  also immediately penetrated by that despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"---" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no need to look for enemies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ironically,  the  teenager  was  very  sensitive  to  the  sight  precisely  because  of  the gods of beauty, and he immediately noticed the 『glare that wanted to kill him with his eyes』 with considerable regret. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">My throat was dry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My tongue was very dry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The body was sweating profusely even though it was obviously so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell succumbed to the weight and looked over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"------ ah." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The threat was approaching. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of wheels rang out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fastest "chariot" was approaching... </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Found you." </p>

<p class="calibre1">Without hesitation, the teenager's feet began to accelerate at maximum speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell, run, run, run, run, run, run, run! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the Ryu girls who left the amphitheater and climbed up to the roof of the ruins, Hestia shouted at the sight in front of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Run!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Faster!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ais and Tiona knew it was pointless, but they still shouted at the mirror at the top of their lungs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p387"></a>hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh hhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The screaming contest has begun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Urban  ruins,  labyrinthine  cities,  the  wailing  of  people  who  could  only  watch exploded everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sprinting boots (running shoes), the crushed rough brick road (runway), and the fate  (baton)  of the two camps (dependents) were handed  over to these two people alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat's gallop easily turned the hope that was easily clenched into despair, and chased after the white rabbit's back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't come over, don't come over, don't come over, don't come over, don't come over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Run! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Think of something! [Rabbit foot]!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside the island, at the first aid office of the Dian Cecht Familia, Mord, Guile and Bors,  who  had  been  treated  by  the  saints  (Amid)  and  woke  up,  shouted  at  the Mirror of the Gods, and fainted one after another as their brains filled with blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell  did  not  know  that  he  was  bathing  in  all  kinds  of  screams  from  all  kinds  of people and was just running. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He poured all his strength into his feet and had no time to deal with the external information. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(So fast!!! Coming after him from directly behind!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen's route was to run first towards the amphitheater in the northwest, and then change direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When he intended to rush to Ottar's side and ran to the northwest zone, the first level adventurer's vision had caught Bell who was heading towards 『The House of God』 and quickly changed his route. There was also the worst bad news for Bell, that is, after the caster (Anya) had fallen, the bind of the abnormal magic had been lifted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The unseen tracker turned into an overwhelming weight that drove the escapee into a desperate situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He swings his arms. Desperately swinging. Falling feet bit into the earth, kicking it backwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But still the sound of the wheels could not be shaken off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not  little  by  little,  but  cruelly,  the  distance  between  the  two  men  is  dug  down  in great chunks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Breathe - the breath is getting closer!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p388"></a>Bell-Cranny's greatest weapon was 『Agile (speed)』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the opponent pursued from behind with a speed that exceeded this 'agility', putting himself in a crisis, and this first experience, the shock that he had never felt before, threatened Bell's limbs. </p>







<p class="calibre1">"Bekun, run ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The eye crystal released the goddess' intermittent shout, causing Lily to forcefully wake up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「Bell, my lord ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The eastern part of the 『main battlefield』 that was swept away by Arun. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the stone wasteland where no one could stand up, Lily was not fatally wounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm afraid that the other party thought that she didn't deserve to be excluded and therefore just scraped her a little. And the fact that Lily just woke up, there was no way to move normally, and could only speak softly to the eye crystal held in her right hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She also didn't notice that the crystal, which was full of cracks, was no longer able to carry the sound to anyone's ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is there anyone ...... to support, Lord Bell ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one replied. She knew very well. She had tried once a long time ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even so, Lily could only issue a plea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is there anyone on the westmost side of the island ...... 『House of God』, near the ...... shrine, in the zone ............ ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It can only be described as miserable. It's really too humiliating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not even considered a commander. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily was reduced to a young girl who was just crying and worrying about the body of the teenager, and kept murmuring in a weak voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  temperature  of  the  left  arm  with  broken  bones  was  abnormally  high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Consciousness was very hazy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Arms,  shoulders,  abdomen,  chest,  legs  and  feet,  and  back  are  heating  up,  and gradually  do  not  know  what  they  are  talking  about.  But  Lily  still  spoke  out  the information and prayers, and her wishes, and kept on talking. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p389"></a>"Is there anyone ...... is there anyone ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if struck by this impotent thought, the [Sacred Text] on the back glowed. </p>







<p class="calibre1">"The biggest victory (dramatic scene) has come! It could have come but it came anyway! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Iltae was sweating profusely and kept yelling out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He had forgotten that it was still a real-time broadcasting job, and just spilled his heart out, and made a fiery voice beside the gods (Ganesha) who were watching with clenched teeth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Whether you cry or laugh, no matter how you shout, this is the last!!! The great race  between  [Rabbit  foot]  and  [Goddess  Chariot]  -  !  Uh,  oooh wahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! It's already here ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having  been  bathed  in  the  raging  emotions  of  Ibri,  the  magic  stone  amplifier (microphone) finally reached its limit and became useless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the youth still kept shouting  in his own voice. Together with the  people, the sound of grief kept coming out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first start (yield) was swallowed up in a flash, and Allen was closing in on Bell with the naked eye, and his figure must have made all those who supported the youth turn pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"----!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell launched a challenge as fast as he could, the wind pressure even caused the white hair to let out a sad cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On both sides of the rubble, silent solidarity rose and fell. The rubble dyed in sienna waved the banner of the wind. The dusk sky burned red with excitement as they followed the course of victory and defeat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The golden light and the thunder light propelled the young man who kept running alone. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p390"></a>The light that leaned on the body brought an increase in foot power beyond the limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even though the demon  fox and the  saint gave themselves, the  goddess of victory still did not smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even with such a foul power, he still can not shake a chariot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Using [Hero's Wish] to build up force on the feet ...... No!!! As soon as the instant acceleration breaks, I'll be stabbed through the back with a reaction!!!) Tricks won't work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only thing that makes sense is to run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Same with Ottar at that time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even  though  he  was  using  all  kinds  of  foul  moves,  he  couldn't  defeat  "City Strongest", and similarly, he was about to be run through by "City Fastest". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't try to run." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tracker's voice from behind finally reached his ears through the sound of the breaking wind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rabbit kicked hard to the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cat, determined not to stay away, chased after him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only through the view of the 『Mirror』 could he see the trajectory of the light and the fury passing through the ruins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was almost like a shooting star. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The golden grains of level ascension trailed a broom-like tail, and the streak of light of the Holy Maiden Rezan traced the trajectory through the relic wilderness without a path. Then this tail and trajectory was again run over by the chariot 『Rut』 that repeatedly accelerated purely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Can't shake ......!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not just the sight, not just the breath, even the sound of footsteps had come behind them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chariot did not swing his arm like Bell, he took aim faintly and waited for the moment when the gun held in one hand stabbed through the back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The heartbeat was too intense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The vicious pressure was about to crush him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(But - it's not over yet!!!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the fierce agitation, Bell still did not meet the 'defeat condition'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are two iron rules for "runners" of the race. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Do not turn back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not to feel "no more". </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p391"></a>The former needless to say, that is just a waste of running. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While this also has a tactical aspect, basically, the act of looking backward exposes a breach and fuels the momentum of those in pursuit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The latter is just as self-explanatory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As  soon  as  the  thought  of  giving  up  flashes  through  the  mind,  the  runner  is defeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By instinct, he understood this - no, the only thing in the teenager's mind was to save her, so he maintained his speed even in the face of adversity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Third-rate running with the feet. Second-rate run with arms. And first-class with the mind to run. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then the adventurer - to run with the soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell decided to burn himself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Set a goal to turn himself into ashes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, the destination is right in front of you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if the current situation is very desperate, there is 『she』 waiting for the light (the end) is ahead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the only thing to do is to struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is the same as the adventure (all along). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who struggles to the end will win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Waiting for the goddess of victory to smile? Go eat shit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who catches it with her own two feet is the one who wins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Let's go...) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Strength is still there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Breathing is not disturbed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feet can still move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The heart, lungs and legs are willing to do Bell's bidding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then it was just a matter of sprinting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a click, the gears in Bell's mind cranked up a notch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A part of his back was burning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He seemed to hear the voice of the young girl (Lily). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a low murmur I (Bell) is here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so the teenager became a device that existed only to escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--Do it!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell and Allen, both of them started the final acceleration at the same time. </p>


<p class="calibre1">『Final race ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah -------- ----!!!' </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p392"></a> </p>

<p class="calibre1">Iltae's roar struck the gong of victory and defeat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The final straight line that stretches all the way to 『The House of God』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crumbling relics hitch up the  barren  stone road, and the  teenagers and the chariot run through at speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one would stop them. No one would seek their own death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like a group of stars crossing the sky, they turned into light and ran towards the time of burning out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Useless." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Within a distance of almost no gap, Aron narrowed his pupils. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Three more steps.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without heat and anger, amidst the wind and cold air that slapped his body, he came to a cold conclusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Calculate the range at which the silver lance would run him through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pitch of the 『Chariot』 that will crush the rabbit no matter how it struggles. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Two steps.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gap shortens. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The backside becomes closer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He goes around directly behind the teenager and uses him to block the wind and eliminate the last distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(One step.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was about to swing his lance in the name of maximum speed, and just then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen felt that something was wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The spacing of the spear created an error. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A misreading? </p>
<p class="calibre1">He quickly corrected the result, trying to fill in the two steps of spacing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen felt something wrong with this violation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The error was getting bigger and bigger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From two steps to three, three steps to four, to five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten - </p>
<p class="calibre1">and it was still increasing! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gap that shouldn't have existed became 'absolute distance', further and further away from him!!! </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Hey...) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Silver Lance trembled. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p393"></a>(Wait a minute...) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The wheels are cracking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Are you kidding me?) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dusk-colored sky shook violently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What the...?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  moment  he  realized  he  was  being  pulled  away,  Allen's  eyes  widened  in surprise. </p>



<p class="calibre1">"It was so fast! </p>


<p class="calibre1">The white light that sped past caused the screams of the gods to explode. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A flash of instantaneous feet. The galloping roar that tore the wind to pieces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crimson threw his gaze down and simply looked ahead, bringing with him an even swiffer acceleration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At this moment, Bell's top speed did surpass Allen's speed limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The metropolitan maximum speed was completely pulled apart by the lower world maximum speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you fucking kidding me? Ahhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">World's fastest rabbit - [Rabbit foot]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen's boiling eyes filled with anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What a baffling situation! </p>
<p class="calibre1">What is this situation? It's completely incomprehensible! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment he entered the "escape" position, Bell's speed exploded...! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What's happening? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't know! BUT!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loki and Hermes jerked up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Go!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bert clenched his fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiona shook off her sister's (Tionne) restraint and clutched the 『Mirror』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「Bell!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ace shouted out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「Bell-kun!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p394"></a>Eina cried out loudly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「On </p>
<p class="calibre1">aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell-kun --------!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia sent the last of her solidarity (power) to the teenager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Receiving the mood of the goddess, Bell further increased his speed in order to secure victory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shit ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah! </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how much he cursed, he still couldn't catch up. Allen used all his strength and still couldn't reach his opponent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His arms were swinging hard, his stride was too wide, and the soles of his shoes were even raised to his thighs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And gradually far away from the back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The 'despair' that the fastest Allen had ever experienced hit the top of his vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, Lord Allen!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And Bell!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Noticing the sound of violent speeding, Freya's guards came outside in unison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They stepped down the long steps extending from the 'House of God' on the hill, and then were taken aback by the scene before them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「--! Rask, Remilia! Sing the spell!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The despair that hit him immediately turned into fury, and the fighting cat let out a roar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was about to reach the "House of God". Now that Bell was running faster than himself, the walls of the guards would be easily broken, and he predicted this and instructed them to shoot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「[Wheel of Gold, Collar of Silver]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen  surged  with  killing  intent  and  cursing  at  himself  for  giving  the  absurd instructions, but still surrendered his reserve. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though he would lose the duel, he shouted and started chanting in the sea of humiliation in order to win the war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Granzer Fromel]. The magic that made him ascend to the fastest speed of a true chariot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just by unleashing this, even Bell's back can be penetrated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「--[Carrying the divine will of the Goddess, go forward]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "House of God" was already within 50M. However, it was not too late. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p395"></a>For  the  sake  of  chanting,  Allen  slowed  down  his  speed,  but  still  wanted  to  sing </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Magic" and crush him to death with a single breath- </p>

<p class="calibre1">"[Burn it all away, Karma of Outer Law]" </p>

<p class="calibre1">In the next instant, he and the group all exploded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kah...? </p>

<p class="calibre1">Allan  and  all  the  guards  who  were  scrambling  to  prepare  their  magic  turned themselves into bombs. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic was out of control. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It wasn't that he couldn't control the magic power, but the outside made it forcefully out of control, and Allen spat out smoke, his posture collapsed, and was about to fall to the ground when he glanced at the source of the 『Yang-yeon』 that was released by avoiding the route of the teenager (Bell). </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Catch up, cluck ............ Lilly followers." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"House of God" opposite, the shadow of the crumbling shrine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The youth leaned his whole body against the pillar, but still stood there with one hand extended towards this way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Welf Clouzot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After his defeat to Allen, he was subjected to the communication of the eye crystal and was released by Hedin, the red-haired forger who crawled miserably forward before the sky was tinted with dusk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  winning  cause  that  made  him  succeed  in  reaching  the  teenager  (Bell)  was </p>
<p class="calibre1">[command want to call]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  "skill" that Lilly,  who became Lv. 2, revealed. Only the person  who has the same favor can sense from a distance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  island,  the  westernmost  side  of  ......  『House  of  God』,  the  nearby  ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">shrine, and the zone ............ have no one ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily told the thoughts of wishes and information to replace the broken eye crystal, sustaining the three together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Knowing the location information, and the time when Bell would come over, Welf was forced to catch the moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Your mood ............ to reach, cluck ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before becoming a commander, the forger already knew the thoughts of the young girl and responded to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p396"></a>With the strongest faction valve (Freya familia) as the opponent, the initial three's ties brought the chance to win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The cat that lost, just go to the side ......, okay? </p>
<p class="calibre1">On his sweaty face, Welf emerged with a rather exasperating smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the glow of the "magic sword" pulled out from his waist, Allen's whole body was really destroyed by anger this time, and at the same time, he yelled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You </p>
<p class="calibre1">lowlife </p>
<p class="calibre1">aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Welf, in turn, swung his weapon in reply. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Releasing a fierce fire to blow away all those who were in the way of the teenager. </p>







<p class="calibre1">Run non-stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Crossed  the  path  of  flames  created  by  his  partner  (Welf),  passed  by  the  fallen warriors, and came to the front of that huge dais. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then he ran up it in one breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya, on the other hand, stood frozen in front of the throne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was coming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenager was coming towards here. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The 『Love』 that the goddess sought in order to stop her 『Love』 was about to appear in the 『House of God』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--Syr-sama." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ta! With a sound, the teenager finished climbing the steps and appeared in front of the goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the name 『Girl』 called out from her mouth, Freya's face was distorted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no one left to protect the Queen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Warriors, villains, elfs, chariots, fierce people, all have been silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With the help of his companions, the teenager crossed all kinds of difficulties. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was hurt more than anyone else and finally reached 『her』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p397"></a>"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes met each other and a brief silence visited. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dusk sky wrapped around the wall of columns with the wind through it, as the alabaster light shone through the crumbling ceiling of the temple. Looking to the west, one would find the lake reflecting the light of dusk, shining like a fantasy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only a slightly chilly wind sounded, when Bell stepped out quietly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He stepped forward and approached Freya, whose shoulders trembled like a soft maiden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell--" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya smiled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "yoke of the goddess" was pushing her, trying to deny the situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The power of "beauty" that leaked out unintentionally made the edge of the god's eyes take on a light silver color, trying to "charm" him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, it did not stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell did not stop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  boy  who  would  never  be  charmed  by  the  goddess'  beauty  was  about  to eliminate  the  distance  between  them,  and  he  didn't  stop  when  the  distance disappeared and their 'love' would come to an end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya's smile cracked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her  shoulders  trembled  once  again  and  she  lowered  her  head,  a  strand  of  hair slipping down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Why?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A word fell on top of the stone floor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leaving less than ten steps behind, Bell stopped for the first time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--why!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya raised her face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why won't Bell be something of mine! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like a child having an epileptic seizure, her long silver hair danced wildly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She clutched her body, which was wrapped in white and coveted by everyone, and pressed her right hand, which was as watery as snow plaster, to her chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am Freya! Beauty, wealth, glory, power! I can give you everything, but why do you refuse my 'love'? </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was like an arrogant queen. Like a witch who curses a disobedient knight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What she wanted to say was not that, but the goddess who could not get anything but  her  own  name  and  power  revealed  her  ugliness  and  weakness  that  even seemed superficial. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The nakedness of her heart is revealed. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p398"></a>"Because the girl (Syr) did not succeed! That's why I chose the Goddess (Freya)!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Relying on the girl (Syr) was not going to work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So she had to turn back to the Goddess (Freya). </p>
<p class="calibre1">All she had was 'love', and she could only come up with that answer... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then, what do you think I should do! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya didn't notice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  fist  of  the  teenager  whose  expression  was  motionless  clenched  tightly  and shed blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess of love couldn't notice that the impulse that now made her let out a cry was exactly『』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「Why, you human ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice was trembling. The pupils were trembling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The God's eye with a silvery tint swayed between the light gray glow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... even I don't know anymore." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Now, I am most unsure of myself." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The confession (words) that she once heard somewhere, she uttered the follow-up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even after confessing the truth about me (in its entirety) ...... there is no liberation from this pain! Even whispering my 'love' to you will not feel relief at all!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell's face became crooked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a crack on the teenager's face that had been holding back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Deep in my chest, I have been saying to myself that the only thing I don't want to love is you!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She showed the conflict that had been hidden in her heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  didn't  want  to  admit  that  the  'love'  that  she  wanted  to  obtain  even  at  the expense of her friends (Ryuo) was useless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She could not accept that she was still crying in the "flower field" of her soul. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like a lost girl, she could only reach that thought. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"I love you, Bell ......" </p>

<p class="calibre1">Both hands clasped tightly in front of her chest, and her body leaned forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I like you so much. Want to be with you all the time. I hope you will choose me!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silver, and pale gray eyes became moist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm in pain! I want you to hold me so tightly! I don't want to worry about tomorrow anymore!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p399"></a>These pupils themselves did not understand why their eyes were filled with tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't want to know such things, but I still want to know what lies ahead of this feeling! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words were accompanied by heartbreaking wounds (selfishness) that shook the whole body of the teenager. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"I like you ...... Bell." </p>

<p class="calibre1">The teenager lowered his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He suppressed the sympathy and cries that seemed to spill out of the wretched wounds, and gushed out for them with the blood that couldn't stop trickling down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Stifling the shivering chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pulling back the unheard voices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The farewell can only reflect her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sky that had been obscured by dark clouds at that time is now so bright and beautiful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if the end of the two had been decided long ago, so fantastic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a world of only two people, Bell took a step forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I ...... will not be something for you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shock her wounds (selfishness) with her own wounds (selfishness). </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I will not! Become your 『Mate(Od)』!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were tears falling from her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">One at a time, he stripped his feet from the ground and advanced with the blood to stand in front of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He confessed to her the answer of hypocrisy (selfishness), and the 『』 that she had been seeking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The only thing that can be done is to end your 'love affair'! </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Love" was her "expectation". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The only way to save her is to hurt her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"----". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenager's hand gripped the dagger of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenager's arm swung upward bravely and sadly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The sound of 'Petal' swept past her ears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The blade did not touch her skin, and the 『flower petals』 on her chest flew in the air. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p400"></a>She looked up to the top of her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The eyes that shed tears looked at that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lilac flowers flew apart in the sienna sky. </p>


<p class="calibre1">Her "first love" also faded. </p>
