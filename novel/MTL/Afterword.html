<p class="calibre1">Afterword</p>

<p class="calibre1">This is the eighteenth volume that will be overtaken by the chariot without escape (ability). </p>

<p class="calibre1">Please allow me to express my gratitude in advance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The former editor-in-chief Kitamura, who left GA Bunko, has been working hard for you. And really thank you very much. We have worked together to make this work of the ground wrong until this eighteenth volume, and I will never forget this. The new editor-in-chief, Mr. Usami, please give me more advice from now on. I'm sorry for all the trouble I caused with the original manuscript again. This time also with excellent illustrations to add color to the work of ヤスダスズヒト teacher, one after another across the page illustrations, really surprised me. Thank you very much. I would  also  like  to  express  my  deepest  gratitude  to  everyone  involved  in  the publication. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I would also like to apologize to all readers. I'm really sorry that it took at least a year  and  a  half  since  the  17th  volume  was  released.  This  is  entirely  my responsibility. The number of pages was twice as many as I had planned, and it was all Omori Fujimino's fault that it became thick and heavy. Really, really made you wait a long time. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p417"></a>At the moment of writing this postscript, I have almost forgotten what I was thinking about when I wrote this article. Maybe I don't want to think about it. I thought I was going through such a painful battle, the same as the main characters. While I was thinking, 'Why was it so painful', I remembered, 'By the way, I've always wanted Goddess-sama to reach that 'field of flowers'. So, since I had a rare opportunity, I wanted to talk a little about Freya, the Goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the beginning, the first thing I did when I wanted to write this work on the ground was to consult all the myths I could find out, trying to understand the gods' lords. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the more I investigated, the more confused I became. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That book is not the same as the legends written on top of this one! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The intelligence was too scattered! It was all contradictory! </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, I was not accustomed to the act of reading books, nor did I have any prior knowledge related to mythology, so I was bleary-eyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The content of the different documents handed down varied, seemingly due to the historical background of the many peoples and countries, or to religion. I failed to understand this at the time, and just kept consulting books and the internet until I figured it out, and a few of the gods impressed me who knew nothing about them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was especially true of the goddess named Freya. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This god of great beauty was targeted by both enemies and companions, amorous and spirited, and at the same time a terrifying queen who would collect the souls of those  who died bravely in battle. I  feel that self-esteem is  also very  high, the heart should be strong to be invincible, even if the recklessness of the other party provokes anger, but also will say "so what? I'm Freya, right? That's how I see it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, it seems that such a goddess also shed tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When her husband named Odr left her, she went on a trip and searched for him everywhere, and was said to have cried because she couldn't find him at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is obviously the goddess of love, but does not know how to love? Or is it because she is the goddess of love that she despises love and forgets how important it is? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or is it that her feelings for her husband (Oded) are not love, but love? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just when I was thinking about such things, the Goddess Lord named Freya took an important place in this story along with the girl named Syr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the myths related to the Goddess Lord, there is a legend that I like very much. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p418"></a>The  goddess  who  met  her  husband  (Oded)  again  embarked  on  a  long  journey home, and on the way there seemed to be a large number of flowers blooming on the earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought that it must be a very beautiful field of flowers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wanted to reach that "field of flowers", so I wrote this story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,  I  felt  that  I  was  able  to  write  a  little  bit  about  what  it  would  be  like  after  I reached the field of flowers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The mythical legends are fragmented and full of contradictions, not telling us which is the correct interpretation. The gods are really unreasonable and impersonal. But that's the best kind of god, isn't it? Sometimes they cry like normal girls, don't they? </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, you are a god. Now, I think about it like that. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In this eighteenth volume, the fourth part from the twelfth volume, the long chapter that I call "The Book of Abundance" in my heart has finally come to an end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The next chapter will be a new one, "School District". </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  will  be  the  shortest  chapter  in  this  series.  After  that,  I  will  definitely  finish  this chapter in one go. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That said, there will be more than one volume, so I hope you can get your hands on the next volume as well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thank you very much for reading this far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'll leave you here. </p>
