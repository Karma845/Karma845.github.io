<p class="calibre1">"Anya." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How long are you going to do this?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm asking you, how long do you want to be depressed in bed! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Noah, calm down, meow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't stop me, Chloe! Anya, Freya-sama is Syr, right! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then even if we have to beat her up, we have to ask her what's going on!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Just join the Adventurers! Just join the Adventurers and bring Syr back! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Say something, you stupid cat!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p83"></a>"LUNOIA, CALM DOWN. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Get up! Or I'll drag you up...! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Noah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"! ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ We're off." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're just going to be depressed and rotten for the rest of your life!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door was opened with force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if in a display of the young girl's grief and anger, the whole room rattled, leaving the breath of two people. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anya. Meows are going to war games today meows." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And  bowed  down  and  asked  Lord  Njord  and  Lord  Demeter  to  get  the  other shopkeepers (Mae) to change their Familia as well." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ryu doesn't know about it. ...... But, meows are going to fight." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Anya, don't you want the tavern to go back to the way it was before? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I do hope so. ...... So, I'll go first." </p>
<p class="calibre1">So there was only one breath left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door was closed and Anya, crouched on the bed, clutched her knees. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa was good. Chloe is also very powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no way for Anya to fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elder brother (Aron) was scary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Goddess (Freya) was scary. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's not clear what happened to the girl who saved herself (Syr). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Couldn't even muster up the courage to find out about that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Runoa was right. Ania is still the same lost kitten that keeps on rotting away and one becomes nothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With disappointment in herself, Anya hung her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"- Hey." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p84"></a>The door was opened roughly, and someone approached the bed without a care in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rude tone was almost identical and very similar to that of the character she knew so well. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anya, whose face was buried between her knees, shook her shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--- ............ Brother-sama?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The lost kitten raised her head with trepidation. </p>




<p class="calibre1">A layer of white flames burned silently on the huge city walls that stood in the east. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling  the  sky  chasing  away  the  darkness  and  beginning  to  turn  white,  large sweat burst from my face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Heya-!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A split second later, this sweat and several hairs were blown away by the incredibly large twin blades that were exaggerated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My eyes widened and I held my breath, while my limbs didn't stop moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With my body in a position where I was leaning horizontally, I kicked the ground twice  like  a  dance  and  swung  the  White  Illusion  held  in  my  right  hand  with  the momentum of the pirouette. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hoo! </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  the  numerical  violence  woven  out  of  the  "Strength"  and  "Agility"  ability values. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At first glance, it seemed outrageous, and there was no way I could have done this before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But the ability called Lv. 5 made it a reality, combining evasion and attack in one. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's better not to be led by [Ability Value]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the opponent in front of him defeated this rampant power with a higher level of "no reasoning". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Using her amazing dynamic eyesight and guts, as well as the wrist strength of a female warrior (Amazon), she grabbed my right wrist, which was used to launch the attack, and threw it behind her back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo ----!? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only did I arc in the air, but I even bounced up again like a ball after landing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p85"></a>After  almost  being  slammed  into  the  ground,  I  hit  the  grass  growing  out  of  the ground  with  one  hand.  Using  the  reaction  to  forcefully  regain  my  posture,  while kicking the wall that was getting closer and closer, I jumped to the side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because at that moment another female warrior (Amazon) had already shaken and slashed with her long black hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're too monkey in the face of a thrown out break (decoy)! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......! Ahhhhh!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two reverse curved swords that kept flashing, and the big double blades that jumped high and fell from the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the face of the twin sisters' flurry of blows, I let out a shout from my dantian and attacked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The base of the [Hestia Familia] before dawn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't know how many times I've carried out the exercise with Tiona-sama and Tione-sama in this atrium. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a few days ago that the two of them suddenly came to the [Hall of Fires]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I heard "I want to help Agno-kun!  After that, I  accepted the  advice of  Mr. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn, who had applied to be Lily's "teacher", "Just let them accompany you for the adjustment", and have been fighting in the base until now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If I wanted to exercise, it would have been better to go to the huge wall like I was doing with Ms. Ace, or to the dungeon, but Tione-san pointed out that "it was a waste  of  time  to  go  back  and  forth  between  the  exercise  place  and  the  resting place (residence), and to prepare for the exercise," so we decided to  do  it right here in the center of the base. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We decided to do it right in the middle of our base. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The atrium is definitely not wide enough to allow the first level adventurers to make a fuss in it, the grass was dug up, the flowers and plants planted have become dilapidated, and even the pillars with  magic stone  lamps were broken. After the many repair costs will certainly make Lily descend the thunder of anger, but now I do not have the heart to take this into account. The consciousness is not qualified to think about other things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it was a workout, "fighting the first level adventurer" was, to put it bluntly, just that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"First the body! Then the mind! Otherwise you won't be able to keep up with the battles between the first level adventurers! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The attacks of Freya's Familia are even more fierce than that! </p>
<p class="calibre1">My hands and feet creaked with new injuries. Even the bone marrow was trembling and tingling. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p86"></a>The sharp strikes of the reverse blade and the heavy strikes of the large double blade shook me again and again as I passively defended myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whirlwind of attacks that can only be described as waves of fury kept pushing me into a desperate situation. Nearly 90% of my strikes were defeated, and only the ugly evasion was the last line of defense that kept me alive. I once delivered a cannonball kick that was so powerful that even I admired myself, but the result was an elbow that bounced off me so easily that I just felt like I was having a nightmare. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As first level adventurers, Tiona-san and the girls' experience and level were far superior to mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, this result is only natural. It was a logical result for Bell Cranel to be beaten up every day. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Think about you and Ace's workout!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Technique and strategy" should have been engraved into your hands and feet! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rip them out!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the words cast by Tiona-sama and Tione-sama kept stimulating the body and the heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">-- Don't be dragged along by [Ability Value]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">-- Don't be in a hurry to aim for a break. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way, this is all what that longing (that person) said to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now I'm Lv. 5, and because of that, I should find my first heart now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Connecting  values  (ability)  and  "skill",  combining  weapons  and  "strategy",  and resonating "vessel" with "heart"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's make it bigger - [Manabu Mallet]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the sound of "support" struck my bruised back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the corner of the atrium, Haruhime, who had been kneeling on the ground, stood up and finished her chant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She dripped a large amount of sweat similar to mine, squeezed out all her spiritual power, and granted a rank ascension. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「--!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  gripped  the  reins,  controlled  the  rapidly  rising  [Ability  Value],  and  struck  a counterattack. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the particles of light surrounding my entire body increased in speed, dazzling white and pitch-black daggers flashed in both hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By  using  "Technique",  I  hit  the  side  of  the  weapon  to  deflect  its  trajectory  and bounce off all of Tione-san's slashes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p87"></a>Then, he intentionally lured his opponent into attacking him by showing a gap with his "Strategy", and then swung the "Dagger of God" that he was holding in his left hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a desperate swing. It was truly a blow that was filled with everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiona-san  caught  it  head-on,  her  eyes  opened  and  she  smiled,  and  then  flew backwards with the Great Twin Blades. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The resulting impact shook the super-hard metal of the Big Twin Blades, making a crackling sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the first time I had heard such a soothing sound since the workout began. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It sounded like it was coming from a high-pitched tuning fork and spread through the atrium of the base. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey presto! ...... Agno-kun, how was it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Well. About, already." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiona-san, who spun in the air and landed easily, asked from some distance away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Breathing heavily, I sheathed the two daggers and opened and tightened my hands over and over again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「The『deviation』of feeling ...... is no longer there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Every time we ascend, we always create 'deviations of the flesh and spirit'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That is, the heart can't keep up with the body's ability to change too much. Perhaps because I haven't been an adventurer for too long, not mature enough, it always takes a long time to make up for the 『deviation』. In the Expedition two months ago, I fought with the lower most speedy (Shining Swallow) before it was finally resolved. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  the  purpose  of  this  exercise  was  not  to  train  for  the  purpose  of constantly pursuing to become stronger,  but to make "adjustments" to  eliminate the physical and mental "deviations" as Mr. Finn said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"At the end of the day, it finally took shape. That feeling of not being able to rely on it has disappeared. ...... You, too... I'm glad you're keeping up with us. I've heard the rumors many times, this demonic art is really powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Non, very, thank you~~~" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The smiling Tione-san is praising Haruhime-san, who is now likely to faint at any moment with her eyes spinning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to me, Haruhime-san had also completed her sublimation, and she had been involved in this "adjustment" since a few days ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her focus was on the adjustment of the level ascension rather than the physical action. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p88"></a>After becoming Lv. 2, the duration of fifteen minutes went up to twenty minutes, and  the  interval  needed  to  activate  the  next『Magic』was  shortened  from  ten minutes  to  nine  minutes.  Of  course,  the  maximum  number  of  『Tails』  also increased from five to six. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haruhime-san's power would undoubtedly be the key to the war games. Lily also said with bloodshot eyes after staying up all night, "Please keep experimenting at all times," so you don't have to worry about the lack of preparation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I also experienced an action that resembles Lv. 6, which is very critical ......) I just became Lv. 5 has a "deviation", if you add the effect of leveling up, it really may become a runaway bull, no kidding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact - although it's a strange metaphor  - the power of turning into a dragon is really quite tricky. It was only thanks to Tiona-san and the girls that I was able to master it completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm afraid that only Tiona-san, who is Lv.6, can simulate a battle against a first level adventurer  and  make  such  "adjustments".  I  can't  thank  them  enough  for  their kindness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If only Ace could have trained with Agno-kun and you guys. ...... I'm sorry, right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's  okay,  I  heard  that  she  has  her  own  situation,  and  I'm  sure  that  Aise-san  is cheering for me too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Talking about Aise-sama who is not here, I shook my head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although I don't know exactly what happened ...... but that person's teachings have been  rooted  in  my  heart.  I  got  her  help  in  this  exercise,  as  well  as  in  that </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Wilderness Battle』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, I will take her teachings with me and face the war today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... sunrise ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miss Haruhime looked upwards and said softly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if this was the atrium surrounded by the guildhouse, one could notice that the morning sun had revealed its face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, the sky was so red. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One could almost mistake it for dusk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Today is the third day of exercise. As well as the day of the war games. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Having  finally  arrived  at  this  fateful  day,  my  heart  first  became  calm  and  then suddenly beat violently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Agno-kun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without the slightest bit of excitement, I felt the uneasiness and tension that came from my heart and looked up at the sky just then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tiona-sama and Tione-sama came over and smiled at me and Haruhime-sama. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p89"></a>"Go for it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Punch that group of [Freya's Familia] out! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the sun-like  smiles and hearing the rough and painful words, Haruhime-sama and I looked at each other and felt saved at this moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We nodded, and then returned the smile with a share from Kami-sama and Lili and the girls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good! </p>



<p class="calibre1">This is the trail left by the giant named history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Several huge stone pillars that were lined up together and close to collapse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Countless faded stone slabs were laid underneath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The broken archway is tilted and still standing after a long period of time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  countless  remnants  resembling  tombs  and  shrine  dwellings  have  gradually been eroded by the bare ground and raised boulders, as well as scattered plants, and are now gradually becoming part of nature. The sight is quite majestic and at the same time somewhat silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is worth mentioning that this group of ruins is all on a lake. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is an island floating on the beautiful emerald lake, a huge depression surrounded by the steep Outer Wheel Mountains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Orza City Ruins'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The vast ruins built on the lake in the depression to the northwest of Orario, to the west of the "Beol Mountains", is also the name of the battlefield that will become the stage of this war game. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Its origin can be traced back to at least two thousand years ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a fortress city that fought against the demons that emerged from the "Big Hole". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Given  its  location,  there  was  no  shortage  of  water  in  the  first  place,  and  Lake Puddle also served as a natural moat to stop the invasion of monsters. It is said that  through  the  labor  of  half-elves  and  half-dwarves,  the  island  became  self-sufficient, and the city grew and survived until powerful monsters flew in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Now it is a deserted ruin, the whole island that encloses the edge of a distorted oval, with a row of walls and towers of the remains. Among the uneven land, many sloping and completely crumbling back buildings can be seen everywhere, even after a long time, still depicting the appearance of a town under the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p90"></a>One of the remains at the west end of the island, which is larger than the others, is a 'temple'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the "ancient times" before the coming of the gods, people living under the strong threat of demons worshiped the gods and sought salvation. In the land of Orza, which also had a deep connection with the "elves", people called this temple the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"House of Gods" and enshrined more than one statue of the gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among the objects of their faith, there is also the goddess of beauty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"A cold wind was blowing and clouds were visible everywhere, but as you can see, the sky was clear and clear! I think it will be a good day for war in the mountain battlefield  where  the  weather  is  fickle!  Good  morning  and  noon,  everyone!  This time, I am also in charge of announcing the war games, the talking fire magic Imboli Achar,  who  belongs  to  the  Ganesha  Familia!  The  following  is  omitted  from  the name "Flame Burst Flame"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I am Ganesha! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The narration is still by Ganesha-sama..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the land  of  Orario, which is far away,  the scene of the Orza ruins group was shown in the "mirror". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Mirror of the Gods" was set up to observe the distant area, and the two of them were giving a live commentary under the leadership of the city gendarmes (Ganesha Familia). </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, unlike the war game with the Apollo Familia held five months ago, the city was quiet as if it had forgotten what frenzy was. The adventurers sitting in the tavern came to the avenue to look up at the 『Mirror』 heavy duty, including the gods assembled in the skyscraper, and all of them showed a nervous look even before the battle started. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So so so-! This time it was a special case in the Orario, the "Faction War"! The </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Freya Familia], which is regarded as the strongest in the city, will fight against the allied forces led by the [Hestia Familia]! And this time the theme, not the right kind is - Searching for God! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The only people who were making a lot of noise were the two people in charge of announcing and commentating. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the vestibule of the main office, the announcer, Ibri, was holding a megaphone made of magic stones in one hand and shouting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please allow me to omit the detailed rules! The first one to find the gods is the winner! Each [Familia] has hidden the main god in the ruins of Orza City, and the Familias are responsible for finding it! This is a real game of hide-and-seek! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is this ...... Ganesha?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p91"></a>"As Ganesha-sama said, this is not a mere hide-and-seek! It's a big battle where you can either hinder or fight when you encounter the enemy's familia! In order to protect the gods and find the opposing gods, there will be many rivers of blood and countless graves of weapons! </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not a metaphor. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter what the rules are, the battle that awaits them in this "Great War", in which forty-seven [Familias] are participating and over eight hundred Familias are fighting, will definitely be a blood-for-blood battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When they heard Ilta's explanation, the people, without exception, drew a breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But-! The [Freya Familia] must find all the rival gods, and the only condition for the victory of the allied forces is the discovery of the god Freya! I feel that this is too much in favor of the allied forces, and I don't think it's fair! What is your opinion on this point, Lord Ganesha? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Honestly, I can't say that I'd give up any more than that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Here's a serious response from Ganesha-sama! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice of the live commentary, which was so different from the atmosphere of the city, resounded all around, and the people who remained in Orario had a variety of expressions at their respective locations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell-kun ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eina ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the guild headquarters near the ceiling where "Mirror" was floating, Eina, who could only pray, was suffering from anxiousness, and her colleague Micaiah was gently clinging to her like that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Under this rule, the Almighty (me) can not only fly in the air to find the location of the gods, but even launch surprise attacks to end the war (game), so it must be prohibited from appearing ...... is that so? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Flying boots to be  exact,  that's it. There were some guys  who knew  about this magic prop that flies in the air before, but because of that incident where you broke into  Freya-sama's  base  with  Hestia,  it  became  a  well-known  fact.  ......  still  can't accept it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Now that things have come to this point, it's useless to make any more noise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition to the forbidden flying boots, other magic props have been provided to Liliruca Arde. ...... can only trust him, and them, now." </p>
<p class="calibre1">''On  the  thirtieth  floor  of  the  Tower  of  Babel』,  Asfi,  who  was  mixed  among  the other gods, frowned, while Hermes shrugged his shoulders. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ace, I know you're probably in pain, but ...... shall we watch it together?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ Hmm." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p92"></a>In the base of [Loki's familia], Ace, whose hand was held by Tiona, raised her face that had been lowered and walked into the living room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tionne who was sitting on the bench, Gareth whose rock-like arms were resting on his chest, Rivelia who had one eye closed, and Finn who was licking his fingers were all gazing at the 『Mirror』 left by the main god (Loki). </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were only a few moments left before the battle started. </p>





<p class="calibre1">"Good Wide ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I murmured in the face of the group of ruins that I couldn't see in detail even with the eyesight of an upper level adventurer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"On the east side is our "Allied Forces" position ...... and on the west side is [Freya's Familia], right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's right ....... That largest ruin is the center, and that's the dividing line between the two sides." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naza, who was holding a longbow, explained to me who had just arrived. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the corner of Gaiwansan where you can see the "Orza City Ruins" in full view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the top of the cliff, you can see the full view of Lake Puddle, which is a great view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If I hadn't been in this situation and had come here for sightseeing, I wouldn't have been able to stop sighing at the blue glow of the lake, which was transformed into the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  the  second  time  I  came  to  "Beale  Mountain".  This  place  called  "Beor Depression" is located on the west side of the sea, and it is completely opposite to </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Adace Village" where Kami-sama, I and Ais-sama got lost and entered during the invasion of the kingdom army. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's  surprising  that  a  place  that  is  not  too  much  of  a  burden  for  an  upper  level adventurer,  which  is  only  a  few  hours  away  with  Haruhime-sama  on  your  back, has such a spectacular view. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It  is  said  that  [Freya's  Familia]  has  entered  the  ruins  this  morning  .......  The Goddess-sama is probably hidden by them somewhere on the west side ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p93"></a>I looked in the direction pointed out by Naza-sama who was standing on the cliff, only  to  see  the  remains  of  a  huge  half-destroyed  shrine  in  the  exact  spot  that bisected the battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rules specify the zone where the two main gods hide, with the allied forces on the east side and [Freya's Familia] on the west side, and it is possible for the god lord to hide anywhere as long as it is within the zone. Whether there is a tower next to the edge or an uncovered central area. This urban ruin is so big that it could easily accommodate a section of the Maze City, and I was afraid that it would be quite troublesome to find a pillar of gods here, and I began to make this mental preparation when I came to inspect the battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But, I really didn't expect to play war games in such a vast ruin ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There are nearly 50 [Familiasmen] participating, so it's reasonable to say that ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I came to scout what Mr. Ouka said, then Naza-san helplessly pressed the hair caught by the wind, so the response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "urban ruins" floating on the huge lake - so to speak, it's a bit like I learned it from Ouka-san - is also like a complete world itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The city that was once a fortress has become a battlefield, and today we are going to fight against the most powerful enemy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Thank you very much. That's enough. Let's go back." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I controlled my tension and turned around together with Ouka-san and Naza-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I walked down the long steep slope and returned to 『Camp』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was only one bridge on the south side of the "Orza City Ruins" located south of Lake Puddle, and on the other side of the bridge was the "camp" of the allied faction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was said that except for me and Haruhime-san, who had exercised until the last moment, many other adventurers had entered the tent group set up by the guild and the [Ganesha Familia] a few days ago - by the way, it seems that the [Freya Familia] had entered the urban ruins by crossing the lake from the north side of the lake of the depression in a small boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the war game started, this "camp" would become a "first aid office" for treating the wounded who had retired from the battlefield, and members of the [Dian Cecht Familia] could be found everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I feel like I don't have enough props ....... Hey, does anyone have any spare ones! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The [Miach Familia] is all set! Go get them from the God of Boys! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's  like  a  dream  to  get  a  share  of  Crozzo's  Magic  Sword  and  Hephaestus' </p>
<p class="calibre1">weapons. ...... But I can't stop thinking about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "camp" was very noisy. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p94"></a>The sounds of excitement and nervousness were flying overhead incessantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dwarves put on heavy equipment with the help of their companions. As I was silently looking at the battle that was sure to come, someone spoke to me from behind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell Cranel!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah ...... Mr. Luvis, Mr. Dormul!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Turning back, I only saw a group of people I had seen before running towards me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was Luvis-san of the Modi Familia and Dormul-san of the Magni Familia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elves and dwarves fought together with the reinforced species (moss giants) at the time of the lower level "Expedition". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Would you like to fight together ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Naturally. This life should have been taken away along with my right arm, but you saved me. If I don't repay this great kindness now, what better time to do so? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Luvis, who was carrying a quiver and arrows, gently touched his "right arm". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The arm that was wrapped in the battle suit and gloves must be the same as Naza-san's Silver Hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Luvis-san, who had lost one arm, had the clean smile of an elf on his face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was time to fulfill the vow. Let's fight together, allies of the elfs." </p>
<p class="calibre1">--I swear by the name of Luvis Lilinx that I will repay such a great kindness in the future. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I remembered the words Luvis-san said to me at "Riviera Street" after defeating the  enhanced  species.  Behind  him,  Lana-san,  who  was  standing  firmly  on  the ground with her righteous feet, also smiled the same way. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What an ally of the elfs! If you say so, then our comrades (Hestia's familia) are our brothers! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Dormul shouted and interjected. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He didn't care about Mr. Luvis' reproachful gaze and pounded his fist on the thick chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We  have  not  forgotten  that  time.  Although  the  other  side  is  very  unbeatable, but ...... for you guys, let's fight to the end, brother." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing Mr. Dormul who was with his companion and smiling to himself, I got a little choked up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  two  had  a  strange  encounter  with  me  because  of  Eina-san,  and  after  that helped each other in the dungeon, and now they are about to fight side by side like this. It would be fine if it was simply attributed to a wonderful destiny. But the fact that the initial encounter continued to flow, and that the Luvis-san's were helping </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p95"></a>each other like this, made my chest swell with gratitude for that encounter from the bottom of my heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was good! Very much..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey! Don't forget we're here too, [Rabbit foot]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo! </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, a thick arm wrapped around my neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I coughed and looked over in a panic, only to see the cunning smile of the former adventurer in front of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Mr. Moore, Mr. Mord! Is everyone else here too?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of  course!  After  all,  if  we  win  against  the  Freya  Familia,  we'll  get  the  gold  and silver  they've  saved  up!  It's  enough  for  me  to  have  a  good  time  at  the  Grand Casino! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even at this time, Mr. Mord was doing his usual thing, and I smiled bitterly as he put his arm around my neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A  step  away,  Mr.  Guile  and  Mr.  Scott  shook  their  heads  "oops  oops  oops"  ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">what does this mean? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... You seem to be ready too." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Mord let go of his arm and looked down at my body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  defense  was  the  sixth  generation  rabbit  armor  built  by  Welf,  as  well  as  the brand new battle suit without any smell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The weapons were the usual "Dagger of God" and "White Illusion". The Goliath Scarf was wrapped around his neck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Three  double-attribute  recovery  pills  were  inserted  in  the  leggings,  as  well  as  a precious item developed by Miss Naza, the Allspice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I once again glanced at the armor that I had put on before inspecting the battlefield and nodded in response. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To win, [Rabbit foot]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Yes!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  I  saw  Mr.  Mord's  smile,  which  was  not  that  of  a  scoundrel,  but  of  an adventurer, I also responded with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All gods and dependents gather! Let's share the information at last!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just as we were united by our different factions, Hestia-sama's voice rang out from deep within the camp. I nodded to each other with Naza-sama, Ouka-sama, Luvis-san, and Mord-san, and walked over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were only two hours left before the start of the battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the last curtain break before waiting for the judge (Ganesha familia) to give the order to enter the battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p96"></a>In front of the tent in the middle of the camp, the crowd was looking at Lord Hestia, in the forefront were the gods and goddesses as well as our chief, and behind them were Welf and Aisha-sama and the girls, many adventurers and forgers, and battle whores in a semicircle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"First of all, you gods take a 'flower' placed here. Make sure to put it in front of your chest, don't hide it! This is an instruction from the [Ganesha familia]." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gods took one of the flowers on the table in turn, just as Hestia-sama had said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord Kinomori took the purple chrysanthemum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Miach-sama took the mallow with leaves and flowers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hephaestus-sama took the pale red iris. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddesses who hated the goddess of beauty, the male gods who cried out that they were finished, and the male gods who laughed dryly, put the flowers on their chests with different expressions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The detailed rules have been set at the divine meeting, and all the gods should already  know  ......  If  any  god's  'flower'  is  snatched  by  the  other  god's  Familia (children) or lost! Please don't forget that this god will be considered defeated! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Does  that  mean  that  even  if  the  gods  of  ......  are  discovered,  they  are  not immediately  defeated,  but  can  continue  the  game  as  long  as  they  still  have  the flower in their hands? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's right, Mord! For the gods, the only targets for the families (children) are the flowers!  But,  if  the  main  god's  flowers  are  taken  away,  the  [families]  will  exit together, so all gods please escape to the end or resist to the end! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia-sama  answered  Mord-san's  question,  while  sticking  a  red  fragrant  snow orchid to her chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is a major premise that the inhabitants of the lower world regard it as taboo to hurt or kill the gods and goddesses. It is said that this 『Flower Grabbing』 is a rule prepared for this purpose. It is forbidden to directly attack a god lord, and in case a god is caught in a shell of 『magic』 - mistakenly returning the god - the </p>
<p class="calibre1">[familia  member]  is  immediately  disqualified.  This  is  to  prevent  someone  from going out of their way to force out the gods by bombarding the entire relic at the beginning of the battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The [Freya Familia] is going to steal the flowers from Hestia-sama and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And our ultimate goal ...... is to snatch the flower that that person is holding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How is the scope of resistance calculated when I failed to confirm each of them at the gods' meeting? Can I counterattack?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Releasing  divine  power  is  not  possible,  and  Freya's  power  ......『Charm』is naturally prohibited, but ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p97"></a>"What is the calculation for the ...... God of War (Jian)? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing  the  question  of  Lord  Takemikazuchi,  Lord  Hephaestus  showed  a  very subtle expression, and the back of Lord Hestia's head also oozed a large sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  things  that  the  gods  and  goddesses  are  in  charge  of  ......  to  Lord Takemikazuchi is that 『Wu』 is indeed considered a prolongation of resistance, or I don't know to what extent it should  be prohibited ...... Anyway, it feels like a very delicate line. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... by the way, if the opponent is Freya's children, you can fight into what? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No  more  than  a  second  level  adventurer  can  shake  off  twenty  people,  the  first level, then, is one." </p>
<p class="calibre1">""Will you go to the front line and fight."" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Takemikazuchi-sama  answered  Hestia-sama's  question  as  usual,  and  the  male gods (Modi) adults said hatefully as if they had seen something incomprehensible and disgusting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Our faces twitched a bit, while Ouka-san and Mikoto-san proudly puffed out their chests. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Forget it, forget it, let's assume that you can resist within the scope of not being considered a foul ....... As for the most important  『fabricated formation』...... is also the matter of where the gods are going to hide." </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, the re-energized Hestia-sama turned back to look behind her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a 『Chief Commander』 figure there, standing on the wooden box, she kept looking down at the parchment spread on the large table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--The center of the "United Faction Army" was the [Hestia Familia]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the leader or the person in charge of command must also be a member of Hestia-sama's Familia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Regardless of the Lv. 5 leader (me), when she first became the commander, there was no shortage of opposition. But now, finally, no one has any objections. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like the "brave one of the Familia", she showed her calm, lake-like face and kept gazing at the unfolding map of the ruins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before  I arrived at this camp, Lily had been looking  down on  the battlefield and formulating a plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............『Arrangement』will be left to the gods-sama to decide. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't know if she had finally organized her thoughts, or if she had succumbed to the time limit that had come. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No  longer  confused,  Lilly  raised  her  head  and  took  in  the  many  eyes  that  were looking at her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p98"></a>"If  Lili  carried  out  the  configuration  alone,  she  would  be  seen  by  the  other  side through the formation to see through her side's focus. The opponent will definitely see through where all the gods are hiding. Therefore, Lily wants to separate her intentions and the place where the gods and goddesses are lurking." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Ahhh, I see. Supporter-kun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one felt that she had given up her duty so quickly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lilly calmly saw the enemy's ability and even the omniscient gods and goddesses adults intended to make use of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The little human girl was standing beside the nodding Hestia-sama, when only a shoo~ was heard. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A column of unnamed male gods-sama whistled pleasantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everyone, there is one thing to be stated in advance. The enemy's commander is very smart. Much smarter than Lili. If we prepare ten ploys, nine of them will be defeated by him, and the last one will be used as a trap to count against us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  words  that  Lily,  who  was  looking  around  at  the  adventurers,  said  were definitely not an exaggeration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The enemy's commander-in-chief is in all probability the [White Demon Wand]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That white elf who has been exercising me, is also my master, Hedin Selander. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I especially know how sensible he is, how reasonable he acts, and how cold he is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tough warriors also need not be said. Although we are now strong, if it is a head-to-head conflict, we will definitely lose. This is Lilly, our enemy, [Freya's familia]." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lilly Luka ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To be honest, if it wasn't for this situation, Lilly really wanted to run far away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing Lily reveal her judgment, her true heart, and even her weak side, Daphne-san murmured worriedly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With an illusory expression, Lily lowered her head for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But--Lily wants to win." </p>
<p class="calibre1">And yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When  she  raised  her  head  again,  the  light  in  her  awakened  eyes  was breathtakingly intense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I  want  to  beat  up  Freya-sama  ......  who  has  done  something  unforgivable,  but more importantly, Lily doesn't want to be separated from Bell-sama! Lilly will never hand over Lilly to our important people! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the voice that poured in huge heat, Miss Mikoto and Haruhime-san's eyes widened, and Welf also cocked the corners of his mouth. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p99"></a>Daphne-san  and  Cassandra-san  were  startled,  Aisha-san  and  Mord-san  they showed a brave smile, Ouka-san and Chigusa-san they nodded in response, and Naza-san, Luvis-san and Dormul-san narrowed their eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Give me your power, adventurers!!! Lily is here to lead you to victory!!!" </p>

<p class="calibre1">said out loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words were spoken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Put this vow that there was no way back, but to win. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the next instant, the adventurers exploded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo hoo! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The roar of the people, each raising their weapons high in the air, overlapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The loud sound that shook the sky, provoked by a girl, caused Hestia-sama next to Lily to lean back and almost fall down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay! Let's do it then!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After all, it's all said by the little human brats! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The name of the Amazon has been disgraced! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The morale of the adventurers, who were fighting against the tension, anxiety and terror, was overwhelmed by a fierce battle spirit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, Lilly is a good woman! I'm sorry I laughed at you earlier for being a little bit! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Next naming convention, let's call it [My-Little-Lover]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I have to look good too, to show Lily Taso! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not only the Familia, but also the gods, who were known for their unpredictable temperaments, were energized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The camp that was instantly surrounded by heat took me by surprise. ...... But it was only for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't know it, but my cheeks were slightly red and I was smiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The opportunity to give orders was robbed ah ...... Chief General." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ahaha ....... But, I think that's fine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naza-san showed a mischievous smile and whispered in my ear, and I returned a bitter smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It would be redundant to send out encouragement that was not in my style, and as the  head  of  the  group,  it  would  undoubtedly  be  a  disgrace  ......  but  I  was  very happy. The degree of happiness can no longer be described in words. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p100"></a>This  first  time  to  form  a  team  of  『partner』,  once  so  annoying  adventurers supporters girls, but now like this to shake so many people, bathed in cheers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--She was really like a "brave man". </p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought to myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although I am not qualified to judge anything, I feel proud of myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, Lord Bell ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The frenzied adventurers left the front of the tent one by one, busy with their final preparations,  while  I  went  to  Lily  and  Kami-sama's  side.  Having  completed  the initial task of 『motivation』, Lily, who was just about to sigh, smiled sheepishly as soon as she saw me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">「Lily, you're great. Really ...... it's like looking at Finn-sama." </p>
<p class="calibre1">「This  is  all  instilled  in  me  by  Finn-sama.  "First  use  the  cute  appearance  that  I don't  have,  act  meek,  and  then  use  wild  words  to  ignite  the  crowd  in  one breath" ...... He said that doing so would definitely be to the adventurers' liking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily  is  still  embarrassed  to  say  the  secret  of  it,  "That  adult  is  really  particularly cunning, not at all like the 'brave'", and then evaluates Mr. Finn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  also  laughed  at  her.  At  the  same  time,  I  also  felt  that  Lily  was  very  reliable nowadays. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(...... If it was the current Lily, I should be able to tell her.) I should say what I've been thinking about. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I should say the "what if" that I have been feeling, which is different from the sense of dissonance, and maybe just ridiculous. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lily ...... can you listen to something? </p>

<p class="calibre1">White  clouds  crossed  the  Sea  of  Blue  Sky  together  with  the  sound  of  wind  and headed to the east. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the center of the camp, after the other adventurers and the gods and goddesses had completely left. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  Welf  and  I,  them,  and  Aisha-sama,  the  people  who  had  been  on  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">『expedition』  together,  were  left  here,  and  after  hearing  me  out,  Lily's  brow furrowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After all, this is what Lord Bell said, so Lily is not suspicious ...... But, Lily still can't accept it all. Lilly thinks that the possibility of 『that kind of thing』 happening is extremely low." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well, that's fine. I also think Lily is right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As long as it stays in her heart for a while, it's fine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I asked her to do so, Lily smiled and said, "I see," and nodded her head. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p101"></a>Maybe  I  shouldn't  say  something  strange  to  disturb  the  commander  who  is responsible for the whole battle. In fact, until just now, I was thinking that way, so I didn't want to say anything about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Lily grew up more significantly than I did, so I decided to trust her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then, that ...... I also want to say a few words, is that okay ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just then, Cassandra-san, who was holding a long staff, cautiously spoke up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What, Cassandra. You're not going to say your『dream』again, are you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ooooooooo  ......  Little  Daphne,  obviously  I  was  believed  in  the  『Lower Level』 ...... Surely you still don't approve of the content of precognitive dreams (dreams)~" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daphne-san looked over sharply, causing Cassandra-san to squirm with tears in her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought of helping her out and asked a question. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Uh, did you see the dream again?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, yes ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What kind of dream?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I, I don't really want to say ...... it seemed like there was no way back and no way to hide from ...... the dusk-colored earth with such and such things happening ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">elfs and prum and they ...... boars and chariots they ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the contrary, it is more concerning ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">The iron face, desperately blurred wording of the body makes me cold sweat, just then, the eyes wandering Miss Cassandra seems to have decided, said: "But there will be wind blowing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But the wind will blow." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said this to me with a straight gaze, and at that moment, what I felt was not surprise, but astonishment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The wind, is it ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What happens when the wind blows over?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I, I don't know ...... but, there will be wind blowing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haruhime-san slightly tilted her head, Aisha-san asked as if looking at something suspicious, but Cassandra-san just repeated the same words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daphne-sama and the girls sighed, feeling helpless, while I tilted my head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"O wind ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Under the shining sun, a light wind dragged the clouds in the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Start lowering the bridge now! Send the valve allies to set up in the defined area!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">One hour before the start of the battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p102"></a>At  the  call  of  the  [Ganesha  Familia]  leader,  Shakti,  the  guild  staff  and  corps members retreated from the bridge leading to the 『Orza Metropolitan Ruins』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing this action, the allied adventurers who were waiting anxiously in front of the camp ran in unison. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dwarves  with  war  hammers,  elf  magicians  with  long  staffs,  forgers  with  "magic swords" in their arms, and battle whores responding to the call of their eldest sister (Aisha), all scrambled to the location designated by their commander (Lily). </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then  again,  what  a  surprise,  Bors.  You're  actually  going  to  participate  in  this battle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shut up, [One-Eyed Giant Master]! I'll fight when I have to! ............ lied to you. I would never have come ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic sword-resistant Tsubaki spoke up to talk, and Bors, who also resisted the big ax, first returned with bravado, and immediately became blue in the face, feeling ready to cry out in pain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I was planning to stay at the Labyrinth Hotel Street (Riviera) and not come out! </p>
<p class="calibre1">But that stupid goddess of ours said something stupid about making the goddess of beauty (Freya) look good, and she joined the war ......! As a result, I was forcibly dragged out!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ooh. Is that really all?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... No, it's not. If it wasn't for [Rabbit foot] and [Blast], my lord would have burped a long time ago. I'd like to pay back the favor before it becomes a problem. This is the style of the Maze Inn Street (Riviera). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  footsteps  of  countless  adventurers  running  in  stride  made  the  wide  stone bridge  shake,  and  the  street  of  the  Maze  Inn,  where  the  teenagers  (Bell)  were caught in the disaster, was full of excuses. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hahahaha! I'll have to show my manhood then! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's not true! I'm going to win and get all the money and fame! Even if it's just to show off in front of the cowards who didn't come to fight, I have to win! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Bors's final self-loathing shout, Tsubaki laughed out loud and just crossed the  bridge  and  immediately  chose  the  path  in  another  direction.  The  other adventurers also followed their example and gradually dispersed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There were no parting words. They all knew very well that as long as they thought of the enemy that awaited them, no matter how carefully prepared and how tearful the words would not be of the slightest comfort. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Deep in the forest ruins, there are even basements. There are so many places to hide that people worry that they won't find us. When playing hide-and-seek, people can't find themselves, but it's as empty as the sunset stinging your eyes ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p103"></a>The  gods  also  crossed  the  bridge  and  searched  for  their  hiding  places  in  the defined eastern domain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  gods  also  crossed  the  bridge  and  searched  for  their  hiding  places  in  the eastern  side  of  the  domain.  "Stop  talking  nonsense  and  decide  where  to  hide, Hestia. If the main gods are caught before the children, it will be difficult. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know, I know! I'm a great hide-and-seeker in heaven, and the other gods even consider me a rarity. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is the first time I've heard of this. ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Isn't it because you've been hiding in the temple that no one has found you?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first time I've heard of this is the first time I've heard of it. The gods who had sent the valve alliance, accompanied by a few guards, considered the movements of the other gods and settled on a lurking place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The adventurers, and all the gods, have all crossed the bridge! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Good,  block  the  bridge!  Iltar,  you  will  monitor  the  vicinity  of  the  shore  as scheduled! </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the gods crossed the bridge, the [Ganesh Familia] sealed the bridge again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Orza City Ruins" - the huge island is located in the south of Lake Puddle. The only way to enter the ruins is to take this bridge that extends to the south side, and even  if  you  want  to  swim  across  the  lake,  you  can't  escape  the  eyes  of  the gendarmes that are evenly deployed on the four sides of the shore. In other words, even if someone intervenes, or if monsters and third forces appear, it is impossible to invade the ruins as long as they cannot break through the Lv. 4 second level that the [Ganesha Familia] is proud of, and the Lv. 5 first level adventurers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unless  all  the  『flowers』  of  the  gods  on  either  side  were  broken,  the  steel encircling  net  that  Shakti  and  the  girls  had  established  -  the  『battle』  itself  in which many 【families】 were involved would never end. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Freya-sama." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the western part of the urban ruins, inside the [Freya's Familia] formation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar, dressed in his outfit, approached Freya, who was sitting on a stone throne. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is it, Ottar? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The guild has finally delivered the『Flower』. Please carry it on your chest." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This object is made up of a collection of tiny petals. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is the banner that determines the victory or defeat of the war game, and it is also the key. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The flower he handed over was a lilac flower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... is really ironic." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p104"></a>Looking at the beautiful purple flower, Freya showed a self-deprecating smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......? What does this mean?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No, it's nothing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya took the flower and put it on her chest. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was not wearing her usual black flame-like dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead, it was an elegant and pure white dress, like a bride's wedding dress. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A white goddess, as if to cut off all her attachment, said to the boar attendant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Win it, Ottar." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We must get Bell. This is the only way left." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... obey!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Takeshi just nodded his head in response. Every time, he only nodded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was only one purpose, to fulfill his master's divine will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">".................." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The red coral colored eyes with a hint of crimson looked in that direction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The long golden hair fluttered in the wind, and Hedin stared at the goddess with an unchanging expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why are you standing here, maggot?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Shut up, stupid cat. I'm just deciding on my loyalty." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin  didn't  even  look  at  Allen,  whose  left  shoulder  was  wrapped  in  a  silver shoulder pad and one-shoulder cape, and turned his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned his back to his master, pushed down his glasses with one hand, and announced. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This loyalty will be dedicated to that lord. --At my command, noble goddesses." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The commander's voice rang out from the huge structure, and the strong warriors roared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The roar that the green lake of the grandmother trembled was a clarion call for war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The Battle of the End (Twilight of the Gods).................. is about to begin. Ah ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The black elf clutched the scabbard and the pitch-black longsword in it and spat out a timid voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's coming." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's coming." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The identical voices of the prum quadruplets were joined together and the sand-colored helmets were put on. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p105"></a>"Quickly. The same thing should be done. --Just crush it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allen gripped his silver lance, wrapped in a quiet murderous aura. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please  assist  me  when  the  battle  begins,  Lorna,  Ilde.  If  the  barbarians  who harmed the Goddess appear, I will become inhumane." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Understood! Lord Haydée!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  healers  and  pharmacists  known  as  the  Cinderella  with  a  full  stomach straightened their postures as if in awe of the maiden sitting on the rubble with her eyes closed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Come, favored children of the goddess." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  pigman  wujin  left  the  goddess's  side,  focusing  on  just  one  teenager,  and whispered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's get started, Bell." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Well ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">And </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the warriors shouting from the west, the red-haired youth and the white-haired boy clenched their fists. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So! War Games! It's on! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hour and minute hands looked up at the sky and coincided with each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the labyrinth city across the mountains, the Bell rang out, and the signal for war hit the sky. </p>

<p class="calibre1">VS. [Freya Familia]. Battle form (category) - Hide-And-Seek. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The victory condition was the capture of the "Flower of the Gods". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The largest war game in the history of the world had never been played before, and the curtain opened at this time. </p>







<p class="calibre1">The name "Orza City Ruins" was true to its name. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The total area of this huge ruin, built on the lake, was large enough to encompass the entire district of Olalee. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  other  words,  even  though  nearly  fifty  factions  were  mixed  in,  it  was  still impossible to fill it up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p106"></a>The one who included this relic as a candidate for the battlefield - and also the one the guild sought advice from - was [Hermes Familia]. This swiftly touring ruin is a touring  expedition  to  collect  『Ancient』  intelligence  and  secret  treasures  by neutral faction valves of the Lord God's interest as well. In the metropolitan ruins, the historical materials of the ancient period had been recycled and now became an 『empty shell』, and that was one of the reasons why it was recommended as a battlefield for the 『faction valve war』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The half-destroyed stone pillars that are bathed in sunlight and create shadows as well as the walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The many statues of overhead gods that had lost part of their faces and arms and were silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The roofs and even the walls have disappeared from the old site of the Great Bath, where rainwater has accumulated over the years and has now turned into a wide and clear spring. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ruins are littered with clusters of Lune monuments carved with gun-wielding gods or giant wolves. These precious stones of cultural value have been damaged by monsters and can no longer be successfully deciphered. The tombs were also robbed by thieves of the jewels that accompanied them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A symbol of demise and decline. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The solemnity of history and the silence of being forgotten by the times were placed at the two ends of the scale and could not stop swaying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Adventurers glanced at such a scene, and immediately averted their eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  formerly  prosperous  and  destroyed  capital  city  would  now  be  turned  into  a place of fierce battle again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are there any enemies?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No. They don't seem to be approaching the east-west boundary yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then report to base camp! Let's move!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  adventurers  belonging  to  the  coalition  of  factions  were  moving  one  after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A large number of "scouts", led by the elfs led by Luvis of the Modi Familia and the orcs, were put into the urban ruins. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No enemy has been found on the southeast side, Sir Lily. I don't think they have reached the eastern side of the territory yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Understood, Lord Mikoto. Please leave this area to the defense team and continue to the west. Then investigate the ruins built on the road ahead. If it's Lili, we'll send troops to control it first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"『Understood! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p107"></a>Lilly gave instructions to the crystal that sent out the voice of the order. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was the eastern side of the ruins that belonged to the territory of the allied faction of warlords, almost in the middle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the old market place where the roots of countless pillars were lined up, Lily had set up a futile base camp. </p>

<p></br></p>



<p class="calibre1">Several crystals, or 'eye crystals', were placed on top of the roots of the pillars as thick as tree roots.
<p class="calibre1">Coincidentally, it was also very much like the 'command post' that Hestia had built at the top of the tower during the Labyrinth Street attack and defense battle. She spread out the map of the ruins, listened to the reports of the troops through the eye crystal, and smoothly issued one instruction after another.
<p class="calibre1">"Lilly, Lilly-san ...... has been in constant contact since a while ago, are you okay?
<p class="calibre1">"The rest of you are fighting monsters like the [Freya familia]. I don't think Lilly, who is not capable of fighting, should be screaming because of this little thing!
<p class="calibre1">Seeing several eye crystals glowing again and again, the voice of the adventurers came, and Chigusa, who was acting as an escort, asked as if her dizziness was unbearable, but Lily didn't even look at the other party, she just concentrated on taking notes.
<p class="calibre1">Although it is the "base camp", there are only two people in this old market site, Lili and Chigusa.
<p class="calibre1">After all, the hidden gods must also be protected, there is no way to divide more people to serve as Lily's escort.
<p class="calibre1">If Lily falls, after that it will be left to Aisha and Daphne, and Tsubaki to take charge.
<p class="calibre1">For  the  faction  valve  alliance,  losing  the  chief  commander  (Lili)  is  not  the  worst situation.
<p class="calibre1">The thing that should be avoided most is not seeing through the enemy's strategy for the sake of self-preservation.
<p class="calibre1">Never  mistake  the  most  priority,  Lily  said  powerfully  to  Chigusa  outside  of  her words.
<p class="calibre1">However,
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, prum! There's no enemy in the center! What should we do after that?"
<p class="calibre1">"Lili's followers, the enemy didn't come from the north in a big circle. We don't have to worry about them coming around to the back yet.
<p class="calibre1">"We're going to cross the border and invade the enemy's territory to the west! Is that okay?
<p class="calibre1">"Commander, what is it? Give me an order!
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p108"></a>(Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah ......! (No matter how brave I am, this is not the amount of information that Lily can handle!)
<p class="calibre1">The mission that must be done is very different from the actual heartfelt words.
<p class="calibre1">Against the broken voice of Bors and Welf and Amazon and elf, looking at these flashing eye crystals, she was tempted to scream and then scatter.
<p class="calibre1">She even resented [Guts] when he had a bad smile on his face and said flatly, "Go ahead  and  do  it.  You'll  be  fine."  and  ordered  her  to  carry  out  this  kind  of multifaceted command.
<p class="calibre1">(But, don't do it can't ......! The weak Lily can only do such things if she wants to help  Lord  Bell  and  the  others!  (Even  Daphne-sama  can't  count  on  her  to  help nowadays!)
<p class="calibre1">Daphne, who reached Lv. 3 after the lower 『Expedition』, is also a valuable upper level battle force in the faction's allied army.
<p class="calibre1">There is no way that she can be asked to assist Lily.
<p class="calibre1">Since  she  decided  to  take  charge  of  the  command,  Lili  lost  the  qualification  of pouting.
<p class="calibre1">With  bloodshot  eyes  and  a  sweaty  forehead,  Lily  gave  instructions  to  all  the adventurers with a look that scared Chigusa. At the same time, she also scribbled the information she heard in her ears onto another piece of parchment that was not a map.
<p class="calibre1">"Once  again,  please  make  the  scout  troops'  discovery  of『enemy  forces』and</p>
<p class="calibre1">『Freya-sama』the  first  target!  Avoid  fighting  as  much  as  possible!  Gathering information is the first priority!"
<p class="calibre1">She shouted subtly in a small voice as she rushed the fist-sized eye crystal in her hand.
<p class="calibre1">This time, in this battle of 『Searching for the gods』, Lily placed great importance on 『Offense』.
<p class="calibre1">The evidence of this is that the ratio of scouts scouting the enemy and the defense team stopping the enemy invasion is seven to three.
<p class="calibre1">To put it in an extreme way, the attack of [Freya's familia] could not be stopped.
<p class="calibre1">The assault of the first level adventurers (Ottar and them) and the tough warriors, even Finn of the largest faction valve in the city (Loki Familia) would say "must be avoided". The adventurers will be shattered if they hold firm, which can be called the footsteps of the end.
<p class="calibre1">Caught in the defense means defeat.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p109"></a>Understanding this, Lilly decided that the best defense was to attack - to create a situation in which the enemy's position would become "passive", and to resolutely refuse to let her camp take the back seat.
<p class="calibre1">(In  any  case,  there  must  be  information!  The  enemy's  approach!  Configuration!
<p class="calibre1">The number of troops! Even if Freya-sama's lurking place is hidden very cleverly, the  position  can  only  be  deduced  by  the  opponent's  formation!  (No  matter  how many traps the enemy has set up in the process!)
<p class="calibre1">Although the mouth did not say, but for the scout troops, Lily's idea is that it does not matter if they are wiped out.
<p class="calibre1">If it could be put differently, it was that she was mentally prepared for the fact that she couldn't avoid sacrifice.
<p class="calibre1">"Touching the enemy" and "destruction" were so equivalent.
<p class="calibre1">Even if both sides were at the same level, there was a huge gap between the basic capabilities of the Faction Alliance and the Familia of the God of Beauty (Freya's Familia).
<p class="calibre1">If they were discovered, the scout force would undoubtedly be wiped out.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eh eh! It means that Lilly-san is treating the scout people as outcasts ......?"
<p class="calibre1">"It just means that no matter what method is used, the result will turn out that way.
<p class="calibre1">Even if I were to take command, it would be the same."
<p class="calibre1">The  heart  of  the  ruins  are  far  from  the  old  market  place.  Daphne,  who  was  in charge of a defense team, had one hand over her ears as if she felt it was noisy, while explaining to Cassandra.
<p class="calibre1">「This 『Search for the Gods』 duel, if we want to win it, we have to divide our manpower to be scouts or scouting troops. After all, it's to find out the opponent's main god in such a vast battlefield."
<p class="calibre1">If  it  was  a  monster  army  (Freya's  familia),  then  there  would  still  be  a  victory condition of "destroying all the families of the faction's allied forces" as long as they were willing to spend time, but let's put that aside for now.
<p class="calibre1">"As long as we have the location of the opponent's main god, we can counterattack no matter how hard the opponent attacks. Because the opponent will have to divide his forces for the attack, he will have to reduce the power to protect the main god."
<p class="calibre1">"Uh ...... [Freya's Familia] must grasp the location of all the gods and goddesses in the allied army and launch an attack, so the battle force must be scattered ......
<p class="calibre1">This is the 'loophole' that Lili-sama wants to target?
<p class="calibre1">"That's it."
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p110"></a>Daphne  glanced  at  the  eye  crystal  hanging  on  her  waist,  and  considering  Lily's current mood, she said, "If you want to reduce the damage to your own side, you have to think about the words.
<p class="calibre1">"If you want to reduce your own damage, you won't be able to win this duel.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"That is to say, this is a way to sacrifice your flesh and break your bones?"
<p class="calibre1">"Yes. That's what Lilly-sama said. To be precise, not only the scout troops like us, but also the gods like Takemikazuchi-sama are 'decoys' ......"
<p class="calibre1">A  scout  unit,  Ouka  and  Mikoto  were  running  through  the  forest,  having  a conversation.
<p class="calibre1">--only to penetrate the heart of the other side while the flesh is cut down.
<p class="calibre1">--no matter how much pain and sorrow accompanies it.
<p class="calibre1">The battle form of the war game had just been decided, and Lili said these words in  front  of  [Hestia's  familia].  Without  the  need  for  Finn  to  mention  it,  that  little commander comprehended the direction of the battle.
<p class="calibre1">Next to Ouka who was thinking, Mikoto said, staring straight ahead.
<p class="calibre1">"Before the last god on your side falls, crush Freya-sama - the method could even be to fight for your life. That's what I'm going to do."
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"That said, the troops' priorities are still very clear.
<p class="calibre1">"You're like Finn in that respect, you're so cunning. No, I should say tactful."
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Amazon Aisha's words, the half-dwarf Tsubaki chuckled lightly.
<p class="calibre1">The number of eye crystals is limited. Aisha and the girls, Daphne and the Mikoto girls, Lily had obviously made a strict selection in order to decide who to give this valuable 『Communicator』 to.
<p class="calibre1">The size of the army was large enough to be called a "coalition army". Whether intentionally or unintentionally, there are bound to be adventurers who do not listen to the instructions of the commander (Lily). The 'Goddess Alliance' that aimed at the head of the Queen (Freya) because of personal grudges was the best example.
<p class="calibre1">Taking all of this into consideration, Lily entrusted the Eye Crystal to trustworthy people - especially Aisha who could become an "Ace" or "Blade".
<p class="calibre1">"We  will  command  the  troops  within  sight  ......  or  monitor  them,  and  then communicate the battle situation to Dot. In short, it's like a centurion, right?
<p class="calibre1">"I am not good at command. I'm not good at commanding, so I'll take care of the headlines, and I'll take care of the trouble, [Lijie]!
<p class="calibre1">"You're the only Lv.5, can't you do some work, [One-Eyed Giant Master] ......"
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p111"></a>Seeing  Tsubaki's  extremely  irresponsible  behavior,  Aisha  said,  "Aren't  you  the head of the [familia]?
<p class="calibre1">After sighing and confirming once again the forgers who were standing by behind her - the 『Artillery Unit』 with a large number of 『Magic Swords』, Aisha said as she rushed to the eye crystal in her hand.
<p class="calibre1">"There is no movement in the center of the battlefield either, little one. ...... It's too quiet, a little scary quiet."
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">(None of the troops could see any visible movement from the enemy ......?) The old market place which is the base camp.
<p class="calibre1">After receiving the report from Aisha and the girls, Lily started a long examination under the watchful eye of Chigusa.
<p class="calibre1">(Is the intention to spy on our approach? ...... But, even if we know this, Lily, we can only investigate!)
<p class="calibre1">With a feeling that she couldn't let go, Lily instructed the scout troops to enter the enemy's territory in turn.
<p class="calibre1">(This side grabbed the eye crystal from Lord Ferros, so the speed of information transmission must be more advantageous to us! [Freya's familia] is different, the further away from the enemy commander (Lord Hedin), the more delay there will be when communicating! (Even for the first level adventurers!) There  must  be  a  gap  that  can  be  inserted  here.  Lilly  believed  so.  Or  rather,  so prayed.
<p class="calibre1">Even with the magic stone transmitter, communication by light, it is impossible to communicate  specific  ideas,  and  some  terrain  is  impossible  to  communicate.  In the form of "Search for the gods", the value of the "eye crystal" that can cross the barrier of time and distance is enough to be called foul.
<p class="calibre1">(In the end, "hide-and-seek" on this island is a battle of information! No matter how many  times  we  lose  a  local  battle,  as  long  as  we  win  on  the  "most  critical"
<p class="calibre1">battlefield!)
<p class="calibre1">Even  if  the  members  of  the  [Freya  Familia]  were  far  away  from  Hedin,  it  didn't matter if they acted according to their own judgment, after all, the only advantage of the faction's allied forces was that there were many of them. While the sacrificed troops are buying time, the others will surround Freya's lurking place together, so that there is still a chance of winning.
<p class="calibre1">(Once  the  enemy's  formation  is  confirmed,  use  the  artillery  unit  with  the  'Krozo Magic  Sword'  and  the  strongest  support  (Haruhime-sama),  and  the  ace  (Bell-</p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p112"></a>sama). Can't keep your hand! Time is Lilly our enemy! (To take away Freya-sama's</p>
<p class="calibre1">『Flower』before losing the forty-six pillars of gods on this side ......!) She  thought  of  the  Haruhime  girls  who  were  now  ordering  her  to  stand  by,  and squeezed and flattened the sweat of her uncomfortable hands.
<p class="calibre1">As Daphne and the girls all perceived, Lily's strategy would cause a huge sacrifice.
<p class="calibre1">But even so, Lily wanted to know the 'correct plate'.
<p class="calibre1">In which zone (grid) what level of soldiers (soldier) were deployed, and where was the goddess (queen) hiding?
<p class="calibre1">What about the chariot (car) that breaks through everything?
<p class="calibre1">What about the white and black elfs (elephants) that will send artillery attacks from afar?
<p class="calibre1">What about the prum (horses) who use their unique actions and combinations to mess up the scene?
<p class="calibre1">And  what  about  the  strongest  fierce  person  (king),  the  guard  of  the  goddess (queen)?
<p class="calibre1">She wanted to get this information as soon as possible, and wanted to overlook the whole game anyway. Even if the scout troops are attacked, as long as they can leave behind information, it is equivalent to gaining a mountain of treasure of a thousand gold. Perhaps it will become the key to sway the battle.
<p class="calibre1">So, Lily put on the cold commander's mask and stifled the guilt.
<p class="calibre1">Just by looking at the level of ruthlessness as a commander, Lily was completely inferior to Finn no matter how she grew up.
<p class="calibre1">"North, no abnormalities."
<p class="calibre1">『South, no enemy invasion.』
<p class="calibre1">"We're moving forward!"
<p class="calibre1">Unlike Lily's inner anxiety, the battlefield was very quiet.
<p class="calibre1">At least on the side of the allied faction, they had to keep quiet.
<p class="calibre1">In order to find Freya as soon as possible, or to catch the movement of the enemy troops coming towards their gods as soon as possible, a large number of scout troops were moving quietly or ambushing at their respective locations.
<p class="calibre1">When will this silence be broken?
<p class="calibre1">Every  minute  and  second  that  passes,  Lily's  chest,  who  commands  the  entire army, will beat more violently.
<p class="calibre1">So Lily waited attentively.
<p class="calibre1">Waiting for the moment when her companions get information.
<p class="calibre1">Waiting  for  the  moment  when  they  and  they  let  out  a  cry  of  grief  and  become sacrificial victims.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p113"></a>She waited and waited and waited and waited patiently, and then-
<p class="calibre1">"........................?"
<p class="calibre1">This 『anomaly』 was found.
<p class="calibre1">It was too quiet.
<p class="calibre1">It was too quiet.
<p class="calibre1">"『Lee, Lilly Luca Ardee ...... has already invaded half of the enemy's territory.
<p class="calibre1">As if confirming Lily's premonition, the elf Luvis reported with a confused voice.
<p class="calibre1">Half of the enemy's domain.
<p class="calibre1">That is, the fact that the allied forces of the faction had netted three quarters of the island.
<p class="calibre1">But still no enemy was encountered, not even the situation of seeing any enemy shadow.
<p class="calibre1">How strange. This is not normal. It's horribly abnormal.
<p class="calibre1">Did the enemy commander (Hedin) really understand the main idea of "searching for the gods"?
<p class="calibre1">"Lili-sama ...... has not found any enemy at all ......"
<p class="calibre1">"Hey Lilly, what's going on? There wasn't even a single battle!
<p class="calibre1">"It's  definitely  not  hidden.  We  also  opened  the  net  with  the  magic  props  of  the Almighty (Asfi). Whether it's transparent or has lost its smell, it definitely can't get through our guard.
<p class="calibre1">Lily's thinking wavered in doubt and uneasiness, and several non-stop flashing eye crystals played a multiplicity of confusion.
<p class="calibre1">The enemy is not there? Don't say stupid things. How is that possible?
<p class="calibre1">But, obviously impossible, the situation broke Lily's prediction.
<p class="calibre1">Aisha's report also eliminated the possibility that they had hidden from their side and were completely hidden.
<p class="calibre1">What was this sense of contradiction? What is this chill?
<p class="calibre1">Have I (Lily) fallen for the enemy's ploy?
<p class="calibre1">Numerous worries flashed through her mind, eroding her heartbeat, and Lily barely suppressed it with a will of steel.
<p class="calibre1">(The west side of the island ...... intends to lead Lily us into enemy territory? But what can this do? The purpose is to make our formation stretched into a long snake of playing horizontal, away from the lurking Hestia-sama them? (Or is it that the other  side  has  prepared  a  trap  to  wipe  out  the  allied  forces  of  the  faction warlords ......?)
<p class="calibre1">Lily's  trembling  hand  wrote  down  the  common  language  on  the  parchment, updated the information, and tried to read the plate.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p114"></a>Considering  the  possibilities  over  and  over  in  her  mind,  sifting  through  all  the elements she could think of, the burn produced a confused spirit.
<p class="calibre1">Was it okay to continue west? Shouldn't the troops be brought to a temporary halt?
<p class="calibre1">But what could be done by bringing the situation to a standstill?
<p class="calibre1">If we don't get information, neither pre-emptive attack nor response is possible.
<p class="calibre1">The incomprehensible situation caused Lily's thoughts to stall, and she gradually became immobilized - just then.
<p class="calibre1">"We've found them! The enemy has been spotted!
<p class="calibre1">"!
<p class="calibre1">Among the rows of eye crystals, one glowed.
<p class="calibre1">The owner of the voice was Luvis. The [Modi Familia], who was at the front of the scouting force, was in a group of four.
<p class="calibre1">Lily's shoulders shuddered  violently,  and  then had  as much  as a flying  lunge to pick up the crystal communicator.
<p class="calibre1">"Where is it?
<p class="calibre1">"West, west! The westernmost side of the island!
<p class="calibre1">--The westernmost side!
<p class="calibre1">The  unbelievable  report  "Corner  of  the  battlefield"  made  Lily  wonder  if  she  had heard it wrong.
<p class="calibre1">"Where are the numbers? What about the scale!?"
<p class="calibre1">Although she resisted the urge to ask the other side what was going on, she almost shouted  out,  completely  forgetting  that  Luvis  and  the  others  were  still  keeping hidden to avoid being discovered by the enemy.
<p class="calibre1">However, there was no response even after a long time.
<p class="calibre1">Only the sound of a backward breath came through the crystal.
<p class="calibre1">Just as Lily's expression was tinged with confusion, Luvis opened his mouth.
<p class="calibre1">"...... All troops."
<p class="calibre1">"...... huh?"
<p class="calibre1">The elf's voice trembled as he said to the time still villainous people.
<p class="calibre1">『【Freya Familia】, the whole army.』
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"What is this ......?"
<p class="calibre1">Molde was flabbergasted by the sight before him.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p115"></a>"Hey, hey ......"
<p class="calibre1">"What's this ......?
<p class="calibre1">The voices of Welf, who was carrying the 『Magic Sword』, and Dormul, who was carrying the shield, were overlapping.
<p class="calibre1">"Are ...... serious, these guys ......"
<p class="calibre1">Bors's right eye that wasn't covered by an eye patch stared extremely wide, and cold sweat oozed out of his body.
<p class="calibre1">"Place the entire army on the westernmost side of the island! Are you kidding?"
<p class="calibre1">The  deputy  commander  (Daphne),  who  must  have  predicted  dozens  of  enemy approaches, said with a vent.
<p class="calibre1">The westernmost side of the city ruins, with the dangerous cliffs and the lake of the depression at their backs.
<p class="calibre1">This was where the "base camp" of [Freya's Familia] was set up.
<p class="calibre1">One hundred and fifty soldiers were deployed in the area where countless shrine sites were lined up. The uniform of the valve "Glorious Familia Uniform" wore their respective armament and formed a circle like an iron fence.
<p class="calibre1">They did not look like they were going to move, could not see the signs of chanting incantations, did not even move a little.
<p class="calibre1">The enemy army had built a "Goddess Castle" that could be said to be defended by ten thousand troops on the western most side of this urban ruin.
<p class="calibre1">"Where is Freya-sama? Is she really in the enemy's position?
<p class="calibre1">In the old market place to the east, the expression on Lily's face, who was shouting at the crystal, was changing at a dizzying pace.
<p class="calibre1">Shaken and shocked, confused and anxious, and the fear of "I don't think so".
<p class="calibre1">She prayed for the possibility that it was a trap or an empty throne, and confirmed it over and over again.
<p class="calibre1">"Wait, wait! ............ is not right, it's there! The goddess Freya is also in the position!
<p class="calibre1">Back to the lake, the deepest shrine, she is inside!"
<p class="calibre1">Southwest of the ruins, Luvis, who had ascended to the old site of the tallest tower in the island, could not remain calm either and shouted in response.
<p class="calibre1">The elf archer's one eye narrowed, and in front of his sight, the goddess stayed in the large shrine where most of the ceiling was lifted, the 『House of Gods』.
<p class="calibre1">She  sat  on  the  throne  prepared  by  her  subordinates  without  any  particular movement, leaning on her cheek with her hand.
<p class="calibre1">Suddenly, she raised her head and her silver pupils looked back without a doubt, causing the elf (Luvis) to turn blue again.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p116"></a>"Where are the Rangers! Isn't it a plan to use the huge fortress as bait for the first level adventurers (monsters) to make a surprise attack around the back!
<p class="calibre1">"...... No, everyone is there. At least, the main force was in that position. [Goddess Chariot]  and  [Inferno  Gold  Four  Warriors],  [Black  Demon  Demon  Sword]  and
<p class="calibre1">[White Demon Demon Staff], ...... and Ottarh too."
<p class="calibre1">The western part of the metropolitan ruins, at the huge tomb in the center.
<p class="calibre1">The expression on the face of Tsubaki, who was carefully observing the situation of [Freya's familia], was also bitter like swallowing a worm.
<p class="calibre1">"No wonder we couldn't catch the enemy's shadow ......"
<p class="calibre1">From the beginning of the battle, the other side had not left that 'base camp' even for a single step.
<p class="calibre1">In  addition  to  Tsubaki  and  Aisha,  the  adventurers  who  received  instructions through the scout team invaded the western side of the domain one after another, and then invariably were dumbfounded.
<p class="calibre1">"Cave, Cave Bear ......?"
<p class="calibre1">Mikoto murmured in a dumbfounded manner.
<p class="calibre1">Upon  seeing  the  enemy's  formation,  she  remembered  a  tactic  that  would  be adopted in the board game of the Far East.
<p class="calibre1">The  'fortress'  formation  that  surrounded  the  king  and  relied  on  soldiers  and generals to hold until the end.
<p class="calibre1">"No, this is the real deal, the 'backwater formation' ......!
<p class="calibre1">Takemikazuchi said with a groan.
<p class="calibre1">After seeing the sight shown by the eye crystal held by the goddess on the east side of the island far away from the Mikoto girls, he sensed everything.
<p class="calibre1">The enemy had cut off their retreat, and instead of using any petty tricks, they were preparing to meet the faction valve alliance head-on.
<p class="calibre1">"Eh? Eh! What's going on here!?"
<p class="calibre1">"Ignoring the rules of the game ......!
<p class="calibre1">Inside the labyrinth city.
<p class="calibre1">Beside Tiona, who couldn't keep up with the situation, Ace took a breath.
<p class="calibre1">"I really did choose that side.
<p class="calibre1">Inside the living room of the same base, Finn's blue eyes narrowed sharply.
<p class="calibre1">"Hermes-sama, this is ......!"
<p class="calibre1">"They didn't violate the rules of the competition. They just abandoned the 'common sense' that should have been followed.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p117"></a>The  whole  city  suddenly  fell  into  chaos  and  Asfi  in  the  "Tower  of  Babel"  was shaken, but Hermes said to her indifferently as if he could see through her "tactics"
<p class="calibre1">as well.
<p class="calibre1">"This is a battle that only [Freya's Familia] can do ......!
<p class="calibre1">Once again to the island.
<p class="calibre1">Hestia's right hand clenched her eye crystal, her face was very stiff.
<p class="calibre1">"......! Master ......!"
<p class="calibre1">In the end, Bell, who was hiding from both the enemy and our army and was acting alone with certainty, had the figure of the person who was probably planning all this in her mind.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who is going to abide by the rules of this boring game?
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">While the battlefield and the maze city in front of the mountains were wrapped up in the impact.
<p class="calibre1">In a corner of the [Freya's Familia] formation, Hedin said arrogantly.
<p class="calibre1">He stood above the shrine that had a clear view of our soldiers and pushed down his glasses with his right hand.
<p class="calibre1">"Within the range that my voice can reach, the warriors will move as if they had a command. This is the most efficient method. This is the strongest formation."
<p class="calibre1">Wind combed his beautiful long blonde hair while he asserted so.
<p class="calibre1">The  strong  warriors  who  were  silent  up  to  the  second  level  did  not  need  to  be mentioned, and even the first level adventurers showed different expressions of dissatisfaction or smacking their lips, but all of them silently affirmed.
<p class="calibre1">"Respond to me quickly. There are only two choices for you."
<p class="calibre1">Hedin's combat was extremely simple.
<p class="calibre1">To concentrate the battle power in one place - that is, to give up the 'search for the gods'.
<p class="calibre1">This is exactly the same as what the goddess (Hestia) learned, and it is because of the [Freya Familia] that this tactic can be adopted.
<p class="calibre1">If  the  allied  forces  of  the  warlords  also  adopted  this  tactic,  they  would  only  be crushed and collapsed, which is the privilege of the overwhelmingly strong.
<p class="calibre1">It  was  because  they  were  able  to  do  the  so-called  "Yokozuna  Sumo"  of  the Mushajin (Takemikazuchi) that they committed the atrocity of turning the "search for the gods" into a "mere duel".
<p class="calibre1">And  this  atrocity  was  the  true  nature  of  the  enemy's  formation  that  the  faction alliance had been trying to find out.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p118"></a>
<p class="calibre1">(O demon...)
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily's face turned blue.
<p class="calibre1">She left the old market site on the east side with her escort Chigusa and rushed to the huge grave where Aisha and the girls were waiting, and the moment she saw the formation, it was as if her internal organs were frozen.
<p class="calibre1">It was too naive.
<p class="calibre1">Heard  so  much  information  from  Finn's  side,  but  still  did  not  build  up  enough awareness.
<p class="calibre1">Did  not  recognize  how  annoyingly  inefficient  the  enemy  commander  (Hedin Selander) was, and what a cruel elf he was.
<p class="calibre1">She painfully realized how big a gap there was between the two 'positions' in terms of commanders.
<p class="calibre1">(He was not going to talk to Lily at all, not going to play with pieces! He ignored the sequence of moves and rules, and instead was saying to me, "Draw your sword!") It was like sticking a sword on the board in front of a dumb chess player (Lily) and saying, "Draw and cut me.
<p class="calibre1">Generally speaking, the first thing you want to do is to look for the gods.
<p class="calibre1">Where to scout.
<p class="calibre1">Where to hide the gods.
<p class="calibre1">Where to place an ambush.
<p class="calibre1">Considering these huge numbers of options, we were able to formulate tactics.
<p class="calibre1">But  Hedin  turned  the  tedious  battle  form  of  "searching  for  gods"  itself  into  a
<p class="calibre1">"battlefield (field) to his advantage".
<p class="calibre1">Since  the  enemy  army  was  not  scattered  in  battle  but  gathered  together,  Lily's planned battle of 『shedding her own flesh and breaking her bones』 had lost its meaning. Something like "searching for each other's gods" would not happen.
<p class="calibre1">From the time the fortress was built, there were only two options left for the coalition of faction leaders.
<p class="calibre1">That is, whether to attack by suicide or not.
<p class="calibre1">(That elf ...... is a demon ......!!!)
<p class="calibre1">Lily said the same words in her mind indignantly countless times and listened to the sound of thinking idle.
<p class="calibre1">The worst『Either one』.
<p class="calibre1">Other than that, there was no other option. At least the current Lily couldn't think of any other way.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p119"></a>She knew very well that she had to make this second choice in favor of the enemy and was forced to make a decision.
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, what's wrong, Commander!
<p class="calibre1">The voice that rang out from the eye crystal, urging her on was the anxious voices of Mord and Bors and the others.
<p class="calibre1">The option of a long-term battle, no.
<p class="calibre1">Freya's Familia] had concentrated their entire force in one place. In the end, the opponent's  base  ability  was  very  different,  and  launching  attacks  sporadically would  also  be  met,  only  increasing  losses  for  nothing.  If  the  two  armies  keep confronting  each  other  and  are  attacked  by  surprise  after  their  concentration  is exhausted, they will also suffer heavy losses.
<p class="calibre1">One of the major prerequisites for Lili and the girls, who were not as strong as the other side, was that they could not turn to a 'defensive position'. Even if we want to  compare  the  so-called  army  rations,  since  the  number  of  adventurers  of  the faction alliance army was overwhelmingly high, it was obvious that it must be the faction alliance army that ran out of food first.
<p class="calibre1">There is no point in choosing a long-term war. It doesn't make any sense!
<p class="calibre1">There was only one way left, and that was to comply with the enemy's request and fight a "duel" here!
<p class="calibre1">"Lilly, Lilly-sama ......"
<p class="calibre1">"Lilly-sama ......"
<p class="calibre1">Her escort Chigusa, and Haruhime who arrived at the huge tomb a little late, found Lily's side face covered with sweat and were a little panicked.
<p class="calibre1">Not good, can not shake, will affect the command, she thought so, but sweat still can not stop dripping down, heartbeat is not calmed. Aisha, Tsubaki and Daphne, who had been waiting for the commander to arrive, also watched the development without  saying  a  word,  while  Lily  stood  in  the  maze  of  entanglement  without  an exit.
<p class="calibre1">Could it be that there was only the desperate challenge of a "head-on duel" with
<p class="calibre1">[Freya's familia]?
<p class="calibre1">Such a decision was out of character for a commander. Is there no other way? If Finn was here, what would he say?
<p class="calibre1">Is it true that we can only send our companions to that place of death?
<p class="calibre1">The responsibility and weight of a commander was about to overwhelm Lily, and at that moment.
<p class="calibre1">"Lily."
<p class="calibre1">The white eye crystal hanging on her waist glowed.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p120"></a>"Let's go."
<p class="calibre1">His voice was trembling, and the boy himself was fighting against his fear, but he said so anyway.
<p class="calibre1">Let's face it together. He said so, his hand went around  Lily's back and pushed her, who was immobilized by fear.
<p class="calibre1">In this way alone, a light shone in, opening a path in the maze of no exit.
<p class="calibre1">The thoughts that were so confusing just now became clear, and the sound of a manic heartbeat gathered towards the other side of determination.
<p class="calibre1">The young girl's hand clenched into a fist.
<p class="calibre1">"--Please center the scattered battle force.
<p class="calibre1">With sweat still dripping from her face, Lily stared at the enemy line with a gleaming gaze and said.
<p class="calibre1">"Re-form your troops as soon as possible. All the scouts of Lord Luvis are to be included in the guerrilla force."
<p class="calibre1">"I know, I know!"
<p class="calibre1">"Haruhime-sama, please put on the transparent cloth (reversal of the spiritual veil) and stay in the grave. Do not let the enemy or the city find you. Stay close to Aisha-sama and the others, and be ready to use your level up at any time.
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, yes!"
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Daphne began to give instructions to Cassandra and the girls, and Haruhime and the battle whores who were guarding her dived into the huge tomb for the time being.
<p class="calibre1">"Chigusa-sama, you no longer need to serve as Lily's escort. Please rendezvous with Ouka-sama and the others and help them a little."
<p class="calibre1">"Lilly-sama ...... is good!"
<p class="calibre1">"Aisha-sama, Tsubaki-sama, do you know where the enemy's healer is?"
<p class="calibre1">"...... No, I can't see it from here.
<p class="calibre1">"Those guys are hiding too, right? Only this one will be known only when the battle begins.
<p class="calibre1">"Then, after the battle starts,  please make sure they look for  the location of the Cinderellas with full Bellies. Lily's side will also try to find as much as possible, but must make breaking the enemy's lifeline the highest priority goal. ...... magic props should also be distributed to Luvis-sama and the others please.''
<p class="calibre1">Chigusa nodded vigorously, Aisha and Tsubaki also agreed down with smiles on their lips.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p121"></a>Thanks  to  the  smooth  voice  of  command,  as  well  as  the  villain's  stance  that breathes awe and courage, the faction-valve allied forces got rid of the faltering time.
<p class="calibre1">Mord  and  the  others,  who  witnessed  all  this  through  the  eye  crystal,  and  the adventurers around them, who heard the instructions given one after another, all replied back with great vigor 『Oh-oh! "Leave it to me! I'll take care of it.
<p class="calibre1">"The  troops  other  than  the  guerrillas  would  be  divided  into  three  branches.
<p class="calibre1">Tsubaki-sama will be in the center, Aisha-sama will be on the left, and Daphne-sama and Bors-sama will be on the right. Now please equip the 『Magic Sword』
<p class="calibre1">and make sure to cover all the troops!
<p class="calibre1">The chaotic morale quickly regrouped while Lily gave orders one by one.
<p class="calibre1">It  can  be  said  that  the  advantage  of  the  speed  of  communication  of  command, which  Lily  wanted  to  win  by  relying  on  the  eye  crystal  to  live,  has  largely disappeared.
<p class="calibre1">As long as Hedin can see and hear the range, his command voice can be conveyed to all soldiers. Even if there is some delay in it, it is just an error. The 10,000 troops completely under his command must be able to make up for the speed of the eye crystal's intelligence.
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, the obvious advantage that remained on this side was the large number of 『Crozzo's Magic Sword』.
<p class="calibre1">We can only rely on the firepower of the powerful magic swords prepared by the
<p class="calibre1">[Hephaestus Familia] and built by Welf night and day to dismantle the 'strongest formation'.
<p class="calibre1">(No trembling, no cowardice! For Lord Bell, Lily is standing here now!) Let me break it.
<p class="calibre1">No, it must be broken.
<p class="calibre1">Think of the sorrow and anger!
<p class="calibre1">Freya and her Familia "charmed" us and hurt Bell, so even if it's to clear this shame, we have to destroy that enemy formation from now on!
<p class="calibre1">(Lily is the commander of this faction-valve allied army (team)!!!) Forced to inspire herself, Lily drew the sword stuck on the board and aimed the blade at the demonic elf.
<p class="calibre1">"Come on then ......!"
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not bad for a pass."
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  the  reorganization  of  the  combined  forces  of  the  faction  valves  from  his own camp, Hedin said this about Lily's 'courageous determination'.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p122"></a>Hedin  had  planned  that  if  he  was  scared  to  death  because  his  opponent  was
<p class="calibre1">[Freya's  familia],  or  if  he  tried  to  play  some  useless  ploy,  he  would  instantly disintegrate half of the faction's allied forces.
<p class="calibre1">"I spit on incompetence. However, the weak who struggle to become capable are to be commended.
<p class="calibre1">An ordinary commander would be so cowed by the power gap between the two sides that he would not even bother to draw his sword from the board.
<p class="calibre1">In this regard, the little human girl who was said to have been instructed by Finn got a passing score as did the teenager (Bell).
<p class="calibre1">"If you do, it seems that you can cut each other with me as planned.
<p class="calibre1">Hedin, who had secretly approved of a young girl, gave instructions.
<p class="calibre1">"Tell them to prepare a surprise attack. Don't defend, just attack."
<p class="calibre1">"As ordered!"
<p class="calibre1">A member of the regiment ran out, while the white elf stared at the movement of the allied faction of warlords.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"It  feels  like  a  dream.  I  can't  believe  I'm  going  head  to  head  with  [Freya's familia] ......"
<p class="calibre1">"I know ...... is having a nightmare, right?
<p class="calibre1">Receiving instructions from the base camp (Lilly), a large number of adventurers walked around side by side.
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the whisper of Guile of the other faction valve(Ogma familia) whose blood is all gone, the corner of Naza's mouth curled up slightly.
<p class="calibre1">"I thought that this time the opponent is not a monster then I can also fight before joining in, but ...... this is really scary. It's horrible."
<p class="calibre1">Own right arm, wrapped by the glove『Silver arm』is trembling.
<p class="calibre1">Compared  to  the  enemy,  the  floor  master  is  much  better,  the  other  side  is  the strongest enemy that will make people think so, and it is the 『strongest enemy』
<p class="calibre1">among the enemies that can be thought of. Even if Naza, who always had a calm face, could not be unrelated to terror at this time.
<p class="calibre1">"...... But, I can't run away. I can't hurt Bell anymore, I have to help him to do so."
<p class="calibre1">Even so, she will not use the word regret.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p123"></a>Because Naza is also the same as Lilly and the girls, she decides to fight for Bell's sake adventurers.
<p class="calibre1">Guile, who looked at her smile fascinatedly, also said "...... us too. The two of them are determined to return to the smile.
<p class="calibre1">Then, the two did not say goodbye, just towards their own location.
<p class="calibre1">The ax resistant Guile went to the guerrilla group, and Naza with a bow and arrow was the left flank.
<p class="calibre1">"The  adventurers  in  the  front  guard  shield  position  gathered  in  the  central  unit, emphasizing  defense,  while  the  two  wings  were  made  up  of  orcs  and  elfs, emphasizing  mechanics.  All  Dwarves  of  the  [Magni  Familia]  should  go  to  the center.
<p class="calibre1">On the huge tomb where all the members have left except herself, Lily kept rushing to the eye crystal at her hand to give orders.
<p class="calibre1">You can't assign adventurers by ability. The group members of the same faction valve will act together to have a better understanding. In addition to Naza, whom she knows very well, the other troops are configured as faction valves.
<p class="calibre1">In  the  central  unit  are  Tsubaki,  Welf,  Dormul  and  their  [Magni  Families],  and numerous [Hephaestus Families] superior forgers.
<p class="calibre1">On the right flank are Daphne, the healers Cassandra, Ouka and Chigusa, and the lawless ones of Maze Inn Street (Riviera) led by Bors.
<p class="calibre1">On  the  left  flank  were  Aisha  and  the  Amazons  of  the  former  [Ishtar  Familia].
<p class="calibre1">Compared to the other two units, the number of 『Magic Swords』 was smaller, so Lily had allocated her life here as well, trying to make up for it with the power and scale of 『Gravity Magic』.
<p class="calibre1">Following  the  three  units  were  the  magic  guides  and  the  reserve  unit  hiding Haruhime.
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the guerrillas used the obstacle and quietly slid towards the position of the
<p class="calibre1">『ambushers』.
<p class="calibre1">"I think we should change our configuration as well.
<p class="calibre1">"Don't think about it. The gods (us) won't be able to do that. After that, just hide here and watch.
<p class="calibre1">Inside some ruins, Hestia anxiously peered at the eye crystal attached to Lili, while Hephaestus, who was moving with her, leaned against the wall with his hands on his chest and closed his eyes.
<p class="calibre1">The east side of the island where the allied gods lurked, except for the adventurers who served as escorts, no other dependents could be seen.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p124"></a>The  battlefield  is  located  further  west  than  the  central  dividing  line  that  extends north to south of the island.
<p class="calibre1">The faction warlords who had built their base camp on the huge tomb in the center of the west side were confronting the [Freya Familia] who had spread their forces and vowed to protect the "House of God" in the far west.
<p class="calibre1">"...... is the first time I've seen such a quiet war game.
<p class="calibre1">In the distant city, the loudspeaker made of magic stone caught the small murmur of Iblee, who usually makes a lot of noise.
<p class="calibre1">As he said, the scene was very quiet.
<p class="calibre1">There  was  only  the  movement  of  the  reorganization  of  the  forces  of  the  allied faction.
<p class="calibre1">Other than that, there was neither the sound of swords and halberds clashing nor the roar of anger ringing out.
<p class="calibre1">The gods of the island, as well as the inhabitants of the city, held their breath and watched in silence, and this continued for a long time.
<p class="calibre1">But, finally.
<p class="calibre1">The moment came when the silence was broken.
<p class="calibre1">"...... is about to begin. Please move forward to ......"
<p class="calibre1">After the allied forces of the faction valves finished preparing, Lily gave the order to the crystal held in one hand.
<p class="calibre1">What unfolded in front of the view of both camps was the great battlefield where the crumbling remains of the structure eventually turned into an ocean of stone.
<p class="calibre1">Once thought to be a building of chaos and disorderly zoning, now turned into a historic open space with an unobstructed view.
<p class="calibre1">The horizontal group, divided into three large units, was so tense that they forgot to breathe and started marching toward the [Freya's Familia] in the depths of their vision.
<p class="calibre1">"Don't move."
<p class="calibre1">The response of [Freya's Familia] was, "Don't move.
<p class="calibre1">They  obeyed  Hedin's  calm  and  thorough  words,  maintained  their  respective configurations, and did not move.
<p class="calibre1">Some  of  them  were  like  door  guards  with  their  gun  hilts  firmly  inserted  into  the ground, while others had their swords in their sheaths and stared ahead.
<p class="calibre1">"Don't stop, advance ......"
<p class="calibre1">The many eyes looking out this way made the cross team want to stop, when Lilly gave the order again.
<p class="calibre1">What she wanted was an effective range.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p125"></a>The "Magic Sword" was capable of spewing flames that would burn out the enemy camp's artillery range.
<p class="calibre1">With the illusion that every step the troops took would cut off a little bit of their lives, she ordered the march with a spirit of steel.
<p class="calibre1">"Advance ......"
<p class="calibre1">The allied forces of the Paiju advanced.
<p class="calibre1">"Don't move."
<p class="calibre1">The tough warriors did not move.
<p class="calibre1">"Advance ......"
<p class="calibre1">Sweat dripped down the side of the little human girl's face.
<p class="calibre1">"Don't move."
<p class="calibre1">The elf warlord's face was unchanged.
<p class="calibre1">"Go to ......"
<p class="calibre1">Droplets of liquid fell from the girl's jaw.
<p class="calibre1">"Don't move."
<p class="calibre1">The warlord's eyes will never misread 『interval distance』.
<p class="calibre1">"Forward--"
<p class="calibre1">The next instant.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kill."
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
<p class="calibre1">The roar of war hit the sky.
<p class="calibre1">"Here we go!
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the strong warriors that changed from a non-moving situation to a horrible wave, Boros shouted.
<p class="calibre1">"「『Magic Sword』, prepare--!
<p class="calibre1">Tsubaki's roar rang out from the center, causing the adventurers who were close to cowering to raise their magic swords in unison.
<p class="calibre1">"It's not ready yet! Don't fire it yet!"
<p class="calibre1">Aisha on the left flank observed the timing of the barrage.
<p class="calibre1">"The enemy is not shooting "magic"! Because of the lack of range, everyone stays calm!"
<p class="calibre1">Daphne on the right flank signaled the result of her analysis.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p126"></a>In the era of the gods, when the battle started, "magic" would often come instead of arrows. But nowadays, there was none. That means the enemy was too alert for 『Crozzo's magic sword』 and finally did not hold back.
<p class="calibre1">That was how it seemed to Daphne and the girls.
<p class="calibre1">"Ummmm ......!?"
<p class="calibre1">However, the threat that kept approaching was the real deal.
<p class="calibre1">The murderous weapon, the beastly shout, not to mention the acceleration from the vicious ability.
<p class="calibre1">The scattered assaults without any consideration for combinations are just like the Fury  Wave.  The  Familiasmen  of  [Freya's  Familia],  who  were  exhausting  their individual strength in the "Battle Wilderness" every day, did not think about their companions. They just wanted to run through the enemy with their own weapons and fought to defeat the faction alliance.
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the surprise attack that seemed like a crooked mountain of swords, Ouka and Chigusa, who were holding the 『Magic Sword』 in their hands, couldn't help but feel a little discouraged.
<p class="calibre1">"Not yet, not yet! It's not time yet! Don't be in a hurry!"
<p class="calibre1">Bors'  own  voice  trembled  at  the  frightening  sight,  and  he  tried  desperately  to suppress this emotion.
<p class="calibre1">Approaching. Coming. Swarming.
<p class="calibre1">As long as there was no more distance, his side would be ravaged in an instant.
<p class="calibre1">Facing the strongest warriors, he felt the pressure that made his tongue dry, but he still survived the moment that seemed like infinity.
<p class="calibre1">"Not yet, not yet ---- is now!
<p class="calibre1">Then.
<p class="calibre1">The next thing you need to know is that  Bors is spitting  and  sputtering,  and  his veins are bursting.
<p class="calibre1">"Fire --------- -----!!!"
<p class="calibre1">Tsubaki's firing signal also overlapped with it.
<p class="calibre1">With that.
<p class="calibre1">"Huang Yue --------- -------!!!"
<p class="calibre1">Countless 『Magic Swords』 spewed out flames.
<p class="calibre1">Explosive heat, blizzard, thunder, and gale, all exploded in the advancing army.
<p class="calibre1">"--------- --------!
<p class="calibre1">The seven-colored cannon flashes of different systems intertwined with each other, turning  into  a  violent  stream  of  magical  power  that  wiped  out  the  cries  of  the
<p class="calibre1">[Freya's Familia] that was hit directly.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p127"></a>Boom and impact. The stone slabs laid on the ground cracked and the entire urban ruins shook.
<p class="calibre1">The bombardment came in one wave after another. The flurry of fire from the large force triggered a chain reaction that instantly gave birth to a flood of destruction.
<p class="calibre1">"Kiriye!
<p class="calibre1">"Goo-eeh!"
<p class="calibre1">"Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
<p class="calibre1">The unceasing cannon fire swept away the orcs running ahead, then the humans, and then obliterated the half-elves in a burst of flame.
<p class="calibre1">In front of the conflicting, overwhelming unreasonableness of the 『speed cannon of artillery attack』, even [Freya's familia] couldn't dodge it. The Herculean second rank adventurers became the bait food of the magic sword and were swallowed into the glittering vortex.
<p class="calibre1">All  of  the『Crozzo's  magic  swords』were  far  more  powerful  than  the  long  text chanting magic of the upper level magic guides.
<p class="calibre1">Coupled with the 『Magic Sword』 created by the [Hephaestus Familia], the fire power had swelled to the point of excess. The sheer heat of this might even be able to suppress the deep layers of the dungeon.
<p class="calibre1">The sight of widespread annihilation even made the adventurers using 『Crozzo's Magic Sword』 tremble.
<p class="calibre1">However, this shock was immediately replaced by "fear".
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Unbeatable.
<p class="calibre1">Whether your skin burns or you lose your weapon.
<p class="calibre1">Whether it's one hand or one foot blown away.
<p class="calibre1">The familia members of the gods of beauty will not stop.
<p class="calibre1">"Welp!?"
<p class="calibre1">Cassandra, forgetting that she was even a healer, clutched her long staff and let out a wailing cry.
<p class="calibre1">The humanoids that had been mercilessly scorched were still assaulting this way.
<p class="calibre1">Dwarves with icicles sprouting from their bodies, Amazons clutching their arms cut off by wind blades, no matter how many times they were blown away, they would get up in turn, some even stepping on the bodies of their companions and bursting towards the faction warlord alliance.
<p class="calibre1">"「『Tough Warrior』!
<p class="calibre1">Daphne couldn't hold back anymore and shouted out.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p128"></a>The  army  that  was  still  attacking  in  this  hellish  scene  could  be  considered  as  a berserker warrior.
<p class="calibre1">The Freya Familia] did not fear death. They and they repeated the process of dying in the battle wilderness night and day, and were truly coming back from the dead.
<p class="calibre1">This is accompanied by terror. There is also pain. But the tenacious Goddesses force it down with their spotless loyalty and undisguised instinct to fight.
<p class="calibre1">So they would not stop.
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of the fierce fire of the 『Demon Sword』, they are still running with all their might and trying to fight.
<p class="calibre1">Thus, they are warriors who do not fear death (Enhalia).
<p class="calibre1">Seeing this trick that only [Freya's familia] could do - one of the reasons why they were  called the 'strongest faction valve',  the adventurers all lost their  blood and were too scared to move.
<p class="calibre1">"Fear, fear nothing! Crush them! Shoot me! Shoot! One after another, shoot!
<p class="calibre1">Fear made Bors roar out, but it had an effect.
<p class="calibre1">Because it was a reckless and simple order, the adventurers were able to obey him as a reflex.
<p class="calibre1">Shoot. Shoot. Fire.
<p class="calibre1">They  just  swung  it  down  and  raised  it  up  again,  praying  for  the  death  defying warrior to go for broke, desperately releasing wave after wave of fire.
<p class="calibre1">If the sword cracks and shatters, the adventurers who are waiting in the back row come forward and make a new magic sword roar.
<p class="calibre1">Without  passing  through  the  "Mirror  of  God",  the  sound  of  the  cannon  like  a volcanic eruption went directly over the treacherous mountains to Orario, causing the shoulders of many people to tremble.
<p class="calibre1">"Wow! ...... is scary."
<p class="calibre1">"It's really war."
<p class="calibre1">"But, only this way Hestia and the girls can win."
<p class="calibre1">"No  wonder  that  fool  of  a  war  god  (Ares)  is  so  obsessed  with  the  magic  sword forger (Krozo) ......"
<p class="calibre1">In addition to the shivering people, the gods in the 『Tower of Babel』 also said their thoughts.
<p class="calibre1">The  successive  booming  of  the  cannons  spread  the  tremors  throughout  the
<p class="calibre1">『Mountains of Béor』.
<p class="calibre1">The ground on the mountain shook, and even the monsters inhabiting it felt fear and moved away from the huge depression lake.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p129"></a>Then, when the number of gradually crushed『Crozzo's magic sword』was about to pass half.
<p class="calibre1">When  the  huge  amount  of  smoke,  sparks,  cold  air,  breeze  with  electricity  and particles of light of different colors all quietly dissipated - even the stone slabs were completely destroyed on the battlefield, countless strong warriors fell down.
<p class="calibre1">"............ Hahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahahaha! It's done! You deserve it, you [Freya Familiasmen]!!!"
<p class="calibre1">It  took  several  dozen  seconds  to  confirm  that  the  enemy  would  not  get  up,  and Bors kept laughing excitedly.
<p class="calibre1">"What a tough warrior! We have the Magic Sword of Krozo in our hands!
<p class="calibre1">His  laughter  spread  around,  and  the  other  adventurers,  who  were  breathing heavily, began to cheer one after another.
<p class="calibre1">Tough warriors are not afraid of death, but they are not immune to it. They are not beyond existence.
<p class="calibre1">Therefore the limit would come. This time it was the firepower of "Crozzo's Magic Sword" that exceeded the tenacity of the warriors, that's all.
<p class="calibre1">--Ohhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh! The allied forces of the warlords boiled over.
<p class="calibre1">Although  there  were  no  enemy  first  rank  adventurers  among  them,  they  still chipped away at most of their battle power. With the immediate results of the battle, the outpost could be considered a complete victory. The members of the various faction valve groups raised the hilts of their shattered swords and shouted loudly.
<p class="calibre1">Only some of them frowned.
<p class="calibre1">Although this was the only method, it was not even called a tactic, and the act of relying on fire power to force a breakthrough still caused mixed feelings, as was the case with Daphne and Aisha girls.
<p class="calibre1">"Kingdom (Rakia)'s 『Myth of Invincibility』 ...... Damn it!
<p class="calibre1">Among them, Welf who had mass-produced『Crozzo's magic sword』was tainted with bitterness between his eyebrows.
<p class="calibre1">Welf's  hometown『Rakia  Kingdom』was  once  at  war  with  many  countries  by virtue  of  countless『Crozzo's  Magic  Sword』and  turned  various  terrains  into scorched earth. The destruction caused by it led to many elves holding a grudge, and  even  cursed  by  the  elves.  The  scene  in  front  of  me  was  just  like  what  the kingdom  (Rakia),  which  had  established  the  "myth  of  invincibility",  had  done.  At least that's what it looks like to Welf.
<p class="calibre1">"In the end, I've done the same thing as that country ......!
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p130"></a>The fact that he was on the same path as the kingdom that he had so despised caused a violent wave of self-loathing to rise up in his heart.
<p class="calibre1">However,
<p class="calibre1">There was a misunderstanding in Welf's disgust.
<p class="calibre1">There was a difference in Welf's interpretation.
<p class="calibre1">Welf's perception, too naive.
<p class="calibre1">"Hahahahahahahahahahahahahaha - ...... ha?"
<p class="calibre1">Bors's loud laughter that resounded all around stopped.
<p class="calibre1">What was reflected in his right eye was the stone slab that had been lifted after shattering, and the [Freya's familia] that had fallen to the ground.
<p class="calibre1">And, the countless particles of gold light that looked like the color of dusk.
<p class="calibre1">"My name is gold. I swear not to rot, the arm of the goddess]"
<p class="calibre1">The next thing that came to the ears of the adventurers was a clear, clear song.
<p class="calibre1">"[Suffered three times the baking, forever suffering piercing torment. If the gun is a prison, then the light will come out and destroy death and injury]"
<p class="calibre1">The voice came from the enemy's formation.
<p class="calibre1">Looking at the distant front from the allied forces of the faction, in the depths of the sand and dust that was becoming clear, "They" appeared.
<p class="calibre1">"Cinderellas with full Bellies?
<p class="calibre1">Lili was the first to notice them.
<p class="calibre1">Those maroon pupils caught a group of people like witches, uniformly clad in white cloaks.
<p class="calibre1">The fierce shelling from the "Magic Sword" raised enough sand (curtain) to cover the battlefield, and the commander who failed to detect the other side in time let out a sad cry.
<p class="calibre1">"[Wish  (madness),  wish  (madness),  wish  (madness).  My  body  is  gold.  With  the light of recovery as a guide, may the strife here not end.]"
<p class="calibre1">Long light red hair tied into two bundles, battle attire is a white top with a red nurse's outfit  (nurse  dress),  wearing  a  pitiful  amount  of  defense  gear  on  top.  The  only young  girl  dressed  differently  from  the  other  healers  and  pharmacists,  Haider Velvet held a long staff with golden decorations and wove a spell in a loud voice.
<p class="calibre1">The battlefield was strewn with corpses, and in the middle of it unfolded a huge golden magic formation.
<p class="calibre1">The unbelievable size of the spell caused the adventurers to stop moving, when she spoke the name of the spell.
<p class="calibre1">"[Zeo-Gurvig]"
<p class="calibre1">Super wide area recovery magic.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p131"></a>The  girl  who  had  supported  the  "Baptism"  of  the  "Battle  Wilderness"  by  herself unleashed her power - the strong warriors who had fallen to the ground were truly
<p class="calibre1">"revived".
<p class="calibre1">"What?
<p class="calibre1">Bathed in the golden-colored magic light from the ground, the carbonized human bodies and the frostbite of the frozen orcs were all restored to their previous state.
<p class="calibre1">The  dwarves  and  amazons  pressed  their  cut  off  arms  or  legs  to  the  wounded surface, and the magic steam rose up, while the arms and legs returned to their original state.
<p class="calibre1">It was like undead creatures, slowly, slowly.
<p class="calibre1">The warriors got up one after another, watching Bors and the others in awe and speechlessness.
<p class="calibre1">"Freya-sama  gave  permission.  From  now  on,  this  is  another  『Battle Wilderness』.
<p class="calibre1">The adventurers' time seemed to have come to a standstill.
<p class="calibre1">The party who created this scene, Haider, let the wind bring the words.
<p class="calibre1">"Welcome, you brave barbarians."
<p class="calibre1">Contrary to her words.
<p class="calibre1">With cold pupils of her eyes, she looked at the warriors not as if they were insects, but as if they were insects.
<p class="calibre1">The gaze of a "cruel enemy" that was alien to the healer and that the boy (Bell) had not seen before.
<p class="calibre1">The beautiful girl with the appearance of a goddess pronounced a death sentence.
<p class="calibre1">"May the struggle bless you."
<p class="calibre1">The  eyes  of  the  strong  warriors  who  had  completed  their  resurrection  shone violently.
<p class="calibre1">"Quickly, quickly use the magic sword!
<p class="calibre1">The little man (Lily) shouted.
<p class="calibre1">"It's too late."
<p class="calibre1">So asserted the elf (Hedin).
<p class="calibre1">"Go on, tough warrior."
<p class="calibre1">On behalf of the Goddess, the Witch (Haydée) sent down an oracle.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p132"></a>The second advance.
<p class="calibre1">This time, the  army's assault  was  carried out by a death-defying force, and this time it really bit the coalition of factions.
<p class="calibre1">"The second attack was a surprise attack (with power), and this time it really bit the faction.
<p class="calibre1">Bors's shout was swallowed up by the fierce battle cry.
<p class="calibre1">The  first  assault  had  shortened  the  distance  by  more  than  half,  and  the  tough warriors  charged  through  the  remaining  distance  in  one  breath,  then  took advantage of the momentum to swing their swords, spears, axes, and hammers in unison.
<p class="calibre1">The front guard shields of the allied warlords scrambled to set up their shields, and the two clashed fiercely.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment he caught the enemy's surprise attack, Dormul shouted.
<p class="calibre1">The surface of the shield changed shape, and the huge Dwarven body, which was incredibly heavy after counting the equipment, stepped backwards.
<p class="calibre1">"Can't catch, can't catch!?"
<p class="calibre1">The antagonism was just a moment.
<p class="calibre1">Dormul their [Magni familia] defense was torn to pieces and flew backwards.
<p class="calibre1">"Welp - uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
<p class="calibre1">The downfall of the front guard shield post being broken through was destined to be an instant explosion of lamentations from the adventurers.
<p class="calibre1">Facing  the  tough  warriors  who  launched  the  attack,  the  defenses  shattered, weapons were broken, and in an instant, blood danced wildly. After that, it was all about the usual scenes. Level and ability value of these cruel numbers so that low-level adventurers know what exactly is ravaged.
<p class="calibre1">Humans were cut down. The orcs were stabbed through and through. Elfs became bait for the hand swords, and the Amazons were swept away. Breached  by the other side, falling to the ground, Dormul the dwarves became the mat, the whole body was trampled by countless iron boots, blood splashed everywhere.
<p class="calibre1">Confusion  and  panic  dominated  the  faction  warlord  alliance,  the  troops disintegrated in one breath.
<p class="calibre1">"Asshole!"
<p class="calibre1">Seeing this one-sided melee, the roar of Aisha, who was wielding a big plain sword, resounded all around.
<p class="calibre1">The right flank, the left flank, and the center were all in the same state of semi-destruction after just one clash. The front line including the front guard shield post
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p133"></a>was gnawed away, and the enemy's fangs might even touch the magicians in the rear and the reserve group hiding Haruhime.
<p class="calibre1">Some adventurers even shot『Crozzo's magic sword』in spite of the fact that it would affect their companions, but to no avail. Even if one of the corners was blown away,  the  [Freya  Families]  didn't  stop,  they  unsurprisingly  threw  off  their  fallen companions and split the enemy along with the magic sword. It was a nightmare to send the three adventurers of the Allied Forces of the Valve to meet them all together, and the strong warriors were able to defeat them all with just one person.
<p class="calibre1">This is the law of 'quality' over 'quantity' as revealed in the Age of God.
<p class="calibre1">A  strong  man  (high  ranker)  can  rule  the  battlefield  with  more  than  a  hundred soldiers.
<p class="calibre1">Faced with an opponent whose "skill" and "strategy" were stronger than their own, the adventurers of the United Faction were helpless.
<p class="calibre1">"......! Everyone, even the lowest ranking soldiers!
<p class="calibre1">Mikoto, who had nothing to do but concentrate  on  dodging,  endured the blades swinging from all sides and shouted.
<p class="calibre1">She was no longer an open-minded 'samurai' or 'swordsman', but a 'ninja' who was driving her to live here, and she was not even allowed to do that. Smoke bombs, grenades, and even throwing props such as "Akatsuki". The weapons and props she had prepared beforehand were used in a flurry.
<p class="calibre1">Finally, she cut down a man and avenged her death, but the feedback in her hand told her that it was only a low-level adventurer of Lv. 1. The merciless truth made her freeze, and then she was nearly cut off again, and was forced to keep fighting with shock and anxiety.
<p class="calibre1">"The strongest faction".
<p class="calibre1">The meaning of this should be very clear, but now it has become a threat beyond recognition, making the girls tremble.
<p class="calibre1">"Haruhime-sama, use Rank Ascension! For Aisha-sama, Mikoto-sama, Daphne-sama, Bors-sama, and Welf-sama!
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, yes!"
<p class="calibre1">While the faction valve union was being eaten away, Lily didn't stay idle either.
<p class="calibre1">The  number  of『Tails』that  were  put  in  was  five.  After  sublimation,  Haruhime's
<p class="calibre1">[Nine Heavy] limit rose to six, and her spiritual power increased. After using five during the "Lower Level" expedition, she fell into mental fatigue, but now she didn't need to worry about that. In order to barely maintain the battle line, Lily used "Foul Move" without regret.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p134"></a>[Magic  Guides]  Start  shelling  too!  [Selket  Familia]  to  [Naderi  Familia],  please concentrate your fire on the central area!!!
<p class="calibre1">And [Commanding thought].
<p class="calibre1">The  new  『Skill』  that  appears  together  with  the  sublimation  has  the  effect  of enhancing the ability to spread after shouting above a certain level.
<p class="calibre1">That is, the louder the shout, the more the voice of the commander (Lily) can be conveyed  to  the  target,  even  if  this  is  a  fierce  battlefield.  In  this  way,  to  send instructions to those who did not get the eye crystal can use this to compensate.
<p class="calibre1">At the end of the troops overlooking the  battlefield, Lily  stood on the roof of the huge tomb, while using the eye crystal and『Skill』to keep giving instructions.
<p class="calibre1">However, the anxiety on her face didn't fade away.
<p class="calibre1">"The『Magic Sword』was fired by the inducement ......! No, it was wasted!"
<p class="calibre1">The  opening  of  the  battle  was  accompanied  by  a  surprise  attack  by  the  Tough Warriors.
<p class="calibre1">At first glance, it looks very tactless, but it is actually a trap to make your side use
<p class="calibre1">『Crozzo's Magic Sword』.
<p class="calibre1">Hedin shouldn't  have underestimated the threat posed by the  『Magic Sword』
<p class="calibre1">created  by  Welf  and  the  [Hephaestus  Familia],  and  had  been  on  guard.  First consumed  some  limited  number  of  『Magic  Sword』,  and  then  made  the cinderellas  with  full  Bellies  erase  the  loss  of  soldiers.  There  was  even  a  strong counterattack attached.
<p class="calibre1">(The Cinderellas with full Bellies ...... are just as tricky as Finn-sama said!!!) What should have been a completely victorious outpost was turned upside down by them - a young girl, to be precise.
<p class="calibre1">The military power that defies death, and the healing power that is one of the best in the city. Without one of them, it would be impossible to carry out the tactics that only [Freya's Familia] is qualified to do.
<p class="calibre1">"But, this has revealed the location ......!
<p class="calibre1">Like the enemy's first level adventurers, the Cinderellas with full stomachs were the highest priority targets to be defeated.
<p class="calibre1">Let this already miserable plate as the price, no matter what, to crush the Haider girls, Lily reached her hand to the eye crystal that had remained silent so far.
<p class="calibre1">"Luvis-sama, and Mord-sama! Please!"
<p class="calibre1">It didn't take long for the well-trained 'ambushers' to roar.
<p class="calibre1">"Okay!"
<p class="calibre1">"Ready to go out, everyone!
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p135"></a>In  front  of  the  base  camp,  the  two  sides  were  fighting,  while  the  full-Bellied Cinderellas were equipped on the northwest side away from here, and just to their side, Mord and the others violently lifted their cloaks and lifted their『Transparent Status』.
<p class="calibre1">Fellows' magic prop『Reverse Spirit Veil』.
<p class="calibre1">Lily gave it to the reconstituted guerrillas and told them to hide. Let them go around to the outside of the main battlefield where the two armies were facing each other as  an『ambush』for  the  purpose  of  crushing  the  Cinderellas  who  had  full stomachs only.
<p class="calibre1">"I've been waiting for you to show yourselves!
<p class="calibre1">The Morde, who was cautiously approaching without being detected by the enemy, did not miss the opportunity to run.
<p class="calibre1">Almost all the enemies were thrown into the front line in order to bite away from the cross line of the allied faction warlords.
<p class="calibre1">Separated  by  segments  of  the  rear  guard,  the  full-Bellied  cinderellas  were  not surrounded by escorts.
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  the  isolated  healing  troops,  Mord  licked  his  tongue  and  pulled  out  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">『Magic Sword』that he was carrying with force.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">The three bursts of inflammation released by Mord, Guile and Scott engulfed the full-Bellied Cinderellas completely.
<p class="calibre1">"One more ahhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
<p class="calibre1">The  rough  and  tumble  men  fired  "Clouzot's  Magic  Sword"  one  after  another, vowing to destroy the pretty-faced maidens.
<p class="calibre1">The gods in the city where the Mirror was broadcasting the images were booing, unaware of the fact that they were bathed in uninterrupted shelling.
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, hey! Did you go too far?
<p class="calibre1">"What the hell is too much for the Freya Familia! If you can't use the Magic Sword, let us use it! Just watch!"
<p class="calibre1">The scene was so heartless that the elf Luvis shouted a reminder, but Mord turned a deaf ear to it.
<p class="calibre1">Mord's heart was burning.
<p class="calibre1">This  is  not  out  of  any  justice  and  courage,  hidden  in  his  heart  is  the  passion  of
<p class="calibre1">"being able to help" just one teenager.
<p class="calibre1">The lawless one was unusually brave, as if he was saying that he wanted to pay back the favor he had done so far.
<p class="calibre1">"We have to help Bell Cranel!
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p136"></a>The feeling of omnipotence brought by "Clouzot's Magic Sword" also pushed him to create a lot of explosive flames.
<p class="calibre1">The  roar  of  flames  eventually  turned  into  a  sea  of  red  lotuses,  burning  up  the Cinderellas with full Bellies.
<p class="calibre1">It was a perfect surprise attack, and they simply had no time to dodge it. In the face of such firepower, there was no point in defending.
<p class="calibre1">With a snap, the sword produced cracks and the 『Magic Sword』 was about to reach  its  limit,  when  Molde,  who  was  breathing  heavily,  finally  stopped  their shelling.
<p class="calibre1">"No  matter  how  good  you  are  at  replying,  you  won't  even  be  able  to  use  your
<p class="calibre1">"magic" if you are under concentrated fire! I'll go straight to hell!
<p class="calibre1">Molde showed a smug smile and put the magic sword against his shoulder.
<p class="calibre1">In the sea of flames, there was no one left standing.
<p class="calibre1">The roar of burning roared on the battlefield.
<p class="calibre1">Even Hedin in the position was watching from the sidelines. As if unnecessary.
<p class="calibre1">Finally, like Luvis and the others, Mord frowned at the unpleasant smell of burnt meat and said, "Is it really a bit too much ......? At the same time, he blocked his nose with his stout arm -
<p class="calibre1">"I think it will be there, aiming at our 『ambushers』.
<p class="calibre1">And  then  stopped  moving  because  of  the  voice  coming  from  the  depths  of  the flames.
<p class="calibre1">"But what about it?"
<p class="calibre1">A young girl slowly peeled her body away from the hot earth and stood up.
<p class="calibre1">"What!?"
<p class="calibre1">Mord and Luvis doubted their eyes.
<p class="calibre1">The young girl was burning.
<p class="calibre1">All of her protective gear was broken, her clothes were burning and falling, and her snow-white skin was tinged with a fiery red.
<p class="calibre1">In a sea of blazing flames, karma tortured her, ugly burn marks thrown in crawling all over her body.
<p class="calibre1">Then, in turn, they were repaired.
<p class="calibre1">"[Asa Gurvig] - unfortunately, my 『Magic』 has been activated.
<p class="calibre1">The light of gold forced back the fierce fire.
<p class="calibre1">A pattern of light like a miniature magic array appeared on the young girl's skin.
<p class="calibre1">"Mo, Mord! That guy, it's like ......!
<p class="calibre1">"The one on the 18th floor!
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p137"></a>What came back to the minds of the pale Guyer and Scott was the "Black Goliath"
<p class="calibre1">that they had fought with Bell and the others.
<p class="calibre1">The  floor  master  who  was  able  to  repair  his  body  by  relying  on  『self-regeneration』  even  though  he  was  attacked  by  all  of  the  magicians  was  too similar to the 『Nightmare』 in front of him.
<p class="calibre1">"Auto-heal".
<p class="calibre1">The regeneration effect that continues to heal damage for a certain period of time.
<p class="calibre1">Before  being  attacked  by  Mord  and  them,  the  moment  before  going  to  the battlefield, Haider used this  『Magic』 for all the Cinderella's with full stomachs including herself.
<p class="calibre1">As if following the maiden, the healers and medicine men who had fallen to the ground stood up one by one.
<p class="calibre1">"How is it possible ......?
<p class="calibre1">Is this sight of rebirth by fire, an undead bird, or a walking corpse recovering from a cremation?
<p class="calibre1">As particles of golden light appeared, the burned skin had become hydrated again.
<p class="calibre1">The two hairpins tied to the hair were burned away, and even the long hair that had been burned by the flames in passing was immediately repaired.
<p class="calibre1">The flames that were gaining momentum could not outweigh the amount of 'magic'
<p class="calibre1">returned, and now there was not a single burn on her body. The flame groaned, and all it could do now was burn up her clothes and humiliate the girl.
<p class="calibre1">What little was left of her battle attire had lost most of its coverage, her shoulders and  navel,  her  supple  waist  and  thighs,  even  the  lower  half  of  her  beautifully shaped breasts were exposed.
<p class="calibre1">However, no one would ever lust after her.
<p class="calibre1">After  all,  the  Haider  who  was  holding  a  staff  alone  and  advancing  through  the karmic fire was too sacred.
<p class="calibre1">"You, you monsters!!!"
<p class="calibre1">"Mord! Stop it now!"
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  with  his  own  eyes  the  "rare  magic"  that  only  the  members  of  the  Freya Familia could learn about the faction valve, Mordel's blood rushed up like he was giving up on himself.
<p class="calibre1">He ignored the voices of Guile and the others to stop him, and slashed at Haider who came out of the flames.
<p class="calibre1">"Just smash the magic sword (this guy) right in-!
<p class="calibre1">He  swung  『Crozzo's  Magic  Sword』  to  his  back  and  was  about  to  fire  it  at extremely close range.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p138"></a>"It's ugly."
<p class="calibre1">However, the long staff held tightly in the girl's hand flashed by at high speed.
<p class="calibre1">"Gooooooooo!
<p class="calibre1">The staff was raised high and swung down like a war hammer, knocking the man to the ground.
<p class="calibre1">The shattered slab of stone came into close contact with his face, and Mord rolled his eyes and lost consciousness.
<p class="calibre1">"What a filth. I can't watch it. It's just too unpleasant."
<p class="calibre1">After a boom, the ground dented, and Guyer, Scott and Luvis were all speechless when the girl lifted one foot and stomped the magic sword that had rolled to the ground.
<p class="calibre1">"I can't understand why a straw man of your caliber would want to reBell against the Great Goddess. Why do you want to sully the mighty light of that lord ...... are your brains still sane!"
<p class="calibre1">She lifted her bowed head and removed the dark curtain of bangs, only to see that the bright red eyes were boarding with flames of rage.
<p class="calibre1">"Shame on you, you traitors! You filthy minions who resist the will of the goddess!

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/VJ7Zmdz/171987.jpg" alt="171987" border="0"></a>

<p class="calibre1">"Not a single drop of spittle, not even the stench of your filthy eyes, will touch the Goddess!
<p class="calibre1">Her  usual  gentle  demeanor  completely  disappeared,  revealing  an  agitated  tone and angry expression.
<p class="calibre1">If Bell were here, I'm afraid she would be scared to death by this sudden change of personality, but this is nothing, it's just that the young girl is also a 'worshiper of the goddess of beauty' just like the other members of the group.
<p class="calibre1">This reverence of Haider, who was saved by the goddess and offered her loyalty to the goddess, was enough to be compared to 『Wild Faith Goddess (Horn)』.
<p class="calibre1">"All for Freya-sama - disappear, adventurers!
<p class="calibre1">Driven by her emotions, the girl showed her killing intent and battle intent.
<p class="calibre1">What began immediately was a mere "annihilation".
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!?"
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p139"></a>Without giving Guyer and Scott a chance to use their 『Magic Sword』, the long staff  swept  and  sent  both  of  them  flying.  The  arrow  that  Luvis  shot  out  sharply pierced  the  young  girl's  shoulder,  but  that  was  all.  After  pulling  out  the  arrow without a single wound on it, Luvis' face first twitched, and then lost consciousness from the long staff swung.
<p class="calibre1">With strength and movements that were nothing like a healer's, Haider knocked the rest of the elfs (Modi familiars) into the ground as well.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">A healer was ravaging the upper level adventurers led by Lv. 3.
<p class="calibre1">However,  it  was  not  the  people  or  the  adventurers  who  were  particularly dumbfounded by the sight of the mirror reflecting this beyond common sense.
<p class="calibre1">It was a fellow healer who was sweating coldly.
<p class="calibre1">"Haider-Velvet ......"
<p class="calibre1">Among  the  [Dian  Cecht  Familia],  who  had  avoided  the  war  games,  [Battlefield Saint] Airmid Teasanare narrowed her eyes in fear.
<p class="calibre1">Airmid, who was known as the best healer in the city, and Haider.
<p class="calibre1">There was a time when people called the two as 『Saint of Silver』 and 『Golden Witch』 respectively, after the 『Two Great Healers』 that Orario was proud of.
<p class="calibre1">In  fact,  they  also  occupy  the  top  two  positions  in  the  healer  sequence,  and  the difference between them is first of all the "response range".
<p class="calibre1">Airmid is also able to launch a wide range of recovery magic, but Haider, who has been trained in the "Battle Wilderness", is not at all on the same level. Although the healing effect and power is better than the other side, Haider should have an advantage in terms of durability.
<p class="calibre1">In addition, another decisive difference is - the pure combat ability.
<p class="calibre1">Amid's level of white-knuckle combat is still not above that of a healer, but unlike her, Haider can kill second-level adventurers by herself alone.
<p class="calibre1">"Her origins as a healer are simply too unusual ......"
<p class="calibre1">That  was  the  rumor  that  the  saintly  girl  had  heard,  and  at  the  same  time  the conclusive truth.
<p class="calibre1">The girl who had been baptized in the 『Battle Wilderness』 as a strong warrior herself - just like a certain 『abandoned cat』 - felt despair after knowing that she had reached her limit as a warrior. However, with her loyalty to the god of beauty, she became a healer and revealed the golden talent hidden in her body.
<p class="calibre1">Her current [Ability Value] is Lv. 4.
<p class="calibre1">The alias she received was - [Goddess's Gold (Warner Mardel)].
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p140"></a>This is the name that the gods praised her for the glory of her magic power, her will to never tolerate death, and her vitality, and she is a true warrior girl (Valkyrie) who is in charge of life and death.
<p class="calibre1">"The [Freya Familia] is a special Familia bred from a cruel environment ....... Like the first level adventurers, the faction alliance has no chance of winning unless she is eliminated ......"
<p class="calibre1">While the surrounding healers of their own faction valve were trembling with fear, the saintly woman said softly with absolute certainty.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Oh no! If this continues ......!"
<p class="calibre1">This realization was also very clear to Daphne.
<p class="calibre1">" Liliruca, can't the other guerrillas be sent over there!
<p class="calibre1">"They've  already  been  sent!  But,  the  amount  of  [Goddess's  Gold]'s  reply  is  too abnormal! It can't be beaten!
<p class="calibre1">From the gap of the strong warriors who swarmed, one could vaguely see deep in the  field  of  vision,  besides  the  all-destroyed  Mord  and  them,  there  were  other guerrillas who also launched attacks, but they still couldn't defeat the full-Bellied Cinderellas. Other healers and pharmacists also made unusual movements, the guerrillas  were  slow  to  defeat  them,  were  left  in  the  enemy  base  camp  and  the magicians seized the opportunity to fight all over the body.
<p class="calibre1">The eye crystal hanging around her waist truthfully conveyed Lily's anxiety.
<p class="calibre1">"If we don't stop the Cinderellas with full stomachs, they will be turned into invisible no matter how they fight ......!
<p class="calibre1">Now the enemy group members that were hard to defeat are also, as soon as the Haider girls move, they will be revived. Having gained the boon of level ascension, it is simply a nightmare to have the first person (like this) so easily, only to have it revived again and again.
<p class="calibre1">She couldn't go and blame Lily who made the surprise attack end in failure for her incompetence. Since the opponent was hiding a move like 『auto-healing』, the only effective strategy of 『defeating before using healing magic』 was no longer there. If Daphne had been in Lily's position, she would have turned the board over and vented everywhere.
<p class="calibre1">"Can we attack the Cinderellas with full Bellies from the right flank?
<p class="calibre1">"Don't be so hard on yourself ......! It's hard enough to maintain the battle line on this side!
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of the chaos, she commanded the right flank troops while bouncing off a  lance  strike  with  her  short  sword  "Fencer-Laureate".  The  grade  sublimated
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p141"></a>particles of light adhered to her whole body and let out a glow like a soft moan, barely repelling the enemy. It was just as well that there was no time to breathe at all.
<p class="calibre1">"[Sol's Light]!
<p class="calibre1">Even so, Daphne and the girls were still doing well.
<p class="calibre1">Ouka, Chigusa and Bors were surrounding the healer (Cassandra) in the center, fighting desperately.
<p class="calibre1">Like Daphne, the girl had also reached Lv. 3 after the "expedition" in the "lower level", and her recovery magic was in full effect, causing the adventurers to regroup after nearly collapsing several times.
<p class="calibre1">On both sides, it happened that the enemy healers were tormented and saved by their own healers.
<p class="calibre1">And the cruel thing is that in the healer duel, the faction warlords have no chance to win.
<p class="calibre1">"It  would  be  bad  if  the  enemy's  base  camp,  the  magicians  also  came  up!  Once they  are  in  the  range  of  "magic",  they  will  be  finished!  We  have  to  get  the Cinderella's with full stomachs before then..."
<p class="calibre1">When Daphne, who had not even had time to wipe off her sweat, kept fighting, she said to her eyes.
<p class="calibre1">"『!
<p class="calibre1">Lily's breathing stopped instantly, as if someone had grabbed her neck on the other side of the crystal.
<p class="calibre1">A moment later, Daphne understood what this meant.
<p class="calibre1">"----"
<p class="calibre1">Her vision deepened as she stopped moving.
<p class="calibre1">Far behind the enemy line in front of her, countless spears of "Thunderbolt" were aiming at Daphne and the girls.
<p class="calibre1">"You seem to have misunderstood. ...... It's been in my 'range' for a long time.
<p class="calibre1">Daphne's face turned blue.
<p class="calibre1">She had heard the white elf's unlikely murmur and realized her own fault.
<p class="calibre1">At the time of the battle, the enemy was too wary of  『Crozzo's Magic Sword』
<p class="calibre1">and didn't hold back. The spacing was wrong.
<p class="calibre1">That's how it seemed to Daphne and the girls.
<p class="calibre1">But that's not true.
<p class="calibre1">It's just that the enemy, the enemy commander (Hedin), didn't attack in order to make "Clouzot's Magic Sword" spit fire.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p142"></a>The main battlefield in this area that turned into a 『Battle Wilderness』 was within the range of that first rank adventurer from the beginning!
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Will die - [Karus Hild]"
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Fire.
<p class="calibre1">Numerous  lightning  bullets  illuminated  the  faces  of  the  adventurers  who  were frozen in place, arcing through the air and pouring onto the battlefield.
<p class="calibre1">"KAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!
<p class="calibre1">The  countless  thunderbolts  flying  from  overhead  hit  the  adventurers  like  a bombardment.
<p class="calibre1">The thunderbolts that plunged the battlefield into chaos were themselves a vicious corps. The humans who were running randomly were shot through mercilessly, the orcs were lifted up along with the earth beneath their feet, and the Amazons who were protecting their companions were paralyzed by electricity.
<p class="calibre1">This 『Ultra Precision Shot』 didn't even graze a [Freya's Familia].
<p class="calibre1">As an archer, the Elf Eye accurately captured every detail of the battlefield and only shot through the enemy soldiers, in addition to destroying all the remaining
<p class="calibre1">『Magic Swords』.
<p class="calibre1">"Protect Cassandra!
<p class="calibre1">"Uh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh!
<p class="calibre1">Bathed in a rain of thunderbolts, Daphne shouted out at the top of her lungs.
<p class="calibre1">Hearing  the  sad  decision  to  give  up  maintaining  the  battle  line  and  prioritize protecting the squad's lifeline, Ouka and Bors, who were holding large shields, and the residents of the hotel street were ready to fight for their lives and agreed to do so. In front of the sight of Cassandra, who was pinned to the ground by Chigusa, countless  lightning  bombs  clashed  with  several  shields  and  ravaged  the surroundings.
<p class="calibre1">Pillars  and  rubble  were  split  in  pieces,  stone  fragments  were  swept  into  the  air, and the battlefield was tragically divided.
<p class="calibre1">"The exaggerated number of 『Magic Swords』 was already much less. It's time."
<p class="calibre1">The white elf, who had created such a tragic situation all by himself, declared coldly as a large amount of smoke dominated the battlefield along with the slashing magic current.
<p class="calibre1">"The countdown to the 'true Luvishment' has begun.
<p class="calibre1">"It's your turn, beasts. Let's go."
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p143"></a>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"That  kind  of  power  can  be  hit  from  so  far  away?  You're  really  exaggerating  as usual. ......!"
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  the  battlefield  reflected  in  the  "mirror",  the  twin  sister  Tionne  said  with hatred.
<p class="calibre1">The range was easily over 500M, and the scale was enough to defeat at least two hundred enemy troops.
<p class="calibre1">Even the largest faction (Loki Familia) was worthy of being chilled by the curtain of thunder that buried most of their vision in smoke and dust.
<p class="calibre1">"[White Demon Wand] Hedin Selander ...... In terms of effective range, his magic is considered the number one in Orario."
<p class="calibre1">"Eh~! But, isn't Riveria even stronger than him! After all, they call you the 'strongest magician in the city'!
<p class="calibre1">"Whether  or  not  this  perception  is  correct  depends  on  which  aspect  is  being evaluated. At the extreme, I would lose to Hedin in a shootout at long range, or if I was dragged into a white-knuckle fight.
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Riveria's calm analysis, Tiona offered her opinion unconvincingly, but the royal familia shook her emerald hair and spoke the truth lightly.
<p class="calibre1">【Nine Demon Princess】Riveria Leos Alph's strength is the power of magic and the  many  attribute  magic  (hand)  that  covers  attack,  defense  and  support.  As  a general speaking 『Back-up Magician』, her ability is so excellent that others can't even compare to it.
<p class="calibre1">However, Hedin is a "Magic Swordsman" who is the best in close combat as well.
<p class="calibre1">In the end, the basis of comparison between the two is different.
<p class="calibre1">He is the ideal target for the upper level center guard because he is the best in white knuckle combat technique and the speedy shooter brought by super short text chanting.
<p class="calibre1">Not only that, but as shown in the current war game, his range and power itself is also very exaggerated.
<p class="calibre1">『Destroying  the  military  power  of  tens  of  thousands  of  people  by  just  using magic』.
<p class="calibre1">There were rumors of this from the Desert Sea, and I don't know if they were true or not.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p144"></a>If I were to find a word to accurately describe him, it would undoubtedly be 'magic cannon swordsman'.
<p class="calibre1">"What's  more,  the  total  amount  of  spiritual  power  ......  Hedin's  magic  sustaining ability is undoubtedly stronger than mine.
<p class="calibre1">The  spiritual  power  required  to  use  magic  was  strong  enough  to  make  the strongest magician in the city (Riveria) clearly admit that he was not as good as him.
<p class="calibre1">The pop-ups from all corners of the brigade and the calm faces that hadn't shed a drop of sweat so far proved this thing.
<p class="calibre1">The Amazon sisters' faces were full of defiance, while Riveria narrowed her eyes.
<p class="calibre1">"Together  with  the  other  elfs,  the  two  are  known  as  the  'White  and  Black  Twin Riders' ......"
<p class="calibre1">It's coming, she said.
<p class="calibre1">The emerald pupils looked sharply into the depths of the Mirror, and the sand and dust that covered the sky was about to dissipate.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
<p class="calibre1">"Gooooooooooo!
<p class="calibre1">A sharp slash split [Freya's Familia] apart.
<p class="calibre1">While most of the adventurers belonging to the faction's allied forces were pushed back, Tsubaki Kobold wiped his blood and dust-stained face carelessly and bravely moved into the middle of the battlefield.
<p class="calibre1">"Don't be afraid! If three people can't do it, the five people will do it together! If even five of you can't stop it, then ten of you! As long as you buy time, I can take the opportunity to clean them all up!
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the angry shout of the Lv.5 top level forger, the surrounding adventurers boiled with "oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
<p class="calibre1">This was the central unit. Tsubaki couldn't conduct decent command, so she chose to  become  a  martial  artist  who  kept  killing  the  enemy.  Although  she  was  a tenacious and tough warrior, she could only fall to her knees in front of her whose strength reached the level of the first level adventurer.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p145"></a>She  cut  down  countless  enemies  already,  and  around  her,  several  warriors wearing equipment also fell to the ground.
<p class="calibre1">(But, it was still really bad! The enemy's momentum didn't let up at all! I don't even know how many of their companions I cut down, yet they don't care and still attack!) There was sweat dripping down from Tsubaki's face like this.
<p class="calibre1">What didn't come out of her mouth was the curse 'this group of hungry ghosts who are thirsty for battle'.
<p class="calibre1">(And  as  long  as  that  group  of  healers  are  still  around,  these  guys  lying  on  the ground  will  recover  ......!  Alas,  this  place  is  more  dangerous  than  the  deep (dungeon)!
<p class="calibre1">That's  why  [Freya's  Familia]  is  hard  to  deal  with,  she  couldn't  help  but  whisper bitterly.
<p class="calibre1">At  the  same  time  the  upper  level  forgers'  『Magic  Swords』  were  supporting, making her struggle barely so far, but Hedin's shelling just now had erased most of  it.  Now  that  the  view  was  blocked  by  sand  and  dust,  it  was  not  right  to  fire continuously,  but  to  really  eat  that  move  again,  the  morale  of  your  side  would definitely fall. Tsubaki may not be able to hold up either.
<p class="calibre1">In that case, we can only take advantage of the fact that the sand and dust have not  yet  disbursed,  even  if  it  is  the  same  death  to  cut  down  the  full-Bellied cinderellas.
<p class="calibre1">Just when Tsubaki was about to decide which side to choose.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">A "sound" burst out.
<p class="calibre1">It wasn't the cry of the person being cut, but a creepy "chopping sound".
<p class="calibre1">"---"
<p class="calibre1">Tsubaki didn't hear it wrong.
<p class="calibre1">The sound of a weapon flashing that only a fierce 'user' could play.
<p class="calibre1">"---Hogni!!!"
<p class="calibre1">She turned violently to the west.
<p class="calibre1">Deep in the fading sand and dust stood a black elf.
<p class="calibre1">"Her, Hogni Ragnar!?"
<p class="calibre1">"First-class adventurer!
<p class="calibre1">"And, it's really here ......!"
<p class="calibre1">Tsubaki's  shout  became  the  trigger,  and  the  adventurers'  cries  of  woe  streaked overhead.
<p class="calibre1">The silver hair that looks like lavender and the brown skin that shows its black elf identity.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p146"></a>The lacquered black sword carried was stained with blood, and the sharp pupils dripped  with  stupidity  as  if  they  were  now  also  looking  for  prey.  A  cold  smile appeared on his face, it seems he was thirsting for a blood feast after all.
<p class="calibre1">The confrontation with the first level adventurer. The common perception that any adventurer would feel desperate caused the faction warlord alliance to falter.
<p class="calibre1">As for Hogni himself.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">(Ahhhhhhhhh ...... unrecognizable guy is looking at me ahhhhhh ......!!!) I was in a panic.
<p class="calibre1">And it was extreme panic.
<p class="calibre1">The dangerous eyes that are slithering are not wanting to meet the eyes of others, and the sneer that emerges is just a twitch of the cheeks and a lift of the corners of the mouth. The heart of the elf, who is extremely sensitive to life and has almost no communication skills, is beating violently, turning into a monster with suspicious behavior.
<p class="calibre1">(No, I can't, I must, I must pull myself together ......! I'm from Freya-sama's familia, and I'm also a very powerful first-class adventurer in Orario ......! (Mocking me is equivalent to insulting [the Familia] as well as Freya-sama ......!
<p class="calibre1">He forcibly lifted his lips, and incidentally also lifted his entire twitching face.
<p class="calibre1">An evil smile that was so tense that it was extremely intense emerged from Hogni.
<p class="calibre1">"............ Ku, Ku Ku Ku, to meet my abyss here is the final destiny ...... eternal dead skeleton silent, the crimson color released a loud song... ...my sword thirsts for a living sacrifice. Both ............ go go go go and die."
<p class="calibre1">Hogni was emboldened by the countless eyes surrounding him, while uttering the above words, which, if paraphrased, would be 'This force is in my charge, therefore I have come to expel you. I have already been killed in, and the outpost is over.
<p class="calibre1">Prepare to die." .
<p class="calibre1">The  response  from  the  side  of  the  allied  forces  of  the  faction  warlords  was  a tragedy.
<p class="calibre1">"Whoa, what's wrong with this guy!
<p class="calibre1">"Suddenly opened his mouth and scared me, but he turned out to be a great guy!
<p class="calibre1">"I can't understand how this guy is!
<p class="calibre1">"Obviously an elf, but also like an evil spirit to make what evil smile!
<p class="calibre1">"Apologize! Apologize to the elf!"
<p class="calibre1">"Why is this guy a first-class adventurer?
<p class="calibre1">(Ah, no, I want to die.)
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p147"></a>A glittering liquid appeared in the corner of the black elf's eyes.
<p class="calibre1">(Don't ah don't look at me like that ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah. No, no, no, no, no, no. In the end why ah really why I am the first level adventurer ah, I simply do not want to be seen well want to blend into the darkness to fight, rather than say I so want to become darkness well want to become the embodiment of darkness. (No can ah can not ah so hard ah so want to nest inside the forest ah ah can't stand it so want to enjoy Freya-sama's knee pillow - no if I want to give Freya-sama knee pillow.)
<p class="calibre1">Hogni tried hard.
<p class="calibre1">The  pressure  of  the  sight  was  endured,  as  well  as  their  own  delusions  of victimization, and desperately tried.
<p class="calibre1">However, at the thought of this super cold and stupid look being broadcasted to the  whole  of  Orauli  by  『Mirror』,  his  mental  balance  became  shattered  and  a tragic end came. The extreme shame burned his spirit and made him decide to practice a humiliating escape.
<p class="calibre1">(It doesn't work anymore ...... Sure enough, let's use it.) That is, use 『magic』.
<p class="calibre1">"[Unsheathe your sword, the King of Magic Swords, Fai (King)]"
<p class="calibre1">Like a knight, or rather to block the face, the sword was held in both hands, and the tip of the sword pointed to the sky.
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, a black magic formation bloomed under his feet.
<p class="calibre1">"What the...? Stop him from chanting!
<p class="calibre1">Seeing this sight, Tsubaki shouted in spite of everything.
<p class="calibre1">The comical play made her freeze for just a moment, and the moment she heard the spell, the biggest alarm Bell rang in her head.
<p class="calibre1">She  knew  exactly  what  the  source  of  Hogni's  『Alias』  was,  and  with  anxiety pulled out the short sword-type 『Magic Sword』 that was stuck in her waist.
<p class="calibre1">「[Reason  is  the  payment,  blood  is  the  sacrifice.  The  feast  does  not  stop  -  the killing does not stop]"
<p class="calibre1">The chant that was played was a short text chant. It's too late to cut through it.
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  Tsubaki's  action  taken  after  such  judgment,  the  other  adventurers  and forgers also paled and imitated her.
<p class="calibre1">Several  『Magic  swords』,  countless  arrows  and  hand  swords  were  shot  out towards Hogni who had his eyes closed.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Dainty Sleeves]"
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p148"></a>The magic name and the sound of explosion sounded at the same time.
<p class="calibre1">The unfolded magic formation was swallowed up by the shelling storm as soon as the light was released.
<p class="calibre1">The storm also concealed the Black Elf's figure and then exploded the flower of light.
<p class="calibre1">Looking at the fire that even the first level adventurers could not be safe, Tsubaki and the girls blocked their faces with their arms and watched nervously - and then saw the smoke of the rising explosion wavering for a moment.
<p class="calibre1">Then.
<p class="calibre1">"Kahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!
<p class="calibre1">A 'sound' burst out.
<p class="calibre1">It  was  enough  to  make  Tsubaki's  ears  tremble,  and  a  magnificent  'sound  of Luvishment' that excluded all the hands and mercy.
<p class="calibre1">"---"
<p class="calibre1">In front of Tsubaki's vision, who was dumbfounded, there was blood frothing in the corner of the troops.
<p class="calibre1">The ones who had fallen were three upper ranked adventurers.
<p class="calibre1">Standing next to them was a black elf, wrapped in the smoke of the explosion he had broken through, like an armor.
<p class="calibre1">"--The  reBells  who  disobeyed  the  goddess'  will.  I  have  come  to  hear  your repentance. The price is your living blood."
<p class="calibre1">The tone of voice was very different from earlier.
<p class="calibre1">The cruel gaze that had been weak earlier was gone.
<p class="calibre1">Tsubaki realized one thing, and he unleashed the 『magic』 that he must not let him activate.
<p class="calibre1">「[Daine Sleif】......! That『personality changing』magic that Hogni possesses!!!
<p class="calibre1">It  was  the  ritual  that  made  the  black  elf  who  was  afraid  of  other  people's  faces change into a 『warrior』, and it was also the key.
<p class="calibre1">This is neither a normal attack magic nor different from the empowerment magic, and the [Daine Sleif] that affects the heart of the caster is considered a rare magic.
<p class="calibre1">The effect is to make the personality and words and actions truly become another person.  In  the  "Goddess  Festival",  when  Bell  was  attacked  by  Hogni,  she wondered if she was the same person before and after, and it was all because of this "magic".
<p class="calibre1">But at the same time, it did not have any effect of increasing the ability value.
<p class="calibre1">It  only  worked  on  his  personality,  and  it  was  quite  insignificant  among  the magnificent "magic".
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p149"></a>"Switched to Black Demon's Sword (another) Hogni ......!
<p class="calibre1">However,  this  magic  that  works  exclusively  on  the  spirit  is  a  『self-transformation』 that goes beyond self-reference.
<p class="calibre1">In other words, the phenomenon it triggers is equivalent to "ideal embodiment".
<p class="calibre1">This is the "magic" that summons the strongest self (Hegyi), which is manifested because he has spurned himself too much.
<p class="calibre1">"I am tired of seeing the appearance of trembling. I give you mercy. Take up your swords. At least let you end up as swordsmen."
<p class="calibre1">--Sweat dripped down Tsubaki's cheeks.
<p class="calibre1">In the 'dark period' of Orauli, Hogni had used 'magic' to kill over a thousand evil apostles  in  just  one  battle.  Tsubaki  understood  the  power  of  that『magic』very well.
<p class="calibre1">The light from the shattered magic formation was sucked into his eyes, now taking on  a  light  purple  color  and  shining  with  a  demonic  glow,  Hogni  narrowed  those eyes and proclaimed.
<p class="calibre1">"Die, rabble. The vermin who hinder the love of the goddess have no right to live."
<p class="calibre1">In an instant, the black elf's body sank slightly.
<p class="calibre1">And  then  there  was  a  speedy  drive  that  was  mistaken  for  instantaneous movement.
<p class="calibre1">The moment I thought a black shadow swept by, an entire squad was cut off.
<p class="calibre1">"Ye-Ye-Ye-Ye-Ye-Ye!
<p class="calibre1">Just one swing of the sword.
<p class="calibre1">The spell sword in his hand expanded the "Chopping Range" and cut down all the adventurers with just a flash.
<p class="calibre1">The dance of despair and slashing was on.
<p class="calibre1">There was no hesitation and no forgiveness. The weakness (limiter) that prevented him from exerting his full power was completely removed by magic, and he became the incarnation of a slashing attack that his arch-enemies would call "the strongest shit elf in a white-knuckle fight among his fellow elfs". Just like the magic sword that will not return to its sheath until it is drawn and brings many deaths, it blows up a violent storm of blood.
<p class="calibre1">Adventurers were cleaved by it. The forgers  and their 'magic swords' were also destroyed together.
<p class="calibre1">This beheading does not distinguish between noble and lowly. It was like a tyrant declaring the end of the world like a tyrant, without distinction between men and women, without distinction between races, without distinction between young and old.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p150"></a>"It is not my job to call myself brutal. It is all because of your weakness.
<p class="calibre1">Hogni's alias [Black Demon Sword (Dainesleaf)] is a direct reference to his magic name.
<p class="calibre1">It  was  the  best  praise  offered  by  the  fervent  and  enthusiastic  gods  (fans)  who praised  him  who  had  transformed  from  a  'Dark  Knight  (laugh)'  to  a  true  'Dark Warlord'.
<p class="calibre1">Ten people, another ten people, he slaughtered the adventurers at a faster and faster speed.  Seeing the black elf change into the ruthless and cold,  killing and ravaging 『War King』, Tsubaki, who was one step away from him, said with a trembling voice.
<p class="calibre1">"...... Lily followers, add the one called level ascension to me.
<p class="calibre1">"Eh?"
<p class="calibre1">"Hurry up, it's urgent!
<p class="calibre1">"『Okay, okay!
<p class="calibre1">She borrowed the call of her former junior (Welf) and called out to the little human girl across from the crystal.
<p class="calibre1">Just as the atmosphere of panic came, a powerful magical power rose up from far behind  Tsubaki,  and  a  golden  pillar  of  light  that  looked  like  a  wooden  mallet appeared overhead.
<p class="calibre1">"Manabou Mallet!
<p class="calibre1">The level of sublimation gifted by the sorcerer was inhabited by himself, and his ability rose from Lv. 5 to Lv. 6.
<p class="calibre1">However, Tsubaki's sweat was still flowing uncontrollably.
<p class="calibre1">All  the  adventurers  around  him  feel  except  for  himself,  forming  a  fighting  arena stained with bright red blood.
<p class="calibre1">"The one who is qualified to fight me to the death is you, [One-Eyed Giant Master].
<p class="calibre1">"That's natural, you demon sword. Let me break your magic sword."
<p class="calibre1">Hogni's eyes were as sharp as the tip of a sword, staring intently at Tsubaki.
<p class="calibre1">It's not an elf, it's an evil spirit.
<p class="calibre1">She put such a smile on her light-hearted words, and immediately dispelled it again and set up the love sword "Red Time Rain".
<p class="calibre1">A gust of wind blew by, shaking the black elf's coat and making a sound.
<p class="calibre1">In the middle of the central force that was close to destruction, the Warlord and the Forger began to confront each other.
<p class="calibre1">"There is no change in the fix. --This sword is your tombstone."
<p class="calibre1">In an instant, the two figures disappeared and unleashed a fierce sword strike.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p151"></a>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Tsubaki!"
<p class="calibre1">Hearing the sound of swords striking violently from behind, Welf shouted.
<p class="calibre1">It  was  a  sword  dance  that  the  Lv.  2  Welf  couldn't  even  identify.  The  blackened sword clashed with the long blade and slid away, the flying sparks turned into trails, signaling that there had been a chopping blow here.
<p class="calibre1">The battle between the two Lv. 6's that gave rise to the stigmata caused Welf to draw a cold breath and then clench his fists.
<p class="calibre1">(Whether or not it is a single fight, must carry on the support! Lily mentioned the
<p class="calibre1">"magic" of [Black Demon Sword] to Ben! My magic (invisible ghost fire) will be very effective ......!)
<p class="calibre1">Lily shared all the information that Finn knew about [Freya's familia]. Among them, of course, was Hogni's 『Magic』.
<p class="calibre1">Personality change magic (Daine Slew) consumes mental energy all the time while maintaining『The strongest warlord (another Hogni)』and the body carries magic power. This is true for the demonic glint in the eyes and the deep purple glow like yang-yang that emanates from the body.
<p class="calibre1">And if there is 『magic power』 there, Welf's anti-magic magic can turn it into fire and start a flame.
<p class="calibre1">Like  empowering  magic,  the  personality  change  magic  that  had  to  be  activated continuously was a perfect target for Welf.
<p class="calibre1">"[Burn it all down, Karma of Foreign Law!
<p class="calibre1">Holding  the『Magic  Sword』in  his  left  hand,  he  extended  his  right  hand  on  the other side.
<p class="calibre1">He poured in his spiritual power and extended the range to the limit.
<p class="calibre1">In this way, even though he couldn't see his opponent quickly and accurately, he could cover the range of Hogni's movement.
<p class="calibre1">He aimed at the entire fighting arena that was still exchanging swords with Tsubaki and shouted out a super short text chant in one breath.
<p class="calibre1">"[Invisible Ghost--"
<p class="calibre1">However,
<p class="calibre1">Thud! There was a thud.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p152"></a>It was as if he had tapped the wheel with his long staff.
<p class="calibre1">It was like a light 'cat' kicking the ground and running at a fast pace.
<p class="calibre1">The instant before the anti-magic magic was activated, the sound of 'Instant Kick'
<p class="calibre1">sounded.
<p class="calibre1">In an instant.
<p class="calibre1">At Welf's right shoulder, pieces of flesh flew out.
<p class="calibre1">"--------"
<p class="calibre1">A  sharp  diagonal  line  swept  across  the  field  of  vision,  and  a  large  chunk  was gouged off the shoulder.
<p class="calibre1">The river of time gradually tightened up and the moment Welf realized that he was being attacked, blood erupted from the gouged out section and a scream erupted from his throat.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Welf's  eyes  filled  with  blood,  his  face  instantly  erupted  with  a  large  amount  of sweat, while his right arm wandered helplessly in the air like a broken doll.
<p class="calibre1">"Don't give me any shit here, you dirty bastard."
<p class="calibre1">The voice came from the right.
<p class="calibre1">Welf turned around and spotted him.
<p class="calibre1">"You, it's ......!"
<p class="calibre1">[Goddess Chariot], Allen Fromel.
<p class="calibre1">The  adventurer  who  had  easily  interrupted  Welf's  magic  was  standing  leisurely with a silver spear in his hand.
<p class="calibre1">The silver shoulder armor that rested on the left shoulder, from there extended the emerald green one-shoulder cloak. The defense was only that shoulder armor and the  silver  leg  armor  that  covered  below  the  knee.  The  equipment  that  he  never thought he would get shot at was the reason why he was "Urban Speediest".
<p class="calibre1">Welf, whose face was distorted by sweat and burning pain, didn't know.
<p class="calibre1">If [Goddess Chariot] was wearing a one-shoulder jacket, it was proof that he was going to face this fight with all his might.
<p class="calibre1">"I was going to finish you off in one hit just like before.
<p class="calibre1">"......!?"
<p class="calibre1">"You  pulled  back  a  split  second  before.  You  didn't  want  to  be  run  over  by  me anymore, did you?
<p class="calibre1">That's exactly what happened.
<p class="calibre1">In the Goddess Festival, Welf had also been attacked by Allen, and his body had subconsciously  moved  the  moment  he  caught  the  chilling  sound  of  the  "Instant Kick". This momentary defense instinct prevented him from killing him instantly.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p153"></a>"But, there was no point. It's a waste of time. Just disappear."
<p class="calibre1">"Are you kidding me!
<p class="calibre1">The way Allen looked at him was not even at the enemy, but at a 'step' in the way, which made Welf extremely angry.
<p class="calibre1">However, Welf shook off the burning pain and roared for just a moment, and Allen was close to his eyes in an instant.
<p class="calibre1">What began immediately was a fierce silver spear jab.
<p class="calibre1">"Kah, yeh, goo ah ah ah ah ah ah ......!
<p class="calibre1">The  roar  that  came  out  only  strengthened  his  voice.  His  right  arm  was  hanging down weakly, and it was unbelievable that it was still attached to his body, so all Welf  could  do  was  to  turn  his  body  sideways  and  use  the  magic  sword  he  was holding in his left hand, "Ekko-Huang Yue", as a shield to defend against the attack.
<p class="calibre1">This posture also looks like a comical child hiding behind a tree trunk, but unable to completely block the body. He covered his body with his longsword-type magic sword and endured the repeated blows from the tip of the gun like a mountain of swords.
<p class="calibre1">But it was still being chipped off. The waza-suit, the skin, the whole body.
<p class="calibre1">It was also gradually losing. Blood, grip strength, and the will to fight back.
<p class="calibre1">The left hand holding the magic sword, and the shoulder holding the spine of the sword,  were  both  screaming  from  the  impact  of  penetrating  the  defense.  The muscles collapsed, and even the bones cracked and broke, gradually destroying the  whole  body.  The  gun's  burst  that  can  only  be  described  as  an  angry  wave instantly forced Welf into a desperate situation.
<p class="calibre1">(...... folded constantly.)
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, Allen showed an astonished expression.
<p class="calibre1">Despite jabbing and shaking countless times, 『Welf's Magic Sword』 would not break.  The  usual  『Magic  Sword』  was  supposed  to  be  expendable,  but  this sword seemed to override it, showing his 『unyielding』 for the maker.
<p class="calibre1">The chariot's (Allen's) sharp gaze changed, and the 'steps' in front of him became a clear 'obstacle'.
<p class="calibre1">"What's with this 『Magic Sword』?"
<p class="calibre1">"...... It's me, who made ...... a 『magic sword』 in the district ......!
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Allen's question, Welf did not boast.
<p class="calibre1">With the reserve of a forger, he insisted that this work of meeting created in the labyrinth (dungeon) was only 'a necessary point for higher ground'.
<p class="calibre1">"You can't even break a mere 『Magic Sword』, so it seems that you are no better than that ......!
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p154"></a>Then, the bluff was maintained.
<p class="calibre1">He  forced  a  smile  to  appear  on  his  bruised  body,  which  was  bleeding uncontrollably.
<p class="calibre1">However,  this  kind  of  provocation  -  the  forger  snickered  at  the  first  level adventurer's  stance  in  an  unflattering  manner  -  did  not  displease  Allen,  whose expression was as it was just now.
<p class="calibre1">"I'm impressed by your forging skills."
<p class="calibre1">Instead, very calmly, for the first time, recognized Welf.
<p class="calibre1">"But that's all."
<p class="calibre1">"----"
<p class="calibre1">And with a murderous aura to stab Welf through.
<p class="calibre1">He kicked at the stone slab under his feet, triggering a high-speed acceleration.
<p class="calibre1">A forger naturally couldn't react.
<p class="calibre1">Welf turned into a 『Turtle』 with half of his body covered by a 『Magic Sword』, and he jumped to Welf's side in a flash and kicked out.
<p class="calibre1">"Kahhhhh!
<p class="calibre1">With that, the end came for Welf.
<p class="calibre1">The upward kick of the right foot caught the side of the stomach, and the sole of Welf's shoe left the ground.
<p class="calibre1">The  young  man's  body  was  surrounded  by  a  momentary  hovering  sensation, followed by another roundhouse kick from his left foot.
<p class="calibre1">Numerous cracks were born in the ribs, and the body was blown away and rolled down on top of the stone floor, falling down miserably.
<p class="calibre1">The "magic sword" that I said I would not let go of was bathed in blood and dyed crimson.
<p class="calibre1">I told you before, "I'm not a good person. Go hide in the workshop and play with iron.
<p class="calibre1">That was the day when the [Ishtar Familia] was destroyed.
<p class="calibre1">As when he first met Welf, Allen said with contempt.
<p class="calibre1">"What are you misunderstanding? How  can a mere defeated dog, a forger (you guys) be useful on the battlefield."
<p class="calibre1">What Welf did was to stop him for less than a minute.
<p class="calibre1">Allen dropped the Forger who was lying on the ground, silent, and started to fulfill his mission.
<p class="calibre1">「Yeh!
<p class="calibre1">Waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</p>
<p class="calibre1">!
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p155"></a>"Hit ...... can't hit ...... can't hit ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah ah!
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the 『Chariot』 that participated in the battle just like the War King (Hogni) as  instructed  by  the  commander  (Hedin),  the  adventurers  of  the  allied  forces sounded a despairing voice. The formation was torn apart so miserably that Lily, who  was  overlooking  the  battlefield  from  her  grave,  turned  blue  and  eventually became something meaningless.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">「Aisha-sama! The troops in the center were!"
<p class="calibre1">"Asshole ......! That group of first rank adventurers (monsters)!!!"
<p class="calibre1">Left flank.
<p class="calibre1">The rising sand and dust had just cleared, when Mikoto and Aisha saw the central troops being almost destroyed by Hogni and Allen, and let out a bitter shout at the same time.
<p class="calibre1">As with the mainstream configuration, the central unit was the strongest among the cross teams of the faction valve alliance. It was configured with Lv. 5 Tsubaki, and the greatest number of warriors such as adventurers and forgers were also allocated. However, the troops were on the verge of total annihilation.
<p class="calibre1">The adventurers were not even allowed to escape and were being crushed, a sight that was no longer considered a normal war.
<p class="calibre1">"What  to  do!  Sir  Lily  is  overwhelmed  just  by  commanding  the  central  and  right flanks! If this continues ......!"
<p class="calibre1">"...... to the center! If the [One-Eyed Giant Master] falls, it's really over! We'll get Haruhime and the others who are hiding and go support the dwarf..."
<p class="calibre1">Aisha made this decision after a long time of agony.
<p class="calibre1">Now that the left flank was also in a big melee, someone had to come behind and make sacrifices, otherwise they wouldn't even be able to cross the battlefield and reach the center. Aisha shook off her guilt and was about to open her mouth and say to the battle whores fighting around her, "You will die here.
<p class="calibre1">"Ungaah!?"
<p class="calibre1">"Kaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
<p class="calibre1">However, this decision also turned out to be a meaningless thing.
<p class="calibre1">"......!? Charlei, Eliza!"
<p class="calibre1">The battle whore located in the dead center, 『Four people』 were knocked down at the same time.
<p class="calibre1">Aisha turned her head back together with the stunned fate, and what was reflected in her eyes were four black shadows.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p156"></a>"A useless plan."
<p class="calibre1">"How could it be possible?"
<p class="calibre1">How can it be done?" "How can you say that?
<p class="calibre1">"After all, we are here."
<p class="calibre1">Sand-colored helmets, and armor of the same color.
<p class="calibre1">Lance,  sledgehammer,  great  ax,  great  sword,  quadruplets  with  four  weapons appeared in front of the left flank troops.
<p class="calibre1">"The Four Gulliver Brothers ......! [Inferno Gold Four Warriors]!!!"
<p class="calibre1">Faced  with  the  warrior's  life,  the  three  brothers'  lips  crooked  into  a  shape  of mockery.
<p class="calibre1">"「[Absolute †Shadow] and [Lije].
<p class="calibre1">"A reenactment of the Goddess Festival."
<p class="calibre1">"It's going to be defeated by us again."
<p class="calibre1">Finally, the eldest male Alfrigg said with sympathy.
<p class="calibre1">"For the sake of Freya-sama, you will fall here."
<p class="calibre1">"Don't look down on people! Don't look down on people!"
<p class="calibre1">After the furious Aisha, the Amazons covered in blood also roared.
<p class="calibre1">The  flames  of  the  『Magic  Sword』,  the  light  of  rank  sublimation,  and  the fluctuation of gravity were all infused into it, and began to resist the strong warriors led by the quadruplets with all their might.
<p class="calibre1">After the disadvantage, it was still a disadvantage.
<p class="calibre1">The "mirror" floating above the main street reflected the battle, perhaps the people, the adventurers, or perhaps the gods looked up in awe and said so. Or perhaps, all of them murmured.
<p class="calibre1">This is just a ravaging (one-sided game).
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"The idiot (Hogni), who is also the strongest in white combat among the fellow elfs, is in the center, using the stupid cat, which has good mobility, to crush the magic sword unit, and the left flank, which is less damaged, is blocking with the prum's chain ...... Such a standard response is not the least bit interesting.
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p157"></a>The first thing you need to do is to look at the battle from the roof of the temple on your side of the camp, and say it in a bored way.
<p class="calibre1">Even if you don't keep the first level adventurers first, once the battle begins, they will be put into the battlefield, the final scene should be similar to the current one.
<p class="calibre1">However, Hedin wants to be foolproof.
<p class="calibre1">As  a  military  advisor,  he  knew  very  well  how  deadly  the  word  "first-class adventurers' fall" was. If Hogni or Allen and the others fall, even the tough warriors who are not afraid of death will be shaken, causing morale to fall to the bottom.
<p class="calibre1">The enemy commander (Lili) must have also aimed at this point.
<p class="calibre1">Therefore,  to  first  reach  the  present  state  where  the  only  unsettling  factor  of
<p class="calibre1">"Clouzot's  magic  sword"  was  completely  excluded,  and  then  use  the  greatest weapon of the first level adventurer. The coldness was enough to make Lily and Daphne despair.
<p class="calibre1">"Most of the faction valve alliance's main battle force was forced out ...... but, there was one less 『Rabbit』 ah.
<p class="calibre1">The elf's eyes did not spare every detail of the enemy's formation.
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of such a large-scale melee, he still clearly saw that the white-haired boy who had been coached by himself had not shown up so far.
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that there is only one more Lv. 5 can't be a step back to life.
<p class="calibre1">The stupid rabbit that was killed so many times in the "Battle Wilderness" should have understood this firsthand, Hedin muttered.
<p class="calibre1">"What's more ...... from the point of view of the victory conditions (rules) of this war game, he can't do it either."
<p class="calibre1">How  about  the  fact  that  the  faction-valve  allied  forces  can  only  use  this  main battlefield as 'bait' and the queen (queen) as the real target if they want to win.
<p class="calibre1">The white elf even predicted the thinking of the allied side like a demon, and then raised his head.
<p class="calibre1">His narrowed eyes gazed at the sides of the island away from the main battlefield.
<p class="calibre1">"Southwest ...... or northwest?"
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p158"></a>
<p class="calibre1">I am running on the northwest side.
<p class="calibre1">Hiding from everyone, staying cautious while at top speed.
<p class="calibre1">Just one person, running towards the base camp of [Freya's familia].
<p class="calibre1">"「Lily, I'd better go and fight with everyone ......!
<p class="calibre1">"No! Bell-sama, please go to Freya-sama now!
<p class="calibre1">The battlefield roar that hit my left shoulder and behind me from time to time  - I didn't need to confirm that it was the miserable cry of my companion - almost made me turn back, but Lily's voice from the eye crystal didn't allow me to do so.
<p class="calibre1">As soon as "Clouzot's Magic Sword" spewed flames and the battle began, I went around the northwest of the island, preparing to make a wide circle to the rear of the  "main  battlefield"  where  the  allied  forces  of  the  Ekphrasis  and  the  [Freya Familia] clashed.
<p class="calibre1">This was Lili's instruction. She wanted to use the army-sized battle as a decoy to get closer to the enemy's main camp.
<p class="calibre1">"There are [White Demon Wand] and [Fierce One] in the enemy line!
<p class="calibre1">"......!"
<p class="calibre1">"『Without defeating the strongest adventurer in the city, there is no way to win!
<p class="calibre1">Lily was right. The so-called 『Top Spot』 was such an existence.
<p class="calibre1">At the Goddess Festival, I was subdued by that powerful arm with just one blow, so I could feel this thing more painfully.
<p class="calibre1">As long as that [Fierce One] is still standing before the throne, guarding the master, the coalition of faction warlords will be defeated.
<p class="calibre1">If we don't try to solve the strongest Lv.7 in the city, we will have no future!
<p class="calibre1">"『And to say what can defeat the [Fierce One], it is only Lord Bell's [Heroic Wish (Skill)]!
<p class="calibre1">I glanced at the eye crystal that was mounted on my left arm armor just like at the time  of  the  Maze  Street  attack  and  defense  battle,  and  then  looked  at  my  right hand.  I  looked  at  the  light  that  was  ringing  the  Bell  and  had  begun  to  build  up power.
<p class="calibre1">In the "Hakodate" that was distorted by "Charm", I was living in the [Freya Familia], so my information (ability value) was leaked to Master and the others. After seeing the enemy shadow in the launch [hero wish] must be too late. There is no way that the strong warriors will allow this to happen.
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, we have to start now. To make the most powerful attack, you can only start building up your strength before you meet the enemy.
<p class="calibre1">The mission I was given was "Strong Attack".
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p159"></a>I  will  continue  to  sneak  and  move,  and  deliver  the  most  powerful  blow  to  the enemy's strongest opponent, Mr. Ottar.
<p class="calibre1">If the wave attack of  『Crozzo's Magic Sword』 hit a blank, there was only this method left to defeat 【Fierce One】, that was the conclusion Lily came to at that time.
<p class="calibre1">"She had to sacrifice everyone except herself, and she had to reach Freya-sama even if she was the only one! If we don't do that, we can't win this battle!
<p class="calibre1">Even if she was cut down by Hogni-san, even if she was crushed by Allen-san, even  if  she  was  destroyed  by  Alfrigg-san  and  the  others,  even  if  she  was  shot through by Master, even if she had to ignore Haide-sama and the others, she had to crush Ottar-san and reach Freya-sama - to reach that person's side.
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Lily tell in the body of the commander, I clenched my teeth.
<p class="calibre1">I had to do that, even the Bell that rang made me realize that.
<p class="calibre1">I  waved  away  my  heartbreaking  feelings  and  continued  to  approach  the  enemy line.
<p class="calibre1">(Cautiously, quickly! We must not be detected!)
<p class="calibre1">The building that was about to crumble, the marble avenue, the huge columned promenade without a ceiling. I took advantage of the landscape that is worthy of an urban ruin, hid in the shadows, and after confirming that there was no enemy scent or line of sight, I quickly ran to the next location.
<p class="calibre1">I was now in a 'transparent state'.
<p class="calibre1">My body was cloaked in Ferros-san's "Reverse Spirit Veil", and my posture was hidden.
<p class="calibre1">Even so, I couldn't approach it boldly.
<p class="calibre1">The other party is Master and his familia [Freya's familia]. Even if they felt a little bit of dissonance, it was over. Even if I even used a deodorant bag to hide from the orcs' noses and did such a thorough job, I couldn't be completely at ease.
<p class="calibre1">What's more, the
<p class="calibre1">(The  sound  of  storing  power  ......!  Although  it  should  not  be  able  to  reach  the opponent's position, those close to it will definitely be exposed!) The  sound  of  the  Bell  that  kept  contracting  and  stretching  along  with  the  white particles of light made me sweat coldly.
<p class="calibre1">A scout, even if he can perfectly conceal his own scent, if he makes a sound, then he is reduced to a foolish person who reveals his position to the enemy. And I had to maintain this foolish secrecy to launch a strong attack. Although I had to build up  firepower  that  could  defeat  the  enemy,  the  contradiction  between  this  and
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p160"></a>stealthiness  was  not  helped  by  the  fact  that  it  made  the  heartbeat  sound  even louder.
<p class="calibre1">(Never trigger the sound of the boundary lifting ...... big Bell tower ......!) If  a  huge  Bell  booms,  then  no  matter  how  far  away  it  is,  the  opponent  will immediately be aware of it.
<p class="calibre1">If the enemy is met by a tough warrior before he invades, he will lose this once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.
<p class="calibre1">The only way to get close to the limit is to use the usual power storage.
<p class="calibre1">(But ...... Can I really hide it from the Master's eyes?) The side of Master's face flashed in his mind countless times, and now he should be far ahead, watching without carelessness from the enemy line.
<p class="calibre1">That man was powerful. And a mind smarter than anyone else's.
<p class="calibre1">Would he know exactly what we were up to?
<p class="calibre1">I fought off the terrible suspicion, suppressed my trembling breath, and marched forward as fast as I could reach.
<p class="calibre1">"...... here is ......"
<p class="calibre1">Then I arrived at an extraordinarily large structure.
<p class="calibre1">It was once the 『Amphitheater』.
<p class="calibre1">A part of the outer wall crumbled down, and from there, the interior of the mantle-shaped  auditorium  and  stage  were  revealed.  The  stage  was  about  150M  in diameter, and the auditorium, which included the outer wall, was 30M high, so it is easy to imagine that many people came to this amphitheater to watch plays on this island, which lacked entertainment in the ancient times.
<p class="calibre1">After  falling  to  the  ground,  the  faded  pillars  evoked  a  faint  sadness,  and  I immediately averted my eyes.
<p class="calibre1">There was no time for sentimentality now. I was about to walk around the theater and pass through.
<p class="calibre1">And just then.
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!
<p class="calibre1">"A black shadow swept across the ground.
<p class="calibre1">A black shadow swept across the ground, and a murderous aura descended from overhead.
<p class="calibre1">The moment before the released roar and the sword blade was about to strike my body, I raised my dagger in a panic.



<p class="calibre1">"Goo!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The attacker's twin swords collided with The Dagger of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wasn't able to block it completely. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p161"></a>Although I managed to avoid direct damage, the "Reverse Spirit Veil" on my body was torn away and the "Transparent State" was forcibly lifted. After floating in the air from the impact, I received an additional kick. I was easily kicked away because I couldn't move my right hand freely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  flew  backwards,  taking  half  of  the  force  off  myself,  but  I  still  ended  up  in  the Amphitheater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  tumbled  between  the  walls  of  the  amphitheater,  and  was  forced  to  the  stage where there was no way to escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You thought you wouldn't be exposed by the sound of that Bell! Bell!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......! Mr. Van!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Van-san, the tough half-human warrior who chased me and landed steadily on the wide stage, pointed out my problem as he did before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Caught on ......!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">A strong attack was thwarted. Combat failed. End of story. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Is Mr. Van the only enemy? Where are the other members of the group? Can the situation be redeemed? What should I do next! </p>
<p class="calibre1">My heart was instantly consumed by anxiety at having my covert actions seen, and I'm afraid that Mr. Van, observing my expression, shouted in displeasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm the only one! It has nothing to do with Hedin-sama's instructions or anything like that! You fought so many times in the 'Battle Wilderness', so I guessed you would come here! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Then, of course, I was the one who sent you on your way! </p>
<p class="calibre1">He saw through my actions - no, he was lurking here in the northwest by himself, waiting for me to come! </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if looking at a traitor, Mr. Van stared at me who was dumbfounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're a traitor who was blessed by Freya-sama but rejected the divine will! No matter what Lord Ottar and the others say about me afterwards, I will finish you off with my own hands! </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was his true anger, persistence, and 'closure'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is my duty to take care of you! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it happened in a distorted world, we lived in the same base and ate from the same cauldron. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We killed each  other several times in  『Baptism』, and  occasionally got advice that made me feel an incredible bond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it was only false, I was indeed a companion (Freya familia) as much as they were during those approximately twenty days. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p162"></a>The eyes of the half-small human who was staring at me closely were distorted in pain. My eyes also changed into a painful shape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a flash, Van-san slashed over as if to shake off those worthless moods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Gu--!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Come on, Bell! Come and fight!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Van's weapon, the silver twin swords, threatened my life several times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you don't hold the hand extended from this side, then you will be buried. The two swords powerfully expressed this realization of his. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The twin swords that were about to be thrust into my chest were flicked away by me with The Dagger of God. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I could not refuse. In the amphitheater, like a reenactment of the  "baptism", the blades of Mr. Van and I met. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dagger and the two swords clashed together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sparks flew everywhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A high-pitched metallic sound, like a painful sorrowful cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My attacks lost their aim. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Entanglement led to one misjudgment after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It seems that my feelings for Van-san - for the [Freya Familia] - are much deeper than I thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"With only one hand, are you kidding me! Since when are you so amazing that you can look down on me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Use that stamina! Aim at me!!! Your enemy now is me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The red-colored shout hit my cheeks several times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing that I was still retaining my power, Mr. Van was furious and came over with a real fight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  feeling  in  my  heart  that  was  overwhelmed  by  his  power  was  not  terror  or anxiety, but a breathless "emptiness" and a "sadness" that wanted to shout out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sublimation is really very cruel. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The movement of the Lv. 4 Van who had fought several times among countless </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Baptisms』, sometimes winning and sometimes losing to him, was so slow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His attack was clearly visible. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the confusion in my mind, I was able to block Mr. Van's double strike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  order  to  fill  the  『deviation』  between  the  physical  body  and  the  spirit  after ascension, I had fought with the first level adventurers (Tiona-san) to my heart's content. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no reason that one would lose. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p163"></a>"---!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I stepped out with my teeth clenched to the limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And then it was over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I rushed into the arms of Mr. Van, whose eyes were wide open, sheathed my sword and made a fist with my left hand and punched out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Kah!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to burn out all the sorrow and sentimentality, I shouted out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Flame Volt]! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The left fist that hit my abdomen emitted a gunshot sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  blast  of  inflammatory  lightning  burned  Mr.  Van's  body  and  blew  him  away, causing his body to draw a gentle parabola and zap into a corner of the audience. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ bei, er ............!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Smashed to the ground, the semi-minor human peeled his back off the stone steps and fell forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Van, whose lips were stained with blood, stretched his trembling right hand this way and then simply lost consciousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't even mess up my breathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The battle, which lasted less than a minute. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lv. 5 and Lv. 4. The two numbers say it all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this bitter way, I realized how high I had climbed to the peak of the "first level adventurer". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Here it is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">But... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It took less than a minute, but it was enough to call the "strongest" to this place. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Dictatorship, Van. But, it saves me from searching." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sound of something coming into the arena. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the sound of someone's heavy breathing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Holding my breath, I slowly turned my head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Rust-colored hair and eyes, and a huge, overwhelming body like a boulder. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both hands were holding two large swords, and on his back was an even larger one, which should be called Black Block. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The faint voice fell from my lips as I faced the pig man who was facing the 『Top of the line』 of the King's Landing adventurers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「............ Ottar-san. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p164"></a>『The strongest in the city』 didn't go to the battle in the main battlefield ...... but was looking for me from the beginning? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The maximum accumulation of power is still a long way off. In the end, now that he has been discovered, the surprise strong attack has long since ceased to be valid. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The body that was frozen in place like an ice sculpture gradually lost its body heat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deep in the crystal, Lily's frozen breath also came through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, it was a real failure of plan, a combat error, and the only chance to win was lost. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The words 'the end of the road' filled our minds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Without saying a word, Mr. Ottar scanned my eyes as I stood in the center of the amphitheater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  narrowed  his  eyes  slightly  when  he  saw  the  particle  of  light  that  had  been collected in his right hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, threw it out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Throwing a large sword in his right hand, he threw it in front of my eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">With a thud, the large sword was inserted in a position that I could reach with my hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn't help but take a closer look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  material  was  refined  metal  (secret  silver).  The  sharpness  and  strength contained in it are genuine, and it is a first-rate weapon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is not an attack, not even an intimidation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was confused by the wonderful act of throwing a weapon at me, and could not move, and then Mr. Ottar said, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Take it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... eh?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I said take it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Take the big sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My eyes widened as I heard the short words spoken to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Use your full strength." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fierce man said so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Attack with all your might." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The words were spoken with the authority of a king. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'll take one of your moves." </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if to test me. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p165"></a>Or rather, as if to see me clearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bet everything you have and attack me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Take the full force of Bell Cranel," he said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbfounded. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seriously. He was seriously saying so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pigman in front of us already knew what we were trying to do, but he was still saying, "Let's do it"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Trap, no way ......! (There is no need to open a trap!) The true face of the opponent is "strongest". He was able to sink me into the earth just by coming at me from the front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  is  no  point  in  strategy  when  facing  a  low-level  adventurer  who  can  be slaughtered in an instant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, this is the style of the [Fierce One]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As the strongest dependents of the beautiful gods (gods), they want to test me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Bei, Bell-sama ......』 </p>
<p class="calibre1">A trembling voice came from the eye crystal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lilly was also shaken. But she was still talking to me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She told me that this was the best opportunity of a lifetime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">We must not let go. Although this is a handout given by the enemy, they can not help but dart over and take it into their arms. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If I miss this opportunity, I will be easily defeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the  contrary,  if  I  could  defeat  Ottar-san  here,  the  road  to  victory  would  be widened a lot in one breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I took it up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With my own right hand, I picked up the large silver sword that was stuck in front of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Flame Volt]!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  with  my  left  hand,  I  released  Inferno  Thunder  and  struck  it  into  the  sword made of refined metal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the next instant, the white particles of light that had accumulated only in the right hand were spread over the greatsword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  flames  that  should  have  spread  were  retained  by  the  silver  block,  greedily augmenting the power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Double reining. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As well as the change and expansion of the accumulation range. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p166"></a>The range was expanded from the right hand, where the power was first stored, to above  the  greatsword,  and  a  corresponding  strain  was  immediately  transmitted from the physical and mental strength, but now there was nothing to be done about it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tone did not change from a clock to a large clock tower. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was impossible for me to use Boundary Release with any more determination now that the matter had come to a head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This meant that I would have to stop the power buildup I was doing and then build up my power again,  and the  physical  and mental power I had expended  before stopping  would  just  disappear.  After  defeating  Ottar-san,  I  still  had  to  fight  the Tough Warriors, so I couldn't consume any more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I  gripped  the  hilt  of  my  sword  with  both  hands  and  quickly  carried  out  the accumulation  of  power,  less  than  a  minute  from  the  maximum  accumulation  of power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(............ really, to fight through? Although the opponent is not something that can be defeated by ordinary methods, will this maximum stored power after the [Heroic Wish] ......!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">The destructive power of [Hero Wish], naturally, is my own best understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Short time accumulation of power aside, the chopping power raised to the limit, no matter what kind of enemy, was completely destroyed. By relying on this 『skill』, Bell Cranel has turned the difference in rank upside down several times. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lord God had said. It was the power of reversal, a 『Hero's Strike』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This 『great strike』 is going to be hit by me on a living adventurer ......? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I looked at the pig man standing in front of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The defensive gear on him, surprisingly, was light clothing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Left chest, hand armor, forehead protector, etc. at first glance are very heavy, but it's only protecting a limited number of parts. With that kind of defense, will he easily lose to the maximum stored power decapitation and have his life taken away from me? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The enemy is the strongest adventurer in the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You must not be careless, you must not hold back, and you must not even make foolish speculations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even so... </p>
<p class="calibre1">The hesitation that rose in my heart caused me to hesitate, and I didn't know if I should use my full strength to strike. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But, as if to dispel my worries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Ottar began to chant. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p167"></a>"Silver Moon's Mercy, Gold's Wilderness. I hereby accept the command, and this body is the fierce pig of war (king)]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The chant that resonated around me made my eyes glare to the limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Carrying the divine will of the goddess, go forward...]" </p>
<p class="calibre1">A short chant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  the  incantation  was  completed  in  just  a  few  moments,  he  released  a fierce magic power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hildis Vini" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The light like the color of dusk was gathered on [Fierce]'s sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The glow first made me squint my eyes, and then I drew a cold breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The weapon took on a glow and turned into『Sword of Gold』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A fierce magic light covered the surface of the great sword, even like the flame of the  end.  The  glow  was  so  dazzling  that  it  gave  the  illusion  that  the  blade  was swollen, and one might even think that the weapon was covered with the fur of a giant golden boar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The magic power is so high that it is extraordinary ...... Does it mean that it is the same as [Heroic Wish]? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No - this is pure 『Super Enhancement』! </p>
<p class="calibre1">『That's what Finn-sama said, Ottar-sama's magic ......? It is said to have broken the golden glow of the adventurer who is also Lv. 7 ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  the  dazzling  golden  glow,  Lily  fell  in  the  depths  of  the  crystal  with  a trembling murmur. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Not caring about the opponent's stored power『Power increase』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  was  a  bit  vague,  but  after  combining  it  with  the  information  I  heard  from  Lily beforehand, I guessed so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's purely a power enhancement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And because it was so simple, once it was combined with Mr. Ottar who had an unusually strong "power", it became a "sure kill" beyond imagination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling  the  cold  sweat  dripping  down  my  skin,  I  completely  abandoned  my hesitation at this point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The power contained in the "Golden Sword" was so unconventional that it made me make this decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As I built up my strength, I slowly took my stance like a crossbow with the bowstring gradually tightened. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p168"></a>I gripped the hilt of my sword with both hands and stood sideways with my body sunk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like looking in the mirror, Mr. Ottar also took the same stance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the two swords given by the opponent, the paired greatsword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The weapons were in the same condition. There was no superiority or inferiority. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the winner would be the pure destructive power that combined arm strength and magic power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">White light and golden light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The whispering flame and the brave light. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  power  leaking  from  the  sword  formed  fluctuations  that  flooded  around  and filled the amphitheater. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily watched nervously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  longing  (Ais-sama)  in  the  metropolis  must  also  be  watching  through  the</p>
<p class="calibre1">『mirror』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I could clearly feel all the people who were not fighting on the battlefield casting their eyes toward us, clutching the hilt of their thick swords. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, "that moment" came. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Five minutes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The power reserve time, which had been extended after reaching Lv. 5, passed, and the Bell that wouldn't stop ringing reached its limit. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">I ran. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I used all my strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I put the great sword with the sacred fire on my right shoulder and darted towards the "strongest" in front of me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar-san didn't move. He was so motionless that it was frightening. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He turned into a veritable giant rock and watched my assault from the front. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Shaken, terrified, trembling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I shook them all off, let out a roar of flame, and unleashed a "Strike of Holy Fire". </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sacred Fire Slash! </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">With all my heart and strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell  Cranium,  who  had  climbed  to  Lv.5,  unleashed  what  was  undoubtedly  the strongest blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the face of this sure kill, the pigman who had his greatsword up roared out. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p169"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">He roared as if he was going to push me back with his voice alone, and unleashed an incredible "strange power". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Strike of Gold" swung down and collided with the "Strike of Holy Fire". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--------- -----!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a huge impact, a flash, and a boom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The antagonism lasted for only a few moments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  when  I  thought  that  the  blazing  holy  fire  suppressed  the  golden  fur  (glow), each other's great swords came to their limits almost simultaneously, shattering all above the hilt and blowing me and Mr. Ottar to the direct rear. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Karma! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I swept across the huge stage with the momentum of a dike, and my back slammed into the marble wall. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stone wall became shattered from where my back slammed into it, and my lungs forced the air out, and the amphitheater literally shook with a wailing sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cracks were born in the walls and the audience, and the stone slabs raised sand and dust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I don't know if it was an illusion or not, but all the sounds disappeared throughout the urban ruins (island). </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was almost as if the adventurers and tough warriors had stopped moving and held their breath because of the clash of our blows. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Cough, cough ...... ah ah ah ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only  the  hilt  of  the  sword  fell  from  my  hand,  and  the  repercussions  of  the  blow struck my whole body, tormenting me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The impact caused both my hands to twitch uncontrollably, and at that moment I raised my head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Deep in the sand and dust. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ahead of the fading smoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I breathed shakily and stared there half-praying ...... Then the 『black shadow』 </p>
<p class="calibre1">appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... The two cancel each other out, ah." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A low, short voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The man stood there. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p170"></a>The  overly  thick  feet  pulled  two  lines  on  the  stone-paved  stage,  and  he  still maintained the posture of slamming into the wall behind him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Ottar peeled his huge back off the crumbling stone wall and slowly looked over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No ...... considering the rank, it's your one hit that's stronger than mine." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pure praise. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rust colored eyes narrowed and praised the holy fire English cut that canceled out with the enemy's magic (Hildis Vini). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Despite the praise, my face was tinged with a pale color. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cancel? Neutralize? [Hero's Wish]? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one that won against that Destroyer's (Juggernaut’s) broken claws, the "Holy Fire Eizen"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That was a good hit ...... but." </p>
<p class="calibre1">With  my  full  strength,  I  failed  to  seize  this  initial  and  final  good  opportunity  to successfully crush [Fierce One]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The body that was scorched by the holy fire spit out black smoke, but InuYasha Musume came forward leisurely, not feeling the slightest damage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It was only one blow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He threw away the hilt of the great sword that had turned into a miserable wreck, and pulled out the incredible "black great sword" from his back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The crystal embedded in the hand armor was shouting something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It must have been saying to run away, faster. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, I, who was firmly controlled by Warrior's body, had understood one thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As long as you turn your back to him, you will be killed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Escape was not allowed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only here, fighting with that 'strongest' until the end of my life. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"From now on - it's just a simple struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  dawned  on  me  that  this  amphitheater  had  turned  into  a  hunting  ground  for ruthless boars. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">The slash flashed instantly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The silver blade flash and the pitch-black sword light met fiercely. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p171"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who roared like a wild animal was Tsubaki. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everything that was called clothing had been cut up, and only the upper half of her body was left with a breast wrap, but the half-dwarf woman still roared out. With her long sword held in both hands, she bounced off the fierce sword strikes and hit back again and again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one-eyed forger who was transformed into a shura was confronted by Hogni. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  neither  fear  nor  disdain  in  the  gaze  of  the  black  elf  whose  coat  had become  torn  and  tattered.  He  regarded  the  female,  who  was  covered  with sublimated golden light and vowed to cut down himself, as a strong enemy, and himself, with the might of a warlord, fought squarely with his sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Silver and pitch black, gold and deep purple. The trails of light from weapons and magic intersected and drew a trajectory. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  two  were  engaged  in  an  interdimensional  battle  that  left  even  the  tough warriors and adventurers in the battlefield speechless, and the struggle became more and more intense. Then. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The final blow was swung. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He threw away the sheath and threw out the right sura chop with all his strength. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the other hand, he threw out a high speed upward slash as if his sword was about to meet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tsubaki and Hogni, who had swung their swords and knives, exchanged positions and remained in a heartbreaking position for several moments. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who spurted blood from his shoulder was Hogni. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He squinted his eyes at his left shoulder that was split open, and the wind of the battlefield blew his jacket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo, ah" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who noticed his defeat was Tsubaki. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The upward slash that flashed diagonally caused her body to spit out blood, and her body fell towards the ground as the chest wrap was cut off. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The long black hair tied into a bundle also broke free and spread out in a fan shape, while at the same time the light of the rank ascension dissipated, as if to announce that the time limit had expired. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... You should feel honored, [One-eyed Giant Master]. Your blow threatened this life." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p172"></a>Hogni said as he held his sword in his right hand and turned back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tsubaki, who had fallen sideways to the ground, also simply turned his right eye, which was not wearing an eye patch, and looked back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But,  this  "Suffering  Abyss"  is  the  "Avant-Garde  Killer"  ......  your  end  will  be  the same as other swordsmen, the bait for the Devil's Sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hagney's beloved sword, the first class armed "Afflicted Abyss". </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's also a cursed weapon that a spellcaster was involved in making, and the ability that was revealed after paying the price was - "Expanded decapitation range". </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the battle against people, the more excellent vision swordsmen can disrupt their sense of distance, and in the battle against the army can slash many enemies at once, is  a  pure killing attribute. If Hogni,  who  has the top white-knuckle  combat ability  among  the  first  level  adventurers,  wields  this  sword,  he  will  become  the sword emperor of the devil, whether in individual or organizational warfare, all of which is his domain of domination. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You, guy ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Tsubaki, who had cultivated countless weapons, was unable to see through the sword path of the pitch-black spell sword (Suffering Abyss), which cut through her brown skin time and again, leaving several wounds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even with a huge rise in ability value through foul moves (rank ascension), it still failed to surpass Hogni's sword. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That's why I said ............ don't want to be your opponent ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm sorry, Lord god-sama - Vergil. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment before  closing her eyes, she whispered her apologies to the  Lord, and the youth who had fallen to the ground long ago. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fact that the strongest fighting force of the faction's allied army, the  highest ranked  forger  of  Lv.  5,  had  fallen,  the  matter  caused  a  drastic  change  in  the situation all of a sudden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[One-eyed Giant Master] ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing Tsubaki's defeated stance, Daphne's face lost all its blood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The morale of the faction valve alliance army was already at a great disadvantage, and now it had hit the bottom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The fall of Tsubaki, the first level adventurer class warrior who was guarding the central unit, had such significance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, what should we do? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's nothing left of the [Magic Sword] either! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The [Goddess Chariot] took all the forgers ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p173"></a>Bors, Ouka, and Chigusa who acted collectively as a squad let out a cry of sorrow one after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As they said, Allen ran around freely and hunted off the people with  『Crozzo's magic sword』 as a priority. Right flank, center, left flank, wherever these people were  configured.  He  used  his  high-speed  foot  power  to  ignore  the  distance between  them,  and  buried  the  remaining  [Hephaestus  Familia]  forgers  and  the adventurers of the Inn Street into the earth in turn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even Daphne, who was the deputy commander, couldn't even think of a course, let alone try to open up the situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a situation where they were forced to stop thinking, the "War King" appeared in front of them mercilessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The next sacrifice is you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......! [Black Demon Sword]!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">After cutting down Tsubaki, Hogni set Daphne and the girls as the next target. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  girls,  who  were  barely  maintaining  their  squad  form,  were  identified  as  the biggest threat at the moment - but it was only an element of unease comparable to that of ants, so Hogni simply came to this right flank of the battlefield seriously, even somewhat recklessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Little, little Daphne ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Cassandra, who was standing in the center of the group, turned pale as if a patient felt her own death. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daphne  reflexively  stood  in  front  of  her  of  the  healer,  protecting  her,  and  then remembered as if it were no longer a matter of concern: there was no point in doing so now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  blood  and  sweat  mingled  together  and  became  heavy  and  sticky,  dripping down the young girl's cheeks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hey, hey! What should I do, [Laurel Vanisher]? What should I do? Say something! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bors, who understood the 『despair』 of confronting a first rank adventurer on the battlefield more profoundly than anyone else present, shouted loudly and was on the verge of falling into panic. He didn't immediately pull out his legs and run away because, like Daphne, he knew it was pointless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Daphne-sama ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"[Laurel Vanisher]!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Chigusa, who was holding a bow and arrow, and Ouka, who was standing at the front  of  the  group,  clutching  her  battle  ax  "Royal  Kong",  were  waiting  for  the commander to make a decision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(Don't be like this. I'm not such a great commander (person)-) </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p174"></a>The sound of a heartbeat took over Daphne's mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(I can't think of a move to bring back the dead like a brave man-!) The urge to give up all responsibility dominated Daphne's heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(--But, Liliruca she.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">And Daphne's will. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At  the  end,  recalling  the  side  of  a  certain  young  girl's  face,  she  dismissed  the thoughts she had just had. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(No matter how bad the situation was, she didn't run away from it. ......) The  scene  she  recalled  was  from  the  "Expedition".  The  strengthened  species (moss giant), the floor lord (Amphisbaena), the cruelty that came one after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the midst of this despair, Lily's small body trembled, but kept fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daphne pretended to be a 『Master』, the young girl who was cultivated, definitely would not escape. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(...... that's not just going to do it.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's so annoying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daphne inwardly spit out such words, while the eyes have renewed power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time for the girl as long as forever, but for the world, but only a few moments of entanglement. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But Horne found that in just a few moments, Daphne, just as he had expected, had regained her "threatening" flavor, so he narrowed his eyes sharply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"To struggle. That's not bad. Then, from now on, I will consider you as 'enemies'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Carefully, solemnly, and without fail ...... will hunt you all." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The war king will not be careless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how low the opponent's personality, the lacquered black magic sword still cut off all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Daphne frowned and stared at the black elf who had nothing to take advantage of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  black  sword  that  was  raised,  the  black  coat  that  was  shaking,  the  "Self-alteration Magic" that was completely activated... </p>
<p class="calibre1">The last thing the commander (Daphne), who had observed everything about the enemy and absorbed all kinds of information, stared at ...... was the tip of the sword that was still pointing at them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She closed her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Gently gripped the blue crystal hanging at her waist, as if entrusting everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Everyone, listen to me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally Daphne opened her eyes, and like a tyrant, gave the 『worst order of all』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let him cut." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p175"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"Goo-!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「Aisha-sama!!! </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the violent sound of the sword and halberd, the moan of the shrew (Amazon) and the maiden's (human) cry of sorrow came out at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's over." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In Aisha's field of vision, the sledgehammer and the great ax approached as if to crush the field of vision. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was a sure kill combination of the second and third male of the four Gulliver brothers, Duvalin and Berling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Neither defense nor evasion, the way back has been blocked. They swung their weapons in unison from the left front and the right front, and were about to destroy Aisha mercilessly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"However, it was going to be stopped again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The moment before that, the voices of the eldest male Alfrigg and the fourth male Grer sounded out in boredom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was almost like having four visions, Duvalin and Berling who were going to tackle Aisha stepped backwards. </p>
<p class="calibre1">An instant later, a violent 『lightning strike』 exploded at the spot where the four brothers once stood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sir Naza ......! Thank you very much!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If it wasn't for that guy, I don't know how many times I would have died! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  one  that  was  shot  out  and  stuck  in  the  center  of  the  large  crater  that  was formed was a thin sword type 『Crozzo's magic sword』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mikoto, who was cheering, instantly pounced on the thin sword type "Magic Sword" </p>
<p class="calibre1">that was stuck there and swung it horizontally at the four Gulliver brothers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I didn't get rid of it again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How many times have I done that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Eleventh time." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"All the other adventurers were cleaned up without any problems, but [Rijay] and </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Jedi] are very tough. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p176"></a>Each of the four brothers said something like they were complaining, while calmly dodging the huge power of the Magic Sword, the only ho-rai that could sink them, with ease. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The western part of the urban ruins, southeast side of the 『Main Battlefield』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  left  flank  of  the  allied  forces  of  the  Pai  Warlords  was  still  not  completely destroyed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The troops endured the onslaught of the strong warriors led by the [Inferno Gold Four Warriors], and their performance was enough to make the gods watching the battle in the metropolis praise it as a struggle without exaggeration. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was all because there was a cautious and more timid than anyone else 『Bow Soldier』 among them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Almost over the top ......! With my skills, there's no way I can shoot it!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Behind Aisha and the girls, Naza occupied the top of the colonnade, which was arranged in a staircase, about 100M long, and she let out a voice like a sorrowful cry, while setting up a new arrow, the 『Magic Sword』, on her longbow from her quiver on her back. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A long-range shot using "Krozo's Magic Sword". </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the sniping that the first level adventurer was able to restrain that continued the lives of Aisha, the girls, and the left flank. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sniping  the  opponent  while  resupplying  the  "Magic  Sword"  for  my  companions (here) ......! I didn't know there was such a tactic! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I didn't know there was such a tactic!" "What a coincidence! But that little human is getting used to it! Be careful not to let them take the Magic Sword! </p>
<p class="calibre1">What Naza shot out was a thin, arrow-like 'Magic Sword'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After hitting the target, or thrusting it into the ground and causing an explosion, the Aisha girls pulled out this 『Magic Sword』 while the enemy they were aiming at was retreating backwards, and 『supplied』 it to their hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The support is supplemented by the armament at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Relying on this, the left flank troops could barely, really barely, maintain the battle line. Aisha also knew very well that without those reinforcements, her side would have been easily defeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ordering  them  to  take  the  『Magic  Sword』  that  Naza  had  replenished  in  her hands, she boldly aimed at Alfrigg and launched an artillery attack on them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Inuyasha! Protect Aisha no matter what you say! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The tough warriors  (these guys) will  be  stopped by the battle whores  (me)! Oh laaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p177"></a>Naza concentrated on the aid of Aisha and life. That is, to the four Gulliver brothers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  other  enemy  troops,  the  tough  warriors,  tried  to  destroy  the  troublesome bowmen,  but  were  pestered  by  the  battle  whores  who  admired  Aisha  with  the consciousness of sending them to their death. Thanks to them, Naza was able to concentrate on aid above these extremely precarious scales. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  herself  kept  moving  from  corridor  to  corridor,  actively  changing  her  sniping location. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There's a good sniper here." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And very discreet." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Part of Hedin's plan had gone haywire. Serves him right." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"We're being held up perfectly, so don't just have fun." </p>
<p class="calibre1">You can see that they are still relaxed, but the four Gulliver brothers also praised Naza with the same frankness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  battle  of  [Freya's  Familia]  was  a  battle  of  annihilation  based  on  the consumption of a sufficient number of "Crozzo's Magic Sword". </p>
<p class="calibre1">And it produced a small mistake because of Naza's critical judgment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Except  for  the  reserve,  all  the  other  troops  fired  the  magic  swords  without  any hesitation - exactly according to Hedin's guidance - and only Naza did not use up the  『Magic  Sword』.  She  gave  up  on  the  hand  of  precision  shooting  with  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Magic  Sword』  that  Lili  had  ordered,  and  gave  priority  to  preserving  herself instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This『Magic Sword』is the lifeline, right ......? Then I can't let go of it easily ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was too reckless before, that's why I got my arm taken away ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naza Orisis, who stopped being an adventurer six years ago, would always fight with 『Insurance』 in mind. The heartbreak of making a mistake in the dungeon exploration  and  having  one  hand  gnawed  away  by  a  monster  took  away  her courage to fight with monsters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it also made her smart and strategic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(It does not matter, I know my own weight. I'm just helping to order them, so, calm down ......!) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naza, who was dripping with sweat, kept counting how many 『Magic Swords』 </p>
<p class="calibre1">left in the quiver, never being greedy, and simply performing her duty of support. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She never thought that she could defeat the first level adventurer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Never considered that she could become a hero. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because of that, Naza made the left flank unit survive for so long. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, that past humiliating experience now saved her companions in a crisis. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But this is just chronic suicide ...... The result is obvious! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p178"></a>At the same time, Naza accurately understood that it was just a desperate struggle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After shooting out all the 『Magic Sword』, the four Gulliver brothers would easily launch a counterattack, and Aisha, Mikoto, or Naza would all be taken care of by them as easily as snapping a baby's neck. They didn't force themselves, they just slowly waited for the balance to be broken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bitterness and resignation flashed across Naza's side face. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">Eight against two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's the number after visualizing the situation of the war game today. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And it's still the number comparison after adding and adding to the allied forces of the faction warlords. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gods of the metropolis watched without a word, while the populace grimaced at the sheer ravages that were still going on. The one-sided superiority of the battle even thwarted the will to show solidarity. Although there is still resistance in some areas that can hardly be called a good fight, in the face of the disparity in power, most of the city residents have moved away one after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The adventurers who are in the vortex of the battle are experiencing a desperation that  far  exceeds  that  of  the  people,  but  are  still  resisting.  Now  this  has  become stubbornness. The enemy is just too overwhelming, their own loss is even a little ridiculous,  so  that  is  why  they  fight  with  all  their  might,  thinking  to  at  least  take revenge. Even if it's a scrape, it's to get the other side in trouble and make them so  angry  that  their  faces  are  crooked.  The  [Freya  familia]  is  so  powerful  that eventually  instead  of  making  the  adventurers  angry,  they  and  they  are  strong warriors, enough to make the adventurers before the war that timid mood into now this idea of giving up everything. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most important thing is to want to see the group of nasty guys crying in front of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, the 'trump card' of the faction's allied forces had not yet died. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The clever adventurers had found out that they were just 『bait』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Realizing that the commander (Lily) was using them and using them as a cover to send that 『White Rabbit』 to the goddess (Freya). </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, even though this was a chance of victory thinner than a spider's thread, there was still hope. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hope should still be there, so they convinced themselves. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So the adventurers fought, fought, kept on fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The people who know very well the unfinished heroes (little rookies) rose up to the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p179"></a>Aisha, who could still move, Mikoto, Naza, Daphne, and Cassandra kept resisting, and Haruhime kept singing, ignoring the huge amount of sweat that sprayed out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then fought, fought, and kept fighting to the end. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">A『boom』that shattered the hope was born. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"--------- ---------- -」" </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a blank on the battlefield. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  "shattering  sound"  that  clutched  all  the  hearts  and  overshadowed  the countless roars boomed out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All those who were fighting on the island stopped fighting. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Both enemies and companions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone looked in that 'direction'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Tough warriors held their breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The adventurers' faces turned pale. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first rank adventurers' expressions did not change, only narrowed their eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking  to  the  『Northwest』  where  the  crowds  of  the  faction  warlords  allied forces had been pretending not to hear, the sound of battle roared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「Stop it now!!! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first one to shed tears was Eina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please ...... stop it ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"E, Eina ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of the "Mirror of God" that reflected the "sight", she brought down the chair and got up violently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After  shouting  with  all  her  might,  tears  streamed  down  from  her  eyes  and  she covered her face with her hands, ignoring the voice of her colleague (Misia). </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who clenched her fists until blood seeped out was Essie. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She blamed and cursed herself for not standing on that  『battlefield』, and  her face took on despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The other first rank adventurers were silent, and only Tiona who was pale at the side was the one who could understand her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell-sama! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The last one to shout out was Lily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This "finality" finally made her confused, and the commander's mask cracked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her trembling maroon pupils were staring at the huge black figure standing in the amphitheater, deep in the crystal. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p180"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1">A martial artist grabbed the teenager's head and lifted him up. </p>
<p class="calibre1"></p>
<p class="calibre1">"............噶............,... ......... ah ............, ...... ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one who leaked out the sound fragment was the teenager whose skull was still creaking now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">His body turned into a piece of rags, his defenses long gone, becoming shattered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  foot  that  left  the  ground  lost  its  target  and  wobbled  unsightly  like  a  broken pendulum. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell Cranel suffered a tragic『complete defeat』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">InuYasha Taketo didn't say a word. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  expression  remained  unchanged  as  he  held  the  big  black  sword  in  his  left hand and clutched the teenager's head with his right hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The rust-colored pupils were still evaluating the boy who had turned into a rag. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't break it, Ottar." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Far away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the old and decaying "House of God", the goddess of beauty, who heard the boom and noticed what had happened, said with her cheeks pressed shut. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no smile or joy on her face, she just took it for granted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stand up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Welp!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The right arm was thrown out gently. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The most mundane action caused Bell's body to plunge into the mountain of falling rubble. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  amphitheater,  where  the  traces  of  the  fierce  battle  were  described,  was completely changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It had been battered by the thunder and lightning and suffered the aftermath of the attack,  and  the  walls  and  audience  seats  had  crumbled  and  countless  slabs  of stone had been lifted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the proof that the unfinished hero (Bell Cranel) resisted with all his might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And in the midst of the battlefield that told how fierce the battle was, Ottar was gut-wrenchingly 'unharmed'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To the teenager, Taketo was an incredible 'despair'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, zzzzz, kahhhhhhh ............! Goo, uhhhh ~~~~~~~~ ............!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell's throat forcibly pulled out the sound of reinvigoration. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p181"></a>With a tide of blood dripping from his wound, he squeezed out what little strength he had and stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Blood poured into his crimson pupils, staining them a deeper red, while he held his left hand, which couldn't stop trembling, forward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--Flame, volt ahhhhhh! </p>
<p class="calibre1">A brave Inferno Ray. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A quick attack magic. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ottar didn't bother to dodge the tip of the scarlet lightning that was flying towards him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It went ping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He didn't even use his big black sword, he just waved his right hand as if repelling mosquitoes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With that alone, the teenager's『magic』dissipated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"----" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Leap. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Before the blood-covered Bell could say nothing, the giant body jumped overhead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenager kicked the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was seriously injured, but he still took the best evasive action that only a first level adventurer can make. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But it still didn't work. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The thick and heavy rigid foot turned the mountain of rubble into open space, and then  it  reached  out  with  a  palm,  grabbed  one  of  Bell's  legs  that  should  have escaped, and then slammed it on top of the stone slab in a circular arc over his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Aaaaaah!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The back landed on the ground, and Bell itself became a hammer that crushed the ground. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A strong impact. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A barren thunderbolt (spark) stimulated the back that pain had lost its meaning. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  report  of  the  damage  was  not  even  considered  a  normal  sound,  so  it  was shown in the form of a painful cry, and in his eyes, the blue sky gradually lost its proper appearance. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, Bell's consciousness was literally on the verge of breaking, and just then, the merciless sole of his shoe struck him in the abdomen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"------ yelp." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Awakening. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p182"></a>Initiate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inferno. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forced 『Recovery』 using pain and shock, now he even misses the healing of the young girl (Haider) a bit, misses it enough to shed tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Stand up." </p>
<p class="calibre1">It won't end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell's scarred body had nothing left but despair, and the Mushi's 'baptism' would never end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The man's unemotional pupils looked down at the boy's face, which had become a mess from blood and tears, and said to him, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Remember. This is the taste of 'clay'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The teenager said 'stop fighting' in a faint voice, but naturally it did not reach his ears, and his right hand reached out to grab the teenager's collar and threw him again at high speed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Boom and shatter.  The slender body with white  hair bounced like a rabbit dead wreck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In front of the fragmented stone wall wreckage, Bell fell like a broken puppet, his lips pressed to the ground, and the pool of blood quietly spread outward. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing  this  sight,  Eina  finally  lower  half  of  the  body,  weak,  paralyzed  on  the ground, can not stop crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin, who saw this sight with his elf eyes, was expressionless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell, June ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia, who understood this tragic situation through Lily's eye crystal, felt a bone chilling feeling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"---! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... where are you going, Asfi." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you even need to ask that! Absolutely not to let it go to waste!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Asfi sprang to his feet, turned his back on the expressionless god (Hermes), and rushed out holding the glowing magic prop. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell Cranel was ............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Isn't that brat ............ all Lv. 5? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even the world's fastest rabbit can't be defeated ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a tavern in the city, the wise adventurers who did not participate in the war were bewildered. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking up at the image of the 'mirror', all of them were dominated by terror, when one of the adventurers said. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p183"></a>"Idiots. Who do you think that guy is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was a skilled adventurer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was a skilled adventurer, an orc who had survived the chaos of seven years ago, and said with fear and trembling hatred. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That guy is Ottar." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the answer. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The absolute solution that needs no proof. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The strongest in the city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lv. 7. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"King."</p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell's quietly twitching body fell sideways, and the crimson vision reflected only the figure of a king. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you want to bear the favor of that lord, you have to surpass me first. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young man who was suffering from endless "baptism" and shedding tears of blood felt his "end". </p>
