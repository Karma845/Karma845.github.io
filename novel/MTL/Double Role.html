<p class="calibre1">Every time, the last place I reached was always a 'field of flowers'. </p>

<p class="calibre1">When I was in the Tenkai, I was not particularly free. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Among all the gods, the "God of Beauty" is a very special kind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This omnipotence is both manna and poison at the same time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The power contained in 'charm', which is enough to affect the gods, is irresistible and can even destroy divine reasoning. While the Great God and many other gods desire us as 'beautiful gods', they also have fear in their hearts. It is not uncommon for them to want to take us as subordinate gods and turn us into their own puppets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, there are only two ways to deal with 'beautiful gods'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Destroy them completely, or take care of them like a princess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Generally speaking, the latter is adopted. Then a virgin goddess is placed closer to her as a safety device. For example, the one who is also a goddess of beauty is often taught a lesson by the god of purity. In order to prohibit us from performing </p>
<p class="calibre1">'aggression' or 'domination' in the Tenkai, the guardians of this realm can activate their powers at will, which is an unwritten rule. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So I was also under surveillance, and my movements were restricted - not really. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even the virgin goddesses are "charmed" by me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I am a special god among the "gods of beauty". </p>
<p class="calibre1">All the other gods worship and fear me so much, whether I want to or not. I'm afraid that the only ones who can really counter my power are the three goddesses of Heaven's Peak. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Therefore, I am under strict 'management'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On  the  surface,  this  place  is  a  paradise  to  do  as  I  please.  In  essence,  it  is  an endless prison in which I am trapped. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The great temple in the Tenkai that was given to me, and the many gods and spirits that guard it, are all "shackles" that bind me. The God who created this prison had a  clear  idea  of  my  interests  and  hobbies.  He  sought  out  these  beings  that  the queen could not abandon, and used even their pure feelings with them to become the  "chains"  that  bound  me.  He  himself  was  living  a  leisurely  life  in  a  place unaffected by 『charmed』, and when something happened he would throw in a divine gun to kill me. That's what that obnoxious old god should be thinking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, I never lamented my own lack of freedom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although there were countless grievances in my heart, I accepted the status quo as the god of 'beauty' and 'love'. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p8"></a>This is not irony, after all, I am loved by all the gods and enjoy more honorable treatment  than  any  god.  It  would  be  laughable  to  feel  unfortunate.  The  most important thing is that I myself looked away long before I was put in the cage, and was in a position to recognize and see everything. </p>

<p class="calibre1">After all, isn't this just "playing house"? </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one would disobey me, nor could they. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone knelt on the ground, thirsting for my 'love'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how strong the martial gods, no matter how evil the evil gods, they were all incredibly attentive in order to obtain my 'love'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And in turn, if I seek each other's 'love', then no matter what kind of existence, they will offer their 'love'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I began to feel that love is the most empty thing in all the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Maybe no one will understand me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Perhaps no one will understand my feelings. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, the paradox of these people craving for my love and then offering their </p>
<p class="calibre1">"free love" when asked by the goddess is really twisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Beauty" and "love" can become either a dark abyss of desire or a pure white plain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This has nothing to do with "charm". </p>
<p class="calibre1">As long as I am a "god of beauty", this emptiness will always haunt me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In other words, as the goddess of beauty and love, I can never escape from this </p>
<p class="calibre1">"yoke" called emptiness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This made me realize that I am a slave of Love, who is in charge of Love. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how much I pretend that I am reckless, no matter how much I pretend that  I  am  a  cruel  witch,  I  will  never  be  able  to  break  free  from  the  yoke  of  the Goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the last time, I will show my "real smile" from my heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When was the last time I showed a real smile from my heart, not a mask-like smile that charmed everyone? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I can't remember. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Love' is so convenient. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You can get anything you want. There is nothing you can't get. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Love is so beautiful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It can create happiness. When you cultivate happiness, it brings out the envy of others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Love is beautiful. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p9"></a>It must be beautiful too. If it were not beautiful, it would not be called 'love'. </p>

<p class="calibre1">After all, you can't call it "love" by calculating gains and losses. If there is a little bit of ugliness, it is disqualified from being called 'love'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Otherwise, sex would not be ridiculed, and narcissism would not be condemned. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Love must be sacred. All people have the fantasy of love. "Love is without a doubt the most noble and beautiful thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, if I am no longer beautiful, will I be forgotten by Love? </p>
<p class="calibre1">If I give up my beauty, will I break free from the yoke of the Goddess? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wanted to get dirty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So I tried to make myself dirty. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I cowered in this birdcage called prison, surrounded by male gods, and craved all kinds of pleasures. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I also called the goddesses and tried all the filthy things I could think of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is no comparison with the streams of the lecherous capital. In the boredom of  the  Tenkai,  if  there  is  a  place  where  the  most  moral  harm  is  done,  it  is undoubtedly  the  great  temple  where  I  am  imprisoned.  I  spent  hundreds  of thousands of years drowning in a sea of lust and carnal desire. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then,  at  a  certain  moment,  being  a  god  but  surrounded  by  a  deep  sense  of weariness, I noticed something. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pairs of eyes that looked at me from all around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gaze of 'love' that looked at me with heat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no change. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No change! </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how filthy it is, no one will abandon me even if I spend almost forever! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Yoke of the Goddess" is still on me! </p>
<p class="calibre1">I shouted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the first time, I threw away "character" and other things and rushed out of the great temple. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I crossed the mountains, the valleys, the sea, and the stars. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I took on the appearance of a girl, one of a hundred appearances, and wandered through the endless realm of heaven, shaking off my pursuers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What she finally reached was a vast sea of flowers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was no longer a boundary between heaven and earth, and in the middle of the beautiful sea of red flowers, my knees weakened and I sat down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I did not cry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, tears kept falling from my eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p10"></a>Ahhh, it is true that I was dominated by this emotion of looking down on everything, and my intense feelings had long since turned into a dry desert. So even though I didn't feel sad at all, I still covered my face with my hands like a little girl. The rain that could not be stopped turned into gold and  flowed down  along  a red flower, wetting the earth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn't find it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I couldn't find it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And I don't know what I am looking for. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But I must be seeking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeking "something" to free me from the "yoke of the goddess". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Teardrops of emptiness without sorrow flowed for a thousand, two thousand, or maybe three thousand nights. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And when the petals were scattered, the roots were bent, and the fountain of gold was about to submerge me, she appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess of the same town. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  had  the  beauty  of  a  goddess  of  beauty,  but  she  was  an  innocent  god  of goodness,  and  she  said  she  couldn't  stand  my  lustful  life,  so  she  came  to reprimand me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  said  that  she  had  searched  around  for  a  long  time  and  was  covered  with sweat, and then  she spoke passionately  about "youth" based  on the things  she was in charge of. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said that men and women should be more relaxed with each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said that both sweetness and suffering should be faced together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said, "No matter how long it takes, the soul should remain young. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She said, "So let's be youthful with me too. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I was thinking, "Let's kill her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So I stood up, went behind her, who was talking to herself, and grabbed her slender neck with both hands. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So Freya, go find your partner, right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">--Mate? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I stopped moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess didn't even notice that she was about to be strangled and replied with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The partner who can satisfy you must be somewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Go enjoy a green spring day with that being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I think that must be able to make you break free from the bondage of the yoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing this, I snickered at the goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p11"></a>How could there be such a being, I laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, I decided to believe the goddess' nonsense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, there was no evidence that it did not exist. <b class="calibre3"> </b></p>

<p class="calibre1">On the surface, this place is a paradise where I can do as I please. In essence, it is an endless prison in which I am trapped. </p>

<p class="calibre1">And when the petals were scattered, the roots were bent, and the fountain of gold was about to drown me, she appeared. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess of the hometown (Eden). </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had a beauty almost equal to that of the "goddess of beauty", but she was an innocent god of goodness, and she said she couldn't stand my lustful life, so she came to reprimand me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  said  that  she  had  searched  around  for  a  long  time  and  was  covered  with sweat, and then  she spoke passionately  about "youth" based on the things  she was in charge of. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"So Freya, go find your mate (Odr), right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">--Mate (Odr)? </p>
<p class="calibre1">I stopped moving. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess didn't even notice that she was almost choked to death and replied with a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p15"></a>The companion (Odr) that can satisfy you must be somewhere. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Go and enjoy a green spring day with that being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I think that must be able to make you break free from the yoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I heard this, I laughed at the goddess (Eden). </p>
<p class="calibre1">How can there be such a being, I laughed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, I decided to believe in the nonsense of the goddess Eden. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, there was no evidence that it didn't exist. </p>

<p class="calibre1">I  returned  to  the  shrine,  stirred  up  the  surrounding  area,  and  from  there,  I developed a twisted collecting fetish. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I began collecting beautiful things, especially looking out over the souls of children and finding in them a presence that was uniquely mine. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then time and time again, I snuck out of the temple where the storm had subsided. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Each time was a journey in search of a companion (Ode). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Like the onset of the disease, I would take on the appearance of a girl and travel to the boundless world of the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Time after time, I slipped out and cleverly avoided the pursuers, but I never found my partner (Oded), which made me more and more disappointed. Not wanting to be consumed by the poison of boredom, I sought excitement, occasionally coping with the gods who came together, while continuing my wandering journey. It must have been at that time that I occasionally met the virgin goddess (Hestia) in the guise of the goddess (Freya). </p>
<p class="calibre1">I met the goddess (Eden) again, and she asked with a leisurely smile 『Have you found your mate (Oded) yet-? , while I choked her almost to death, I understood one thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There is only one thing that we, 『Megami』, cannot get. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is because we are more beautiful than anything else. It is because of『Love』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I thought about what other『Beauty Gods』would think, and immediately gave up again. It was obvious that it was a waste of time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Other 'gods of beauty' would never be as troubled as I was. They don't doubt that they  are  the  absolute  queen,  and  they  take  all  favors  and  devotion  for  granted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">They claim that they are the supreme being and do not care about other things. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The arrogant goddess of beauty (Ishtar) is truly enviable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The stupid goddess of beauty (Aphrodite) is enviable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if they find 『they are able to scorn it, or else they turn it into a wound that has already healed. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p16"></a>So, I spent a long time searching the entire Tenkai. </p>
<p class="calibre1">My partner (Odr) is not in this Ocean of Heaven. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, it was time to go to the 'lower world' next time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It  happened  to  be  the  divine  age  when  the  gods  began  to  descend,  so  I  joined them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ostensibly  to  relieve  the  boredom  of  the  Tenkai  and  to  dream  of  finding  new possibilities in an imperfect world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And a hunger and thirst to meet the miraculous 'unknown'  - to meet my  partner (Oded). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Yet. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This small lower world was so much smaller than the heavenly world that a glance at the edge turned my prayers into immediate despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The horizontal earth had all been searched, and after that, all that was left was to wait for the vertical flow of time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that time, I felt very tired after having established a [familia]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even when I was smiling like a queen in front of my lovely children, I was thinking that I might as well fall into eternal sleep, consumed by the poison of boredom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One day, I arrived at a place where I was alone, cleverly avoiding my Familia, and it happened to have a landscape similar to that of my hometown in the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a field of red flowers sunken in the dusk. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I went to the center of the field of flowers, sat down and shed tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This time, it was accompanied by sadness, bearing the snicker of the yoke, and desperately suppressing the despair in my heart. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Probably, that was the first and the last tears shed in the lower world. </p>

<p class="calibre1">...... ah ah, I said wrong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, the girl also shed tears in front of you ah. </p>
