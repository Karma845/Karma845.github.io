<p class="calibre1">I am looking at a dream. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is neither the current me (Horn) nor the former me (Syr), but the memory (dream) of 'her'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was very lonely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although surrounded by 'love', she doesn't feel the slightest satisfaction. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To  some  people,  this  gesture  might  seem  very  arrogant  and  extravagant  to  the point of being offensive. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this lower world, there are many people who grew up and lost their lives before they knew 'love'. Once I (Syr) was one of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, because she knew what "love" was better than anyone else, she had a void that people who did not know "love" could never understand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Because she is not wrapped in love, she is able to crave it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And because I am wrapped in love, I am imprisoned by it and die in it over and over again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I can't tell which side is more unfortunate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If there is anything that I can say, it is that under the scale of eternity, even "love" </p>
<p class="calibre1">can become a hell full of poison. </p>

<p class="calibre1">In my memory (dream), she was crying in a field of flowers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With her hands over her face, tears fell, and the field of red flowers dyed with dusk seemed to turn into a sea of gold, while she was immersed in sorrow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Can't find it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Couldn't find it. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p77"></a>She kept sighing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Eventually ...... a woman appeared behind her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a not too tall dwarf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At first, the somewhat aggressive dwarf was taken aback by her beauty and tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She immediately stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You saw it, right? she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tears disappeared and the pupils were tinged with silver. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Forget what you saw, she was about to be so 'charming'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dwarf's body jerked and staggered closer, then at the very moment she tried to give the order </p>

<p class="calibre1">A fierce uppercut was thrown. </p>

<p class="calibre1">It was a  beautiful uppercut that even frightened  me, and I leaned back violently with an "eh eh...". </p>
<p class="calibre1">She sat down on her butt with a violent blow to the chin. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hanada caught her, and the red petals instantly fluttered into the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Looking at her who rubbed her chin and her eyes rolled white, the dwarf female showed a malevolent ghost-like look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't give me any weird moves! I'll send you flying! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dwarf who had already knocked her away was extremely angry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although she was seen shedding tears, which caused her heart to be shaken and </p>
<p class="calibre1">'charmed'  a  little  late,  but  to  be  able  to  knock  her  away  before  her  words  were obeyed showed that the dwarf was indeed very strong. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dumbfounded, she said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm a goddess, right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dwarven woman grunted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I don't care what you are! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since she was born, she had never worshiped any transcendent being herself, and when she heard the dwarf say so boldly, she also laughed out loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And it was a loud laugh without a care in the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She once again collapsed in the middle of the flower field, shrinking into a ball like a fetus, covering her stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although  it  wasn't  intentional,  it  was  the  dwarf  female  who  took  away『her  first time』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She had become the woman who had hit her for the first time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She couldn't stop laughing. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p78"></a>"『I ask you, what is your name? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"『...... Mia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So she decided to pester the dwarf who had a disgusted face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dwarf was born in some mining area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When she passed, the environment was already very bad and the coal mines were almost all gone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The males were all driven out to work as miners, and the only ones left in the village were thin women and children. In  order to feed these people, the dwarf woman opened a tavern alone - a canteen with the name of a tavern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I met her because the dwarves were collecting ingredients for the poor area. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The gods are not as important as eating! I don't want gems, but ingredients to fill my stomach! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dwarves know better than anyone how painful hunger is. They also believe that a warm meal is much more valuable than a beautiful jewel or a beautiful goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the Tenkai, where hunger and poverty have nothing to do with each other and where there is no perfection, there can be no such sight. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, she thought: this is the nature of the lower world, right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is because of imperfection that the "unknown", which cannot be predicted by the gods, is born, and the dwarf in front of her is nurtured. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the representative of 'unknown' is 'hero'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, the partner she was looking for (Oded) might be the "hero" itself, and from that moment on, she began to think so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Are you my hero (Odr)? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What a silly thing to say. Stupid goddess." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  cast  an  expectant  glance,  but  the  dwarf  could  be  said  to  have  paid  no attention. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dwarven female was the cook who was pure to her dismay, with a face stained with soot, feeding someone's Belly, the Belly-full Cinderella (Andrzej Limnir). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This dwarf would never worship her who appeared in front of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The many gods, led by the Great God, tried their best to get hold of her, but the hillbilly dwarf had no idea what value she possessed. Nor do they intend to find out. Maybe it's because the encounter between the two was that kind of situation, or maybe it's because the dwarf is just sky-high. I think it must be both. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  first  time  I  saw  her,  I  was  able  to  treat  her  rudely,  and  even  spanked  her unmercifully, as if she were a worldly treasure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how much the strong dependents glared, the dwarves would not change their attitude. Faced with warriors far more powerful than themselves, but still did </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p79"></a>not throw away their pride of being a man with a full stomach. The people in this area  were  all  attracted  to  her  and  shrunk  into  a  ball,  while  she  kept  cooking. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Obviously, she did not receive 『bounty』, but she has a strong soul that does not yield to the divine might. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This dwarf is really very strange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The encounter with this dwarf made her feel a little bit of salvation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I took the liberty of saving your area, Mia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I gave them a proper occupation, and I also made sure that the area would never be deserted again. You don't have to cook for them anymore, do you? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"By the way, there is a goddess here who is always hungry." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... You dumb goddess!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">She was very fond of the dwarf and welcomed her into her familia with a little force. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  dwarf  probably  hated  the  fact  that  he  owed  her  a  favor  for  liberating  his homeland, so he grumbled and accepted the 'favor'. Only, it came with a condition. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Work under her until the favor is paid off," "If there are hungry people like in the hometown, they will go there," "Also, to fulfill the dwarf's long-held wish of opening a real tavern. These were the terms of exchange. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She accepted these concessions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On top of that, she also said this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Listen to me, Mia. I'm looking for a partner (Ode). </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've heard you say it so many times. I'm not going to be one of those things, and I'm not going to help you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No problem, I thought you'd say that. So, I want you to sign a contract with me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Contract ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After all, it's you, so if I do something to upset you, you'll punch me again, right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I will do anything for my partner (Odr), and I can be a good saint or an ugly witch." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, Mia. Whether I become a good woman or a bad woman, don't come in my way, okay? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please, Mia." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............ I know." </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  there  was  anyone  who  could  prevent  her  from  achieving  her  wish,  it  was  the dwarf in front of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p80"></a>She had a hunch about it. So first, she accepted the dwarf's conditions and then proposed a contract. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Unexpectedly, the dwarf agreed easily. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why is that? She thought so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then immediately thought 'Ahhh, that's right', showing understanding. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, the dwarf never wanted to see her cry like a miserable little girl again - </p>

<p class="calibre1">She took the dwarf and continued on her journey to find her mate (Oded). </p>
<p class="calibre1">While traveling around this wide, but narrower than the lower world of heaven, she cherished the dwarves very much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Inwardly, she decided that the only thing she will not do is to compel the dwarves with "charm". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Dwarf women are very noble. They are not as glorious as elfs, they are rude and violent,  but  their  will  is  stronger  than  anyone  else.  She  cherished  this  only  one dwarf who would resist her, and despite being too much younger than herself, her heart still looked up to the dwarf as a sister. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  she  found  that  even  this  stiff  dwarf,  as  long  as  she  had  this  heart,  would make the dwarf go crazy from 'beauty'. If the dwarf also sought 'love' from her, she would never be able to pull herself together again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The journey continues. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her  partner  (Oded)  was  not  found,  and  she  slumped  her  shoulders  in  defeat several times, but her Familia who worshiped her grew stronger and stronger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One day, she lost to the 'worst and most vicious goddess' and was imprisoned in the middle of the labyrinth city. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While settling in the center of the world, she still searched for a mate (Oded). </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the process, she welcomed the son of a pig man. </p>
<p class="calibre1">From the ugly island of elfs where white and black fought each other, two kings were released. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sold her body in the industrial city and acquired the prum quadruplets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  the  abandoned  world,  I  picked  up  two  kittens  who  were  dependent  on  each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I (Horn), too, was saved by her in the slums of that winter. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The number of warriors who pledged their loyalty to her and had the power grew. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But even so, she still could not find a mate (Oded). </p>
<p class="calibre1">The dwarf also applied to leave her side when the dark age of the city was about to fall. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p81"></a>From that day on, giving up her mate (Odr), she started role-playing when she was consumed by the poison of boredom. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Then, she made friends. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Had another place to stay. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The poison of resignation, looking away from everything, and boredom that had strangled the goddess inside was also neutralized. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She loved every day of her life as a 'girl'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I wonder if she noticed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it was just a game, each day of being a 'girl' replaced the gold she shed and nourished her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was『girl』that allowed her to approach her『expectation』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But ...... ah ah. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She reached there again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In this world of fantasy (dream), I reached that beautiful and lonely field of flowers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Couldn't find it, couldn't find it, and she was still sighing so much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Since that day, she has been crying. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"Cry it out. Cry it out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just because you are not by my side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The garden of flowers, the bright red tears, the gold in full bloom. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Let the light that has not yet been seen guide you and me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Laugh it out. Laugh it out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">believe in your heart that we will meet at last. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Somewhere the poem of tears rings out. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Her hero (Oded) finally appeared, and she was still crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And all I can do is stand on the outside and watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Someone came to her rescue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Come and give her a hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I (Horn) prayed so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But no one reached out to her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was she herself who abandoned them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I (Horn) did not stop either, but assisted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the time I (I) noticed the tears, it was too late. </p>

<p class="calibre1">I'm sorry, Anya. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p82"></a> </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm sorry, Chloe. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sorry, Runoa. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Sorry, Ryu. </p>

<p class="calibre1">I'm sorry ...... Mia. </p>

<p class="calibre1">She apologized as she cried. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I also expressed my apologies together. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But she still couldn't stop her tears. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gold was still flowing, while her body was melting away to the naked eye. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I held her in my arms and said the words she must not have been able to say. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Come and stop me-- </p>
<p class="calibre1">Save me-- </p>
