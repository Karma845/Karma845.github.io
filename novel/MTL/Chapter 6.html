<h1 class="calibre3">Chapter 6: Goddess turns to conquest ~Orali Mime~: The hair has become longer.</h1>

<p class="calibre1">Unknowingly, it had crossed the neck and hitched up the back. </p>

<p class="calibre1">Reaching out and grabbing it, the real blonde hair was visible in the bundle of hair dyed light green. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was always she who dyed her hair to hide her true identity, and it was always she who cut her hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The gentle eyes that were reflected in the mirror at that time are now unreachable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The smile that appeared at the corner of my mouth is no longer smoothly recalled. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The woman who cut my hair is no longer there. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I rejected her, and she left me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">When I think about it now, it seems that this was the ending she wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What was she thinking while she was combing my hair? </p>
<p class="calibre1">What kind of feelings were she complimenting me on the beauty of my hair? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Was all the time we spent together a lie? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Anger and sadness surfaced and disappeared along with the question that I don't know how many times I had repeated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Role-playing," said the pale gray eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What happened in the bountiful tavern was all "play," she declared clearly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There are as many things that I don't understand as mountains. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The number of times I have been hurt is countless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Should I shout, 'You betrayed me'? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or should I cry, 'You have cheated me'? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Or would it have been easier if I had cursed, 'Give us back our innocence'? </p>
<p class="calibre1">While being locked in the basement, I kept thinking about such things. </p>

<p class="calibre1">However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">I suddenly realized one thing. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She hadn't changed at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, she never did what she wanted to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While  saying  things  like  she  valued  us,  she  never  said  anything  about  herself, harboring numerous secrets. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just  a  moment  ago,  she  was  laughing  and  smiling,  and  then  in  an  instant,  she slipped from her hands lightly. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p19"></a>She has always been like a casual 'wind'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the same now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  finished  her  situation  unilaterally,  and  then  she  was  ready  to  break  off  the relationship without permission. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But I haven't understood anything yet, and haven't even decided what to believe. </p>
<p class="calibre1">By the way- </p>
<p class="calibre1">I hadn't finished talking to her yet, and hadn't said enough about myself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then- </p>
<p class="calibre1">I should have the right to say back 'none of my business' and force myself to her eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No matter how she asserted in a derisive tone that it was all fun and games so far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After all, I haven't been able to make her reveal even a single thought in her mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">You want to abandon the body of the street maiden and pretend to be a capricious queen, you do just that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For now only, Blast (I) will also turn into a fierce『Raging Arashi』. </p>

<p class="calibre1">"...... The thing you said is here. I picked it up in that battle." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Outside the walls of the city, I got it from them who were standing in front of the gate. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The broken piece of wood. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I thanked the leader who had come from the Labyrinth Inn, and slowly tilted my head up to look at the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The sun had not yet risen, when night and morning met. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I could see the stars shining in the slightly bright sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had already decided that I would never take my eyes off these countless stars again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lord Hermes asked me to give this to you. ......『That lord』seems to be in the Sword Smithing City Solingen in the far east. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I looked at my friend who brought the message from the Lord God and  nodded with a sense of gratitude. </p>
<p class="calibre1">With her help, I had completed the preparations for departure. </p>
<p class="calibre1">All that remained to be done was to say goodbye to the city for the time being. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I looked at the endless horizon and turned my back to the city walls. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For the sake of him with gray hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For her with light gray hair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And for myself, who had been hiding my blond hair until now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I had to go to the final "purification". </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p20"></a>I looked out at the stars still shining, and the words I whispered floated on the wind towards the city behind me. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Wait for me, Syr. I won't be able to get over it until I slap you hard in the face. </p>





<p class="calibre1">The unheard of 'War Game' was decided to be held... </p>

<p class="calibre1">The news spread quickly in Orario. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The residents of the Labyrinth City had not been able to clear their memories due to the mass "charm" and "invasion" caused by the "God of Beauty", and now the news was so strong that everyone's mind was in a state of confusion. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya's Familia] versus the "United Faction". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The people, who could only go with the flow, naturally did not know whether this strange and unheard of form was the consensus of the governing body and the gods, or whether it was Freya's own method. However, there was no doubt that everyone  had  a  feeling  that  this  would  become  the  "biggest  war  game"  in  the history of Orario. The news of the "Faction War" even flew over the huge walls of the city and shook the city beyond. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What's going on? Those who couldn't keep up with the situation shouted so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Those who couldn't keep up with the situation shouted, "This is how it should be," </p>
<p class="calibre1">and those whose memories were being manipulated raged. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is simply not strong enough, said someone else so hatefully. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But  the  most  voices  among  them  came  from  people  who  could  not  hide  their confusion, who asked worriedly what would become of them after this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  merchants  were  the  only  ones  who  didn't  have  the  heart  to  explore  the business opportunities this time, they were all worried whether the city could still maintain 'balance'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even the gods were no exception. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One  by  one,  they  all  put  away  their  usual  frivolous  attitudes  and  seriously considered their future course of action. There were still many gods who were busy stopping impulsive dependents - adventurers who wanted to sign up for the war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In any case, no one would want to say anything to forgive the atrocities of [Freya's Familia]. Although they were shocked by the war game, there was the destruction </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p21"></a>of Pleasant Street in the past, and the discontent caused by the numerous acts of aggressive behavior so far finally exploded at this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's right. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In today's situation, the queen (Freya) can be said to be isolated. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To say the least, no one would openly state that they were on her side. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--Even so, the number of desperate people who wanted to fight against the "entire army of the gods of beauty" was definitely not too many. </p>


<p class="calibre1">"What do you mean? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia's loud voice resonated throughout the room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the middle of the hall where the columns were holding up the high ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On the 30th floor of the Tower of Babel, which stood in the middle of the city, the gods were holding a "divine meeting". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why aren't you participating in the war games, Loki? </p>
<p class="calibre1">Pound! There was a loud bang. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia's hands slammed down on the round table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loki, who was sitting at the opposite corner of her table, tightly pursed his lips in the shape of a 'へ'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... What can we do? That's the way it is." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Things, my ass!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia shouted unilaterally while the hall was also a hubbub. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The purpose of this "God's Meeting" was to discuss the details (rules) of the "War Game" match. The purpose of this meeting was to discuss the details (rules) of the </p>
<p class="calibre1">"War Game" and to determine the list of the allied forces that would participate in the "United Faction" led by the "Hestia Familia". </p>
<p class="calibre1">It goes without saying that the [Loki Familia], which is able to stand up to the [Freya Familia], is the most powerful candidate. But now it was a 'no'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A strong shakeup swept through the entire council. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The ripples from the turmoil were still spreading outward in the "Council of Gods", which had the highest attendance rate of all gods in history. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Shouldn't you be the primary force to beat up Freya? But now that it's come to this, you're suddenly saying "I'm not going to participate~". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're the one who proudly threw out the phrase ''war games'' ......' </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I said that because I thought you'd be the first one to participate because you're so impulsive! I was going to rely on Warren and the others! Otherwise, how could I have fought against the terrifying Freya and the others? </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p22"></a>"Usually  so  afraid  of  them,  but  now  you  are  counting  on  it,  do  not  you  feel ashamed ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the symbol of the young goddesses as if they were enjoying themselves, Loki put on a speechless expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, Hestia also has long been unable to care so much. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She poked her body out and kept shouting at Loki, with a fierce air as if she wanted to spray spittle onto the other party's face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Look around you! Just because you said you won't appear, the people who were eager to fight just now have lost their courage too! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The main gods who were now spying on the movements of the faction valves all pulled back a bit from Hestia, both physically and psychologically. Specifically, they pulled  back  their  chairs  to  five  paces  away  from  the  round  table  and  gave perfunctory smiles of "hahaha" and "heh heh heh". </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If the Joker faction (Loki familia) does not participate in the war, who will stabilize the monsters (Ottar and the others)? </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the unanimous voice of the gods. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If the situation is not favorable, they will protect themselves. People are like this, the gods are also like this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loki looked around, and then reluctantly said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Let's put it this way ...... to be frank, if we engage in a serious battle, won't it be </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Loki and Freya are fighting"? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Whoo ......!?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Of course, nominally, it would only be "Hestia and Freya fighting". But then, you'd be incidental? ...... Then it's not the main god's proxy war, it's your (dwarf's) proxy war. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's not [Freya's familia] vs [Hestia's familia] and supporters. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead,  it  may  become  [Freya's  Familia]  vs  [Loki's  Familia]  +  many  other adventurers. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is what Loki meant beyond words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To be honest, Hestia also felt that this was indeed the case. Therefore she was speechless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For Freya, who had gambled her wealth and reputation, and even her own reserve to face this battle, it seemed a bit ugly and not very reasonable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But after all, the enemy was too strong,  so she was now in  a position to say, "I don't care about such things (decency)! "I don't care about that! I don't care about that! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But, if that's the case, at least pick a few people to fight ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p23"></a>"That's forbidden too. ...... is the guild's work." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although Freya herself proposed the "war game", as it is now, it is just a public execution. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This will make other countries look funny, and since it is said to be a 'war game', it is best to maintain a minimum of fairness - this seems to be the guild's 'argument'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Apollo and I were more unreasonable than that back then-!" She just commented. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If you're lazy and don't recruit, that's what happens. And there was a good point in front of her. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a result, Hestia could only mutter "Gnuu" under her breath. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This was a 'war of factions' where there were many against one, all special cases. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naturally, there would be no complete rules, so it was only natural, but... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia glanced at the corner of the round table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There  was  an  empty  seat  directly  opposite  to  her.  The  Queen's  seat  that  was supposed to face Hestia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Freya was not present at this 'divine meeting'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  declared  that  the  method  of  deciding  the  winner  and  the  detailed  rules,  no matter how unfavorable the conditions were to her, she would "accept them all". </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess of beauty even gave up her right to reside at the top of the 『Tower of Babel』, and is now eerily silent on the throne of the capital (base), waiting for the decision of the metropolis. Freya, who had used everything she had built up as capital (leverage) to demand war, was still a queen. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That is to say, the guild will not allow a war that could overthrow Orario. We have no choice but to see you through, since the tiger has ordered us to..." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... talk a good game, but don't let us find out that you're actually being held by Freya in the end, right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"--- Surprise! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Hestia's softly uttered words, Loki was obviously a bit woebegone. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a moment, Hestia's eyebrows rose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So that's how it is! I just wondered how you could be so honest and listen to the guild when you are so warlike! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are you talking about? We're not being blackmailed for not paying back the money we owe or the eagle feathers we borrowed during the Celestial Age! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You're just a bad god! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia and Loki, who had risen from their chairs, argued loudly, and Hephaestus, Miach, and Takemikazuchi, who were watching the situation, sighed deeply. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After a while. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p24"></a>Loki, who had been thoroughly chastised, sighed a long sigh and sat back in his chair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... If we could, we would have participated in the war. That nymphomaniac is so excessive this time. We can't get over it without giving her a shot. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But there's a reason we can't do that." </p>
<p class="calibre1">She asserted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loki had a sad look on her face, as if she was really quite reluctant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She looked very determined. No, there was some "reason" that distorted her divine will to return the favor to Freya. And Loki wasn't going to say it out loud. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia had no other choice but to give up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Also as  a god, she  knew very well that  the divine will  that  had become like this could no longer be changed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... understand. I won't say anymore to let you participate officially. However, at least you can let Warren so-and-so-kun to do a favor, right?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia was silent for a long time and finally made a bargain. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if we can't fight together, we must at least lend the person over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell-kun and Warren-something-kun the two, that ...... what to say, in the battle style this layer of meaning, very close to each other. So I want that child to come and help until the war games start." </p>
<p class="calibre1">In order not to let the gods who came to the meeting here notice the truth about </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Rare Skill』, she made a request vaguely. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia knew what the source of [One Heart Longing] was, so she knew very well how much of a leap the exercise or battle with Ace would bring to Bell. Just like before the war games with the sun god (Apollo), special training with her made the teenager grow rapidly and eventually exploded cold (Giant Killing). </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Hestia's plea, Loki looked at her motionlessly ...... and then shook his head feebly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What ......! Why, why ah!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ace can't move anymore." </p>
<p class="calibre1">This resigned tone made Hestia a bit of a wreck. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Loki, on the other hand, leaned back against the back of the chair and raised his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That child is now, the most tightly bound by the 『Contract』." </p>


<p class="calibre1"><a id="p25"></a> </p>




<p class="calibre1">On the vast 『wilderness』 surrounded by morning mist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was a cold autumn morning like winter, and the sun was not yet shining. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Izzy was facing the pig-man male. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I will convey the words of the goddess. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's time to return the favor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The price you have to pay is silence." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"! ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ace's tightly closed lips shook for a moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"No involvement in anything to do with Bell Cranel." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The deadline is until the end of the duel (war games). Considering what happened in the wilderness (here), the two should be equivalent." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"You want to say it's unacceptable? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After all, it's a verbal agreement. If you want to break the 'contract', I won't stop you." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is ............ okay? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Except that your sword will rot and fall into the mud at that moment. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How can a sword that can't keep its oath not become dull? </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the middle of the green sea with only two people, Ottar didn't say anything more. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The pigman wielder turned his back on Ace, and his figure disappeared into the depths of the mist. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Left in the battle wilderness, with only her left, Ace pursed her lips hard and tilted her head to look up at the sky. </p>
<p class="calibre1">".................. Bell." </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm sorry. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That was the only thing that Ace tried desperately to squeeze out. </p>

<p class="calibre1"><a id="p26"></a> </p>





<p class="calibre1">"What's going on, Royman." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The little human's voice was full of accusations. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A strand of sweat dripped down the face of Guildmaster Royman Madir, but still stared steadfastly back into the eyes of Finn Dimna who questioned him. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It is clearly written in the notice. You [Loki Familia] cannot be allowed to participate in the war games." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The little human and the elf looked at each other with unblinking eyes across the table in the middle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is a small cafe built in a small alley away from the avenue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn and Royman were having a confidential conversation between just the two of them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can you give us a reason why we should accept it?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Neither  do  we  need  to  explain  nor  do  we  need  to  make  you  accept.  The  [Loki Familia] and the [Freya Familia] are the two forces known as the 'Twin Heads of the City'. Like the strongest faction valves (Zeus and Hera), you must maintain an excellent balance and remain at the top of the Orario! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Royman aggravated his tone, his intention was very obvious. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Loki and Freya must not be allowed to clash in the war games, leading to a conflict between the two". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Driven by this idea, he was about to pour a pot of cold water on this 'great war'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then  with  its  revolting  mental  preparation  -  in  an  almost  dictatorial  manner,  I'm afraid - he was going to force it through. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The evidence is that Royman is pressing one hand to his Belly, which is all flabby, and rubbing it constantly. His face also looks bad. I'm afraid there are many people within the guild who are also against this decision, and even now it seems as if there are groans of stomach pain coming from. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the end, the choice of this kind of store in the alley for secret talks is also because (Royman) is afraid of being seen by others. If the rumors spread that [Guts] had barged directly into the "Guild Headquarters" to protest, the prestige of the guild would  immediately  fall  to  the  ground,  aggravating  the  discontent  of  adventurers and  guild  staff.  Public  opinion  will  also  become  more  intense.  If  Royman  fell </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p27"></a>because of the heavy pressure, it would  also be  a waste of time, so Finn could only choose this store that he inquired about from the mouth of the group members (elfs) of his own faction valve as the place of secret talks. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It is not difficult to imagine that this time the proposal is considered to be Royman's bitter plan. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But for Finn, he didn't want to pay attention to it at all. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Sharp, sharp eyes are not compatible with his gentle nature. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn also had trouble accepting this decision to the extent that it became so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What are war games for? What is the purpose of setting rules? It's not a 'fight' but a  'duel'.  ......  If  it's  held  in  the  form  of  a  'competition',  won't  it  prevent  the  'harm' </p>
<p class="calibre1">you're worried about? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How dare you! The adventurer's promise is not trustworthy at all! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing Finn pointed it out, Royman retorted furiously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Only at this point, he will not give in. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How many times did we believe in your words and no one died in the end? How about saying that no one was sacrificed for the minority! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if 'killing' a rival familia member is forbidden, there will still be sacrifices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the view of the guild. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Although it is a proxy war of the gods, those who are fighting are all bloodthirsty adventurers. If the opponent is a rival faction, not to mention, and driven by the fervor of the battle, the "rules of decency" and so on have long flown far away from the side of reason, right? </p>
<p class="calibre1">But in Finn's opinion, it was useless to say so now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In fact, the guild has turned a blind eye to the sacrifices made in the war games so far. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No, it is better to say that the guild is even recommending the war game itself. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One of the main reasons is that it is much better than initiating a struggle in the street, but also with the idea of resignation, that is, only by preparing the game and setting a method to judge the  winner, the karma between God and God can be finished. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However,  there  is  no  doubt  that  there  is  also  such  a  calculation  of  interest  as </p>
<p class="calibre1">'causing  faction  warlords  to  fight  against  faction  warlords  and  promoting  the ascension of adventurers'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In a sense, the war game is a place of "trial" where the rewards are greater than the sacrifices. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The war games of [Hestia's Familia] and [Apollo's Familia] are a good example. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p28"></a>Hestia's  faction  broke  the  common  prediction,  unwilling  to  become  the nourishment  of  Apollo's  faction,  seized  the  victory  and  achieved  the  leap.  In particular, Bell deserved the name of Super Rookie in that battle, emerging as a potential  adventurer.  Some  people  even  whispered  that  he  was  the  "new  hero alternate" in the community. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Royman  was  adamant  that  "the  sacred  place  where  savage  warrior  women (Amazons) kill each other all year round is not the same as the Labyrinth City! But since  this  place  is  called  "Hero  City",  it  is  only  natural  that  people  who  vow  to become heroes will clash with each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even I know, Finn! This war game is going to be the biggest one yet! The scene will be so intense that the participants will no longer be at ease, and self-control will  be  gone!  Even  the  first  level  adventurers  are  no  exception!  That's  what happens when you start a war with Freya's Familia! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cause of this riot was not good. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  memory  itself  was  tampered  with  by  the  unreasonable  『Charmed』,  and everyone in Orario was played with wantonly. The number of people who cried out that  their  dignity  had  been  insulted  and  who  could  not  restrain  their  anger  was overwhelming. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I admit that the god Freya has done something unacceptable! But because of this, many people are so excited that the status quo is out of control! [Fierce Wolf] is a good example!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately  after  the  『Charmed』  curse  was  burned  out  and  purified  by  the Goddess of Hearth (Hestia), Bert the Wolf went straight to [Freya's Familia] to take their heads. He didn't stop even after the guild issued a cease and desist order, and had to rely on Finn and the others to hold him down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Only this time, not even one ten-thousandth of the risk can appear! After that there is  the  『Black  Dragon』  crusade,  must  not  lose  the  first  level  adventurers, especially you [Loki familia] and Ottar and them ......!!! </p>
<p class="calibre1">The last remaining one of the three major adventurer commissions, the 『Black Dragon』 crusade is the responsibility and obligation of the Maze City. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It can be said that if Finn and them and Ottar and them both lose, it will not only be more difficult to realize the sad wish of the lower world, but hope itself might even collapse. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Royman was more afraid of this happening than anyone else. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If we don't enter the war, [Hestia's familia] and the allied forces will definitely lose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After hearing his statement, Finn narrowed his eyes and spoke. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p29"></a>"...... What's wrong with that? God Freya's request is only 'Bell-Cranny's change of nationality'. It's just an adventurer changing his affiliation!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Royman first closed his mouth, then responded in a low voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even if [Hestia's familia] is defeated, just looking at the point of urban battle power, there is no damage at all! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn was long overdue. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was really a long time ago that he wanted to smack his tongue deep in his lips. </p>
<p class="calibre1">--Guild's, or rather Royman's『bad fault』was shown. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Too much focus on the big picture, thus becoming inhumane. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He was not an incompetent  "guild pig" as the guild president. However, he was overly focused on the most important issues to be solved, leading him to have a tendency to neglect humanity, and even ethics. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It was the same this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In  order  not  to  damage  [Freya's  Familia],  a  powerful  urban  battle  force,  he prevented [Loki's Familia] from intervening and also intended to abandon [Hestia's Familia]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">While experiencing such a strong 'aggression', Royman chose to be on the side of </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Freya's Familia]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even though he would still be afraid of the horrors of "charm" in the future, he tried to achieve the mission of the Labyrinth City, which was to fulfill the "sad wish" of the world, by controlling his feelings with steel-like reason. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As a politician, this must be very right, and among those who worry about the lower world, this is perhaps the most sage judgment. But at the same time, it is also an unjustified reason that must not be acceptable to the world. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And  relying  on  such  things,  Finn  and  Bert  and  other  [Loki  Familias]  would  not approve of it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What a farce, Royman." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It has to be a farce, Finn." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two men's eyes were entwined with each other. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf (Royman) never tried to look away from the almost murderous gaze of the brave man (Finn). </p>
<p class="calibre1">This gesture of his vaguely reveals his own awareness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The form and rules of the ...... war game will also be decided in consultation with the God's Council. We will try to be fair so that both sides have a chance to win. I also in no way want Hestia's faction to lose. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"How many people do you think will accept your words and your actions? At least not from my group. Moreover, I don't intend to make them agree either." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p30"></a>Contrary  to  the  words  of  trying  to  stay  calm,  Finn  said  to  him  with  the  idea  of revenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately, Royman's face turned red with anger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After the full red face ............ sighed greatly again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He put on the face of an old man who was tired to the core and took out a certain item from his pocket. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Finn ...... look at this." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"「? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The one placed on the table was 『Ice Cube』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The size was smaller than a small dagger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Upon  closer  inspection,  I  realized  that  it  wasn't  an  ice  cube,  but  a  frozen  thing made of a short sword with a missing blade. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is this ......?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Royman said to Finn who had an astonished expression. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This was taken back from the 『Chikan (Talia) Ice Garden』." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">In an instant, Finn's eyes widened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He looked at Rodman's face and then looked at the frozen object on the table, and his eyes went back and forth between them once. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... So there are other grains besides her?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's just some relics though." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"What about the location of ......? </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In the gap between the 60th and 61st floors. That's all I can tell you now. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn lowered his voice subconsciously. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, after a few seconds, he asked this. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Where is the ............ 'key'?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Not found. At least Zeus and Hera didn't find it." </p>
<p class="calibre1">A moment of silence visited the store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">It gave the illusion that the world had come to a standstill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">However, after only a few moments, Royman got to the point. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If  you  agree  not  to  participate  in  the  war  games,  the  guild  will  disclose  the information of the 'Ice Garden' that we have to you. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"From the detailed route to the location of the domain, all of it will be disclosed. In that case, you should be able to attack as well." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn showed his surprise for the second time. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p31"></a>The  prum  stopped  moving  completely,  and  Royman  himself  continued  with  a strong sense of bitterness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Even Zeus and Hera can only bring back to the surface small things of this level. </p>
<p class="calibre1">But ...... you [Loki Familia] have that 『Naughty Ghost』, maybe you can find the </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Key』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Royman's words almost passed straight through the idle thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn waved away the shock of disbelief and desperately gathered information ...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">He couldn't find out Royman's intention in time and first asked. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why did you decide to disclose the information now?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"- I have to say it explicitly, you dead brain! </p>
<p class="calibre1">And once again, Royman raised his eyebrows high. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This information was original! I was going to wait for you [Loki Familia] and [Freya Familia]! I was going to tell you after the alliance between Zeus and Hera! If it's the same as the report, then the area where the "Ice Garden" is located is dangerous to that extent! But look at you guys, all you do is fight every day and you don't even try to join forces! What's more, you even want to fight now! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Thud! With a thud, Royman pounded the table. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He lifted up his body and spoke in a rambling manner, spitting out his words. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Instead of watching you both lose!!! ............ would be better to disclose the hidden information to avoid your conflict." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The large-breathing Royman sat back in his chair and concluded thus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This  is  the  deal  placed  on  both  ends  of  the  scale,  but  also  a  million  sorrowful bargaining. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Allow [Loki familia] alone to attack the two factions to work together to challenge the dangerous field. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The price is a break from the war games. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is what Royman meant. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"............" </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  the  first  time,  Finn  shut  his  mouth  at  this  compromise  point  of  the  public chairman. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the same time, this was also a counterattack by Royman against Finn. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The information hanging in front of their eyes was such that Finn and the others couldn't ignore it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At least Riveria would not remain silent. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If this matter is provoked, then she will definitely avoid this war game, even if she has a dispute with the regiment (Burt) and them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Finn ...... you must crush the 『Black Dragon』. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p32"></a>"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"After you, there is no one else. A 'heroic vessel'  of your level will never appear again." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  completion  of  the  three  major  adventurers'  commissions  is  so  severe  and heavy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf, who was over a hundred and fifty years old, said so, each sentence said with exceptional solemnity and seriousness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  time  to  crush  the  black  dragon,  the  commander  should  be  you.  ......  don't always think you're just an adventurer." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice with the intention of admonition, also contains a plea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There was a long silence between the two. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... has said it all! Don't join the war games, Finn! Understood!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finally Royman turned back to his usual appearance and stood up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After repeatedly admonishing him, he left the store in a panic. </p>


<p class="calibre1">"............ hu-" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn exhaled the air that had accumulated in his body. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He  reached  for  the  frozen  object  left  on  the  table  and  looked  at  it  for  a  while, blocking the light against the ceiling. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then leaning back in his chair, he cocked his head and made a sound. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Is this part of the goddess Freya's calculations, Hedin?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't just call me by my name, prum." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The voice that responded from behind was an icy voice. </p>
<p class="calibre1">One end of Finn's store, a little deeper. </p>
<p class="calibre1">On a seat blocked by a screen, there was an elf who was not a Royman, but a beautiful-looking elf. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This elf with long blonde hair flowing down her back and reading with a book in one hand was named Hedin Selander. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The cadre of [Freya's Familia] is also the first level adventurer of Lv. 6. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I didn't know you were a regular customer of this store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The  name  of  the  store  tells  me  that  this  store  is  related  to  elves.  As  for  you,  I guess you were recommended by the Elf of the Thousand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The name of the store was 'Visser'. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p33"></a>There was something that Finn did not know, a certain teenager was abducted by Hedin  to  this  cafe,  coincidentally,  Finn  was  also  here  to  try  out  the  "villain's proposal" to the teenager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Royman did not notice, but Hedin was already here when Finn entered the store. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf shopkeeper who knew he was there while advancing the topic - which also had the meaning of 'holding back' - was naturally cunning, and the elf shopkeeper who was still enjoying his  black  tea  with  a carefree attitude deep in the  counter even now was no better. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Freya-sama had asked for the war to be fought on the premise of defeating the entire Orario army. You can't insult that lord with such petty opinions. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin still looked at the book and spoke the unadorned truth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn, playing with the frozen object in his right hand, asked rhetorically. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Do you mean to defeat not only the allied forces of other factions, but also us?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If the opponent is you, just draw up a battle accordingly. If the opponent is you, you just need to plan the battle accordingly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The [Freya Familia] is a collection of "strong warriors (Enhelian)" who fight only for the Goddess - "individuals" with overwhelming strength who do as they please. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What  will  happen  if  such  people  cooperate  with  each  other  for  the  sake  of  the Goddess? </p>
<p class="calibre1">First of all, they would be helpless. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If  they  really  exerted  their  unifying  power  better  than  Finn's,  then  [Loki  Familia] </p>
<p class="calibre1">would not be able to win against [Freya Familia]. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The first level adventurers will be handled by the cadres (we, etc.), while the rest of the rabble will be taken care of by Haider and the others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The Cinderellas with full Bellies (André Limnir) ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In the end, although they  are companions but  still a little angry ...... as long  as there is Ottar, all kinds of premises will be subverted." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">It's true. </p>
<p class="calibre1">To put it in an extreme way, no matter what the opponent is, as long as you can't crush the fierce, it's over. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Fighting the [Freya Familia] that has the 'strongest in the city'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That's how it is. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Although Royman said those, I will still be on the side of [Hestia Familia]." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And then what?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Intervention aside, the guild doesn't prohibit 'assistance'. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"That is?" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p34"></a>"Let me grant some wisdom to my brave brethren. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Don't give me that bullshit and tough talk, dumbass." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The two men turned their backs, not even glancing at each other, only their voices moving between them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"It's  quite  satisfying  to  see  you  guys  getting  laid  by  the  guild  pigs.  It's  really refreshing." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ahhh, I really lost to him." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hedin,  who  was  turning  the  pages  of  his  book  without  moving  his  face,  spoke sarcastically, while Finn simply admitted it. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Royman was more worried than anyone else about losing his urban battle power, so he played his treasured trump card. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even if even one of the [Loki familia] participated in the war games, he would never hand over the information Finn and the others wanted. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"In this way, the possibility of expecting reinforcements is close to despair ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The [Loki Familia] intervened in order to have a 50-50 chance of winning. It is only then that the scales can finally be shaken. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The [Freya Familia] is now so powerful. </p>
<p class="calibre1">What [Hestia's familia] is about to receive is definitely a harsh and desperate battle. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Finn looked out the window. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The face of a young girl from the same Familia came to his mind, and he narrowed his blue eyes. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I wonder if she can remain calm without crying or screaming?" </p>







<p class="calibre1">"Bell Da Silver ~~~~~~~!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">The answer is no. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The brave man's wish was in vain, Liliruca Arde completely turned into a baby that only cries. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lilly ...... I'm fine now ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry I'm sorry! </p>
<p class="calibre1">[Hestia's familia] based on the "Hall of Fires". </p>
<p class="calibre1">In the living room, Bell was standing there. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p35"></a>To be correct, it was that he could only stand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily hugged Bell, buried her face in his stomach, looked up tearfully and apologized like  a  malfunctioning  autoharp  (octave  box).  She  should  be  called  crying  and begging so that Bell can not move. </p>
<p class="calibre1">In addition, not only Lili. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, Bell-kun ......! Saying those kinds of words ......! I really don't deserve to be your advisor ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Hero-sama  (you)  obviously  saved  me,  but  I  am  returning  the  favor  ....... </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haruhime ...... what exactly can I repay ...... with?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the right rear is Eina. </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the left rear is Haruhime. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The elf's hands were clutching her right hand, while her left hand was gently held by the fingers of the kneeling fox. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  apologies  coming  from  all  three  directions  were  all  filled  with  the  color  of extreme lamentation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And so heavy. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The symptoms have been so severe that the back of Bell's head could not help but gradually sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">That said, Haruhime, as well as the fact that Eina was crying gave Bell a big shock. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The  older  women  who  are  generally  the  same  as  their  sisters  are  sobbing  like children for their own sake - rather than being provoked by themselves - the impact on the teenager who is just 14 years old is too strong. So much so that his mouth was open and his guilt kept bubbling up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm  really  very  sorry,  Lord  Bell  ......  not  only  forgot  you,  but  even  pushed  you away ......! What kind of dependents are you ...... if you can't save you from your predicament! Even the earth is not forgiven!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I'm sorry, Bell. I also ...... me ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Plus plus plus. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Surrounding Bell and the three of them life and Welf and others. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Naza and Daphne, Cassandra, Ouka and Chigusa they [build the Royal Thunder familia], Aisha, and even Mord are in. In addition to the gods who rushed to the divine meeting, these were the people who had fallen to the 'charm' of the god of beauty (Freya) and pushed Bell away. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Why don't you just hit me with your fist ......" "You're just trying to alleviate the self-satisfaction of guilt ......" "Then, what should I do ......! "...... harakiri." "No, Ouka! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Mr. Bell, I'll do the harakiri! "You guys are too panicky ......" "I, I don't feel sorry for </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p36"></a>you ......! It's just that, what, I was wondering if you'd be depressed ......" and so on and so forth. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The company's main business is to provide a wide range of products and services to the public. The living room was now a place for apologies. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Ah, the whole mess." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The Kami-sama (Hestia) who lived in Bell's mind looked up at the sky and spun like a windmill. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(...... what to do.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell muttered in his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Honestly, Bell is at his wits' end. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell is not worn to the extent that he needs an apology from the other side to be comfortable. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Instead, he was a human who would feel embarrassed. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Moreover,  there  was  nothing  wrong  with  Lily  and  the  girls  this  time.  They mistakenly thought that Bell had nothing to do with them due to the 'charm', and were undoubtedly victims. However, no matter how many times he said "it doesn't matter"  "it's  not  everyone's  fault",  or  every  time  he  said  that,  the  companions' </p>
<p class="calibre1">expressions became more melancholy instead. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So Bell looked up at the ceiling, his brow furrowed, eyes closed, completely at a loss as to what to do. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you can, you want to escape from reality, and just as he was thinking that, Lily's sobs came from her stomach. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lily, Lily has sworn that she will never betray Bell-sama ......! </p>
<p class="calibre1">At the time of the first encounter, Lily approached Bell in order to earn money as well as to talk about her own revenge. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She lied and betrayed Bell, but was saved by him and became his only supporter after that. </p>
<p class="calibre1">For  her,  the  fact  of  hurting  Bell  is  the  most  unforgivable  act.  Even  death  ten thousand times is not enough to offset. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young girl sobs  with deep regret  and self-loathing,  but also attached to the sense of repentance, this cry even represents the feelings of everyone present. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Just overwhelmed, Bell looked at the still flowing tears ...... made up his mind. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He put his hands on the young girl's shoulders and knelt down, looking levelly at the pupils of the eyes that were still crying. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lilly,  listen  to  me?  I  can't  give  Lily  what  you  want  ......  that,  the  so-called punishment." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Woo, woo ...... how could ......!" </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p37"></a>Lily sobbed and looked into Bell's face, her face filled with sadness. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The tears kept pouring out from the maroon eyes, and the tiny hands could not finish wiping. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell watched such a Lily, to her, but also to Eina they said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But - there will be something much more powerful and scary than something like punishment waiting for you after this. Not just for Lily, but for me as well." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily's pupils widened greatly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">A little surprise also wafted out between Welf and them. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell arched his eyebrows and said with a slightly embarrassed smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Only by myself, there is no way to deal with the next battle. So, I want to use your power ...... to help the humiliated me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Lord Bell ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"So, just don't apologize ...... I want you to face it with me." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Please, Lilly. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Give me a hand. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing the deep red pupils of Bell's eyes that were sincerely and heartily pleading for themselves, the maroon eyes became moist again in another sense. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily wiped the still-falling tears haphazardly, sniffled loudly, and nodded her head over and over again. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Okay ......! Lily will help Bell-sama! I will support Bell-sama! With the share that hurt you, no! It's giving more than that share, and it will remain so after this!!!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... Thank you, Lily." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Seeing Lily shouted like a vow, Bell showed a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The result is that the tears of Lily, who saw this smile, broke through her pupils again, and her whole body hugged up. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The young girl's arms around Bell, her face buried in his neck like a tight bite, Bell tenderly patted her back, while looking around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"And  Welf,  Miss  Mikoto,  Miss  Haruhime  ......  and  Miss  Eina  you,  also  please. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Please give me a hand." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Then, he said snidely to Welf and the others, whose eyes were wide open. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I've often caused trouble for everyone before, right? So, this is ...... 'cleared'." </p>
<p class="calibre1">--I probably have more debts, and you guys are at a disadvantage. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell scratched his cheek and said so. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Immediately after, Welf and the others also finally found a smile. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... The chief said so. Let's do it, everyone." </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p38"></a>"As you wish ....... The ones who are going to help Lord Bell must be the ones who are here! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Haruhime also wants to repay your kindness! Even if it costs her life!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Welf smiled like a brother and ordered to reply seriously, and Haruhime wiped the corners of her eyes with her fingers and made a vow. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He finally changed from "Bell of Freya's Familia" to "Bell of Hestia's Familia". </p>
<p class="calibre1">At that moment, Bell thought. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell  ......  I'll  make  a  bunch  of  reply  pills  afterwards  ......  I'll  try  to  challenge  the Allspice that has been unsuccessful before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Thank you, Miss Naza! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I will also sleep until I see a nice precognitive dream, even if it's bitter! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Please don't force yourself, Cassandra-san! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell-kun! I will also secretly convey to you all the information that the guild has obtained! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"This is a bit ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">By Bell's call, Naza and the girls finally got rid of the thorny cage made of guilt, and they also raised their heads and agreed to help Bell. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone also said 'and I', 'and I', the scene was getting hotter and hotter, just as Bell's forehead began to sweat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The door to the hall made a loud noise and was opened. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The actual fact is that you will be able to get a lot more than just a couple of days. </p>
<p class="calibre1">I'm sure it's impossible to convince Loki and the girls! </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hestia said loudly as if she was saying 'I can't take it anymore' and entered the living room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  returned  from  the  divine  meeting  with  a  strange  "meow-ah!  She  threw  the papers she got back into the air and threw herself into the couch. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"The Loki Familia is forbidden to participate in the war ....... That's right ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Picking  up  a  parchment  that  had  landed  on  the  floor,  Bell  who  had  probably scanned it did not hide his concern. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He knew that ever since the war games were set to take place, Hestia had been attending the divine meetings every day, trying to win conditions favorable to his side. He also knew that the trend of things was becoming stranger and stranger. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Freya does not attend the divine meeting, but still maintains the attitude that she will accept whatever form of victory or defeat (rules) ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"But the difference in battle power itself is too great. The fact that Loki and the girls are not participating has caused other [familia members] who were interested to watch. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p39"></a>After  Hestia,  Miach  and  Takemikazuchi  also  came  to  the  sitting  room.  When Hephaestus finally entered the room, the familia members all had a nervous look on their faces. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Can we just have a competition to see which side eats more? ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Who would accept a winner based on something like this? ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Ouka  responded  to  Daphne's  words  with  a  headache,  but  he  could  actually understand that this was really what he wanted to say in this situation. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The name of [Freya's Familia] is so loud that to fight with them means despair. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"There were people within the guild who were disgusted by the fact that the [Loki Familia] was not participating in the war. However, the upper echelon of the guild seems to be very afraid that both Loki-Freya faction valves will lose both sides ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">As Eina finished speaking, silence descended in the sitting room. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Why take up the war games. </p>
<p class="calibre1">No one would blame Bell as well as Hestia. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Everyone understood that without going through this battle, the karma with [Freya's familia] could not be ended, and the commotion would not calm down. </p>
<p class="calibre1">After leaving Bell, Lily, who had finally calmed down, put on the expression of a counselor (mind) and looked at Welf's face. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Welf-sama ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"I know ...... after all, I just finished with Bell, I will build『Crozzo's magic sword』. </p>
<p class="calibre1">There will be time to fight and build a bunch out." </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Welf, Welf, but that's ......" </p>
<p class="calibre1">"If it's "Welf's (my) magic sword", it will inevitably depend on the user's ability. Even if  it  will  break,  you  can  only  use  『Crozzo's  magic  sword』  to  bring  out  the firepower that can defeat opponents stronger than us. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Feeling Bell's gaze with concern, Welf shook his head. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The "Welf's Magic Sword" created in the "Expedition" had the self-destruct element removed, and its effect and firepower - except for the maker (Welf) himself - would be determined by the user's ability value. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Even the current Lv. 2 Lilly to use, but only to play the corresponding Lv. 2 power. </p>
<p class="calibre1">If you want instant fire power that can burn the enemy out, then『Crozzo's Magic Sword』is essential. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He doesn't mind imitating the hometown kingdom (Rakia) - the [Ares Familia] that prides itself on the "myth of invincibility". </p>
<p class="calibre1">Welf,  who  had  been  jealous  of  the  magic  sword  of  the  Familia  (Crozzo),  had already made this realization. </p>
<p class="calibre1"><a id="p40"></a>Everyone present, including him, realized that to defeat the opponent, they had to do whatever it took. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"......  to  formulate  the  battle.  Be  cautious,  be  careful,  and  think  of  all  possible means. Otherwise, we won't be able to pull the odds in our favor." </p>
<p class="calibre1">Lily's nervous voice fell, and immediately after. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Aisha, who had not joined the army of thankfulness to the teenager and had been silent, said. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Instead of bowing down and apologizing to Bell Cranel, why don't you go and beat up Freya's group? That's what I always thought. It's none of my business whether the Loki familia is there or not. ...... Aren't you guys like that?" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing these provocative, Belligerent words of the Amazon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The adventurers were the only ones who expressed their approval this time. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Yes, Miss Aisha! My daughter will try, too, to beat, beat, beat, beat them away! </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Sir  Bell  has  been  fighting  alone  until  now.  Then,  this  time  it's  the  turn  of  the underlings to give everything!" </p>
<p class="calibre1">Haruhime and Mikoto also said one after another. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Hearing  the  voices  of  their  two  childhood  friends,  Ouka  and  Chigusa  also responded with smiles and said "Wow! "Hmm!" . </p>
<p class="calibre1">With Aisha's motivation, the gloomy atmosphere was swept away. Eventually the group, mainly Lily, began to discuss the war games. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"...... is great." </p>
<p class="calibre1">The corners of Bell's mouth curled up as he looked at the vibrant and willful Lily girls from afar. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This is the joy and reassuring smile after seeing Lilly and the girls get rid of their guilt. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The first thing you need to do is to get a good look. </p>
<p class="calibre1">He quietly left Lily and the others, approached the window and found that the sun had given way to the moon. </p>
<p class="calibre1">(What is that person ...... I'm doing it right now.) </p>
<p class="calibre1">Floating  in  the  distant  sky  were  the  things  that  had  happened  in  the </p>
<p class="calibre1">『Wilderness』 that had spent a false time, and the 『She』 that had shown many expressions that she had never seen before. </p>
<p class="calibre1">Bell looked up at the dreamy moon and whispered the name of a girl in an inaudible voice. </p>



<p class="calibre1"><a id="p41"></a> </p>



<p class="calibre1">The pale night was also like a dim canal. </p>
<p class="calibre1">The twinkling stars are the swaying water. </p>
<p class="calibre1">And the missing moon is like a phoenix-tailed boat. </p>
<p class="calibre1">This boat emits a dreamy glow through the gap of pale clouds. </p>
<p class="calibre1">As if looking for someone in the boat who is far away from the sky, the moonlight sighs and sighs that there is no one around. </p>
<p class="calibre1">So, who is it that you are looking for? </p>
<p class="calibre1">The goddess wanted to ask so, and then gave up the idea. </p>
<p class="calibre1">She  fished  her  overly  comical  self  out  of  the  sea  of  sentimentality  and  simply murmured the name of the teenager. </p>
<p class="calibre1">"Bell ......" </p>
