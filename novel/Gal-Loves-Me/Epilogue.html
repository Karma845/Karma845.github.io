<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>With December approaching, it was entering the period where the season would enter winter in full swing.</p>



<p>As days were going by hecticly, this was one of those unimportant, trivial incidents amidst such passing.</p>



<p>While spending their time chilling around in the apartment, Shino noticed a half-opened closet.</p>



<p>“Hey, this closet isn’t closed properly, so can I close it? Were you trying to do something or stuff like that?”</p>



<p>“Eh? Aah, I just forgot to close that.”</p>



<p>“Geez, you better properly close it. …Hmm?”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“There’s something with pretty wrapping… I wonder what this is…”</p>



<p>Sandai perked up at that thing Shino curiously picked up. That wrapped object was the Christmas present for Shino.</p>



<p>He couldn’t just go, ‘I will give it anyway, so it doesn&#8217;t really matter if it’s now.’ This kind of thing got meaning because it would be given on the day in question.</p>



<p>Sandai snatched the Christmas present from Shino in a panic and immediately hid it behind his back.</p>



<p>“Not his one!”</p>



<p>“Hey…”</p>



<p>“No means no!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Is it something you’ve gotta hide that desperately? As far as the wrapping goes, it’s not even anything that weird, right?”</p>



<p>“Not now. Not for now…” Sandai said while looking down, only for Shino to put her index finger on her chin and tilt her head.</p>



<p>With a rather keen intuition at times like this, Shino delightfully smiled, seemingly to have arrived at the correct conclusion rather quickly.</p>



<p>“<em>For now</em>… is it. Hmmm.”</p>



<p>“You might be curious, but just forget this. No matter what you say or what you do to me, this is the only one thing I won’t hand over right now.”</p>



<p>“Sure.”</p>



<p>“Heh…?” Sandai let out a freak-ish voice at the suddenly sensible Shino.</p>



<p>In response, “I don’t know what’s inside, but I will look forward to it till Christmas.” His extremely cute gyaru girlfriend winked with the tip of her tongue out.</p>
