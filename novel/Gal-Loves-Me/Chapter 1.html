<h3>Chapter 1 – Fate is More Normal Than Expected, Huh?</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>Thinking that it would be harsh for her to go to her part-time job in a dirty uniform, Sandai lent her his clothes. However, there was a difference in height and in physique of a man and a woman, so of course, the size didn’t fit, and it was very loose-fitting when Shino put them on.</p>



<p>“That felt great~.”</p>



<p>“Glad to hear that. Hear, I’ll give you a paper bag, too.”</p>



<p>“Hmm? Paper bag?”</p>



<p>“The paper bag is pretty big so you can put your uniform there. If you get an express dry cleaning on the way to your part-time, you can pick it up when you head back.”</p>



<p>“What great hospitality~.”</p>



<p>“You think so? Alright, now get out.” Sandai pointed at the entrance.</p>



<p>He’d done all he could do, so now this was all wrapped up—or it was supposed to. For some reason, the beautiful gyaru in front of him looked unamused and didn’t try to get moving.</p>



<p>“Aren’t you kinda cold? Ah, I get it! You must be thinking what to do if your parents see this situation now, don’t you? I mean, I guess you’d be asked what you were doing bringing a girl in. I didn’t see them, but could they be out at work or shopping, and like they&#8217;re gonna be home soon?”</p>



<p>Perhaps trying to fool around and tease him, Shino seemed to think that she’d hit the sore spot of a high school male student with her comments about parents… though, that didn’t work against Sandai at all. After all, his parents were overseas for work reasons.</p>



<p>“That teasing won’t work on me,” Sandai shrugged his shoulders and claimed its ineffectiveness. “I live alone after all.”</p>



<p>Shino instantly got sullen and pouted. However, she seemed to have thought of another way to tease a little while later. “&#8230;That’s so awesome living alone. But then, you know, could there be naught books all over the place? I mean, no parents’ eyes on you, so you can collect as much as you want.”</p>



<p>Like guys his age, Sandai certainly possessed that kind of thing as well, but he was keeping as much of it as possible as data stored in his PC.</p>



<p>However, it wasn’t like he got zero physical goods hidden either. Sandai’s composed attitude underwent a one-eighty, and he got plainly flustered by Shino’s house searching.</p>



<p>“You idiot! Stop!”</p>



<p>“What’s with the panicking? Don’t tell me…”</p>



<p>“You’ll find tons of mangas, but you won’t find any naughty books no matter how hard you try. You’ll find nothing. Forget about that, just get out already.”</p>



<p>“Aww c’mon, don’t get so uptight like that.”</p>



<p>“What do you mean ‘aww.’ Trying to be cute or something?”</p>



<p>“I can try, you know? Rawr~ rawr~.”</p>



<p>“Shut it! C’mon get moving! Shoo shoo!”</p>



<p>Having kicked Shino outside while pushing the paper bag where her uniform tossed inside to her, Sandai shut the front door quicker than the eye could see and sat down on the spot.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Normally you don’t just go fishing through someone’s home. She really is a race living in a different world; both our common senses and values are too different. I totally would never go rummaging through someone’s home. Oh well, from tomorrow we&#8217;ll no longer be involved with each other anyway.”</p>



<p>Sandai talked to himself about a kind of societal order or truth.</p>



<p>Even if an irregular event occurs in the world, it will not become the norm and will always try to return to its original form.</p>



<p>It is such a thing.</p>



<p>Though, there are exceptions to everything.</p>



<p>Sandai didn’t notice it—that he himself had become that exception.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>Next morning, Sandai was taking out his naughty books for trash disposal.</p>



<p>The reason was yesterday’s Shino’s failed attempt at house fishing.</p>



<p>Although Sandai thought that the chance of encountering a similar crisis would be extremely low, he couldn’t completely dismiss the really slim chance that it might happen, and the next thing he knew, he’d been tying up the naughy books.</p>



<p>He’d love to sell it for money if possible, but his status as a high school student stood as a barrier. He would have to show identification to sell them, and his school would definitely be contacted at that time. That would make it a very troublesome thing.</p>



<p>As he watched the garbage pickup place through the window, he saw the garbage truck arriving and two workers tossing the books into the back of the truck.</p>



<p>Although it was certainly Sandai’s own volition to give up the physical goods, it was strangely sad for him to see the naughty books tied up with strings disappearing.</p>



<p>The naughty images and books stored in his PC remained untouched, so it wasn’t even unnecessary to feel forlorn, though…</p>



<p>Well in any case, now Sandai would be back again to lead his ordinary, uneventful, and lonely as ever school life—</p>



<p>—Or supposed to.</p>



<p>Sandai himself was completely not expecting this, and he couldn’t go back to his usual school life. The cause was Shino.</p>



<p>Before the start of the first period, Shino suddenly went to talk to Sandai.</p>



<p>“Here’s the clothes I borrowed when I got to your home and took a shower yesterday. Also my part-time is at a cafe, and I’m giving you some confections made there, too!” Shino said loudly and brazenly, and placed his clothes and what appeared to be thank-you confections on Sandai’s desk.</p>



<p>Setting aside the fact that she had meant to give the clothes, the surroundings were even more shocked at Shino’s words and actions than Sandai, the concerned party.</p>



<p>The relationship with the opposite sex of Shino, a leading beauty, was a topic of interest to students regardless of their school year, class, or gender, and Sandai was suddenly the man of hour, as ‘the man brought that Shino to his home and in addition lent her a shower.’</p>



<p>The instantly sparked rumors didn’t stay in the classroom, but quickly spread throughout the school. The loner Sandai couldn’t even get the opportunity to make an explanation.</p>



<p>He would be watched wherever he went, and whispers could endlessly be heard.</p>



<p>“I stand out in a troublesome way… Why… do I have to go through this… Come on, please wake up quickly if it’s a bad dream…”</p>



<p>It was only after school ended, and Sandai rushed home to his apartment and locked the front door that he was finally able to catch a breath.</p>



<p>While frowning at the surging exhaustion, Sandai first went to shove the returned clothes into the closet and put them away.</p>



<p>But then a small cherry-blossom colored memo fluttered down from the gap in the clothes.</p>





<p>‘It’s my contact info! I’m especially giving it to you!’</p>




<p>A message app ID and phone number were written on the memo along with such a text.</p>



<p>“The heck is this… Is this that thing where you call and the scary big brother answers? Or could she be trying to drag me into MLM or something?”</p>



<p><em>I’m not gonna fall for that kind of trap</em>, Sandai crumpled up the memo, tossed it into the trash can, and headed to his desk sighing. Forgetting all that for now, he started studying to kill time until the start of late-night anime.</p>



<p>There was a way of killing time with manga or light novels, which he would often do as well, but the pace at which Sandai would go consume them was rather fast, and he currently got zero backlog.</p>



<p>That was how Sandai spent his time: studying at that kind of time. Studying was a casual way to kill time for Sandai, which was close to daily routine or habit.</p>



<p>He would have the choice to head to town were he to have a friend, but Sandai was a loner. He got no friends to hang out with.</p>



<p>—Dull youth.</p>



<p>Seen from the outside, no doubt Sandai’s daily life would appear so, and one could say indeed it was. However, in exchange for such bitter loneliness, he’d also gained results in the so-called ‘grades.’ In fact, he constantly ranked first in his school year since enrollment.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Come to think of it, I was given confections, huh. The shop&#8217;s name is written on the bag, so I guess this really doesn’t seem to be a trap or something.”</p>



<p>He opened the confection bag to check the content, and saw that it contained amarettis. Since there was no weird smell, and didn’t seem like it would be extremely spicy when eaten, Sandai picked one up and threw it into his mouth.</p>



<p>It was delish with just-right sweetness. No matter how much of a gyaru she was, it seemed she really didn’t intend to tease people with food.</p>



<p>“&#8230;This is just plain good.”</p>



<p>He was reaching for it while continuing with studying, and the amarettis were all gone before long.</p>



<p><em>…I just hope I won’t get any weird attention tomorrow</em>, Sandai thought while crawling into the bed, after having finished studying by late at night, and finished watching the anime he’d been waiting for.</p>



<p>…Though, in fact, it wouldn&#8217;t go as he wished. Unfortunately, no change the next day—no, if anything, it got worse.</p>




<p><em>“So I hear Yuizaki-san going to a guy’s home and taking a shower…”</em></p>



<p><em>“A woman taking a shower at a man’s home… it’s gotta be screwing, no? Totally screwing, right? I wanna screw Yuizaki, too!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Looks like that man called Fujiwara or something is a gloomy loner. What’s Yuizaki even doing with a guy like that? I’m definitely a better man here.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Maybe she’s been brainwashed with hypnotism…? That or her weakness. I wonder if I can also get Yuizaki to be mine if I can get hold of her weaknesses.”</em></p>






<p>The side irresponsibly creating rumors may be having a good time, but the side being rumored about was extremely stressed. Sandai was gradually driven into the corner mentally, the content of the lessons was entering his ear and out the other, and when walking, he was losing his sense of balance, and his steps were becoming wobbly.</p>



<p>Though, he couldn’t shut people’s mouths. He could only endure. Sandai decided to curl up like a turtle in his seat and wait for the time to pass.</p>



<p>But then he got poked in the back with the tip of a mechanical pencil. Sandai looked back wondering what was up, and found a smiling Shino there.</p>



<p>Speaking of which, sitting behind him was this gyaru.</p>



<p><em>What’s she doing… I see, I get it. If she gets involved with me, I’d be getting even more cornered by the people around. She must want to have fun watching that. That kinda stuff is fun to watch from the sidelines.</em></p>



<p>Sandai now wanted to make a complaint, but that was precisely the reaction Shino was seeking, so Sandai decided to ignore her, not wanting to worsen the situation.</p>



<p>“Poke poke, poke.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Your response?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>If he were to give no reaction, Shino would most likely lose interest before long. Gyarus were supposed to have such a personality.</p>



<p>Thus the thing he ought to do was sit quietly and wait for the time to pass. <em>Come to think of it, </em>Sandai thought, <em>the surroundings are also gradually calming down like, ‘Maybe there was some kind of misunderstanding,’ and everything will be settled</em>.</p>



<p>Sandai’s plan was largely fruitful.</p>



<p>Around lunch time, Shino’s poking came to a stop, and she began to indulge in conversations with her own friends.</p>



<p>Although the looks from around were still showing no singing of fading, surely it would be just now. He was feeling somewhat comforted in thinking that it would stop before long.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Probably it’s still gonna take time, but it looks like my daily life can somehow return.”</p>



<p>Sandai took lunch alone at the cafeteria, “Phew,” let out a sigh of relief, returned to the classroom, and put his hand on the door—but stopped short when he heard the voices of Shino and her friends talking from inside.</p>




<p><em>“Say, Shino, is it true you went to Fujiwara’s home?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Eh? It’s true, you know? I borrowed a shower and some clothes, too.”</em></p>



<p><em>“For real? Is one like that your taste? Fujiwara’s just a loner, though?”</em></p>





<p>Knowing that he was being bad-mouthed, Sandai’s temple began to pop veins and twitch.</p>



<p>However,</p>




<p><em>“It’s not about taste or anything… It’s just, that I thought he’s a kind guy, I guess.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Kind?”</em></p>



<p><em>“You know, the reason I went to Fujiwara’s home was because I screwed up and plunged my foot into the ditch. I also got part-time, so when I was thinking I’ve gotta do something about it, he said, ‘Wanna come to my home?’ I could sense there were no ulterior motives at all, so… so I followed him. And then he didn’t do anything weird as I expected. See? Fujiwara’s kind, right?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I feel like it’s simply more of being a wuss than kind, though… but well, I guess you’re also very sensitive to that kinda thing.”</em></p>



<p><em>“And you also notice ulterior motives right away, and often reject them rather harshly by their responses and attitudes even before talking to them.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Shino… could it be that you’ve never dated a man even once?”</em></p>



<p><em>“T-That’s right… ‘cause I’m not good with guys…”</em></p>



<p><em>“A maiden does exist in reality. This is so precious.”</em></p>



<p><em>Maybe… Yuizaki is not that bad of a girl… I guess</em>, he thought, and his anger subsided right after.</p>



<p>Sandai silently left the door and went to gaze out the window in the corridor.</p>



<p>Clear blue skies stretched out endlessly, and the sound of cicadas and the lingering summer heat around his skin gradually seeped into his body.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>



<p>Come afternoon, Shino resumed her poking attacks.</p>



<p>As for the reason for doing it again… Sandai wasn’t really sure, but anyway, his hostility towards Shino was fading, and he was wavering whether this time he should respond or not.</p>



<p>However, it didn’t mean that he got a change of heart enough to proactively try to get involved with her just because his hostility was fading, so he still continued the plan to ignore her. In terms of original standing within school, it was a natural relationship where neither side would get involved in the first place, and he also got a strong feeling that it should return to such a normal condition.</p>



<p>Though, surprisingly without even getting sick of it the next time, Shino continued to poke Sanda’s back the next day and the day after that when she saw an opening, contrary to the thought of Sandai.</p>



<p>About the time marks seemed to start forming on his back, Sandai finally looked back, judging that she wouldn’t seem to stop unless he faced her and talked.</p>



<p>Then he found Shino making a lonely-looking face. Sandai also couldn’t help but at a loss for words at the expression he hadn’t expected.</p>



<p>“W-What’s with that face…”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’m waiting, you know?”</p>



<p>“Waiting? For what?”</p>



<p>“Hmph.” Shino then suddenly looked away. “Even though I put a memo in there…”</p>



<p>The mutter from Shino was so tiny that Sandai couldn’t hear it clearly.</p>



<p>However, it was clear that it was some kind of words expressing a change of feelings, and Shino stopped the poking attack ever since, no longer trying to get involved.</p>



<p>And then as if to match that, the gazes and interests towards Sandai from the surroundings was beginning to calm down, albeit little by little.</p>



<p>Although it had gone slightly differently from expected, Sandai should rightfully be happy as this was the end he had hoped for… that said, welling up in Sandai’s heart wasn’t joy, but a fuzzy, vague feeling.</p>



<p>That never leaving, unpleasant feeling clinging to his heart continued to remain even after a day and two had passed.</p>



<p>Why was Shino making a lonely-looking face? Although he certainly had gone all the way with giving zero reactions, he hadn’t said any cruel things, or threatened her or anything…</p>



<p>When Sandai noticed it, he had only been thinking about it around the clock, and today as well, he continued to mull over it until after school.</p>



<p>He understood that he couldn’t continue being like this. It would come up as a hindrance to his daily life if prolonged, so he would have to do well to regulate his own heart.</p>



<p>The solution Sandai took after much worrying was a very simple one: ‘forget it’ and ‘pretend to have never seen it.’</p>



<p>“&#8230;Alright.”</p>



<p>Sandai slapped both his own cheeks, and attempted to go about his business as usual while being aware of his subconsciousness.</p>



<p>After going back to his apartment, taking an early bath, checking new releases of mangas and light novels, he began studying.</p>



<p>Time went by in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>Next thing he knew it was a little after nine at night.</p>



<p>In order to take some break, Sandai went to make a coffee and turned on the TV. It was either dramas or news programs being played at around this time, but he had no particular interest in drama so he chose the news program.</p>





<p>‘A typhoon is rapidly approaching. The Meteorological Agency has issued a warning that the typhoon will hit in two hours and that people should refrain from going outside unnecessarily. Also, in response to the typhoon, the train service has been suspended for the day with the last train departing earlier at 20:28.’</p>





<p>He went to check the outside through the window, and saw strong pouring of rain and raging wind. He hadn’t noticed it as he’d been immersed in studying, but the typhoon seemed to be approaching unnoticed to him.</p>



<p>“Looks like I can’t go outside… Well, not like I have nothing to do outside, though,” Sandai murmured, and the doorbell rang. “&#8230;Who is it? Home delivery or something? Nah nope, I don&#8217;t remember having asked for package night delivery… Actually, they wouldn’t have come in the midst of all this mess about a typhoon coming even if I’d asked for one. Don’t tell me it’s not new religion recruitment, is it? And going like ‘This typhoon is the wrath god~’.”</p>



<p>Sandai turned on the intercom’s speaking function and video, and then froze. He found Shino there.</p>





<p>“So-Sorry. I was done with my part-time and about to go home, but then the train stopped because of the typhoon. S-So, can I spend the night today?”</p>





<p>He understood it wasn’t package night delivery nor new religion recruitment. Though, what would be the correct way to respond to this?</p>



<p>Bewildered, nevertheless, unable to leave Shino alone sneezing, going “Achoo!” Sandai hurried down to the entrance.</p>



<p>“Yuizaki…”</p>



<p>“Yahoo.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’ll prepare the bath, so come on in for now.”</p>



<p>“Eh? You sure?”</p>



<p>“You’re just gonna catch a cold like that.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Thanks. I appreciate it.”</p>



<p>Having pulled Shino into his home, Sandai refilled the hot water in the bathroom, and tossed his night clothes to change into and a bath towel into the changing room and had Shino hold it.</p>



<p>“Wawah! …Geez~ you’re so rough. You’ve gotta be more gentlemanly or you won’t be popular, you know?”</p>



<p>“It’s not like I live my life to get popular,” Sandai said, mixed with a sigh.</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/QM0GW8z/csapkmg.jpg" alt="csapkmg" border="0"></a>


<p>Shino puffed up her cheeks and pouted. “‘Cause you’re always just so cold… Aah no, not that…” Shino was mumbling something. “You really don’t seem to be thinking weird things, so I guess I got interested, too.”</p>



<p>Though, it was too tiny of a voice for Sandai to hear, so with his hand placed on his ear, “Yeah? You just mumbled something where, what’s wrong?” he asked back. “You’ve got some complaint or something?”</p>



<p>“Not really.” Shino stuck out her tongue and turned away.</p>



<p><em>I’m curious about what she’s saying, but it feels like I wouldn’t get an answer even if I were to forcefully get her to tell me. Probably not saying anything important anyway</em>, Sandai gave up doing it, and closed the door to the changing room.</p>



<p>Shinos’s silhouette visible through the changing room’s frosted glass let out a sigh and began to undress. As the black shadow put its hand on the underwear, Sandai suddenly thought, <em>Come to think of it… mangas and light novels often have this kind of situation where it would develop into a lucky pervert peeping</em>.</p>



<p>Given that a lot of naughty stuff was stored in his PC, it didn’t mean Sanda got no interest in perverted developments—though, as expected, there is a clear line between reality and creative works.</p>



<p>In fiction, girls would easily forgive perverseness, but it isn’t the case in reality. That is an obvious thing, or rather, he got a high amount of fear of causing emotional scars. Shino in particular—that risk seemed likely on her.</p>



<p>Shino had told her friends: ‘I’m not good with guys.’</p>



<p>It was just something Sandai had happened to hear, but Sanda remembered it.</p>



<p>Shino’s tone of voice hadn’t sounded like telling a lie, so it was probably true, and besides, Sandai had something popped up in his mind.</p>



<p>At the very beginning—when talking to Shino who had been down in the ditch, she’d taken a slightly curt attitude. Only after he actually had lent her a shower had her demeanor softened a bit.</p>



<p>If Sandai didn’t like Shino, then a harassment suicide attack disguised as an incident would be a brief amusement, but it wasn’t as though he didn’t like Shino that much. The ignoring was purely because he thought there should be segregation.</p>



<p>So Sandai just went back to the living room and quietly waited for Shino to finish bathing.</p>



<p>The second hand on the wall clock cycled around, and the minute hand moved.</p>



<p>Again and again that went on repeat, moving the clock’s hands forward, 10 minutes, 20 minutes, 30 minutes.</p>



<p>Different from Sandai who would take a quick bath, it seemed it was a long bath for Shino.</p>



<p>“Well, I also hear girls’ baths are longer and all.”</p>



<p>Sandai gazed outside through the window, and fixedly watched the even stronger downpour and gale. He checked the clock again after some time had passed and found that it was almost one hour.</p>



<p>Shortly after, Shino came out along with the trail of the oversized night clothes’ hem.</p>



<p>“Hauuh~.”</p>



<p>Shino’s face looked pleasantly happy, perhaps because her body had warmed up.</p>



<p>She was awfully carefree despite throwing his conditions and feelings out of order in many ways—though, it was nothing more than a matter of Sandai’s personal way of thinking and perceiving things, and Shino wasn’t doing anything wrong.</p>



<p>Sandai could also come to an objective view or so, thus without even expressively exposing what was in his mind, he normally spoke to Shino who was squashing the sofa’s cushion with her butt. “&#8230;You were in the bath for pretty long there.”</p>



<p>“Girls just take time.”</p>



<p>“I’d be done with it in ten minutes here.”</p>



<p>“So quick… Are guys like that?”</p>



<p>“I’ve got no friends so I don’t know, but probably other guys are also like me… By the way, I’ve got one thing I wanna ask.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Something you wanna ask? What is it?”</p>



<p>“I think you said it will take an hour by train to get home, didn’t you? I know it’s not a walking home distance, but…”</p>



<p>“But?”</p>



<p>“Is it really okay for you to stay here? I’m a man, and there’s no one but me in here. Are they parents who allow that kind of thing?”</p>



<p>“Ah… I might get scolded if they found out, but… well it’s fine. I’ve already told them I’m staying at a female friend’s house.”</p>



<p>Sandai was left with his jaw dropped. Glancing at such Sandai, Shino chuckled.</p>



<p>“I’m happy you’re worried… but it’s really fine, you know? I’ve never lied like this before, so I’m pretty trusted by my parents. No worries.”</p>



<p>“So it means the first lie? I’ve got a feeling it’s not fine, though…”</p>



<p>“You know, from time to time you are getting back with funny replies.”</p>



<p>“I’m just saying things at random. More importantly, wouldn’t you normally think of staying at a female friend’s house instead of going out of your way to come to my place and all? You could find some friends living around here if you try, right? Around here is close to school, and I think there are a lot of them deciding their high school with a reason like ‘cuz the commute to school is easy.’”</p>



<p>“There’s certainly girls living nearby, but… suddenly saying ‘let me say’ is gonna inconvenience them, right?”</p>



<p>“So you’re saying it’s fine to inconvenience me.”</p>



<p>“Tha-That’s not what I… It’s just, here was the place that suddenly popped up in my mind.”</p>



<p>Shino made puppy eyes, and poked her fingers together, poke poke.</p>



<p>Sandai was taken aback by that fully apparent apologetic gesture, and lost all motivation to ask in detail about the reason for visiting.</p>



<p>“So, well… You chose my place, and that was already in the past, and there’s also no point saying this and that.”</p>



<p>“Right, right.”</p>



<p>“I sure do envy you for being able to act as you felt, Yuizaki.”</p>



<p>“It sure is getting me embarrassed when you compliment me.”</p>



<p>“It’s not like I’m complimenting you… So, what are you gonna do with your uniform? It will smell if you let it dry out straight from soaking up the rain, right?”</p>



<p>“Aah, about that… with this typhoon… dry cleaner’s probably won’t open, even the one operating 24-hours a day, right?”</p>



<p>“I guess it’s gonna be closed temporarily.”</p>



<p>“Thought so. Can’t help it. Guess I’m doing it myself. Lend me laundry detergent and a bucket if you have any.”</p>



<p>Sandai made a dumb, “Eh?” sound at Shino’s request.</p>



<p><em>…A gyaru who doesn’t seem to have a clue about housework doing laundry? Actually, can uniforms be washed by yourself in the first place?</em></p>



<p>Although he couldn’t hide his many confusions, for now he lent them to her as requested as he got a detergent and a bucket.</p>



<p>And then Shino rolled up the sleeves and the hem of the nightclothes and began to deftly hand-wash her uniform in the bathroom.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’ve got a washing machine, you know?”</p>



<p>“This one gotta be hand-washed. Have you seen the label on the uniform?”</p>



<p>“Label?”</p>



<p>“Look, here.” Shino showed him the inner part of her uniform in the middle of washing. There was a label with a picture of what looked like a hand dipped in a bucket. “This illustration means that you should hand-wash it when you do it yourself, so no washing machine.”</p>



<p>“I’ve never checked this stuff before… Actually, you’re a gyaru, but you know this domestic stuff, huh?”</p>



<p>“That’s just prejudice that gyarus don’t know houseworks~”</p>



<p>That was correct. It is certainly simply a prejudice to arbitrarily decide to categorize people and assume they are like so and so.</p>



<p>“&#8230;My bad for assuming.”</p>



<p>When clearly in the wrong like this, the more excuses made, the deeper the damage will be. It is better to apologize upright as the wound will be superficial.</p>


<p>Shino grinned at the meekly apologizing Sandai.</p>



<p>“Whoah you apologized? Could this be my win?”</p>



<p>“I don’t think it’s about winning or losing… but right, let’s say it’s your win.”</p>



<p>“Fufuh… But well, the impression you’ve got isn’t actually that wrong, though. There are lots of girls who can’t do houseworks as a whole like this, you know? I guess you can figure it out pretty easily if you look at their fingernails.”</p>



<p>“Nails…?”</p>



<p>“My nails. They’re normal, right?” Shino’s nails were indeed normal, but not quite getting its connection with houseworks, Sandai tilted his head. “Have you ever seen a girl with flashy nails? Like drawing flowers, sparkles, and stuff.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Now that you mentioned it, I think some are like that.”</p>



<p>“Manicures do look pretty, but like the color or lamé might get transferred when cooking or doing laundry. That’s why I guess girls who do housework tend to be more reserved. Well I guess there are also girls who do it without caring, and not having manicures doesn’t necessarily mean they can’t do housework… but it’s the tendency, I think?”</p>



<p>“I see.” Sandai nodded as he could understand Shino’s explanation.</p>



<p>“So… My home doesn’t have a lot of money, and I help out with houseworks including taking care of my little sister when I have time, and I also have a part-time job so that I can have some money to use freely on my own, but my workplace is a cafe with foods and drinks, so I can’t and don’t do anything with my nails.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Hearing that kind of story sure is changing my impression of you.”</p>



<p>“Oh really?”</p>



<p>“You’re starting to look like a girl who got it together.”</p>



<p>“Thanks! When I’m talking to you, somehow it&#8217;s becoming fun for me. It’s strange,” said Shino— the next moment, a prickling pain ran through Sandai’s chest.</p>



<p>Sandai suddenly felt somewhat embarrassed for having arbitrarily distanced himself from her, thinking not interacting was only natural in their relationship.</p>



<p>Shino must have wanted to have a conversation exactly like this now; in short, she had just wanted to interact with him normally.</p>



<p>He’d been refusing such a simple thing.</p>



<p>Once he realized it, he felt guilty.</p>



<p>“&#8230;What’s wrong, Fujiwara? You look like you’re in a lot of pain. Your belly hurts or something?”</p>



<p>“Nah, nothing like that. Right, I’ll help with the washing. Please let me do it, too.”</p>



<p>That was an offer that, in Sandai’s own way, was also meant as atonement.</p>



<p>However, Shino’s face turned bright red, and she waved both her hands exaggeratedly telling him no.</p>



<p>“It-It’s fine, you don’t need to help. It’s all right!”</p>



<p>“C’mon, don’t be so reserved. Just maybe, but hand-washing takes quite a bit of strength, right? As a man I can be of—”</p>



<p>“—I’m saying it’s fine!” Shino roared. Sandai took a step back with a start. He hadn’t expected to be refused so adamantly.</p>



<p>“T-The heck… So you don’t like me so much…?”</p>



<p>“I don’t… mean that.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“I mean…I’m also washing my… wear, too.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I can’t hear you clearly, though.”</p>



<p>“I-I was also washing underwear along with it, so… no…”</p>



<p>On a closer look at the inside of the bucket, he could see something reddish under the bubbles. The uniform wasn’t that color, so in other words: underwear.</p>



<p>Speaking of which, Shino had been drenched when she’d shown up. Of course her underwear would’ve been wet, too.</p>



<p>Not realizing that a little thinking would’ve been enough to figure it out, Sandai’s face turned as red as Shino’s in embarrassment at having seen her underwear, albeit accidentally.</p>



<p>“I-I see… So you’ve been washing underwear, too…”</p>



<p>“Yep… I was washing it…”</p>



<p>Unable to fully endure the strange, awfully hard to describe mood, Sandai turned around, hurriedly left to scurry away into the living room, sat on the sofa, and distracted himself by watching the continuation of the typhoon coverage coming from the TV.</p>





<p>‘&#8230;The typhoon has made landfall as it remains to move slowly, and the rainstorm is expected to continue until early morning. The Meteorological Agency and the electric power company in charge has issued advice to take extra precaution against power outages and so forth as lightning strikes have been confirmed in some areas.’</p>





<p>Listening to the news presenter giving information about the current typhoon was gradually making his bashfulness fading. When hearing a serious talk, his excitement was surprisingly subsiding.</p>



<p>However, while Sandai had calmed down, Shino was still blushing when she came back after finishing washing a little while later.</p>



<p>“Done with the washing?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yeah.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;This is gonna be an after-the-fact report, but I found a drying machine so I used it. Sorry.”</p>



<p>“Drying machine? Oh sure, you can just use it.”</p>



<p>“Thanks… I mean, it’s amazing to have a drying machine at home. That’s gotta be expensive, right?”</p>



<p>“I wonder about that. I don’t know if it’s expensive or cheap. It was something that had been fitted out since the beginning. More importantly, what did you do with the uniform after drying it?”</p>



<p>“I straightened it out so it doesn’t lose its shape, and then hung it there.” Shino pointed towards a slightly protruding edge in the corner of the room. It was hung there with the hanger smoothly hooked to it.</p>



<p>There was an indoor drying space, so there was no need to hang it in such a place, however…</p>



<p>“You don’t have to hang it—”</p>



<p>And there Sandai noticed Shino was hanging her head down and bashfully pouting her lips, and guessed the reason why she’d gone out of her way to hang it in the corner.</p>



<p>Because there was also underwear, Shino had purposefully chosen a place where it wouldn’t come into Sandai’s view as much as possible. That’s how it was.</p>



<p>“—Actually, right, that might be the best place instead. It’s unexpectedly near the AC. It’s possible it could still be a little wet no matter how much you used the drying machine. Machines aren’t flawless either sometimes. But if you hang it there and put the AC to dehumidify, it will be reassuring in case of something happening.”</p>



<p>Sandai made use of his tact to change the subject and operated the AC. Then Shino patted her chest looking relieved.</p>



<p>Not that he was especially conscious of it, but the conversation stopped there. Only the sound coming from the TV continued to echo in the silent room.</p>



<p>The one who couldn’t stand this somewhat suffocating mood first was Shino. “We’ve got nothing to do and all,” she muttered softly. “Don’t you have anything to play with?”</p>



<p>Sandai lifted an eyebrow and responded. “&#8230;I hear you, but it sure is sudden.”</p>



<p>“Anything is fine really. Please.”</p>



<p>“Guess I’ve got no choice… I’m gonna go look for something so just wait.”</p>



<p>Sandai went to rummage through the wardrobe and closet, and found an old game console and games from his childhood. He was looking at it completely covered with dust, and somehow some unpleasant memories were coming back.</p>



<p>It was something he had bought with a vague feeling of wanting to play it together with friends someday, however… he couldn’t make friends.</p>



<p>Since he had always been alone and got no one to play with, he couldn’t get so into video games, and had got more and more into late-night animes, mangas, light novels and such where the content could be enjoyed even alone.</p>



<p>Well, it’s also a waste of time to look back on your own sad past. The past is, after all, the past. No other choice but to come to terms with it, and Sandai did so.</p>



<p>For the time being, Sandai went back to Shino with the game console and a board party video game of his choosing that seemed to be playable with two people.</p>



<p>“I’ve found a video game here.”</p>



<p>“Nice! Then let’s get right to it.”</p>



<p>“For the record, this is a pretty old game console, okay? It doesn’t have pretty visual images or smooth motions like newer ones. Don’t complain, alright?”</p>



<p>“I won’t. So let’s go.”</p>



<p>Sandai was slightly anxious whether she really wouldn’t make a complaint, but that was a groundless fear. When they actually started up the game and began playing, Shino was enjoying it just fine.</p>



<p>The game board continued to progress along with time, and they were approaching the midpoint.</p>



<p>“Hold on, Fujiwara… don’t use the item to steal that you just picked, okay? Looks like it’s stealing at random, but I don’t want to get to be the target.”</p>



<p>“Then just when will it be okay for me to use this item?”</p>



<p>“C’mon, you can just not use it at all.”</p>



<p>“Eeeh…?”</p>



<p>“By the way, aren’t the NPCs kinda too tough?”</p>



<p>“It’s set to the weakest setting just in case, but right, somehow they sure are tough, huh.”</p>



<p>The setting was set to be ‘Easy’ so that even two beginners could enjoy the game, but for some reason, the NPCs were blasting away and taking over the top spot. The NPCs were always in first place even in the mini-games played along the way.</p>



<p>“C’mon, let’s restart from the beginning.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Right. Then let’s restart.”</p>



<p>Since it certainly wouldn’t be fun to continue as it was, Sandai decided to restart from the beginning like Shino was telling him.</p>



<p>Then, this time, the NPCs became dramatically weaker.</p>



<p>The earlier one probably had been a bug or something, and when the game progressed to the midpoint again, Shino was first place this time. And Sandai was in third place and normal placement.</p>



<p>“We’re about to enter the second half, and I’m already so far ahead. I guess this is my win~.”</p>



<p>“Next is my turn, huh…”</p>



<p>“Isn&#8217;t it a bit tough for a comeback from there? How unfortunate of you~.”</p>



<p>Despite being riled up by the triumphant Shino, Sandai calmly rolled the dice and picked up a strange box on the tile he’d advanced to. He pressed ‘Yes’ on the ‘Do you want to open it?’ popup, and an item that would allow fellow players to swap places appeared.</p>



<p>“Whoa this one is…”</p>



<p>He checked on Shino with a glance, and her composed expression was making a 180. She seemed to be shuddering at the unforeseen item; going “Awawawa” with both hands on her mouth.</p>



<p>“Y-You won’t use it… right?”</p>



<p>“Ah… Well, I don’t really care about winning or losing anyway.”</p>



<p>“Thank god…”</p>



<p>“Though, now that I’ve got it it&#8217;s a waste to not use it, isn’t it? You’re telling me not to use the item, but y’know, it’s no fun for me if I just accept it as is.” With that said, Sandai pressed the button and used the item. The result: he swapped places with Shino and jumped to first place.</p>



<p>“Y-You liar~!”</p>



<p>“I never lied.”</p>



<p>“But you said you wouldn’t use it! You don’t care about winning or losing, don’t you?”</p>



<p>“I certainly said ‘I don’t care about winning or losing,’ but I never said ‘I won’t use it,’ not even once. Don’t just wilfully go make any weird interpretation.”</p>



<p>Now on the verge of tears, Shino was hitting his shoulder, pomf pomf. Sandai couldn’t help but smile at the sight of her being so serious about a mere game.</p>



<p>And then—</p>



<p>A lightning struck nearby in the next instant, and all electricity was cut. Both Sandai and Shino opened their eyes wide in surprise at the sudden event.</p>



<p>“A lightning struck… and it got all dark.”</p>



<p>“Must be a power outage.”</p>



<p>“I just hope it gets restored soon.”</p>



<p>“I do think ‘soon’ is far-fetched. The storm was crazy, and I suppose it wouldn’t be easy to do repair work.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Even though we were in the middle of a game.”</p>



<p>They were only able to see faintly in the total darkness, nevertheless, Sandai could still somehow tell that Shino was puffing up her cheeks.</p>



<p>Shino seemed to want to play a bit longer, but a power outage was an accident beyond his control. He would have to have her give up.</p>



<p>“It was getting pretty late anyway, and it’s time to call it a day even if there wasn’t a power outage. It’s time for most people to hit the bed.”</p>



<p>“I guess it can’t be helped. Aye aye, sir! And so… where do I sleep?”</p>



<p>“You can go ahead and use the bed in my room.”</p>



<p>Sandai didn’t have any reluctance to lend his own room to Shino, a girl. Luckily, he had disposed of all of the physical naughty books, and all he got in his room was the bed, study materials, and then mangas and light novels after all.</p>



<p>And as for the naughty stuff stored in his PC, the PC itself couldn’t be used in the first place because of the power outage. Even if it was normal times, it would always be locked.</p>



<p>To sum it up: as long as no one was not standing behind him while he was in the middle of appreciating lewd stuff, he was usually in a position to be able to stand tall.</p>


				
<p>“I appreciate you lending me your own room, but… where are you going to sleep?”</p>



<p>“I can just go sleep on the sofa or the floor.”</p>



<p>“There’s no bed or futon in other rooms?”</p>



<p>“There used to be one in the room my parents were using, but they would rarely come back, and when they do, they’d just drop by for a bit and leave again later that day. Well, it got tossed out because they said they weren’t using it. And now it’s totally become a storage room. For the record, no need to strangely worry about me, alright? If I let a girl sleep randomly somewhere and I sleep soundly in my bed, I’m already nothing but a brute at that point, and I just don’t want to be like that. Think of it so that I won’t turn into a brute, and quietly sleep on the bed,” said Sandai matter-of-factly, and Shino chuckled.</p>



<p>“It’s not like I’m trying to, though. If I were that type, I wouldn’t have wilfully chosen your place as my refuge, or asked you to get something to play with, come on.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I guess that’s true, too.”</p>



<p>“But well, thanks, for saying it in a way that’s making it easy for my mind… And so, where is your room?”</p>



<p>“Over there.”</p>



<p>“Come on, you said it’s over there but I can’t see anything since it’s pitch black… You go take my hand and lead the way.”</p>



<p>Shino held Sandai’s hand and intertwined their fingers.</p>



<p>Sandai’s heart spontaneously quickened at the feel of the gyaru’s small, slender, soft, and slightly cold hand.</p>



<p>“You’ve got… a cold hand, huh.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Do you know what kind of a person someone with cold hands is? It’s a superstition that’s been told to exist since forever.”</p>



<p>Sandai forgot where he’d heard it, but he had also heard the superstition Shino mentioned. Someone with cold hands has a warm or kind heart, something of the sort.</p>



<p>Sandai was of the belief that superstition was just superstition, though, only now did he feel he could believe it.</p>



<p>The reason was simple.</p>



<p>Sandai was taking a rather cold attitude towards Shino. However, without even minding that, Shino was interacting with him normally.</p>



<p>Shino was kind, and her hand was cold, so it was also making him feel he could believe it.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Thank you, Yuizaki.”</p>



<p>“Wha-What’s wrong, so suddenly?”</p>



<p>“You really are kind.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Praising me won’t get you anything, you know?”</p>



<p>“It’s not like I said it because I wanted something. I just gave it a try, saying what I felt. I’ve been pretty cold, yet you were interacting with me normally. That’s why it made me want to say thank you… I’m sure you are the nicest woman in the world, Yuizaki,” Sandai said as if to let it all out.</p>



<p>Then Shino gulped down a saliva, and suddenly turned silent without uttering even a single word thereafter.</p>



<p>Despite feeling anxious whether she might’ve gotten put off, Sandai had no regret. After all, precisely because he had always been a loner all his life, he knew by feel that a moment in which he could convey what he’d like to convey was precious.</p>



<p>So despite the sense of accomplishment, there was not a hint of regret.</p>



<p>Though, Sandai had no idea how Shino took the words he’d just said. Shino didn’t make any gesture trying to shake his hand off, so he knew that at least she didn’t consider it to be creepy, but…</p>



<p>Unfortunately unable to see her expression due to the pitch-darkness, there was an overwhelming lack of materials to make a judgment.</p>



<p>However, by simply knowing that it wasn’t considered unpleasant, Sandai didn’t even think of trying to know more.</p>



<p>If the feelings of gratitude were fully accepted, there would be no need to know further.</p>



<p>When they arrived in the bedroom, Shino, still silent, fumbled around to confirm the shape of the bed, lay on her side, and curled up stirringly.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Good night,” Sandai muttered to Shino and quietly left the room.</p>



<p>But immediately after, he could hear the sound of arms and legs flailing around coming from the room.</p>



<p>“Wha-What?”</p>



<p>Having nervously peeked into the room, Sandai only now did notice that he got his phone in his pocket, and went to turn on its light to see inside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“I heard some kind of noise just now,” he tried to talk to Shino for the time being, “did something happen?” but Shino remained wrapped up in bed and didn’t move a muscle.</p>



<p>“Hellooo.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“No reply… Already asleep, huh. Was the noise just now my imagination? …Oh well, more importantly.” Sandai softly closed the room’s door, and checked the time as he turned off his phone’s light.</p>



<p>It was 00:20—about time for his hobby of late-night anime to start.</p>



<p>He would like to watch if he could, but it appeared to be impossible in the current situation with the power still out.</p>



<p>But there was still time until the start of the broadcast, so there was still the possibility that the power would turn back on before then.</p>



<p>Sandai decided to wait for now.</p>



<p>However, the light was still out even when it was the time for it to start.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’m more towards wanting to watch anime on its first broadcast, but the situation is what it is, so I guess it can’t be helped. I guess I’ll watch it online later.”</p>



<p>Sandai lay on the sofa and closed his eyes. The sofa was surprisingly comfy to sleep in, and he slept like a baby.</p>



<p>Next morning.</p>



<p>Sandai couldn’t wake up with his own power.</p>



<p>What finally made him wake up was a somewhat good smell of a cooking tickling his nostrils and getting hit in the forehead again and again with a ladle at a good tempo.</p>



<p>“Wake uuuup.”</p>



<p>“My forehead… my forehead is… huh, Yuizaki?”</p>



<p>“You finally woke up~.”</p>



<p>“I did… but I kinda want to check with you… I don’t want to believe it, but have you been hitting my forehead with that ladle in your hand this whole time?”</p>



<p>“Don’t you think it’s bad that you don’t wake up?”</p>



<p>“So you have…”</p>



<p>“I was doing it without trying to hurt you, so you can rest assured.”</p>



<p>“That’s not the prob… By the way, I’ve been smelling something good since earlier, though.” Sandai looked at the table as he twitched his nose, and saw a simple but proper breakfast of cooked rice, grilled fish, miso soup, and pickled vegetables. “This is…”</p>



<p>“Breakfast. I made it.”</p>



<p>“You did? Even though there’s no ingredients at home to make a proper meal? There was nothing in the fridge, right?”</p>



<p>“Ah, there’s certainly nothing, but…”</p>



<p>Sandai practically wouldn’t cook for himself, relying instead on supermarket or convenience store’s packed meals. Not even one ingredient was home, except for rice and seasonings he was keeping just in case, so where in the world did the fish, pickled vegetables, and miso soup come from?</p>



<p>Shino smiled wryly at Sanda tilting his head in puzzlement.</p>



<p>“I went out a bit to buy ingredients. The typhoon has passed and all, so I thought maybe the supermarket which will be open since early morning will be open, so I tried to go there, and it’s open… I got a place to stay, so at least this much, okay?”</p>



<p>She seemed to mean it as thanks. Though, Sandai hadn’t given Shino a place to stay because he wanted her to do something like this.</p>



<p>However, it would certainly be hard to tell her to back out now that the dish had been completed. Shino also had taken the trouble to make it, so it would surely turn unpleasant.</p>



<p>Left with no other choice, Sandai in the end decided to accept it… but before that.</p>



<p>Shino said she had gone out to buy the ingredients, which meant she had spent money; Sandai was feeling inexplicably bad about that. Taking his wallet, he approached Shino—</p>



<p>“Ouch.”</p>



<p>—Tap tap, and his forehead got hit with the ladle.</p>



<p>“Why did you take out your wallet?”</p>



<p>“No I mean, it cost money to buy the ingredients, right?”</p>



<p>“It didn’t cost me that much. It’s not even a thousand yen.”</p>



<p>“Maybe for the hassle of going out shopping and making it…”</p>



<p>“The supermarket is just close by, and I wasn’t even making a single elaborate dish~. It’s just stuff I can quickly whip out. You can’t honestly say ‘thank you’ like you did last night?”</p>



<p>As Sandai was racking his brain to somehow give the money, Shino’s expression gradually turned stern. She was clearly unhappy.</p>



<p>It wasn’t like Sandai was looking for a fight either, so he would have to back down now that she had taken such an attitude. He got something in mind, but he stopped the useless resistance and expressed his thanks. “&#8230;Thank you.”</p>



<p>“That’s good!”</p>



<p>Seeing Shino smiling happily and cheerfully, Sandai had his breath taken away. After all, it was exceedingly pretty.</p>



<p>Shino was originally one of the most beautiful girls, so it was obvious she would be pretty, but Sandai had never been conscious of it nor taken a proper look.</p>



<p>Beautiful double eyelid on a well-ordered contour without a single waste. A nose that wasn’t too high nor too low, fair skin that was giving off a refreshing feeling. The soft and fluffy pigtail hair as well, the end was slightly dyed in cherry blossom color, which enhanced the fluff and cuteness.</p>



<p>It made him realize that she was truly a genuine beautiful girl who would seem to overshadow lousy idols or actresses.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong? You’re staring at me like that.”</p>



<p>“It’s nothing…”</p>



<p>As to be expected, he wasn’t able to say that he got captivated.</p>



<p>“You&#8217;re weird. Actually, what kind of food are you usually eating?”</p>



<p>“What kind… I’m buying packed meals. Cooking for myself is bothersome so I don’t do it.”</p>



<p>“A no-good-man-like statement came out.”</p>



<p>“Whatever you say.”</p>



<p>Sandai faced away, took a seat, and ate the breakfast silently. In response, Shino sighed, seeming to want to say: Good grief.</p>



<p>Having finished breakfast while squinting their eyes once in while at the morning sun shining in through the gap in the curtains, they did the dishes, and decided to go to school together as they were going to the same school anyway.</p>



<p>“&#8230;This is my first time going to school together with a guy.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s also my first time going to school together with a girl, huh.”</p>



<p>As they were advancing, avoiding puddles of water created by the typhoon, Shino suddenly took a step ahead of him and turned around.</p>



<p>“Speaking of which, here.” Shino took out a sheet of memo she fished through her bag, and shoved it into Sandai’s chest pocket with a gusto.</p>



<p>“Wha-What…?”</p>



<p>“I hurriedly wrote it before you woke up, so it might be a little hard to read, but… it’s a memo with my contact address.”</p>



<p>“Contact address?”</p>



<p>“Yep. I also slipped in a memo when I returned your clothes, but I thought it maybe got lost somewhere. That’s why I’m giving you another one here.”</p>



<p>Then Sandai remembered; about the memo in his returned clothes he had assumed to be a prank, which he had crumpled up and thrown away.</p>



<p>Although he understood it now, that hadn’t been a prank. In that memo he had gotten from Shino had really been written with her contact address.</p>



<p>“Don’t lose it this time, okay? I’ll be waiting to hear from you.”</p>



<p>In the world colored by the light reflected by puddles of water, Shino raised the corners of her mouth and smiled, and Sandai’s cheeks heated up at that sight.</p>



<p>“Huh? Aren’t your face kinda getting red?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s not.”</p>



<p>“Nuh-uh, it’s read, y’know?”</p>



<p>“It’s not red. Doesn’t it seem that way because of the light reflection or optical illusion or angle or something?”</p>



<p>“I don’t think so, though~.”</p>



<p>Repeating such questions and answers, Sandai felt a strange sensation he had never experienced before: something somewhat sweet and sour.</p>



<p>His heart was fluffy.</p>



<p>What made Sandai’s strangely unsteady heart able to calm down was because and thanks to the noisy gazes pointed at them from the surrounding after arriving at school and passing through the gate.</p>



<p>The fact that they were going to school together seemed to have given a renewed energy to the rumors and suspicions, and naturally, the whisperings from the surrounding were reaching his ears even without him trying to listen to it.</p>



<p>It was a rather irritating kind of attention to be honest, but Sandai wasn’t particularly perturbed as he had already experienced such a situation once before.</p>





<p><em>“Look, over there.</em>”</p>



<p><em>“I knew it, those two…</em>”</p>



<p><em>“Going lovey-dovey aren’t they.</em>”</p>



<p><em>“Does this mean that guy is… Yuizaki’s boyfriend? …I guess that’s how it is since they’re together in the morning… A loner like that is Yuizaki’s… The world is so ridiculous.</em>”</p>



<p><em>“I do think it’s hypnoticism. Yuizaki is being brainwashed. I mean, how else could it be possible?</em>”</p>



<p><em>“What do you mean hypnoticism. Snap back to reality, you.</em>”</p>




<p><em>…They sure are saying whatever they please again</em>.</p>



<p>Sandai sighed, and beside him, Shino tilted her head and repeatedly blinked her eyes. It was a gesture that seemed to want to say: I don’t know why I’m being looked at.</p>



<p>“Somehow.. I feel like I&#8217;m being looked at more than usual. Something similar also happened a little while ago, but I wonder why.”</p>



<p>She was feigning ignorance… not. Shino didn’t seem to be self-aware just how much of a conspicuous existence she was.</p>



<p>No, more precisely, she was deliberately not aware of it, or something along those lines perhaps. She got such a feel somehow.</p>



<p>When humans are stressed, they would shut out and avoid information, regardless of consciously or unconsciously. Sandai got a relatively high stress tolerance and wouldn’t block out information to the same extreme as Shino, but that was a kind of brashness.</p>



<p>“For the time being… I guess it might be better if we stay away from each other at school.”</p>



<p>Sandai thought that that would be the very best way to lighten the burden on Shino even a little. The degree of the effectiveness wasn’t definite, but it should be better than doing nothing.</p>



<p>Though, Shino didn’t seem to take fancy to Sandai&#8217;s proposal and got sullen.</p>



<p>“Why? Why is it better to stay away?”</p>



<p>“Why, you ask… You don’t get it? Anyway, forget about me at school, just get along with the rest of them. Aren’t you always talking to other girls and stuff in the classroom?”</p>



<p>“You’re suddenly getting cold…”</p>



<p>“We can now talk outside of school if we want to. I’ve got your contact address after all. It’s not like it’s necessary to forcibly associate at school. …I’ll contact you tonight. I promise.”</p>



<p>The words Sandai muttered with the flow were, inadvertently, the first words in which Sandai, out of his own intent, declared to have a relationship with Shino.</p>



<p>Sandai’s heart was shaking; more than the tender fresh leaves beginning to sprout. Shino seemed to have noticed that change and opened her eyes wide in surprise.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I heard your words just now loud and clear, and have memorized it, okay? Totally contact me in exchange for not approaching at school, okay? It’s a promise you said yourself, so you absolutely can’t break it, okay?”</p>



<p>“I-I got it.”</p>
