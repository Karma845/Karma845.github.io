<h3>Chapter 3 – Got a Makeover and Introduced, Huh?</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>The date had further passed and finally entered the second half of October.</p>



<p>Every day had been going well.</p>



<p>Today the same as always, Sandai had warmly welcomed Shino coming to his place after her part-time job, placed her on his lap, and was playing a console game together.</p>



<p>“Aah, I’m gonna lose!”</p>



<p>“Today’s gonna be my wi—”</p>



<p>“—Then how about this!” Shino kissed him, seeming to try to cause a physical disturbance.</p>



<p>Having a sweet smell of strawberry gently tickling his nasal cavity, Sandai unintentionally dropped the controller in his hands, got the tables turned in that gap and lost.</p>



<p>“I won!”</p>



<p>“Hey… out of the blue like that is not fair.”</p>



<p>“It’s not not fair~.”</p>



<p>Shino stretched as if to say she was in a good mood, and began to get ready to go home because it would almost be time for her train.</p>



<p>With the street at night being risky, Sandai decided to walk Shino to the station, though he’d always done so. Then on the way there, Shino pressed her index finger on her lips, and went, “Hmmm,” as she tilted her head.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“It just hit me, but… somehow it’s just like being subtly noticed.”</p>



<p>“Being noticed?”</p>



<p>“You know, us, we’re trying not to talk at school, right?”</p>



<p>“Sure we are.”</p>



<p>“But it’s like, there are people who kinda have guessed our relationship. Or rather, somehow it’s like, there are those who seem like that.”</p>



<p>It seemed some students were beginning to vaguely suspect their relationship, perhaps the limits of keeping their relationship under wraps began to show.</p>



<p>They’d been taking various care to avoid it getting found out, but even so, both their eyes would also be filled with passion were they to make eye contacts when passing by each other.</p>



<p>That truly would just be an instant, but from the beginning Shino had been a beautiful girl who would constantly attract attention, so she would be watched by all sorts of students for every single move of her. There was a sizable number of folks who would not miss even a mere instant of that, so to say.</p>



<p>“So, if possible, I… sure would love not to hide it anymore. And I so wanna tell people that I’m dating you, Sandai. Telling them you’re the boyfriend I’m proud of.”</p>



<p>Sandai got just a little embarrassed from being told he was the boyfriend she was proud of. He was happy to hear that from her, but he was feeling awkward.</p>



<p>“Is that.. a no?”</p>



<p>Shino was poking her index fingers together while pouting. When it came to being asked like this…</p>



<p>Well, all that aside, to hide the relationship was somehow just a continuation of the decision made at the time he hadn’t thought they would be dating, and now that they were actually lovers, various things should certainly change as well.</p>



<p>Disclosing the relationship would also be a choice with a big advantage to Sandai. After all, it would become a strong deterrent against men secretly aiming for Shino.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Well, I guess there’s no need to forcibly hide our relationship anymore.”</p>



<p>“Then—”</p>



<p>“—Right, then let’s go as you say. That said, like suddenly showing a boyfriend-girlfriend relationship in the classroom seems like it would cause chaos at many levels, so I’d say it’s gotta be done gradually.”</p>



<p>“Gradually… Then should I tell my friends that we’re dating and have them spread the word?”</p>



<p>“My bad, I have no friends, so it looks like I’ve got to rely on you, Shino.”</p>



<p>“No need to apologize. In the first place the one who said not wanting to hide it was me, remember?”</p>



<p>The talk thus came to a conclusion, and it was decided to gradually spread their boyfriend-girlfriend relationship.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>



<p>And now, after school the next day.</p>



<p>As Sandai was about to go home while looking at the back of Shino going straight to her part-time job from a distance, he was called out by a group of five flashy gyaru students.</p>



<p>Even Sandai knew of these five. They should be Shino’s friends, and he would often see them chatting happily between breaks.</p>



<p>“Hey Fujiwara, got a minute? So we heard from Shino herself, and you two are dating? It vaguely feels like that, but like, it’s just plain surprising, though.”</p>



<p>As planned, Shino had immediately told her friends about the fact of her relationship with Sandai, but still, the gyarus somehow seemed stiff.</p>



<p><em>Could they be thinking that I’m not a good fit for Shino?</em> And so Sandai spontaneously put himself on guard with his bag as a shield, only for the gyarus to sigh all at once.</p>



<p>“&#8230;You don’t gotta be on guard like a stray cat like that. It’s not like we’re trying to find fault at you or anything. Shino thought you’re a good man and chose you, so not gonna make any complaints about that. It’s not about any of that, there’s just a bit of something we’re troubled with, and like, we sure love to have your cooperation.”</p>



<p>They seemed to have come to ask for a favor, and not to make a complaint. Sandai lowered his bag feeling anticlimactic.</p>



<p>“So there’s like a ‘gathering’ or like ‘dinner party’ and stuff like that, the kind where there’s also guys coming… and we’ve also been inviting Shino to one since ages ago, but she’s just always declining, you see. Especially lately it’s just totally hopeless. If she’s gotten a boyfriend, then that’s understandable, though. But I’m telling you it’s totally different with or without Shino. The Shino Boost is really just that amazing.”</p>



<p>“Yep yep. Not just guys from other schools, but college students sure would also come in droves. If Shino’s name is mentioned.”</p>



<p>“You maybe don’t know, Fujiwara, but Shino is actually famous even outside of school. She even got invited to be a model or an idol and the like. Well, Shino refused, though.”</p>



<p>It was the first time for Sandai to hear about invitations from the show business, but she was that much of a beautiful girl, so there was nothing weird about it.</p>



<p>“I… I see.”</p>



<p>“With that reaction I guess you really didn’t know just how amazing Shino is, huh… I wonder if that kinda thing looked good to Shino instead.”</p>



<p>“Prob.”</p>



<p>“Shino and Fujiwara’s beginning of romance’s not important right now, so let’s just put it aside for the time being. Errr, so I’m gonna be straight, we’re talking about making you come to the dinner party with us. Like, we thought maybe Shino will come if we do, get me?”</p>



<p>“Well, we sure would love to have at least one more Shino Boost. It just really makes a difference in the guys joining in… So please.”</p>



<p>Then the five gyarus went to lower their heads to Sandai in turn.</p>



<p>Their attitude was conveying that it was a rather serious favor. That said, it was also something he wouldn’t want to accept as her boyfriend, frankly.</p>



<p>“I get what you&#8217;re all trying to say, but Shino’s not good with men, so I think it’s just not right to bring her out to a place like that, alright? Besides, like going there together with her boyfriend, the men you called sure are gonna get mad as well. In other words, just quietly give—”</p>



<p>“—Wait. It’s mutually benefitting, you know?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Huh?”</p>



<p>“First, we’re gonna be able to naturally tell the guys, ‘Shino actually got a BF, so no-no. That’s why choose from among us, ‘kay?’ And so, if you show off your presence in front of the guys like, ‘I’m her boyfriend here,’ it’s gonna become a repellent for them not to get close to Shino, right? This is the so-called mutually benefitting.”</p>



<p>Sandai’s mind began to waver slightly, thinking that that way of thinking was a blind spot and that it might have a point. Then, as if to say this was their chance, the gyarus pressed in.</p>



<p>“I think Shino will be happy with the result, you know? You girls think so too, right?”</p>



<p>“I sure do. If in front of other guys you go ‘Don’t you dare lay your hand on my girl…’ like a chad, that’s totally heart throbbing, right?”</p>



<p>“And Shino looks pretty crazy about you, Fujiwara, so that sure is gonna KO her if you do something like that. You might just make her not want to leave you her whole life.”</p>



<p>“Totes~. And she gonna be like, ‘All I can see is you now!’.”</p>



<p>“And it’s gonna be a chance to see Shino’s happiness-to-the-max face. There’s no choice but to get on board, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>Being rallied up, Sanda was somewhat becoming inclined as well. It began to seem like something that could only benefit him.</p>



<p>“By the way… wanna give Fujiwara some makeover? If we’re bringing him, you want him looking a bit cooler, right? He’s just too plain.”</p>



<p>That was probably an opinion that just popped out all of sudden, but the gyarus’ ears twitched, and they showed their approval, going, “Agree!” one by one, and it got approved unanimously in just several seconds.</p>



<p>Sandai was bewildered as he hadn’t expected the conversation to go in a direction like that, but first he got both his arms caught in a tangle by two of the gyarus, and then got pushed in the back with a gusto by the remaining three, turning it into a very difficult situation to flee from.</p>



<p>“Then let’s get going.”</p>



<p>“Right, while the iron still hot~.”</p>



<p>“Ho-Hold on! This makeover or whatever stuff is just too sudden, I—”</p>



<p>Although Sandai was putting up a resistance somehow, “If you get cooler~ …I think Shino will also be happy, though?” he got whispered with such sweet words close to his ear, and his strength suddenly was wearing thin.</p>



<p>Sandai also knew by feeling that Shino liked the way he was, not giving any demands or anything regarding his usual look and such.</p>



<p>However, while that may be true, it didn’t necessarily mean there was no dissatisfaction at all. There was also the possibility of her thinking, ‘I wish he could get a little cooler.’</p>



<p>Such an anxiety smoldering in the furthest back of Sandai’s mind was tickled. Unlike Shino, these gyarus seemed to be greatly used to the opposite sex, and seemed to know what to say to sway a man’s heart.</p>



<p>“We’ll pay for it, so no worries.”</p>



<p>“Well, that’s just fair, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“Can’t be helped.”</p>



<p>“And we’re the ones who decided for it, right~.”</p>



<p>“Right~.”</p>



<p>Now that such a deal was arranged, Sandai found himself nodding his head slowly.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>Now then, the first place Sandai was brought to was a beauty parlor.</p>



<p>Although so far Sandai hadn’t particularly cared about his hairstyle, he thought that it should be within the normal scope, but… this seemed to be a no-no. The gyarus had looked up for beauty parlors on their phones, begun to indiscriminately call them to see if a same day appointment was possible, and chosen a place that seemed to be fashionable from among the hits.</p>



<p>Although feeling timid to be in a fashionable beauty parlor which he had never come to one before, Sandai sat down in the chair he was led to. The hairdresser to be in charge of him came shortly, but that cheeks of hers cramped up after seeing the bizarre sight of a plain-looking boy surrounded by five gyarus.</p>



<p>“H-How do you want to look today? If you haven’t decided on anything in particular, you can choose one from this…”</p>



<p>But, despite being clearly bewildered, the hairdresser never did mention the gyarus around him. Seemingly good in reading the mood perhaps due to her line of work, she ignored them and gave Sandai the hairstyle catalog despite feeling bothered.</p>



<p>For the time being, Sandai opened the catalog to read it, but…</p>



<p>“Dibs!”</p>



<p>“Wha, hey!”</p>



<p>“Alright alright, just wait there.”</p>



<p>“Right~, we’ll choose for you.”</p>



<p>…The catalog was snatched away by the gyarus, apparently not going to give the right to choose the hairstyle to Sandai.</p>



<p>“M-My opinion is…”</p>



<p>“You can’t know what hairstyle gonna look good on yourself, you know?”</p>



<p>“Leave it to us!”</p>



<p>“She said it, this is our turn to shine.”</p>



<p>The gyarus rattled on and began to have a discussion while ignoring Sandai, the concerned party who would have his hairstyle changed.</p>



<p>“Nnn what’s gonna be good, I wonder? How about something like this manly undercut with shaved sides?”</p>



<p>“Nope~. Fujiwara is better with this prince bob cut than with that. It’s cuter and all.”</p>



<p>“Eeh? I sure think it’s better with this foreign guy-ish shaved head than with stuff like that.”</p>



<p>“Ugh, there it is, the baldy lover. I mean, you might be all happy with baldness, but Shino sure is gonna get mad. Probably. …I think this is good. Don’t you think this mullet with perm is good? I sure do love stuff like this.”</p>



<p>“Nuh-uh, nothing old fashioned.”</p>



<p>“Eeh, then which is good?”</p>



<p>“Let’s see… Isn’t middle parted hair that got both fashion and charm good? Don’t know if it’s gonna look good, but the proof is in the pudding like they say.”</p>



<p>Somehow it seemed turning into him being made into a toy.</p>



<p>Having a hunch that this would go to an unpleasant outcome at this rate, Sandai appealed with his eyes telling them, ‘Please stop making the decision for fun.’</p>



<p>The gyarus surprisingly noticed Sandai’s complaint quickly, but they didn’t take any attitude of feeling sorry at all.</p>



<p>“Well, I guess the most important thing is whether Shino will be happy with it.”</p>



<p>“I guess in the end it comes to that.”</p>



<p>“Nn.”</p>



<p>“No objection.”</p>



<p>“Sorry for saying as we please, Fujiwara.”</p>



<p>It was a light reflection and apology that didn’t seem to come from the heart at all, but it was all good since at least having his hairstyle changed for a strange reason had been avoided.</p>



<p>“But Shino’s taste… taste… what she likes, I wonder? Anyone know?”</p>



<p>“Dunno. I mean, Shino just always runs away when it comes to talking about what kinda man she likes, right?”</p>



<p>“Shino tends to run away from talking about men, so who knows what she likes. I think she can’t just keep on saying she’s not good with men this, not good with men that forever, though… Wait, she got a boyfriend, so I wonder if her not-goodness with men also decreased. Well anyway, she chose someone like Fujiwara, so doesn’t she like plain-feel then? If we ask for a fresh and cool look, then we can have him get finished up to look good.”</p>



<p>“The heck, that’s very so-so.”</p>



<p>“I mean we can only ask for that, right? Earlier we just got glared at by Fujiwara, too. If it were my boyfriend, I’m gonna turn him into a guinea pig no questions asked, though.”</p>



<p>“I guess that’s true… actually, isn’t saying if it’s your own boyfriend it’s okay to make him a guinea pig just the same awful thinking? I feel bad for the men who will date you, actually, don’t you think that’s why men won&#8217;t approach you?”</p>



<p>“Can you stop with the super fast straight ball?”</p>



<p>“It’s a direct hit LOL.”</p>



<p>“Asking for a fight, aren&#8217;t cha?”</p>



<p>“Alright, okay okay, slow down slow down, we’re almost leaving Fujiwara behind again. I’m going back to topic, okay? So, about the fresh and cool look, well, I’ve got a feeling it’s got a high chance of satisfying Shino. So you okay with that too, Fujiwara?”</p>



<p>That seemed to be the safest bet, and above all, Sandai also didn’t want it to turn into him being made into a toy again, so he immediately approved it, “A fresh and cool look,” and at the same time gave the request to the hairdresser.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“&#8230;I see. Understood.” The hairdresser nodded with a wry smile and began to deftly get to work.</p>



<p>His freshness and stylishness were upped in a flash, turning Sandai into a clearly different self than before despite not that much change in just the silhouette.</p>



<p>A mild and nice smell drifted from his head from the use of a hairdressing product as the finishing touch; thanks to that, his air or perhaps vibe was becoming much better.</p>



<p>“It’s all done. I’m adding an undercut to trim up the thickness, but just enough that you can’t tell it unless you’re forcibly showing it off. It is simply just to curb the thickness. And then it doesn’t mean the current state is correct, I’m also leaving enough for you to play around with it and work it out on your own. It’s that kind of hairstyle. Next is… I used DEUXER 3 for the wax, but I’m also making sure it can look like that even without making yourself use it, okay? A student probably doesn’t have much money anyway. …How’s this look? I think it’s right on the money on the coolness and freshness, though.”</p>



<p>Sandai apparently had gotten various minute work done, but most of the thing said was lost on him.</p>



<p>But it didn’t seem to be a problem even without much maintenance, so not understanding it seemed problem free.</p>



<p>“Tha-Thank you very much.”</p>



<p>“I’m glad you liked it. So you have a pretty plain face, that said it’s not that bad and looks good you know? It doesn’t seem like it would look out of place in a catalog or something either—that’s right, do come back here if you feel like it, I’ll make a haircut model.”</p>



<p>Even if it was a mere flattery, being complimented made Sandai happy, so he scratched his cheek and got up while feeling bashful.</p>



<p>And then his eyes met with the gyarus who was grinning for some reason.</p>



<p>“Wha-What’s with that face you’re all making? It’s not like it’s weird, right?”</p>



<p>“Eh? Aaah… well it’s not weird.”</p>



<p>“Rather than weird… this is… right?”</p>



<p>“Could it be Shino knew this?”</p>



<p>“She’s not the type to think that far and you know it.”</p>



<p>“Guess so. I think Shino totally didn’t know this. She sure got good intuition~.”</p>



<p>The gyarus were acting weird for some reason, but Sandai couldn’t ask for the reason. After all, he would hate it if it was out of reason like: because there were parts to criticize.</p>



<p>Sandai quickly went outside ahead of them.</p>



<p>“Haahh…” A sigh spontaneously came out of him.</p>



<p>He had just been sitting there, yet was strangely worn out. He would love to quickly go home, but… this wasn’t the end of the makeover.</p>



<p>Even thereafter, Sandai was being dragged around by the gyarus to pick out clothes and shoes, only to find it was halfway through eight in the evening already. It had taken a very long time, but it was also thanks to that that on a glance Sandai had become to look like he could be in some magazine.</p>



<p>“Alright! Makeover done!”</p>



<p>“Hmmm~. He’s gotten to actually look cool, huh.”</p>



<p>“Personally I like it a bit more flashy, though…”</p>



<p>“That’s just your taste. Even so, it’s gotten to the level of making me want to betray Shino a bit. Fujiwara is… the type who seems to be everywhere, but rather hard to find when it comes to searching for him, isn’t it? And his personality doesn’t seem bad either.”</p>



<p>“I get how you feel, but as a person, let’s just drop it.”</p>



<p>Each of the gyarus was giving their final evaluation, but Sandai was beginning to be more concerned about Shino.</p>



<p>Time wise, Shino would be on her way to his apartment after her part-time job. In summary, Sandai would immediately debut his current self to Shino were he to return home.</p>



<p><em>I… changed not in a bad way, right? And will Shino be happy?</em></p>



<p>As Sandai was suppressing his restlessness, “Heyo, Fujiwara. Actually we just contacted Shino earlier, like, ‘We gave your boyfriend a makeover.’ And looks like it&#8217;s just right when she’s done with her part-time, so she said she’s gonna be right over. …Look, here she comes.” Being let known by the gyarus they had called Shino out without him knowing, Sandai hurriedly looked around.</p>



<p>Then he saw Shino coming running while out of breath from a distance. Shino came right before Sandai’s eyes in a flash, and hugged him with full force. Then, with moist eyes, she for some reason ruffled Sandai’s head with all her might.</p>



<p>In the time he was unsure what was going on, the hairstyle he’d gone out of his way to get done by a hairdresser was becoming a mess.</p>



<p>“Shi-Shino…?”</p>



<p>“NOOOOO! DON’T GET COOOOOLER! OTHER GIRLS GONNA START APPROACHING YOU!!! DON’T WANNA!! AND EVERYONE DON’T JUST GIVE SOMEONE’S BOYFRIEND A MAKEOVER WITHOUT PERMISSION! LIKE BEFORE IS FINE!! JUST LIKE THAT IS FINE!!” Shino shouted with her lips quivering.</p>



<p>There wasn’t the slightest sign of her being happy at Sandai’s improved appearance; it was the opposite reaction instead.</p>



<p>She was angry, thinking more about the possibility of him catching the eyes of another woman.</p>



<p>Although little by little, it was still a makeover Sandai had accepted with the thought that it would make Shino happy, but… he got her on the verge of crying as well as ruined her mood.</p>



<p>That was the result, making this Sandai’s first blunder since they had started dating unexpectedly.</p>



<p>“H-Hey.”</p>



<p>Sandai quietly checked on Shino to see her state, to find her raising her brows in anger and biting her lower lip.</p>



<p>Not knowing what to do at a time like this, Sandai briefly raised a complaint to the gyarus with his eyes for help, but the gyarus averted their faces away, absolutely not making eye contact.</p>



<p>“Well… to think Shino would be like this.”</p>



<p>“It’s really just beyond expectations… that Shino is this much in love.”</p>



<p>“What to do?”</p>



<p>“No choice but to run away!”</p>



<p>““““Agree!””””</p>



<p>The gyarus tapped Sandai’s shoulder one by one going, “Take care of the rest, BF-kun,” and they all fled, slipping into the crowd. It was just a moment.</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/mc0wFmz/pujgcba.jpg" alt="pujgcba" border="0"></a>


<p>“H-How irresponsible… Wait!” Sandai hurriedly tried to chase after them, but Shino tightly grabbed his sleeve.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Where are you going?”</p>



<p>“W-Where…?”</p>



<p>“Are you leaving me?”</p>



<p>“That’s not what I… it’s just… I don’t know how to act towards you, Shino… that’s why I thought of asking them…”</p>



<p>“I don’t get it. Why can’t you just ask me? It’s not anyone else who knows best what I want, it’s me.”</p>



<p>The one who would know Shino’s heart best was Shino herself; that was an obvious thing. However, Sandai didn’t notice that due to him panicking.</p>



<p>“You’re my boyfriend, so have confidence and go ask what it is that I want. If you don’t… I’ll hate it.” Tears streaming down Shino’s cheeks fell and spilled on the ground. He ended up making her cry in earnest.</p>



<p>“Sorry…”</p>



<p>“Don’t apologize…”</p>



<p>“I understand. …What is it that you want, Shino?” With his face hanging down at the ever growing feelings of guilt, Sandai decided to be upfront and ask Shino what she wanted. The person in question said she wanted it that way, so to do so would definitely be the right thing to do.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Squeeze me.”</p>



<p>“Eh? Squeeze?”</p>



<p>“It means hug me.”</p>



<p>“A-Aah, so that’s what you mean.”</p>



<p>Sandai hurriedly hugged Shino and gently patted her head as if soothing a small child.</p>



<p>“&#8230;You’re gonna ruin my hair if you do it like that.”</p>



<p>“So-Sorry. Then I’ll stop the patting.”</p>



<p>“No.”</p>



<p>“No, I mean, you said it’s gonna ruin your hair, right?”</p>



<p>“It’s not gonna break that easily. I mean, I didn’t tell you to stop, so don’t stop.”</p>



<p>This would mean telling him to understand the ‘feelings’ hidden behind the words, but what a very high level of demand.</p>



<p>Though, Sandai didn’t make a complaint towards such a demand.</p>



<p>One minute, two minute—as time went by, Shino gradually calmed down and stopped crying.</p>



<p>“&#8230;If another girl approaches you, absolutely don’t go to her, okay?”</p>



<p>What Shino laid bare was a clear possessiveness. It was a truly pure desire of wanting to protect her position as his lover.</p>



<p>If it were a man who would play with a woman’s heart, perhaps they would be proud for making a woman say such words, but Sandai was not of such personality; he simply and only felt sorry—that he had made Shino feel uneasy because of his rash move.</p>



<p>“You don’t have to worry about whether I would go to another woman or not.”</p>



<p>“Really…?”</p>



<p>“Yeah really. I mean, I’m a loner, alright? I’m not popular.”</p>



<p>“There’s absolutely women out there who won’t mind a loner.”</p>



<p>“It’s fine, really. As for me, I’m more worried about whether or not you would dump me than about whether or not a woman like that would show up, Shino.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’m not gonna dump you.” Shino nuzzled her face into Sandai’s chest. Perhaps completely reassured by doing so, Shino’s mood went back to normal.</p>



<p><em>Thank god… I wondered what would happen for a time, but she settled down somehow</em>.</p>



<p>Feeling relieved, Sandai patted Shino’s head just one more time, and explained many of the various details of today. All of it.</p>



<p>“&#8230;As for me, I just wanted to make you happy, Shino. They’re also saying they would be the one paying and all, so yeah,” Sandai finished sharing the details, only for Shino to be astonished.</p>



<p>“I’m happy that you wanted to make me happy, but… try to think about it for a bit. For example, how would you feel if I begin saying things like, ‘I got forcibly kidnapped by your friends, Sandai, but I got into it in the middle♪. They were surprisingly nice to me and also paid for me, and I got cute thanks to that, too. So you’ll also be happy right?’ Somehow it makes you feel unpleasant, right? Feel disappointed, right? Uneasy, right?”</p>



<p>Completely as Shino said, and Sandai was at a loss for words.</p>



<p>Too much fooling around with the opposite sex—seeing it from the view of the one affected, it was an unpleasantness inducing act that looked like nothing but a betrayal.</p>



<p>“You’re right… If the same thing done to me, I think I’ll feel very unpleasant.”</p>



<p>“Right? That’s why stuff like that is now ‘nopenope’, okay?”</p>



<p>“Nopenope…”</p>



<p>“Not trying to be cute. Just now means: don’t fool around.”</p>



<p>“I know. I’m sorry…”</p>



<p>“Yeah… Also, I don’t know if it’s a gathering or dinner party or whatever, but I’m not gonna go, okay? I’ll refuse it.”</p>



<p>Shino sighed and roughly placed her phone to her ear. Apparently she would be directing her anger not to Sandai, but to her own friends.</p>



<p>When a third party of the opposite sex is involved with one’s lover, there will be a difference in how men and women react—such is one of the well-known say. It is said that many men would take out their anger on their girlfriend, and rather than towards their boyfriend, many women would direct their anger towards the same sex who tried to kidnap their boyfriend.</p>



<p>And Shino seemed to be no exception to this.</p>



<p>With each repeated ringing tone before the call connected, Shino was looking more and more furious. Sandai was worried whether he should soothe her, but if he opened his mouth now, it seemed like she would say, ‘Why are you defending other women?’ so he quit it.</p>



<p>He could read the mood that much.</p>



<p><em>“Shino, what’s wrong?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Looks like there’s some gathering or something whatever, but I’m absolutely not gonna go!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Oof, you sure seriously got so mad. You wanna convey your raw emotion, and so like you called?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I&#8217;m sure it’s just gonna get ignored anyway if I take out my anger in the groupchat! You’re toying with someone’s boyfriend, and used that as an excuse to lure me out to top it off, have you got no human heart? Go be sorry now!”</em></p>



<p><em>“That Fujiwara sure did tip us off…”</em></p>



<p><em>“Sandai did nothing wrong! You’re the one at fault! Don’t play games with me!”</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s not like we’re trying to…”</em></p>



<p><em>“BE &#8211; SORRY!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Ye-Yes.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Good grief.”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;Well umm… we also want a BF, so you know…”</em></p>



<p><em>“Go put in an effort if you want a boyfriend. I also put in an effort here.”</em></p>



<p><em>“We do know that, though. Totally. Still, he made you put in effort, Fujiwara is pretty amazing, huh? Even though generally it’s the men who kneel.”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;Don’t play with me. Then bye.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Nn.”</em></p>



<p>Shino roughly cut the call and tugged on Sandai’s sleeve.</p>



<p>“Wha-What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“I want a mood lift.” Shino raised her face and closed her eyes, appealing for him to guess what she wanted even without putting it into words.</p>



<p>He immediately knew the correct answer; he just had to kiss her. Shino was telling him that everything would be bygones then.</p>



<p>Sandai closed his eyes and put his lips on hers.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Nnh.”</p>



<p>Shino’s charming, sigh mixed voice was something he had heard many times, but it held a mysterious addiction that would make him want to hear it over and over again.</p>



<p><em>I want to hear this voice… just a bit more</em>.</p>


<a href="https://ibb.co/QHCNDDJ"><img src="https://i.ibb.co/jwWMJJ8/xqjay5d.jpg" alt="xqjay5d" border="0"></a>


<p>When their lips were in contact for long enough that counting the time becoming bothersome after Sandai succumbing to such desire, looking pained, Shino pushed his body in a jerk with both hands.</p>



<p>“I-I’m satisfied now! Sure with the mood it was me who asked for it, but does it normally take this long~?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I can’t?”</p>



<p>“Not that you can’t, but there’s gotta be moderation.”</p>



<p>“Well about that, yeah, I’d say because it made me want to hear it.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Made you want to hear it?”</p>



<p>“Your sigh is cute, so it just made me want to hear it again and again,” Sandai said while scratching the tip of his nose, making Shino’s face turn red immediately.</p>



<p>Sandai would seldomly face his own desire and put it into words; thanks to that, the brief remark just now seemed to have affected Shino unexpectedly.</p>



<p>“Even if you say that… Y-Yeah yeah! I understand what you’re trying to say! I hear you loud and clear~!” Shino said like howling and quickly began to walk, but not watching where she was going, she hit her head on a utility pole, “Gueh!” and let out un-girlish voice.</p>



<p>Sandai almost laughed at the way Shino was flustering, which was the kind he had never seen before, but enjoying it would be mean, so he immediately chased after her and held her hand instead of laughing.</p>



<p>“Wha-What?”</p>



<p>“Holding hands gotta be better. You were staggering there, alright? What are you gonna do if you get hit by a car or something?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Hey.”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“I love you,” Shino said and turned around.</p>



<p>She had a radiant smile.</p>



<p>Although Sandai knew that Shino had an abundance of emotions and expressions, a surprised attack still got him startled.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“So what’s up with the sudden silence?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s nothing.”</p>



<p>“Should I guess why you went silent~? …Maybe like, you got startled? ‘Cause I actually kinda aimed for it.”</p>



<p>The ‘I love you’ earlier seemed to be on purpose, and Sandai fell for it spectacularly.</p>



<p>There is the so-called ‘initiative’ in love, and it is the rein that everyone wants to grab; and in fact, Sandai also would love to have the initiative close at hand.</p>



<p>So it had been a good opportunity for having made Shino flustered, but… the situation immediately got turned upside down by her surprise attack.</p>



<p>That said, Sandai didn’t intend to fully give up, so he played the fool to suggest that the surprise attack just now wasn’t effective.</p>



<p>“Did you… say something just now? I couldn’t hear you clearly.”</p>



<p>“Eh? No I’m saying—”</p>



<p>“—Yeah? I can’t really hear you, though?”</p>



<p>“E-Eeh…?”</p>



<p>“Sorry, my bad I can’t hear you. I got bananas in my ears.”</p>



<p>“You sure are trying to snatch the pace so forcefully. Actually, what’s with ‘I got bananas in my ears’? Well, it’s not the first time you’re saying something weird, though. …By the way.”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“So tomorrow, do you have something to do right after school?”</p>



<p>“What now, that’s so sudden.”</p>



<p>“It’s the plan to spread the fact that we’re dating, right?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Is something wrong with that?”</p>



<p>“Can you come to my workplace? If I introduce you at my workplace, I think it would spread from there, too. I actually thought of having those girls do it, but they’re just trying to mess around with someone’s boyfriend… It’s like, I’ve got a terrible feeling it will turn out awful if I ask them, so I don’t really want to ask them.”</p>



<p>In her own way, Shino should certainly have taken it out on her friends, but while that might be true, it apparently didn&#8217;t mean that she had forgotten all of her anger.</p>



<p>Well, setting that aside, making their dating relationship itself also known outside of school was also one of the reasons why Sandai had decided to listen to the gyarus. Thus he had no real reluctance to it.</p>



<p>“If that’s the case then.”</p>



<p>“Can I take that as an OK?”</p>



<p>“I don’t really mind.”</p>



<p>“Thanks! Then we’ll go there together. It’s tomorrow, okay?”</p>



<p>“I got it.”</p>



<p>Thus tomorrow Sandai would head to Shino’s workplace.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>


<p>The next day. Sandai felt that the time passed by faster than usual; as he was taking classes quietly as usual, it instantly became after school..</p>



<p>“&#8230;That’s all. All right, all dismissed. Scatter,” the class teacher Nakaoka announced the end of the homeroom and listlessly went to leave the classroom while yawning. Each of his classmates were also leaving, starting with those who got club activities, committees, or stuff to do.</p>



<p>Sandai also began to pack his textbooks into his bag in preparation to return home. Then from the seat behind Sandai, Shino grabbed him by the collar and pulled him back along with the chair with a jerk.</p>



<p>“Oof.”</p>



<p>“It’s after school!”</p>



<p>Srrt—the sound of the chair being dragged across the floor echoed powerfully and attracted the attention of the classmates still in the classroom.</p>



<p>Sandai as well, he looked at Shino while repeatedly blinking his eyes wondering what was happening.</p>



<p>“It’s after school, y’know〜. You remember, right?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;No way I’m gonna forget a promise made just yesterday. I clearly remember the talk about going to your workplace together, Shino. It’s just, our relationship is still totally not known at school, so for now we’re gonna go out of the school separately and then…”</p>



<p>“Then let’s go!!”</p>



<p>Shino forcibly pulled Sandai’s hand and kept on moving.</p>



<p>Given that the only people at school who certainly knew their relationship were Shino’s friends and their classroom teacher Nakaoka, it goes without saying that they attracted attention from the rest of the school.</p>



<p>Though, just like Shino had pointed out before, there seemed to be no small number of people suspecting it, so a part of them could be heard saying, ‘I knew it,’ but…</p>



<p><em>“Hey look.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Are you serious…”</em></p>



<p><em>“Well they’ve been rumored a lot for some time now.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Wasn’t that just some misunderstanding? And so that’s why the rumor went away pretty fast.”</em></p>



<p><em>“That’s true, but the sus feeling continues, y’know? I mean, sometimes they were also staring at each other. And that’s not just once or twice, but again and again.”</em></p>



<p><em>“You saw them staring at each other many times…? Why are you witnessing something that’s only happening occasionally like that?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I liked her, alright? I liked Yuizaki, that’s why I was always watching. I knew even if I didn’t like it. And it’s not just me, the guys who were watching Yuizaki.”</em></p>



<p><em>“You were always watching…? And there are others…? What’s with this school? Does it have a stalker infestation?”</em></p>



<p><em>“That guy, he’s Fujiwara-kun from Yuizaki-san’s class, isn&#8217;t he? He’s plain so I don’t remember if we might’ve passed by each other, but on second look, he’s a pretty cool looking guy, huh.”</em></p>



<p><em>“And apparently Fujiwara is really kind… wait, I think it was Yuizaki-san who said that. I feel like I heard she said something like that the very first time the rumor started. Well, that means she’s caught an excellent hidden gem.”</em></p>


<p>He could guess what was being said; it was ‘Those two…’ stuffs</p>



<p>“I wonder if actually showing our relationship at school would surely make it spread out gradually… Just kiddin’! The truth is I can’t hold it anymore. And I also want you to be aware that the initiative is on me, Sandai~.” Shino stuck out her tongue and smiled mischievously.</p>



<p>Although dumbfounded, Sandai quickly understood the situation.</p>



<p>In short, Shino wanted to say that Sandai’s way was slow; as well as saying that as the one taking the initiative regarding their lovers&#8217; relationship, she got the right to revise that.</p>



<p>Sandai was being hit by a considerable selfishness, but it being done this brazenly was just so refreshing that he felt no desire to complain.</p>



<p>They went out of the entrance, out of the school gate, and onto the sidewalk. And while still being led by the hand by Shino, they arrived at a block a little off the city center after about thirty minutes.</p>



<p>Although away from the shopping district, it was a place with a fair amount of pedestrian traffic.</p>



<p>“It’s that one.” What Shino pointed at was a cafe of an antique-style exterior with a calming atmosphere; that seemed to be her workplace.</p>



<p><em>Somehow… It sure is an atmosphere the ladies seem to really like.</em></p>



<p>Sandai got some bad feeling, and unfortunately, it came true; once inside, all of the customers and employees were women only.</p>



<p>On the blackboard by the counter that suddenly entered his view was written with: ‘Everyday is 30% off for ladies♪’ along with drawings of cute deformed animals.</p>



<p>“What an amazing place…”</p>



<p>“You think so?”</p>



<p>“It’s all women here.”</p>



<p>“Well I’m not good with guys, so…”</p>



<p>Although it might get misunderstood when they were together, Shino was basically not good with men. Choosing a part-time job with a high percentage of women like this was obvious.</p>



<p>Although Sandai could understand it, he felt timid at this overwhelming, away disadvantage feeling.</p>



<p>“Go take the seat at the back there.” Then Shino just left her own standing-stock-still boyfriend and disappeared beyond the door written with: ‘Employees Only.’</p>



<p>For the time being… Sandai hurriedly moved. On the way, he got suspiciously looked at by the female customers. Though, “Ah, excuse me,” he said, lowering his head and cutting his way through.</p>



<p>And then, “&#8230;Nn?” Feeling eyes on him upon taking a seat, Sandai restlessly looked around.</p>



<p>Then he noticed a number of female employees staring at him through the gap in the employees-only door Shino had just entered.</p>


<p><em>“Shino-chan says she brought her boyfriend, but… it’s that?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Shinopi said it’s that seat, so isn’t that the case? Hmm but it might be a bit of a letdown. I just didn’t think it would be background character-ish like that~.”</em></p>



<p><em>“He’s plain but sure is a cute guy. Isn’t the ‘background character-ish’ because you’re making your own too deep of character as a standard? Like those twirling ringlets or I guess chocolate cornets… that hairstyle is just too intense.”</em></p>



<p><em>“How cruel! These aren’t chocolate cornets! This hairstyle is cute! I’m taking an hour everyday getting it done, you know!? Boohoo!! Waaa waaa!!”</em></p>



<p><em>“I’ve told you not to make fun of this girl’s hairstyle. She’d immediately cry.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Sorry sorry. That hairstyle sure is cute.”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;Yeah.”</em></p>



<p><em>“But well, Shino-chan herself is surprisingly a serious girl, so considering that, I guess it might be just inevitable for her to choose a guy like that.”</em></p>



<p><em>“That’s for sure… wait urgh the assistant manager, since when did you…”</em></p>



<p><em>“What? Got a problem?”</em></p>



<p><em>“No Ma&#8217;am.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Then good. Now someone hurry up and bring out the boyfriend privilege.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Go, Chocolate Cornets. It’s cute so go.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Uwh… I’m telling you it’s not chocolate cornets… wait do you really think it’s cute?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I do so just go.”</em></p>


<p>He couldn’t tell what they were saying because of the physical distance. But still, even Sandai understood that they were holding curiosity.</p>



<p>Perhaps Shino had already told them about Sandai. So they should be coming out to observe out of curiosity.</p>



<p><em>I guess… I can’t tell them I want them to stop staring. They’re Shino’s co-workers, and if they think that I’m a man with a troublesome personality, I suppose it’s possible it would make it hard for Shino to stay working here.</em></p>



<p>Sandai decided to just keep his mind empty. Then a waitress with a hairstyle like chocolate cornets walked up to him.</p>



<p>The girl who looked about the same age as Sandai and Shino gently placed a small cake and a cup of tea on the table.</p>



<p>“H-Here you go~. Enjoy~.”</p>



<p>As Sandai was a little bewildered by being presented with something he didn’t remember ordering, the girl spoke up in a flirty-like voice while hiding her face with the tray. “Shinopi’s Boyfriend-kun… I’m correct, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s… right, but… what’s with the cake and tea by the way?”</p>



<p>“This is a boyfriend privilege~. We serve it to our employee’s boyfriend for free, limited to once a day.”</p>



<p>“Uh-Uhuh.”</p>



<p>“And so I’d like to ask about all sorts of things between you and Shinopi… ah no not good, I’ll get yelled at if I do a voyeur-like thing like this… Well, Shinopi will soon introduce you anyway, so just wait until then, okay? Then later,” the girl said in rapid fire, and then left in a small run going, “Hya~,” while still hiding her face with the tray.</p>



<p>She was a somewhat bizarre girl, but that aside, the cake and tea seemed to be free as some kind of a boyfriend privilege, so he decided to accept it.</p>

		
<p>Both the cake and tea were fairly good, so half of them immediately made their way into his stomach.</p>



<p>And right then Shino showed up.</p>



<p>She’d changed into the same uniform of the waitress from earlier—a triangular neckerchief on a white shirt, and a seemingly common, calm-colored beige apron dress with the shop’s logo on it.</p>



<p>It was a very ordinary uniform, not the kind that would put importance on frilly-like cuteness nor the risque kind you’d find in a shop catering towards male customers. That said, it looked so cute when Shino wore it.</p>



<p>“Ehehe… I’m showing you this outfit for the first time, but what do you think?”</p>



<p>“It looks good on you.”</p>



<p>“Yay!” Shino raised both hands in delight, and immediately called and gathered her not-busy co-workers, and smilingly and happily began the introduction. “Ahem… Sorry to have kept you waiting. Now I will formally introduce him to everyone—this is my boyfriend, Fujiwara Sandai.”</p>



<p>The assembled girls in unison all went, “Oooh~,” and then launched a barrage of questions as if to say they’d been waiting for this.</p>



<p>“Fujiwara-kun, hey hey, how did you guys end up dating?”</p>



<p>“How far have you gone? Have you at least kissed?”</p>



<p>“Who was the one confessing~? Or was it more like you were dating by the time you realized it? I wanna know so badly~!”</p>



<p>Being vigorously pressed on by multiple people all at once, “Uwh,” Sandai groaned. He reflexively sent a gaze asking for help to Shino.</p>



<p>His heartfeltness seemed to have reached Shino without problem; she replied with a wink and clapped her hands multiple times.</p>



<p>“Everyone calm down~. Allow me to explain one by one. First is the one who fell in love first. If I had to pick, it was me.”</p>



<p>“Does that mean the one attacking was also you, Shino-chan?”</p>



<p>“Ahem!” Shino puffed up her chest, and the girls’ eyes sparkled all at once.</p>



<p>“You sure are courageous~. I’ve also got a boyfriend, but it’s kind of not sitting well with me to be the one saying it, so I just forcibly induced him to say it.”</p>



<p>“Speaking of guys, they’re surprisingly timid, so they really wouldn’t just say it, don’t they? It’s possible for them to get snatched up by another girl in the time you’re wondering whether they would straight up say it, so I just know it’s better to quickly convey my feelings than to have it come to that.”</p>



<p>“Wooow~, oh gosh~ I want a BF, too~.”</p>



<p>“I see, so Shino-chan who did, huh… Alright, I, a senior in life and an assistant manager, have some words to say here. I think it’s good you were the one confessing, Shino-chan. It’s because just because you’re a girl, it’s not right to just wait. And so for Fujiwara-kun… Don’t take advantage of that just because you were the one who got confessed. Don’t say something like, ‘It’s not me who fell in love.’ It’s because you bear responsibility for the fact you got confessed to. You accepted the confession because you like her, right? Then having made her say it is a chain. So you have to devote yourself to Shino-chan.”</p>



<p>“So the one getting confessed bears responsibility? Then what about the responsibility of the one who said it, eh? …That kinda thinking is why you still don’t have a boyfriend.”</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/S66k9Vs/f34gycy.jpg" alt="f34gycy" border="0"></a>


<p>“You said something?”</p>



<p>“Eh? I’m not saying anything, you know? Isn’t it just your imagination?”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“I heard it~. You got bad-mouthed, you know?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“Ugh.”</p>



<p>“She says the assistant manager is a pain in the butt~. She says you’re annoying ‘cause of all the constant complaining, and ‘cause of that you won’t even be able to know true love, and the sighing during breaks is also overbearing so she wants you to stop or something like that~.”</p>



<p>“I didn’t say that! I didn’t say that much! That’s basically just what you’re feeling! This friggin chocolate cornets—aah, Assistant Manager, please stop that scary face.”</p>



<p>Then Sandai just got ignored, and it was turning into insider’s talk, but this seemed to be the usual scene seeing as how Shino was smiling wryly.</p>



<p>Well, Sandai wasn’t good with being put in the center of a conversation surrounded by a large group of people and getting talked to about this and that, so it could be said that it saved him.</p>



<p>In the meantime, by the end both Shino and the other girls began to get back to their work.</p>



<p>Time went by little by little, and the number of customers began to grow around the time the evening sun was setting. Office ladies in suits who must’ve come from the business district came in to occupy more and more seats.</p>



<p><em>Guess time to head back…</em></p>



<p>Both the cake and tea from the boyfriend privilege were already gone, and any further stay would just be a nuisance wastefully occupying a seat.</p>



<p>Sandai got up from his seat and tried to leave after letting Shino know, but he couldn’t see her anywhere, so he reluctantly decided to drop a verbal message to a nearby waitress girl.</p>



<p>“Umm… excuse me. I’m heading back now, so I wonder if you could let Shino know.”</p>



<p>“Eh? Wa-Wait a bit BF-kun. Shino-chan’s in the back right now.”</p>



<p>“It’s fine, you don’t have to call her.”</p>



<p>“No no, it’s not like that. Shino-chan’s getting ready to leave now. She’ll be out soon so just wait for her.”</p>



<p>“Eh?” And right then Shino came out from the back in her school uniform. “But her work hours…”</p>



<p>Currently it was a little past six in the evening, but usually Shino would be working until about half past eight, so she was clocking out more than two hours early.</p>



<p>“Let&#8217;s head back together.”</p>



<p>“Are you done with work?”</p>



<p>“I got told I can leave already today. The assistant manager told me, ‘I’ll keep your earnings like you’ve worked the usual hours, so go be with your boyfriend.’ It’s gonna get a little busier at this time of day, that said it’s a weekday so they’ll manage she said. …Well, I also got warned, though. She said the privilege is a service to help the boyfriend coming to pick us up pass time while waiting, and next time I should have you come around the time I’m done with work.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I see. Then I guess I’ve gotta pick you up around the time you’re done with work.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You’ll go pick me up?”</p>



<p>Sandai spontaneously nodded; after all, it was an act natural for a boyfriend to do. However, Shino was very happy with such a natural gesture.</p>



<p>“Thank you!!” Shino said and intertwined her arms around his; with too much gusto, and his arm hitting her chest… Sandai spontaneously scratched the tip of his nose at the soft sensation.</p>



<p>Guys can also be said to be a profoundly mysterious creature in a different sense from girls. Even if the other person is their girlfriend, there are times when they are dominated by awkwardness when they touch an unexpected part of the body.</p>



<p>“S-So, what are we gonna do now? Anywhere you wanna go?”</p>



<p>“Somewhere I wanna go… Then wanna see fall colors? I looked it up on my phone and found the fall leaves are at its peak right now in Memorial Park. A go-to choice for a date in fall! Or so they say.”</p>



<p>“Let’s go there then.”</p>



<p>Sandai had never been to a place like the Memorial Park and such, but it was surprisingly close by; it was a place only 10-minute walk away.</p>



<p>“Wooow amazing! So pretty.” At the same time as entering the park, Shino dropped her walking pace, and her eyes sparkled from seeing the rows of fall colors shined by lights. The ginkgo and maple trees that were beginning to turn into deep colors of fall were vibrant, and the dancing falling leaves evoked a strong sense of the season.</p>



<p>Suddenly, they both stopped. Simultaneously with the sun completely setting, the light up enhancing the fall colors suddenly lit up.</p>



<p>“It’s sparkling.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;It sure is sparkling.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;&#8230;Yeah.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;&#8230;”</p>



<p>It being a weekday, the park got few people and was quiet, and as if to match such an atmosphere, the number of times they spoke continuously decreased.</p>



<p>Although they eventually stopped exchanging words altogether, it wasn’t particularly awkward. The warmth transmitted from their intertwined arms was much more eloquent than words in showing the depth of their bond.</p>



<p>Though, “Fuaaahh…” Shino suddenly yawned.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Tired?”</p>



<p>“A bit…” Shino rubbed her eyelids, making her eyeshadow collapse slightly.</p>



<p>Sandai was troubled whether he should tell her, but he decided to not tell her now but at parting.</p>



<p>“&#8230;C’mon, hop on my back. I’ll carry you to the station.”</p>



<p>“Nn…”</p>



<p>Carrying Shino on his back, “Heave-ho,” Sandai stood up, and a mild vanilla-like smell grazed his nose. When he sniffled in search for the source, he found it came from the back of Shino’s hands.</p>



<p><em>…The smell of hand cream, huh. Well, it’s already fall I guess.</em></p>



<p>Shino seemed to have begun to pay more attention to moisturizing, perhaps because it was the season of dry air.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Sorry for making you carry me.”</p>



<p>“No need to apologize. I’ll wake you up when we arrive at the station, so just sleep till then.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Thanks.”</p>



<p>Shino’s chest was pressed to his back, and there was the feel of her butt in the palms of his hands, but he didn’t feel too awkward this time. Each time he captured the sound of Shino breathing through her sleep close to his ear, only and only the thought of wanting her to get a good rest welled up.</p>



<p>Taking care to walk at a steady pace so as not to shake Shino as much as possible seemed to have made her able to rest a bit, and her complexion was improved by the time he woke her up at the station.</p>



<p>“Then see you tomorrow.”</p>



<p>“Oui. See you. …Goodbye smooch.”</p>



<p>“All right.”</p>



<p>He gave her a goodbye kiss as the train’s arrival broadcast was being announced. Chu—despite feeling reluctant to part at the sound of their lips parting, Sandai then told Shino that her eyeshadow was crumbling. “&#8230;By the way, Shino.”</p>



<p>“Yeah? What is it?”</p>



<p>“Your eyelids are a mess there.”</p>



<p>“Eh? Wah, wawah! …It is!” Shino was startled by the reflection of her own face on a small mirror she pulled out of her bag, and started removing the eyeshadow with cotton immediately. “Aww~&#8230;”</p>



<p>“You rubbed your eyelids when you got sleepy in Memorial Park, right? I guess that’s when.”</p>



<p>“That’s before you were carrying me! You should’ve let me know at that time! Aaa~even though I didn’t want to show you something like this… geez… what should I do… reapplying is a pain, too… no choice, might as well take off all the makeup now it’s gotten to this…”</p>



<p>Shino was also cute with no makeup; or better say, without makeup she was mature-like and pretty instead.</p>



<p>And yet why would she care so much about makeup?</p>



<p>Sandai could somehow guess that girls tended to try to express what they thought was cute rather than genuinely seeking beauty, but he couldn’t really accept it. He thought that if the no-makeup was the most lovely, then they should just show themselves as they were.</p>



<p>Though, he could tell from looking at Shino that she was putting an utmost effort into looking ‘cute,’ and nobody would want to be denied what they were giving their best at, so he didn’t say anything unnecessary, though…</p>



<p>Well, there was also the perk of being able to enjoy two versions, before and after makeup. It seemed like a good idea to secretly enjoy the 2-in-1 deliciousness without saying anything.</p>

<p>After seeing off Shino’s train, Sandai noticed that he himself was also tired, went home, and immediately took a bath.</p>



<p>Having finished taking the somewhat longer than usual bathing, he wiped dry his body and head, and lay down on the living room sofa. He was gradually overwhelmed by sleepiness, but he couldn’t afford to sleep as there would still be late-night anime.</p>



<p>As Sandai was leisurely and idly watching the TV to wait for the start of the broadcast, a brief news special being held between programs appeared on the screen.</p>


<p>‘It’s still the height of fall, but some seem to be already scrambling and getting busy for Christmas. Christmas is an ideal day to give a present to your special someone to convey your continuous appreciation for them. Today, we will be reporting on the people who work behind the scenes to make such a Christmas happen.’</p>



<p><em>Speaking of which… Christmas will be in two months. I’ve gotta prepare something myself</em>, Sandai spontaneously thought.</p>



<p>However, he didn’t know what he should give despite racking his brain to think about it.</p>



<p>Taking Shino’s personality into account, it was easy to imagine her getting happy no matter the present, but for this reason he ended up troubled.</p>



<p>It would be easy if Sandai could just coldly cut corners and choose something half-heartedly if she would be happy no matter what he would give, but unfortunately, Sandai was of a character who’d want to be meticulous about such a thing.</p>



<p>“Hmmmm…” He ruffled and scratched his head. He got stuck in a precarious situation, becoming more unsure the more he worried. “Well… there’s time until Christmas.”</p>



<p>That was an answer derived from Sandai’s rule of thumb; that it would be best to take some pause when his thoughts got stuck in a mud.</p>



<p>There had been little he had gained to date from forcibly hurrying.</p>



<p>In elementary school, he had fallen down and gotten injured when running in a hurry because of almost arriving late.</p>



<p>In middle school, he had ended up dozing off before watching late-night anime, and in a panic of waking up and looking for the remote to turn on the TV, he had stepped on it and broken it.</p>



<p>So he had decided to drop it for today and think about it next Sunday. On Sunday during the day Shino would also be working at her part-time job, so Sandai got extra time to spare.</p>


<p>‘Well then, have a pleasant night everyone.’</p>



<p>The image of the newscaster with a big smile turned into a commercial, and when that too ended, late-night anime started. It was already such a time.</p>


<p>‘Let us begin!!!!’</p>



<p>Today’s late-night anime was a school romantic comedy depicting a fun school life. Sandai looked for a character that would resemble Shino somehow.</p>



<p>He knew it would be futile to search for one as this series had been progressing far in the number of episodes and not even a single look-alike had appeared.</p>



<p>He was aware that he was doing something puzzling.</p>



<p>In the first place, he could’ve just looked at the said person, and they were also doing something like kissing usually. There was no need to seek for Shino even in the 2D world.</p>



<p>But there was still a part of him ending up seeking it.</p>



<p>“Too bad…”</p>



<p>Sandai finished watching the late-night anime along with a sigh and crawled into bed.</p>
