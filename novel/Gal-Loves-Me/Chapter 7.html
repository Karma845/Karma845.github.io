<h3>Chapter 7 – The Dull Youth Is Vibrant Before You Know It, Huh?</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>The interview for the part-time job had gone off with a success. That said, Sandai got busy again without even being allowed to catch a breath; the school festival was here.</p>



<p>It being Saturday, the school festival was very bustling. Other than the local residents, there were plenty of people like students of other schools and college students showing up.</p>



<p>For having decided to not participate and ignore it last year, Sandai was completely not in the know of the scale of the school festival and bewildered by the scene in front of him.</p>



<p>“&#8230;So it would gather this many, huh.”</p>



<p>Shino chuckled from seeing Sandai with his eyes wide open and scratching his cheek. “Fufu, well… our school is on the large side in student numbers, so there’s also the scale to go with it. Many people will also come to see.”</p>



<p>“I ignored it last year, so I didn’t know.”</p>



<p>“I think I participated last year more or less, since I got a bit of time and all. They said we were gonna do a haunted house, so I got to be a ghost.”</p>



<p>“Oh really?”</p>



<p>“It was a very common program, and yet somehow it got popular and many people just came to see. Many people would also stop and stare hard at me, so I thought I must’ve done a really good job at the ghost makeup, so it made me somewhat happy.”</p>



<p>The cause for attracting visitors hadn’t been because she had done a good job of disguising as a ghost, but because a very stunning beautiful girl had been doing the role of a ghost. Without a doubt.</p>



<p>However, the person in question was happy thinking that it had been because she’d done a good job with the makeup. To untactfully say ‘that’s not that case’ would only spoil her mood, so Sandai gave a suitable interjection.</p>



<p>Well anyhow.</p>



<p>Sandai and Shino moved to carry out what the class president had previously told them to; helping out behind the scenes with the cafe of their class program.</p>



<p>Among several girls and guys including Takasago working attentively, they nonchalantly joined in while trying to be as inconspicuous as possible.</p>



<p>But the presence created by a couple of a different qualities that of a gyaru and a loner by no means could be hidden that easily.</p>



<p>“Hey, pass me the honey there.”</p>



<p>“This one?”</p>



<p>“Yup.</p>



<p>“Honey again~.”</p>



<p>“You’re gonna put on more honey? Won’t that make it too sweet?”</p>



<p>“That also depends on the honey type, I think? Because the taste will change based on what kind of flowers the bees get the nectar from. For this one, look, it says ‘chestnut flowers’ so it’s got a slight bitterness to it.”</p>



<p>“The taste will change depending on the flower… now that you mentioned it, that’s true too, huh. By the way, they call it <em>honey </em>in English, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Can you try calling me <em>honey</em> for a bit?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;<em>Honey</em>.”</p>



<p>“Oh gosh, it’s giving butterflies so much!”</p>



<p>Such was the exchange those two were having, so the classmates working behind the scene immediately noticed it, and some looked away and got distracted; like ending up mistaking salt for sugar and putting in a huge amount of it.</p>



<p>“What a lucky guy Fujiwara is, dating a girl like Yuizaki-san. I want a cute girlfriend, too.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I want a boyfriend, too. A cool boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“Fujiwara-kun got a beautiful girl like Yuizaki-san, so maybe we can get a super hot hunk too in reverse, so it’s like giving a big push in the back, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“If I do my best, maybe I can also get a beautiful girlfriend, too…”</p>



<p>“Shihouin-kun… I wonder what he thinks of me…”</p>



<p>Being hit by the sugar in the air was maybe making them want to consume sugar themselves—all the audible murmurs were suggesting nothing but that.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>



<p>The school festival went on without incident, and time just flew peacefully… or so Sandai thought, but things behind the scenes were beginning to gradually get busier.</p>



<p>He got a feeling something was off.</p>



<p>What they were doing was just a cafe, and he didn’t really get how it could get busier given that there was not a shred of newness about it.</p>



<p>Sandai took a peek at the scene—</p>



<p>Only to find male customers as far as the eyes could see spread out there.</p>



<p>He could also see the sight of girls wearing bunny ears and cat ears on their head in a risqué outfit of garter belt and bunny girl suit serving customers.</p>



<p>In many senses, it was a spectacle that just made him want to cover his eyes, but upon second thought, the omen had been there from the start that it would turn like this. Shino had refused to dress in a risqué outfit, but the situation that made it seem normal to dress in a risqué outfit was weird in the first place.</p>



<p>That was to say, it had already been done deal by then that it wouldn’t be a normal cafe.</p>



<p>“You sure have come just at the right time, Fujiwara-kun.”</p>



<p>“Guweh,” Sandai yelped from having the collar of his uniform suddenly grabbed. He looked back and found it was the class president.</p>



<p>“Actually, we made one too many signboards because we got the numbers wrong, you see. It’s a waste, so I’ll also count on you to use this to tout to people. Go parade it around the school,” the class president said and made Sandai hold a somehow suspicious black signboard.</p>



<p>“Eeeh… making me do it just because there’s an extra signboard is just not what you promised.”</p>



<p>“I can’t hear you, Fujiwara-kun. It’s ‘strike while the iron is hot’ as they say.”</p>



<p>Sandai stared full of doubt at the signboard while being pushed by the class president with a gusto. This was what had been written there with a pink, rounder handwriting:</p>



<p>‘Cute girls in risqué outfits going nyan nyan~ serving customers nyan~.’</p>



<p>Just like a signboard for a sex establishment.</p>



<p>This would make the adults mad no matter how you looked at it, and it was strange that the serious-looking class president hadn’t given this any doubt, but Sandai could tell from looking at those excessively shining eyes of the class president that he was losing his cool.</p>



<p>‘Essentially the last school festival.’</p>



<p>The class president had mentioned that, but precisely because it was the last school festival where they could go all out, he had gotten so passionate that he had ended up forgetting common sense. Since there were no other classmates who expressly saw this as a problem, Sandai could tell that the whole class was of the same sentiment.</p>



<p>It would also be useless pointing out anything to people who lost sight of their surroundings, and it would only lead to a fight. Wanting to steer away from unnecessary dispute, Sandai reluctantly decided to take on the job.</p>



<p>For now, he tried to wander around while holding the signboard to keep up appearances. If he looked like ‘doing it half-heartedly but it was just a formality’ for the touting, it should be okay.</p>



<p>Perhaps it was a bad idea to walk around without wariness due to such a mental attitude—Sandai, who was walking around the school at random, encountered someone he must not encounter.</p>



<p>“Hey Fujiwara, what’s that signboard?” He got found by Nakaoka. “Cute girls in risqué outfits going nyan nyan…? I remember giving permission when I heard you were going to do a cafe, but I don’t remember giving permission to do anything like a night shop like this, though?”</p>



<p>“Umm…”</p>



<p>“What on earth is going on here?”</p>



<p>“I was just told to hold this and advertise it, so…”</p>



<p>“I see.” Nakaoka placed her hand on her chin and wrinkled her brows. She then said, “Well you know… the school festival is open to the general public, so that means it’s attracting an unspecified large number of people. It’s necessary to give a certain amount of thought at an event like this. We probably can’t change the theme of the program now, so I guess our class will be canceled.”</p>



<p><em>I suppose that’s how it is</em>, was Sandai’s honest feelings.</p>



<p>For example, even if it was a reckless enthusiasm resulting from striving to make memories, it was a given for high school students to be chastised for brazenly copying a questionable shop in broad daylight.</p>



<p>Sandai looked up to the sky.</p>



<p>The sun was high in the sky, and it was probably about noon.</p>



<p>Although the school festival as a whole had only just begun, the school festival of Sandai’s class came to an end without reaching the most exciting moment.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center:"><strong>3</strong></p>


style="height:50px;" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>‘The cafe is closed’</p>



<p>Nakaoka stuck a paper with that written on it on the door, sighed, and walked into the classroom. And then Sandai’s classmates began to complain to Nakaoka one after another.</p>



<p>“It’s not like there was any physical contact!”</p>



<p>“We just put on a slightly lewd outfit, didn’t we…?”</p>



<p>“It was a little embarrassing, but some people gave a tip too, so…”</p>



<p>“We just ran a cafe with a peculiar outfit! The people who think this is erotic are the one who are perverted!”</p>



<p>Nakaoka glanced at the bawling out classmates, sucked in a deep breath, and rebuked loudly. “DON’T COMPLAIN! BE SILENT!”</p>



<p>Although Nakaoka would at times amuse herself over the recklessness of students’ youth, she would also at times get serious. She was the type who would respect the independence of students, but would get firm and mad if a line that must not be crossed was crossed.</p>



<p>And the classmates, perhaps as one would expect coming to an understanding that they had gone slightly over the bounds of common sense, began to yield one after another.</p>



<p>“Y-Yes.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Sowwy Nakaoka-teacher.”</p>



<p>“So sorry.”</p>



<p>“Gomenasorry.”</p>



<p>“What’s with that language? Are you really feeling sorry? …Well, no matter. Anyway the school festival is open to the general public, so a large number of people will come. If any complaints are made, and the vice principal or the principal hears about it, it will turn into a big problem. I might not be able to fully cover up for you either. Good grief… garter belts and bunny girls suit and whatnot… I don’t know where you gathered these from, but I’m confiscating it all,” Nakaoka said and crammed the numerous outfits into a cardboard box. “Then you’re all dismissed! Go enjoy other classes’ programs as a guest for the rest of the school festival!” she said, closed the door with a bang and left.</p>



<p>An awfully heavy silence befell the class, but… the number of people coming to terms with the reality of the program getting canceled increased with time, and one by one, they disappeared from the classroom.</p>



<p>Sandai and Shino were originally not so strongly interested in participating, so unlike other classmates, they were not discouraged.</p>



<p>Not in the least.</p>



<p>“Somehow… poof, the school festival ended just like that, didn&#8217;t it?”</p>



<p>“Nothing you can do about what’s gone spoiled. Let’s go check out other classes or the school year’s program, since we’re free and all.”</p>



<p>“Okay.”</p>



<p>When Sandai and Shino left the classroom as if nothing had happened, they heard the sorrowful cry of the class president from behind.</p>



<p>“UUUOOOOOOHHHH!!! IT WAS SUPPOSED TO BE A MEMORABLE SCHOOL FESTIVAL AND YEEEEEETTTT!!!”</p>



<p>The class president’s zeal for the school festival was certainly the real deal.</p>



<p>That was plain to see.</p>



<p>However, there was a limit to everything. Having lost one’s cool because ‘in essence it was the last school festival’ was not good.</p>



<p>Paying for one’s mistakes, in short… However, there was also a classmate who was worried about that class president. It was Takasago; she hurriedly rushed to the class president’s side.</p>



<p>If there was a lucky break from this cancellation, it would be that the relationship between Takasago and the class president might be taking another step forward. Being nestled up in times of sorrow is a classic recipe for kick-starting romance to move forward.</p>



<p>Since it would be best to not become a hindrance in such a time, Sandai decided to quietly leave them alone and began to tour around the school festival together with Shino.</p>



<p>One by one, they went around to see the program of each class in each school year. There were those running an exhibition of something, those performing a live concert or drama in the gymnasium; the school festival’s programs were diverse, and it was a school with a large number of students with many classes as well, so touring around was also a pain.</p>



<p>“I’m pooped~. Piggyback me~,” Shino said with her eyes turning into an X, seemingly tired from walking; easy to understand wanting to get spoiled.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Guess I’ve got no choice. Here.”</p>



<p>“Uww.”</p>



<p>He knew of this because he previously had also carried Shino on his back, but she was really light. Even Sandai, whose stamina and strength weren’t that much, didn’t get that much trouble with it.</p>



<p>Although Sandai got a boundless interest in Shino’s slender and soft body, like a healthy young man would, he nevertheless like last time tried not to enjoy the sensation.</p>



<p>Precisely because he didn’t openly express his desires, precisely because he didn’t think only of satisfying nothing but himself that Shino was fawning on him.</p>



<p>The only thing he wouldn’t want to do was any action that would betray that.</p>



<p>“Go~ go~.”</p>



<p>“Yeah yeah.”</p>



<p>“That doesn’t sound like a horsie’s neigh~.”</p>



<p>“Neighhihin. …Are you happy with this?”</p>



<p>“Good.”</p>



<p>The sight of him carrying Shino on his back was attracting attention in various senses, but inquisitive gazes and the like had always been showering them until now. Sandai had always been on the thick-skinned side, but he had become more so recently and was now in a position where he would no longer care about how others looked at him.</p>



<p>Sandai spotted a bench as he made his way through the gaps in the crowd, and then bent down to lower down Shino.</p>



<p>“Wee~ a chair spotted. Break time~.”</p>



<p>“I’m gonna go get some drinks from the vending machine. Anything you wanna drink?”</p>



<p>“I’m OK.”</p>



<p>“I want you to let me do boyfriend-like stuff, like taking action for my girlfriend. Besides… Now lately you’ve always been making lunch for me after all.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Thanks. Then I wanna drink milk tea! It should be there.”</p>



<p>“Roger.”</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>






<p>Clang, the milk tea fell down into the vending machine’s outlet with a clang. Sandai took it and leisurely made his way back.</p>



<p>That was when.</p>



<p>Weird voice could be heard coming from the school infirmary he just happened to pass by. Sandai spontaneously came to a stop.</p>



<p>“Pyo-Pyon.”</p>



<p>“Nakaoka-sensei… looks like there’s still embarrassment left in you. It’s not bunny-like.”</p>



<p>“No, imitating a rabbit in this outfit at this age indeed really is…”</p>



<p>“I’ve said it’s fine. It’s still totally do-able. We’re still just barely young people after all. Just barely.”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“Yup, that’s right. Thirty something women are youngsters, you know? …Now then, one more time with the mind of a true bunny. One, two, three—go!”</p>



<p>“Pyon!!”</p>



<p>There was a conversation that made him curious about what was happening inside, so Sandai quietly opened the school infirmary’s door.</p>



<p>In there, there was his homeroom teacher in a bunny girl suit. In rhythm to the clapping beat of the school nurse lady, his homeroom teacher put her hands on her head to make rabbit ears while shaking her butt, repeating, “Pyon. Pyon.”</p>



<p>“Nakaoka-sensei… what are you doing?” Sandai asked like to murmur while speechless.</p>



<p>Nakaoka and the school nurse looked back at the same time. The two women in their thirties froze as their eyes opened wide, and gradually sweat broke out on their foreheads.</p>


<img src="https://icantreadjapanese.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/j5dw2gv.jpg"></img>


<p>Gulp, Sandai swallowed down his saliva.</p>



<p>What Nakaoka was wearing was one of the clothes she’d taken away after scolding her students. And she had borrowed that willy-nilly and was imitating a rabbit.</p>



<p>“Sensei…”</p>



<p>“&#8230;P-Pyon. You’re mistaken-pyon. It’s just a little bunny here-pyon. There’s no woman called Nakaoka-pyon. Fujiwara-kun, you didn’t see anything-pyo… n.”</p>



<p>Sandai had a hunch that it would be better to pretend he hadn’t seen this.</p>



<p>Even Nakaoka was a person before she was a teacher, so she’d probably committed an error out of passing, sudden impulse. No mistaking that she hadn’t even thought that she would be witnessed by a student, moreover by one she herself was in charge of.</p>



<p>He could tell from seeing that shaken state of hers.</p>



<p>This was a situation where Nakaoka’s honor as a teacher and then, more than anything, Nakaoka’s dignity as a woman were being threatened, so this was a spectacle that should be forgotten if it were to protect those.</p>



<p>If it were someone who would think of crooked stuff like making others do as one pleases after obtaining some dirt on others, this would probably be a situation where they would say ‘I’ve got a good material’ in joy, but unfortunately Sandai wasn’t such a guy.</p>



<p>Besides, Sandai was also indebted to Nakaoka. He owed her one. Despite having witnessed Sandai and Shino kissing just recently, Nakaoka had read the mood and pretended to have not seen it.</p>



<p>Thinking that this was the perfect opportunity to return the favor, Sandai made a right about-face in a robot-like movement, stepped into the corridor, and slammed shut the school infirmary’s door.</p>



<p><em>“&#8230;That boy, is he a student from your class?”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;Yeah.”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;”</em></p>



<p><em>“You’ve been… seen, isn’t it?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Th-This is your fault! You made me do it!”</em></p>



<p><em>“It-It’s certainly me who recommended it, but the one who decided to do it was you, Nakaoka-sensei! You’re an adult so you’re responsible for your own act—”</em></p>



<p><em>“Shuddup shuddup shuddup! I don’t wanna hear excuses! In the first place what’s this perverted body even!? Huh?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Please stop~ don’t fondle it~.”</em></p>



<p>Sandai resolutely swore to himself that he would pretend to have not seen the whole thing. That being said, forgetting the scene just now was certainly also fairly hard.</p>



<p>It was such a shocking scene that even after returning to Shino’s side, the shocking image of Nakaoka in a bunny girl suit remained etched into Sandai’s mind and couldn’t go away.</p>



<p>However, he must forget it. Sandai shook his head and forcibly kicked Nakaoka out of his memory.</p>



<p>“&#8230;What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“I just kinda came across a big rabbit. It’s because of that.”</p>



<p>“Rabbit?”</p>



<p>“Nakao—nah, it’s nothing. That aside, here’s the milk tea.” Sandai swallowed down the name he’d almost blurted out without thinking, handed the milk tea, and sat down next to Shino.</p>



<p>Shino was tilting her head, but without making any attempt to ask about it in particular, maybe because Sandai was also making eyes like a dead fish, she put the can on her mouth and began to drink.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Dewicious.”</p>



<p>“Glad to hear that.”</p>



<p>“Yep. Thanks. …Wait, speaking of which, you didn’t buy one for yourself?”</p>



<p>“Just because I’m not that thirsty.”</p>



<p>It was not a lie and it was the truth that he wasn’t thirsty, but, “Nn.” Shino stopped drinking the milk tea halfway through and held it out to him. “&#8230;Let’s go halfsies. I already drank half so drink the rest.”</p>



<p>Sandai could’ve just refused and told her not to mind it, but Shino probably wouldn’t have agreed to that, so he took the offer. He gulped it down and threw away the now empty can into the garbage can for empty cans. Clang, the sound of the can falling echoed into the hallway.</p>



<p>The evening sun streaming into the hallway was about to begin to sink. The school festival was over, and the students were also starting to clean up.</p>



<p>Many classes went out for launching fireworks, an evening party, dinner, or karaoke and such. Sandai’s class as well, despite their program getting canceled, there were those who were finding their classmates still at school and passing such talk around.</p>



<p>But Sandai and Shino opted not to participate. After all, wanting to prioritize their time together was their reason.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Let’s go home.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yeah.”</p>



<p>Taking a stroll downtown, heading back to his apartment and chilling around together—after spending such a time together, Sandai went to walk Shino to the station.</p>



<p>And then, they kissed. After that he saw off the train and then checked the clock.</p>



<p>“Ten o’clock…”</p>



<p>When he thought about the time until the start of late night anime, he wondered whether he could do studying a little.</p>



<p>As Sandai left the station while yawning, his phone rang.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Is it Shino? Nah nope. It’s an SMS… who is it?”</p>



<p>He thought that it was perhaps a for-the-first-time-in-a-while message from his parents, but even if that was the case, it would show the name. As for this one, only the telephone number was shown. In other words, a message from someone not registered in his contact.</p>



<p>“Is this the kind of prank where they send a message to a random number?”</p>



<p>That was the first thing that popped up in his mind, but there was also a possibility that it was an urgent message from a government office or power company and such, so he checked the content just in case.</p>



<p>&gt;Don’t tell anyone what you saw in the school infirmary today. Please. I’ll do anything.</p>




<p>It was a message that immediately let him know who the sender was.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Sensei.”</p>



<p>As for how Nakaoka had got to know of Sandai’s number, probably through the contact information previously given. Due to the fact that his parents were overseas, Sandai had put in his own phone number on the class’ contact information. She had sent the message after taking a look at it.</p>



<p>Maybe it was embarrassing to talk directly from the fact that she had sent an SMS and not given a call. Well anyhow, Sandai sent, ‘I didn’t see anything, though.’</p>



<p>Although Sandai was unsure whether Nakaoka was perhaps relieved or perhaps sensed his tight-lippedness, no further reply came.</p>



<p>“Good grief.” Sandai shrugged his shoulders, but however, he received another message from someone else. Sandai’s phone was just so busy today. “What is it now…” He took a look at the sender as he groaned, and saw it was from the aquarium where he’d gotten a part-time job offer.</p>



<p>The content was about asking him to come next Sunday at 1 pm for the job’s detail explanation and training, and also an apology for contacting him at night.</p>



<p>“Next Sunday, huh…”</p>



<p>He would have no particular things to do on next Sunday, and Shino would also be working during the day. In other words, Sandai would be free during the day. He sent back his acknowledgement as he also got no reason to refuse.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>

style="height:50px;" aria-hidden="true" class="wp-block-spacer"></div>



<p>As Sandai was spending his days flirting with Shino without fail even with the limited time, next Sunday came in a flash. After confirming the time specified by his part-time job was drawing near, Sandai got ready and headed there.</p>



<p>It being Sunday, many people were walking down the street, so he was walking while being careful not to bump shoulders with other pedestrians.</p>



<p>Given that he had headed out with some time to spare, he arrived twenty minutes earlier than the specified time. Then he saw Hajime. “Fujiwara-kun!”</p>



<p>“Ah… It’s Saeki.”</p>



<p>Somehow feeling like he hadn’t seen Hajime for a long time, Sandai felt weirdly nostalgic. It hadn’t been that long since the interview, however…</p>



<p>“It sure feels like we haven’t met for about half a year.”</p>



<p>“Eh? It hasn’t been that long, you know? And the interview was just last week. Aww c’mon, a joke like that’s not funny.” Hajime ballooned up his cheeks and hung his head down while pouting his mouth.</p>



<p>It was a very sweet and cute gesture—but Hajime was a guy. Hajime looked like a girl no matter how you looked at it—but he was a guy.</p>



<p>“A boy<sup>femboy</sup> is not a man… but being a boy<sup>femboy</sup> is also another fact, huh.”</p>



<p>“W-What’s wrong? You’re talking weird… Is it philosophy or something?”</p>



<p>“I just thought the world’s full of wonders, you see.”</p>



<p>“Hmm. …By the way Fujiwara-kun, you didn’t contact me at all, huh?”</p>



<p>“Contact?”</p>



<p>“We’ve exchanged contact addresses, and yet you didn’t contact me at all, so I was feeling lonely, you know?”</p>



<p>“That’s an issue with my personality, I must say.”</p>



<p>“Do you like neglect-play?”</p>



<p>“Could it be you’re trying to tease me?”</p>



<p>“I don’t mean that, though…”</p>



<p>“Well look… you said about contacting, but I don’t know what I should do either here. At any rate, I was a complete loner until not that long ago. Instead of waiting for a contact from me, I want you to do it.”</p>



<p>“Somehow I just feel like I’ll lose if I&#8217;m the one contacting~.”</p>



<p>“You know it’s not even about winning or losing.”</p>



<p>As they were having such chit-chat, Omaki came out from the aquarium and called to them. “You two sure are quick. I’m so impressed.”</p>



<p>“Good morning!”</p>



<p>“Good mor… good morning?” Sandai tilted his head in puzzlement because Hajime had said ‘good morning’ even though it was noon.</p>



<p>And then, “Ahem!” Hajime puffed up his non-existent chest and began explaining. “In the service industry, it’s pretty much ‘good morning’ when you come in… I’m not really sure why, though.”</p>



<p>“Right, like Saeki-kun said, there sure are many places in the service industry where they say ‘good morning’ when they come to work. I don’t really know why either, though.”</p>



<p>Since the two people who got no particular point of contact with each other, Hajime and Omaki, were in agreement, it must be the so-called ‘common sense.’</p>



<p>“I see.” As Sandai was nodding his head in understanding, Omaki brought a brand new cardboard box.</p>



<p>“Well, setting aside the greeting’s origin… It’s today’s main topic. Now go change into this you two.”</p>



<p>There were work clothes with the aquarium’s logo and boots in the cardboard box. Although it gave Sandai such a feeling of, <em>I’m gonna start working for real, huh</em>, it seemed to be only him.</p>



<p>As for Hajime with his fair share of working experience, “Okay,” he took it without getting worked up.</p>



<p>“Hey hey, look at these work clothes, it’s got a dolphin picture on the back!”</p>



<p>“Sure they do.”</p>



<p>“The locker room… looks like over there. We’re gonna change together, huh?”</p>



<p>“Yeah su—”</p>



<p>—<em>re we are</em>.</p>



<p>Sandai had almost nodded his head following the flow, but he suddenly came to his senses.</p>



<p>Changing clothes together with Hajime… There was nothing to worry about as they were fellow men, but Sandai felt like it was somehow not right nevertheless.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’ll go get changed in the toilet.”</p>



<p>“W-Why? C’mon, let’s change together.”</p>



<p>“Just because.”</p>



<p>“Do you hate me…?”</p>



<p>“I don’t mean that, but how do I explain this… I’m just of the principle that likes to get changed alone,” Sandai gave some random excuse.</p>



<p>But despite getting slightly dispirited, “I see,” Hajime gave his understanding.</p>



<p>Sandai sure did feel strangely sorry, but he got a hunch that if they changed together, he’d learn of something serious—something he wasn’t supposed to know.</p>



<p>With the work clothes in one hand, Sandai hurried to the toilet and began to change. Although it took him slightly more time than expected due to him being strangely worked up, he pulled through somehow.</p>



<p>When Sandai got out into the hallway, Hajime was waiting with his back against the wall, apparently having finished changing ahead of Sandai.</p>



<p>“You were waiting for me? It’s not like you really have to…”</p>



<p>“Don’t go saying sad stuff like that. I want to get to know you better, Fujiwara-kun. …If you want, wanna link arms?”</p>



<p><em>Is linking arms a measurement of closeness between fellow men?</em> Sandai wasn’t really sure, but felt like it was wrong.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Is linking arms stuff fellow men do?”</p>



<p>“If they were close, even men would link arms, you know? You might not know as a loner, but that’s how it is these days, you know?”</p>



<p>“Is-Is that so?”</p>



<p>“Just jokin’! It’s just a joke. You’re so kyut, Fujiwara-kun.” Hajime smiled radiantly as if to say, Gotcha!</p>



<p>Hajime probably wasn’t aware of it, but the way he would tease people was exactly like a girl. When combined with the looks, it made Hajime like a perfect beautiful girl that of men’s ideals, so Sandai somehow understood now the feelings of those people wanting to make Hajime wear a girl’s outfit by all means.</p>



<p>Well, that aside, they returned to Omaki since they were done changing, and then were handed a paper outlining the work procedure, a brazier, and a garbage bag.</p>



<p>“So about the work’s procedure, or I should say training… There&#8217;s nothing that requires that much proficiency. Just carry on as written on this paper and you’re all OK. No special skills or techniques required whatsoever!”</p>



<p>There was also a section of ‘cleaning with running water’ that seemed to require some knowledge, but there was also a note that a supervisor would give an instruction on this. It seemed there was no need to think complicatedly.</p>



<p>“For now, the goal for today is to have you get the hang of it, so let’s take it easy. Of course, I’ll make sure today’s time is counted as your work time, too. Now then, let’s start by picking up trash around the area.”</p>



<p>The trash picking went smoothly without any particular problems showing up, but they encountered a forkroad not long after, so they had to split up into three groups.</p>



<p>Beyond the forked path, Sandai leisurely and calmly went to pick up the trash. He simply was going about it the same like when studying—not slacking by any means.</p>



<p>This kind of steady work would bring results when done steadily and without haste. In fact, his bag got full in no time at all as he was calmly picking up trash one by one without missing a single piece.</p>



<p>When Sandai returned to the aquarium, Hajime and Omaki weren’t there, apparently first to arrive. The two returned about ten minutes later.</p>



<p>“You’re so quick, Fujiwara-kun…”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Looks like it took a bit of time for me and Saeki-kun. Well, boys are different in the way they move and their stamina, so it can’t be helped if things don’t go the same way, though.”</p>



<p>“I’m a boy, too…”</p>



<p>“R-Right, of course, Saeki-kun is also a boy. Th-That’s right, now let’s start sorting out the garbage we’ve collected, shall we?” Omaki opened the opening of the garbage bags to gloss over her careless remark, and quickly walked closer to Sandai next. “Hey… Fujiwara-kun, I think you realized after trying it out for a bit, but you think cleaning is a plain work, don’t you?”</p>



<p>There was an examining-feel to Omaki’s tone; or rather, feeling like she was worried to be told, ‘I knew it, I don’t want to do this.’</p>



<p>Cleaning job was, just like Omaki had pointed out before, plain. But not all youngsters would avoid it, and Sandai had applied for it precisely because it was a cleaning job in the first place.</p>



<p>“Personally, I think this kind of job is pretty interesting too, you know?” Sandai stated matter-of-factly, making Omaki stop looking worried and look bashful.</p>



<p>“&#8230;You’re right. There are many young people who think only whether or not they can do flashy activities, but it doesn’t mean a plain but necessary work like this isn’t interesting, isn’t it. Looks like you’ll become a man who got himself together, Fujiwara-kun. Maybe Onee-san should make her claim?”</p>



<p>It was probably just a simple joke, but it would get troublesome in the unlikely event that it wasn’t. So immediately, “I have already been claimed so please stop,” Sandai politely declined it.</p>



<p>“You’ve already been claimed? Hmm, so you have a girlfriend?” Omaki was very doubtful, apparently thinking for Sandai to have a girlfriend to be unexpected, perhaps because she saw him as ‘plain.’</p>



<p>“What is it with those looks, I really do have a girlfriend.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;What’s she like?”</p>



<p>“Is it like, I have to speak no matter what?”</p>



<p>“Maybe you really don’t have one?”</p>



<p>“I’m saying I have…”</p>



<p>“Then tell me.”</p>



<p><em>Always getting doubted will also be bothersome</em>, having thought so Sandai gave up and showed Omaki Shino’s picture he got on his phone.</p>



<p>“It’s this girl.”</p>



<p>“Uwah! A super beauty… I guess I&#8217;ve got no chance if she’s like this~.” Although he couldn’t tell whether it was a joke because of the light tone, in any case, Omaki’s interest seemed to have subsided from learning about Shino’s existence. “Haaah… Onee-san wants a boyfriend, though.”</p>



<p>“Although I don’t know your age, Omaki-san, you seem to have passed the age of majority at least, and so aiming for high school boys just sounds so…”</p>



<p>“I’m not that old, you know? I’m still 28.”</p>



<p>“It’s about ten years apart, you know…?”</p>



<p>“Ahaha,” Omaki laughed and glossed it over, but there was a hint of regret in those eyes of hers. It appeared she wouldn’t ask any more weird questions.</p>



<p>Thereafter, while making a lap around the premise, they were lightly taught how to clean each place.</p>


<p>“&#8230;This is all for the training. I don’t think there’s anything else in particular. I’ll contact you later for your provisional shift, so if there’s any issues just let me know at that time. Then you can take your leave now!”</p>



<p>Having said their leave to Omaki who was wiping her forehead, seeming to want to say ‘hard work done,’ Sandai and Hajime changed back into their plain clothes and went outside. Of course, they changed in separate places.</p>



<p>As Sandai was about to leave while letting out a yawn, “Wait a minute,” Hajime called to him. “Hey Fujiwara-kun, so I heard your talk with Omaki-san earlier.”</p>



<p>“My talk with Omaki-san…?”</p>



<p>“Yep. So you have a girlfriend?”</p>



<p>“Aah, that one. You heard it, huh. Well, I do.”</p>



<p>“I heard she&#8217;s super beautiful, though? Show me, too!” Hajime clung to Sandai’s arm and begged.</p>



<p>Well, It wouldn’t make sense either not showing it to Hajime yet having showed it to Omaki. It would be like being given unfair treatment, which should hurt Hajime’s feelings as well.</p>



<p>“It’s this girl.”</p>



<p>Hajime went, “Wah!” when Sandai showed Hajime Shino’s picture. “&#8230;I mean she’s cuter than a model or idol, could she be Yuizaki Shino-san?”</p>



<p>“You know her?”</p>



<p>“She’s super famous, you know? Even at my school someone will always bring her up. …Yuizaki-san doesn’t seem to have any SNS, and it’s impossible to get into contact with her in any way, and so there are many guys who feel she’s sort of like someone with even more rarity value.”</p>



<p>“She certainly did say she hates getting weird DMs so she doesn’t do SNS.”</p>



<p>“I see now. …But, how did you meet Yuizaki-san who’s got such a high guard?”</p>



<p>“We go to the same school.”</p>



<p>“Ah… I get it now. If that’s the case, it sure looks like you can get to know each other directly.”</p>



<p>A small breeze suddenly came, and a sweet and soft smell drifted from Hajime. It had the same smell as Shino’s.</p>



<p>“The smell just now…”</p>



<p>“Yeah?”</p>



<p>“No, I just thought something smelled good is coming from you, Saeki.”</p>



<p>“Something smelled good? Maybe it’s my scented hand cream? Here, try taking a little sniff.” When Sandai sniffed the back of the hand Hajime was holding out, there was indeed where the smell came from. “This is a new product from JILL. It&#8217;s a go-to high end cosmetic brand. They’ve got a lot of packaging with cute designs, so they’re popular for presents and stuff.”</p>



<p>Putting aside for now as to why Hajime, a guy, was using a cosmetic for girls, Sandai reacted with a start at the ‘popular for presents and stuff’ part.</p>



<p>He remembered the underwear he’d bought to give to Shino for Christmas. Although already this late, he felt it was somehow weird about underwear as a present.</p>



<p>“Popular for presents…”</p>



<p>“They are.”</p>



<p>“By some chance, could it be popular for presents for, like, Christmas or birthdays?”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I see. So by the way…”</p>



<p>“What’s up?”</p>



<p>“If a girl was given something like underwear as a present, what would she think? Moreover a pretty lewd one.”</p>



<p>“Eh? Ah… right… probably depends on the girl’s personality, but… I think they’d get bewildered normally. No, I mean thinking normally would you give it as a present? I think you can understand it if you try thinking about it in their position, though. For example, what would you think if you got a weirdly obscene underwear for men as a present from Yuizaki-san?”</p>



<p>“I think… I… would question what she’s thinking.”</p>



<p>“Right? It&#8217;s the same thing.”</p>



<p>A gush of unpleasant sweat broke out all over Sandai’s body.</p>



<p>It was an underwear he had bought with the momentum from having been taken in by Miki, but even without giving it much thought, Miki got a cheeky personality.</p>



<p>‘It was a lot of fun, and Miki was satisfied, too.’</p>



<p>Only now did he understand the reason for Miki to quickly go home after saying so. Just imagining what would happen later on was already irresistibly fun.</p>



<p>He was late to notice it.</p>



<p>But he didn’t even have the monetary surplus to buy another present now. The current Sandai could only pray ‘Please don’t think of me as a “pervert”.’</p>



<p>Sandai’s steps became heavy with his mood beginning to darken as well, but Hajime went to cheer Sandai up.</p>



<p>Hajime smacked Sandai on the back. “Come! On!”</p>



<p>“Uwwh… what’s with the sudden…”</p>



<p>“I don’t really get it, but is it like you screwed up in choosing the present? It’s gonna be fine, I’m sure.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;On what basis?”</p>



<p>“Girls are unexpectedly more broad-minded than guys, you know? The fact that you’re dating means she must like you, too. That’s why it’s gonna be fine. Even if the guy a girl likes or is interested in is a little weird, she’ll forgive him. She’ll think, ‘it can’t be helped’ ‘he’s also cute like that.’ Because that’s just how it is.”</p>



<p>It was a mystery that Hajime, a guy, understood even the deep parts of a woman’s heart, but Sandai somewhat got cheered up nevertheless. His heart quickly felt light.</p>



<p>“Thanks,” Sandai said with a smile, only to get stared fixedly by Hajime. Those large eyes of his with seemingly dilated pupils were moist.</p>



<p>It was eyes… that seemed to suck people in.</p>



<p>When Sandai unconsciously stared back, Hajime made a right about-face with a twirl.</p>



<p>“Don’t mention it. Fufu… You’re so kyut, Fujiwara-kun. Then see you,” he said, and left without haste while waving his hand.</p>



<p>Sandai was motionlessly staring at Hajime’s back, but he finally noticed it would be almost time for Shino to be done with her part-time job.</p>



<p>Today was Sunday. Shino’s work would end at six in the evening. Sandai checked the time on his phone, and it was 5:45.</p>



<p>Sandai ran as it seemed he wouldn’t make it if he hadn’t, and he arrived at the cafe five minutes earlier, somehow worth the effort.</p>



<p>“Hn? Shino-chan’s BF-kun has arrived at the store.”</p>



<p>“Hello.”</p>



<p>“Now this way, come.”</p>



<p>When he sat at the most inconspicuous seat where he was led to, he was immediately served black tea of the boyfriend’s privilege. Sandai drank up the slightly steaming black tea in one go. And then Shino in her plain clothes came out from the back.</p>



<p>“Yoohoo.”</p>



<p>“Nn.”</p>



<p>“Then let’s go back.”</p>



<p>Once they stepped outside the store, a cold wind blew through the gaps between buildings.</p>



<p>“&#8230;The wind just now was so cold.”</p>



<p>“You’re right.”</p>



<p>Sandai stuck to Shino closer than usual and held that hand of hers.</p>



<p>Shino’s hand was slightly chilly, but as he continued to grasp it, warmth gradually spread out which was comforting.</p>



<p>On their way to his apartment, Sandai casually looked at Shino’s profile.</p>



<p>He’d been cheered up by Hajime, and his heart had gotten slightly lighter even, but nevertheless, he got not zero worries—about how she would respond when receiving the Christmas present.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“No… umm…”</p>



<p>“Ah, I know! Just a sec!” Shino fished through her bag and pulled out a muffler from inside, and then wrapped half of it around her neck, and the other half around Sandai’s neck. “Your neck was cold, right? With this it’s warm, right?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You’re right. It really is warm.”</p>



<p>“Right, right.”</p>



<p>Sandai smiled. He got taken aback somewhat.</p>



<p>Then he noticed.</p>



<p>Shino was a kind girl who would worry about him in many ways like this, at the very least he got the confidence that she was a girlfriend who wouldn’t get mad.</p>



<p>As for the present… he would just have to pay attention next time. That was all what he’d have to do.</p>



<p>“W-What’s with that very gentle face?”</p>



<p>“It’s nothing.”</p>



<p>“Really…? Somehow you’re looking like a Buddha statue, though. Are you saying that’s my imagination?”</p>



<p>“You’re right, it’s your imagination. …Hmm?” Suddenly Sandai’s phone rang. He got a message. “It’s a message.”</p>



<p>“From who?”</p>



<p>“Who knows. I’ll check now.”</p>



<p>The sender was his father, and the content was a brief ‘How have you been lately?’</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s from Dad. Sure is rare.”</p>



<p>“Your dad, huh~.”</p>



<p>“It says to give a status report here. I can’t really ignore this. I’ve been allowed to live alone after all.”</p>



<p>“Also write about me, okay?”</p>



<p>“I definitely will, or I should say that’ll be the main point. I want to keep it as short as possible, though…”</p>



<p>“You sure are pretty bad with long sentences aren’t you, Sandai. Even now I still remember how you only sent me your name in your first message, you know? Actually I’ve got the message history on me, wanna see? Hmm?”</p>



<p>“N-No, it’s fine.”</p>



<p>“You sure?”</p>



<p>“I’m sure. …That aside, just how I should write it.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Instead of weirdly thinking so much, can’t you just use your feelings? Honest words just how you felt it are most natural and resonates with the heart; either in writing or in speech. At the very least I’m like that.”</p>



<p>“I see…”</p>



<p>Sandai typed the words without giving it much thought, just as Shino told him. And then it turned out better than expected.</p>



<p>Getting liked by Shino and them dating, afterwards completely getting hooked on romance—Sandai promptly sent the message that looked like it could fully convey such a current situation of his.</p>





<p>&gt;The gyaru<sup>ぎゃる</sup> sitting behind me liked me. Might be no hope for me anymore.</p>



<p>“Ng…”</p>



<p>After sending it Sandai realized; that he had forgotten to convert gyaru<sup>ぎゃる </sup>to gyaru<sup>ギャル</sup> and sent the message with it still in hiragana.</p>



<p>“&#8230;What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Forgot to convert. The gyaru<sup>ギャル </sup>is still in hiragana.”</p>



<p>“That’s fine, isn’t it? Hiragana is rounder and it’s cuter,” said Shino</p>



<p>“I guess that’s true,” Sandai agreed and put his phone away.</p>
