<h3>Prologue.</h3>

<p>“&#8230;C’mon, don’t look here.”</p>



<p>“I hear you, but the sight of you gloriously plunging your foot into the gutter is just so eye-catching.”</p>



<p>“I-I didn’t do it because I wanted to! Aaah geez, this is the worst! I have a part-time after this and no way I’m going there while stinking of the ditch… and I’ve got dirt splattered over my uniform and arms, too…”</p>



<p>“Part-time? From when?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;It starts at 5.”</p>



<p>“You still have about one hour and a half there. How about heading home first?”</p>



<p>“Huh? It takes me an hour to get home by train each way, alright? I’m not gonna make it!”</p>



<p>“I see, that’s certainly unreasonable. Let’s see… wanna come to my place? It’s the apartment right over there. I can lend you a shower, at least.”</p>



<p>“Eh…?”</p>



<p>“What do you say?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’ll borrow your shower. Thanks.”</p>



<p>This was the first time Fujiwara Sandai had ever exchanged words with Yuizaki Shino.</p>



<p>On his way home from school just after the start of the second semester in early September, he happened to see Shino missing her footing and plunging into a ditch filled with dirty sewage water.</p>




<p>At the high school Sandai was attending, there was a gyaru considered to be an extraordinary beauty—and it was Yuizaki Shino, the one he’d just spoken to.</p>



<p>Shino was seated right behind Sandai, and the physical distance between them was very close. However, throughout their school life, Sandai had never had a single conversation with Shino.</p>



<p>From the point of view of Sandai who was someone ordinary with many otaku-like hobbies and a loner at the bottommost end of the class caste, Shino was pretty much an extraterrestrial existence to him; even when passing print-outs from the front to the back, never had he talked to her because he didn’t know what she was even thinking.</p>



<p>This wasn’t the outcome of a conscious decision, rather an unconscious segregation of ‘because the worlds they were living in were different.’</p>



<p>However, it was for this reason that Sandai had got surprised at himself suddenly getting talked to; nor could he believe that Shino had readily accepted his proposal.</p>



<p>However, there is a word called ‘coincidence’ in this world. That was why Sandai thought, <em>That must be what is happening now</em>.</p>
