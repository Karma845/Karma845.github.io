<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>Having gone through the few remaining days left of the winter holiday, the third semester finally arrived.</p>



<p>Similar to the end-of-term ceremony, the opening ceremony was full of students not paying attention. After that was done, students went back to their classes to have homeroom.</p>



<p>As for Sandai, the thing talked went in one ear and out the other.</p>



<p>Because he couldn’t break the habit of thinking that most events had nothing to do with him, anything other than tests related wouldn’t really enter his head.</p>



<p>Thus together with Shino, who similarly also had weak interest in any events, he made origami from torn notebook paper and showed it to each other.</p>



<p>“I made a crane~.”</p>



<p>“I made a dinosaur.”</p>



<p>“W-Wait hold on, how did you make that?”</p>



<p>“So you go like this…”</p>



<p>And at that time, bang! someone strongly hit a desk. When everyone turned to look wondering just what was happening, there was the Prez there deeply lowering his head.</p>



<p>“It’s sudden, but there is something I haven’t told all of you… I hope you will forgive me with this apology.”</p>



<p>It seemed just like an apology press conference of a politician having done corruption, but in this place no one knew just what the apology was for, so everyone was puzzled.</p>



<p>“Prez…?”</p>



<p>“What’s this suddenly, Prez.”</p>



<p>“What now so suddenly? What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>With a hoarse, squeezed-out like voice, Prez said, “&#8230;It’s regarding the destination for the school trip in March, but the truth is that only our class hasn’t made any decision.”</p>



<p>The whole class stiffened up at those brief words.</p>



<p>“It’s a school trip where the destination is decided by the class, but… of all things, I have ended up forgetting it… and missing the opportunity to talk about it.”</p>



<p>Prez had his glasses taken off and wiped his tears.</p>



<p>Silence fell in the classroom. However, finally, the students’ gaze fixed on Nakaoka, their homeroom teacher.</p>



<p>“Haaah…” At first not realizing she was being stared at, Nakaoka was absentmindedly gazing out the window for a short period and sighed.</p>



<p>However, once a short time passed and she noticed the stares, cold sweat broke out of her forehead, and she began to talk her way out.</p>



<p>“H-Hey, wait you guys, I found out at the staff meeting this morning that only our class hasn’t made any decision yet… I also got considerably scolded by the principal. So don’t look at me like you’re accusing me. I got my share of scolding already.”</p>



<p>She hadn’t seemed this panicked ever since Sandai had witnessed her in a bunny girl suit, and from the way she acted, it was clear to see that she had been rather harshly scolded by the principal.</p>



<p>Incidentally, although obvious, there had been a proper reason as to why <em>no one had noticed</em>.</p>



<p>The school trip, as a matter of fact, had been in the minds of both Nakaoka and Prez until shortly after the start of the second semester.</p>



<p>However, the events happening thereafter had been a problem.</p>



<p>And as for what it had been, it had been the rumor between Sandai and Shino, and the no-pause thereafter shocking announcement of them dating.</p>



<p>Preoccupied with this development that had sent a shock to every corner, and had ended up forgetting it—how it had happened.</p>



<p>And then just like that they had entered winter holiday.</p>



<p>Among the students in this class, there were also those who had noticed like, “Huh, come to think of it,” when the topic about the school trip had come up in a casual conversation with friends in another class or club activities, but…</p>



<p>They would ignore it like so: <em>but it’s weird none of my classmates pointed it out, so maybe we’ve decided it and I just forgot about it</em>.</p>



<p>Like a domino toppling or Pythagora Switch, it had beautifully created the trend where no would talk about the school trip that had come lasting till this point.</p>



<p>And as for Sandai and Shino who had been the main cause of this situation, they didn’t notice that they had been one, and were looking as though it was someone else’s problem like: <em>somehow it’s turned into something serious, huh</em>.</p>
