<h3>Chapter 2: 5 December – 10 December The Prez Is a Smooth Man, Huh?</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Without anything in particular occurring, Sandai’s daily lives were going fine. By starting a part-time job, it had become busy just a little, but it was as usual otherwise.</p>



<p>After the end of the finals, he had put on hold walking Shino all the way to her home.</p>



<p>To have that included in his daily lives, Sandai was thinking that it would be after properly greeting her parents.</p>



<p>Right now, little by little, he was in the middle of getting his mental preparations done for that.</p>



<p>In the meantime, entering December, and after several passing days, the result of the finals finally came back.</p>



<p>Speaking of whether or not Shino managed to avoid failing… she somehow managed to barely avoid failing in all subjects. The person in question looked happy and had a big smile.</p>



<p>“I did it!”</p>



<p>“The results of your hard work, it is.”</p>



<p>On a further note, for Sandai’s results, it was above 90 in all subjects.</p>



<p>He did feel like he could’ve gotten a full mark on everything if so inclined, but he had dropped his scores so the first place in the school year could get taken by the class president, so he settled for this score.</p>



<p>Since the rank was disclosed personally as schools were also strict with personal information nowadays, it wasn’t definite that the Prez had actually taken the first… well, the said person was delightfully disclosing it to the surroundings, so it was definite without Sandai having to force his hand to find out.</p>







<p><em>“UWOOOOHHH, F-FINALLY FIRST PLACE! I’VE ACHIEVED IT!!</em></p>



<p><em>“Shut up, Prez. Yeah sure, good for you, huh.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Someone like Prez will raise the average, which also raises the failing mark. Drop your score in the spirit of solidarity, man.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Shihouin-kun is first place… Speaking of which, Shihouin-kun’s birthday is also close. I wanna give some kind of present to congratulate his birthday and for getting first place… I wanna get to know him, too…”</em></p>



<p><em>“Yuizaki somehow avoids failing this final, doesn&#8217;t she? Even though she’s always been a supplementary class regular in all subjects. I wonder if Fujiwara is good at helping study.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I got betrayed by Shino… I thought we were supplementary class forever best buds and yet…”</em></p>



<p><em>“The greatest dummy avoiding failing feels, like, the greatest betrayal. I get you.”</em></p>



<p><em>“The supplementary class starts on the 24th on winter holiday’s first day, so as expected on that day Shino also wants to… so that’s what this is all about, right? It’s the power of love.”</em></p>







<p>In the classroom, here and there people who had ended up failing were standing out. Somehow it seemed to be a lot, however…</p>



<p>The failing mark was based on the average of the entire school year, so it seemed there were a lot of students with bad results in this class.</p>



<p>That said, there were also top ranker students such as Sandai and the Prez.</p>



<p>If we were to take the average by dividing the collective score of the whole class, we would probably get a balance figure.</p>



<p>Glancing at the students’ louder than usual pandemonium, the homeroom teacher Nakaoka let out a sigh. And then for some reason, Nakaoka looked at Sandai.</p>



<p>“Alright… The results have been given back, and now there is a student I have to summon for a bit. Fujiwara, come to the staff room after school.”</p>



<p>“Eh…?”</p>



<p>Suddenly being named, Sandai opened his eyes wide in puzzlement.</p>



<p>“There’s something I want to talk about.”</p>



<p>Sandai was about to ask what it was about, but Shino, however, responded even faster than him.</p>



<p>“Sandai is smart enough to help me study, his results aren&#8217;t bad, and he hasn’t done anything weird either… So why does he need to be summoned?”</p>



<p>“Why are you the one responding and not Fujiwara, Yuizaki… oh well, I guess that’s fine. Well, look, I’m not necessarily summoning him to scold him. Relax.”</p>



<p>“Then isn’t it fine to talk about it here?”</p>



<p>At the same time as Shino glaring at Nakaoka, tension spread out in the classroom, and the classmates who had been making ruckus until just now suddenly went silent.</p>



<p>Sandai also froze up reflexively at the sudden explosive situation between Shino and Nakaoka.</p>



<p>“It’s not something I can talk about here. It’s not anything weird.”</p>



<p>“If it’s not anything weird, then isn’t it strange that you can’t talk about it here?”</p>



<p>“I’m not going to bully your boyfriend either.”</p>



<p>“Then I’ll tag along.”</p>



<p>“I don’t know what you’re worried about, but there are other teachers in the staff room. Nothing that will worry you will happen. It’s like a student and teacher meeting.”</p>



<p>Student and teacher meeting—with words that could happen to any students equally coming out, perhaps her worry having been dispelled a little, Shino’s vigor gradually eased.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Like a student and teacher meeting?”</p>



<p>“That’s right. So don’t make such a scary face… Have you calmed down a bit?”</p>



<p>“It’s not like I’m being hysterical or anything.”</p>



<p>“You’re right, you just got worried a bit… When you fall in love with someone, you will make tremendous assumptions that will also turn into worry. That being the case, that’s the so-called emotion which is an important part of being a human. However, don&#8217;t let it run wild too much. Fujiwara is unexpectedly thick skinned, so he doesn’t seem to think anything of it at all, but that also perhaps will change someday.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;That’s not true.”</p>



<p>“Such a childish logic won’t get you anywhere once you become an—no, I guess it’s fine for now. Anyway, it’s great that I seem to have gotten your understanding.”</p>



<p>It seemed that the situation had settled down without turning serious, and everyone in that place including Sandai let out a sigh in unison.</p>



<p>It was a scene overflowing with tension.</p>



<p>In the worst scenario, Sandai had thought of giving a helping hand to Shino, but on one hand, he could understand why Nakaoka had chided Shino, so Sandai had mixed feelings.</p>



<p>Nakaoka’s point was correct.</p>



<p>Thinking about the time when Shino would be an adult, she had a little part of herself somewhere that would have to be fixed.</p>



<p>Nonetheless, there would be no meaning if Shino didn’t realize and try to fix it herself.</p>



<p>What Sandai could do would be to just support Shino from the shadows so she could realize it. Sandai thought that going further than that would simply be being pushy, nothing more.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>After school. When Sandai headed to the staff room, he found Nakaoka sipping a coffee looking awfully displeased.</p>



<p>“You’re finally here. Good grief… she sure is like a mad dog, that Yuizaki. Make sure you put a collar on her.”</p>



<p>“An act that has an issue with ethics and morals is a bit…”</p>



<p>“I’m not telling you to actually do it. It’s just a metaphor, alright?”</p>



<p>“And so, what do you want to talk about with me?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You helped Yuizaki study, someone who regularly has failed tests, and made her pass, right? Helping someone study looks easy but is difficult. Not everyone can do it, and as a homeroom teacher, it is good that a student with bad grades didn’t fail. Well done—I thought I’d let you know that… Well, your results on the other hand dropped a bit and it caught my eyes, but there was a clear trace of you trying to lower your scores like leaving the answers blank. Don’t know what kind of intention you have, but nevertheless, your scores averaged above 90 still. There’s nothing for me to say.”</p>



<p>“U-Uhuh… In short, does it mean that you just wanted to tell me ‘well done’ regarding me helping Shino study?”</p>



<p>To be summoned only for that was kind of a bummer. Sandai tilted his head puzzlingly. And immediately Nakaoka cleared her throat.</p>



<p>“W-Well, just now was a bit of a preface, you see. So the main topic is, umm, about me doing that with that, and then about the SMS I’ve sent you after the school festival…”</p>



<p>Sandai grasped it before Nakaoka could finish saying it all. The true essence of the talk and why Nakaoka had wanted to summon him was about that matter which he had decided to forget.</p>



<p>Sandai had clearly played dumb at that time—for the sake of conveying his stance to Nakaoka for certain.</p>



<p>However, Nakaoka seemed to be holding slight worry nevertheless, and wanted to personally ascertain Sandai’s response.</p>



<p>“That with that…? What is that about? Regarding the school festival, I remember that only our class’s program was canceled during the event, but other than that, I don’t think I remember anything else,” Sandai told her while looking away.</p>



<p>And then like a mix of relief and joy, like a small child not getting scolded after making a mistake if we were to liken it, Nakaoka made such a carefree smile.</p>



<p>“Oh I sure do love a man who can read the room like you. How about moving on from Yuizaki to me? I’m still single after all.”</p>



<p>“That’s a bit…”</p>



<p>“I’m just joking. As if with a student… In the first place, I don’t have any interest in a younger man and by twelve years even. Besides, Yuizaki should be quite the jealous type. Now matter how you look at it, it’s completely obvious it would become troublesome. I don’t have a hobby of risking my neck after all. I also do want to avoid getting into a situation where she would scream like, ‘YOU HOMEWRECKER!’ and then STAB! Haha.”</p>



<p>“No matter how jealous Shino is, she won’t do anything like that. Just what do you think my girlfriend is…”</p>



<p>Despite denying Nakaoka’s claim, Sandai did think, <em>no, that’s possible maybe</em>, as well.</p>



<p>Shino wasn’t good at studying, and she had a frank personality, but even so she possessed many ordinary aspects as well. However, regarding situations involving jealousy, she would take actions that would seem like one wrong move, and she would lose control.</p>



<p>Like how she had lashed out at Nakaoka earlier.</p>



<p>“Well, the inner workings of emotions do get intense in all sorts of ways when you’re young. Yuizaki is especially susceptible to this. Only a man who can look ahead and be considerate like you sure is fit to be her boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“I’m not a man who can be that considerate, you know? I’m just giving my all because if Shino is happy, I’m also happy.”</p>



<p>“I see now. And so, you think you can ease Yuizaki’s misandry somewhat?”</p>



<p>“Concerning that… I think it will take time, since she seems to also have a traumatic past. She herself has talked to me about it, and she said something like how she had gotten sick of boys watching her unexpectedly large chest in swimming class in the past. She is cute already, so I think she stood out even more, and it seems she is more emotionally wounded than I thought. When I think about how so that it wouldn’t put a burden on her, I would say it&#8217;s impossible for it to be immediate.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;So choosing a method that requires patience, huh. What a gentle way of handling it. I think it’s so like you, if I do say so myself. Somehow I envy Yuizaki a little now. I want to come across a partner who is that gentle as well. I do have no small amount of desire for marriage after all.”</p>



<p>“That’s unexpected. I thought that you are the type who dislikes having your own time shaved off from having a partner, marriage, or something like that.”</p>



<p>“I don’t look like it, but I’m someone who gets lonely pretty easily, you see. It’d be great if there’s a nice person, but I couldn’t easily find one, and now I’m in my thirties.”</p>



<p>Although not to the extent of Shino, Nakaoka was on the good-looking side. Her personality did have a preachy side, but that was not at all bad, though…</p>



<p>Could she have a high ideal, simply hadn’t been blessed with an encounter, or perhaps had a peculiar hobby that would put off anyone who got to know it?</p>



<p>Anyhow, Nakaoka shouldn’t find it amusing to have someone younger talk to her with know-it-all airs, so Sandai gave an inoffensive compliment.</p>



<p>“&#8230;There hadn’t been a single man with discerning eyes it seems. It hurts my heart that a wonderful woman like you is being ignored, Sensei.”</p>



<p>“Your delivery is so flat that it doesn’t move me, but umm well, <em>thanks,</em> for trying to encourage me.”</p>



<p>At the same time as Nakaoka showing a dry smile, the sunlight coming from the window got stronger just a little. Then, Sandai noticed a slight cheek blusher under Nakaoka’s eyes.</p>



<p>Given the vague impression, he thought that Nakaoka wasn’t wearing any make-up, but she seemed to be wearing light make-up so natural that you would have to take a close look to be able to tell.</p>



<p>Often looking at Shino, who would usually put effort to get cuter, Sandai understood that that was the result of being proficient at make-up.</p>



<p>And then, he realized Nakaoka’s weak point as well.</p>



<p>“It’s not my place to say it, but you seem to be proficient at light make-up, Nakaoka-sensei. But that being the case, I wonder if there are lots of men who wouldn’t notice when you are tired, dispirited, and such then.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;What’s with this so suddenly?”</p>



<p>“I’m just saying what I have in mind, so I would appreciate it if you could let it not bother you. It’s just, when a woman is dispirited, exhausted and such, there are many men who will have their desire to protect stimulated… Since that’s the case, I wonder if not hiding it and showing it on the face when you are tired would—”</p>



<p>Sandai thought he was being as tactful as possible with his words, but even Nakaoka really didn’t find it fun to get pointed out by someone younger it seemed—as she raised her eyebrows in irritation.</p>



<p>“—I know that much without you telling me. However, I’m not a fan of that sort of thing. That’s why I’m simply waiting for someone who would notice that personality of mine to show up!”</p>



<p>“I-I’m sorry, I have said something unnecessary.”</p>



<p>Although Sandai hurriedly lowered his head, Nakaoka’s breathing was violent, clearly in a bad mood.</p>



<p>There are several ways of dealing with someone when you have angered them, but among those, one that can be done amicably is to leave the scene. Once the creature called human has gotten into the state of being angry, even things that normally wouldn’t bother them could get them extremely angry.</p>



<p>“Umm… So… I will take my leave now then.”</p>



<p>Sandai slowly turned on his heel, and tried to quietly leave the staff room while having Nakaoka’s glare-like gaze piercing his back.</p>



<p>Then, Nakaoka’s glare-like gaze stopped. Without thinking, Sandai looked back. His eyes met with Nakaoaka’s, who was smiling wryly with an exasperated look.</p>



<p>“&#8230;No different from ten years ago. Still the same rude kid as ever. And he doesn’t even remember me. Well, I don’t have an interest in someone younger either, so it’s just whatever, though.”</p>



<p>Nakaoka was muttering something, but he would hate to anger her again by asking back without thinking. Not having a hobby of taking pleasure from getting scolded, Sandai just got out to the corridor while giving a slight bow to the school nurse who just happened to enter the staff room.</p>







<p><em>“The kid just now, I think he’s Nakaoka-sensei’s… wait, huh? Nakaoka-sensei, what happened? You’re making a weird look.”</em></p>



<p><em>“O-Oh? What’s this suddenly… Actually, is it fine to leave the infirmary empty?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I came here to grab some documents~. Besides, it’s already after school, and not a single sick student came in today, so it’s okay for me to leave for a bit.”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;I see.”</em></p>



<p><em>“That aside, you’re really making a weird look, what happened?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I’m always looking like this, and you know that.”</em></p>



<p><em>“That’s not true. Nakaoka-sensei… did someone catch your interest? Ah, I know! It’s the math teacher Takebayashi-sensei! I mean he’s pretty hot like a sauna.”</em></p>



<p><em>“If you don’t joke in moderation, I’m gonna get mad, you know?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Eeek~ I’ll quickly grab the documents and get baack~.”</em></p>






<p>Immediately after getting out into the corridor, Sandai found Shino waiting for him.</p>



<p>Sandai had thought that she was no longer at school since she had her part-time job, but she seemed to be concerned about him getting summoned.</p>



<p>“&#8230;What was the talk about?”</p>



<p>They had had a talk about Shino—though since he couldn’t tell the truth, Sandai decided to give it some cover up.</p>



<p>There are also times when it is better to lie.</p>



<p>“What it was about? Just that, like lecturing and stuff. Me getting summoned basically for that.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Sensei, you liar. She said she wasn’t going to bully you, yet lecturing.”</p>



<p>“Well, sometimes I’m not paying attention in class too, going in one ear out and out the other. Maybe it just happened to get noticed. More importantly, isn’t your work soon?”</p>



<p>“Soon… Oh crap… It’s gonna be close!”</p>



<p>“Let’s hurry then. Mine is also soon.”</p>



<p>“Yeah!”</p>



<p>Both of them left the entrance at a fast pace. They exited the school gate, and when they came to a fork, “Ah!” Shino suddenly spoke up and came to a stop.</p>



<p>“What’s up?”</p>



<p>“There’s something I forgot to mention. So while waiting for you, Takasago-chan talked to me for a bit and consulted me for some stuff… We’ll talk in detail later, but I’d like to have your help too, so…”</p>



<p>“Help? If there’s anything I can do, I don’t really mind, though…”</p>



<p>“Thanks! Don’t forget about it! Then, later!”</p>



<p>Takasago, someone who was like a small animal, and Shino, a gyaru—looking from the side, they were both a kind that would have nothing to do with each other.</p>



<p>However, since the matter of confectionery making at the school festival, perhaps having gotten to know each other to some extent, it seemed they were now close enough that one would consult the other even.</p>



<p>As long as they didn’t make a pass at Sandai, Shino was kind to the same sex, so Takasago probably found it easy to ask for some advice, but…</p>



<p><em>Even so, consulting Shino, huh. When it comes to Takasago taking actions… probably related to the Prez, isn’t it?</em></p>



<p>Sandai knew that Takasago liked the Prez. So he thought it was probably Prez related, and indeed it was.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>After his part-time job, Sandai went to pick Shino up, and like usual, sat down at the seat he was guided to and sipped the served boyfriend privilege black tea.</p>



<p>He let out a breath, and then finally, he realized Takasago sitting in front of him sharing the same table. Shino had said that Takasago had come to consult her, but it seemed she had called Takasago here.</p>



<p>“H-Hello.” Seemingly waiting for the right timing to greet him, Takasago bowed her head repeatedly at the same time as Sandai noticed her. After that she timidly looked around. “It’s a v-very stylish cafe… where Yuizaki-san is working… You don’t seem bothered at all, Fujiwara-kun, but are you used to it?”</p>



<p>“Eh? Ah… well… somewhat. I felt completely out of place at first, but as I‘ve been coming here to pick Shino up everyday, I got used to it.”</p>



<p>“Hwah… you pick her up everyday… is that voluntary? Or did Yuizaki-san ask you to?”</p>



<p>“Picking her up is something I do voluntarily, I’d say,” Sandai openly told her the particular, as it wasn’t anything to hide.</p>



<p>Afterwards, Takasago hung her head down, mumbling, “Getting treasured like that… so envious.” Takasago’s murmur was so small that one could think that it was the chirping of a bird.</p>



<p>“I couldn’t really hear it, but… did you say something?”</p>



<p>“Heh? Ah, no, not really…” Takasago flusteredly waved both of her hands, and hung her head once more.</p>



<p>And then silence fell without any murmuring.</p>



<p>For better or worse, Takasago was a <em>girl</em> in another sense different from Shino. She seemed like she would immediately get hurt if not treated carefully, so treading carefully when dealing with her would be necessary.</p>



<p>“By the way Takasago, seems like you consulted Shino for some stuff, huh?”</p>



<p>“Y-Yes. I consulted Yuizaki-san a bit, and then she wanted to have your help, too, and then, umm, she said to just quickly get through the talk with the three of us, umm, it seems Yuizaki-san will be done with her part-time job around this time, and then so she said you will come pick her up at her workplace, so it will be just right, she said…”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;How much have you heard from Yuizaki-san, Fujiwara-kun?”</p>



<p>“Not a thing, I was only told we’ll talk in detail later.”</p>



<p>“Still not anything…?”</p>



<p>“That’s right. But I can kinda guess,” Sandai said and continued. “About Prez, isn’t it?” Only for Takasago to tightly shut her lips and hang her head down with a bright red face.</p>



<p>How to put this, Takasago did nothing but hung her head down.</p>



<p>“H-How… If you haven’t heard the details, you’re not supposed to know…!”</p>



<p>“I kinda just had the hunch.”</p>



<p>“C-Could it be that it was always showing in my attitude or something?”</p>



<p>“It sure was. It was kinda obvious back then during the school festival.”</p>



<p>“Eeeh… No way…”</p>



<p>“Well at any rate, I’ll hear the details once Shino’s here. It was Shino you came to consult. It’s also just wrong if I start listening while leaving Shino out.”</p>



<p>Sandai rested his chin on one hand, and then Shino showed up. Apparently sensing the subtle mood between Sandai and Takasago, Shino puzzledly looked at the two’s faces alternatingly.</p>



<p>“I’m done with work~&#8230; wait, what&#8217;s with this mood?”</p>



<p>“Before hearing what it’s about, I somehow figured it was about the Prez and when I asked, I was right. And then after that Takasago got like this.”</p>



<p>“Could it be that you knew Takasago-chan likes the Prez?”</p>



<p>“I noticed during the school festival. It was just that obvious.”</p>



<p>“I didn’t have a single idea until I got consulted, though…”</p>



<p>“You dense.”</p>



<p>“To think that the day I got told that by you would come.”</p>



<p>“Because I’m basically on the side that gets told that. So, I still haven’t heard what the consulting was for, but in the end, how did it end up with my help being necessary?”</p>



<p>Shino looked at Takasago at Sandai’s question.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Sorry. Probably I should’ve tried to handle it myself actually, but umm, I just don’t know much about guys.”</p>



<p>“Eh, y-you don’t know much about guys?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I mean, my first boyfriend is Sandai.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;That is surprising.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“I thought you were experienced, so…”</p>



<p>“That’s not true. Well anyway, that’s how it is, so that’s why I told you I’d like to also have Sandai’s help, a guy. Also, I guess I just don’t really get along with Prez. For reasons.”</p>



<p>Shino had a little beef with the Prez.</p>



<p>When the Prez had tried to approach Sandai with an exaggerated movement, she had had the Prez eat her front kick. And she had done stuff like glaring at the Prez even afterwards.</p>



<p>So asking for Sandai’s help this time, after taking such a past into account… At least Sandai wouldn’t get closer to Prez, but…</p>



<p>At times Sandai would feel that Shino indeed going too far for getting jealous even over a slight interaction of him with the same sex, but he also knew that she wasn’t the type who would easily accept it when having that pointed out.</p>



<p>If he were to, it would instead add fuel to the fire, and she would turn even more hostility to the other party—to Prez in this case.</p>



<p>Nakaoka had said no one would be fit to be Shino’s boyfriend but Sandai, but that was exactly so.</p>



<p>If it weren’t Sandai, he probably would be on a hospital bed with a hole on his stomach about this time.</p>



<p>There were as many guys as there were stars in the sky who would love to be in a relationship with Shino, but even in the off chance one could get to date her, there was a limited number of people who got the capacity to face this kind of heavy love.</p>



<p>“Yuizaki-san, you said you don&#8217;t get along with Prez, but does your personality not match with his? Shihouin-kun is… I can say Shihouin-kun is a good person, though.”</p>



<p>“Eh? Ah… well umm, I think Prez is someone with a good personality, but, it’s just that, he did tick me off for some reasons.”</p>



<p>“Did Shihouin-kun do something to you, Yuizaki-san? Umm, in that case I will apologize in his place!”</p>



<p>“You really don’t have to apologize, Takasago-chan~. It was just me having a disagreement. With the Prez.”</p>



<p>Sandai did sense such a strong implicit, <em>I don’t feel like straightening out the disagreement, though</em>, in it, but seemingly to have taken the words literally, Takasago patted down her chest.</p>



<p>“Then I’m glad.”</p>



<p>“Mm-hmm. So, if I remember correctly, the consulting was about wanting me to look into what the Prez likes because you want to give him a birthday present, right?”</p>



<p>“Yes! Shihouin-kun’s birthday is the 15th of December, and I want to give it to him on that day! It seems he’s gotten his long-wished school year first place in the finals as well, and he looked really happy about it, so as a congratulation for that, too!”</p>



<p>“Probably best if we could just go ask directly, but even if we go to ask, Prez is probably gonna run away. Having said that, I don&#8217;t really want Sandai to get close either. But, asking directly is not the only way to get information about someone!”</p>



<p>Shino said something weird. Sandai spontaneously asked back.</p>



<p>“Asking directly is not the only way to get information…?”</p>



<p>“Let’s do detective work.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Detective work? Does it mean tailing him?”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>“You serious?”</p>



<p>“Serious.”</p>



<p>“You sure are a bundle of energy. Rather, is my help needed for that?”</p>



<p>“I mean, there might be something that wouldn’t get noticed if it’s just me, and I don’t know much about guys either. Besides, lots of detectives work in a team of two, right?”</p>



<p>To sum it up, the real truth seemed to be to also drag in Sandai somehow.</p>



<p>Although it was really random, Sandai also knew that Shino just wasn’t the type to think deeply.</p>



<p>Besides, Sandai also had the concern of Shino rushing in recklessly and making a blunder by letting her do it alone. So Sandai replied, “All right.”</p>



<p>To be able to easily go along with Shino like this was precisely because it was Sandai. Takasago wasn’t hiding her puzzlement, but that reaction was normal.</p>



<p>“Eh? Eh? Tailing him…?”</p>



<p>“Shino’s the type who does what she’s decided to do. I suppose she would also reconsider if there’s a reason that would force her to give up, but she’ll carry it out for sure as long as there’s no problem showing up.”</p>



<p>“As expected from you, Sandai. You do understand me!”</p>



<p>“Because it’s my responsibility to understand you. So, how exactly are we even supposed to tail him?”</p>



<p>“Right… Actually before deciding what to do exactly, I personally don’t like how ‘tailing’ sounds because it’s like we’re doing something bad, so let’s just change it to ‘doing detective work’!”</p>



<p>By phrasing it differently, it wouldn&#8217;t change the fact that they would take an action that might infringe the Prez’ privacy, nor could it erase the fact that it would be considered as <em>something bad</em> by the general public, but…</p>



<p>Well, if Shino said she would like it so, Sandai would simply comply.</p>



<p>“All right. Then how will we do this detective work exactly?”</p>



<p>“Hmm right so…”</p>



<p>“F-For me tailing is a bit…”</p>



<p>While leaving behind Takasago, the person wanting to consult, Sandai and Shino decided to carry it out on the day when they both would have a day-off from their part-time jobs and continued with the talk.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>The day to carry out the tailing came.</p>



<p>Although both Sandai and Shino would usually get ready to head to their part-time jobs once it was after school, today was a day-off. Without any hurry they were getting ready to leave, and carefully making sure every single move of Prez.</p>



<p>Speaking of which, the result of the talk: it would be just Sandai and Shino doing the tailing. Takasago had been feeling hesitant no matter what, so she had refused to join.</p>



<p>Apparently she was fine with just receiving the report of the investigation.</p>





<p><em>“Say, you got no work today, Shino?”</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s a day-off, but I have something to do today.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Must be on a date with your bf, isn’t it? Fujiwara already totally your priority after all.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Yeah.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Haaah~&#8230; bfbfbfbfbfbfbfbfbf, I want a bf too~.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Good luck.”</em></p>



<p><em>“See ya.”</em></p>






<p>Shino’s friends languidly walked out of and left the classroom. As time passed, the number of other classmates were decreasing as well, and when they noticed, most of them were gone.</p>



<p>However, the Prez was still in the classroom.</p>



<p>Apparently absorbed in reading something, he was staring at the book with a serious face while seated in his own seat.</p>



<p>“The Prez, I wonder what he’s reading. A pocket book?”</p>



<p>“Probably some kind of academic book, I guess.”</p>



<p>“A difficult book?”</p>



<p>“It’s a difficult book, I’d say.”</p>



<p>“If you read something like that… will your test score go up?”</p>



<p>“Your results in like modern Japanese can probably go up—hmm?”</p>



<p>Prez checked the time, closed the book, put it in his bag, and headed out of the school. Sandai and Shino followed after him.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Maybe he’s going home?”</p>



<p>“He checked the time, so rather than going home, it sure feels like he got somewhere to go.”</p>



<p>“I wonder where he’s going.”</p>



<p>The Prez pushed up the bridge of his glasses with his middle finger once, suddenly stopped in his tracks and looked back.</p>







<p><em>“Is it my imagination? I feel like someone’s watching, though…”</em></p>







<p>Sandai and Shino hurriedly went into cover to hide.</p>



<p>“That’s close!”</p>



<p>“C’mon, don’t suddenly look back, Prez.”</p>



<p>Prez tilted his head like, “?” and started walking once again. And then, he went into a multi-floor building near the station.</p>



<p>There was a list of names of preparatory schools on the building’s nameplate. There were all kinds of preparatory schools, ranging from a well-known to an unheard-of one.</p>



<p>“Sure is a building with all kinds of prep schools.”</p>



<p>“Uwaah… I absolutely don’t wanna go to a prep school. I mean, it costs like lot of money too, right?”</p>



<p>From Shino’s perspective, who wasn’t good at studying, apparently the act of devoting oneself to studying so much that one would even voluntarily pay for it was hard to understand.</p>



<p>The feeling was understandable.</p>



<p>Sandai as well, he would rather spend money on light novels or animes and wouldn’t consider studying so hard he would pay for it, so he had been doing the so-called self-study style at home until now.</p>



<p>However, he also understood the good points of preparatory schools.</p>



<p>“Because if you have eyes set on college entrance exams, prep school will help. You’ll get taught the tendency of your desired college and the strategy for it. It’ll take time if you try to do it alone. It can be a shortcut.”</p>



<p>“Studying for entrance exams… Is it something you do now? Even though we’re still in second year.”</p>



<p>“It also depends on the college you want to go to, but when it comes to aiming for somewhere famous, probably there are also people who have been preparing for it ever since middle school.”</p>



<p>“I totally can never do it…”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s also hard to maintain your motivation. Unless it’s someone with some kind of motive or reasons, you won’t last.”</p>



<p>“Do you have any kind of goal or something, Sandai? You’re pretty good at studying, right? I mean, you’re good enough you can help me avoid failing.”</p>



<p>Sandai was certainly good at studying.</p>



<p>But not because he liked studying, nor because there was some kind of strong motive that he was devoting himself to it. It was simply killing time.</p>



<p>“It’s because I’m a loner and time is all I got. I just got nothing else to do, so I&#8217;ve always been studying.”</p>



<p>“I see now. But now that you mentioned it, you sure are pretty monotonous and don’t seem like there’s something you wanna do.”</p>



<p>“Guess so. That aside, we can’t just keep on standing in front of the building, so let’s go to the fast food over there. We can also see this building’s entrance if we take the window seat.”</p>



<p>“Roger.”</p>



<p>Sandai and Shino entered the fast food restaurant, and took a vacant window seat. From here they were monitoring the building’s entrance, and waited for Prez to come out.</p>



<p>However, Prez never came out even after several hours of waiting.</p>



<p>Next thing they knew, it was already 8 pm.</p>



<p>Perhaps the Prez had a lot of courses, or maybe he was doing a considerably serious course. Although they had never asked the person himself, he did seem to have a goal, and from his usual speech and conduct they could tell that he also got a high motivation to study.</p>



<p>Why is someone with a good head like you in our school—Sandai had once been told so by Nakaoka, but it seemed that applied to Prez as well.</p>



<p>It meant that with academic ability being close to Sandai’s, he could at least get 70 or 80 even if he were to take the national university entrance exam now.</p>



<p>“Prez doesn’t come out at all… Do you study this long in a prep school? This is basically like a normal school.”</p>



<p>Shino’s patience seemed to be considerably wearing thin due to the tailing getting stretched out, and it was beginning to show on her face.</p>



<p>It seemed it would be good to bring up a topic that could improve her mood a little.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Speaking of which, do you remember how I said I would give you a reward for working hard studying? Let’s choose it together now. It’s an effective use of time.”</p>



<p>“I do remember~! You’re right, let’s think about it now!”</p>



<p>As they were chatting, “How’s this?” “How about this this one?” while searching on their phones, Shino’s mood was getting better.</p>



<p>Shino was so cute with such a simple side of hers.</p>



<p>That was why Sandai now wanted to spoil her a bit, and when Shino just now murmured, “I wanna go to a hot spring,” he ended up wanting to fulfill that wish.</p>



<p>Next thing he knew, he was making a phone call to a hot spring inn that seemed to have availability on the spur of the moment.</p>







<p><em>“Thank you for calling. This is OO Inn.”</em></p>



<p>“I’m calling to make a reservation…”</p>



<p><em>“Certainly. Then I would like to ask for the desired date, if I may.”</em></p>



<p>“Is there any availability after the 24th of December? It will be for two people, one female and one male. For one night.”</p>



<p><em>“Outside of the 31st, we do have rooms available for reservation, however…”</em></p>



<p>“I see. Umm, by the way, do the price… differs depending on the day?”</p>



<p><em>“From the 29th of December to the 5th of January of the following year, a special surcharge will be applied. For dates outside of these, a surcharge will be applied for Sundays and national holidays, and then the regular rate will be applied for weekdays.”</em></p>



<p>“Err… I’m not sure what date will be good… How about the 28th…?”</p>



<p><em>“The 28th is a weekday, so the regular rate will be applied. Would you like your reservation to be for this date?”</em></p>



<p>“Ah, I see. Then for the 28th please. One room for two people, one female and one male, and the least expensive one please.”</p>



<p><em>“Certainly. Then may I ask for your name?”</em></p>



<p>“It’s Fujiwara. It’s Fujiwara Sandai.”</p>



<p><em>“Thank you very much. Then I would like to confirm the information, if I may. It will be one room for two people, one female and one male, and since the least expensive room has been requested, we will prepare a normal sized, traditional room. Only breakfast will be served. The reservation is for one night on the 28th, and the name of the reserver is Fujiwara Sandai-sama. Is there any mistake?”</em></p>



<p>“N-No. It’s all correct.”</p>



<p><em>“Thank you very much. We OO Inn has received your reservation. We look forward to seeing you on the day of your visit.”</em></p>







<p>Sandai regained his calmness only after ending the call and seeing Shino looking slightly apologetic.</p>



<p>“Is it really okay…?”</p>



<p>If we were to express Sandai’s honest feeling currently, it would be: <em>I went for an overnight trip on the spur of the moment. What should I do?</em></p>



<p>However, it was also hard to make another call to cancel it immediately after making a reservation. Besides, there was just a little bit of putting on airs as well.</p>



<p>“It’s fine.”</p>



<p><em>No backtracking</em>, Sandai encouraged himself so. And then, riding on this momentum, Sandai also decided to brace himself to face the problem that had been put on hold.</p>



<p>“As expected, I think it’s very insincere to go for an overnight trip while I still haven’t greeted your parents. That’s why I’ll go and greet your parents before we head to the hot spring.”</p>



<p>“Err… I don’t mind, but… somehow it’s like you’re suddenly ready on the spur of the moment. Are you like being rash or anything, Sandai?”</p>



<p>“I’m not. It’s just, I want what can be done done while there’s still the momentum.”</p>



<p>“O-Okay, I got it.”</p>



<p>The making of the decision owed everything to Sandai’s own conflicted feelings, but it seemed to look so sudden to Shino, making her bewildered.</p>



<p>However, Shino looked somewhat happy as well.</p>



<p>With such an event on one hand, the clock was almost about to turn to 9 pm. Shortly after, Prez finally came out from the preparatory school building.</p>



<p>“There’s the Prez coming out.”</p>



<p>“You’re right. He finally came out.”</p>



<p>Sandai and Shino let out one big sigh, quickly paid the bill, got out of the restaurant, and once again began following Prez.</p>



<p>Despite not looking to the front as he was concentrating on flash cards, Prez was skillfully walking without bumping into anyone passing by.</p>



<p>Experience would be essential to do something like this. So to sum it up, Prez was regularly studying even when he was walking.</p>



<p>As Sandai couldn’t help but be impressed from seeing such an untiring endeavor from close by, Prez entered the biggest bookstore in the commercial district.</p>



<p>“He entered a bookstore.”</p>



<p>“I guess we should enter, too.”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>They entered the bookstore and continued tailing Prez. Prez was looking for a university entrance exam workbook in the exam preparation section.</p>



<p>Completely serious and loyal to his studies.</p>



<p>“Hey hey, Sandai. What’s that red book?”</p>



<p>“That’s gotta be a collection of past questions. The college entrance exam stuff.”</p>



<p>“Does it mean he’s still thinking about studying even after he’s done with prep school?”</p>



<p>“I guess so.”</p>



<p>“As for me, rather than studying for exams, I’d rather do this kind of studying!”</p>



<p>Perhaps having spotted it somewhere, Shino held a book titled <em>20 Ways to Kiss to Deepen Your Love</em> and thrusted it out in front of Sandai.</p>



<p>“&#8230;It sure is a one-of-a-kind book.”</p>



<p>“But, something like this makes you wanna take a look at it, right? 20 kinds of kissing that’ll deepen your love!”</p>



<p>It certainly was a book more intriguing than a reference book, so Sandai nodded. Shino went to pay the bill as she puffed out, and then came back.</p>



<p>And at that moment.</p>



<p>Prez suddenly turned to look over here. Sandai and Shino hurriedly hid themselves.</p>







<p><em>“I think I heard a familiar voice</em>…<em>”</em></p>







<p>Could it be that they had been noticed?</p>



<p>Not sure.</p>



<p>Sandai and Shino held their breath, and decided to wait for Prez to think that it was his imagination.</p>



<p>“Umm.”</p>



<p>Prez was still looking in their direction. They hoped Prez would quickly look back at the bookshelves, but…</p>



<p>“Umm, Yuizaki-san, Fujiwara-kun.”</p>



<p>“What now? We’re currently on the verge of getting found out by Prez.”</p>



<p>“Yeah yeah. Be quiet for a—wait, Takasago-chan!?”</p>



<p>Shino was greatly surprised. Sandai was surprised as well and looked back.</p>



<p>Takasago was there for some reason.</p>



<p>She wasn&#8217;t supposed to come for the tailing, though…</p>



<p>“Why are you here, Takasago?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I thought you said you’d wait for the report.”</p>



<p>Asked in rapid succession by Sandai and Shino, Takasago mumblingly and nervously spoke. “Umm, in the end, I felt bad just leaving it to you two, and I actually have been following you from the start, so…”</p>



<p>What an unexpected development. Sandai and Shino had been tailing Prez, and then it seemed that she had been tailing them tailing him.</p>



<p>Still, even though no one could’ve expected this, Sandai and Shino getting surprised by Takasago’s appearance was a bad move.</p>



<p>Because of them making loud voices, they ended up getting noticed by Prez. Next thing they knew, Prez had already arrived before them.</p>



<p>“Today I felt like there’s some weird gazes on me… so it’s you guys.”</p>



<p>Prez pushed up the bridge of his glasses with his middle finger.</p>



<p>Because of the light inside the store reflecting off the glass of his glasses, it was hard to tell what kind of expression Prez was making, but he must’ve understood that he had been tailed.</p>



<p>Sandai and Shino looked at each other’s faces.</p>



<p>Both of them had a sour expression.</p>



<p>As Sandai was worrying whether it would be better to honestly apologize, Takasago dashed out in front of Prez.</p>



<p>“U-Umm, Shihouin-kun.”</p>



<p>“Takasago? Were you also following me? Just for what purpose?”</p>



<p>“N-No, that’s not.”</p>



<p>“Could it be that you received some bad influences from Fujiwara-kun and Yuizaki-kun? You’re supposed to be a proper student.”</p>



<p>As to be expected, Prez seemed to be angry as well.</p>



<p>That was also clear to see from him using sharp words, calling Sandai and Shino <em>bad influences</em>.</p>



<p>“Yuizaki-san and Fujiwara-kun didn’t do anything wrong. It’s because I requested them to look into you, so…”</p>



<p>“You did? Do you have any reason? If you did any of this for no serious reason, as expected, you will hurt my… feelings…”</p>



<p>Prez suddenly began to lose his words.</p>



<p>It was because the tears running down Takasago’s cheeks were dropping on the floor.</p>



<p>“Umm, I… umm… I want to know about you…”</p>



<p>“You want to know…?”</p>



<p>“Because I like you.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“I like you, so I want to know about you. I also know your birthday is close, so I want to know what you like, and so…”</p>



<p>Takasago’s tears were increasing and eventually became like a waterfall.</p>



<p>Takasago crouched down and cried on and on, perhaps incessantly overwhelmed by the feelings of love, and regret of having done something to get herself hated.</p>



<p>And then, “I’m sorry,” she repeated nothing but those words. In the meantime, a crowd had formed in the surroundings.</p>







<p><em>“What? Why’s there a girl crying?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Looks like that four-eyes is the cause, bro.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Don’t go around making a girl cry, dude.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Is it a couple’s quarrel?”</em></p>







<p>Prez was flustered, perhaps not knowing what he should do, but it seemed he understood that only he could do something about this situation.</p>



<p>Prez crouched down, and when he and Takasago were eye level, he placed his hand on her shoulder.</p>



<p>“Umm… When you said <em>like</em>, did it mean <em>as the opposite sex</em>?”</p>



<p>“Hyesh.”</p>



<p>No matter how many times Takasago tried to wipe her tears with her hands, it never stopped. However, the moment Prez wiped it with his finger, her tears stopped.</p>



<p>“I hope this won’t hurt your feelings, but to be frank, I don’t understand a girl’s heart at all. I have little connection to such matters, and then I’m unfamiliar with it above anything else. That’s why I don’t know what I should do.”</p>



<p>“Doez ith mean… doez ith mean you hate me?”</p>



<p>“I never said that. It just means I don’t understand. That’s why if you don’t mind, how about we start as friends?”</p>



<p>Prez still looked troubled, but at the same time, his voice carried some kind of gentleness in it.</p>



<p>Takasago closed her lips tightly, and then like a metronome, nodded again and again.</p>



<p>This was probably a development completely beyond expectation for Takasago, but concerning the result, it seemed to have turned in the good direction.</p>







<p><em>“Not bad, four-eyes.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Way to go, four-eyes. That’s exactly what being a man is.”</em></p>

<p><em>“Now that’s what I call youth!”</em></p>







<p>Sandai and Shino quietly slipped away from the crowd and sneaked out of the bookstore.</p>



<p>“I wasn’t sure how it would turn out for a time, but it seems it worked out, huh.”</p>



<p>“When things are like that, it’s better to quietly leave them alone, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“And they probably can handle the rest themselves. Guess it’s time to go back. It’s also time for your train, right?”</p>



<p>“Ah, you’re right.”</p>



<p>Regardless of the particulars, Takasago had conveyed her feelings, and the Prez had accepted it in his own way. And they should be able work out the rest themselves.</p>



<p>To meddle in it from that point forward would be boorish.</p>




<p>Regarding Takasago and the Prez after that, Sandai later was told some details by Shino. Takasago apparently prepared the birthday present for Prez by directly asking the person in question by herself.</p>
