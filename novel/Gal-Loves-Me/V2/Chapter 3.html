<h3>Chapter 3:  16 December –b25 December Christmas Is Here, Huh? </h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>More than 1,000 students were gathered in the gymnasium, and none were paying attention to the student counseling teacher’s lengthy speech about the regulation for winter holiday.</p>



<p>The speech before a long holiday is generally always the same. And Sandai did sense the content seeming similar to the end-of-term ceremony before the summer holiday and spring break.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, the sight of enrolled students all being gathered at the end-of-term ceremony was quite incredible. He had never bothered to pay attention to it before, but it was truly a school with a lot of students.</p>






<p><em>“Be aware that you are a student of our school, do not cause any trouble to the public, and behave uprightly and appropriately as each of you bears the name of our school on your back… err… in other words…”</em></p>







<p>When the student counseling teacher was done with the speech, next began the awarding of students who had made outside contributions such as having won an award outside of the school.</p>



<p>The principal stepped up next, and began to make a speech similar to that of the student counseling teacher’s.</p>



<p>It wasn’t like anything interesting was happening either, and as time passed, some began to whisper to each other, not content with just letting the speech go in one ear and out the other.</p>



<p>However, it wasn’t only the students who were beginning to get into such a slack mood, as it was the same for the teachers as well.</p>



<p>There were also many teachers with an expression as if wanting to say this was all a bore. And it was especially apparent when it came to Nakaoka, as she was completely asleep.</p>







<p><em>“Nakaoka-sensei, Nakaoka-sensei, please wake up.”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;Fuheh?”</em></p>



<p><em>“You were sleeping just now, right?”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;Oops.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I understand the urge to sleep, but you have to stay awake.”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;Zzzz.”</em></p>



<p><em>“And she went right back to sleep.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Well, Nakaoka-sensei is someone who does things her own way after all.”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;I apologize as I seem to jump in on the conversation, but speaking of Nakaoka-sensei, there is one thing that has been bothering me. Regarding the school trip in the third semester, I do have a feeling that only Nakaoka-sensei’s class hasn&#8217;t reached the decision for the destination, but…”</em></p>



<p><em>“Eh? Are you sure it’s not your imagination? Nakaoka-sensei certainly does things her own way, but for that sort of stuff, she is surprisingly reliable, so…”</em></p>



<p><em>“Is that so? Well, if the school nurse Sasakura-sensei, someone Nakaoka-sensei is on good terms with, says so, then that could possibly be the case. Nevertheless, if the school nurse is this pretty, there must be many students who make an effort to go to the infirmary every day, aren’t there?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Oh, please. That’s simply not the case. Fufu.”</em></p>







<p>The sense of becoming lax was prevalent among both students and teachers, and the principal looked somewhat crestfallen, but leaving that aside, the end-of-term ceremony ended without a problem.</p>



<p>For school events like this one, which comes with the word <em>ceremony </em>attached at the end, if it was an adolescent drama or something, the student council probably would have hijacked the gymnasium and started a band performance, or young motorcycle-riding delinquents would have gathered outside as a result of a fight caused by delinquent students, but this is reality.</p>



<p>Of course it wouldn’t develop that way. The ceremony simply came to a close, students returned to their classrooms, and the last homeroom of the second semester conducted in every class also went by.</p>







<p><em>“We have to be aware that we are students of this school, and this guidebook mentions all of that in detail. This is something the school has prepared for us, so we must act upon it during the winter holiday. Is that clear, everyone?”</em></p>



<p><em>“As if we can follow something like that, man.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Just don’t do anything that’ll get you arrested, then all’s fine.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Of course you mustn’t do anything that would get you arrested! Other than such obvious matters, this guidebook also provides reminders about areas that we tend to forget. It also has listings regarding places where there is a possibility of you getting caught up in an incident. For example: do not go to dangerous places like downtown after dark and such.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Yeah, yeah…”</em></p>



<p><em>“And one last thing from me as the class president. Those in the supplementary class, make sure to come tomorrow. I’ve been asked by the mathematics and physics teachers to help out with the supplementary class, you see. Those of you who failed in the relevant subjects, you can feel grateful.”</em></p>



<p><em>“For real?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I wish I’d failed, too… I would be able to study together with Shihouin-kun if I did… uwh… we finally managed to become friends and yet, I’m so stupid!”</em></p>







<p>School would also end earlier than usual on the day of the end-of-term ceremony, and students were dismissed at noon. It was time to leave school already.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>Sandai and Shino also left, disappearing into the wave of students leaving school in unison.</p>



<p>They had their part-time jobs today as well, but the starting time was as usual. In other words, they got about several hours of free time, so they decided to enjoy a carefree, stroll date.</p>



<p>They passed the time randomly walking around town, or catching whatever prize that caught their eyes at a crane game in an arcade.</p>



<p>“Why’re you only aiming for sweets prizes like that? C’mon, like, get the kitty and doggy stuffed toy over there.”</p>



<p>“Getting a stuffed toy is fine and all, but where do you wanna put them? Stuffs like that surprisingly take up space.”</p>



<p>“We can just put it at your place, right? There’s a lot of spare space there.”</p>



<p>“My apartment is unexpectedly small. If you keep on leaving stuff there nonstop, the entire place will immediately get buried. That reminds me… I feel like lately your daily necessities at home have been gradually increasing, though.”</p>



<p>Sandai purposefully hadn’t touched on the subject until now, but Shino lately had started leaving her stuff at his home.</p>



<p>At first he had only thought something along the lines of, <em>did she just forget it by accident?</em> but since she had started to leave obvious daily necessities such as shampoo, hair treatment, conditioner, shower gel and so on, it had turned into, <em>this is definitely not something she forgot</em>.</p>



<p>“You noticed…?”</p>



<p>“I noticed.”</p>



<p>“So you noticed…”</p>



<p>Seeing Shino’s reaction, it seemed she had done it on purpose, but…</p>



<p>Although it was assortments brimming full with wanting to sleep over, Sandai had only ever allowed that on that one day when the typhoon had hit, and he basically had no intention of letting Shino stay the night.</p>



<p>What was in his head was about Shino’s parents.</p>



<p>He knew that Shino had the confidence to pull off a good excuse, and actually Shino had easily gotten away with it during that typhoon.</p>



<p>However, Sandai felt that such a way of doing things wasn’t all right.</p>



<p>He understood he was keeping up appearances, but precisely because he loved her that he wouldn’t want to not take it seriously. Precisely because he wouldn’t want to not take it seriously that he would go greet Shino’s parents before going on a trip together.</p>



<p>“I’ll let you know, but I’m not gonna let you stay the night at my place so often like that.”</p>



<p>“Eh? Why?”</p>



<p>“Because your parents will get worried. Even if you make up some lie, it probably would turn into a disaster if that got found out.”</p>



<p>“I think it’s gonna be fine, though.”</p>



<p>“I’m going to greet your parents before the trip, but I don’t want it to get found out before that, even if it&#8217;s unlikely. I want them to think that I’m a decent boyfriend. I want to get your parents approval, and have our relationship also supported by them.”</p>



<p>“Feeling like you’re thoroughly thinking about marriage too, no?”</p>



<p>Shino’s expression looked half teasing and half serious.</p>



<p>Shino knew the answer, but she would like him to put it in words to confirm it; this kind of asking a question was Shino’s own way to indirectly achieve that.</p>



<p>But as far as his feelings were concerned, it was already firm. So Sandai didn’t get perturbed from getting asked indirectly now.</p>



<p>“&#8230;If possible, I’d like to go as far as marrying you. You’re number one for me, and I want to be the number one for you, too. It’s because I think marriage is the contract that’ll give form to stuff like that.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>At Sandai’s brazen declaration without even a shred of feeling embarrassed, Shino smiled contentedly.</p>



<p>“You’re responsible for your words, okay?”</p>



<p>“You’re right.”</p>



<p>“Fufu, I’m really happy that you put it into words like that.”</p>



<p>“If I repeat saying something like this again and again, wouldn’t you get used to it, and it stops resonating with you sooner or later?”</p>



<p>“That’s not true, you know? It just makes me wanna hear it again and again, and if you stop, I guess it’s gonna make me worried instead~. I’d wonder if you’re really cherishing me even now, if you love me. So, I’d hate it if you don’t reassure me by doing it regularly.”</p>



<p>It is very important to put things into words.</p>



<p>However, the frequency and the timing of it also depends on each person. At times, it can also create cracks due to some changes in the environment or in the heart.</p>



<p>That was why Sandai tried to find out <em>how much does Shino want right now?</em> from her nonchalant words and actions.</p>



<p>From how Shino was replying just now, it didn’t seem to be that different from before, so he understood that she wanted the same lovey-doveyness as before.</p>



<p>“Speaking of which, you didn’t forget what day tomorrow is, did you? I mean, you sometimes leave out the important things.”</p>



<p>Tomorrow would be the 24th and Christmas Eve.</p>



<p>It would be the day where they would stay together all day, which Sandai had promised Shino, and he, too, had taken a day-off from his part-time job like her.</p>



<p>Komaki had frowned on him when he had requested for the day-off, but she had yielded after he had brought out the promise with Shino, his girlfriend.</p>



<p>It was a time period where it was easy to lose manpower regardless of the busyness, and so Komaki probably would like to secure personnel if possible, but even so, Sandai would like to prioritize Shino.</p>



<p>Speaking of which, Hajime had happened to be present when this had been taking place. Although Hajimed had said “Just who’s more important, me or your girlfriend?” with his cheeks inflated… this had probably been the usual joke, Sandai had regretfully ignored it.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Tomorrow is Christmas Eve. We promised to stay together, didn’t we?”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>The longer the relationship continues, the more the guy will tend to make light of promises. They would take advantage of the girl in such forms: <em>this should be good enough</em> or <em>I’m sure she’ll understand</em> and such.</p>



<p>However, Sandai had a nature slightly different from normal guys, so he didn’t really have such a tendency.</p>



<p>His loner-bad-at-socializing side brought about a strong influence, sending him in the direction of wanting to keep promises more the closer the relationship got.</p>



<p>He would like to maintain the relationship he had managed to painstakingly get, and naturally thought of not wanting to let down the other party.</p>



<p>This kind of aspect in Sandai was one of the charms lacking in those outgoing.</p>



<p>To put into words, outgoing people, who would easily build personal relationships, often have connections with a lot of people, but if looked from another perspective, it makes them tend to neglect each and every one of them.</p>



<p>A person has only so much available time and capacity; as long as those outgoing stay outgoing, no matter if it is consciously or unconsciously, they have no choice but to neglect someone. Of course, there are also the aspects of being cheerful and approachable on a fundamental level, so it absolutely doesn’t mean that they’re bad people, however…</p>



<p>Leaving a comparison between a loner and an outgoing person aside, it was now time for their part-time job in the meanwhile.</p>



<p>It went on as usual from there.</p>



<p>Done with work earlier, Sandai went to pick Shino up, spent alone time together in his apartment, and went on to walk Shino all the way to the station’s platform.</p>



<p>“Well then, see you tomorrow.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I’ll take the first train, so pick me up, please~.”</p>



<p>“Got it. I’ll wake up early and wait for you on the platform.”</p>



<p>“I’ll get mad if you oversleep and come late, okay?”</p>



<p>“Today I’ll go to sleep early.”</p>



<p>When Shino jumped into the railroad car, the door closed together with a <em>psssh </em>sound. And then immediately after, “Ah!” Shino seemed to have remembered something, and she hurriedly knock-knocked the window to get Sandai’s attention.</p>



<p>“~~~~!”</p>



<p><em>What’s Shino trying to tell me?</em></p>



<p>When Sandai titled his head, Shino closed her eyes and stuck out her lips.</p>



<p>It was an urging for a kiss.</p>



<p><em>Ah… that reminds me, we haven’t had a goodbye kiss.</em></p>



<p>Sandai hurriedly gave a kiss through the window.</p>



<p>The feeling of the cold windowpane cooled down his hastiness.</p>



<p>When Sandai opened his eyes after doing it for about two or three seconds, Shino was pointing at him and laughing.</p>



<p>“What? Huh? Why’re you laughing?”</p>



<p>Sandai had not the slightest idea of what was happening. Though, he immediately realized the reason for Shino’s laugh. Shino laughed after seeing Sandai pressing his lips against the windowpane.</p>



<p>It was so unbearably embarrassing, making Sandai’s face as hot as fire. However, as the train promptly began to move, separating him from Shino, he started to regain his calmness somewhat.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, that wasn’t the end of it, since the image Shino sent him a few minutes later made him embarrassed once again.</p>



<p>Shino had sent Sandai the portrait photo of him pressing his lips against the train’s windowpane.</p>



<p>Seeing the photo, he understood that that was certainly a face that could end up causing laughter, but… it was nothing to laugh at for the concerned party.</p>



<p>Furthermore, although unclear whether Sandai would ever know, Shino decided to save and cherish this image, and would later on kiss the image in times of loneliness or sadness. After all, it was her important boyfriend’s endearing photo with which she could cheer herself up.</p>



<p>That said, for Sandai who didn’t know that, it was simply an embarrassing photo, so he sent multiple short texts and forcibly pushed the photo up so he wouldn’t be able to see it.</p>







<p>&gt;What’re you fretting about? Lol</p>



<p>&gt;I just thought it’s a terrible face.</p>



<p>&gt;It’s your own face, right~.</p>



<p>&gt;I didn’t wanna take a straight look at my own grossness.</p>







<p>Sandai expressed his feelings concisely, and then Shino continuously sent a sticker expressing big laughter. Now that it got to this, Sandai would get laughed at regardless of what he would say, so—</p>



<p>&gt;Good night.</p>



<p>—he sent such a text and forcibly ended the conversation.</p>



<p>After all, it was possible it would crack her up more in some way the more he tried to gloss it over.</p>

<p>“I feel like she’s kept getting one over on me, I guess I’ll have the tables turned on her someday…”</p>



<p>Having decided to take Shino’s funny face photo given the opportunity, Sandai took a bath a little early and hit the bed without waiting to watch late-night anime like usual, since he mustn&#8217;t oversleep tomorrow.</p>



<p>Next morning.</p>



<p>Sandai woke up around the time the sun still hadn’t risen.</p>



<p>He did feel like he had woken up a little too early, but since it was much better than oversleeping, he went to change, got ready, and headed to the station at a brisk pace. On the way there, he remembered that he still hadn’t had breakfast and went into a convenience store to buy some sweet bread and ate it.</p>



<p>When he checked the time on his phone, there was about two hours to spare before the train Shino would get on would arrive, so for the time being, he killed time at a 24-hour karaoke just for one hour, and after that, he killed time by having a stroll at the business district.&nbsp;</p>



<p>There were still many stores not open, probably because it was early morning.</p>



<p>There were also shops replaced with another one without him noticing, as well as signboards he had never seen before every now and then.</p>



<p>He usually wouldn’t really take much notice of it, but the city was changing every day little by little and was completely different when compared to several months ago.</p>



<p>Though, somehow Sandai thought: that life was surely the same as this ever changing city. Some kind of change was happening every day, but that was happening little by little, so you wouldn’t notice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Change is not a bad thing.</p>



<p>Even Sandai himself, compared to the early days of the relationship with Shino, had changed to a degree.</p>



<p>As for whether he could make that a good change or turning that into a bad change, it was up to the person himself.</p>



<p>“Oops, I guess it’s time.”</p>



<p>It was now the time for Shino’s train to arrive, so he entered the station’s premises.</p>



<p>“Uwh, so cold…”</p>



<p>The train station’s platform in winter would often feel colder than the air temperature, but why? He somehow felt that the white breath he exhaled was thicker than usual.</p>



<p>Sandai bought a warm drink from the vending machine and drank it little by little. Since Shino’s train arrived immediately after, he drank it up in one go and put the empty can in the recycling bin.</p>



<p>The current time was earlier than the rush hour, so the railroad cars were pretty much empty. He also immediately spotted Shino.</p>



<p>“Morning!” Shino was full of energy. He could tell from that alone that she had been looking forward to this day. “It’s cold in the morning, so let’s hold hands.”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>The two held hands and began to walk unhurriedly.</p>



<p>It was the 24th of December. Christmas Eve. The once-a-year sacred day began, where at night lovers would whisper their love in unison.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>The city began to gradually show its liveliness when it was about past 9 am.</p>



<p>Christmas songs began being played, and decorative lighting began flickering despite the clear weather, perhaps to stand out in order to attract customers even if a little.</p>



<p>“You sure can call this uselessly raising your electricity bill, I guess.”</p>



<p>“Don’t they use, like, light bulbs that don’t use much electricity for this kinda thing? I feel like our cafe got something like that, too.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I see…”</p>



<p>“A place with a good atmosphere spotted! C’mon, let’s go there. Looks like they just opened up, too.”</p>



<p>Pulled along by Shino, they entered the shop that had standing signboard written with: Couples Only Discount.</p>



<p>“Welcome.”</p>



<p>“For two please~.”</p>



<p>“Would it be as a couple?”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>“Well then, please have a seat over there. Once you have decided on what to order, please call the staff with the bell.”</p>



<p>Taking a seat on the shown seat, they picked up the menu.</p>



<p>The menu was apparently special only for today; everything was written with <em>Couple Style</em>, and then the picture was also unique. All of the drinks came with a heart-shaped straw, and for light meals as well, such as the sandwich sliced into the word: LOVE.</p>



<p>“They sure are thorough… Does your part-time job do stuff like this, too?”</p>



<p>“I think we’re not doing something like this. I mean, like, the customers are basically all women.”</p>



<p>“Ah…”</p>



<p>There were certainly almost only female customers to be seen at the cafe Shino was working at.</p>



<p>There would be male customers showing up occasionally, but they would mostly be the employee’s boyfriend, who would come there for the same reason Sandai would be waiting for Shino&#8217;s part-time job to end.</p>



<p>“We do events that like could be enjoyed with only women, but we don’t do stuff like discounts for couples.”</p>



<p>“Women-only, space-like atmosphere is the selling point, so when couples come crowding it, the general idea would go to waste, something like that?”</p>



<p>“The Assistant Manager’s also saying something like that!”</p>



<p>“Assistant Manager… Sure feels like I’ve seen the person before. Someone who seems overly serious, is it?”</p>



<p>“She’s overly serious, true, but she’s kind, you know? …Looks like Mei-chan isn’t good with her, though.”</p>



<p>It seemed Chocolate Cornets aka Mei had a hard time dealing with the Assistant Manager, but certainly, he did feel like the person in question grumbling about this and that.</p>



<p>An overly serious person has the impression of being difficult to approach, but they often have a fixed standard. As for Sandai, he was on the side that thought that that was a likable factor, so he couldn’t really sympathize with having a hard time dealing with one.</p>



<p>However, each person does feel about another person differently.</p>



<p>It is also natural for both ways of thinking and how a person feels to be different, so it is a waste of time only thinking which is right or wrong.</p>



<p>If Sandai were to go and start talking about such a thing, it would lead to the matter of him and Shino dating as well: as the world they lived in was different, they should break up.</p>



<p>He would hate that.</p>



<p>“Speaking of Chocolate Cornets, about the matter the other day… her compatibility with me is really bad, so I sure don&#8217;t wanna be left alone with her at all anymore.”</p>



<p>“Chocolate Cornets… Mei-chan will get angry if she hears that, so don’t say it in front of her, okay? If Mei-chan gets her hairstyle made fun of…”</p>



<p>“If it did?”</p>



<p>“She’ll go sob sob.”</p>



<p>“So gonna cry, huh. Well, that hairstyle seems like it would take time to do, so I guess she wouldn’t want it to get made fun of.”</p>



<p>“Right, right.”</p>



<p>Shino didn’t really show jealousy when it came to Mei, but probably because Shino could affirm that improper misconduct absolutely wouldn&#8217;t happen.</p>



<p>Sandai didn’t dislike Mei to that extent, and Mei was probably also the same, but nevertheless, there was a clear wall up between the two.</p>



<p>Well, leaving that aside, they would have to order something as long as they had entered a shop, so they began chatting while looking at the menu.</p>



<p>“Hnnn… It’s not like I’m hungry either, so I guess I’ll just go for a drink.”</p>



<p>“I’m also not that hungry either here.”</p>



<p>“It’ll be just drinks then. Wanna order one and drink it together? Or do we each order what we want? In any case, it’ll come with a heart-shaped couple straw, though.”</p>



<p>“Right… We can each order one, and then share a sip or two, can we?”</p>



<p>“All right, let’s do that then. I’m gonna order the strawberry juice~.”</p>



<p>“I wanna drink something refreshing, so I guess I’ll go with the pineapple.”</p>



<p>They both had decided what to order, so they called for a server by pressing the bell. It wasn’t food, so what they had ordered quickly came.</p>



<p>What Shino had ordered was a syrupy strawberry milk, and what Sandai had ordered was a pineapple juice with slices of pineapple inside the glass.</p>



<p>And then the couple straw was in either glass.</p>



<p>“&#8230;The glass is surprisingly big. Bigger than I thought. Actually, I even got a fork on mine, though.”</p>



<p>“It’s so you can eat the pineapple inside, isn’t it? The fork’s got no use other than for that, right?”</p>



<p>“I guess so.”</p>



<p>“Well, I think you don’t have to force yourself to eat it, though. I think it’s like an option for people who wanna eat it, you know? That aside, let’s quickly use the straw and drink together.”</p>



<p>Since Shino seemed to want to quickly use the couple straw, as told, he took a couple of slurps of the strawberry milk Shino had ordered first together with her.</p>



<p><em>It’s got a strong sweetness, I feel like it’s a bit too heavy to drink in the morning</em>, Sandai was commenting on the strawberry milk, but a bit later he noticed that Shino was staring at him.</p>



<p>“What’s up?”</p>



<p>“The strawberry milk…”</p>



<p>“Something wrong with it?”</p>



<p>“It totally didn’t get to me at all, though? You’re slurping too hard!”</p>



<p>It seemed Sandai had slurped it a little too strong, making the juice not go to Shino.</p>



<p>You would need to have a knack for using a couple straw, so to say.</p>



<p>“Careful, okay?”</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>“Then one more time!”</p>



<p>This time being careful, Sandai consciously slurped it with just the right amount of power. And then Shino was happily slurping it, apparently strawberry milk properly going to her.</p>



<p>Continuing from there, they similarly shared a couple of slurps of Sandai’s pineapple juice as well. The pineapple’s sourness was a bit strong, enough that Shino pursed her lips, going, “Hnn~,”&nbsp; but combined with the concentrated taste, it was pretty good for Sandai.</p>



<p>As for the pineapple inside, he only ate half. Although he wasn’t that hungry to begin with either, the juice additionally bloated up his stomach.</p>



<p>“A bit complaining, but the other day Miki said she wanted a cat, and it’s just troubling.”</p>



<p>“A kitty?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. But I told Miki she wouldn’t be able to look after it. Even if I tell her to cherish it since it’s another life, she’s probably gonna say nice things and look after it only at the start anyway. It’s so clear it would be me or Mom who’d end up looking after it in the end.”</p>



<p>“Cats are cute. So that probably made her want one.”</p>



<p>“You just can’t keep one just because it’s cute. I mean, like, a cat is a living thing with a life. Besides, it’s still better if it’s adopting a shelter cat that might’ve had a rough life in the past and making it happy, but what do you think Miki said?”</p>



<p>“What did she say?”</p>



<p>“She said she wanted a Persian cat. Because they’re so fluffy, she said. No other reason.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Sure seems like it&#8217;s gonna cost six figures.”</p>



<p>“She’s toooooooootally not gonna look after it, that Miki. It’s so obvious she’s just wanna pet it or bury her face in its fluffy fur.”</p>



<p>As they continued leisurely having such a chat, the number of customers were gradually increasing, and the seats inside the shop started to be filled up. Both Sandai and Shino had also finished drinking up what they had ordered, so they paid the bill and left since taking the seat for too long seemed to cause only convenience.</p>



<p>After that, they went around having fun. However, they were getting tired before long, so they switched it up, turning it into a home date.</p>



<p>After welcoming Shino into his apartment, Sandai suddenly realized a certain something and began to rummage through the closet.</p>



<p>“&#8230;What’re you doing?”</p>



<p>“Well, I thought it’s winter and all, so this.”</p>



<p>What Sandai had taken out was a kotatsu. It wasn’t as if it was necessary either since there was an AC, but a kotatsu really was one to match the mood of winter.</p>



<p>It would have been perfect had he realized and set it up this morning or yesterday, but well, nothing could be done since he had remembered just now.</p>



<p>“A kotatsu! Let’s go get in. Cozy snugly~.”</p>



<p>When he turned on the kotatsu, Shino became like a turtle, with everything but her face inside.</p>



<p>Previously, Shino had scolded Miki, telling her not to treat Sandai’s home as if it was hers, but… with the unauthorized setting up of her daily necessities and so on, it did feel like Shino was losing her right to warn Miki for this and that.</p>



<p>Well, she was probably thinking that she was special since she was his girlfriend, and Sandai was also allowing Shino’s behavior.</p>



<p>If there was an exception, it would be his PC. It was packed with porn images and videos, and with some games as well actually, so only the PC he absolutely wouldn’t let her touch.</p>



<p>Moreover, Sandai’s favorite lately was gyaru stuff. Actresses and characters looking like Shino had come to make up 80% of his folder.</p>



<p>He had been very anxious as well at times… shuddering at the thought of what if these were to get found out by Shino by some chance. When it came to possessing lots of porn behind the scenes while usually looking calm and indifferent about it, he would get misunderstood as a closet pervert.</p>



<p>Sandai would like to be thought of as a respectable boyfriend, and he got a strong awareness that he should be that way.</p>



<p>“When you got into a kotatsu, it does feel like it’s really winter~.”</p>



<p>“You’re right.”</p>



<p>“Ah… yeah, that’s right, wait a bit.”</p>



<p>Shino crawled out to grab her bag, and then crawled back with it. And then she placed the smaller bag she had taken out of her bag on Sandai’s lap.</p>



<p>“What’s this?”</p>



<p>“A Christmas present~.”</p>



<p>Wondering what could be inside, Sandai immediately opened it. What was inside was a muffler overflowing with a surprisingly luxurious feel.</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s a cashmere one so it’s soft and fluffy to the touch.”</p>



<p>Although not knowing what cashmere was, he could tell from its feel that it was an item as expensive as it looked.</p>



<p>“Thanks. I’m happy to receive this.”</p>



<p>“It’s great you’re happy with it!”</p>



<p>“Well then, looks like it’s my present next. Hold on for a bit.”</p>



<p>Sandai gave the wrapped, previously-bought lingerie to Shino.</p>



<p>“I wonder what’s inside~.” Shino was smilingly opening the wrapping and then froze up. “&#8230;”</p>



<p>“I thought it’s surely going to look good on you.”</p>



<p>“T-This is for me…?”</p>



<p>“That’s right.”</p>



<p>“So this means umm, y-y-you want me to wear this?”</p>



<p>“I bought it after giving it a lot of thought. I’d be happy if you could wear it for me.”</p>



<p>Sandai did think about how she would take it with lingerie for the present. However, it was too late to do anything about it now.</p>



<p>Besides, no matter what kind of circumstances behind it had been, it was no one but himself who had ultimately decided to buy this.</p>



<p>After having come this far with no way to turn back, Sandai’s mind was calm and unashamed.</p>



<p>“Awawawa…”</p>



<p>As for Shino, she unfolded the lingerie by pinching it with her fingers and got bewildered. However, seeing Sandai’s refreshing smile, she gulped down.</p>



<p>“I-I see… so it’s like… ‘I’m now ready. The rest depends on you’&#8230;”</p>



<p>“?”</p>



<p>“I got it! And the size looks fine, too… So then… I’ll bring it when we head to the hot spring, okay? I’ll also get myself ready!”</p>



<p>Without really knowing the meaning behind getting herself ready, Sandai tilted his head.</p>



<p>But for the time being, she didn’t seem to get creeped out.</p>



<p>That was great.</p>



<p>However, it was also true that he still only had one weight lifted from his shoulders. Sandai smiled wryly as it was still too early to relax.</p>



<p>He still had one big worry left.</p>



<p>“Before heading to the hot spring, I’ve gotta go and greet your parents.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Right.”</p>



<p>“We’ve also got only a couple of days left. Should I head there sometime tomorrow?”</p>



<p>“It’s better if it’s not tomorrow, I think? I’ll be working all day long, so it’s gonna be at night if you want it tomorrow, you know? Besides, tomorrow is Christmas, and my dad’s saying about having a family dinner outside, so it might be absurd timing-wise.”</p>



<p>“That’s… a no, I guess.”</p>



<p>“Well, I think you can also tag along for the dinner and greet them there, though…?”</p>



<p>“It’s not so bad when it’s a dining out arranged with me greeting them in mind, but if I wedge my way into a plan where it’s supposed to be an enjoyable time for family only, I feel like my impression will be bad.”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind it, and my mom and Miki probably won’t mind it either, but… my dad’s certainly can be a bit. Then how about the greeting on the 26th the day after tomorrow? That day we start work in the afternoon, so we can quickly be done with it in the morning.”</p>



<p>“Can it be done quickly like that?”</p>



<p>“An hour two is what we need. Or could it be that you’re planning to go out somewhere together with my parents?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Suddenly closing distance with someone like that is impossible for me.”</p>



<p>“So it’s gonna be in the morning the day after tomorrow then. I’ll also give my parents some explanation by then… Do you remember where my house is?”</p>



<p>“I remember it.”</p>



<p>As they were talking about the greeting little by little, Christmas Eve went by in a flash. It came to an end just like that.</p>



<p>They were smooching until each other was satisfied, and after that Sandai walked Shino to the station.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>25th, the next day.</p>



<p>For the first time in a while, Sandai would be spending a day with hardly any involvement with Shino.</p>



<p>Sandai had gone to his part-time job today, but when he was done with that, he would have nothing to do.</p>



<p>While vaguely thinking what to do, he clocked out and went outside. And immediately after, Hajime came running after him.</p>



<p>“Wait~.”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“I was thinking maybe you’re free after this.”</p>



<p>“Do I look like I’m free?”</p>



<p>“Hmm well, you took a day off yesterday, right? And that’s so you could spend the time together with Yuizaki-san, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;.You could say that.”</p>



<p>“But you came to work today, and you don’t look like you&#8217;re in a hurry either, so like I was wondering maybe you don’t have any plans with Yuzaki-san at all.”</p>



<p>Hajime was unexpectedly smart; he splendidly guessed the situation from Sandai’s words and conducts. Not expecting to have it guessed at all, Sandai couldn’t help but be impressed.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Oh wow. You’re on the mark.”</p>



<p>“Yay!”</p>



<p>“You sure are unexpectedly smart, Saeki.”</p>



<p>“Fufu.”</p>



<p>“Shino’s also got work today, all day long, and she said she’d go out for dinner with her family at night.”</p>



<p>“Spending the important Eve with a boyfriend, and the Christmas day itself with family or friends; that’s also something fairly common.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Well, leaving the matter about Yuizaki-san aside for a moment, it’s a rare opportunity, so c’mon, let’s hang out with me a little if you’re free.”</p>



<p>Apparently Hajime was also free today and wanted to hang out with Sandai. Sandai was also thinking about how he should kill time, but…</p>



<p>Somehow feeling like he would be betraying Shino by hanging out with Hajime, Sandai was hesitant.</p>



<p>“I personally don’t mind, but it’s just, I feel like I’m betraying Shino, so how do I say this, I feel bad, you see… because Shino might get angry.”</p>



<p>“Yuizaki-san will get angry even if you just hang out with other people a little? Don’t tell me, she’s the possessive type?”</p>



<p>“It’s because her personality’s like that.”</p>



<p>“But we’re fellow guys, so it’s fine, isn’t it? If she complains about that, then Yuizaki-san’s a little bit too much. There’s no need to restrict you from that.”</p>



<p>Sandai didn’t feel like he was being restricted, but he also could understand that what Hajime said was correct as a common opinion.</p>



<p>Shino’s love was heavy, exactly so.</p>



<p>However, Sandai was dating her on top of knowing that.</p>



<p>“I’ll gratefully accept your point, but as for me, also accepting that part of Shino and supporting her until she mellows out and softens up little by little is what I think a boyfriend&#8217;s supposed to do.”</p>



<p>“If you’re acting like you’re only putting up with it like that, you’re gonna end up so exhausted, so what you should do today is hanging out and taking a breather with me!”</p>



<p>“H-Hey, listen to what I—”</p>



<p>“—Strike while the iron is hot!”</p>



<p>Before knowing what was happening, his arm was pulled by Hajime.</p>



<p>Sandai was wavering whether to refuse or not, but he also got the feeling inside him that wouldn’t want to destroy his good relationship with Hajime, thus Sandai decided to accompany him a little.</p>



<p><em>…I guess occasionally having a day like this is also fine</em>.</p>



<p>Sandai lightly scratched his cheek, and seeing that, Hajime happily smiled.</p>



<p>Fingers small and slender, skin visible fleetingly through gaps in the clothing fresh and youthful, and the smell of shampoo and hand cream faintly drifting…</p>



<p>As for Sandai, he was currently making a face that seemed like it would get him poked in the eyes by Shino if she were to witness it… Well, now putting aside such a trivial thing.</p>



<p>The place Sandai got taken along to was a botanical garden. It was a place he couldn’t really associate with the words hanging out.</p>



<p>“&#8230;A botanical garden, huh. I thought for sure you were gonna take me to an amusement park or something.”</p>



<p>“Amusement park? Why did you think so?”</p>



<p>“You seem you would like D*sney’s animation, and I thought you would wanna go to its Land or Sea.”</p>



<p>“I do like D*sney’s animation, and I don’t dislike its Land or Sea either, but I mean, it’s totally gonna be packed today, you know? I don’t wanna wait for like an hour to get on an attraction.”</p>



<p>Certainly, it seemed that it would be crowded with people going there to have fun with families and such.</p>



<p>“I see now. On Christmas, it’ll be crowded since there’s also a lot of people going out with families… is it? And Shino’s going out for dinner with her family, too.”</p>



<p>“That ‘&#8230;is it?’ is a kinda weird way of saying it, huh? I believe you’ve got a family even if you’re a self-proclaimed loner bad at socializing, but didn’t you, like, have fun together with yours on Christmas?”</p>



<p>“My parents are busy with work and have always been away from home. That’s why I’ve been having fun on Christmas alone. I played something like Jenga or Game of Life.”</p>



<p>“B-By yourself?”</p>



<p>“By myself.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I feel like I’ve asked something I shouldn’t. Sorry.”</p>



<p>“It’s gonna be a damage to my spirit if you try to be considerate like that.”</p>



<p>His childhood was a bygone past. That was why he concluded that there was no meaning in thinking anything about that time.</p>



<p>That said, when remembering his child self with a dripping snot on the verge of tears playing, there would be a lot of damage.</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry.”</p>



<p>“It’s already in the past now. It doesn’t bother me in any way.”</p>



<p>“Somehow you look like you&#8217;re pretending to be tough, though…”</p>



<p>“That’s not true. We’re now done with this topic.”</p>



<p>Sandai was really not thinking of anything about it. Though, it apparently looked differently to Hajime’s eyes, and he looked somewhat apologetic.</p>



<p>However, with Sandai killing off the topic, Hajime just went with peering at Sandai with a glance for a moment and stopped bringing up the topic, perhaps having judged going further would only cause troubles.</p>



<p>When they entered the botanical garden, there were a large number of flowers of various colors. It seemed the control of temperature and humidity was thorough, as there were also sections where flowers that would only bloom in summer showing off their beautiful petals.</p>



<p>“You know, flowers are just cleansing to the heart, aren’t they…”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“That’s right. I mean, they’re pretty, they smell nice, and it feels like there’s lots of oxygen to boot!”</p>



<p>“I think the oxygen part’s just your imagination, you know?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“Plants do photosynthesis, but they require carbon dioxide for photosynthesis in the first place, and it’ll also be bad for plants when there’s excess oxygen. In a botanical garden, it’s possible that they’re filling in carbon dioxide in the middle of the day like now instead for photosynthesis.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“I’ll go ahead and say it, but looking at the bigger picture, the aggregate amount of oxygen on Earth is not something that’ll change easily. You know that earth is rotating, right?”</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah.”</p>



<p>“The Earth is rotating from the west to east. What comes out from that are westerlies and easterlies. These two winds will always blow as long as the Earth’s gyration doesn’t stop. This ‘will always blow’ is the point.”</p>



<p>“O-Ooh…”</p>



<p>“Mainly through these two atmospheric circulation, both the oxygen produced from photosynthesis at day in one area and the carbon dioxide produced from plants breathing at night in one area…”</p>



<p>“Stop talking like we’re having a class at school~!”</p>



<p>Hajime repeatedly hit Sandai’s shoulders.</p>



<p>“W-Well, it’s like stuff taught in science class in middle school. It’s not like it’s a topic that difficult either.”</p>



<p>“I’m saying this is not the time and place to talk about stuff like that. Are you doing it on purpose? You can talk about a laxer topic, you know? Fujiwara-kun.”</p>



<p>A laxer topic, it was difficult for Sandai, though…</p>



<p>When he was with Shino, he could also have that kind of talk, but Hajime was different from Shino.</p>



<p>Even if Sandai were to also use the way he would treat Shino, who was his girlfriend, it would definitely be weird. You could say it was a difficulty too high to ask of a loner who had never made a friend of the same sex.</p>



<p>However, it was also true that the only thing he could use as reference was his interactions with Shino, and there was also the saying that the proof was in the pudding.</p>



<p>Only once, Sandai decided to try to think of and act towards Hajime as if he was Shino.</p>



<p><em>…If I come here together with Shino… right, I probably would think I would like to see her looking happy.</em></p>



<p>While murmuring, Sandai walked around while searching. And then he spotted a kiosk immediately after, so he thought of getting some kind of present.</p>



<p>“You’re going to the kiosk? Is there something you wanna get?”</p>



<p>“Kinda. Wait for me.”</p>



<p>“Okaaay.”</p>



<p>Sandai entered the kiosk alone.</p>



<p>Cut flowers, food products, accessories… It was a kiosk with an unexpectedly abundant assortment, but he ignored bulky stuff, and things that seemed like it would trouble the other party after giving it to them.</p>



<p>For example cut flowers; they looked good, but the care afterwards would be a trouble.</p>



<p>Food products were better to some extent, but still, a lot of it had bulky boxes, so going home with it would be difficult.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Accessories left, huh.”</p>



<p>Sandai zeroed in on accessories and looked through all kinds of it. There were hairpin, earring, necklace, ring and so on.</p>



<p>It wasn’t well-built by any means, and it was also inexpensive for the price, ranging from several hundred yen to several thousand yen. It was truly various items you would expect to find in a kiosk. Perhaps calling it something like a toy one would buy as a gift for children would be an easy-to-understand description.</p>



<p>In regards to whether he would give any of these to Shino… he probably wouldn’t, but it was unnecessary to make the treatment exactly the same either.</p>



<p>Pondering a bit, Sandai decided on a hairpin with a fresh-looking white flower work. Acting fast to buy after deciding on it, he quickly paid the bill and returned to Hajime.</p>



<p>“Welcome back. What did you buy?”</p>



<p>“I went to buy this. I’ll give it to you, Saeki. We’ve come all the way here together, so I thought of giving something to remember, you see.”</p>



<p>Sandai went and put the hair pin on Hajime’s hair.</p>



<p>“This is… a pin?”</p>



<p>Hajime was surprised and looked alternatingly between Sandai and the hairpin while repeatedly blinking; looking troubled at how to response with the sudden present, so to say</p>



<p>“You didn’t go buy a souvenir for Yuizaki-san, or anything like that?”</p>



<p>“Nah, when giving a present to Shino, I’m thinking it’s better to choose it together if possible. It’s best to ask the person in question what she wants, and well, it’s also my own way of reflecting.”</p>



<p>“Reflecting…? Ah, could it be the underwear present you said before? I see, you spent the Eve together with Yuizaki-san, so that means you’ve given it? How was her reaction?”</p>



<p>Hajime knew about the underwear Christmas present because Sandai had ended up asking Hajime about it.</p>



<p>At that time, Sandai had gotten encouraged by Hajime that it would probably be fine.</p>



<p>And it would be pretty unfair to not tell the result, thus Sandai honestly went and told Hajime.</p>



<p>“&#8230;She wasn’t that into it.”</p>



<p>“I see, I see. She wasn’t into it, I see. And so it went fine like I said.”</p>



<p>“You’re right. It was like you said… Really, thank you.”</p>



<p>“No no no, don’t mention it.”</p>



<p>Hajime joined his hands together behind his back, suddenly turned around 180 degrees to the right, and began to walk. And Sandai went and followed after Hajime with light steps.</p>



<p>Afterwards, after more or less looking around inside the botanical garden, they killed some time downtown. When they noticed, it was already dusk.</p>



<p>“Nng… that was fun!”</p>



<p>“It was fun for me, too. Something like this is the first for me, so I felt it’s all the more so.”</p>



<p>Spending time with Hajime had a different kind of fun than when together with Shino. Sandai thought, that the fun of spending time together with a friend surely must feel like this.</p>



<p>As he thought so, the feeling of wanting to become proper friends with Hajime welled up.</p>



<p>Had it been someone outgoing or a partygoer, they probably would realize that they were already friends, but as for Sandai who was clueless in that area, he decided to put it into words.</p>



<p>“Hey… so.”</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“Umm… so.”</p>



<p>“Is there something you wanna say? It’s already getting dark and time to head home, so I’d love it if you quickly say it if you’ve got anything to say.”</p>



<p>Please be my friend—it was only a few words, but it couldn’t easily come out when it was time to put it into words.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Don’t fret. I’m not gonna get mad even if it’s anything weird, you know? ‘Cause you see, I’m someone broad-minded.”</p>



<p>Sandai felt like he had gotten the last push with that, so he made up his mind.</p>



<p>“Please be my frie—”</p>



<p>However, a wind blew right when he had said that much. It was a wind with a good force to it, and that wind simultaneously pulled up Hajime’s jacket and the shirt under.</p>



<p>In that moment, the flow of time was like a slow motion. And then, when Hajime’s chest was almost completely visible—</p>



<p>“—My-My eyes! My eyes!”</p>



<p>For some reason, he got poked in the eyes by Hajime. Thanks to that, Sandai wounded up rolling around on the ground in pain.</p>



<p>“W-Why did you poke my…”</p>



<p>“Well, I just thought it was kinda dangerous just now.”</p>



<p>“Dangerous? W-What was?”</p>



<p>“‘Cause it was almost visible.”</p>



<p>“Almost visible? It certainly felt that way, but we’re fellow guys and… like when changing clothes, you would invite me to do it together, wouldn’t you… I would refuse, but…”</p>



<p>“About that, I thought you’re someone who would refuse, so I’ve just been teasing you with that, though,” Hajime talked softly as if murmuring.</p>



<p>As Sandai was still suffering from the pain in his eyes, he couldn’t catch what Hajime was talking in a low voice, even if Sandai tried to.</p>



<p>It was only after several minutes that the pain finally subsided.</p>



<p>“T-That hurt.”</p>



<p>“Sorry. Was on reflex.”</p>



<p>“On reflex…”</p>



<p>“That’s why sorry. That aside, I didn’t fully hear it but I could tell what it was. Even if you don’t say something like that, we’re already friends, you know?”</p>

<p>Sandai’s eyes were still hazy, but even so, he could just tell that Hajime with the setting sun behind his back was happily smiling.</p>



<p>It was only Sandai who thought that they still weren’t friends. Hajime had thought from earlier that they were friends.</p>



<p>When Sandai realized that, he suddenly lost strength somehow.</p>



<p>“See you later,” Hajime said and waved his hand.</p>
