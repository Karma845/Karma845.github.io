<h3>Chapter 6: 30 December – 3 January Even a New Year Shrine Visit’s Got Stuff Happening, Huh?</h3 

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>The next day after the enjoyable trip with Shino. On the way to his part-time job, Sandai noticed the atmosphere of the city to be completely different.</p>



<p>It was only just about a week since Chrtistmas, but it was already in new year holiday decorations. The Christmas trees were replaced with kagami mochis or Daruma dolls, and wreaths with shimenawas or bamboo works, a complete New Year decor.</p>



<p>In this time period, had it been the average year, it would’ve been around the time where Sandai would have a 24-hour anime watching marathon or read his piled up light novels alone, but… this year it didn’t seem likely he could make the time for that, and somehow keeping track of new works was all he could do.</p>



<p>Rejoice about having fulfilling days in real life, or be sad about the decreased time to enjoy hobbies… Opinions might split in this regard.</p>



<p>Well anyhow, it being end-of-year too, it seemed families came to the aquarium in droves, making Sandai and Hajime also have their hands fairly full with their cleaning work that was originally wouldn’t get so busy.</p>



<p>Trash cans would immediately overflow, and the aquarium glass was full of fingerprints. They would often find lost properties too, and even looked for the parents of a lost child together.</p>



<p>As to be expected, they were slightly worn-out by the time it was their break time.</p>



<p>Not to mention Hajime with whom Sandai was working together, the other staff were also looking tired and hanging their heads down in the office.</p>



<p>This was the kind of time where it would make you want to eat sweet food, so having judged that it was the right time to bring the souvenirs out, Sandai decided to give out the souvenirs he had bought on the trip with Shino,&nbsp;</p>



<p>First off, he gave it to Hajime and Omaki.</p>



<p>“I bought this on a trip. Here you go.”</p>



<p>“You sure? Thanks.”</p>



<p>“You too, Saeki.”</p>



<p>“Yay! Ah, I saw people posting photos of this in SNS before! I forgot which inn it’s from, but it’s a limited stock sold only there, I think… Thanks!”</p>



<p>Next, he gave it to the other staff he knew enough he would greet when seeing them.</p>



<p>“Excuse me. I bought these on a trip, but if you like.”</p>



<p>“You went on a trip, Fujiwara-kun? With parents?”</p>



<p>“It’s with my girlfriend.”</p>



<p>“You look like a quiet one, but sure got it in you, huh. Actually, you’re a high schooler, right? How about like her parents… nah, I guess it doesn’t matter. I figured so. Guess you’re at an age where you’d wanna ignore your parents and have a love escape.”</p>



<p>“I’ve greeted her parents and got their permission, so calling it a love escape really is not…”</p>



<p>“High schoolers these days… sure are scary. Too mature. And being considerate and buying souvenirs like this too, I sure wouldn’t have thought about it when I was a student. All there was in my head was having fun. Ah, I’m not a fan of castella so I’ll take the mizu manju.”</p>



<p>“I’m not a fan of manjus, so I’ll take the castella. Thanks, Fujiwara-kun.”</p>



<p>“At any rate, going on a trip… If I were to go on one in winter, I personally would like to go to a country in the south. I toured Oceania on my college graduation trip, and I sure remember it being fun.”</p>



<p>For the time being, he was done giving it out to the people around he could see.</p>



<p>As for people who would get on their break later, or for people who still hadn’t come and would show up for work later, Sandai decided to ask Omaki to give it out to them as she would often be in the office.</p>



<p>After break time was over, he immediately went back to work. Having a busy time would also make it feel quickly passing by, and just like that it was now evening and the end of his working hours.</p>



<p>Sandai got some free time, so he thought of meeting up with Shino, but a message from Shino came before he could ask her. Just like Christmas, it seemed she would spend the time with her family for end-of-year, and in exchange, she invited him to go visit the shrine together at the beginning of new year. That was the message.</p>



<p>He felt just slightly disappointed to be alone for end-of-year, but being unreasonable just because he was feeling lonely would also lead to a bad relationship with and an opposition from the Yuizaki family.</p>



<p>Sandai had a good impression towards Shino’s parents. They felt like good people to him. Precisely why he wouldn’t want to do anything like causing disruption much, and so he decided to just give up sticking close with Shino for end-of-year.</p>



<p>After having some dinner and getting back to his apartment, Sandai took a bath and leisurely unwinded his tiredness. He did feel something slightly lacking when compared to the hot spring yesterday, but that was the so-called luxury.</p>



<p>After getting out of the bath, he did some home cleaning. Speaking of end-of-year, it would be major cleaning, but he didn’t feel like going full blown to that extent either, so just about more attentively than usual.</p>



<p>After that, he decided to catch up with new animes since he had nothing really to do either. Watching animes was taking quite the stamina, so he was also sorting out what was on his PC and such along with taking a break.</p>



<p>Well, sorting out, but it was just about separating the many porn by the situation, but… as Sandai was doing just that, he was suddenly beginning to feel weird.</p>



<p>He didn’t know as to why, but he somehow was losing interest in the porn on the screen.</p>



<p>Despite the thumping in his chest that seemed impossible to stop even now when remembering the real sex back at the trip, when remembering Shino’s body, the only feeling he held towards the sex on the computer screen was close to <em>nothing</em>.</p>



<p>What was… the meaning of this?</p>



<p>Sandai couldn’t understand.</p>



<p>In order to investigate the true nature of the change in his feelings, he decided to try to delete his most favorite video. As expected, if he were to delete his most favorite, he thought that he would get shaken up to some extent.</p>



<p>But nevertheless, it was <em>nothing</em>. He didn’t feel anything.</p>



<p>“Just what’s up with me?” Sandai unintentionally let out such a murmur, but he immediately understood.</p>



<p>That both his heart and body already couldn’t be satisfied without Shino.</p>



<p>He did feel that he was in a deep crisis on the inside somehow, but it wasn’t like there was any real harm happening, and besides, Shino who he could come into contact with in reality was more important in the first place than the girl on the screen.</p>



<p>There was no problem.</p>



<p>If anything, the decrease of the spending to collect porn was a good thing. He would be able to allocate the freed up money to make memories with Shino.</p>



<p>Strike while the iron is still hot—there was such a saying as well, so Sandai began to delete the lewdness out of his PC one after another. He left out only the video with a girl looking the most like Shino, but about that, how to put this, it was for future reference.</p>



<p>In the meantime, a chat message with a photo from Shino came in. It was a photo of Miki eating soba noodles.</p>






<p>&gt;Miki’s kinda cute today.</p>







<p>Miki was an energetic mischievous girl, but if judged from a photo alone, she would easily look like an angel.</p>



<p>If she were to be more well-behaved in her personality as well, she could probably really become a lovable girl, though… no, there could be people who would like her mischievous part, so it probably would be a case-by-case situation.</p>







<p>&gt;By the way, about the new year shrine visit… Miki’s saying she wants to come along too, and now I’m not sure what to do.</p>







<p>Without missing a beat, an additional chat message from Shino came in. It seemed Miki was throwing a tantrum, wanting to come along with Sandai and Shino for the new year shrine visit.</p>



<p>Sandai immediately replied:</p>



<p>&gt;I don’t really mind, though.</p>



<p>He certainly did feel like being treated like a toy and such by Miki, but while that may be true, it didn’t mean that he hated it.</p>



<p>Besides, Miki knew various things about Sandai that Shino didn’t. So that he wouldn&#8217;t get tattled on, it would be necessary too to curry favor with Miki to some extent.</p>



<p>He didn’t think Shino would believe Miki’s tattle, but still, the plan was to avoid every trouble that could be avoided in advance as much as possible.</p>







<p>&gt;Don’t you think Miki-chan also wants to have fun together with you too once in a while? Since you’re starting dating me, the time you spend with her decreases, doesn’t it?</p>



<p>&gt;Ah… well that’s true.</p>



<p>&gt;Miki-chan’s probably feeling lonely, too. It’s also possible she’d go, ‘Onee-chan got stolen from Miki!’ right?</p>



<p>&gt;Miki doesn’t have a cute personality like that, though… Just probably, but if she goes with Mom and Dad, it’ll be to somewhere close and she doesn’t like it because it’s lame and stuff, something like that. Also, she probably wants to brag.</p>



<p>&gt;Brag?</p>



<p>&gt;It’s shooo obvious she wants to brag to her friends or something like, I went to the city, or like I got to hang out with my big sister’s boyfriend and stuff.</p>







<p>Although he wasn’t sure whether that would be something to be bragged about, at least Miki seemed to judge it would. And then probably, the reason wasn’t just because it would become something to be bragged about, but it was possible she was thinking something along this line as well: <em>because it’s fun watching those two.</em></p>



<p>Anyhow, only the person herself would know of her own intention. As a matter of fact, Miki only knows.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>The 1st of January, the day of the new year shrine visit arrived.</p>



<p>Barely any people could be seen in the city, as if the hustle and bustle from the last few days had just been a lie.</p>



<p>It seemed there had been a lot of people rushing back to their hometown from the evening of the 31st into the night, or people just staying at home even if they stayed in the city, causing the population density to drop down all at once.</p>



<p>Sandai had been busy with his part-time job and stuff at end-of-year, but for the beginning of the year, his workplace would be closed, and the same for the cafe Shino was working at.</p>



<p>Although particular places opening up for business at the start of the year might be crowded, places such as an aquarium or cafe wouldn’t have that many customers even if they were to be open. And everyone would head in the direction for new year shrine visit, so something like a shrine fair would get all the people anyway.</p>



<p>It seemed places like a retail chain store would open for business without any worry, but there were no small amounts of other kinds of shops or establishments closed either. Depending on the situation, this period could also be used to call their suppliers for equipment inspection, repairs, and such.</p>



<p>When Sandai arrived at Shino and Miki’s home to pick them up, he found them both in a long-sleeved kimono.</p>



<p>Miki didn’t seem any different despite the different attire, but… Shino had an indescribable charm different from the usual.</p>



<p>The reason was probably her hairstyle. She was using a flower scrunchie to tie her to the back and wearing an ornamental hairpin. Her nape could be seen, making it somehow sexy.</p>



<p>“Miki, your obi’s kinda off. I’ll fix it so stand still.”</p>



<p>“It’s off? You’re not just mistaken, Onee-chan?”</p>



<p>“I’m nooot~. It’s really off.”</p>



<p>“Then quickly fix it.”</p>



<p>“That’s not the attitude when someone’s doing it for you…”</p>



<p>Despite sighing tiringly, Shino began to fix Miki’s obi. Shino seemed harsh to Miki, but she really was very caring, basically.</p>



<p>As Sandai was waiting for Miki’s kimono to be fixed, Neko peeked out from inside the tofu shop.</p>



<p>“Fujiwara-kun, thank you for looking after Miki, too.”</p>



<p>“No, it’s really fine… And I also think that Miki-chan probably wants to have fun together with Shino, too.”</p>



<p>“Rather than have fun ‘together with’ Shino, I think Miki wants to have fun ‘with’ Shino, though… Well, please take care of them. The truth is, I want to have Daigo-san to say his thanks too, but he’s out for delivery for a bit and will be back in an hour or two. Once that’s done, there won’t be any more work for today, though.”</p>



<p>While smiling wryly, Neko went back inside since she still had a little bit of stuff to do. And around this time, Miki’s kimono was done getting fixed.</p>



<p>With a relaxed atmosphere, they got on the train and headed for a new year shrine visit. The location was the big shrine on the subcenter.</p>



<p>Although near Sandai’s home or the commercial area seemed rather deserted, the shrine was crowded with people.</p>



<p>They bowed and went to go through the torii gate. They were paying attention to not walk straight down the center. Once they arrived before the altar, they gave a monetary offering, rang the bell, clapped their hands, and prayed with their hands pressed. Sandai did feel like a bow or two was necessary before clapping hands, but he decided to not mind the minor detail.</p>



<p>And it was then.</p>



<p>Miki tugged Sandai’s sleeve and quietly whispered to his ear.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Onii-chan. About the underwear Miki picked out.”</p>



<p>The lingerie Christmas present that Sandai had given was something he had had Miki pick out.</p>



<p>Although it had been Sandai who had ultimately decided to buy and pay for it, it was also the truth that Miki had been involved there.</p>



<p>“At home she’s staring at that underwear and always grinning. You did it, huh.”</p>



<p>Shino had shown him wearing the lingerie back on the trip, so he had sensed that she had been fairly pleased with it, but to think that she had liked it enough to grin…</p>



<p>“What’s the matter, you two?” Shino asked and tilted her head.</p>



<p>Sandai and Miki waved both of their hands, denying anything happening.</p>



<p>“It’s nothing. Right? Onii-chan.”</p>



<p>“Right. It’s nothing.”</p>



<p>“By the way, Onii-chan and Onee-chan, what did you pray for?”</p>



<p>Miki nicely changed the subject. Without any reason to miss out on her quick-wittedness, Sandai immediately jumped on it.</p>



<p>“I prayed that Shino and I could always be together I guess.”</p>



<p>“If so, then I also prayed that I could aaaalways be together with you~.”</p>



<p>“Haaah… setting aside Miki knowing from the start and enduring this puke-inducing sweetness… Miki wants to draw fortune slip!”</p>



<p>“Fortune slip, huh…”</p>



<p>“Come to think of it, we still haven’t drawn one, haven’t we.”</p>



<p>They still hadn’t got a fortune slip. It would be important to have this year’s luck foretold, and it&nbsp; would also feel disappointing to not draw one when coming for a new year shrine visit, so they decided to go for it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>They tried to draw a fortune slip, and it was excellent luck for Sandai and Shino. Especially romantic luck, it was a wonderful one for both.</p>



<p>On Sandai’s fortune slip was: <em>If you are in a relationship, that person is a once-in-a-lifetime good match that will never appear again in your life, so don’t let them go</em>.</p>



<p>On Shino’s fortune slip was: <em>You will be together with the one you are in a relationship with currently for a lifetime without ever having a fight</em>.</p>



<p>It was a very joyous one.</p>



<p>However, in contrast to those two, Miki had drawn <em>very bad luck</em>. Miki’s cheeks were twitching, and even her brows were slightly twitching as well.</p>



<p>“Why only Miki’s ‘very bad luck’? Moreover, money luck is just awful. You will lose fivefold if you are greedy so be careful, it says.”</p>



<p>Considering Miki’s behavior on the daily, very bad luck would even seem like a just-right caution, though… however, when seeing her making a face that could burst into crying at any moment now, it was somehow pitiful.</p>



<p>Since it couldn’t be helped, Sandai decided and said he would give Miki money, giving her another chance to draw one more time.</p>



<p>“Eh? You’re giving Miki money? Onii-chan, is it really okay?”</p>



<p>“I’m sure you’ll get excellent luck next.”</p>



<p>“Yaay! Thanks!”</p>



<p>When he handed the 500 yen, Miki went straight to the place selling the fortune slip.</p>



<p>Immediately after, “Haaah,” Shino sighed, having watched the whole thing. “I’ve said it before, but you don’t have to go that far for Miki~. She&#8217;s just gonna get carried away.”</p>



<p>“You say that but she’s just a kid.”</p>



<p>“You’re just too kind… geez.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nevertheless, Shino looked somewhat happy as well.</p>



<p>The truth was that she probably wanted to be strict with Miki, but it seemed the warm feeling from seeing her boyfriend&#8217;s kindness won instead.</p>



<p>Seeing Shino softly smiling, Sandai realized he hadn’t complimented Shino’s part of hard work today.</p>



<p>“&#8230;You seem different today and sure got a cuteness different from the usual. The ornamental hairpin is cute, too.”</p>



<p>“Oh, could it be you finally noticed?”</p>



<p>“I just wasn’t sure when to say it.”</p>



<p>“Thanks… Let’s hold hands.”</p>



<p>Getting into lovey-dovey mode one way or another, they firmly joined hands and nestled close together.</p>







<p><em>“It’s excellent luck!”</em></p>







<p>And Miki’s shout of joy could be heard, apparently getting excellent luck somehow.</p>



<p>Now then, the new year shrine visit would end with this, but… they decided to have a little fun and didn’t immediately go back. Perhaps expecting the waves of people visiting the shrine, not only were there food stalls in the area, but also places to have fun, such as a place where people could try their hands on calligraphy or taiko drumming, have karuta cards competition, and even something like have a competition on a huge sugoroku board game where real people actually the one advancing.</p>



<p>“Onee-chan! Onee-chan! Miki wants to participate in the sugoroku competition! It needs 2,000 yen, but Miki doesn’t bring that kinda money, so please!”</p>



<p>“Money money money… You had Sandai pay for the fortune slip earlier, and now me? Actually, isn’t 2,000 yen for one game too expensive? Just give up.”</p>



<p>“The fortune slip and sugoroku are different!”</p>



<p>“No matter what you say, I won’t—”</p>



<p>“—It’ll become a fond memory! Please please please! Think of it for Miki’s fond memory!”</p>



<p>Miki repeatedly bowed her head. Shino was making an awfully displeased face, but seeing the tears in the corners of Miki’s eyes, Shino eventually yielded.</p>



<p>“Haaah… good grief… this won’t be good for you,” or so Shino said, but she had the personality that would end up yielding when getting strongly begged.</p>



<p>And Miki probably grasped that. That was why she judged that she could take the offensive and dared to go through it with a sob story.</p>



<p>“All right, Miki’s gonna go now.”</p>



<p>Having gotten the money, Miki’s crying face instantly turned into a smiling face, and she lined up in the participants queue at the sugoroku venue.</p>



<p>“That Miki… what’s with that smiling face.”</p>



<p>“You got fooled, huh.”</p>



<p>“Damn it~ I’m not gonna get tricked next time!”</p>



<p>Shino made such a determination, but she would probably get used by Miki in various ways and get fooled again, for sure.</p>



<p>Leaving that aside, both Sandai and Shino didn’t participate in the sugoroku game, so they decided to take a seat at the prepared audience seating and watch Miki playing sugoroku.</p>



<p>“Well, it’s also for creating memories for Miki this time, so I guess it can’t be helped.”</p>



<p>“For saying all this and that to me, you yourself sure are pretty soft to Miki-chan. What a kind big sister.”</p>



<p>“You sound kinda thorny… ah, could it be that you’re jealous of Miki?”</p>



<p>It was just a bit of teasing and not at all words coming out of jealousy, but apparently it ended up looking that way to Shino.</p>



<p>As for correcting it… not even needed. Even if it was wrong, what to say at a time like this would be: <em>that’s right</em>.</p>



<p>“I guess I am. I love you so much that I don’t want Miki-chan to take you away from me.”</p>



<p>“You’re so hopeless. Here.”</p>



<p>Shino spread both her arms. Come here, she said. Sandai went to hug Shino and immediately put his lips on top of hers.</p>



<p>It would end up like this, so it would be fine not correcting it.</p>



<p>As sickly sweet mood was filling up the space, a person sitting on the next seat noticing that shouted, “I WANT A GIRLFRIEND TOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!” and ran away while holding his head.</p>



<p>They didn’t notice that, and after smooch-smooch enjoying their kisses, they continued their talk.</p>



<p>“Speaking of which, how was the reaction for the souvenirs at your part-time job? It didn’t feel so bad at mine, though…”</p>



<p>“So-so I guess… Actually, when I said I went on a trip with you, many were more interested in hearing about how the trip was rather than the souvenirs.”</p>



<p>At Shino’s part-time job, rather than the souvenirs itself, it seemed <em>story </em>souvenirs had been more popular.</p>



<p>“I talked a bunch, but the one that got them most excited was when I talked about how you were being gentle with me on our first sex, I guess. And I bragged, too!”</p>



<p>For the creatures called girls, even love affairs would end up liven up the conversation, apparently.</p>



<p>Sandai could think of it only as an embarrassing topic to both hear or talk about, however, listening carefully, he understood that there was an appropriate reason for girls to like such a topic.</p>



<p>“Well, talking about something like this is curbing, though.”</p>



<p>“Curbing?”</p>



<p>“You know, girls are just really complicated about romance stuff. There are also the so-called girls with a hobby of snatching away someone else’s boyfriend, so like bragging and indirectly saying ‘I’m all over one another with my boyfriend so there’s no gap or anything for you to make a move’ is just right.”</p>



<p>It was something that would make you doubt and inadvertently think whether there really was such a girl, but when taking a look at reality, it was not at all weird.</p>



<p>For example, such a scenario where just about everyone should have witnessed once in their childhood: multiple girls fighting over one boy.</p>



<p>In a kindergarten, nursery school, it could be at any place, but anyhow, that scramble doesn’t start just because of: <em>I like that boy</em>.</p>



<p>There are also girls who participate with such a reason: <em>a boy who is popular with everyone or who is liked by someone and such is starting to look attractive, and I don’t have interest in him as the opposite sex, but it’s making me want him.</em></p>



<p>It’s a kind of habit, but there are also a lot of people with such a habit who aren&#8217;t cured of it even after becoming an adult. The perfect example is the case where the woman was the first one to speak up in a celebrity adultery scandal that would make a headline in weekly magazines or news occasionally.</p>



<p>In short, disclosure of a love affair is one part of the countermeasure to eliminate any such openings—when thinking so, even Sandai could easily come to understand it.</p>



<p>In the meantime that they were having such a talk about girls&#8217; circumstances, it seemed the sugoroku had been proceeding well, as Miki somehow had reached the finish line in first place before they realized it.</p>



<p>Apparently there was some kind of prize for first place as Miki brought back an exchange ticket. We were talking about Miki who would tend to be greedy, so she must be unbearably overjoyed… though, there was a cloud over her face for some reason.</p>



<p>“Miki-chan, you got first place but don’t look happy, huh? What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;This exchange ticket.”</p>



<p>Miki showed the exchange ticket. On the exchange ticket was written that it would be possible to exchange it for a heated steam microwave oven combo capable of two-level cooking.</p>



<p>It was a high-end home appliance in the six-digit yen, but… also understandably not something Miki had an interest in. She probably would rather be given the money instead of such a thing.</p>



<p>Though, it wasn’t that bad of a prize. There was also someone who would be pleased with something like this. So close by.</p>



<p>“Aren’t you amazing, Miki! This thing’s expensive~!”</p>



<p>As someone with a hobby of cooking and confectionery making, Shino was looking really happy.</p>



<p>“It’s not something Miki alone can claim anyway, that said not something Miki wants either so Miki’ll give to you, Onee-chan…”</p>



<p>“Thanks~ I love you so much!”</p>



<p>From Shino’s perspective, she had just given out 2,000 yen and it came back into something she wanted costing in the six-digit yen, so no doubt she felt like she had just won a lottery.</p>



<p>Now then, time passed and it was now evening. It happened on their way back; during the time Shino was headed to the toilet, Miki spoke to Sandai.</p>



<p>“What’s up?”</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, don’t you remember the promise with Miki?”</p>



<p>“Promise?”</p>



<p>“The Christmas present underwear, if Onee-chan’s happy with it, you promised to pay Miki extra. She really is happy with it, so the promised extra please.”</p>



<p>Now he remembered it.</p>



<p>He certainly had made such a promise.</p>



<p>It was also certain that breaking a promise with a kid wouldn’t be good in terms of their education, so Sandai decided to give her the extra reward that served as a New Year’s gift as well.</p>



<p>As to be expected, 10,000 yen would be too much and also a painful expense for Sandai, so just several 1,000 yen bills.</p>



<p>Before Shino returned, Sandai hurried to the nearby convenience store, bought a New Year’s gift paper envelope, put the bills inside, and gave it to Miki.</p>



<p>“Fuheh…”</p>



<p>When Miki checked the bills in the envelope, she flicked and counted it with her fingers and then grinned.</p>



<p>When thinking of education, Sandai felt like it would’ve been better to throw away the promise and not give it to Miki in her case, but… he had given it already. Nothing could be done at this point.</p>



<p>“Hmm? Miki, somehow you’re making a creepy smile, though?”</p>



<p>“It’s nothing~. It’s nothing to do with you, Onee-chan.”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>Only Shino knew nothing. However, it should be better for Shino to not know. At the very least that was how Sandai felt.</p>
