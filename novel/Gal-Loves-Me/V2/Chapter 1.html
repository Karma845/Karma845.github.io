<h3>Chapter 1: 23 November – 1 December  Let’s Do Our Best for the Finals</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>He had decided to spend all of the available time, whether it be their chill time in his apartment, break periods at school or any other free time, on Shino’s studies.</p>



<p>It was to the point that it seemed a bit excessive. Even in the classroom, their classmates began to talk about it as well.</p>




<p><em>“Say, Yuizaki-san’s a regular in supplementary class, but that didn’t seem to concern her, though…”</em></p>



<p><em>“Looks like Fujiwara’s helping her study while making scary faces, but can he even? Is he just trying to look good just because he’s Yuizaki’s boyfriend?”</em></p>



<p><em>“He would without hesitation give the correct answer instantly when get picked in class, and he would also secretly help Yuizaki-san when she’s in trouble when the teacher picks her from time to time, so Fujiwara-kun’s gotta be pretty smart, no?”</em></p>



<p><em>“For real? …Man, I wanna help Yuizaki study, too. Like, lemme help you learn this one practical skill in PE class. Guhehe.”</em></p>



<p><em>“You creep. Isn’t that why you can’t get a girlfriend? Go learn from Fujiwara-kun. He doesn’t look like he’s thinking any lewd stuff.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I think someone like Fujiwara got a high chance to be a closet pervert, though?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Eww… Your jealousy is leaking trying to bring down someone’s boyfriend’s reputation like that. It’s creeping me out. Your personality is so awful I got goosebumps.”</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s not like I’m trying to bring down Fujiwara’s reputation or anything like that!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Shino’s an idiot, so I think it’s impossible no matter how hard Fujiwara tries, though. It’s just totally useless to do anything for a supplementary class regular like us.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Shino, that is the name of the biggest dummy in our dummies corps.”</em></p>






<p>Sandai was also aware that they were being talked about by their surroundings. However, his vague anxiety about not having enough time was so big that he didn’t have the spare time to care about people’s eyes on them.</p>



<p>Instead, right now it was more important to think about how to secure more study time for Shino.</p>



<p>Sandai was thinking as he watched Shino having a staring game with a textbook and workbook.</p>



<p>With a day or two passing by, it was when Sandai saw a running train through the classroom window that an idea flashed through his mind.</p>



<p>“I see… that can give more time to spend on study. It was so simple. Shino, can I have a minute?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’m doing what you told me, okay? I’m not slacking off, okay? I’m giving it my very best.”</p>



<p>“I can tell that from looking. It’s not about that, please listen; starting today, I’ll walk you to your home and not to the station.”</p>



<p>Shino stared blankly at Sandai’s sudden proposal.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Eh? What’s up so suddenly? I&#8217;d be happy if you would walk me all the way home, but… I think it’s gonna be rough, you know? The date might change by the time you get back to your apartment.”</p>



<p>Sandai also knew that it would take Shino an hour to go to school by train alone, and about two hours for a round trip, but the proposal was for this reason as well.</p>



<p>So Sandai immediately replied, “I don’t mind.”</p>



<p>“Uwh… nn.”</p>



<p>Looking anxious, Shino frowned, folded her arms, and pouted. She seemed to be thinking about something.</p>



<p>“Will it be inconveniencing you?”</p>



<p>“I know I’ve said it before, but my home is like, at a place where it’ll take an hour by train alone… it’s in the countryside way past the suburb…”</p>



<p>It seemed Shino’s concern was that her home wasn’t in an urban area, and Sandai somehow started to see what Shino was thinking.</p>



<p>Shino was probably thinking about such a thing like, what to do if he were to make fun of her and what to do if he got disillusioned.</p>



<p>However, Shino should know as well that Sandai wasn’t the kind of man who would care about that. That said, she was simply worried and feeling anxious about the what-ifs.</p>



<p>At a time like this, it would be best to quickly get rid of her anxiety.</p>



<p>“Countryside? What about it?”</p>



<p>After Sandai conveyed that he wouldn’t care no matter where her home would be, Shino breathed out a sigh of relief for having received the final push. “I see. Yeah, you really won’t care about that. I guess I’ll take you up on that then.”</p>



<p>Sandai smiled, and then Shino broke into a broad, lovely smile. It seemed as a girl Shino was also happy to have her boyfriend walk her to her home.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, even Shino would realize it sooner—that this was a one-way ticket to hell…</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>Picking Shino up after her part-time job, spending couple-time in his apartment, and then seeing her off at the station—that was Sandai’s usual routine.</p>



<p>However, such a routine was now on hold until the end of the finals. Spending all the available time for Shino’s test preparation, and then zeroing in also on the traveling time on the train during which Shino was supposed to be able to take a step back from studying to take a breather—he was semi forcibly making her open a textbook and workbook.</p>



<p>At this very second on a shaking train, Sandai was helping Shino study.</p>



<p>“Damn it… you said you’ll walk me home, but it’s actually for this?”</p>



<p>“You finally noticed?”</p>



<p>“I was so sure you wanted to increase the time for flirting with me…”</p>



<p>“I do want to increase our time together too, but right now it’s all about making good use of available time for studying. Don’t you think this is an efficient use of time?”</p>



<p>“R-Right.”</p>



<p>Sandai nodded satisfyingly, but Shino’s cheek was twitching.</p>



<p>“Uwh~.”</p>



<p>“Come on, open the next page.”</p>



<p>“Wait! I wanna do just one more question from this one!”</p>



<p>“I see. Alright then, we’ll move on after you solve that.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Okay.”</p>



<p>In her own way, Shino seemed to be firmly aware that they <em>didn’t have time</em>, and proceeded with the studying as Sandai said despite complaining.</p>



<p>However, it was certain that studying wasn’t something Shino was used to, and Sandai could tell from the air around her that she was accumulating a considerable amount of stress.</p>



<p>So far, Sandai had only given Shino the stick, and the time seemed about right to finally throw in the carrot.</p>



<p>Still, even if Sandai were to mention the carrot, his weak imagination couldn’t even come up with any ideas of what kind of carrot would be best…</p>



<p>For now, Sandai tried to look up <em>how to cheer up your girlfriend</em> on his phone. And then many things came out.</p>



<p>The internet is convenient. It can give you all kinds of insights into matters that are difficult for you to figure out on your own.</p>



<p>That said, it is by no means all-mighty, and every article could also contain content that is contrary to one another. Just as it had been the case with the Christmas present, this time was also the same; the more he surfed on the sea of internet, the less he understood what the right answer would be.</p>



<p>At a time like this, you should give up the approach of trying to find the correct answer on your own. Instead of poorly adding an element of surprise, it is best to ask the person directly. And Sandai understood that after having gained all kinds of experiences.</p>



<p>“Hey Shino, it’s sudden, but I think a reward is needed for when you avoid failing.”</p>



<p>“Uwh?” Shino broke into a small grin, and her ears twitched. However, it was only for a moment that she showed that happy expression. “The thought makes me happy, but I don’t need it.” Shino’s reply was short.</p>



<p>“You don’t want one?”</p>



<p>“Like, you always try to do something for me, but if you keep doing that, your wallet’s just gonna get lighter.”</p>



<p>Shino was apparently worried about the condition of Sandai’s wallet, but… that worry of hers was unnecessary.</p>



<p>Sandai was supposed to start his part-time job at the aquarium on the 1st of December, and the earnings from that part-time job was paid every 25th, with the earnings cut-off at the 15th. In other words, he should have a decent sum of money available at the end of next month, so he could expect to have the funds for the reward.</p>



<p>After being told the matter by Sandai, “Eh?” Shino was surprised. “You’re starting a part-time job?”</p>



<p>“It’s gonna start at the beginning of next month or so.”</p>



<p>“That’s soon! Why didn’t you tell me?”</p>



<p>“I was going to tell you one of these days. It was fairly recently too that I got the job.”</p>



<p>“What’ll happen with you picking me up after I’m done with my job…?”</p>



<p>“I’ll only work the hours that’ll let me pick you up in time.”</p>



<p>“I see. By the way, where is it? What will you be doing? Are there any girls?”</p>



<p>Sandai noticed that Shino had narrowed her eyes. His instinct told him that this would be the part where he must not make a mistake in his reply.</p>



<p>He knew that Shino had a strong jealousy and possessiveness precisely because he was her boyfriend.</p>



<p>“My part-time job is at an aquarium that’ll be newly opened. I will be there doing cleaning. There is a woman. The vice director who was the interviewer was a woman. And other than her… it’s possible there’ll be more among those I haven’t seen and greeted yet. It’s just that my job will be cleaning. I won’t get involved with people.”</p>



<p>“That vice director, how old is she?”</p>



<p>“How old was she again… I feel like I’ve heard it, but I don’t remember since it went in one ear and out the other. I do recall hearing it about two or three times, but I can’t remember.”</p>



<p>Sandai chose his words as carefully as possible so as not to upset Shino. By the way, he wasn’t lying, and the fact that he didn’t remember the vice director’s, Komaki, age was also the truth.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I wanna see you working once the aquarium opens, so can I come?”</p>



<p>At the same time Sandai felt the silent pressure from Shino that was like, <em>if there’s nothing to hide, of course I can, right?</em>, a slight unrest spread within him.</p>



<p>He was slightly worried about how Shino would react to Hajime. Shino got no mercy towards guys either.</p>



<p>That said, getting flustered right here right now would only cause unnecessary suspicions. Calmly, Sandai maintained his usual expression.</p>



<p>“I don’t think it’s gonna be very interesting to see me working, you know?”</p>



<p>“It’s not about if it’s interesting or not! I wanna see!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Oh, I see.”</p>



<p>Sandai pushed his brain into full throttle.</p>



<p>And then he realized a certain fact; he would finish his job before Shino = impossible for Shino to come to the aquarium while he would be on the job.</p>



<p>Having realized there was nothing to be afraid of, Sandai judged that he should welcome Shino’s wish, as well as in order to not cause a sense of discomfort.</p>



<p>“Alright. I’ll look forward to it.”</p>



<p>“Okay!”</p>



<p>Relieved that he had somehow managed to make his way through after seeing Shino happily giving a nod, Sandai decided to get back to the topic before he could ruin it.</p>



<p>“Anyway, that means I’ll have the funds for it. So don’t be reserved. I’m gonna straight up tell you myself if it’s an unreasonable request.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“That’s right. No need for it to be now. Let’s see, once the tests are over and you manage to avoid failing, then let’s think about it again.”</p>



<p>“If you’re insisting that much, then I guess I’ll just have to accept the reward. Thanks.”</p>



<p>After making Shino understand that there would be no need to worry about the condition of his wallet, Sandai seemed to have gotten her to agree. Although there was some reluctance, Shino would be receiving a reward from Sandai.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>Now then, since the digression had come to a stop, Sandai continued to help Shino study on the train without a break.</p>



<p>Time flew by just like that, and they were approaching the station near Shino’s home.</p>



<p>When Sandai looked out the window of the train car, he could see street lights placed at regular intervals and what appeared to be a small shopping district.</p>



<p>Click clack, the shaking train gradually slowed down and finally came to a stop. The name of the station came on the announcer, and the door opened, pssssh.</p>



<p>Shino tidied up the opened workbook, put it into her bag, and got off the train. Sandai got off as well following after her.</p>



<p>It was a slightly rural, countryside town you could find everywhere. Even after exiting the station, there were no buildings that would stand out, but a row of stores with signboard lights lit up dimly.</p>



<p>“My house is that way.”</p>



<p>Where Shino pointed at was the shopping district that could be seen from the train just earlier.</p>



<p>“The shopping district?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. There’s a tofu seller there, and it’s that one.”</p>



<p>“Tofu seller?”</p>



<p>“That’s right. It’s a store that looks like it’s going under, though. It’s also only open for about two to three hours a day.”</p>



<p>“Two to three hours, that’s a very short opening hour, huh.”</p>



<p>“We’re doing the making and delivery, so we don’t have that much time to open the store either. But we’re in the countryside, so no one comes in even if we open the store.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I see.”</p>



<p>“And like that, Dad and Mom alone have somehow managed… It&#8217;s just, even if they’re busy with deliveries, tofu is cheap to begin with, so it can’t make money, and life’s pretty rough, so that’s why I’m working a part-time job at another place to try to cover for my own share by myself.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You did say it before. You said you were working because you didn’t have that much money.”</p>



<p>Sandai clearly remembered the day when he had heard about it from Shino.</p>



<p>Shino suddenly showing up at his apartment since the train had stopped because of the typhoon, ending up with her staying the night, playing a game together, and then a power outage happening…</p>



<p>It was one unforgettable day.</p>



<p>“At any rate, you do have it rough, huh.”</p>



<p>“I really do.”</p>



<p>“It’s good that you’re honest. Speaking of, does that mean you can eat tofu all you want then?”</p>



<p>“I can eat tofu all I want, but I don’t eat that much tofu…”</p>



<p>“You don’t like it?”</p>



<p>“No, I don’t dislike it, and I used to eat a fair amount of it until middle school first year, but… hmmm… it’s just… well… you know.”</p>



<p>“If you don’t dislike it, you can just eat it, right?”</p>



<p>“There was something that bothered me, and so I stopped eating it trying to do something about it.” Shino’s cheeks gradually dyed red, and she looked down bashfully. “&#8230;Will you promise you totally won’t laugh?”</p>



<p>Sandai couldn’t really understand why she had to ask him so, but the person in question didn’t want him to laugh. Then he would have to do just that.</p>



<p>“I promise,” Sandai replied immediately. “I won’t laugh.”</p>



<p>And then Shino gulped down her saliva, as if resolving herself.</p>



<p>“You see, I learned that eating tofu makes boobs bigger, so I stopped eating it.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;My boobs started getting bigger and bigger around the upper grades of elementary school, and that pretty bothered me, so I was thinking about what to do to stop it getting any bigger, and before I knew it I was a middle schooler, and so, while I was researching it on my phone I happened to see something that said eating tofu will make boobs bigger… and so I stopped eating it.”</p>



<p>Having not expected such a talk, Sandai was troubled on how to reply. He even started to regret that he shouldn’t have asked.</p>



<p>“I-I see…”</p>



<p>“Mm-hmm. And you know, I really disliked my boobs being big. I couldn’t hide it like when in swimming class, and there were boys who would gawk at me… and I would lie every time that I had my period and skip swimming class.”</p>



<p>Kids—boys especially are honest for better or worse. Shino had a cute face, and big chest in addition to that, so she must have had eyes constantly glued to her.</p>



<p>Sandai suddenly remembered what Shino had told him previously, about how she had stopped doing SNS because of the constant DM coming in.</p>



<p>Shino was bad with men other than Sandai, but there was a reasonable past and reason leading to that, and that was a deep wound for Shino.</p>



<p>And then probably, such experience was also connected to the jealousy and possessiveness Shino would show.</p>



<p>Instinctively judging that Sandai was a rare guy who was different from regular guys making her not want to let him go—there was a hint that Shino seemed to be thinking so unconsciously.</p>



<p>“Seems like you’ve been through a lot. I’d like to say it’s useless to keep worrying about that, but if being told that would stop you worrying, you wouldn&#8217;t have a hard time either.”</p>



<p>In his own way, Sandai tried to find words that Shino might be looking for—to avoid hurting her, and to ease her mind as much as possible.</p>



<p>That said, Sandai couldn’t immediately be subtle about it. He wasn’t that flawless of a guy.</p>



<p>“Having said that, body issues are complicated. If you want to make it smaller, we’re talking about surgery and stuff.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“What a difficult one.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Could it be that you’re trying to say something considerate? Even if you don’t do that, just being willing to listen is enough for me, you know? It’s making me feel so much better just being able to say what I couldn’t say to anyone else.”</p>



<p>Sandai ended up looking surprised because of her reply, and smiled bitterly.</p>



<p>Sandai was originally a loner who was bad at socializing, and he also had the confidence in his skill of keeping what he was thinking from showing on his face, but… sometimes Shino would see through what Sandai was thinking surprisingly easily.</p>



<p>“This is my home.”</p>



<p>&nbsp;In the meantime, they arrived at Shino’s home.</p>



<p>It was a two-story wooden building that looked fairly old. It also had a tofu seller signboard put up.</p>



<p>“By the way… I think it’s late to bring this up, but…”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“Could it be that I should greet your parents today?”</p>



<p>“Didn’t you walk me all the way home also because you got the readiness to even meet my parents?”</p>



<p>“I’ve been thinking that eventually I’ll meet your parents given the chance. But even if that’s the case, I think doing it late at night is wrong in a lot of ways.”</p>



<p>Sandai did think faintly that the event of him greeting Shino’s parents, saying hello to them would come someday.</p>



<p>However, he felt that that should be during the day. If he were to introduce himself as her boyfriend when it was late at night like now, it seemed like that would create a bad impression, thus he wanted to avoid it if possible.</p>



<p>“I’ll greet them at a proper time during the day.”</p>



<p>“Both my mom and dad know I’m home late because of my job, and I feel like it’d be fine if I say you were just walking me home as my boyfriend because it’s not safe at night, though… no, but, speaking of which, I haven’t told them about you.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“I’ve been thinking I should properly tell them, so I think this is a good chance. I’ve gotta prepare myself, too. If I keep silent about it, Miki might just end up telling them on her own, and I don’t want that. Wait a bit, I’ll go call—”</p>



<p>“—P-Please wait!”</p>



<p>Sandai hurriedly hugged Shino as she tried to unlock the store’s entrance and go inside.</p>



<p>“Wha wha… w-what?”</p>



<p>“Now’s not a good time. I want it during the day.”</p>



<p>“Even though you’ve come all the way here…?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I want it during the day, not at night.”</p>



<p>Sandai wasn’t so fussy usually—of course Shino knew that as well.</p>



<p>For this reason, she immediately realized what was behind Sandai’s fussiness: he actually still needed more time to get mentally prepared.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I don’t have a choice, don’t I? I get it.”</p>



<p>Although Shino seemed regretful, she listened to Sandai nevertheless.</p>



<p>Though, “In return for listening to your request, listen to one request I have,” she offered up a condition. “Make sure you give me a goodbye kiss today too, okay?”</p>



<p>“Eh… but aren’t we in front of your…”</p>



<p>“Do it.”</p>



<p>Shino closed her eyes and lifted up her jaw, and Sandai was at a loss. He had nothing at all against kissing itself, but the location still was an issue.</p>



<p>There was a slight possibility that Shino’s parents would come out by chance and go: what on earth does this mean?</p>



<p>That said, Sandai also understood Shino’s feelings.</p>



<p>Shino was saying that she absolutely wanted the goodbye kiss which they had always been having, and would hate to have that put on hold for some little risk.</p>



<p>From Shino’s perspective, it would be unbearable not being able to do the important kiss.</p>



<p>So, although there was a lot of worry, Sandai ultimately kissed Shino on the lips.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Nn…”</p>



<p>Although normally there was an unspoken agreement of kissing until each side was satisfied, this time Sandai quickly pulled away from Shino, in part due to the very strong nervousness and worry of his.</p>



<p>Shino was miffed, seemingly unsatisfied that the unspoken rule had been broken.</p>



<p>However—</p>



<p>“Isn’t it kinda short?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Please don’t be mean.”</p>



<p>Sandai looked away with a troubled look. And perhaps understanding that she couldn’t pursue it further, Shino also stopped making any complaint.</p>



<p>“I guess just now was a little selfish of me. Sorry—take care on your way home.”</p>



<p>While scratching his cheek, Sandai saw off Shino giving a small wave and walking inside through the store’s entrance.</p>



<p>And that was when—</p>



<p>A laughter could be heard from the second floor of Shino’s home. Sandai looked up by reflex, and there was a girl looking at him and bursting out laughing.</p>



<p>It was Miki, Shino’s little sister.</p>



<p>She was a girl who had an awfully cheeky personality, and a girl with an interesting, quirky personality in all sorts of ways.</p>



<p>Since their relationship was like acquaintances, Sandai didn’t understand why Miki was laughing.</p>



<p>There… was no particular reason for it.</p>



<p>She found it somehow funny that Sandai was here at this place, and that was why she was laughing. Miki was that kind of a girl.</p>



<p>Suddenly he met eyes with Miki. Miki gave a small wave to him.</p>



 


<p><em>“I’m home.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Nn? Oh, it’s Shino.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Oh god, don&#8217;t go lying around like that, Dad, it’s improper. Hey Mom, say something, too.</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;Just give up.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Geez… I also can hear Miki laughing from above… I’ve told her not to go to sleep until late… Huh? She came down?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Onee-chan, welcome home.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I’m home… wait not that, quickly go to sleep.”</em></p>

<p><em>“Miki was thinking of going to sleep soon, you know?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Then good—by the way, why were you laughing? Were you watching TV?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Miki wasn’t watching TV. It’s nothing. Even so, Miki did think it’s gonna get pretty interesting.”</em></p>



<p><em>“What do you mean? Oh well, I’m gonna go take a bath and quickly go to sleep.”</em></p>



 



<p>He could hear the conversation of a happy family get-together leaking from inside. It seemed somewhat fun, making Sandai feel a little envious.</p>



<p>Sandai&#8217;s parents were away from home due to work. It had been this way since Sandai had been very small.</p>



<p>Although there had been times with them around, he generally wouldn’t see them for half of the year. His parents’ acquaintance would come occasionally to look after him, but scared of unfamiliar adults, he had been keeping a distance without getting any closer.</p>



<p>And when he had been five or six years old when his parents had taken him along to live overseas—he had been helpless, not able to communicate with the language, but at that time as well, his parents hadn’t been by his side, busy with work.</p>



<p>Looking back, he hadn’t been able to learn what an ordinary kid would learn in their home, and this very thing could be said to be the direct cause of why he had become a loner bad at socializing.</p>



<p>Right now Sandai accepted himself, but there also had been a time where he had felt the serious flaw as a human in him, and felt embarrassed of his lack of friends and communication skill.</p>



<p>“Well, I’m just gonna get tired recalling this and that of the bygone past. I’ll have to forget it as much as possible.”</p>



<p>Almost December, the night wind this time of the year was cold, and the whiteness of the breath escaping his mouth was striking.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>The next day, and also the day after that, the same routine passed. And using the time to walk her home, Sandai continued helping Shino study without even wasting a second.</p>



<p>Sandai had a slight feeling about whether she could avoid failing even after coming this far, but he would just have to help her study what he could help her with.</p>



<p>“The scope of mathematics for the finals is focused on differentiation and integration, but we’ll leave out integration. Differentiation is what we’ll do, since you can get the answer with mathematical calculation and all. You don’t have to understand it. Anyway, you can get points if you get used to solving problems.”</p>



<p>“Uwh.”</p>



<p>“For English, we’ll give up on listening. It’s impossible to train your ears now. We’ll focus everything on reading comprehension of long texts. Long texts can easily confuse you with its amount of words, but there’s a lot of cases where the answer is already written in the question. In a sense, English is the easiest. As long as you understand the intention of the question, it’s just whatever.”</p>



<p>“K-Kay.”</p>



<p>“As for other subjects… It’ll mostly be memorization. I guess it’ll be just memorizing using flashcards and vocabulary apps.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>At some point, vigor had disappeared from Shino’s eyes, maybe because of the demanding, high amount of information.</p>



<p>Even Sandai, he didn’t want to see his girlfriend making such a face, but he steeled his heart for the goal of avoiding failing.</p>



<p>Just about everyone doesn’t want to do something that could get them hated. That said, precisely because there is love in it that it could be harsh as well.</p>



<p>Time passed by in a flash, and the day of the finals arrived.</p>



<p>“We will start the finals. Not to reiterate, but cheating of any kind is prohibited. Alright, pass the question and answer sheet to the back.”</p>



<p>As if tossing it, their homeroom teacher Nakaoka placed the bundles of papers on the front row students’ desks, and sat down on the teacher platform’s chair together with a sigh.</p>



<p>Perhaps because in a test there would be no classes, nor anything to do but monitor the students, Nakaoka scratched her back with a back scratcher she had brought from somewhere and yawned.</p>



 



<p><em>“Haaaaahh… the test is already starting.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I kept telling myself to prepare for the finals, but I ended up doing nothing and now here we are.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Everyone, please refrain from whispering!! You’re supposed to take the test quietly!!”</em></p>



<p><em>“You’re the nosiest, Prez. Look, now Nakaoka is awake ’cause you’re so loud. Just let her sleep, man.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Urgh… I’m just saying the right thing, though…”</em></p>



<p><em>“I wanna go home.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I wonder when during the winter holiday the supplementary class starts. I’d hate it if it’s the first day. Christmas Eve will be at that time.”</em></p>



 



<p>While ignoring the murmurs that could be heard coming from all over the classroom, Sandai carried the sheets passed from the seat on the front to Shino on the seat behind him—only to get startled.</p>



<p>As a final push, Sandai had been the most harsh yesterday, but Shino’s eyes had become bloodshot because of that.</p>



<p>“Y-You okay…?”</p>



<p>“Yeah? I’m okay, though?”</p>



<p>As the one who had helped Shino study, Sandai knew better than anyone else that she had been working hard for this day.</p>



<p>He was reflecting that he had gotten a little bit too spartan, however, that had also been to fulfill Shino’s request to avoid failing.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Good luck,” Sandai told her and lightly patted her head.</p>



<p>And then Shino’s ghastly expression softened slightly, seemingly to have regained some of her vigor back.</p>



 



<p class="has-text-align-center">4</p>



 



<p>The sound of writing and the ticking of the clock resounded in the classroom. Without any particular problem cropping up, the test proceeded. Modern Japanese came to an end, English came to an end, and mathematics came to end end.</p>



<p>As for the questions showing up on the test, there also had been many parts which Sandai had taught Shino. With this it seemed like Shino could somehow avoid failing.</p>



<p>While patting himself on the chest in relief, he decided to concentrate on the test as well.</p>



<p>It was a not-at-all-hard test for Sandai who was already done with the scope for high school. Without a doubt he could get almost a perfect score.</p>



<p>However, Sandai was purposefully making some mistakes or leaving it blank. There was a proper reason for this act of deliberately lowering his score.</p>



<p>Sandai had previously overheard a certain conversation between the class president Shihouin and a female student Takasago, but that was the reason.</p>



<p>That had been a conversation about how, if the Prez were to take the first place, his relationship with the timid Takasago could seemingly develop further.</p>



<p>Sandai had been taking the first place in the school year ever since enrollment, but he had the personality who had no intention to hold onto the rank, and wouldn’t mind giving it up if it could help someone’s life go smoothly.</p>



<p>Also because incidentally the failing mark would also go down if the average were to go down, and that could make it easier for Shino.</p>



<p>Well, the failing mark would change because of the average, but the influence of Sandai alone would be very insignificant, so in the end the result would be depending on Shino’s hard work, however…</p>



<p>Anyhow, the two-day finals came to an end just like that.</p>



<p>Sandai turned his head to look back after the answer sheet had been collected—only to find Shino weekly lying face down on her desk.</p>



<p>“The test is over~.”</p>



<p>“It sure is. And so how did it go?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I feel like I did pretty well. By the way, the test questions were all the parts you taught me. I’m a bit surprised.”</p>



<p>“It’s because I kind of know the tendency of the teachers. It’s just, even if I know that, we were on a tricky line where we couldn’t be sure if we had enough time. That’s why I had to considerably cram it into you—at any rate, you’re surprised it was all the part I taught you that came out? That sure sounds like I’m usually saying things randomly.”</p>



<p>“You often do, don’t you?”</p>



<p>“That’s not… no, there are certainly times when I say things randomly. I admit that. That said, only at an okay time even if I do. I’ll get serious when it’s time to get serious.”</p>



<p>“That part about you, I really love it.”</p>



<p>Shino was smiling, seemingly in a good mood at how it had gone for her during the test.</p>



<p>“I don’t know if I can actually avoid failing until the result is out, but I feel like that’s the best I’ve done~.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Come to think of it, why did you want to avoid failing? It’s not like you’ll instantly have to repeat a year after failing, and it’ll end fine if you just take the supplementary class. It’s not like this is an advanced school either where they’ll weed people out with difficult stuff even in the supplementary class,” Sandai asked what he had suddenly thought about.</p>



<p>While yawning, Shino replied, “It’s because the supplementary class starts on the first day of winter holiday. I just don’t like that and wanted to avoid failing, you know?</p>



<p>“You don’t like that the supplementary class starts on the first day of winter holiday? Why?”</p>



<p>“It’s because the first day of winter holiday is the 24th.”</p>



<p>“Ah… So that’s why!”</p>



<p>“You finally noticed?”</p>



<p>Only at this late did Sandai realize the reason behind why Shino wanted to avoid failing.</p>



<p>The 24th would be Christmas Eve. And then they had promised to spend the time with just the two of them on that day.</p>



<p>If she were to take the supplementary class because of failing, that promise would go to the trash can. Shino didn’t like that.</p>



<p>“&#8230;The supplementary class probably will be during the day only, and even supposing that you fail, we can be together from evening until night. I wouldn’t mind that even if it turns out that way, you know?”</p>



<p>“I mind it even if you don’t mind it. Also, since the supplementary class will last for three or four days, it’ll then have an effect on my work shift, too. I’m just gonna cause them all kinds of troubles, aren’t I?”</p>



<p>“You’re surprisingly a serious one, Shino. When you came to my apartment with your little sister Miki-chan too, you got angry so she wouldn’t be a bother to the surroundings, didn’t you?”</p>



<p>“That’s because Miki was just bad.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think Miki had any bad intentions either, though…”</p>



<p>“Are you siding with Miki?”</p>



<p>“I-I don’t mean like that, alright?”</p>



<p>“I’m just joking. Fufu.”</p>



<p>Joking—was what Shino said, but it was a word that was difficult to distinguish whether she was really joking. In this world, there are words that you can take seriously and words that you mustn’t take seriously.</p>



<p>Perhaps because of having a sense of responsibility as an older sister, Shino would often be strict with Miki. And Sandai had known this from seeing it firsthand.</p>



<p>At that time when he had tried to side with Miki previously, he had gotten chided by her.</p>



<p>When taking such a past into account, Sandai had a feeling he better not take the word just now at face value. It was a place where he must not say stuff such as: I see, well I guess she’s your little sister and all, you sure are kind to Miki-chan.</p>



<p>Shino would often speak out her feelings clearly, but nevertheless, it would sometimes become such a situation where she would want him to guess what was in her mind.</p>



<p>Conventionally, Shino would probably be classified as a bothersome girl, but that part of her also looked cute to Sandai.</p>



<p>Well, leaving that aside, the result of the finals would come out in several days, and all that was left to do would be to wait.</p>



<p>Like how Shino languidly completely out of juice, now Sandai wanted to laze around as well. However… there was a looming matter that wouldn’t allow him to also do so.</p>



<p>His first part-time job would start.</p>



<p>But well, Sandai was surprisingly a thick skinned one, and without acting stiffly, he planned to do it indifferently, like letting matters take its course.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>

<p>The first day of his part-time job arrived.</p>



<p>As he was spending his now-back-to-as-usual school life with Shino, just like that, it was now after school.</p>



<p>Finally at last.</p>



<p>“Alright, today’s the day, huh.”</p>



<p>“The day? Ah, I see, your part-time job? Do your best.”</p>



<p>“It’s not like it’s an unreasonable job, and I sure don’t want to work that hard. It’s just cleaning.”</p>



<p>“No feeling like, ‘I’ll do my best!’ at all?”</p>



<p>“Try imagining me saying ‘I’ll do my best!’ with a full face smile and showing my teeth.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Creepy, huh.”</p>



<p>“Right? Well, I’m happy you’re cheering me on, and I’ll try to do my best in my own way.”</p>



<p>“You’re so lax~.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it better to be lax than to weirdly strain yourself? When you see someone overly tense, won’t you worry like, ‘are they okay?’ instead?”</p>



<p>“Hmmm… that might be certainly true.”</p>



<p>“That’s how it is—and isn’t it about time for your part-time job?”</p>



<p>“Ah, you’re right. Okay, see you later then.”</p>



<p>After having the time pointed out by Sandai, Shino hurriedly broke into a run.</p>



<p>After seeing off Shino leaving, Sandai, too, headed to the aquarium, his workplace. His gait was normal, neither light nor heavy.</p>



<p>After walking for some ten-odd minutes, the aquarium came into view.</p>



<p>Perhaps because it was its opening day, even though it was a weekday, it was crowded enough to have a decent line forming which could even be seen from a distance.</p>



<p>“An aquarium is surprisingly getting a lot of visitors, huh.”</p>



<p>Although he had expected it to of course be not empty at all, it was also surprising for him for it to have a line forming, still.</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s a weekday, though.”</p>



<p>In this world, there are a lot of people with a schedule different from school, and there are many more cases of days off on weekdays than Sandai thought.</p>



<p>While looking at the formed line with a sidelong glance, Sandai went inside through the employee room’s entrance in the rear exit—only to find a lot of staff moving around busily.</p>



<p>“That is the entrance for employees, so for a visitor please from the front entrance…”</p>



<p>“I’m Fujiwara Sandai, a cleaning staff. I look forward to working with you.”</p>



<p>“Cleaning staff… I think one came earlier… ah, come to think of it, the cleaning staff was a group of two, was it? The vice director mentioned something like that. Alright then, Fujiwara-kun, the other cleaning staff member has arrived, so go get changed and start working together.”</p>



<p>Apparently they wanted Sandai to immediately get to work, so he clocked in his time card, hurriedly got changed, and began preparing the cleaning equipment.</p>



<p>And there, out of nowhere, Hajime showed up in his cleaning staff work clothes.</p>



<p>“Hey, Fujiwara-kun.”</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s Saeki. Long time no see, huh.”</p>



<p>“It’s not even been a month since we last met, so I personally don’t feel like it’s been that long, though… Didn’t you say something similar before? Maybe your sense of time is bugged?”</p>



<p>“That’s not true. I personally feel it’s been a long time.”</p>



<p>“If I think about it positively, maybe it’s like you were so looking forward to seeing me that every second just felt so long?”</p>



<p>“Nah, it’s because I’ve been a bit busy lately, and things happening a little while ago seemed like a long time ago.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You’ve been busy? Did something happen?”</p>



<p>“I’ve been helping Shino study to prepare for the finals.”</p>



<p>“Shino is… err… ah, Yuizaki-san, right? Yuizaki Shino-san. That reminds me, you did say it before; you said she’s your girlfriend.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s right.”</p>



<p>While having a chit-chat, they went about their work as they had been taught previously in training—picking up the trash outside while the sun was still out, and when that was done, all sorts of cleaning inside next.</p>



<p>“There sure are more visitors coming than I imagined. Even though today’s a weekday and all.”</p>



<p>“Well there are a decent number of people on day off even on a weekday, and then there are probably also many people who want to take a look once since it’s a new opening.”</p>



<p>“Day off on a weekday… huh. Now that you mention it, speaking of jobs with days off on weekdays and setting aside part-time jobs, doesn’t it happen to be unpopular in the case of full-time employees?”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“I saw all kinds of job offers before finding this one, but I saw plenty of job offers for full-time positions that heavily advertised weekends off. As I thought, isn’t that more popular?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Often events and stuff are held on weekends, and the majority of people probably want to actively have fun, so aren&#8217;t days off on weekends popular then?”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“But on the contrary, I think there’s also a lot of people who prefer days off on weekdays, though. Both my papa and mama said having days off on weekdays makes it easier to go to the government office or the bank.”</p>



<p>“Nn? Do you refer to your own parents as papa and mama?”</p>



<p>“Is it weird?”</p>



<p>“How do I say it… I thought it’s like a girl. Well it’s simply just me feeling that way, and I think I’ve told you before, but I’m a loner bad at socializing. There are times I’m out of sync with society. Forgive me for that.”</p>



<p>Hajime was a guy, he himself had said—a guy whose looks, voice, and gestures already looked like nothing but that of a complete girl.</p>



<p>Perhaps the so-called <em>femboy</em>.</p>



<p>No out of place feeling when recognizing one as a girl, but when properly looking at one as a guy, there would be a feeling of discomfort now and then.</p>



<p>It is such a feeling.</p>



<p>“That kind of self-deprecating remark of yours, seems like it would make you enemies somewhat.”</p>



<p>“Make me enemies? Why?”</p>



<p>“I think there’s a lot of people who’d end up thinking you have a bad personality at your ‘I’m a loner bad at socializing’ even though you have a beauty for a girlfriend, you know? I know what kind of a guy you are, so I can easily pass it off, though.”</p>



<p>“I’m—”</p>



<p>“—Just saying the truth since you’re really a loner bad at socializing, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s it. That’s the truth, so I just say it as it is so there’s no misunderstandings.”</p>



<p>“Mm-hmm. But it’s about how the people who’d get that are only people like me who clearly understand you.”</p>



<p>Even if it is a remark that states only the truth, different people would take it differently.</p>



<p>That was a fair point, and one that Sandai should think a bit about.</p>



<p>Sandai didn’t really care about how people he got little to do with would see him like, but on the other hand… Sandai was aware that being like that wasn&#8217;t all right.</p>



<p>So he decided to honestly take Hajime’s point.</p>



<p>“I see… I guess you’re right. Thanks.”</p>



<p>“Thanks?”</p>



<p>“There are times I don’t really get common sense and all that stuff. So, thanks for pointing that out to me.”</p>



<p>At Sandai expressing his thanks while scratching the tip of his nose, Hajime looked surprised and bursted into laughter immediately after.</p>



<p>“Fufu… ahahaha!”</p>



<p>“W-Why’re you laughing, I was just saying my thanks.”</p>



<p>Could it be that… Hajime was making fun of Sandai?</p>



<p>No idea.</p>



<p>However, Hajime was a hard-to-grasp femboy, so what was in Hajime’s mind was impossible for Sandai to know.</p>



<p>While doing all this and that, he reached the end of his first day of part-time job without a single hitch. All that was left would be to clock out and get changed.</p>



<p>When Sandai entered the office together with Hajime, almost at the same time, Komaki in a rubber suit walked in from the other entrance.</p>



<p>“So cold…” With quivering lips, she grabbed the remote for the AC with inconceivable speed and raised the temperature at once. “Quick, quick, get warmer—huh? Fujiwara-kun and Hajime-kun? I see, it’s already time for you to get off work, huh.”</p>



<p>“What’s with that outfit?”</p>



<p>“This? Since today’s the opening day, I thought I’d make the dolphin show a bit longer than planned, so I hurriedly changed the schedule. And then my body got colder than expected. Since you know, it’s a show where I’m also going into the water.”</p>



<p>Apparently she herself had gotten into the water for a show production or something, and that had ended up prolonged.</p>



<p>Komaki seemed to be pushing herself, but since she was the vice director, he felt that it was not a position where she would have to be like that, however…</p>



<p>In the worst case scenario of her physical condition deteriorating, it would have an effect on many things, so shouldn’t her job be to make sure it wouldn’t turn into anything serious?</p>



<p>No, it might be the opposite.</p>



<p>It was also possible that precisely because it was a position with its own weight, she was trying to take the initiative, and show the employees that she was working hard.</p>



<p>“It’s starting to get warmer… but… still cold.”</p>



<p>The room temperature inside the room was steadily rising, but Komaki was rubbing both her hands while shivering, perhaps she was still cold from the inside.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sandai pushed in his time card to clock out, bought a bottle of warm tea from a vending machine installed on the premises, and handed it to Komaki.</p>



<p>“Please take this.”</p>



<p>“Tea? You’re giving me?”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>“Thanks…”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Wouldn’t it be better to not push yourself?”</p>



<p>“I get that, but I’m the vice director. If I don’t show myself pushing myself, I might get told ‘you got the nerve looking so pompous while doing nothing!’ you know?”</p>



<p>Komaki scratched her cheek and smiled wryly. It seemed it was correct that she was deliberately showing herself working hard to the employees precisely because she had her position.</p>



<p>“It seems there is a lot going on.”</p>



<p>“Well, I’m sure the time will come when you’ll understand, too. Yeah.”</p>



<p>“I feel like I will spend the rest of my life without ever understanding it, though… I cannot imagine a future where I’m a person with position.”</p>



<p>“You have a girlfriend, right? You showed me her photo in the training last time, didn’t you? She’s a really cute girl.”</p>



<p>“Err, yes.”</p>



<p>“If you continue to be in a relationship with that girl without any hiccups, you’ll become an adult, and it’s possible it’ll get to marriage and such. Then you’ve gotta work hard and become a big man.”</p>



<p>“Assuming we will get married, I wonder, is there a need for me to be a big man at that time…?”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s fine even if you don’t become a big man, though… For the result of you working hard, it’s an easy to understand indicator, like… hmmm… what I want to say is that, you should show her that you’re working hard I think… I just hate my weak vocabulary. I should&#8217;ve gone to a humanities college instead of the science one.”</p>



<p>Although just somehow, Sandai did understand what Komaki wanted to say. To sum it up, it was about: don’t forget to work hard for your girlfriend.</p>



<p>What suddenly came up in Komaki’s mind, about what a big person was like, was: the results of working hard at your job.</p>



<p>“I understand what you do want to say.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“It’s just somehow, though… I have to pick my girlfriend up after this, so I will take my leave now.”</p>



<p>“Picking her up, huh… I’d love a boyfriend who will come pick me up, too.”</p>



<p>Sandai would like to avoid getting into a long conversation and being late in picking Shino up, so he cut the conversation short.</p>



<p>Then immediately after, having been watching from the side from the beginning, “Fujiwara-kun, you’re rather good at dealing with women, huh?” Hajime spoke so, who knows what kind of a joke it was this time.</p>



<p>“In what way does it look like that? I’m bad with women instead. I can’t even shower compliments like a host in a host club can.”</p>



<p>“Compliments alone don’t mean you’re good at dealing with them, though…”</p>



<p>“I sure don&#8217;t quite get what you’re trying to say.”</p>



<p>“It’s fine, don’t worry about it. Yeah.”</p>



<p>Sandai couldn’t even fathom what the true meaning of Hajime’s words was. That said, Hajime said not to worry about it, so it wasn’t a big deal.</p>



<p>“Speaking of which, we’re still in our work clothes, so we’ve gotta go get changed. Let’s head to the changing room together.”</p>



<p>Hajime’s way of changing the subject was so natural that Sandai almost reflexively nodded his head. However, he remembered that that was a proposal he must not get on board with.</p>



<p>If Sandai were to go get changed together with Hajime, that would mean to end up seeing that body of Hajime. That would end up with discovering something that would never be able to get undoed… was what Sandai felt for the situation.</p>



<p>Sandai had felt the same thing before, but he had gone to change alone in the toilet at that time.</p>



<p>Sandai’s instinct was telling him to do the same this time, too. Deep down inside him was telling him that he must not open the Pandora’s box.</p>



<p>“You suddenly froze up, what’s up? Are you feeling ill?”</p>



<p>“I’m feeling just fine.”</p>



<p>“Then let’s just quickly head to the changing room.”</p>



<p>“No can do.”</p>



<p>“Eh?”</p>



<p>“I’ll go get changed in the toilet.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I get that you’re embarrassed, and I also remember you’re telling me you have that kind of principle, but don’t you think of mustering up the courage a little? And I do feel like we can get to know each other better if we go get changed together.”</p>



<p>“I’m a man who won’t change his principle easily.”</p>



<p>“Wai—”</p>



<p>“—Sorry.”</p>



<p>Sandai grabbed his change of clothes and ran to the toilet without waiting for Hajime’s response.</p>



<p>Hajime wasn’t a bad person, and probably someone who was close to his no. 1 friend. Sandai did recognize that in his heart.</p>



<p>But this and that were a different story.</p>
