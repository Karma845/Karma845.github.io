<h3>Chapter 4:  26 December Time To… Greet Them, Huh?</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>The 26th finally arrived.</p>



<p>According to the plan, Sandai would go to Shino’s home today, but… since today was also the payday of his part-time job, he checked the balance of his bank account first.</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s in.”</p>



<p>The start of his work had been at the start of the month, and the payroll cutoff at the 15th of the month. It was several ten thousand yen, about half a month worth of part-time job earning, but still, an odd sense of accomplishment welled up.</p>



<p>He felt the first money that he had earned from working out of his own wish of wanting to have more fun days with his girlfriend was somewhat special.</p>



<p>With light-hearted steps, Sandai got into the train and got rocked around for about an hour. After that, <em>I think it’s this station</em>, he got off at the station near Shino’s home.</p>



<p>Compared to when he had come here previously, the atmosphere in front of the station seemed just a little different, but that was probably because of the different time of the day.</p>



<p>It is not uncommon for sceneries to feel differently at day and night.</p>



<p>Returning to the topic, Shino’s home was a tofu seller in the shopping district, which was located close by.</p>



<p>When thinking that he really would have to greet them, his restlessness wouldn’t stop. He started to feel nervous.</p>



<p>Humans, in a time when their mind isn’t in its usual, they are one to make mistakes.</p>



<p>Slipping of the tongue, ending up acting suspiciously, and getting into trouble when they realized it.</p>



<p>At a time like this, it is best to take a deep breath and calm your mind.</p>



<p>Sandai bought a sugarless coffee at the vending machine, sat on a chair in front of the station, and slurped it. He reflexively went, “Uwh,” at its bitterness, but his nervousness lessened, and he started to calm down a little.</p>



<p>He casually looked up, and the sky was clear blue. Standing before that vastness, the nervousness he was holding seemed tiny.</p>



<p>It wasn’t a big deal.</p>



<p>He would simply have a talk with them for one or two hours.</p>



<p>Having regained his usual state of mind the next thing he knew, Sandai said, “Guess It’s time to go,” and got up. And he aimed and threw the finished-up, empty coffee can at the trash can for empty cans… and it completely missed and hit the ground, so he picked it up and put it in by hand.</p>



<p>He was seen and got heartily laughed at by a senior lady who happened to pass by, but he decided to not mind it. However, he felt like ignoring it would make him seem like a rude person, so he casually gave a slight bow.</p>



<p>With that happening, he walked for several minutes, and Shino’s home came into sight.</p>



<p>Seeing it once more, it seemed like a fairly old building. It wasn’t the house of someone rich; Shino herself had mentioned it before, so it was whatever to Sandai, though.</p>



<p>For the time being, Sandai thought of getting into the store and calling out. However, the store’s entrance had been shut tight.</p>



<p>In this situation, what would be the best way to notify his visit?</p>



<p>When he had walked Shino home before, Shino had used the key and entered from the store’s entrance. That said, although obvious, Sandai didn’t have the store’s key and the like.</p>



<p>Shout?</p>



<p>Bang bang the entrance?</p>



<p>He thought of those too, but it was rejected as to be expected. It was simply an annoyance to the neighborhood, and it was a crude, without-any-manners way of doing it.</p>



<p>Well, even though it was a store, it was also used as a dwelling, so there should at least be a bell somewhere.</p>



<p>Sandai began the aimless search for the bell, but he couldn’t really find it even after giving his utmost.</p>



<p>There was a postbox beside the store’s entrance, but that was about it.</p>



<p>Wondering what to do, Sandai groaned.</p>



<p>It was then.</p>



<p>From a small path on the side of the store, he could hear the sound of a sliding door being opened. From there Shino appeared.</p>



<p>Apparently there was an entrance for the residence in the back of the building. Sandai also hadn’t looked that far.</p>



<p>“Sandai sure is late… He’s not getting into an accident or something is he? I wonder if he’s okay… Hmm?”</p>



<p>He made eye contact with Shino.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“&#8230;What’re you doing in front of the store?”</p>



<p>“What am I doing? Umm, I&#8217;ve been looking for the bell, you see. I see. So there’s an entrance there.”</p>



<p>“Could it be that you’ve been loitering around in front of the store?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Right.”</p>



<p>“C’mon, you’re like a completely suspicious person.”</p>



<p>“Well, I mean, look, you entered through the store’s entrance, so I thought the store’s entrance is also the front door for sure…”</p>



<p>“The door there’s got a bad fitting and would make a sound, so it’ll echo at night. I’m just using the store’s entrance since it won’t make much sound… Actually, you could’ve just sent me a chat rather than feeling troubled here.”</p>



<p>Sandai’s mouth curved sulkily at the unopposable sound argument. Although Shino sighed at him, she pulled his hand and led him in.</p>



<p>“Geez… you’re making me worried. I thought you’re getting into an accident or something.”</p>



<p>“My bad…”</p>



<p>“If you’re sorry then good… Like I said the day before yesterday, I told everything about you to my mom and dad yesterday.”</p>



<p>“Yesterday… you did say you were having a family dinner. At that time?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. They got a bit surprised, but I also talked about the trip, and I also told them that you’re a boyfriend who would like to properly greet them before that.”</p>



<p>“What was their reaction like…?”</p>



<p>“My mom was like, ‘Sure, why not?’ but my dad got a little, ‘Hmrrg,’ I think? But it was fine!” so Shino said, but Sandai started to feel a little worried.</p>



<p>It seemed there wasn’t a problem with her mother, but the problem lied on her father who had apparently become <em>hmrrg</em>. Sandai had difficulty guessing to what degree the <em>hmrrg </em>that Shino had said was.</p>



<p>Had it been a strong objection or refusal, he felt that Shino wouldn’t have said it so lightly like this, however…</p>



<p>Precisely because it hadn’t turned into a huge issue, it was also possible that she was being light and non-serious about it to not work Sandai up.</p>



<p>Shino unexpectedly got a considerate personality like that, so Sandai felt a bit of an iffy.</p>



<p>However, he didn’t think of saying that he was feeling rather anxious and scurrying back to his apartment at this stage either. He was ready from the beginning.</p>



<p>Shino stopped in front of a sliding door at the corner of the hallway.</p>



<p>Sandai gulped down his saliva.</p>



<p id="jump-1">“Your dad and mom<sup><a href="#note-1">1</a></sup> are… in here?”</p>



<p>“Miki is also there while at it, but… yeah, they are, too. I’ll open it, okay?”</p>



<p>“All right.”</p>



<p>Sandai gave a strong nod, and the sliding door was pulled. Inside was a tatami room, and three people were sitting there in a row.</p>



<p>Sitting on the right side was Miki whom he was familiar with.</p>



<p>Sitting on the left side was a woman around her mid thirties wearing an apron. She should be Shino’s mother.</p>



<p>Sitting in the middle was a man wearing a samue… whose face for some reason all swollen up, but… should be Shino’s father.</p>



<p>It was hard to come up with any distinction in regards to the looks of her father, but in regards to her mother, she was a woman whom everyone for certain would call a beauty.</p>



<p>She had a contour like that of a doll, and a perfectly smooth and straight nose bridge. The eyes in her small face were big, round, and like that of a gem, and the texture of her skin was so fine like white porcelain.</p>



<p>And then, her chest was incredibly big. It was so big that it wouldn’t be weird even if it were to make a boing sound effect.</p>



<p>Shino previously had said something like her chest had gotten big maybe because of tofu, but could it be that the cause wasn’t that but genetics?</p>



<p>No, something like that didn’t matter.</p>



<p>What he must think right now was simply about properly introducing himself.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>Sandai bowed his head for the time being.</p>



<p>“Nice to meet you. I’m Fujiwara Sandai. Umm, I’m Shino’s… no, I’m Yuizaki Shino-san’s boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“So you are her—I’ve heard from Shino. I’m Shino’s father, Daigo.”</p>



<p>It was a really important occasion where the pressure should be heavy as well, but Shino’s father’s—Daigo’s swollen up face made the feeling of tension not there at all.</p>



<p>“Yes. It is my pleasure to meet you.”</p>



<p>“Now, please take a seat there.” Daigo stood up and placed down a floor cushion.</p>



<p>Sandai sat down after saying his thanks, and Shino sat down next to him.</p>



<p>“Umm… it might be sudden, but would it be all right for me to ask a question?” nervously, Sandai decided to ask first about the thing that had been bothering him since earlier.</p>



<p>“Hmm? What is it?”</p>



<p>“Umm… I’m not sure how to say it, but it seems there have been wasps from somewhere, or someone has fallen down… that sort of…”</p>



<p>When Sandai in a roundabout way asked why Daigo’s face was swollen, “Pfft,” the two sitting on Daigo’s sides looked away and laughed.</p>



<p>And then Shino looked at Saigo with a piercing gaze.</p>



<p>It seemed… there was something.</p>



<p>However, it wasn&#8217;t the time and place where Sandai could get the answer to that either, so he kept silent.</p>



<p>“A few things happened, you see. It’s not anything you have to be concerned about.”</p>



<p>Sandai felt such a silent pressure to not ask for the details from Daigo.</p>



<p>For just a little the air became tense.</p>



<p>Immediately after, Shino’s mother got up with a wry smile, poured tea, and placed it in front of Sandai.</p>



<p>“Here you go.”</p>



<p>“Thank you very much.”</p>



<p>“Don’t mention it. That aside, you sure seem like what I heard from Shino, Fujiwara-kun… I believe you already can tell, but I’m Shino’s mom. I’m called Neko<sup>子子</sup>. It’s written with two characters for ‘child<sup>子</sup>,’ Neko<sup>子子</sup>. I do quite like my own name, so feel free to call me Neko, okay?”</p>



<p>It was an easy-to-understand, and then an easy-to-remember name. She was also someone who seemed kind and gentle.</p>



<p>However, he also felt that her personality wouldn’t live up to such a first impression.</p>



<p>From the circumstances of living together, children are strongly susceptible to their parents’ influence—when taking such a common view into consideration, it wouldn’t make sense for Neko to be completely different from both Shino and Miki.</p>



<p>One way or another, he felt that Daigo seemed to resemble Miki, but…</p>



<p>It would be different if they were always away from home like Sandai’s family, but despite being busy, the Yuizaki family had a proper family time. It was hard to think that the influence within family members was small… In other words, it was reasonable to think of Neko to be acting nice.</p>



<p>However, Neko’s personality wasn&#8217;t that important. If she didn’t seem to oppose Sandai’s relationship with Shino, there wouldn’t be any need to know in detail either.</p>



<p>So, instead of such a thing, Sandai was more interested in how Shino had talked about him.</p>



<p>Like what I heard—guessing from these words, it seemed Shino had talked about him honestly, not too much and not too little, but…</p>



<p>“Come on, Daigo-san, don’t get sullen like that. Quickly ask if there’s something you want to ask.”</p>



<p>Told so by Neko, Daigo folded his arms and looked at Sandai once more.</p>



<p>“Well, umm, it seems you want to go on a trip with Shino as a boyfriend and girlfriend, huh?”</p>



<p>Shino had said that she had told them everything. It seemed she had told her parents about everything, literally, about their relationship as well as the trip.</p>



<p>“Yes. I believed it was wrong to go on one as we please, so I thought of making a proper greeting, and then go on one after receiving approval.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“Are we… not allowed to?”</p>



<p>“How about money?”</p>



<p>“I will pay for everything. I do have a part-time job, but the reason I started one in the first place was because I thought money really would be necessary when I would like to create memories with Shino-san.”</p>



<p>“That’s right. Money is necessary for everything… Hmm.”</p>



<p>While giving his chin a stroke, Daigo looked at Sandai with evaluating eyes.</p>



<p>Daigo’s face was in a bad state, but could it be that the reason Sandai was feeling something akin to a mysterious dignity nevertheless was because of a duty as a father?</p>



<p>Though, perhaps the one who was feeling that way was only Sandai, since Miki was chuckling while looking at Daigo, and Neko and Shino looked fed up.</p>



<p>“Hmm… I see, I understand that you are thinking ahead. Hmm… By the way, what kind are your parents?”</p>



<p>Were a daughter’s boyfriend’s parents something to be concerned about as a father? Wasn’t finding out what kind of person the boyfriend was the important one?</p>



<p>However, it wasn’t anything particularly needed to be hidden either. As long as he would like to know, Sandai would honestly answer.</p>



<p>“First of all, my father and mother are not in Japan.”</p>



<p>“Could it be that they&#8217;re foreigners?”</p>



<p>“N-No, both are Japanese. They are overseas for work.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I see. So, what kind of work are they doing? They’re not crime syndicate’s smugglers or anything, are they?”</p>



<p>A jumping-the-gun way of thinking that made Sandai wonder whether Daigo had watched too many movies, but Daigo was Shino’s father. Sandai mustn&#8217;t make such a quip and displease him.</p>



<p>“Both my father and mother are volcanologists. The two of them are doing collaborative research; something of the sort.”</p>



<p>When Sandai mentioned the fact truthfully without any lies, Daigo, Neko, Miki, and then Shino, “Hmm?” squinted.</p>



<p>The one to break the short silence was Daigo.</p>



<p>“Parents are volcanologists and the family name is Fujiwara… By chance, could it be that your father’s full name is Fujiwara Nidai? Does he live in a country named Iceland or something?”</p>



<p>Both the full name as well as place of residence were exactly as what Daigo had said.</p>



<p>However, there shouldn’t be any connection whatsoever between Daigo and Nidai, so how did he know?</p>



<p>“Fujiwara Nidai is certainly my father. Do you know of him?”</p>



<p>“I think it was about a week ago… There was a special program about natural disasters on TV. The name of the so-called volcanologist who appeared there was that. I have also recorded it thinking it could help to prepare in the time of a disaster, but… Hold on a bit… let’s see… yeah, this one.”</p>



<p>Shino’s father used the TV remote, and a light, opening BGM was played, and a documentary-like special program about natural disasters started.</p>



<p>Sandai’s eyes nailed down to the background screen in the program. A middle-aged man in a white robe wearing a black-rimmed glasses was reflected there, but that was without a doubt Sandai’s father.</p>






<p><em>“Global warming is looming. Floods and large droughts constantly occur somewhere in the world. It is also no stranger to Japan that has always been greeted by one since time immemorial. Today we would like to discuss the ‘what if a volcanic eruption were to occur in Japan.’ We have a guest who will be giving any explanations today connected through a video; a volcanologist, Professor Fujiwara Nidai.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Nice to meet you. I’m Fujiwara Nidai. It’s my pleasure to be here.”</em></p>



<p><em>“It is a pleasure to have you here… As Professor Fujiwara currently lives in Iceland, we are transmitting directly through a live video.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I wish I could’ve flown directly to Japan, but given the flight schedules, I didn’t think I would be able to make it, thus this is the way it turned out. I’m sorry for the inconvenience.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Not at all, it is I who should be saying so. Thank you for taking time out of your busy schedule for us.”</em></p>



<p><em>“I hope I can be of any help.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Our guest today is Professor Fujiwara Nidai, a natural sciences graduate of Massachusetts Institute of Technology with its nickname MIT, who went on to the graduate school in the same university where he received his PhD. He has been asked for his input by several heads of state at an international forum last year. Currently, he is said to be the closest person to the Nobel Prize as a Japanese citizen…”</em></p>







<p>To think that his father would appear on the TV screen, Sandai had never imagined it. It somehow didn’t feel real.</p>



<p>“Could this person be… your father, Fujiwara-kun?”</p>



<p>“I would… say so.”</p>



<p>“Is he the kind of person who would get a Nobel Prize?”</p>



<p>“I would say that’s not much of a stretch… I don’t know in detail about my parents’ work, but they probably have put in all kinds of efforts, I think…”</p>



<p>Sandai had never heard any details about their work, neither from Nidai nor Sandai’s mother. He only vaguely knew that they were scholars.</p>



<p>When Sandai averted his eyes, Daigo stood up without saying a thing, beckoned Neko and Miki with his hands, and headed to the hallway.</p>



<p>It seemed the three would be having a family meeting without Shino.</p>


<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>“Did I… say something weird? I didn’t get thought of as an outrageous guy or something, did I?”</p>



<p>When Sandai began talking, Shino started.</p>



<p>“Eh? Ah, about my dad? No, It’s fine.”</p>



<p>“Really?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Dad’s unexpectedly a serious one, so he’s worried about, like, whether you’re a good guy and stuff, but… after actually meeting you, I think he got that you’re not a suspicious guy, and afterwards I think he’s overwhelmed on the contrary after knowing you’re the son of some amazing professor.”</p>



<p>“I-I see.”</p>



<p>“Yeah yeah. Actually, I guess it’s also my first time knowing what kind of work your dad has.”</p>



<p>“Did I never tell you before?”</p>



<p>“I remember giving you advice when you told me you’re troubled with what to reply when getting a message from your dad, but at that time I also didn’t ask what his work was, and I felt like it’s not needed to ask either.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You weren’t that curious about my parents?”</p>



<p>“I was curious, you know? I mean I’m also thinking like actually meeting and greeting them. But, the one I love is you, like, the occupation of your father’s got nothing to do with it, right? …There’s probably also girls who’re interested in that kinda stuff when falling in love with someone, but do you think I’m clever enough to decide my preferences based on something like that?”</p>



<p>“Now that you say that to me…”</p>



<p>“It would be impossible for my brain to handle if I give this and that reason to my feelings of love, so I’m not thinking of unnecessary stuff. Nooope!”</p>



<p>It also sounded like she was being defiant, but that wasn’t the case. Those words were precisely because she simply knew herself well.</p>



<p>He would tend to think about this and that, and at times that would make him seem like a horrible person when looking at Shino.</p>



<p>At times, he would suddenly feel worried, wondering whether someone like him would be okay to be her boyfriend. At times he would also think, wondering if there wasn’t a man more worthy of Shino.</p>



<p>However, Sandai would not speak those out.</p>



<p>The one who had created the spark for them to be dating and the one who had confessed was Shino, but now Sandai also completely loved Shino.</p>



<p>That was why he wouldn’t want to let her go, and was getting rid of the possibility that it might turn that way.</p>



<p>Sandai often acted like a grown up, but in fact, he held troubling inner thoughts different from Shino who would tend to let her feelings run wild.</p>



<p>Sandai was aware of such a troublesome side of himself. However, he pretended to have not noticed it and looked the other way.</p>



<p>If he ended up admitting that, he had a feeling he wouldn’t be able to control himself.</p>



<p>Humans are multifaceted creatures—the words Nakaoka had said before only now did it hit him so deeply. He himself was precisely so.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong? Does your stomach hurt?”</p>



<p>“My stomach doesn’t hurt, but… do I look like that?”</p>



<p>“You do. If I compare it with something… what was it again… look, there’s that bronze statue sitting with its hand on its jaw, right? That one that I feel like I learned in fine arts or something.”</p>



<p>“Is it Rodin’s <em>The Thinker</em>?”</p>



<p>“That! If there’s something in your mind, while at it, try making it look like <em>The Thinker</em> more for a bit.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it too random?”</p>



<p>“Do it.”</p>



<p>“I have to?”</p>



<p>“You have to.”</p>



<p>It seemed he would have to, so reluctantly, Sandai took the same pose as <em>The Thinker</em>.</p>



<p>“Is it like this?”</p>



<p>“I feel like the one I saw in the textbook had its eyes closed.”</p>



<p>Even Sandai didn’t remember that detailedly whether Rodin’s <em>The Thinker</em> had its eyes closed.</p>



<p>Probably the number of people who would remember to that extent was also small.</p>



<p>That said, it wasn’t a place to get worked up and refuse it either, so Sandai obediently closed his eyes.</p>



<p>Immediately after—chu—he got kissed on the lips.</p>



<p>“&#8230;You tricked me, huh?”</p>



<p>Sandai slowly opened his eyes, and found Shino smiling with her tongue stuck out.</p>



<p>“Thinking normally, there’s no way someone like me who doesn’t pay attention to textbooks is gonna remember if it’s eyes closed or not, right?”</p>



<p>That was completely the case, and besides, Sansai had had a hunch that Shino seemed like she would do something like this. He had obediently listened to her on top of that, so in other words, deep down he had been anticipating it.</p>



<p>“Your cheeks kinda red! Were you happy?”</p>



<p>When Sandai gave a brief nod, Shino grinned as if saying she had been waiting for that reaction.</p>



<p>He was resigning himself to being led by the nose in this kind of area, but despite being the first girlfriend and boyfriend of one another, why was there such a difference in the art of coaxing?</p>



<p>It was making Sandai want to sigh.</p>



<p>However, it was no more than the feelings from Sandai’s perspective. If we were to look at Sandai from Shino’s perspective, it would also look differently.</p>



<p>Seizing the initiative with a composed look, casually charming her by doing stuff that would make her heart pitter-patter—when looked from Shino’s perspective, Sandai would also come off as that kind of guy.</p>



<p>To sum it up, it was the so-called: the feelings are mutual.</p>







<p><em>“Just what’s she doing… that Shino. Dad does remember you’re usually saying like ‘I’m not good with guys,’ though?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Miki thinks Onee-chan is still not good with guys, you know? It’s just that Onii-chan is ‘special’.”</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s also my first time seeing Shino being all over a boy so much.”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;”</em></p>



<p><em>“What are you keeping silent for, Daigo-san? Is it about Fujiwara-kun’s dad? I was also surprised, but you also thought ‘she’s got the son of an amazing person as a boyfriend, huh,’ aren’t you?”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;That is.”</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s much better than some weird delinquent introducing and calling himself her ‘boyfriend’ to us. At least I’m relieved. If the type who would go like ‘I’m her BF! Nice–to–meet-cha~’ introduces himself as her boyfriend to us, I’m confident I’d collapse with my mouth foaming bubbles.”</em></p>



<p><em>“The feeling’s the same… but Dad&#8217;s feeling sho lonely. Shino stopped eating tofu, too… Dad’s feeling sho lonely.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Daigo-san, can you stop suddenly talking so grossly?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Dad, it’s all right. Miki’s here even if Onee-chan becomes an adult, you know? That’s why pocket money please.”</em></p>







<p>Now then, not sure what kind of family meeting the Yuizaki family minus Shino had gone through, but the three came back.</p>



<p>“Err… Fujiwara-kun.” Daigo folded his arms, sat down, “Hrm,” and groaned.</p>



<p>Sandai reflexively straightened up his spine.</p>



<p>“I’m going back to the topic. We were talking about you going on a trip with Shino, weren’t we?”</p>



<p>“Y-Yes.”</p>



<p>“Hmmm.”</p>



<p>Daigo stroked his chin once. And then for the second time. And then for the third time—though when he was about to, he got smacked in the head by Neko.</p>



<p>“Oh gosh! I’ve been patient but I’m at my limit! What’s with that attitude towards your daughter’s boyfriend since earlier!? The reply was out since yesterday, so stop pretending and quickly tell Fujiwara-kun!”</p>



<p>“Ouch…”</p>



<p>“What’d you mean ‘ouch’!? The one getting ‘ouch’ is Fujiwara-kun’s heart who’s waiting for the reply that keeps needlessly being drawn out by you—I’m sorry Fujiwara-kun. Sorry that such a man-child old man has to be your girlfriend’s father.”</p>



<p>“N-No, it’s all right…”</p>



<p>“Really geez, this weirdo old man is so…”</p>



<p>Being called a weirdo old man by Neko, Daigo simply and only became smaller without even rebutting.</p>



<p>Apparently, he was needlessly drawing out the answer that was already out.</p>



<p>Perhaps, this was the part where Sandai should get angry, but when he thought that Daigo probably also had all sorts of stuff in his mind as a father, Sandai wasn’t able to say anything.</p>



<p>Instead it was making Sandai want to cover up for him.</p>



<p>“To get called a weirdo old man is… umm, I can imagine for a father to have his mind occupied. Is he not a wonderful dad?”</p>



<p>“Thanks, for putting it like that. Look Daigo-san, you’ve been thoroughly doing something like harassment, and yet Fujiwara-kun called you ‘a wonderful dad’ with a refreshing look there.”</p>



<p>Neko had suddenly turned rough, but Sandai had felt from the start that she had been acting nice, so he wasn’t especially surprised.</p>



<p><em>I knew it</em>, was his honest impression.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, when he saw Neko complaining to her own husband without reservation, he sensed similarity to Shino in some way.</p>



<p>And then, precisely because Sandai sensed that, there was something he somehow understood.</p>



<p><em>Probably… what gets her into a bad mood is probably similar to Shino, isn’t it?</em></p>



<p>Shino would also sometimes come telling Sandai this and that, but even so, there would be a surplus feeling of <em>love</em> clearly being directed.</p>



<p>And Neko was probably similar.</p>



<p>There was an extremely high probability for her personality to be such that she wouldn’t allow anyone but herself to bad-mouth the person she loved.</p>



<p>In that sense, complimenting Daigo was the right choice.</p>



<p>If he were to follow suit with the words <em>weirdo old man</em>, there was a possibility it would’ve turned out horribly.</p>



<p>“Since Daigo-san doesn’t seem he can say it with his own mouth, I’ll say it instead. We are not opposed to your relationship, and for the trip as well; if you go on one with your own money, you can do whatever you like.” Neko continued, “That’s our reply.”</p>



<p>Sandai patted his chest in relief, and seeing that, Shino chuckled.</p>



<p>“I told you it’s fine and you didn’t have to get worried like that, didn’t I?”</p>



<p>“Still even if you say that.”</p>



<p>“Actually, for some time you’ve been like rigid and polite, but if you end up being like that to my parents the first time, I think it’s gonna make you have to continue being like that all the time and just makes you tired, though. I do think being like that’s still fine if it’s with someone you don’t see often, though”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Wait, hold up, that way of putting it, I will be seeing your parents often?”</p>



<p>“You will, don’t you think? I mean, you don’t have to fuss over coming to my house anymore, so when seeing me off you can do it openly all the way to my home, right?”</p>



<p>That was exactly so. Excluding finals period, Sandai had always seen Shino off until the station, but after finishing the greeting today, he could now walk her all the way home without shying away.</p>



<p>Somehow, he had a feeling of having crossed a large mountain.</p>



<p>Even so… Sandai had also thought about it when seeing her off during finals, but to him, the atmosphere of the Yuizaki family looked awfully dazzling.</p>



<p>It wasn’t like Sandai was on bad terms with his parents either, and they would be contacting one another although once in a while. Though, it wasn’t like there was an enjoyable feel to it like the Yuizaki family.</p>



<p>Of course, Sandai also understood that nothing could be helped with that. When thinking of the details of his parents’ work, let alone at home, even frequently not being in Japan was a natural thing.</p>



<p>It would be simple to face and say to his parents that he would like them to treasure their family relationship, but his parents’ work was also related to disasters. If he was told that it was a work that could save people from all over the world, he wouldn’t be able to say it strongly.</p>



<p>Even the game console Sandai had asked his parents to buy with the reason of wanting to have friends as well, now he felt that that might not have been the only reason.</p>



<p>He felt like deep down there had also been the feelings of wanting to be pampered by his parents.</p>



<p>“&#8230;There, there.”</p>



<p>When Sandai hung his head down, Shino reached out to pat his head.</p>



<p>“&#8230;What’s up suddenly?”</p>



<p>“Because somehow you seem like you wanna get pampered.”</p>



<p>At a time like this, “That&#8217;s not true,” Sandai would deny it like so if it was the usual. However, his mental state was currently slightly different.</p>



<p>“Seem wanna get pampered… that’s not… not true either, huh.”</p>



<p>“Eh? …A rare response.”</p>



<p>“Even I become like this sometimes.”</p>



<p>“You become a big baby? Goo-goo ga-ga.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Goo-goo ga-ga.”</p>



<p>“H-Hey~.”</p>



<p>“I’m just joking. It’s just, umm, I don&#8217;t really get what a family is like… I can’t put it into words well, but I’d think, ‘that’s nice,’ when I see your family…” Sandai said with a bitter smile, and Shino opened her big, round eyes wide.</p>



<p>And then, she patted Sandai’s head once again.</p>



<p>“&#8230;There, there.”</p>



<p>Sandai didn’t know what Shino was thinking right now. He would be able to at least come to a guess usually, but only now that that was also impossible for him.</p>



<p>However, the only feeling that got across was kindness.</p>



<p><em>…I’m pathetic, aren’t I</em>.</p>



<p>Sandai had thought that he had been the one supporting.</p>



<p>He could come to an understanding and handle things to a certain extent, he could also do various stuff rather flawlessly, so he had thought that he had been the side to match up with Shino, who had an intense human emotions and a lot she wasn’t good with.</p>



<p>That was why he hadn’t noticed.</p>



<p>That Shino would like to support him, like how he would like to support her.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Have you calmed down?”</p>



<p>Maybe the reason Shino could talk soothingly was because it was something that had developed over the course of looking after her little sister Miki ever since she had been much younger.</p>



<p>Their position was in a complete reversal from the usual, but when seeing it like this, unexpectedly Shino was starting to also seem more of a grown up than Sandai.</p>



<p>Well anyway, a large event of coming to greet her parents ended without any particular problem happening.</p>



<p>The rest would be just to wait for the day of the trip.</p>







<p><em>“What’s with that mood…”</em></p>



<p><em>“Somehow it’s like ‘their own world.’ It’s like being made to eat a mass of sugar, now Miki’s feeling like puking.”</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s like the mood in a drama, isn’t it?”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;It’s a bit off-topic, but as a dad I’d have loved if Shino’s boyfriend was a guy who could complain even if it’s just a little. That way I could get mad at—Owowow, that hurts! Please don’t pull my ear!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Stop trying to meddle with your daughter’s love. Children will eventually leave their parents, so support them instead. Yesterday you also kept saying, ‘No you can’t, no you can’t,’ and then Shino cried and got angry… and what did you get, Daigo-san?”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;I got punched in the face by Shino.”</em></p>



<p><em>“And then so your face bulged up like that.”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;I mean, I felt sho lonely.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Even if our daughters leave us I’m here, aren’t I? Now I’m feeling like punching you, too.”</em></p>
