<h3>Chapter 5:  28 December – 29 December Maybe We’re Finally at the Starting Line, Huh?</h3>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>The day of the trip to a hot spring, Sandai had planned to get out of the bed at 6 in the morning, but it was about 30 minutes later that he actually woke up.</p>



<p>He hadn’t been really able to fall asleep last night, and had finally fallen asleep at 3 am, so that was surely the cause. He knew in his head that he should go to bed earlier than usual, but it being the night before the trip as well, he had been feeling a weird excitement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nothing serious nor problems would come out of this oversleeping since there was time to spare, but he was feeling sleepy because his sleeping time was short.</p>



<p>He would love to go back to sleep, but he wouldn’t be able to stand if he were to oversleep. He should get up proper.</p>



<p>After washing his face and brushing his teeth and such, Sandai wrapped the cashmere muffler he had gotten from Shino around his neck, took the traveling bag he had packed up and got ready yesterday, and headed to the station, their meeting place.</p>



<p>There were quite a number of people at the station. It was the season, so it seemed there were also many people going on a long trip back home for visiting parents and such.</p>



<p>That said it was still early morning, so still on the better side. There would be more people once noon, and the station would likely be jam packed.</p>



<p>He wouldn’t want to go to the station at that time. Crowdedness on the level beyond lively would indeed be mentally exhausting.</p>



<p>“I wonder what to pick…”</p>



<p>To fight his sleepiness, Sandai bought a canned coffee from the vending machine at the station and drank it. After all, caffeine could help, and he simply liked coffee as well.</p>



<p>His companion when taking a break from studying and such would also be coffee.</p>



<p>However, he had also heard that drinking too much coffee would be bad for the stomach. It would be better to not chug it down.</p>



<p>While drinking the coffee little by little, Sandai began gathering info on new light novels on his phone since there wasn’t anything to do either until Shino came.</p>



<p>“For next month… There sure is a lot of new work. I see, it’s the season when award winning work and stuff’s coming out too, huh. There sure are some crazy titles there, too. ‘<em>You, Whom I Met at the Intersection Tomorrow and Yesterday. Just When I Thought You Were a Beautiful Girl Who Liked to Cosplay, You Turned Out to Be an Actual Magical Girl, and Your True Form Was a Middle-Aged Man, so I Cried</em>.’ …There’s an impact in it, but I don’t think I wanna check it out, though.”</p>



<p>He wasn’t sure whether it was the publisher’s joke or a title they had decided with after giving it a serious thought, but as to be expected he would ignore this.</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>A chat message suddenly came in. It was a message from Shino saying:<em> I’m almost there</em>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Sandai returned back to the home screen and waited for Shino to arrive.</p>



<p>A train arrived a few minutes later, and Shino got down from that train. Today Shino was in plain clothes beaming with the desire to go for an outing, so it was a little fresh.</p>



<p>She was wearing a knitted wool hat, boots and black tights emphasizing her slender and long legs, and then on her back was a ladies-pink backpack for travel.</p>



<p>There was a childlike, and unexpectedly grownup feel as well.</p>



<p>“Nya.”</p>



<p>Shino imitated a cat’s paw, and made a morning greeting like a cat. There wasn’t any special meaning to this sort of action of Shino, it was just that, she somehow wanted to do it.</p>



<p>There wouldn’t be any need to think deeply how to react to this, and it would be fine to simply go along.</p>



<p>“Nya.”</p>



<p>“Nya nya nya.”</p>



<p>“Nya nya nya nya. You look cute today, too.”</p>



<p>“Yeah! I gave my best in the matching!”</p>



<p>“Thanks for giving your best. Though, like that your neck’s slightly cold, right? Here,” Sandai said, unwrapped half of the muffler and wrapped it around Shino’s neck.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Shino noticed that this muffler was the Christmas present she had given him.</p>



<p>“This muffler was my Christmas present for you! It makes me so happy you’re actually using it like this… The muffler is snug and warm.”</p>



<p>“After all, it has been warmed up by my neck, My Lord.”</p>



<p>“Hmm, it’s not bad—wait, not My Lord, but Princess!”</p>



<p>“My humble apologies, Princess.”</p>



<p>While holding a conversation mixed in with such playfulness, they moved to the platform where the train heading to their destination would stop on.</p>



<p>They were worrying a little whether to use the bullet train or conventional train. Either would bring them to their destination. However, it was their long-awaited trip, so they purposefully decided to use a conventional train that would stop at every station on the way there so they could sightsee as well.</p>



<p>Of course, they didn’t have the time to get down at every station to sightsee, so they narrowed it down on the ones they were particularly interested in and looked around for about 30 minutes only.</p>



<p>It was brief, but they were unexpectedly able to have fun, still.</p>



<p>Each place had differences. One would be in western style, Japanese style, and so on. It was fun just getting to experience those.</p>



<p>Though, it didn&#8217;t mean that everything differed, as there was only one thing in common in all of the places.</p>



<p>There would always be such local specialties or souvenirs which were unclear whether they were even trying to sell or not.</p>



<p>“They’re selling a weird clay figure-like thing.”</p>



<p>“That’s not a clay figure but a totem pole.”</p>



<p>“Are there people who would buy this?”</p>



<p>“Don’t they put this up because there are?”</p>



<p>“There’s totally none, I’m telling you. Look closely, its made day.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;It says five years ago.”</p>



<p>What did the maker of this totem pole feel when they realized the reality that it was being put up on the storefront without ever getting bought for five years?</p>



<p>Could they feel sad and be choked with tears, or perhaps they didn’t really mind it since it was a business…?</p>



<p>As for Sandai, the one that would’ve given a humane touch had the better impression, so he would be happy if it was the former if possible.</p>



<p>As they were proceeding to the next stations while sightseeing various towns in this way, the townscape that could be seen was gradually becoming emptier as well.</p>

<p>When making a reservation for the hot spring inn, Sandai had aimed for one likely to have availability, but apparently it was so deep in the mountains. He hadn’t checked it out detailedly to that extent.</p>



<p>Even the train, everytime they transferred to another, the railroad cars kept getting shorter and older. Eventually, there were only Sandai and Shino for the passengers in a one-railroad-car train.</p>



<p>Shino didn’t make any complaints in particular. Her home being fairly in the countryside, it seemed she was used to such scenery, too.</p>



<p>The train came out of a long tunnel. Immediately after, the whole surrounding was pure white. It was a snowscape.</p>



<p>“Wow, it’s so crazy white!”</p>



<p>“Kawabata Yasunari wrote a passage that says, ‘The train came out of the long tunnel into the snow country,’ but this sure is a landscape exactly befitting that.”</p>



<p>“Kawabata…?”</p>



<p>“He’s a kind of literary master. Even his name shows up in the modern Japanese textbook.”</p>



<p>“I don’t look at textbooks and stuff…”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>The train began to gradually slow down. It seemed there was a station right after getting out of the tunnel, and the train came to a complete stop before long.</p>



<p>They knew from looking at the station’s name that this was their destination, so they got off. Immediately after, the now completely empty train started moving again as it shook and made creaking sounds against the rail, going even deeper into the mountains.</p>



<p>“We’re here.”</p>



<p>“We sure are.”</p>



<p>When they looked at the sky, the sun was halfway into setting. Faint darkness and silence were also spread out, and it would turn into night in no time at all at this stage.</p>



<p>It wasn’t like they were familiar with the local area, so they decided to go to the inn and check-in without making a side trip.</p>



<p>“Well then, please write down here your name, address, phone number, and signature that would prove who you are.”</p>



<p>Sandai was asked to fill out the hotel register at the reception, so he filled out each empty field one by one and handed it. The sign was Sandai’s full name written in cursive.</p>



<p>Payment for the accommodation would also often be made at the time of check-in, but this time Sandai had secretly paid it through bank transfer, so there was no on-site transaction happening.</p>



<p>“Please enjoy your stay.”</p>



<p>Receiving the inn map in the lobby, Sandai and Shino wandered through the inn, looking for their booked room with the key they had received.</p>



<p>It seemed to be an inn bigger than they had expected as well. There was the main building, an annex, and in addition also something like a special mansion, apparently.</p>



<p>It seemed the special mansion was aimed for guests on the high end, and apparently the rooms all had a private open-air bath. And the fee too, it started from 100,000 yen per night for the lowest.</p>



<p>“The lowest starts from 100,000 yen… I wonder what kind of people would stay in a room like this.”</p>



<p>“Rich people, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“I guess that’s true, but even rich people have all kinds of categories. Probably… I guess you’re really thinking like wanting to try staying at a place like this, Shino?”</p>



<p>“I think the most important thing is not whether you’re able to afford luxuries with however much money, but being with the person you want to be together with, though?”</p>



<p>“I see. I guess you’re right—at any rate, it sure is an inn quieter than expected.”</p>



<p>The presence of people within the inn was few, and they didn’t see many guests staying either. They would pass by other people occasionally, but basically it was ruled by silence.</p>



<p>“I’d hate it to be crowded, so I chose a place that seems to be less crowded, but I guess I really should’ve gone for an inn that’s probably more lively?”</p>



<p>“I mean I’d hate it too if there’s too many people. Well, around this much is just right, isn’t it? I mean it’s a hot spring, so it’s better for it to be quiet than noisy.”</p>



<p>“If it’s a hot spring, a quiet one is better?”</p>



<p>“A hot spring with lots of people will seem, like, already hardly different from a spa &amp; wellness center and the like, right? It’s a hot spring, so what to look forward to is quiet and peaceful, isn’t it?“</p>



<p>“Now that you mentioned it, I guess that’s true, too. Right, the quiet one is calming, so I guess it’s better.”</p>



<p>They arrived at the room they had booked shortly after. The inside was as it had been explained when booking it, a plain, normal-sized traditional room for two.</p>



<p>Sandai had only been able to vaguely imagine how big was normal-sized, but it was smaller than he had thought. The futons already laid out for two people were occupying more than half of it, giving a cramped impression.</p>



<p>“Instead of like because it’s cheaper, I guess I should’ve gone for a bigger room, huh.”</p>



<p>“Then how about we do just that the next time we go on a trip? This time it’s a reward so I had you pay for it, but I’ll pay for my own share next time, so then we can stay in a slightly bigger room.”</p>



<p>“There.” Shino placed her bag in the corner of the room and went to immediately lie down on the futon.</p>



<p>It was still unclear when the next trip would be, but at the very least, to go on one itself was already set in stone in Shino’s mind.</p>



<p>Sandai didn’t say, “I’ll pay for the next one, too.” It was because Shino had the personality that would hate to be on the receiving end only, and saying such a thing would displease her.</p>



<p>This time it was purely under the pretext of a-reward-for-working-hard-on-studying, so Shino was getting herself spoiled by Sandai.</p>



<p>Sandai wasn’t really sure whether such a relationship was a proper couple relationship, though, he didn’t think that this was mistaken.</p>



<p>There are as many what is correct and incorrect as there are people.</p>



<p>For Sandai and Shino, something of this sort was the correct one, so this was correct.</p>



<p>That was how it was.</p>



<p>“Hmm…?”</p>



<p>Shino slowly got up and was staring fixedly outside of the window, apparently having spotted something.</p>



<p>“What’s up?”</p>



<p>“The store over there, I just thought its light was up. Maybe they’re selling anything like souvenirs or something?”</p>



<p>Sandai too looked outside the window. Immediately after, he saw an old-looking general variety store on the old road along the river close by. It seemed to be operating as well since the light was on.</p>



<p>“I feel like we’re gonna see a totem pole or something again, though… Should we try heading there for now?”</p>



<p>“Yeah!”</p>



<p>It was on a location that could be seen from the inn too, and it didn’t seem like they would get lost just because it was now night either, so they decided to head there.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>Cutting it short, there was no totem pole.</p>



<p>Well, umm, it didn’t necessarily mean that there would be one for certain, and it was just Sandai being weird for feeling that they might be selling one, though…</p>



<p>“You said you felt like we’re gonna see a clay-figure, but looks like there’s none, huh?”</p>



<p>“It’s not a clay-figure, but a totem pole, okay… But, well, I guess not everywhere will have one, too.”</p>



<p>Nevertheless, it was a general store with noticeable empty shelves.</p>



<p>Without looking that eager to do business, the granny storekeeper sitting in the attendant’s booth was sleepy-looking, “&#8230;Oh my, is there a customer? Welcome,” and only now noticed the two.</p>



<p>It wasn’t like it didn’t seem to be a hobby of old age or killing time and the like either, so there didn’t seem to be the feeling of trying to work hard too in the first place.</p>



<p>However, even if there was no motivation, Sandai didn’t take it with a bad feeling. He didn’t really dislike such a lax atmosphere.</p>



<p>When you usually live in an urban area, you would frequently see people walking down the street looking busy. And you would also understand that society runs thanks to such people.</p>



<p>Though, somehow it would feel like living in fast paces, and Sandai was slightly not a fan of that. There is a saying—where are you going in such a hurry?—but Sandai’s mind was exactly like that.</p>



<p>And then, for this reason, Sandai valued the leisurely time when together with Shino.</p>



<p>That said… while that may be the case, to say whether he was unsatisfied with the too few goods, it could simply be said that he was.</p>



<p>Apparently Shino was similar to Sandai as she was looking awfully dissatisfied.</p>



<p>At a time like this, Sandai was on the side who would stay silent without saying anything and leave, but Shino wasn’t so and started to talk to the granny.</p>



<p>“Hey Granny, is there anything we can have fun with?”</p>



<p>“Things you can have fun with… I don’t have many things young people can enjoy, though… let’s see… hmm… I do have this, though.”</p>



<p>The granny fished through the cardboard box beside the attendant’s booth and took out a slightly dusty fireworks set.</p>



<p>“We’re past the season too, and I’ve been thinking of throwing it away, so you can go ahead and take this. I’ll also give the match and bucket, so you can go enjoy it on the riverside right there. After you’re done, you can just leave the bucket in front of the store.”</p>



<p>“Granny so kind! Thanks!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s already night too, so I guess it’s time to close up the store.”</p>



<p>People with the ability to take action would often reap the reward, and Shino was unmistakably that kind of person as well.</p>



<p><em>…I sure don’t have this kind of ability to take action. Actually, I thought about it a little, but aren&#8217;t the fireworks and me the same?</em></p>



<p>Sandai’s thought was near the mark, so to say. The course of how it had resulted with him dating Shino, and the course of how Shino had gotten the fireworks from the granny were certainly fairly similar.</p>



<p>To sum it up, Shino had taken action of her own and obtained it.</p>



<p>In that sense, both these fireworks and Sandai were the same.</p>



<p>“I got fireworks~.”</p>



<p>“That’s great, huh… I’m sorry. Thank you so much.”</p>



<p>When Sandai slightly bowed his head, the granny smiled slightly and then began to lock up the store.</p>



<p>The snow was piling up outside, so they headed for the riverside while being careful not to slip or fall.</p>




<p>“&#8230;I guess there are ones that will and won’t light up, huh.”</p>



<p>Given that the fireworks had been covered in dust, it seemed to be considerably old and some would light up and some wouldn’t.</p>



<p>From the way it seemed, it should be about half not being a bust.</p>



<p>“This one lit up when I lit it up, but what kinda firework is this, I wonder?”</p>



<p>“That’s a skyrocket!”</p>



<p>“Eh? Is that so?”</p>



<p>The one Shino had lit up was a skyrocket firework. Seeing the fuse slowly getting shorter, Sandai hurriedly snatched it and placed it on the ground.</p>



<p>They moved away, and immediately after the skyrocket flew straight up then boomed, creating a small petal.</p>



<p>“Oooh.”</p>



<p>“Good grief…”</p>

<p>“It’s small, huh. Even though the one you see like in a festival is much bigger.”</p>



<p>“It’ll be too dangerous and scary if there’s a firework like that in a store-bought fireworks set, though.”</p>



<p>“I see… There’s no similar one anymore, and what’s left is just some sparklers.”</p>



<p>“All right, I guess let’s do the sparklers and head back after that.”</p>



<p>“You’re right.”</p>



<p>They squatted down and lit up the sparklers, and there was a krkrkr sound, and fireballs formed. The fireballs occasionally crackled, making a spark.</p>



<p>Sparklers would immediately burn up. They were continuously going through them, and finally lit up the last remaining sparklers for each one.</p>



<p>Then, Shino suddenly stuck her fireball to Sandai’s fireballs. The now stuck together fireballs expanded like a balloon, becoming just slightly bigger, and then became one.</p>



<p>“It got slightly bigger.”</p>



<p>“Just slightly.”</p>



<p>Speaking of fireworks, it had the image of summer or fall. Sandai had never even imagined that he would play with one in the middle of such a snowy winter landscape.</p>



<p>Though, it wasn’t that bad.</p>



<p>The air was clear even if there was coldness, so instead it looked much prettier even than the fireworks seen in the summer or fall.</p>



<p>“Ah… It dropped.”</p>



<p>The last fireball dropped to the ground. The fireball melted the snow just a little and quickly went out. With this, they had lit up all the fireworks that could still work.</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s done now, so I guess let’s clean up and head back.”</p>



<p>“Okaaay.”</p>



<p>They cleaned up the post-fireworks mess, also left the bucket on the storefront as told by the general store granny, and returned to the inn.</p>



<p>“Uwh, so cold. I’ll enter the hot spring.”</p>



<p>Shino’s cheeks were completely red. She was shivering, apparently enduring the cold.</p>



<p>At this rate, Shino might end up catching a cold. It would be better to quickly enter the hot spring, so immediately after returning to the inn, they decided to return to their room to take a change of clothes.</p>



<p>It was at that time that there was a strange creaking sound echoing inside the inn. The source of the sound was in the direction of the room they were staying in, though…</p>



<p>“What’s that sound, I wonder?”</p>



<p>“Who knows.”</p>



<p>They returned back to their room while tilting their heads in puzzlement, and then, were surprised. Of all things, there was a hole in the ceiling of their room, and the inside was covered in snow.</p>



<p>It seemed the strange sound just now had been from a collapsed accident caused by the weight of the fallen snow, and the one that had taken the brunt was Sandai and Shino’s room.</p>



<p>In front of the disastrous scene before their eyes, all they could do was staring with a straight face.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“&#8230;What to do.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;What to do really, huh.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>

<p>After several minutes passed with them still dumbfounded, someone from the inn finally showed up. It seemed they would like to talk about compensation, apology, and such regarding the sudden accident, so Sandai and Shino decided to go to the inn’s office for the time being.</p>



<p>They were told to wait for a moment when they entered the office, so they obediently waited. And then, without missing a beat, a man claiming to be the inn’s manager showed up. The manager knelt down, and then quickly arched his upper body forward at a perpendicular angle and bowed his head.</p>



<p>“I’m very sorry. I’m very sorry…”</p>



<p>Sandai and Shino looked at each other’s face in front of the manager who was apologizing repeatedly. Then, they showed a dry smile.</p>



<p>The accident was certainly a misfortune.</p>



<p>That was a fact.</p>



<p>However, it wasn’t like they had gotten injured either, so they would try to look past it.</p>



<p>“It just can’t be helped. There’s nothing you can do about a natural disaster.”</p>



<p>“Yep.”</p>



<p>With tears running down, the manager finally raised his face. Somehow, the reaction was slightly exaggerated and seemed strangely like acting, though…</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’m truly sorry. And so, I have thought of having another room prepared, and with it, perhaps I should say as a token our apology, one way or another… Thus with such a thought in mind, we will have a room in the special mansion with a private open-air bath prepared, so please wait for an hour, no, please wait for around thirty minutes.”</p>



<p>It seemed as a token of their apology, they would have a most high-class special mansion’s room prepared.</p>



<p>It was a room that had made Sandai and Shino think about what kind of rich people would be staying at a place like this and such when seeing the reference price on the inn map, but who would have thought that they would be staying there… The world was truly an unpredictable place.</p>



<p>“The open-air bath with 24-hour free-flowing hot-spring water is available for use anytime until the time of check-out. Incidentally… Dear Guests are a young man and woman, thus we will make sure to prepare ‘that’ in the drawer of the desk in the room as well. After all, I believe that it is my mission to ensure our guests are always satisfied.”</p>



<p>What could <em>that</em> possibly be?</p>



<p>Sandai couldn’t really tell, but anyhow, he knew that there was an excessive attentiveness.</p>



<p>When Sandai stared questioningly, wondering why going this far, the manager broke out a cold sweat.</p>



<p>“Umm… I would like to ask for a favor, if possible.”</p>



<p>“A favor…?”</p>



<p>“Umm well, it is regarding this time’s accident, but would you be so kind as to not mention it to anyone else?”</p>



<p>The manager who was behaving excessively modestly, and the very excessive apology; Sandai guessed the reason.</p>



<p>Sandai had forgiven it since it was a natural disaster and it couldn’t be helped, but the reality was probably different, and that it was a man-made disaster as a result of neglecting essentially needed repairs found in inspections.</p>



<p>If this accident were to come to light, it would probably cause an uproar, and then the police would come in order to investigate the reason behind the accident.</p>



<p>Under the Hotel Business Act and such, there should be regulations even regarding safety in various aspects, so it could turn into a criminal case depending on the situation.</p>



<p>The reputation of the inn would probably drop as well, and the one who would bear all of the responsibility at that time would be… this manager.</p>



<p>However, if it didn’t come to light, it meant that they would be able to do repair works in private and make it as if it had never happened.</p>



<p>To sum it up, in order to protect himself, the manager was trying to smoothly talk Sandai and Shino into it with his apology and attitude.</p>



<p>Dirty.</p>



<p>So an adult was a surprisingly dirty creature…</p>



<p>Sandai felt speechless, but he didn’t try to point that out. Shino was delighted, going, “There’s an open-air bath he said!” as she didn’t notice anything, and Sandai would hate to throw cold water on her.</p>



<p>The thirty minutes until the room was ready flew by in a flash, and Sandai and Shino would be guided to their new room.</p>



<p>“And now I will guide you to your room. It will take a slight distance to go to the special mansion, so we will have to walk a little. We have already brought your luggage to the new room.”</p>



<p>Once they moved into the special mansion through a connecting corridor that would make a creaking sound on every step and had tasteful woodblock printings, the atmosphere changed immensely.</p>



<p>There were glass lanterns like artistic candy sculptures that were lighting up in orange color. The wall was in silk damask, and the floor was covered with a silk carpet with coloring that seemed brand new.</p>



<p>“Somehow it’s like a castle or palace or something…”</p>



<p>“S-So this is the place where 100,000 yen per night is the lowest, huh…”</p>



<p>Not used to high-class stuff, Sandai and Shino nervously followed behind their guide. After walking for a while, the guide stopped in front of a certain room.</p>



<p>Apparently this room.</p>



<p>Behind the door made of cypress with an aroma of green leaves, first was the entrance. After that, pulling and going through a sliding door further inside, they finally arrived at the room, which was a spacious traditional room of at least 32 square meters.</p>



<p>“So wide~!”</p>



<p>“It’s already like a house, huh.”</p>



<p>No matter how big of the ulterior motive of wanting Sandai and Shino to be silent regarding the accident, this felt going too far as to be expected.</p>



<p>No, it was excessive precisely because they would want to have it as an excuse, going so far and beyond.</p>



<p>If that was the case, Sandai felt that refusing this room would lead to troublesome things if he were to, so he decided to not mind it.</p>



<p>It would be best to honestly accept it.</p>



<p>“Well then, I will now excuse myself.”</p>



<p>Their guide left, leaving behind Sandai and Shino in the room.</p>



<p>For the time being, Sandai remembered that Shino would like to enter the hot spring and warm herself up, but before he could tell her to get in first…</p>



<p>Shino opened the desk’s drawer with a nonchalant look.</p>



<p>“What’re you doing?”</p>



<p>“Well, he said there’s something inside the drawer, right? I was wondering what it was.”</p>



<p>“He did say that, huh. Is something inside?”</p>



<p>“Wait a sec…”</p>



<p>Shino rummaged through the drawer, “Ah,” and raised a voice, apparently having found <em>that</em> something.</p>



<p>“What did you find?”</p>



<p>“This~.”</p>



<p>The <em>that</em> in Shino’s hand was—condom.</p>



<p>It was a contraceptive.</p>



<p>A young man and woman—was what the manager had said, but in short that had meant, “you’re young so you’re going to go at it, right?” apparently…</p>



<p>Having realized the meaning of the words this late, Sandai’s face blushed. Shino as well, as she was fixedly staring at the condom, her cheeks were dyed in a red tinge, apparently feeling embarrassed at the contraceptive she saw for the first time.</p>



<p>“The ‘that’ that was said earlier is this, right? I wonder what this is, do you? I’m dumb so I don’t know, though.”</p>



<p>“Shi—Shi-Shi-Shi-Shino, st-stop joking around.”</p>



<p>“It’s so slippery that I can tell by touching it over the wrapper. Ooh… so it feels like this.”</p>



<p>Sandai was red in the face and acting strange. And then as if finding that amusing, Shino chuckled.</p>



<p>“Do you know what this is, Sandai?”</p>



<p>“T-That is, you know… umm… well you know, how should I put it…”</p>



<p>“So you know? I see, you’re smart so I guess you’d know.”</p>



<p>“It’s not about being smart, dumb or anything like…”</p>



<p>“I’m dumb and don’t know anything, so I think I’m gonna need to ‘study’ what this is. That’s why… help me study?”</p>



<p>Shino was clearly enjoying it.</p>



<p>Knowing that it was a contraceptive, she was teasing Sandai.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Okay?”</p>



<p>Shino went on all fours, and then approached Sandai slowly, bit by bit. It seemed to… not be a joke either, and that bewildered Sandai, too.</p>



<p>Sandai’s heart was thumping, and the thumping would not stop. One step back, and another, Sandai was backing off as if losing it, but shortly his back hit against the wall, making him unable to back away anymore.</p>



<p>“P—P-P-Please wait.”</p>



<p>“Not gonnya.”</p>



<p>When was the last time Sandai had gotten so faltered? Probably we would have to go back to around the time he had gotten confessed by Shino.</p>



<p>For the first time after so long, he was fully flustered.</p>



<p>Anyhow, irresistibly wanting to run away from this place, Sandai judged that Shino probably really wouldn’t chase him even all the way to the bath, so he ran into the changing room, threw off his clothes, and immediately got to the open-air bath. He hurriedly washed his body and jumped into the bathtub.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>

<p>“Haah… haah…”</p>



<p>While getting his breathing in order, Sandai looked up into the sky and saw a full moon and glittering stars floating in the sky. And before he noticed, snow was also falling like a flicker.</p>



<p><em>That Shino… even if she was teasing me, just now was really going too far. Is something wrong with her?</em></p>



<p>The one with something wrong was Sandai.</p>



<p>Thinking normally, it would be good to head to the inn’s lobby if he would like to run away, and yet he had gone to the open-air bath instead where no one could ever get in the way… he was nothing but a fool who had blocked his own escape path.</p>



<p>Could it be that Sandai was just this dumb?</p>



<p>He was.</p>



<p>Shoop, the sound of the sliding door being pulled open could be heard from behind Sandai, making him freeze up.</p>



<p>Sandai didn’t turn to look.</p>



<p>He could hear the sound of washing up, but he did not at all look back.</p>



<p>However, he was curious no matter what.</p>



<p>So, after the sound of the water was completely gone, Sandai looked back after several seconds had passed, and of course, only to find Shino there.</p>



<p>“An open-air bath~.”</p>



<p>Shino had tied her hair up in a bun and was wrapping her body with a towel. Sandai was relieved that she wasn’t naked, but he kept silent, realizing that the situation hadn’t changed in the slightest.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“What’re you keeping quiet for?”</p>



<p>“W-Well… I’m in here… so I just wondered why you came in…”</p>



<p>“I think it’s not weird at all for a boyfriend and girlfriend to get in together, though?”</p>



<p>Exactly right.</p>



<p>The people who would answer that it is weird for a pair of lovers to get into the bath together if they get asked about it are in the minority. The answer would be very simple: it’s crazy to become a couple of lovers with someone you don’t want to have a bath together with.</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s not weird, but.”</p>



<p>“Then let’s just get in together.”</p>



<p>Shino entered the bathtub while cackling, quickly approached Sandai and went on to sit on his lap.</p>



<p>“W-Why on my lap.”</p>



<p>“Why’re you surprised? We do this all the time in your apartment, right? What’s wrong suddenly?”</p>



<p>Indeed, when spending their alone time in Sandai’s apartment, he would often have Shino on his lap.</p>



<p>However, even though it looked the same, the situation was different.</p>



<p>They would both be wearing clothes in Sandai’s apartment, but currently there was only a single sheet of bath towel that could fall off with just a little tugging blocking direct body contact, and he didn’t think of that as the same as usual.</p>



<p>“No good, something like this is just…”</p>



<p>“It’s fine, you know—I’ve also… come here prepared today.”</p>



<p>Holding hands, kissing, making memories… Sandai had thought that just these had been enough. He had thought it would not be an issue even without going further.</p>



<p>He had even thought that even if a time like a marriage would come someday, it would go on similarly like currently for a while, and getting into a physical relationship wouldn’t be needed.</p>



<p>Of course, it didn’t mean that he had no interest in being connected physically. For this reason that he had porn image, videos, games and such as well.</p>



<p>However, he had a reluctance to actually do such an act.</p>



<p>Since he understood that there was the implication of lust there as well, he might fall into self-loathing, agonizing whether he simply would like to feel good while using the feeling of love as an excuse.</p>



<p>So, he had been trying to not think about it.</p>



<p>He had put a lid on his dirty self, so that he wouldn’t see it if possible.</p>



<p>And yet, Shino was forcibly prying open Sandai’s heart. With her actions, with the mood, she was appealing to Sandai, telling him to show her his dirty part.</p>



<p>Well, umm, it wasn’t certain if that was what Shino was really thinking, though… but in any case, it was certain that Shino was implicitly saying that she would like to be deeply connected in both heart and body.</p>



<p>“I…”</p>



<p>Sandai was trying hard to regain his composure somehow, but a girly smell drifting from Shino’s nape grazed his nose, making him almost lose his reason.</p>



<p>Sandai was even beginning to think that it might not be so bad to lose to his instinct. As if a push from behind, slowly and gently, Shino went to entwine her fingers with his.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’ve never done something like this before, it’s my first time, so I’m trying very hard to get the courage out, you know?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“I wanna feel each other with the person I love, I wanna get ‘closer’&#8230; I wanna get to the next part after a kiss…”</p>



<p>Behind Shino’s roundabout words, it was a declaration of her feelings, that she wanted Sandai to desire it. Just anyone could see such an obvious thing.</p>



<p>On a weighing scale in Sandai’s heart, there was an unpleasant feeling towards himself placed on one side, and the feeling of wanting to fulfill Shino’s wish on another.</p>



<p>Impossible for either to have a completely the same weight, the weighing scale in his heart eventually lurched to one side.</p>



<p>Rapidly, the weighing scale inclined towards the side of wanting to fulfill Shino’s wish. To Sandai, the feelings for Shino weighed more than his own feelings.</p>



<p>“Shino…”</p>



<p>“Yeah… hm.”</p>



<p>Normal kiss, peck, adults kiss, kiss to the nape and collarbone—they continued to express their love with their lips for around ten minutes.</p>



<p>Be it the sound of the hot spring, or the sound of their kiss, it was getting harder and harder to tell one from the other apart. He hugged Shino close at once.</p>



<p>However, right then Shino put her index finger on Sandai’s lips and said, “Wait.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Even if you tell me we can’t, I don’t feel like stopping anymore, all right?”</p>



<p>“I’ll get angry too if you stop here… That’s not what I meant—let’s do it in the room. Let’s continue in the room, okay?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You wanted to get to the next part after a kiss, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah… please be gentle… Today you know, I brought the lingerie present you gave me, so I’ll put it on.”</p>



<p>After getting out of the open-air bath, Shino put on the Christmas present lingerie Sandai had given her and went to lie down facing upward on the futon. Still in that posture, she reached out her hand and pulled out a book out of her opened backpack.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Wanna try this, too?”</p>



<p>It was the book Shino had said she would rather study about, and had bought when they had been tailing the class president under the request from Takasago. It was: <em>20 Ways to Kiss to Deepen Your Love</em>.</p>



<p>Sandai felt like now they weren’t at the stage where that kind of study would be needed either, but even so, as long as Shino would like to try it, he would simply do exactly that.</p>



<p>Having opened the book and laid it down on the side, Sandai hung over and hugged Shino close. After that, one by one, he went to try the kisses written on the book.</p>



<p>Each time their feelings gradually became aroused, a mysterious feeling as if climbing the stairs of adulthood one step at a time came attacking.</p>



<p>Their long breath intermingled with one another, and now it wasn’t even clear whose breath it was anymore.</p>



<p>And then, right at the time where it should finally be the time for them to become one—Sandai noticed Shino’s strangeness.</p>



<p>Shino’s eyes were wet and filled with anticipation. However, deep inside, Sandai sensed a small amount of anxiousness and fear mixed in as well.</p>



<p>Get the courage out—that was what Shino had said earlier on Sandai’s lap. What that meant was that, all of the inviting behavior had been a show of courage.</p>



<p>To have a physical relationship for the first time, in a sense different from Sandai, was something Shino could also do nothing about but feel scared and anxious.</p>



<p>That was why she had been teasing Sandai excessively much more than usual. By doing so, she had been desperately containing her shaky resolve.</p>



<p>However, Sandai wasn’t able to stop too at this point. That said, there was only one thing that he didn’t forget; to make an effort to not make Shino anxious, to not make Shino feel scared as much as possible.</p>



<p>Sandai grasped Shino’s hand, put it around his own back, and said, “&#8230;Go scratch and hurt my back with your nails.”</p>



<p>“Eh…?”</p>



<p>“If you do that, even your anxiousness, scared feelings and stuff should lessen up a bit. Probably.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think I’m anxious, scared or… whatever… though…”</p>



<p>“If you endure it, it’ll only turn into a bitter first experience, a memory you don’t really want to remember, or something like that. I want it to be the first time that both of us can think to be the best, enough that we want to recall it again and again. That’s why, scratch my back with all you’ve got enough to leave marks, and let out of your feelings, the scaredness, anxiousness, all of it without bottling it up.”</p>



<p>After hearing Sandai’s whisper close to her ears, perhaps the strain of her nervousness had been loosened up, Shino tightly closed her eyes and nodded repeatedly as small drops of tears floated up from the corners of her eyes.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Sorry. I wanted to become a lewd girl and make you happy, but as I thought, the first time is scary and makes me anxious.”</p>



<p>“No need to apologize. But, that part about you is really cute, too—I love you, Shino.”</p>



<p>“I love you too, Sandai… I love you a lot… I love you so much…”</p>



<p>Precisely because the heart and body are closely related that treasuring one side over the other would end up giving birth to one-sidedness, which could also lead to a distorted relationship.</p>



<p>Only when you become one with both that you can be lovers in the true sense of the word for the first time. Lay bare each other’s innocence, accept each other, and it would be the beginning from there.</p>



<p>So, it could be said that Sandai and Shino too finally stood on the starting line.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>


<p>As if it wasn’t enough, his back that had gotten scratched by Shino was stinging in pain and also strangely felt like burning. It was now slightly better, but there had also been the sensation of blood oozing until just a short while ago.</p>



<p>Curious as to how his own back had turned out, Sandai checked it on the mirror—only to get startled at the so many scratch marks.</p>



<p>There was also a considerable number of scratches so deep it would definitely leave marks.</p>



<p>“Y-You’re the one who told me scratch! You told me enough to leave marks!”</p>



<p>“It’s not like I’m angry. It’s just, every time you see my back, it might make you think back that you’re the one who did it, but are you all right about that?”</p>



<p>“It could also look like a marking that this back is mine, so I’ll be satisfied every time I see it instead.”</p>



<p>“I-I see. Then that&#8217;s good.”</p>



<p>“Actually, the one who bled wasn’t just you, but me too. So we’re even~.”</p>



<p>The blood that she emphasized she had also bled was one due to the breaking of hymen.</p>



<p>It hadn’t gotten noticed at the beginning, but midway. And not to mention Sandai, Shino had also been dumbfounded.</p>



<p>Sandai had known that blood could come out. Precisely why he had tried to be gentle in his own way even while enduring the pain from Shino scratching his back.</p>



<p>Even so, blood had come out, so Sandai had gotten surprised.</p>



<p>Shino too had gone, “Eh? Eh?” confused, and seemingly had gotten into extreme panic, she had suddenly hugged Sandai close and gone to scratch his back more strongly.</p>



<p>Ninety percent of the wounds deep enough to leave marks had been from this time.</p>



<p>“At any rate, the fact that blood came out… was it painful, too? I tried to be gentle, though.”</p>



<p>“It did feel weird, but… it’s not like it was painful, that’s why when I saw it I got really so surprised.”</p>



<p>Sandai was relieved. It might make for an unpleasant memory for Shino had it been painful, so he was happy that he could avoid that.</p>



<p>“I heard there’s also a lot of people who wouldn’t bleed even on their first time, and if it’s a lot, I wondered if I’d be like that too, though…”</p>

<p>“So there are people who wouldn’t bleed, huh.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I heard there are a lot of them… Actually, you know what? This is so funny.”</p>



<p>While lying down on the futon, Shino pinched the used and bulged up condom and laughed.</p>



<p>“So full like a balloon~.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I-It just can’t be helped, all right? I mean, I just had sex with the girlfriend I love for the first time. Spare me at least on that.”</p>



<p>“Fufu. It’s like a diluted Calpis, somehow looking like a drink, isn’t it? …Maybe I should give it lick?”</p>



<p>“I-Idiot.”</p>



<p>Shino was saying weird things, so Sandai snatched the condom, tied it up so the inside would get out, and threw it into the trash can.</p>



<p>“Ah…”</p>



<p>“No licking it!”</p>



<p>“But I’m curious, like, I wonder how it tastes, like that.”</p>



<p>Sandai let Shino eat a light flick on the forehead, making her go, “Auwh,” and shut her eyes.</p>



<p>“Don’t say any weird things.”</p>



<p>“No need to get into a bad mood like that… I’ve let myself get spoiled by you and kept scratching your back, but after the sex and I’ve calmed down, to tell you the truth, I did feel slightly sorry. But, seeing the used condom, I understood like, ‘Ah, so Sandai’s fully satisfied, too!’ and so after that, I’ve come to see the inside as cute, too.”</p>



<p>Shino was certainly saying weird things, but it appeared to be purely words coming from her true feelings, making it hard too for Sandai to complain.</p>



<p>However, even though it was hard to say, Sandai thought that drinking it, licking it, and such really was weird, so he would like to tell Shino off, although in a mild manner—though, before he could, he noticed Shino was already sleeping peacefully.</p>



<p>It seemed Shino was quite tired.</p>



<p>Their first sex had ended without a problem, the excessive nervousness had come undone, and then there was the sense of relief as well. Adding all that up, Shino was exhausted.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Good night,” Sandai said and kissed Shino on the forehead.</p>



<p>Immediately after, although Shino was still asleep and hadn’t woken up, there was a smirk on her face and drool spilling from the corner of her mouth.</p>



<p>“Fuhehe… fuheh…”</p>



<p>“Look at you, making a funny face… Wait hold up… funny face?”</p>



<p>Suddenly, <em>come to think of it, I still haven’t given her my payback for taking a photo of my face kissing the train’s window before</em>, Sandai remembered.</p>



<p>Since right now was the perfect chance for it, Sandai took a photo of Shino’s drooling face with his phone.</p>



<p><em>Let’s show this to her sometime on the way back</em>.</p>



<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>


<p>The night came to an end. Sandai and Shino leisurely woke up around after seven, got ready to head home, and after that they went to have breakfast.</p>



<p>After getting to the hallway, Sandai immediately noticed that Shino seemed a little weird. Shino wasn’t walking straight but staggeringly.</p>



<p>“Oof…”</p>



<p>“What&#8217;s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Well, umm, around under my stomach still feels weird, a little…”</p>



<p>Body part wise, without a doubt, the weird feeling was caused by the sex last night. Of course the one mainly responsible for it was Sandai, and the one in question was also aware of it.</p>



<p>Then, although not meant as making up for it either, Sandai decided to give Shino a piggy back. “Get on,” Sandai told Shino. Then she staggeringly went to climb his back.</p>



<p>“Thankies.”</p>



<p>“I’m also partly to blame here.”</p>



<p>“Not partly but all of it, isn’t it? Who was the one who thrusted, I wonder?”</p>



<p>“You sure can look at it that way too, huh.”</p>



<p>“I think there’s no other way of looking at it, though.”</p>



<p>And then, after finishing their breakfast, they decided to take a look at the inn’s kiosk since there was still a bit of time left until their check-out.</p>



<p>It wasn’t like there was something they would especially like to get, as it was simply to buy souvenirs to bring to their workplace. It was a casual gesture, but the piling up of such a small thing would shape people’s impression and appreciation.</p>



<p>“I wonder what to get… Is something like confections good?”</p>



<p>“You’re right. Something like confections might be good. Even if we buy and give stuff like straps, it sure could trouble the one getting it if it doesn’t suit their taste.”</p>



<p>“I see. If it’s confections, if the one getting it knows someone like within their friends or family who might like it, they could just give it away even if they don’t really like it?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, yeah.”</p>



<p>While discussing it between themselves, they bought mizu manju and castella. They were bothered by the slightly high price, but well, it was the so-called location price, and adding to it also was something akin to ambiance price.</p>



<p>Technically, it was similar to food stalls at the festival and the like. Added value is there to be abused.</p>



<p>No, putting something like that to the side, since it was now the time anyway, they decided to check out and head home.</p>



<p>Then, the manager came out flying from inside the inn to hurry after them as they were leaving and said, “P-Please wait! Umm… I wasn’t sure if it would be good to bring it up again, but when I thought about the unlikely chance that my request had been forgotten, my mind simply cannot… Therefore, regarding the accident yesterday, I beg of you…”</p>



<p>Why were the living things called adults so desperate to protect themselves like this? Nakaoka as well who Sandai had seen in a bunny suit before, later on she had also desperately tried to have him keep quiet about it.</p>



<p>For the time being, “Did something happen yesterday?” Sandai said so, indirectly conveying that he would forget the matter. The manager patted his chest in relief.</p>



<p>Now then, afterwards.</p>



<p>Having arrived at the station nearest to the inn, they decided to use the bullet train on their way back instead of the conventional train that would take time as they had done their trip sightseeing yesterday.</p>



<p>And the fare cost money, making Sandai’s part-time job earning gone too with this, but even so, he prioritized not getting tired.</p>



<p>The bullet train really was fast. It came out of the tunnel in a flash whereas it had felt so long on a conventional train. The snowscape too ended immediately.</p>



<p>“The trip&#8217;s done just like that~. I had so much fun!”</p>



<p>“You’re right. By the way…”</p>



<p>Sandai took out his phone from his pocket and showed Shino the photo of her drooling sleeping face.</p>



<p>It was the picture taken last night.</p>



<p>“T-This is… when did you…”</p>



<p>“I took it when you’re asleep,” Sandai said nonchalantly.</p>



<p>Shino peevedly pouted her mouth, and then immediately jumped to try to snatch away his phone.</p>



<p>“Delete that!”</p>



<p>“W-Whoa whoa…”</p>



<p>“I don’t sleep with my face like that!”</p>



<p>“Nah, you’re sleeping with a face like this that’s why I’m saving it as a photo, though…”</p>
