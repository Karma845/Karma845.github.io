<h3>Chapter 5 – A Loner Won’t Even Remember the School Festival, Isn’t It?</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>The calendar had turned to November, but Sandai’s everyday remained the same.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It went like this: still not able to find a good pick despite actively looking for a part-time job while attracting attention at school.</p>



<p>Speaking of something that could be called a change… Shino had started making lunch for him, and it should be just about that.</p>



<p>Sandai would now eat lunch together with Shino after they had completely stopped hiding their relationship, but this had led to Shino making lunch for him now.</p>



<p>Seeing the teacher going outside after the bell signaling the end of morning classes echoed, Sandai yawned and turned around to find his girlfriend sitting behind him fishing through her bag and pulling out two flashily decorated lunch boxes.</p>



<p>“It’s lunchtime~.”</p>



<p>“Lunchtime it is.”</p>



<p>When he opened the lid of the lunch box wondering what today’s lunch would be, a crazy big pink-colored heart appeared.</p>



<p>“I tried making a heart out of pink fish floss~.”</p>



<p>“Ooh!”</p>



<p>“So I was making it with that, trying to express my feelings, and actually the heart is almost sticking out… ‘Cause my ‘love’ is too big to completely fit in something like a container.”</p>



<p>“I’ll take it all in even if it’s sticking out.”</p>



<p>Although their sense was slightly numb, it was an exchange not at all embarrassing for those two. But it was only the case for the two of them, so the surrounding classmates who were being shown that turned bright red in the face and were hanging their heads down in unison.</p>



<p>And they, boys and girls of the age liking to gossip, went quiet now that those two were actually flirting in front of them.</p>



<p><em>“Don’t just say nothing, someone go stop them. My heart is being destroyed.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Your heart can just go broken for all I care.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Still, those two, they’re really unbelievable, huh.”</em></p>



<p><em>“So Yuizaki-san’s good at cooking. I didn’t know.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Uh-huh.”</em></p>



<p>To begin with, Shino was good at cooking and confectionery making, so there was absolutely no shortcoming in the taste of the lunch she made.</p>



<p>However, Shino was not at all satisfied with the status quo as she had been eyeing Sandai’s nonchalant reactions during meals and fine-tuning everyday.</p>



<p>Shino should know that Sandai was a man who wouldn’t make any complaint even if it was unsavory, but she wouldn’t get spoiled by that and allow any compromise.</p>



<p>Sandai didn’t say that it would be fine for her not to try so hard; after all, it would do no good to throw cold water on the person in question’s enthusiasm, and she would probably find a way to cut corners just right in her own way before long.</p>



<p>Besides, Sandai believed such words like ‘it’s better like this and like that,’ if going too far, would simply be imposing one&#8217;s own sense of values.</p>



<p>Sandai knew full well of such a very important thing that everyone would tend to overlook: ‘don’t do to others what you don’t want done to you.’</p>



<p>As a result of being a loner who had continued to keep his distance from others, he was able to see parts that would be too close to see.</p>



<p>A loner is status that tends to be taken negatively in general, but it is curious that it also has such a charm the regular people wouldn’t have.</p>



<p>Perhaps, that could be ‘The Fox and the Grapes.’</p>



<p>Many people feel that they don’t know how to deal with a loner, that they don’t know what a loner is thinking, but not getting closer ends up making it like a discrimination, so they decide that ‘a loner is a no-good existence’ and secure the justification to stay away.</p>



<p>It is an awful thing, but on the flip side, it is also a special fruit that only those who have approached unafraid, only those who have given their best to extend their hands—for example, only a girl like Shino—will be able to obtain it.</p>



<p>The person in question didn’t seem to be aware, however…</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>



<p>Although the same for any school, the number of lessons in the afternoon were fewer than the one in the morning, and it was the same for the school Sandai and Shino were attending.</p>



<p>After lunch, the after school would come soon.</p>



<p>And so, with today’s school life over, they left the classroom together. However, suddenly, a male student with glasses and hair parted to one side stood in the way with his arms wide open.</p>



<p>This male student should be the class president. It was a face that even Sandai got a recollection of at least.</p>



<p>“Hold your horses.”</p>



<p>Neither Sandai nor Shino could remember having done anything to earn a warning, so they quickly went to walk past the class president like nothing happened.</p>



<p>And then, “I’m saying hold your horses!” The class president once again stood in their way, exhibiting an attitude of not letting them through at any cost. Just what could he possibly want? Sandai sighed, and Shino shrugged her shoulders.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Just what do you want?”</p>



<p>“We’ve got no business with you, Prez.”</p>



<p>“I know you guys have no business with me. That’s not what I meant, I have business with you guys. …I have heard of your relationship. You two are dating, right? Love birds, right? I’m not going to ask such a thing like ‘How in the world could that happen even though there doesn’t seem to be a point of contact anywhere?’ because privacy should be protected, and I’m not trying to get in your way either. No, I mean, look around you!.”</p>



<p>When they looked around as told, it was brimming with lots of students making sign boards and decorations.</p>



<p>“You get it, don’t you!? It’s the school festival! Don’t try not participating at all! We’ve got only a week left here!”</p>



<p>It was certainly the time for the school festival. School events were alien for Sandai, so he had completely forgotten it.</p>



<p>As a side note, not only Sandai who had the school festival slipped from his mind, but apparently Shino as well, and her eyes were swimming around.</p>



<p>“I-I was so busy with my part-time job that I didn’t have the time to participate, and so like, that’s why I forgot it? Isn’t it pointless to remember every single event you might not participate in? I mean, I’ve also got work today.”</p>



<p>“I’m basically a gloomy loner… In other words, asocial? So because it’s like that, from the start I was seeing the school festival as an event to ignore. Not remembering it gotta be the so-called act of God.”</p>



<p>“Yuizaki-kun’s reason is still okay, but concerning you, Fujiwara-kun, just where in the world would you find an asocial loner who makes a beautiful girl as his girlfrie… No, I’d just let that sink in. I understand you guys have your reasons. But however, nevertheless, I want you to participate to the extent you can. You guys probably don’t even know what our class’ program is seeing the two of you are like this, but we have decided to run a cafe.”</p>



<p>The class president kneeled on the floor and fluidly prostrated himself.</p>



<p>It was such a beautiful motion that one might be convinced that it was a part of some kind of a religious ritual, and it even got a strange sublimeness to it.</p>



<p>“It’s not compulsory, and I know it’s sudden for you guys, so it’s fine for you to leave for today. …The preparations for the school festival would go on smoothly even if we’re short about two people, but it’s not going to make such a memory of how we’ve all worked hard together, right? As the class president, I want to make sure that it will remain in everyone’s memories by having everyone participate. It is a once-a-year event in our only three years of high school life. You might be thinking that we have one last time left next year since we are in our second year, but that is wrong. …It will turn hectic because of the college entrance exam next year, and there will be people putting on the final push as well. That’s why this year is essentially the last school festival where it is possible for everyone to participate.”</p>



<p>Sandai and Shino looked at each other. They were trying to just somehow avoid this, but with such passionate feelings demonstrated head-on in a prostrating position, they would completely be the bad guys if they ignored it.</p>



<p>“I’m begging you! I’m begging youuu…!!”</p>



<p>Being shouted at by the class president as if it was the last push, they folded up; they nodded, hanging down their heads.</p>



<p>“Oooh… My ardent passion must have reached you!”</p>



<p>Seemingly overcome with emotion, the class president stood up and tried to hug Sandai while crying.</p>



<p>The next moment—</p>



<p>Shino instantly narrowed her eyes, and landed a front kick to the rushing class president’s stomach. Perhaps hitting a bad spot, the class president fell to his knees and bent forward.</p>



<p>“O-Oww…”</p>



<p>“Don’t go trying to hug someone’s boyfriend. I won’t allow it even if it’s a man.”</p>



<p>“I-I was just so happy, so…”</p>



<p>“I say don’t. If you try it again, I’ll trample you on the most important part of a man.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I-I understand. It’s my bad. I won’t do it again. S-So please don’t say scary things like that. Your eyes are looking serious there, Yuizaki-kun. You should joke in modera—</p>



<p>“—I’m being serious, though? No way I’m joking around.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>The class president went silent, overpowered by Shino’s matter-of-factly remark.</p>



<p>The reason Shino’s anger had manifested in a violent direction should probably be because of the class president’s action that would involve Sandai, and because she was bad with men, making it two unreserved bullseyes, but… Sandai felt like he had ended up seeing a staggering side of her.</p>



<p>“He said it’s fine for us to leave today, so c’mon let’s go. Let’s ask around if anyone wants help with the school festival tomorrow. I’ve got work off tomorrow, so it’s also just right for me. …Wait, you’re making a weird face there, what’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“It-It’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.”</p>



<p>“You’re weird. What’s wrong, really?”</p>



<p>Since Sandai, no matter what, couldn&#8217;t say that he got scared, he decided to dodge it .</p>



<p>“Y-&#8230; You called me weird, but to begin with I’ve always just been weird since I’m going out with you, Shino. At any rate, I started thinking only about you, and that’s my top priority, just anyone will agree to that that I’m a man who’s becoming weird.”</p>



<p>He felt it was slightly too blatant, but thanks to also mixing in what he truly thought, Shino genuinely took it without even noticing. Her cheeks turned vermillion, and she suddenly looked away.</p>



<p>“It’s not weird thinking about your girlfriend… That’s just obvious.”</p>



<p>“Is that so…? Wait, why you’re not saying it while looking over here? Are you getting bashful?”</p>



<p>“I’m not bashful or anything.”</p>



<p>“Then why you’re not turning your face over here?”</p>



<p>“It’s nothing really. Don’t worry about it really.”</p>



<p>When Shino looked at Sandai with only her reproachful eyes moving, she immediately returned her gaze back.</p>



<p>Suddenly a wind came in through the window.</p>



<p>The wind blew through Shino’s hair, and the tip of her fluttering hair tickled Sandai’s nose.</p>



<p>“Aa… achooo!” He sneezed, and a snot also oozed out along with it. “Crap… You’ve got anything to wipe with?” Sandai asked, and Shino took out a handkerchief from her bag.</p>



<p>“&#8230;You&#8217;re just so hopeless,” she said and began to gently wipe Sandai’s upper-lip.</p>



<p>“I-I can do it myself.”</p>



<p>“It’s fine, it’s fine. …You’re just like a baby, with a snot. A big baby. Fufu.”</p>



<p>Feeling a kind of never-before-felt embarrassment from being treated on the same level as an infant, Sandai got bright red up to his ears, only for Shino to smile seemingly amused by that.</p>



<p>Seeing that innocent smile of hers, Sandai felt sorry for having felt fear for Shino a moment ago. When Shino had let the class president eat her front kick, she had merely been in a battle ready state, and her natural state in normal times was this one.</p>



<p>There was not even a need to be afraid.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>



<p>The next day, the two of them went around asking their classmates if they needed help. However, the responses weren&#8217;t really good.</p>



<p>‘Eh?’ Help? Nah, I’m on schedule so it’s fine… I mean even if it gets hectic, I don’t want to be working while breathing in sweet air, so I’ll refuse… go to hell.’&nbsp;</p>



<p>That was what a male student told the two, and from a female student—</p>



<p>‘By help… you mean you two together? I can only see that as you picking a fight with me who’s never got a boyfriend for as long as I’ve been alive, though?’</p>



<p>Such words came out and were thrown at the two.</p>



<p>They just seemed to be awfully hostile, but… well, the act of showing off one’s intimacy is something that is generally frowned upon.</p>



<p>But it didn’t mean everyone was showing such a response, as Shino’s gyaru friends clapped their hands and welcomed them.</p>



<p>Though, Shino was asked to appear with them as a waitress wearing a slightly risqué outfit together at the event day as a member to attract customers, which of course Shino refused. Shino clearly refused it in dislike, saying, “Not a chance will I ever show myself in risqué outfit to anyone except my boyfriend,” and making an X with both arms.</p>



<p>The refused gyarus didn’t get dispirited. Given that they knew of Shino’s personality, it seemed from the start they’d thought of just giving it a shot and nothing more.</p>



<p>“Haah… it’s a no, huh.”</p>



<p>“I’ve told you we can only give up if she used her BF as a reason.”</p>



<p>“Yep right. Shinopyon just lives in a different world from the likes of us who got no boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“I want a boyfriend~.”</p>



<p>“I get you.”</p>



<p>The gyarus stuck out their tongues and waved their hands, then left to go see the outfit.</p>



<p>Although he didn’t know just what kind of outfit they got in store, it would probably be the kind with lots of exposure given that it would be risqué. As to be expected, as Shino’s boyfriend Sandai simply would hate for her to be dressed in such an outfit being seen by other men, so he sighed in relief at the fact that she’d refused it.</p>



<p>Then Shino smiled, reassuring him.</p>



<p>“&#8230;C’mon, you don’t have to worry. I’m not inconsiderate like that after all. I might tease you, but I won’t think of trying to make you jealous. You’d totally hate things to get shaky from doing something like that, right? Well?”</p>



<p>Unlike Sandai who might make the wrong decisions occasionally regarding actions related to people’s feelings, Shino drew the correct answer truly without hesitation.</p>



<p>Incidentally, she was also good at giving a warning; indirectly saying, ‘Don’t do anything unnecessary like trying to make me jealous.’ She seemed to be wary around this area, perhaps because he got the previous offense of ending up worrying her.</p>



<p>Such words like ‘That was inevitable’ or ‘How long are you gonna be holding a grudge?’ would have the opposite effect, so Sandai nodded without saying anything.</p>



<p>Shino narrowed her eyes and stared fixedly at Sandai’s profile.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Wh-What?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Nothing really.”</p>



<p>It felt like she was suspecting him whether he really understood or not. Since getting weirdly shaken would only stir up suspicion, Sandai deliberately pretended to be oblivious and changed the subject.</p>



<p>“But still, there sure are nothing but people who said they don’t need help.”</p>



<p>They had already asked around so much, but got shot down everywhere, and the only one showing willingness to accept them so far was Shino’s friends, but she’d refused that as well.</p>



<p>At this rate, they might not even be able to say ‘We’ve participated in the school festival preparations.’</p>



<p>“I think there are still some classmates we haven’t asked, but… looks like we’re gonna get similar results, huh.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Well, it won’t hurt to ask, and if it’s a no then so be it.”</p>



<p>When they sat down together on the stairs at the back of the gymnasium, caww caww, the cawing of a crow resounded. They both hung their heads down feebly.</p>



<p>Suddenly a shadow of a person fell upon them. When Sandai looked up, it was the class president.</p>



<p>“&#8230;So it’s you, Prez.”</p>



<p>“Fufufu… It has reached my ears about you guys going around asking people if there’s anything you can help with! I’m extremely delighted as you seem willing to participate.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;We got refused from everywhere, though.”</p>



<p>“That’s just how it’s going to be if you show off yourself flirting around. Just everyone will get pissed.”</p>



<p>“Rather than flirting, we’re just going about as usual, though.”</p>



<p>“Yup.”</p>



<p>“You’re completely not aware, huh…”</p>



<p>“We’re not even aware of it, that’s why it’s as usual… Nah, this talk seems like just gonna go around in circles. Anyway, since everyone says they don’t need any help, we can&#8217;t help but not be able to join the school festival, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s not the case. I have good news.” The class president snorted, and pointed at a certain corner of the school building.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Over there was the room for cooking class, however…</p>



<p>“Looks like there’s a girl practicing to make the food for the cafe, but she seems to be troubled as it’s not going well. By all means, go help that girl out. The girl’s got the personality that won’t give you guys the cold shoulder, so rest assured. …You’re good at cooking aren’t you, Yuizaki-kun? Seeing that you’re even making boxed lunches where looking at it makes me feel embarrassed and all. I’m counting on you. Well then, I have things to do as a class president,” the class president said and then went off somewhere with a rough huff.</p>



<p>How to put this, maybe it could be said that he was surprisingly very caring… He seemed to have guessed the situation on their side and found a place they could help with.</p>



<p>In the sense of ‘the rare chance of not having to help out in any way was destroyed,’ it was nothing but uncalled-for, but saying that wouldn’t do any good either. Heave-ho, Sandai and Shino stood up and headed for the cooking-class room.</p>



<p>There was a single girl in the cooking-class room.</p>



<p>That bob-haired, like-a-small-animal small-built girl was silently stretching a dough with a rolling pin.</p>



<p>It was a face Sandai had never seen before.</p>



<p>When Sandai tilted his head wondering whether there had ever been such a girl among his classmates, Shino gave an answer. “&#8230;It’s Takasago-chan.”</p>



<p>“You know her?”</p>



<p>“I won’t remember a man’s name unless I’m super interested in them, but I will remember a girl’s name. That girl is Takasago Mahiro-chan.”</p>



<p>“Let alone someone of the same school year, I don’t even know my classmates well to begin with, be it guys or girls.”</p>



<p>Sandai remembered only to the extent of students who were standing out like the class president or Shino and his homeroom teacher Nakaoka, and no more than that.</p>



<p>It was because he thought that knowing someone with whom he would never get involved with anyway would just be a wasted use of brain capacity.</p>



<p>“&#8230;That’s so like you, Sandai.”</p>



<p>When Shino chuckled, Takasago suddenly noticed them and turned to look. “Umm… errr… Yuizaki-san and Fujiwara-kun…?” Immediately after asking and jolting up, Takasago went, “Awa awa,” and moved to the corner of the room and curled up. Apparently timid just like how she looked.</p>



<p>“You don’t have to get that scared… We’ve been asking around trying to offer help with the school festival preparations, but we got refused everywhere we went, you see. Then when we wondered what to do, Prez led us here,” Sandai explained the situation while scratching his head.</p>



<p>And then Takasago responded to the ‘Prez’ part. “Prez… Shihouin-kun did…?”</p>



<p>“Shihou… in? Eh?” Sandai couldn’t help but glance to the side. He hadn’t expected the class president to have such a cool, high-class sounding surname. “Somehow… what an amazing surname he’s got, huh? That Prez.”</p>



<p>“I mean, I also didn’t know Prez’s username, though… Sounds like a rich kid.”</p>



<p>As Sandai and Shino were talking in whispers, Takasago came closer albeit nervously, perhaps a little less tense now after having seen them like that.</p>



<p>“U-Umm… err… so you came here to help… a-at Shihouin-kun’s order?”</p>



<p>“Order? Oh well, it wouldn’t be good to argue semantics. Well, that’s right.”</p>



<p>“Well, something like that.”</p>



<p>“Thank you so much. Then this is sudden, but I’d like you to see what I’ve made. I think I made this one up nicely.”</p>



<p>Takasago bowed her head repeatedly, and immediately brought a plate of cookies, but they were of an incredible color.</p>



<p>They were seven-colored.</p>



<p>“Umm… what an amazing… color, huh.” Sandai swallowed down his saliva at the sight of the cookies in color he had never seen before, and Shino picked one up and stared at it intently.</p>



<p>“I-It’s cool in a sense… and there are also sweets like this, but… how do I say it, it feels different from those…”</p>



<p>Contrary to her round-about way of speaking, Shino was awfully grim. She’d like to defend Takasago’s own hard work, but… she was at a loss for words, so to say.</p>



<p>That said, although those were awfully disquieting cookies, it would also be possible for the impression and the reality to be different.</p>



<p>“We-Well, look, it’s common for foreign sweets and the like to be colorful… and this might be in that vein… right?”</p>



<p>“Th-That’s certainly possible, but… this is… n-no, yeah, you’ll never know unless you try it, isn’t it?” Shino said and put the cookie into her mouth.</p>



<p>In the next moment—</p>



<p>Shino broke out into a puddle of unpleasant sweat all over her face, “Ueeh,” spat out the cookie and then immediately collapsed.</p>



<p>Sandai was startled and rushed over to her.</p>



<p>“H-Hey!”</p>



<p>“I-I’m sorry! I’m terrible at cooking and making sweets! It might not have tasted good… and I didn’t taste test it, too…”</p>



<p>“This is totally not on the level of being terrible at it, it not being good, or not taste testing it…”</p>



<p>While glancing at Takasago with a horrified look in his eyes, Sandai wiped Shino’s mouth which still got some vomit on it and rubbed her back.</p>



<p>Although Shino was out cold for some time, she somehow managed to regain consciousness with Sandai fervent, continuous nursing.</p>



<p>“Uwh…”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You feeling good? Should we go to the infirmary?”</p>



<p>“It’s okay… I mean, these cookies are crazy.”</p>



<p>“By crazy… How crazy?”</p>



<p>“If you eat it… you’ll know.”</p>



<p>It is true that experiencing it would be quicker, but Sandai had seen Shino immediately spitting it out and collapsing, so to be honest, he wouldn’t want to eat it.</p>



<p>However, it was also the truth that there would be no other way besides that to truly understand just how dangerous these cookies were.</p>



<p>After some contemplation, Sandai held Shino’s hand, nodded, and extended his hand for a cookie.</p>



<p>“U-Umm… I think it’s better for you not to…” Takasago anxiously looked at him and gave a warning, but not planning to back down anymore, Sandai readied himself and tossed it into his mouth—only to feel a bizarre stimulation.</p>



<p>A pain like being stabbed with a pin or something ran through his sinus, he involuntarily cried, then next his tongue went numb, and the back of his ears suddenly heated up.</p>



<p>Poison.</p>



<p>Unmistakably a poison.</p>



<p>Sandai collapsed while foaming bubbles.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>



<p>“I thought I was gonna die…”</p>



<p>“See? It was crazy, right? Feels like it could turn into a big problem in a bad way if you serve this.”</p>



<p>“Rather than it could, it absolutely will.”</p>



<p>Having regained consciousness, Sandai borrowed Shino’s shoulders and got up while staggering, and Takasago repeatedly lowered her head.</p>



<p>“I truly don’t know how I should apologize for this… O-Other people in the cooking group could do it right, but I’m the only one who’s like this, that’s why then I’m practicing alone… and Shihouin-kun did encourage me to keep trying, but… like, Shiouin-kun also collapsed and… but…”</p>



<p>Apparently the class president had eaten the cookie, and then judged that this wasn’t at the level where self-help could do anything, and then brought this up to them.</p>



<p>The class president had requested Shino for this, but well, he got an eye for people. Including confectionery making, she was good at cooking as a whole, and her personality wasn’t bad either, so she would certainly be cut out for helping the timid Takasago.</p>



<p>Shino herself seemed to catch on to her role and patted Takasago’s shoulder, pom-pom.</p>



<p>“Eh? Umm, err…”</p>



<p>“I might not seem like it, but I’m good at confectionery making, so I’ll be sure to teach you how!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Are you sure? Even if you know that all I can make is poison-like sweets that will knock you out if you eat it, are you still going to teach me?”</p>



<p>“It’s turning poisonous must absolutely be because of a series of weird mistakes, so we just need to fix the mistakes one by one, don’t you think? It’s gonna be OK.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Th-Thank you so much.”</p>



<p>“Well then, now try making it again from the beginning.”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>Takasago wiped away her overflowing tears, placed a bag of wheat flour on the desk… and then took out a small tube from her pocket.</p>



<p>He thought it might be some kind of flavoring or condiment, but on a closer look, the packaging was different. That strangely familiar-looking thing was the paint used in art classes.</p>



<p>He got a bad feeling.</p>



<p>“&#8230;What is that?” Shino asked with her cheeks twitching—</p>



<p>“It&#8217;s paint, you know? I mean, this is needed to add colors to sweets, isn’t it?” Only for Takasago to give a carefree smile as if that was absolutely normal.</p>



<p>Frightening.</p>



<p>Of course, Sandai who was listening from the side, and as well as Shino who was being told that directly to her face, were taken aback with their cheeks twitching.</p>



<p>“Y-You don’t need it, you know? You don’t use something like paint.”</p>



<p>“Eh? But to add colors…”</p>



<p>“We add colors with something different. There’s one used for sweets.”</p>



<p>“Is that so? Then we need this, right? Sa*poru.”</p>



<p>“That’s… a toilet cleaning agent.”</p>



<p>“That’s true, but it would be a disaster if some germs get mixed in and cause food poisoning, so I thought it would be best to use something with enough sterilizing power to clean a toilet.”</p>



<p>“It’s very dangerous so don’t do it.”</p>



<p>“Is… that so?”</p>



<p>“It’ll be okay if you wash your hands properly beforehand, and you’re going to bake it in the first place, so it’ll be totally safe there. …By the way, what did you plan to add after the paint?”</p>



<p>“After that is… err… it’s been getting colder lately, so I thought of using something like the content of a hand warmer so that it would keep the body warm. So I divided them into small bags like this and brought them with me…”</p>



<p>Takasago seemed to be taking it seriously in her own way, but ignorance is a cruel thing, making her go in all the wrong directions for what she thought would be the right thing to do.</p>



<p><em>…Well, I also can’t go that far in making fun of people, though.</em></p>



<p>Naturally, Sandai wasn’t as bad as Takasago, but nevertheless, he was an amateur all the same and he himself fully knew that. There was the possibility of ending up somewhere like Takasago if he opened his mouth.</p>



<p>Thus, <em>You go girl</em>, Sandai cheered for Shino in his mind and stealthily migrated to the corner with a nonchalant look.</p>



<p>At a time like this, it would be best to observe quietly.</p>



<p>Despite being stung by Shino’s gaze who seemed to want to say something, Sandai turned his face away and pretended he hadn’t seen it.</p>



<p>“Geez…”</p>



<p>Seemingly also understanding that her own lover would be of no help, Shino let out a deep sigh and began to teach Takasago all by herself.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><source>5</source></p>


<p>Sandai was gazing out the window—the sun was gradually sinking, the sky became deep orange, the dead leaves of trees planted on the school grounds danced in the wind.</p>



<p>It was the very essence of tranquility.</p>



<p>Ah, today too has come to an end, as I gaze far beyond the clouds where the fall breeze blows—someone once wrote such a poem.</p>



<p>Indeed, it was Fujiwara No Sadaie.</p>



<p>The conversation between Shino and Takasago and the sound of confectionery making could mysteriously be heard vividly. However, a short time later, that ceased.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I think we managed to make a decent one. Hey Sandai, don’t just go looking like a melancholic poet like that, here give this a try.”</p>


<img src="https://icantreadjapanese.files.wordpress.com/2022/07/9rb3nza.jpg" alt="9rb3nza" border="0"></a>


<p>They had made normal-looking macarons, apparently the confectionery making guidance had gone off all right. But even though it looked normal, his instincts might reject it, as Sandai’s body had remembered the toxic-substance like taste from earlier.</p>



<p>That being said… he couldn’t run away from this one, and besides, he could tell it wouldn’t end terribly from looking at Shino’s reassured expression.</p>



<p>Sandai resolved himself and threw a macaron into his mouth. And then a taste of a moderate, just right sweetness spread out.</p>



<p>“&#8230;This is good,” Sandai spoke.</p>



<p>With a smile, Shino shrugged her shoulders and turned to look at Takasago. “See? If you just follow the recipe, there’ll be no problem.”</p>



<p>“Y-Yes! To think that I can make sweets that could be eaten, I’m moved! Moreover at the level where it would be okay to charge money for it…!”</p>



<p>“I think you’re just exaggerating, though… In any case, don’t go making strange alterations from thinking like it might be better this way or that, okay?”</p>



<p>“Yes!”</p>



<p>While ignoring Shino and Takasago’s exchange, Sandai glanced at the clock to check the time.</p>



<p>It was almost six.</p>



<p>Looking around, the school was also practically becoming devoid of people.</p>



<p>Especially staying behind any further than this without any particular reason, they might get scolded by the patrolling teacher.</p>



<p>“It’s already getting dark, so let’s head home.”</p>



<p>“It’s already this late…? You’re right, then let’s head home. Takasago-chan, see you later.”</p>



<p>Having quickly left the cooking-class room along with Shino, Sandai casually looked back, and then noticed Takasago hanging her head down with blushing cheeks.</p>



<p>At first he thought that maybe she was feeling sick, but that didn&#8217;t seem to be the case.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I did my best, so I wonder if Shihouin-kun will praise me. …N-No, but, but, I’m sure there must be other girls who think he’s cool. He’s so cool with how he’s always giving his utmost, so I’m sure I’m not the only one who notices that, right?” muttered Takasago.</p>



<p>It appeared that Takasago was harboring some kind of a special feeling for the class president, but well, from her standpoint, it wasn’t an impossible-to-understand feeling. Despite her making poison-like sweets, the class president had encouraged her without abandoning her, and even sent help on top of it.</p>



<p>That kindness that wouldn’t forget to be considerate, from the standpoint of a girl like Takasago, would be seen as a great charm that could make up for the shortcoming of a quirky personality.</p>



<p>And then, having sensed such a bittersweet atmosphere of love, Sandai at the same time fell into an indescribable, odd feeling.</p>



<p>Perhaps, it could even be said that he got affected by it.</p>



<p>“Hmm? Sandai, what’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Well… it’s like, somehow I want to kiss you now, Shino.”</p>



<p>Hearing Sandai honestly expressing his current feeling, Shino grinned and came to a stop.</p>



<p>“I see, so you want to, huh. Then sure, here you go,” she said, crossed her hands behind her back, and closed her eyes.</p>



<p>The cute girlfriend he was proud of apparently would, and generously as well, accept his desire, so Sandai would love to take action, immediately right this instant… or so how it was, but he would have to do something first.</p>



<p>Checking the perimeter.</p>



<p>Although there were few signs of people, this was still at school.</p>



<p>Everyone and their dog already knew that they were dating, but however, he was nervous about kissing at school.</p>



<p>Eating lunch together and clinging close like glue would be no more than expressing ‘intimacy,’ so it would still fall in the category of a wholesome relationship.</p>



<p>However, to kiss is not an act that would give off the feeling of ‘intimacy,’ but that of a ‘man and woman.’</p>



<p>Something like a kiss was something they would regularly do and was nothing more than a confirmation of love, and in the first place, it is something just about every adult does, for example.</p>



<p>That said, neither Sandai nor Shino was an adult, and at the same time neither were they a child—a place called school was where one would be faced by that reality.</p>



<p>By no means are there only people supportive of how those with the unripe title of a student are going into romance. In other words, he couldn’t even guess what would happen if someone with uptight public morals were to witness them in a kissing scene.</p>



<p>If it was at their home or outside, they could just play dumb that it was an accidental resemblance; it would work out one way or another. However, they wouldn’t be able to make an excuse if they were spotted at school.</p>



<p>Sandai restlessly checked the surroundings. No eye-catching figure of a person could be seen but Takasago a short distance away. That being said, Takasago was heading towards the entrance with an unsteady gait without even looking over here; she didn’t seem she would turn around either.</p>



<p>Sandai patted his chest in relief, and pressed his lips against Shino’s in the hallway illuminated by the flickering fluorescent lights.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Nnh.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Nh.”</p>



<p>Sandai’s face spontaneously heated up from the tension he was holding and the strange sense of guilty pleasure coming a beat late.</p>



<p>It was then—</p>



<p>Sandai heard the sound of footsteps suddenly getting closer from somewhere and got startled.</p>



<p>Someone was coming.</p>



<p>Shino didn’t seem to have heard it, but given that it was around the time where breathing would become hard, Shino pulled her lips back albeit slowly, which was a godsend.</p>



<p>“Your heart… is beating so hard, Sandai. Even though we’ve kissed countless times… but I do understand the feelings. Because when we kiss, actually my heart is always pounding too, and deep inside my body will get so hot that I feel like it might break.”</p>



<p>Although Sandai was brimming with the feeling of joy at how cute his girlfriend was, right now wasn’t the time to be saying such a thing.</p>



<p>The kiss was over for now, so he grabbed Shino’s shoulders in order to get out of that place. “Shi… Shino!” Sandai’s expression was ghastly; he was that serious.</p>



<p>But that backfired and gave Shino a strange misunderstanding. “What now~? Wanna do it again? …Sure,” Shino said in an excited, shrill tone, and then without even waiting for Sandai’s next words, wrapped her hands around his neck and quickly pulled him closer and kissed again.</p>



<p>…<em>It’s no use. We’re screwed.</em></p>



<p>Sandai felt happy at the feel of her soft lips applied with a lip balm of his favorite fragrance, but at the same time he was filled with despair at what would unfold.</p>



<p>However, the so-called small mercy occured. The one showing up, the owner of the footsteps, was his homeroom teacher Nakaoka.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Hrmm.”</p>



<p>Holding a flashlight with a ‘Patrolling’ plate hanging around her neck, Nakaoka was fixedly staring at them kissing.</p>



<p>Perhaps because of her tolerance towards students’ youth… rather, perhaps also because Nakaoka was the perpetrator who had incited Sandai at the very beginning, she seemed to have read the mood perfectly instead without even getting angry nor surprised.</p>



<p>She retreated back without making a noise and quietly disappeared.</p>



<p><em>That was a close one… thank god</em>.</p>



<p>They somehow managed to weather through, but it was just luck this time. Had it been a teacher other than Nakaoka, it would have undoubtedly led to problems. He should be careful from now on.</p>



<p>“&#8230;?”</p>



<p>Shino finally noticed that Sandai got a relieved expression on his face, but she tilted her neck looking puzzled.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>


<p>Although there had been hair-raising events of collapsing due to poison-like sweets and being seen kissing, they had managed to get involved with the school festival at any rate.</p>



<p>When sandai reported the matter to the class president the next day, “Very well,” the class president nodded contentedly. And then apparently they could just give a little behind-the-scenes help on the day of the event. “Do tell Yuizaki-kun that I appreciate her efforts.”</p>



<p>“She’s just right there since we’re all in the same class, so go tell her yourself.”</p>



<p>“U-Uhuh. That’s as you said, but I just can’t deal with Yuizaki-kun, you see… Since I got kicked, I’m actually kind of scared of her.”</p>



<p>The class president was apparently beginning to feel not able to handle Shino, but that being the case, because exactly this reason to want to talk alone with Sandai was a bad move.</p>



<p>That kick was fueled by her jealousy in addition to the circumstance of her not being good with men, and hence Shino had reminded the class president to stay away from Sandai.</p>



<p>And yet, when it came to creating a situation like this one now, he could tell from looking at Shino’s face as she was sitting in her own seat; it was beginning to look unbelievably scary.</p>



<p>As it seemed like it would turn ugly, Sandai decided to cut it here.</p>



<p>“Prez… see you later.”</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah.”</p>



<p>On the way back to Shino, Sandai passed by Takasago. He looked back on reflex, and saw Takasago talking to the class president.</p>



<p><em>“Shihouin-kun, umm, I can now make sweets from being taught by Yuizaki-san! I also tried to make it after I got home yesterday, and here it is, but would you like to taste it…? I-It’s all right! It doesn’t taste weird anymore!”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;Looks like the colors are normal now. The taste seems like it’ll be fine either. All right. …Oooh! These are sweets with a normal taste here!! It’s not poison anymore!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Poison… So you really did think that way, Shihouin-kun.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Eh? No, you’re wrong! I-I wanted to say it now lacks originality, and I was just kind of lacking for words! It is originality that lacks flaws! Me of all people, though… That’s rude of me, my apologies.”</em></p>



<p>That really sounded like a forced excuse, but Takasago didn&#8217;t seem particularly unhappy about it; she gave the feeling of, ‘it’s fun to be able to chat with the one I like.’</p>



<p><em>“Speaking of which… There will be end of term tests after the school festival is over, and I’ll be cheering for you, so please do your best, Shihouin-kun!”</em></p>



<p><em>“Yeah. My goal is first place in the school year. …However, there is a strange thing nevertheless. I usually put all my energy into studying and also go to a preparatory school and cram school to a certain extent. That’s why I can get a high score, but not even once have I been able to get first place. It&#8217;s the second. …I’m curious about who is in the first place, but under the name of protecting personal information or whatnot, our ranks will only be told to each of us. …I intend to take first place next time for sure.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Yes! I-I will celebrate it if you get first place!”</em></p>



<p><em>“N-No, you don’t really have to… you should think about your end, Takasago…”</em></p>



<p>Not knowing at all about the class president eyeing for first place, Sandai, having been secretly and always maintaining first place, idly scratched his head.</p>



<p>To think that his own grades would play a role in the development of a man-woman relationship of a pair…</p>



<p><em>I think I’ll cut corners a bit in the next end term test</em>, Sandai began to think such. Not that he was fixated on the first place, but he had simply found himself always being in the first place from having been studying to pass all the time he’d got in the world during his long-term loner period before meeting Shino.</p>



<p>He neither got emotional attachment nor obsession with rankings.</p>



<p><em>I wonder how many points I should drop. Well, if Prez is second place, I think the margin is slim, but… five points… nah, I guess I can drop ten points to get a safe margin</em>.</p>



<p>While Sandai sat on his seat while ruminating about it, poke poke, Shino poked his shoulder with her finger.</p>



<p>“Nn? What’s up?”</p>



<p>“I just thought you’re making a serious face for some reason.”</p>



<p>“Ah well, I just caught up in thinking about the end term test.”</p>



<p>“End term… test?” Shino suddenly turned to look serious.</p>



<p>“What’s with that face?”</p>



<p>“I-I’m fine. Just some test is no big deal. I’ve managed to get by till now anyway.” Shino was putting up a bluff that was somehow giving him a bad feeling. Since Sandai could not simply pretend not to see, he decided to just send a helping hand indirectly.</p>



<p>“Well you know, I don’t want to brag, but I’m the type who’s good at studying. You can count on me when push comes to shove, alright? You can think of it as me wanting to show my good side.”</p>



<p>Shino pouted and hung her head down. “&#8230;Thanks.”</p>



<p>“I’ve got no clue what you’re talking about. That aside, Prez said he appreciated your effort.”</p>



<p>“I don’t wanna talk about Prez.”</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>
