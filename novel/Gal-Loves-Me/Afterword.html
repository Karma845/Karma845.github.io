<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p>In the story, Sandai-kun and Shino-chan met each other by coincidence, and there was also no special circumstances or reasons leading up to them dating either.</p>



<p>The two people who had no contact with each other came in contact through a minor thing, became a boyfriend and girlfriend from carried away by momentum and mood typical of high school students, Each and every word, each and every action little action rocked their hearts, but it was a serious and whole-hearted realistic youth and romance—this is work born out of a wish to write, as freely as possible, about such ‘things happening at the period where one is neither an adult nor a child’ while also taking into account the fun, development, setting, and characters typical of light novels.</p>



<p>I wonder if everyone of the readers will be able to accept it, given the unique atmosphere of the entire work including various characters… Anxiously, I would love to visit bookstores and specialty stores sometime around the release date to thank, in person, those who have picked up the book, but I’m a shy one, so I don&#8217;t think I will be able to do such a bold move.</p>



<p>That is why I would like to take this opportunity to express my deepest thanks.</p>



<p>Thank you to each and every one of you who picked it up! It would be my pleasure if you feel that the work is well worth the price.</p>






<p>By the way.</p>



<p>This work is also a work that has been published into a book after winning a prize at Kakuyomu, but there were changes and additions to the writing and development when it was being published, and I endeavored to be able to satisfy those who have been reading the work since it was on the web as well.</p>



<p>The work started right after the start to get the book published in earnest, and while I wanted to make it as complete as possible, I also had a deadline to meet… Nevertheless, there is no way I could spend more than a decade structuring, writing, and revising it the way Hugo did when he wrote Les Misérables.</p>



<p>I was able to do the best I could in the time available to me.</p>



<p>As for the continuation of the book, the light novel industry seems to be even more challenging these days, and I don&#8217;t know if it can be published, but… assuming positively that it can get published, I’m also starting to write the second volume of the book (jumping the gun on my own).</p>



<p>In the case continuing publication is possible, it will be mostly completely new written work from the next one.</p>



<p>Lastly, I would like to thank everyone involved.</p>



<p>Thank you very much Hizuki Higure-sama for the wonderful illustration. I shuddered when I saw the character designs, the cover sketch and so on, it was too amazing.</p>



<p>Thank you to everyone involved in proofreading, revising, designing, and printing! Without everyone, this work would not have taken shape and been released to the world.</p>



<p>And Take-chan, who became my editor… Thank you for helping move the work forward together while I have been taking on a position and getting busier with more things to do.</p>
