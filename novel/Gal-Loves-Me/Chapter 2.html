<h3>Chapter 2 – The Relationship Progressed, Huh?</h3>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>Shino kept the promise with Sandai, maintained a sense of distance close to prior to their meeting, and didn&#8217;t get involved with him at all at school.</p>



<p>The rumors continued to fly about nevertheless, but around the time it became after-school, there were some who began to cool off like: ‘Maybe it was just coincidence they were together this morning, and we just had a weird misunderstanding…’</p>



<p>It was moving in a good direction.</p>



<p>Sandai finished packing up to go home, passed by Shino with a blank look on his face, and got out of the classroom while yawning.</p>



<p>And then got called by a female teacher wearing a white robe.</p>



<p>Nakaoka Kayoko—the homeroom teacher of Sandai’s class, and also a chemistry teacher. She should be in the age of thirty this year or… something along those lines.</p>



<p>“Heeey Fujiwara! Come over here!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;What is it?”</p>



<p>“There’s something I want a bit of help with, you see.”</p>



<p>“Help?”</p>



<p>Sandai got confidence in his own loner-derived stealth ability, and was a bit surprised as he had never been asked of something ever since enrollment.</p>



<p>Well, he had gotten a bit conspicuous lately due to his involvement with Shino, so it wouldn’t be strange for his stealth ability to become useless, however.</p>



<p>“You’re in the go-home club, right? I just thought you seem to have time. Anyway, just help me. You don’t have anything to do anyway, don’t you?”</p>



<p>“It’s not that I have none, though. I mean, I study and stuff.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Speaking of which, you were first in the overall school year, huh. That said, it sure doesn’t seem like you were on your wits’ end desperately defending your rank. Don’t you have a lot of leeway in your study progress?”</p>



<p>“For the time being, I can at the very least get 80% on the National University Admission Test if I take it now…”</p>



<p>“That’s a top ranker level of super advanced high school if you can get that much now in your second year, alright? Just why someone like you is in our mediocre high school…”</p>



<p>“This place is the closest to my apartment, so I chose here. Studying can be done at any school. I suppose I also had the choice of advanced high school if I want to study hard and have an endless competition in the same space with people who are as good or better than me at studying, but it’s not like I’m looking for something like that, so…”</p>



<p>“So you made a rational decision that sat well with you, huh… Well, I don’t care about what your personal choice criteria is, though.”</p>



<p>“You don’t… Then why did you bring it up?”</p>



<p>“Too much studying isn’t good for the body either. I wanted to have a talk about something like that. Come on, let’s go.”</p>



<p>“Eh, wai—”</p>



<p>Grabbed by the collar of his school uniform by Nakaoka, Sandai was pulled and dragged away. Even if he tried to escape, Nakaoka’s strength was unexpectedly strong, so he wasn’t able to break free from her.</p>



<p>Where they arrived was the school history reference room. There were various things such as documents and stuff placed in a very disorganized manner. According to what he heard, it seemed she wanted him to work together with her organizing this place.</p>



<p>“&#8230;It would’ve taken me until dusk if I were on my own after all. You’re a lifesaver.”</p>



<p>Sandai would love to end this quickly and go home, so he began to organize matter-of-factly without even returning a reply.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Though, “By the way Fujiwara, lately… you seem to be close with Yuizaki, huh,” it was Nakaoka’s fault for saying a weird thing that his hands stopped moving. “Actually it’s a hot topic among the teaching staff, you see. Even today there was a teacher who mentioned it in a small talk.”</p>



<p>“How should I put it… well, our seats are also back to back after all. That aside, let’s just get this place organized quickly.” Sandai evaded it and tried to let the topic drop.</p>



<p>Nakaoka, however, was unbudged.</p>



<p>“Don’t be cold like that. I just thought it was unusual that Yuizaki got involved with a man, you see. You might not know this as a loner, but Yuizaki avoids men, and acts hostile towards them at times. Male students are, of course, subject to this, and male teachers as well. …This thing is like, if she feels she’s seen as a woman for even a moment before getting to know one another, she will put up a wall. She seems to not care much about other people’s eyes, but at the same time, she is a girl who is awfully sensitive towards the oppposite sex.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Well, if you were that pretty, it’s not that I don’t understand, though. I’m sure there were times she was made to feel various unpleasant feelings. It’s a kind of self-defense.”</p>



<p>Nakaoka seemed to want to talk about Shino from the beginning; it was such a way of starting a talk. The ‘helping’ was just an excuse.</p>



<p>“However, half of the people in the world are men, and that’s an unchanging fact in spite of all the effort made. The grace period for high school students to become an adult is not that long, and legally they will become an adult while still enrolled; with the age of majority being 18 years old and all. Well, you’ll still continue to be treated like a child while still a student, and from there, the grace period will extend if you go to college, but… you’re going to go out into society sooner or later. Over time, you’ll encounter situations where you can’t be selfish and avoid men because you’re not good with them. It’s only now that you’re being forgiven, worried about, and taken into consideration for ‘being not good with X’.”</p>



<p>“That is… well… I suppose as you say.”</p>



<p>“That’s how it is. If I were to state it briefly and conclusively, this is how I would put it to you: date Yuizaki,” Nakaoka uttered something outrageous with a nonchalant look.</p>



<p>Sandai opened his eyes wide in surprise. “Wha…”</p>



<p>“What’s with that fish-brought-on-land face? For the record, I’m not suggesting this just for the fun of it, but also for a good reason.”</p>



<p>“Rea&#8230; Reason?”</p>



<p>“Because It will help in overcoming Yuizaki’s sense of ‘I’m not good with men.’ If she gets to know a man, she will not have to be pointlessly afraid of them. Even if it doesn’t reach dating, due to the process to arrive at that result, it would be a welcome thing if Yuizaki was able to get used to men even if only a little. Or what, are you trying to say to that cute little Yuizaki that ‘she should continue to suffer from being not good with and not understanding the sense of distance with men’? Is that what you’re thinking? Which is it? Hmm?”</p>



<p>“It’s so sudden, I don’t know how I should…”</p>



<p>“And then it’s also for your sake to get close to Yuizaki.”</p>



<p>“For my sake…?”</p>



<p>“Because you’re always alone and putting on a face that’s saying that school isn’t fun. It’s clearly visible from the teacher podium. If you take action, create some chemical reactions in your life, and turn that dull youth into a bright-colored one, school surely will also get a little fun.”</p>



<p>Nakaoka’s expression was soft and gentle; that was the face of a teacher thinking about her student. Even Sandai understood that the suggestion was out of Nakaoka’s own thinking—that no matter how it would turn out, it would be very likely to turn into a good outcome for them both.</p>



<p>Though, it was certainly not a suggestion that he could just unthinkingly nod his head to and say: ‘Yes, I understand.’</p>



<p>“I understand what you are trying to say, Sensei. But… there’s also Yuizaki’s feelings, and besides, I’ve also never thought about wanting to be in a relationship like that, though.”</p>



<p>“You hate Yuizaki?”</p>



<p>“I don’t hate her, but…”</p>



<p>“Then that means you like her. There’s no problem.”</p>



<p>“If you don’t hate it, then you must like it… Isn’t that logic a bit weird?”</p>



<p>“What a troublesome guy you are… Have you got no assertiveness? Huh? Have the guts to forcefully make her look back at you. Show enough desire to get her into a good mood and ravish her. Be a wolf! Rawr! Rawr rawr!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Are you seriously saying that?”</p>



<p>“I’m serious.”</p>



<p>“I think it’s not good for a person to force themselves on someone, and besides I think normally you’d just get hated.”</p>



<p>“That will change depending on the prior likeability. Ascertainment is important, it’s the key here. You don’t try to understand the complex woman’s heart with logic, but grasp it with intuition.”</p>



<p>Shino didn’t seem to have that type of a troublesome personality, but all that aside, it was an intuition Sandai couldn’t grasp at all.</p>



<p>“I think intuition like that is kind of impossible for me to understand… Well, it doesn’t really matter, but no matter how much you try to fire me up, I don’t have the will for it. Even if Yuizaki did get involved with me somewhat, I think she is thinking that she really is not good with me either. I also know that Yuizaki is not good with men. So…”</p>



<p>“Inside Yuizaki, you are maybe… the first man she’s not at all uncomfortable with, you know? Or maybe… she’s waiting for you to approach her. Nah, it’s also possible she’s thinking of making a move from her end.”</p>



<p>There was a slight smile on Nakaoka’s face. In addition to being concerned about her students as a teacher, it was apparent that she was trying to have some personal fun by teasing a troubled youth.</p>



<p>“Maybe this, maybe that… In the first place, it was only recently me and Yuizaki made contact with each other, and the reason and time to come to like one another as well…”</p>



<p>Sandai frowned, and Nakaoka unnaturally shrugged her shoulders.</p>



<p>“Falling in love has nothing to do with reason and time. Virgins are quick to seek that in love, but it’s a bad habit. Are you happy to be told, ‘Actually, I’ve liked you for a long time,’? Even though ‘I didn’t like you enough to take action right away’ just equals being kept as a Mr. Backup. If the past events were deftly decorated, you’ll be tricked into thinking, ‘I see, so since that time…’ and stuff.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that too suspecting of a view?”</p>



<p>“No, it isn’t. Also, it’s a terrible thing to say you like someone because you have a reason. Humans are multifaceted creatures; only if you truly love someone, only if you love their many faces, will you find it difficult to find the reason for liking them. ‘Like’ with a clear reason is too light if you ask me; because it means the ‘like’ is only that much.”</p>



<p>What Nakaoka was saying was undoubtedly outside of the typical common sense. However, It was strange as it sounded strangely persuasive when asserted this way.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>



				

<p>It was dusk when Sandai was released from the never-ending conversation with Nakaoka.</p>



<p>Having grown tired of Sandai continuously taking indecisive attitude, Nakaoka folded up, with a sigh said, “Well, just think about it,” and ended it. The organizing of the school history reference room was brought to a finish as well.</p>



<p>Completely mentally exhausted, Sandai returned to his home, unsteadily entered his own room, and plopped down on the bed immediately after.</p>



<p>“I just wanna go straight to sleep…”</p>



<p>He was being urged by such an impulse. Though, he would have to do something before that; in the morning, he’d promised to contact Shino later.</p>



<p>Sandai slowly got up and booted up the messaging app on his phone. Firstly he added Shino’s ID, and then tried to send a message to her… and his hands stopped.</p>



<p>The various things Nakaoka had told him flickered in his mind. Somehow he felt like his current self was facing an important crossroad, making his fingers stop moving.</p>



<p>Time passed by just like that in the time Sandai remained frozen, and it was already nine when he realized it.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I mustn&#8217;t think about unnecessary things. I should completely forget Sensei’s words. Trying to send a message will be harder and harder the more I think about it.” Sandai forcibly emptied his head. And then, albeit slowly, his fingers began to move. “And like… this.”</p>



<p>Sandai decided to send the message with only his name on it, as letting her know that the sender was him would be fine for the time being.</p>



<p>Sandai hit send, and a strange sense of accomplishment and fatigue hit him at the same time.</p>



<p>Sandai tried to get some drink to take a breather—only to get startled by his phone ringing.</p>



<p>He nervously checked it, and it was from Shino.</p>





<p>*I’ve been waiting~.*</p>


<p>“It hasn’t even been one minute since I sent the message, though…” Not expecting such a speedy reply, Sandai gulped down his saliva while sweat oozed out of his forehead. “&#8230;I’ve gotta respond to Yuizaki’s reply, don’t I?”</p>



<p>Sandai frettingly began to think what to reply, but before he could even send any text, follow-up messages from Shino came one after another.</p>




<p>*Thanks for keeping the promise.*</p>



<p>*I was so nervous, wondering when I would hear from you.*</p>



<p>*By the way, it’s funny it’s just your name. You sure have humor.*</p>





<p>In the face of super speed follow-ups with no thought of his pace, Sandai thought that it just might be easier to pretend he hadn’t seen it and later send a ‘My bad, I didn’t see it’ message as an excuse, but a feature of the messaging app put that to a stop.</p>



<p>This app would show ‘Read,’ telling the other side that it was seen. Leaving no reply would be equal to ignoring it. He couldn’t use the excuse that he hadn’t seen it.</p>



<p>“What do I do… That’s right… I guess I’ll start by telling her I’m not used to an app like this.”</p>



<p>Thinking result: Sandai decided to be honest and tell her his current situation for the time being. Honesty would be best at a time like this. Probably.</p>



<p>“Errr… ‘My bad, I’ve been a loner so this is the first time for me to contact someone. I think my reply is going to be slow, or there could be some confusion, but please do excuse me.’ …There.”</p>





<p>*Realsies? Kay!*</p>



<p>“‘Realsies?’ and ‘Kay’? What’s this? I don’t get it. I beg you, please use proper language.”</p>



<p>Sandai would like to ignore the words he got no idea at all what it meant, but remaining clueless would make understanding one another difficult, so he inevitably asked the meaning.</p>



<p>And then—</p>





<p>*Realsies? is the slang for for real?, and kay is short for okay~.*</p>




<p>“Ah, I see. So it&#8217;s slang and short for it.”</p>



<p>Such exchange of messages with Shino continued for pretty long.</p>



<p>Shino was beginning to slow down her pace, allowing Sandai a bit of breathing room, and the conversation started to roll fairly nicely.</p>



<p>In the middle of such a casual chat, Shino suddenly mentioned she’d like to go to Sandai’s home next Sunday.</p>







<p>*Can I come to your place next Sunday? So I make confections at work, and I want to practice that. Let’s make it together.*</p>







<p>Sandai questioned whether his no-experience-at-making-confectionaries self could be of any help in the practice. He checked with Shino just in case, and she replied, ‘It’s okay.’</p>



<p>If the one proposing it said so, then it surely would be okay. As for letting her into his home, Sandai didn’t feel any reluctance since he had already had her in twice.</p>



<p>With the time starting to get late, the chat ended with sending,‘Good night,’ to one another.</p>



<p>“&#8230;What’s the time now? Already time for anime, huh.” He looked at the clock, and saw it was five minutes before late-night anime.</p>



<p>Sandai was sleepy, but not watching wasn’t an option, so he slept after watching late-night anime.</p>






<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>






<p>In the time leading to the following Sunday, they spent their days feigning indifference to each other at school, but exchanging silly messages at home at night.</p>



<p>Attention from other students began to decrease significantly. Even Nakaoka who had tattled on and on; perhaps taking a wait-and-see approach, she didn’t try to meddle even if she were to give a suspecting gaze.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Sunday came. Sandai changed into his outside clothes, headed to the station, and sat on the bench on the platform, waiting for Shino to arrive.</p>



<p>Shino got off the train that came shortly after.</p>



<p>Sandai waved his hand. Shino noticed it and went to rush to him in a small jog.</p>



<p>“Did you wait?”</p>



<p>“I just got here.”</p>



<p>“Thank god~.”</p>



<p>Shino was naturally wearing plain clothing as it was a day off, putting on a casual getup of short-ish cropped pants, a white shirt with polka dots, and then flower-patterned sandals. She was also holding a big-ish wicker basket with the inside unknown to him.</p>



<p>Although it was now entering the last third of September, there were still many days with high temperatures. And today was one such day, so Shino seemed to be dressed in summer clothing</p>



<p>As Sandai had only ever seen Shino in school uniform, the plain clothing gave off some fresh feeling.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Shall we go?” Sandai asked and got up from the bench.</p>



<p>“Wait a minute,” and then Shino put the brakes on. “Umm… It’s gonna be so sudden and I’m sorry, but…” Shino was scratching her cheek with an apologetic look, and then a small girl suddenly and timidly came out from behind her.</p>



<p>Sandai tilted his head at the appearance of the mysterious girl.</p>



<p>“Umm… When I left home, she suddenly said she’d come along with me.”</p>



<p>“Eh… Came along with you when you left home? Don’t tell me, Yuizaki… have you been a… mother of one?”</p>



<p>“Y-You are wrong!” Shino waved her hands and denied it in panic. “Who even has a kid this big at my age!? I mean I’m a virgin, how could I even have a—n-no, forget what I just said.”</p>



<p>Apparently it wasn’t her daughter, but when given some thought, Shino was still a high school student and moreover not good with men; there was no way she was having a child.</p>



<p><em>I’ve made a misunderstanding that can be easily figured out if I think about it calmly,</em> Sandai reflected as he scratched his cheek.</p>



<p>“Err, I think I’ve mentioned it before, but I have a little sister. And it’s this girl. I knew I should’ve let you know when I was on the train, but… it’s just hard to bring up, you see.”</p>



<p>Shino had indeed said she got a little sister before. Sandai remembered that as well.</p>



<p>“Come on, say hello to Onii-chan.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Nice to meet you. I’m Miki.”</p>



<p>Shino’s little sister—Miki looked a lot like Shino, as one would expect from sisters.</p>



<p>The only difference that could be discerned at first glance, apart from the color of Shino’s dyed hair, would perhaps be around the eyes.</p>



<p>In contrast to Shino’s distinct double eyelid, Miki also got a pretty double eyelid but hers were droopy eyes.</p>



<p>“Nice to meet you, Miki-chan.”</p>



<p>“O-Ohay…” Miki shut her eyes tight and looked down; not scared, but seemed embarrassed.</p>



<p>“I’m really sorry, Fujiwara…”&nbsp;</p>



<p>“You don’t have to apologize.”</p>



<p>“It wouldn’t be good if I troubled you, so I did tell her to be a good girl and play with Mom and Dad at home, though.”</p>



<p>“I don’t think it’s any trouble at all so it’s fine, really… It’s just maybe, but Miki-chan, could it be that you love your Onee-chan so that’s why you wanted to be with her?”</p>



<p>Sandai crouched down and smiled, only for Miki to smile pleasantly and give a small nod.</p>



<p>“Yup. Miki loves Onee-chan.”</p>



<p>An innocent girl befitting her apparent age; that was how it seemed to Sandai. Though, Shino was making an indescribable expression as she was watching the whole thing from the side.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong, Yuizaki? What’s with that face?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’ll let you know ahead of time, but Miki is a girl who instantly turns into a rascal once she gets along with someone. She’s good at playing innocent, so try to not get fooled,” said Shino, only for Miki to avert her eyes away.</p>



<p>And she said, “Onee-chan, still mad about yesterday…?”</p>



<p>“Nn? Well of course.”</p>



<p>“Don’t be so mad like that… It’s ‘cause Miki thought a small melon might fit in your bra, Onee-chan… and then it fit…”</p>



<p>“Even so you don’t go swing it around and play with it like that! Both the strap and hook got broken, you know!?”</p>



<p>“Your boobs’ unexpected bigness is at fault, you know…”</p>



<p>“No, it’s not.”</p>



<p>“What a selfish body…”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Where did you even learn those words?”</p>



<p>“It was on TV.”</p>



<p>“You lose nothing in not watching that kinda thing.”</p>



<p>They were talking about something terrific, like playing with a bra or something. Miki appeared to be a well-behaved girl, but it was actually like Shino had said; she seemed to just be playing innocent, and her true character was quite free and wild.</p>



<p>Sandai knew it was not something he should listen to so attentively, so he blocked his ears with his hands for now.</p>






<p><em>“Nn? Huh, that Onii-chan blocked his ears. Oh well, it’s just right. Heh hey, Onee-chan, got a minute?”</em></p>



<p><em>“What.”</em></p>



<p><em>“You were talking about going to a friend’s home, but it’s not a girl’s home, huh?”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;I’ve never said anything that it’s a female friend’s home, you know?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Is it better to not tell Dad and Mom? You were hiding it from Miki, too, so that means you also haven’t told them, right?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I-I’m thinking of telling them one of these days, but we don’t have that kind of relationship yet, too… umm… I hope you don’t tell them if you can.”</em></p>



<p><em>“That kind of relationship? Yet? Hmm… fufu… Miki doesn’t really get it, but if you want to, then Miki will stay silent. But instead, go smoochie smooch with that Onii-chan in front of Miki, okay?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Eh?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Miki saw a smoochie in a drama, and then, Miki got curious how it will be like in real life and wants to see it. That’s why, Miki will stay silent if you smoochie smooch. It’s not like you hate that Onii-chan, right? It’s the first time Miki saw you interacting with a man other than Dad, Onee-chan. If anything, you like him, right?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Now that you said it… I like him… I guess?”</em></p>



<p><em>“You guess? What’s that now? Miki will tell Dad and Mom, okay?”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;I like him, I think.”</em></p>



<p><em>“You think?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I-I like him. I like him! Is this okay now?”</em></p>



<p><em>“So you do like him. Miki hears momentum is important in something like this, so come on and make the decision today.”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;”</em></p>




<p>Their quarrel seemed to have stopped, so Sandai dropped the hands covering his ears.</p>



<p>He didn’t know what they had been talking about, but Miki was grinning, while Shino was fiddling around with her bangs with her face red up to her ears.</p>



<p><em>Why is Yuizaki blushing—Ah, I see. The anger about the bra thing has calmed down, but the embarrassment is still there, isn’t it? </em>Sandai made such a guess, <em>it’s probably that</em>. And then he vowed that would try not to say a word that would be associated with that if possible.</p>



<p>It would be a different story if Sandai had a hobby of making people get into an uncomfortable mood, but he got no such warped fetish.</p>



<p>Now, having grasped what to look out for in a conversation, Sandai headed for his apartment with them as they couldn’t just stand around forever.</p>



<p>It wasn’t that far from the station, so they reached there after a few minutes&#8217; walk</p>



<p>“&#8230;Onee-chan, Onee-chan.”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“Kind of exciting, isn’t it? A multi-floor building like this is nowhere near home.”</p>



<p>“Rather than a multi-floor building, it’s an apartment, okay?”</p>



<p>Upon passing through the entrance, Miki suddenly began to gingerly look around. It seemed to spark her interest as apparently there was no such apartment near Yuizaki’s home.</p>



<p>Yuizaki’s home was an hour’s train ride away; Sandai remembered hearing about it. Further out of the suburbs distance-wise… that would be a bit rural already.</p>



<p>In many ways, it seemed to be a new experience for Miki who was still very young and probably also got little opportunities to go out into the urban area.</p>



<p>“&#8230;You shouldn’t look around so much like that, Miki. It’s not like near our home. I don’t care if someone gets mad at you, okay?”</p>



<p>“Who’s gonna get mad? For now, Onii-chan doesn’t look angry, you know? Then that means just a little bit is okay, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>Miki’s deduction wasn’t mistaken; Sandai wasn’t bothered by Miki’s behavior because in this apartment there was an unspoken agreement of mutual nonintervention between residents.</p>



<p>No one would frown just because a very young child was unable to calm down.</p>



<p>Yet, earlier than Sandai could defend Miki’s words and actions, “But still,” Shino flicked Miki’s forehead.</p>



<p>“Owie… What’re you doing, Onee-chan?”</p>



<p>“Even if no one cares or is angry, it doesn’t mean bad manners are A-OK.”</p>



<p>“Unlike how you look, you are straight-laced on the inside, huh, Onee-chan… haahh… Maybe smoochie smooch is impossible.”</p>



<p>“Smoochie smooch is… err well…”</p>



<p>Smoochie smooch or something—Sandai wasn’t really sure what Shino and Miki were talking about halfway through, but anyway, although late, he told Shino why he didn’t mind Miki’s behavior.</p>



<p>Though, despite hearing what Sandai said, “Nuh-uh,” Shino shook her head, not yielding. “Even if no one cares, bad manners aren’t good,” said Shino.</p>



<p>Both in terms of morals and education towards children, Shino was on the right. Sandai kept silent, as he was unable to make any counterargument and felt that putting up a petty resistance might cause unnecessary discord.</p>



<p>Upon entering his home and heading for the kitchen, Shino began pulling out various cooking utensils from the wicker basket she had brought while humming a tune.</p>



<p>“Ooh… So these are utensils for making confectionaries. It uses various things, huh.”</p>



<p>“Well yeah. Now all we need is an oven.”</p>



<p>“Oven? There&#8217;s probably none here.”</p>



<p>“There is, y’know?”</p>



<p>“How could you know?”</p>



<p>“I made breakfast here last time, right? I found the oven then, so I know there’s one. It’s this one.” Tap-tap, Shino tapped a box in the corner of the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If Sandai wasn’t mistaken, that box had always been there according to his memory.</p>



<p>He wasn’t certain since when it had been there, and had only been aware that it was a box he didn’t really know that looked like a microwave oven but somehow different, however…</p>



<p>“So that was an oven, huh…”</p>



<p>“Eh? You didn’t kno… wait, come to think of it you don’t cook and stuff, don’t you? Then I guess it can’t be helped if you don’t know since you don’t use it…”</p>



<p>“I’m extremely happy to have your understanding.”</p>



<p>“No shame?”</p>



<p>“I don’t really care about that. More importantly, something is kinda bothering me…”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Something is bothering you?”</p>



<p>“I don’t see Miki-chan anywhere. So where did she go?”</p>



<p>For some reason Sandai couldn’t find Miki anywhere; though, Sandai had noticed after arriving at the kitchen.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“Huh?” Shino tilted her head, apparently noticing it once Sandai pointed it out. “You’re right. I wonder where she went…”</p>



<p>“She should’ve been with us when we passed the front door, so I think she’s probably somewhere in here, but… I’m gonna go look over there.”</p>



<p>“Okay, please do.”</p>



<p>They split into two and began the search for Miki.</p>



<p>There were multiple rooms, but it wasn’t as big as a detached house, so Miki was found rather quickly. Sandai spotted her lying down on the sofa in the living room.</p>



<p>“There you are, Miki-chan.”</p>



<p>“Wuh?”</p>



<p>“She is here!”</p>



<p>“Okaaay!”</p>



<p>Shino rushed over in response to Sandai’s finding report; then narrowed her eyes in displeasure the second she saw Miki.</p>



<p>She was angry.</p>



<p>“Miki…”</p>



<p>“You’re making scary face, Onee-chan…”</p>



<p>“Listen here, this is not your home, Miki. It’s this Onii-chan’s. It would be rude and just causing trouble if you acted like it’s your own home, right?”</p>



<p>“Even if you say that.”</p>



<p>“Even if I say it… what?”</p>



<p>“No, it’s nothing. That aside, Miki’s specialty is eating, so you two go ahead and make it, ‘kay?”</p>



<p>Miki didn’t seem to feel guilty to a surprising degree, and Shino glared at her. Though, that was only for an instant.</p>



<p>Shino gradually lost vigor and hung her head down, her face somehow looking like she could cry at any moment.</p>



<p>“&#8230;What is it you want, what am I gonna do if even I the big sister got seen as a selfish woman because you’re like that. What am I gonna do if Fujiwara hates me…”</p>



<p>The words spilled out by Shino sounded slightly shaky; furthermore, the volume was too low making Sandai unable to hear them clearly.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, having thought that he should cheer Shino up if she was down despite not knowing what she said, Sandai tried to say something to her.</p>



<p>However, his mouth didn’t move for some reason—his hand did.</p>



<p>The hand moved on its own, and Sandai found himself patting Shino’s head. That was truly an unconscious action.</p>



<p>“Eh… Wai…”</p>



<p>By suddenly getting patted on the head, although obvious, Shino was surprised, but she immediately blushed and cast her eyes down.</p>



<p>There was no sign of her resisting.</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“Miki hasn’t eaten any sweets yet, but Miki’s belly seems full already… If it’s like this, maybe smoochie smooch will be pretty easy?”</p>



<p>It was when Miki sniffled that Sandai realized what he was doing. He hurriedly withdrew his hand and quickly stepped away from Shino.</p>



<p>“I…”</p>



<p>Sandai swallowed a gulp of his saliva and stared intently at his own hand. What he suddenly recalled was Nakaoka’s words.</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/N95b7R9/tbeyqfg.jpg"  border="0"></a>

<p style= "text-align:center;">★</p>



<p>‘What a troublesome guy you are… Have you got no assertiveness? Huh? Have the guts to forcefully make her look back at you. Show enough desire to get her into a good mood and ravish her. Be a wolf! Rawr! Rawr rawr!’</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;">★</p>




<p>Sandai wasn’t taking Nakaoka’s words that seriously.</p>



<p>Something certainly did come to his mind; nevertheless, the thought of not wanting to make a dark past by making a move just as he was being fired up was stronger.</p>



<p>Part of him also didn’t want to put Shino on the spot by making a weird misunderstanding.</p>



<p>Despite all that, his body had moved on its own.</p>



<p>Sandai was becoming increasingly confused about what was going on. He desperately tried to think and find the reason for his own action, but no matter how hard he tried to, he couldn’t arrive at the right answer.</p>



<p>As a last resort, Sandai now decided to forcibly change the subject to run away from this question.</p>



<p>He thought: if the topic changes, the mood will change; if the mood changes, he won’t think of unnecessary things; and then he should be back to his usual self.</p>



<p>“Come to think of it… there’s no ingredients for confectionery making!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;I was thinking of going shopping while asking you about your taste preferences.”</p>



<p>“I see! Then we’ve gotta go do some shopping!”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Okay.”</p>



<p>Shino looked at him with puppy eyes. Her eyes were teary-eyed, and Sandai recoiled back and turned his face away in response.</p>



<p>He felt like he wouldn’t be able to retain his sanity were he to continue looking at her in the eyes.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Even though it was just so close~,” Miki whispered to herself, shrugging her shoulders as she watched their closeness. “Onii-chan, he sure got surprisingly strong self-kontrol. No, just barely?”</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>



<p>Upon heading out to buy ingredients for confections, Sandai began to calm down as he felt the mood had somehow changed.</p>



<p>It seemed he was right in the judgment of: if the topic changes, the mood will change.</p>



<p>However, whereas Sandai was feeling relieved, Miki said she wanted to go to a big place that also got a game arcade—to a large commercial complex—as opposed to Shino who tried to go to a store specializing in confectionery ingredients, leading to almost another quarrel between two sisters.</p>



<p>However, a quarrel to the point of a definite fallout never occurred, and the next thing he knew, Shino and Miki made up and began having a stealthy secret talk.</p>


<p><em>“Geez… Come on, just be a good girl, I’m asking you.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Hmm?”</em></p>



<p><em>“W-What?”</em></p>



<p><em>“The mood earlier was good, wasn’t it? Miki doing what she pleases, and when you got down, Onii-chan patted you, wasn’t it?”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;Somehow you sounded like you were aiming for that, though?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Miki was, though?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Eh? Realsies?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Realsies.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Hm-Hmm…?”</em></p>



<p><em>“And so, ‘good news’ for you, Onee-chan… Earlier Onii-chan looked like he fell, you know? He was making a falling-in-love face when patting your head. That’s why this is when you go for an attack. Cover it as an accident, then ‘smooch.’ Nothing to get scared of. Momentum is important, okay?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Miki… aren’t you kinda enjoying it?”</em></p>



<p><em>“It’s fine too if you think that way. ‘Cause you’re the one who chooses, Onee-chan. It’s just… you can cover it up as a natural accident better at bigger stores, you know? And Miki can go play at the game arcade to stay away, too. Gotta get some money to play games, though.”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;”</em></p>



<p><em>“It’ll probably annoy Onii-chan if you decide so slowly, and it’s better to quickly decide if you don’t wanna get hated, y’know?”</em></p>



<p><em>“I-I got it. There’s some point in what you said, too… I’m in. Getting all indecisive isn’t in my nature anyway, so I’m seriously gonna do it. I’ve made up my mind.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Nn.”</em></p>



<p>What they could’ve been whispering about? Sandai had not the slightest idea, but was told only that they’d decided to go according to Miki’s demand.</p>



<p>They arrived at a large commercial complex, and Miki immediately started to look for the game arcade. The game arcade was on the second floor.</p>



<p>Miki raised a voice of delight at the sight of the rows of flashing machines.</p>



<p>“Nyufufu, now then, Miki will go play here alone until you two are done shopping.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;It’s late but are you gonna be fine alone?”</p>



<p>“There’s a person at the counter just right there, so it’s fine. You go worry about yourself instead of Miki.”</p>



<p>“You cheeky mouth…”</p>



<p>“Money.”</p>



<p>“Here 500 yen.”</p>



<p>“500 yen, huh… You can only play the crane game a few times with this. Miki just can’t kill time with this unless it’s a medal game. No, maybe it’s still gonna be tough.”</p>



<p>“Don’t go saying selfish things. I mean, I’m not rich either.”</p>



<p>“Yeah Miki knows…”</p>



<p>Miki frowned and groaned. She seemed to not be satisfied with the amount of spending money given by Shino, but well, it was also true that the amount of time she could spend playing wouldn’t be that big.</p>



<p>Sandai didn’t plan to go shopping for a long time, but he felt finishing it in five or ten minutes would also be tough.</p>



<p>Shino had said she would ask about his preferences and stuff. In other words, that meant they wouldn’t go buying ingredients decided beforehand, so finishing it in a flash would be impossible.</p>



<p>Almost certain that Miki would use up the money and wait for them, but… Sandai imagined such a sight of Miki and began to somewhat feel pity for her, so he took out a 500 yen coin from his own wallet and made her hold it in her hand.</p>



<p>“Onii-chan…?”</p>



<p>“That makes it a thousand yen. Now you can play a little longer, can’t you?”</p>



<p>“Thank you! …Fufufu, alright, then Miki will tell you something nice as thanks, Onii-chan.”</p>



<p>“Something nice…?”</p>



<p>“Lend Miki your ear.”</p>



<p>Despite tilting his head quizzically, Sandai lent her his ear as told.</p>



<p>“&#8230;You see, Onee-chan is surprisingly scatterbrained. She sometimes misses her step on the stairs or something. That’s why at that time you go ‘squeeze’ her, and protect her so she doesn’t get hurt, okay? Miki thinks she’ll miss her step today.”</p>



<p>That was such strangely specific advice—as if she knew what would happen, so to speak.</p>



<p>Sandai tilted his head even further only for Miki to just gallop away into the game arcade.</p>



<p>“&#8230;You don’t have to give Miki money. She’ll learn she can get it if she complains.”</p>



<p>Shino let out a sigh next to him.</p>



<p>It was probably true that it was bad for education, but in Sandai’s eyes Miki just looked oh-so pitiful.</p>



<p>Besides, “It’s not like I’m doing it everyday, and in the first place weren’t you also giving Miki-chan spending money?”</p>



<p>“There’s… a reason…”</p>



<p>“Reason? Now I don’t know about all that, but you certainly can’t say anything about me when you yourself are also giving her spending money. Well, I mean, look, wanting to play when going out is what kids do, so don’t you think it’s fine just for today?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You seem like you would spoil your kid so much if you had one, huh, Fujiwara.”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“Sure is. I can somehow imagine your life after marriage. I feel like you’ll be a kind papa.”</p>



<p>“So you say, but I sure don’t think I can even get a girlfriend before the marriage, though. I’m a loner. Not even do I encounter anyone.”</p>



<p>“I think there are also loners who have a girlfriend or are married, though? I mean, even you had an encounter. Don’t you feel like … that other person is very close by right now?”</p>



<p>That was very a suggestive remark, and it made Sandai want to ask back what that meant.</p>



<p>However, he felt like there ultimately would be no turning back once he knew the answer, making him get cold feet and unable to ask.</p>



<p>“I feel like… there is, but… I also feel like there… isn’t.” Such a reply was the best he could give.</p>



<p>“I see… like there is, and there isn’t?”</p>



<p>“Tha-That’s right. It’s like that.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Hmmmm?” Shino narrowed her eyes; her expression was as if to examine, to probe. At the end of that gaze was Sandai’s lips, but the person being looked at was unaware of it.</p>



<p>He was sensing only that the air around Shino had changed slightly, but that was all.</p>



<p>Though, no matter how dense Sandai might be, if the things called feelings were to actually be put into action, he would have no choice but to understand them.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>5</strong></p>



<p>They proceeded with their shopping in the confectionery ingredients selling area in the upper floor while talking about flavors, shapes, and such, and were done after about 30 minutes.</p>



<p>Now they just had to meet Miki—however, they oh-so unluckily got stuck in traffic. There were lines formed for both the escalator and the elevator, making it seem impossible to immediately get to the second floor where Miki was.</p>



<p>They joined the line for the time being, but somewhere on the front queue jumping happened each time the line moved forward a bit, forcing them to step back and leaving them unmoved from their initial position.</p>



<p>He understood in his head that for it to be crowded was a given since it was Sunday, and that he should just accept it, but he was getting irritated nonetheless.</p>



<p>Sandai’s face was gradually turning into a scowl. And then Shino tugged his sleeve.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“&#8230;Let’s just use the stairs,” Shino said as if to mutter and pointed to a corner of the floor. “It’s over there, so…”</p>



<p>The stairway quietly lay in that empty place.</p>



<p>“&#8230;The stairs, huh.”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>“The line doesn’t look like clearing either. Sure, we can take the stairs.”</p>



<p>It was also certain that continuing to stand in line would just be a waste of time, so Sandai decided to go with Shino’s suggestion.</p>



<p>They went down the quiet, empty stairway. Tac, tac—Sandai was the first to set foot down on the second floor along with the echo of his footsteps.</p>



<p>In the next moment—</p>



<p>“Kya!”</p>



<p>—He could hear Shino’s scream.</p>



<p>Sandai turned around in surprise to find Shino diving at him, seeming to have broken her posture.</p>



<p>“Oh no, I’m falling down.”</p>



<p>That was a very monotone voice, but Sandai had not even the time to notice such a thing. He hurriedly caught Shino in his arms in order to save her.</p>



<p>“Watch out!”</p>



<p>And then—</p>



<p>Thud—his back ate the floor hard.</p>



<p>While enduring the coming pain, Sandai slowly opened his eyelids—only for him to open it even wider in surprise. After all, there was Shino’s face right in front of his eyes with her eyelids closed.</p>



<p>Late did he notice the soft, slightly sweet feeling overlapping his own lips. He nervously checked, and found that it was Shino’s lips.</p>



<p>“&#8230;??”</p>



<p>He couldn’t fathom it. He had only caught Shino in his arms to save her—yet he was kissing her for some reason.</p>



<p>After a good ten seconds with their lips overlapping one another, Sandai’s eyes caught the sight of Miki rushing towards them.</p>



<p>Having attracted a glance from Shino, grinning, Miki said, “Miki was waiting around wondering when you’re gonna show up, but… really… you did it flashily, huh? Are you okay?”&nbsp;</p>



<p>After her own pupils dilating as wide as a cat’s at night, her cheeks taking on a reddish pink color like peach petals, Shino broke her gaze from Miki, and went to give a follow-up attack to Sandai whose mind was coming to a stop.</p>



<p>He overlapped her lips on his again.</p>



<p>The second kiss was brief. After immediately making a ‘chu’ sound of lips parting, Shino’s face pulled away.</p>



<p>“&#8230;Thanks for saving me. It’s a coincidence, but we kissed, huh. We did… something you shouldn’t do unless you’re lovers. Fujiwara, I… calling you like that makes some kind of distance, so I’ll call you by your first name from now on, okay? Sandai… I like you.”</p>



<p>That was too sudden of a confession. Sandai’s head instantly went blank, only to realize that he was also making an idiotic face like his soul had come out out of him.</p>



<p>“As for the answer… looks like you can’t give one immediately, huh.”</p>



<p>“Wh… Why…”</p>



<p>“I mean I just can’t help it. The reason is… I can’t explain it well, but… because I thought you were a good person.”</p>



<p>“It’s such a light…”</p>



<p>“It’s not like it was light, you know? It’s my first time confessing to a guy, and I needed a lot of courage. And so, how do you feel about getting my first kiss and confession?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;H-How?”</p>



<p>“Wasn’t it a bit sweet? Earlier I secretly applied a sweet flavored lip balm, and so I think it was probably sweet.”</p>



<p>“It was slightly sweet, but…”</p>



<p>“Fufufu, then I’m glad. It’s just awful if I got thought of as stinking in my first kiss.”</p>



<p>“That’s not the prob… Yuizaki… umm…” Falteringly, Sandai was trying to put out words, only for Shino to get a little miffed and pull his cheeks.</p>



<p>“Call me Shino, not Yuizaki.”</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/k44qfNH/uywgkhh.jpg" alt="uywgkhh" border="0"></a>


<p>“It-It hurh…”</p>



<p>“Say – it.”</p>



<p>“I-I goht it. I goht it… H-Hino.”</p>



<p>“Now all good.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“&#8230;You don’t have to think too hard about it. I just wanted to convey my feelings, and of course I’ll be happy if you like me, but I also intend to just give up if you don’t. Probably… I will cry a lot, but I don’t want to become a high-maintenance woman so I’ll come to terms with it,” Shino said with a smile, her lips quivering slightly. It was completely obvious that she was enduring and holding back her uneasiness.</p>



<p>Although it is something that Sandai as the one on the receiving end of the confession doesn’t understand, the act of confession is something that scares one to the point of cruelty. Approval, rejection, postponing, ignoring… it doesn’t matter which; after all, there will always be a result one way or another.</p>



<p>Neither can it stay in limbo, nor can you guarantee that you’ll get the answer you want. You’ll be left only to feel scared and scared.</p>



<p>That is why it is often said; that confession requires courage.</p>



<p>Sandai didn’t remember much from this point forward. They headed back to the apartment and did their original goal of confectionery making, but his consciousness was blurred.</p>



<p>He couldn’t tell the taste of the confections even when eating it, nor did the conversation that Shino and Miki were having at a hearable distance from him enter his ears.</p>



<p><em>“&#8230;Miki was surprised, y’know?”</em></p>



<p><em>“About what?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Well, to think you even went for confession.”</em></p>



<p><em>“What are you saying? Weren’t you the one who said momentum was important, Miki?”</em></p>



<p><em>“That’s about the kiss, Miki’s not saying it’s about confession…”</em></p>



<p><em>“&#8230;Eh?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Look there, Onii-chan is going blank. He’s like a broken robot. It’s not weird now even if there’s a sound effect like ‘beep boop boop bop’ or something like that, you know? You’ve gotta think about Onii-chan’s capacity.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Could it be that… I’ve done it…?”</em></p>



<p><em>“Miki didn’t think your head’s gonna be this slow, Onee-chan.”</em></p>



<p><em>“S-Shut up! It-It all looks good! Going blank just means he’s conscious of it… probably.”</em></p>



<p><em>“This is why no experience in romance is frightening…”</em></p>



<p>Sandai’s gaze was locked on Shino’s lips. He would remember the feeling of the kiss everytime those lips moved, and then his head would blank out again.</p>



<p>“Onii-chan, see you later~.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yeah.”</p>



<p>“See you later, Sandai.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Yeah.”</p>



<p>Although unsteadily, Sandai saw Shino and Miki off at the station, and then sat down on the bench on the platform after the train they’d boarded was out of sight.</p>



<p>He softly touched his lips with his middle finger, and his body temperature suddenly shot up; even the beating of his heart could so clearly be heard.</p>



<p>“What’s this development…? What the hell?” feeling strangely uneasy and bittersweet, Sandai writhed and yelled. Passersby were startled and turned to look at him, but he didn’t have the leisure to mind that.</p>



<p>“Like… Kiss… She… She said she likes me…”</p>



<p>Shino had certainly said so; not in the sense of liking him as a friend or a person, but as the member of the opposite sex.</p>



<p>The face, the expression of Shino when they’d kissed would come and go inside his head. As it repeated over and over again, it became etched into the back of his mind and wouldn’t leave.</p>



<p><em>I’ve got to calm down somehow</em>—immediately after returning to his apartment, Sandai tried to distract his mind by studying without taking a single break, or by binge watching late-night anime.</p>



<p>Though, none of those worked, and his mind remained unsettled.</p>



<p>With his exaltation still not calming down, Sandai slipped into his bed. Then, finally, he realized that Shino had sent him just one message.</p>


<p>*Sandai, I’ll stop contacting you until you can give the answer, okay? ‘Cause I’ll look like I’m rushing you, and I feel bad.*</p>



<p>Shino told him that she’d give him the time to think alone. This was a very appreciated thoughtfulness, and Sandai patted his chest down in relief.</p>



<p>However, even if they stopped exchanging messages, there would still be the physical closeness of distance due to their back-to-back seating relationship at school on weekdays. Willing or not, they would be aware of each other’s presence.</p>



<p>Not sure what kind of face he should make, Sandai thoroughly avoided Shino at school.</p>



<p>It turned into a blatant avoidance without any holding back even from the viewpoint of an onlooker, but it never did become a problem, nor was there another student catching interest.</p>



<p>After all, there was the accumulation of the agreement of ‘not getting involved with each other at school’ from before that had been kept ongoing, so it was not at all unnatural even if Sandai was strangely avoiding Shino.</p>



<p>Then days passed.</p>



<p>Sandai was still unable to give a clear answer, but with the passage of time, he was gradually regaining his calmness and gaining a bit of leeway to think.</p>



<p><em>…Can I keep on not giving an answer forever and wait until we both forget about it, making the confession never happen?</em> thought Sandai as he gazed out the window, but he also immediately realized that this thought was too insincere.</p>



<p>Shino had told him during the confession; that she would just give up if he didn’t like her, and that she didn’t want to become a high-maintenance woman so she would come to terms with it as well.</p>



<p>No matter what form it would take, Shino wished for a clear answer. And yet, aiming for it to die out in course of time was proof that he wasn’t facing Shino’s feelings.</p>



<p><em>I…</em></p>



<p>Suddenly, the face of Shino sitting behind him was reflected on the window. Shino was tightly biting her lower lip and hanging her head down without confidence.</p>



<p>The longer he delayed the answer, the more painful it would be for Shino. It was an expression that made him understand that even if he didn’t want to.</p>



<p><em>I don’t want to see a sad face like that, your smiling face is what I</em>—</p>



<p>Sandai suddenly realized.</p>



<p>He realized that his answer had already been inside him.</p>



<p>Or rather, there was no need to agonize over it to begin with, he had already decided on the answer from the beginning.</p>



<p>However, he was scared to admit it.</p>



<p>He didn’t have the courage.</p>



<p>He was a loner, so he was bad at making a decision that would bring about a big change, making him fall into the habit of trying to run away and keep it closed under a lid.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’m such a total jerk, huh.” Sandai made a bitter smile in such self mocking, and began to use his phone under the desk so the teacher couldn’t see it.</p>



<p>He would just have to muster up the courage like Shino had mustered up hers, do what he could, give all he could.</p>



<p>His loner self wasn’t sure how far he could go with a lover, but he had come to an acceptance that there was no need to be cowardly anymore.</p>



<p>No longer intending to play games, the violent beating of Sandai’s chest reached Shino through the radio wave.</p>



<p>Reflected on the window, Shino picked up her phone while puzzlingly tilted her head, and opened her eyes wide as soon as she looked down at the screen.</p>



<p>Afterwards, Shino gradually broke into a smile—and finally into a radiant smile.</p>



<p>On the last third of September at the beginning of fall in his second year of high school, Fujiwara Sandai, a mere loner, developed into a loner with a girlfriend.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6</strong></p>



<p>The season also began to truly turn into fall. The uniform was changed as well starting October, switching from summer to winter uniform.</p>



<p>On such a day after school, Sandai suddenly passed by Nakaoka and was stopped by her. Nakaoka looked hard at Sandai from the top of his head to his toe as if observing and said, “You have… changed somehow lately, huh?”</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“How should I put it, it’s like you seem composed, calm, something like that… Could it be that you?”</p>



<p>He was continuing to keep his relationship with Shino hidden at school, but having been observing him occasionally, Nakaoka seemed to have noticed.</p>



<p>“I would say it’s… as you guessed.”</p>



<p>“I see, so that’s why you seem different! When I gave you some advice, you were just refuting this, refuting that, so I was thinking you might be no good, but… looks like it’s gone in the good direction, huh.”</p>



<p>“Somehow, well, you know,” Sandai said and smiled wryly.</p>



<p>“Go enjoy your youth, youngster. Studying should be taken seriously as well as part of a student’s duty, but it’s also okay to turn your attention to something else for a bit. However, just make sure you use contraception, you hear?”</p>



<p>“Co-Contraception…?”</p>



<p>It’d been two weeks since they’d started dating. Their relationship was deepening to a degree, and even he was able to willingly give a kiss now, albeit awkwardly.</p>



<p>However, those were just in the category of a wholesome relationship. It still wasn’t the time to think about beyond that point.</p>



<p>Sandai couldn’t help but blush.</p>



<p>“What’s with that face… are you telling me you’re still a virgin?”</p>



<p>“I-Is it bad? Is it bad to be a virgin?”</p>



<p>“You still have it?”</p>



<p>“I still have it!”</p>



<p>“Then you normally wouldn’t be able to put up with it.”</p>



<p>“What do you think male high school students are?”</p>



<p>“Sexual drive monster.”</p>



<p>“That’s just a bias!”</p>



<p>“Nah, it mustn&#8217;t be a bias but a fact. Even at the staff meeting this morning, the student counselor was talking about finding a student watching a porn video on his phone and confiscating it yesterday.”</p>



<p>“Tha-That’s just a part of the students, so…”</p>



<p>“Then have you never bought porn books or watched porn videos?” Nakaoka looked at Sandai suspiciously while stroking her chin.</p>



<p>While knitting his brows, Sandai looked away at the question that would be very hard to answer that would make a lie sound like a lie if he were to lie and say, ‘No, I haven’t.’</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’ve gotten rid of them. The physical goods.”</p>



<p>“The physical goods? The way you put it sounds like you have something other than physical goods, huh? Ooh?”</p>



<p>“&#8230;Please stop it already, spare me from that kind of talk. It’s plain embarrassing, and it’s just not something a teacher should be talking about to a student.”</p>



<p>“Nah, it’s something a teacher should be talking about to their students. Regarding such sexual issues, for example, the regulations don’t directly prohibit sexual relations between fellow high school students, but it is also a healthy desire of youngsters to have romantic feelings for the opposite sex of the same age and to desire their body. However, the deeds, although obvious, come with a responsibility. As a teacher, I have to remind you. I’m not telling you not to do it. I’m just saying be responsible. Don’t become the kind of trash who knocks someone up because they prioritize feeling good and don’t take any measure, alright?”</p>



<p>“I’m… satisfied even if I don’t have sex, so…”</p>



<p>Although it didn’t mean that Sandai was not interested in physical relations, simply kissing and holding hands were enough to satisfy him.</p>



<p>However, Nakaoka dismissed Sandai’s state as ‘just for now.’</p>



<p>“&#8230;Sooner or later that won&#8217;t satisfy you. Besides, there’s also the possibility of Yuizaki wanting what comes after the kiss. Heart and physical connection go hand in hand. There are people who regard platonic relationships as important, but it depends largely on each individual, such as due to religious beliefs, or mental instability like being too fastidious. Otherwise, physical relations stand as the highest level of expression of love and act of validation… I guess I’m nagging too much, huh. What I want to say in the end is that, go think of your partner.”</p>



<p>“&#8230;”</p>



<p>“By the way, make sure you put on a condom, you hear? Don’t go saying things like you don’t use it because you don’t know where it’s sold, alright? It’s usually sold in a drugstore and the like, so go look for it.”</p>



<p>Sandai knew Nakaoka was talking about serious stuff, but it wasn’t any immediate matter anyway and was just embarrassing, so he turned his back on her.</p>



<p>“Don’t be so cold like that… Well, I’ll tell you just one last thing.” Hearing that would be the last one, Sandai turned around without thinking. “Don’t buy condoms at a place that might sell adult toys, alright? I hear places like that also sell ones specifically made to break immediately. If you accidentally buy stuff like that… you’re gonna be a papa at that age, you know?”</p>



<p><em>I wish I never turned around</em>, Sandai left the school behind along with such regret.</p>



<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7</strong></p>



<p>There wasn’t much change in Sandai’s activities after returning home compared to before. However, there was just one component added that was different from before.</p>



<p>“&#8230;About time, huh.” Having checked the hands on the clock to confirm the time, Sandai tidied up his studying tools and checked his phone. And then he received a message from Shino.</p>


<p>*I’ll be there soon so wait for me~.*</p>



<p>Speaking of a component different from before, Shino would now come to Sandai’s apartment every night after her part-time job was over.</p>



<p>Shino had switched from taking the 21:00 train she had previously been taking to the one an hour later to allow that extra hour to be used for boyfriend-girlfriend time.</p>



<p>They were hiding their relationship at school, and if they were to exclude days-off, this one hour would be the only time they would have as lovers during weekdays. It was a precious one hour.</p>



<p>Sandai was waiting in seiza at the entrance when the doorbell rang. It was Shino. Sandai nervously headed for the front door.</p>



<p>“Yoo-hoo!”</p>



<p>“Been waiting for you here.”</p>



<p>“I was impatiently waiting, too! Yah!” Sandai hugged Shino tightly as she came jumping at him, and he went inside with her in princess carry. “&#8230;Kiss me,” Shino said at the entrance, and Sandai slowly put his lips on hers despite feeling bashful.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was still awkward. Nevertheless, he put his feelings into it to convey it to her.</p>



<p>Shino’s lips tasted like fresh citrus. It was a flavor a little different from usual, but Shino would change her lip balm from time to time, so that was the reason.</p>



<p>“Did you notice the flavor change?”</p>



<p>“Nn… Mandarin?”</p>



<p>“That’s right. The last one was strawberry and the one before was vanilla, but which one you like? I’m trying to see what kind you like, Sandai.”</p>



<p>“You can just use what you like, Shino.”</p>



<p>“I do want to like the flavor my boyfriend likes!”</p>



<p>“I also want to like the flavor you like, but… if I say this, looks like we won’t be on the same page no matter how much time passes, huh. Then I guess I’ll have you put on a lip balm that matches mine. Strawberry.”</p>



<p>The strawberry had a flavor and smell that was like giving the actual feeling of kissing one, and Sandai kind of liked that.</p>



<p>“Okay!!” Shino said with a smile, and began to fish through her pouch, apparently already going to reapply it.</p>
