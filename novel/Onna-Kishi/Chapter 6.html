<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Behind the Scenes of Archfiend Subjugation</h3>

<p class="calibre6">The breeze felt warm between the buildings. The season of the year is about to change from spring to summer. The days are long at this time of year and the sky is still light, but the white moon has already risen high in the sky and streets of Mysia are beginning to show the bustle of the night.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Mysia is a big town, and the waves of people never stop flowing even at night. The stores are lit up with lights, and the stalls are transformed from stores selling travel gears and daily necessities to stores selling foods and drinks. The streets are filled with vendors and touts calling out to passerbys, and near the fountain in the square, many friends and lovers can be seen waiting for each other. Miliazar walks alone, away from the hustle and bustle, while squinting at the scene that could be a symbol of the peaceful Midlands.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「People still live the same way they have for hundreds of years… but there are certainly more smiling faces than there were during the war.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar was suddenly reminded of the past. When the founding body of the Arnelia religion had not yet been established, and she was traveling around the country like a pilgrim, the living area of humans was a very small part of this continent. People were so frightened by the existence of fiends that they could not travel or emigrate, and it was not uncommon for villages and towns to be attacked and destroyed by packs of fiends. The population may have been less than 1/10 of what it is today.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In addition, there were many more Archfiends than there are now. Among them, there were six extremely powerful Archfiends who were capable of swallowing entire nations. These powerful Archfiends were called.『Great Archfiends』, and the war against them lasted for 300 years, and the time when the series of wars continued was called the Great War Period. The Great War Period ended about 350 years ago. Since then, there have been many wars and conflicts between humans, and the period up to the current peacekeeping system in each country is called the Dawn Period. The Dawn Period ended about 20 years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Milizar began her pilgrimage before the start of the Great War. No, there is no doubt that her very existence was a factor in causing the Great War. As she traveled from place to place, she was naturally involved in defeating fiends, and many people began to work for her, and by the time ten years had passed, she had become a major force. As a result, the force led by Miliazar became one of the banners for the rebellion against the Archfiends. This was the organization that became the foundation of Arnelian religion.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Of course, it shouldn’t be forgotten that at the same time there were many other legendary heroes who led their people against the Archfiends. The Arnelian religion, which could move without being bound by national borders, was much easier to move the country, although it was not flexible as them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In any case, Miliazar helped the sick and injured, enabled villages and towns to keep in touch with each other, and made it possible for people to come and go safely. She also created the land of fiends and expanded the range of life for humans. At some point, she came to be called a saint or a supreme teacher. Recovery magic was originally taught by her to those who had the background to help others more efficiently, but as a result many people developed the abilities of sisters, priests, and priestesses, and humans became much less likely to die than before. In the midst of this, many of her subordinates swore to give their lives to her and followed her, dead or alive. This is how the Arnelian religion was created.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Their dedication and many sacrifices have made Arnelia what it is today. Nowadays, most of Arnelia’s activities are to help people in need, but in the past, the main content was to defeat fiends. They devoted a lot of energy to defeating the Great Archfiends. Many people were sacrificed, but even more people benefitted. It’s not that she’s proud of ber accomplishments by weighing the lives of humans on a scale, and it’s not that fighting was her goal, but she have never felt regret for what she have done. She believes that any regret would be an insult to those stake their dreams, hopes and even their lives on what she had done. However…</p>


<p class="calibre6">「I’ll never know if I did the right thing or not…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As the power of the fiends faded and the range of human life expanded, humans began to fight among themselves. The Arnelian Church, led by Miliazar, basically remained neutral in the war between humans, but because of the lack of cooperation with the other countries to defeat the fiends, the Arnelian Church continued to defeat the fiends alone for a long time. In the process, many knights, sisters and monks died. There were many times when the church was criticized for this and an internal split almost occurred.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There were also many who took advantage of the expanding power of the church to do evil. This is in spite of the fact that the group is based on the principles of charity and salvation. When she first entered the Arnelian Church, she did not have such evil intentions, and she was sure that most of them were working hard with noble ideals. Having dealt with internal conflicts with her own hands at times, Miliazar had always been haunted by grief. But she was not one to cut corners or show half-hearted mercy, that was for sure.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As the Arnelian religion has grown, there is no denying that it has become filled with darkness. Miliazar smiled to herself. That’s probably because she was that kind of person. The group she created was like her own children. Children take after their parents.</p>
<p class="calibre6">While Miliazar was lost in thought, the downtown area had already been cut off and she was entering a dark back alley. This is one of the most unsafe streets in Mysia, lined with brothels, gambling dens, and black markets. The street are lined with scantily clad prostitutes and ruffians with bad eyesights, snatching wallets from drunken people lying in the street, and the shouts of fights coming from the narrow alleys. At dawn, it is not uncommon to find a dead body lying on the street.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But nowadays, this kind of scene can be seen in any town. It’s not as bad as the famous back streets of Tarlam, but Miliazar can’t help but feel a pang in her chest at the sight of such a scene.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I didn’t mean to save these people. They work hard every day, they try their best to live, and yet they lose their lives over trivial things. I just didn’t want to overlook such events. But I can’t choose who I save…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She remembered the villagers who had been good to her in the past. They worked hard to survive, never complained about working late every day, and even though they were not wealthy, they never abandoned those in need. And yet, with just one attack by a pack of fiends, everything was reduced to ashes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The old couple who invited her to their home for dinner, the big family whom she sowed seeds, and her best friends, the twins who ran the fields and mountains with her, were all gone. Also gone with the sisters who always spoke to me. At that moment, something grabbed the hem of her clothes. It was dirty man, probably some kind of beggar.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You’re a sister, right? I haven’t eaten anything for three days… please have mercy on me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Fine.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">She took out the sweets she had just bought from the stall. The shape was like a star, and she was looking forward on sneaking some later, but Miliazar thought that she would be disqualified from preaching the beliefs of the church if she was stingy with this.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「This is all I have at the moment, but…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Tch! What the hell? It’s just a candy bar! Are you mocking me because I’m lowly?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Unfortunately, it’s all I have.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Then give me the money! I’ll buy liquor with it. I can live on liquor.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Unfortunately, I don’t have any money either. I’d like to give it to you, but…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t fuck with me!」.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The man grabbed Miliazar by the chest.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Let go of your hands. Anyone who harasses the Sisters of Arnelia will be punished accordingly.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Tch」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Maybe the man used to have a certain amount of faith, maybe he felt guilty about wreaking havoc on the young sister, or maybe Miliazar’s eyes were sharper than he thought. Either way, he withdrew more easily than she expected and disappeared into the alleyway, swearing. Of course, if she had tried to do anything more, Miliazar would nhave punished him first, before Heaven could punish him.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「He didn’t even work for himself, yet he was so dependent on others… typical of a bad person. In the past, people like that would have not survived. If you didn’t support each other, it was hard to even survive.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It can’t be helped,」she muttered to herself as she straightened her posture.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I just can’t bring myself to love them as much as you do to those people. I can’t help it, though I would help them it they were in trouble. But I’m sure you’d have no hesitation in showing your love to such people… Aren’t you, Arnelia…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She remembered the face of the sister who had picked her up a long time ago. It was so long ago that the description of her face is now only dim image. But she will never forget a single word she said to Miliazar.</p>

<p class="calibre6">&ndash;&ndash;Don’t hate them&ndash;&ndash;</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Arnelia, I’m no saint, and I’m not a worthy master. I’m just a imitation of you. I still hate the people who killed you, even to this day.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She took care of her, protecting her from being an outcast. She took care of her and persuaded the villagers to let her stay in the village. If she had a fever, Arnelia would stay awake and take care of Miliazar until she got well. If a villager was injured, she would fly to its house to help, and if there was no food in the house, she would give them food even if she had to cut down her own. The villagers were so moved by her kindness that they decided to do the same as Arnelia. In an age infested with fiends, there was no probably no village in the world at that time that was so peaceful. Whenever she think back on it, she feel a warmth welling up in her chest.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Such a scene… I wish could see it again.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">As she was lost in her reverie, she noticed that the street was empty. Even though they were deep in the backstreets, it was strange that no one was around.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hmm… They were probably around here somewhere, come on out.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">And then the shadows appearing, swooshing in and out. There were five in all, but they might still be lurking. Miliazar’s yawn tinkled.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’ve been waiting for you. Let’s ask you who you are.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’re not talking. That’s not very interesting…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Before Miliazar could finish, the first one gave the signal, and without a sound, the others began to move. All of them took out blades from their pockets.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So soon!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar fluttered left and right to avoid the approaching people. It should be difficult to move in a sister’s uniform, but the lightness of her body language is hard to believe for a sister. She grabbed one of them by the hand and slammed it into the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was a dull thud, as if a bone had been broken, but the person didn’t scream and quickly regained its position. It seemed to be a very well trained person to be able to repeat the attack despite the pain. But she’s not going to stop half-heartedly.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m sorry, but we’re going to keep you stuck for a while, okay?」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Miliazar was about to use a simple captivity spell when she realized that she couldn’t use magic.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What!?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Instantly, Miliazar jumped upwards to dodge something flying at her. She kicked the wall of tbe building and ran up to the roof of the building, which had four floors.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I see. To perform the exorcism magic and the blocking magic at the same time… The leading one, are you a jounin?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">In no time at all, the five of them came running up to the roof. A ninja is a person from another continent to the east, and is the name of an assassin. The continent to the east is only about the half the size of the continent they are currently on, but the fiends are stronger on average than the ones here, and there are many untouched lands, so therea are many opportunities to fight. In addition, the resources are scarce, so since the opening of diplomatic relations across the sea about 400 years ago, the country has been importing weapons amd human resources from the eastern continent in exchange of food and clothing from the western continent. One of those was the ninja.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The ninja, whose specialty is assassination, and who can also use magic (called fujutsu or ninjutsu), which has different system from that of this continent. It seems that they can also use direct offensive magic, but they mainly use magic with indirect effects in order to undertake clandestine work. This time, the magic of Miliazar has been sealed, and it is probably in that vein.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(It’s also nighttime, and the season is not conducive to sacred magic. I’m sure the effect will be short-lived, though, since it’s powerful enough to block my magic. I can’t even break the spell without knowing the strain. I’m sure I’ll be able to find something that works on you.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar looked for an opportunity to make a move, but as expected, the enemy gave her no chance. And before she knew it, each of them had something in their hands.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「(Is that… a sign? So it’s a summon or a shikigami.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">There were many more different types of techniques in the East than this continent, and they all used different styles to summon their servants. In some cases, the signs would grow and the servants would crawl out. Some would draw a kind of magic circle on the ground. some of the signs themselves transformed into servants. There are so many different kinds of summoning magic.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Youkai, shiki-oni, shiki-mushi… it’s quite a variety.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The number of servants summoned by rhe ninjas reached 20 in all. This could be a dangerous situation for Miliazar, who could not use magic. It was the first time the ninjas opened their mouths, as if they were quite sure of their advantage.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…Prepare yourself, Master Bishop-dono.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What, you can talk? But more importantly, if you know me as me, you know who you’re working for, don’t you?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The ninjas stopped moving for a moment as Miliazar spoke in a completely calm manner.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’re not talking again. Oh well. If you can provide us with information about your employer, we’ll double your current fee, how about that?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…Go」</p>

<p class="calibre6">But the ninjas showed no reaction and attacked.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You guys are really boring. I’ve given you a chance to live, why don’t you value your life?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar put her hands on her hips and sighed,『Good grief,』but in the meantime, the two-meter tall shiki-oni attacked her. But Miliazar dodged the fist and grabbed the face of the shiki-oni. Right after that&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre6">Gush!</p>

<p class="calibre6">With a bursting sound, Miliazar crushed the head of the shiki-oni, which was more than five time the size of her palm, as if she were crushing a palm-sized fruit. Brain plasma splattered around her, wnd flesh blood dripped from her hand.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Not only the monsters that were about to attack her, but the ninjas also gasped.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「It’s been years since I’ve killed anything, even a shiki-oni. Now, then. It seems that you’ve raised your hand to me, there’s no room negotiation. Besides, if I don’t fight once in a while, I’ll forget how to do it. I’m sorry, but you’re going to help me get used to the idea, risking your life, that is.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Surround her.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar’s face became more and more ready for battle. It seems that the ninjas, even though they were pushing themselves so hard, realized that their opponent was someone they couldn’t let their guard down for a minute. However, they had already made a mistake at this stage. At this point, they should have used all the shikigami as bait and fled, but they realized this 10 seconds late. Even if they had noticed, they don’t know if there would have been a chance to escape.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">&mdash;And then, thirty seconds later, there was Miliazar, strangling a ninja who seemed to be the leader of the group. Her figure, illuminated by the moon, was as beautiful as if she were not human. No, in fact, she did not look human. Her hair and eyes were the same color as before, but her mouth was split open near her ears, and her ears were pointed to the sky. Her arms and legs were covered in golden fur, and five richly thick tails sprouted from behind her. For some reason, though, only one of them was short.</p>
<p class="calibre6">And the ninja could no longer do anything to resist. Because its hand and feet had been torn off by Miliazar. Her surroundings had already turned into a sea of red, and she herself was dyed a deep red. Nevertheless, her expression remained the same as usual, and she spoke to the ninja rather calmly.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Why do you think I have lived for so long? Because I’m so strong, that no one was able to kill me. Those idiots of the Great Archfiends had a good match with me, but… well, I didn’t start out this strong, and I was lucky. And I’ve rarely gone into battle willingly. I’ve been assassinated more than once.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">A sound leaked from the ninja’s mouth. It seemed to be trying to say something.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hmm? What is it? If you have a will, I’d like to hear it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「… You …monster」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「How come you didn’t know about that? It’s too late for that now. In fact, I’m not even human.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Miliazar answers back, not seemingly depressed at all.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Now then, before you die, you’ll have to stay a little longer. I need to find out who hired you. It’s a dangerous magic that could destroy your brain if not done properly, but it doesn’t matter to you as you die. If I may say so, I’ll look up your name and remember it as well.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The ninjas’ bodies began to twitch and foam at the mouth. After about five seconds, the spasms turned more violent, and they stopped moving completely.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hmm… no useful information. I caught a few, but they were small fish. I guess I’m not good at fishing」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar seemed to have lost all interest in the assassins who had attacked her with an “ah-ha” look on their faces. She threw away the corpses of the ninja and lost herself in her own thoughts.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But this time the enemy seems to be stubborn. I’ll have to think of another way to find out who’s behind this. People never cease to fascinate me. I wonder why the power of the Master Bishop is so attractive. Or is it a challenge to me? Either way, it’s reckless.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She no longer remembered how many times Miliazar had her life threatened; she had counted about the thirtieth time, but she was not sure if it was five hundred years ago or even four hundred years ago when she quit counting because it became too much trouble. There were times when it was a hostile force, and times when it was a fiend. There was a time when it was her own belly. She had crushed all of them, and now here she was. She thought she had taken the least amount of sacrifice possible, but no matter what how well she thought she had done, sacrifices inevitably occurred. And she kept asking the same question every time.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「What would Arnelia do…? No, she’ll probably choose the option to not fight them.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The answer is always obvious. Arnelia would not fight her enemies, or even identify them as enemies. Miliazar was annoyed at the fact she was no longer able to imitate Arnelia, but there was no way she was going to give up the role she was playing now. It was obvious that if she were to leave, there would be further confusion over the vacant seat of power. No matter how much she thought about it, she couldn’t come up with a good answer, but she also knew that if she stopped thinking about, she would just become a monster. As Miliazar was lost in her lost thoughts, she suddenly heard the sound of water, or rather blood, behind her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…Kuchinashi, huh(Gardenia)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m sorry, I thought the soundproofing spell might wear off soon. I was wondering if you might ask me to come over.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, it’s alright.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The reply came from a female ninja dressed in blacl. Her face was hidden by a mask, so she couldn’t see her expression, but her voice was quiet and dignified. Her stature was about the same as that of an ordinary woman, but her body and gesture were lean and graceful. It was obvious that she was a very skilled person.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As it should be, she is the head of the assassination squad known as the『Silent Ones,』which is privately held by the head of church, Miliazar. Not even the Lazaar family knew their existence. She is the eyes and ears of the church head, who rarely leaves the church headquarters, and her main duty is to conduct espionage activities in various places, while some of the women take care of her personal affairs. Miliazar is not very good at dealing with a lot of messengers at the same time, so she had those people by her side for hundreds of years now. This time, the assassins were not even noticed by the jounin, and before they knew it, they had set up soundproofing magic. The fact that she lured the assassins to the rooftop was in accordance with her predetermined strategy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I apologize that you were only able to clean the mess.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ha.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「So, how many of you are in Mysia now?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Including myself, there are seven that can move immediately. Four in reserve. There are fourteen of us hiding in Mysia.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Miranda and the others will be back tomorrow evening. I’ll take a look at them and then return to Arnelia with Albert. There’s one thing I need to do. Leave the three of you with me just in case. I want the rest of you to find out what’s going on. Those in hiding can stay where they are.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「As you wish.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Kuchinashi thanked Miliazar for her prompt instructions.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m going back to the inn. If there is anything new to report, I’ll hear about it now.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, then. First of all, it seems that there was some kind of movement within the Western Olympus Church about a week ago. I’ll be able to give a concrete report in a day or two.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Olympus, that sounds like a lot of trouble. As soon as you get the report, wake me up, even if it’s at night. Anything else?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「The number of newly confirmed Archfiends in this continent has already exceeded seven in this past month. Up to five of them have been conquered, including those hunted by Lazaar-dono and company. The other two have yet to be confirmed, but we have just received a report that one of them may be from the Great Archfiend class. At the point where it appears, the countries of tbe Western Alliance are requesting for our assistance.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Will there be a war?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「High probability.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Kuchinashi’s starchy reply caused Miliazar to lower her eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「All right. I’ll use the people hiding in here to inform the churches of every district about the possibility of an expeditionary force. Tell them I’ll give them the details later. I’ll also send a messenger to the eastern continent. Depending on the situation, I’ll go there myself.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「As you wish.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I think I’ll contact the Church of Magic just in case… well, I’m sure they already know.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Can I get you anything else?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「All right, go… Oh, yeah. I missed a snakc earlier. Go to any candy store around herr and buy something suitable and bring it to my bedroom.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Sweets at night will make you fat and give you cavities. Brush your teeth before you go to bed, Miliazar-sama.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Leave that alone! It’s not here anymore!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Kuchinashi disappeared without the sound of footsteps. The other kunoichi took her place and began to clean up the mess.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’ve been around Miranda and the Lazaar family for generations… am I a child?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar’s tastes and appearance are those of a child, but… Regardless, when she returned to her room, somewhat pouting, there was already some candy on the table. The woman’s work was very quick.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Cotton candy?! I thought it was just candy. I mean, I told you I don’t eat cotton candy…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The first generation Kuchinashi, who knew the exact details, would never have done such a thing. Miliazar’s face darkened for a moment.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I kind of envy you, Miranda…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">A large amount of tears rolls down her cheek. But there is no one alive who knows the true meaning of her tears.</p>


<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">This was the forest where Alfiris and the others had fought the Archfiend.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Now, that the Archfiend was dead, there was nothing to threaten the original ecosystem here, and the attributes of the land should have returned to their normal state. However, the forest was supposed to be gradually filled with life, but there was no sign of it. Everything in the land was still quiet as if it were dead. Or perhaps one should say that everything with life hated this place.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Those with better instincts and more practiced magic would have noticed that the warding of the land had not yet disappeared. No, it was only in this place that the wards were newly put up. Or did the wards appear because of the introduction of those people? At any rate, anyone who saw it would have said that they didn’t want to be in such a place for even a moment. This place was filled with sinister and evil things that could not be compared to the previous archfiend. And even though there was no wind, the trees, grass, and everything else in this place was beginning to rustle&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Did you see that?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yeah.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s quite a twist on the Archfiend.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「And we’ve still got time.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What a waste. I had in mind for it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「He was just a newborn level one, after all.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Was that your favorite…?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I mean, it was good looking, wasn’t it?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Wasn’t that bad taste?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But… it would have been fun… to have it in town.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m with you on that.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It would have been delightful sight.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Be quiet…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The trees had been rustling ceased to rustle.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「We’ll maintain the status quo for a little while longer. Do you have a plan?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, sir.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I got it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ve found some good materials.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Can we really leave the female swordsman alone…?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Not now. We need to wait.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Alright, sir~」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Some of them haven’t been here yet… are you sure?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Leave them. As long as you do what you have to do, you’re fine.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If you don’t,『I’ll have to chastise you!』What do you think? Was it good enough?」</p>
