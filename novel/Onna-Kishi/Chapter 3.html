<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Master Bishop's Request</h3>

<p class="calibre6">「Haah… Haah… Haah…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「In the meantime, I’m going to show up at the church here in town! Alfie, get your stuff and head to the inn.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Sister Anorn ran off quickly as she could. It was vague to guess what kind of physical strength she has, but even Alfiris, who is physically strong enough to run around three mountains, is quite exhausted.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Incidentally, this is the west gate of the town of Mysia. It had been three hours ago, but after Alfiris had told her about the Curse Marks, she came back to do her own business and found Anorn standing there, screaming something and turning pale. When Alfiris called out to her, a bloodshot-eyed sister dragged her onto a horse, and they rode along the road at an absurd pace until now. It felt like a miracle that they didn’t run over anyone on the way.</p>
<p class="calibre6">On the way, she felt most sorry for them because they were flying so fast that the horses looked at her as if it wanted help, but it wasn’t in the mood to say anything like a break in front of Anorn’s demon-like form.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I’m sorry, Mr. Horse… after this I’ll give you lots of tasty fodder later…)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">And in her mind, Alfiris excused herself and said,「I have come this far.」The horses, too, thought that if they stopped, Sister might kill them, so they struggled to keep running despite the reckless pace.</p>
<p class="calibre6">This seemed to have finally pushed the horse beyond its limits, and it lied down and refused to move, despite the traffic in this place. Alfiris was dying out of embarrassment, but she managed to wake up her horse, gave it some water, and then looked for the innkeeper that Bis, the gate guard, had introduced him to.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「This city is huge…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris finally calmed down and looked around, but the walls for entering this city were high and the number of guards the city employed was on par to a small army. Despite what people may have heard, the city of Mysia is one of the ten largest cities on the continent where Alfiris is currently located. The main roads to the north don’t meet, but the main roads to the east and south connect to this city, and there are many people passing through. The population is over 800,000, is what Alfiris had heard. No wonder it is said to be the largest and safest of the three roads leading from the eastern group of states.</p>
<p class="calibre6">If the Kingdom of Fulgund, the nation to which Mysia belongs, were a more active trading nation, it would be no surprise if it were even more prosperous. Unfortunately, Fulgund is not focused on commerce, and the development of Mysia is not as good as it could be. Still, Mysia was the largest city that Alfiris had ever seen. Alfiris can’t help but let out a cheer appropriate to her age at the goods lined up in the street stalls of the city.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Whoa, so pretty.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Gems, food, and fiber products brought in from the Southern group of nations. The colorful foods are captivating Alfiris. It would take her three days just to look around the stores on this street. There are at least four more streets like this one, and Mysia is definitely a big city.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ahh, not good. I’ll have to slow the horse down for now.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was left reeling, but decided to leave the stalls for later. As she was walking around looking for an inn, she was suddenly approached from behind.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Are you looking for a place to stay, young lady? I’ll give you a discount. Fifty pents a night with a stable! What do you say?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It was a cheerful young beastman who approached her. Beastmen were thought to be creatures somewhere between man and beast, but now they are considered to be a completely independent species. Their appearance is close to that of humans, but they have deep fur, and many of them have tails or wings, depending on their race. They mainly form states in the South, but she guessed beastmen are not so uncommon here in Mysia, where the roads from the South converge.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris also saw very few beastmen in her travels. In some places, discrimination was deeply rooted. Alfiris was not particularly discriminating, but it was difficult to say whether she could trust that person. There was no need to go out of one’s way to follow a beastman.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m sorry, but I already got a place to stay. What’s more, you’re a beastman, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh? Are beastman rare to you, young lady? I am half-breed by the way.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see.」 It seems that Alfiris’ impression that he look even more like a human than a beast was correct. Without the ears and tail, he would be more like a slightly hairy human.</p>
<p class="calibre6">「They don’t look very beastly, do they? I’ve seen a few in my travels but I’ve never seen one in the streets. I’m from the countryside.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, well. These big cities are great but the less developed commercial areas are very prejudiced and dangerous for us. We’ve only been in here and Beetim in the South.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m sorry if I offended you, I didn’t mean it in a deep way. I was just a little surprised that the first person I’ve talked to in this city was a beastman.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, if you’re looking around so much, it sure looks like you’ve just arrived here. But you’re a kind person who can honestly apologize to us beastmen. I’ll tell you the location of the inn you’re looking for.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The young beastman, was kind enough to show her where the inn was. Normally, Alfiris would have not accepted such an offer, but she had a feeling that she could trust this young beastman, so she decided to discuss it with him. Alfiris’ lack of confidence in her sense of direction made it impossible for her to find an inn on her own, even after dark. She showed him the map she had received from Bis, the gate guard.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「This is the place, if you know what I mean?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If you’re looking for a place to stay, I’m your man there. Let’s see… Yeah, it’s two streets down on the right, and the third street on the left. It’s a quiet street, but there are a lot of innkeepers. I believe that place had a red sign with a shovel mark.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I understand now. Thank you very much.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You’re more than welcome to come to my place for dinner, by the way! We’ve got all kinds of Southern food, so come on by if you’re in the mood! Look for the green bubbly sign!”」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yeah, I’ll talk to my friend about it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris reciprocate with a smile and left the place. The young beastman was still smiling and waving at Alfiris. It was a very friendly beastman. Alfiris was glad that the first person she met in this city was someone like that, because of it, she was in a good mood.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In this era, beastmen are still an object of discrimination. This is because for a long time, there has been no unified state among beastmen, and because there are many races that determine hierarchy by power, there are many beastmen who sided with the archfiend rather than with humans. In addition, due to the high fighting power of the beastmen, the human side had been often burned by them on the battlefield, and rather than deepening their friendship, they had become an object of hostility. As a result, they were regarded purely as non-negotiable fiends, such as orcs and goblins, and became a target of persecution as demihumans.</p>
<p class="calibre6">However, about 100 years ago, a unified nation appeared on the beast side. Strictly speaking, there were several of them, but the largest of them, Gruzald, suddenly declared that it would not turn against humans. I response to this, there were those on human side who wanted to deepen their relationship with Gruzald, and that is how the current exchange came about. However, the old prejudice against beastmen still remains in the rural areas, not to mention in the big cities. But, such prejudice is irrelevant to Alfiris, who can interact with pure fiends.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, Alfiris arrived safely to her destination. She told Bis’ son what had happened and he thanked Alfiris thickly and indeed arranged for her to stay for free. They also serve meals except for lunch. That was very thoughtful of them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Sister Anorn told her to wait for her at the inn, but it would be cruel to ask her to wait if it was her first time to see such a prosperous metropolis in front of her; so she decided to go out, leaving a word in case Anorn should be mistaken for the innkeeper’s receptionist. And then…</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Wow, this sword is good!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh. Your eyes were like an expert, young miss!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">So, the first thing that Alfiris did is to go to the weapon shop, which is not very appealing story.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">But as expected, looking only at swords is boring, so Alfiris goes outside to check out the beautiful jewelry store she just saw.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Ara?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">At that moment, a pair of people walking down the street caught her eye. It was strange to see many people on the street.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The little sister was dressed the same as Sister Anorn, and probably belonged to the same church. Like Anorn, she has shoulder-length golden hair and large, round green eyes. She was probably ten years old. But she can only guess. Alfiris couldn’t express it well, but the aura she wore was different from that of a normal person. There was something about the way she looked that left her feeling uncomfortable, she thought.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The knight, on the other hand, has the same golden and green eyes. He’s not a big guy, but he’s probably one of the tallest boys in the world. He wears no armor and is dressed for travel, but he carries a large sword on his back that is tall as the sister, clearly giving off an extraordinary atmosphere.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「He looks very capable… I wonder if he’s stronger than me?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">There is big contrast between the neat, graceful, and kind face of a man and the sharp atmosphere he wears as a warrior. He was not that big of a man, but his body must have been covered with well-trained muscles. This man also looked strange from the first impression.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(They’re coming straight at me?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The strange yet atmospheric duo walked straight towards Alfiris as if there were no crowd. Rather than weaving through the crowd, it was as if people were giving way to them. When they came right in front of Alfiris, the little sister gave her a very loving smile.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Nice to meet you. Are you Alfiris-sama, right?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The little sister greeted Alfiris with a very polite and graceful gesture. Alfiris fumbled to reply to the unfamiliar and polite greeting.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ehh, yes. That’s me. And you are?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Please forgive me for not giving my introduction. I am Sister Millie, and I belong to the Church of Arnelia. Behind me is Albert Fidelity Lazar, a Templar Knight. I’m sorry for the inconvenience.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The knight behind her also made a brief but polite bow with his hand on his chest.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「How do you know about me?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「We have been contacted by Sister Anorn. She and I are to meet here in Mysia on an urgent matter. If she is not with you, has she gone to the church?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yeah, it should be, but…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I see, so it was a misunderstanding. If that’s the case, I’ll be heading to the church now, but what about you, Alfiris?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I think I’ll go to the church too, not because I don’t hate going there. Oh, and the『-sama』kinda tickles me, so please call me as you normally would.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Then, Alfiris. You may call me Millie. If you don’t mind, I’d like to go there together, can you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Of course.」</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/fqYDKbt/0097.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="calibre6">With a smile, Sister Millie smiled at Alfiris and began walking ahead of her, guiding her. The templar knight, Albert, urges her to go ahead with his eyes. Having no choice, Alfiris starts walking alongside Millie.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(This knight looks so seamless.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She could see that the knight who started walking behind her was wary of his surroundings. Anyone who approached with ill intentions within 10 meter radius would be probably be cut down without blinking an eye. The same would surely be true if Alfiris tried to do anything to this sister.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I don’t feel bad about this… It’s just that I didn’t know there was such a thing as perimeter security.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">If the opportunity arises, she would like to ask the knight walking behind her for a handfasting, and if she does, she wondered what will happen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Fufu, are you worried about Albert?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Oh, I’m sorry. I just thought he was an amazingly skilled knight.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Alfiris is also a sword user, aren’t you? Certainly, there aren’t many as skilled as Albert in the Temple Order.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s right. At least, he’s probably the best knight I’ve ever seen.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, is that so?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Millie is smiling brightly. She might be important to the church because such a knight is protecting her. After that, Alfiris is surprised by the intelligence of this girl as they continue to have an unconventional conversation. Her language is mature, which is understandable because of her upbringing, but she knows a lot about city and state affairs, commerical distribution, jewelry lined up in stalls, and even weird looking dolls that don’t seem to matter.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Alfiris wondered if all the Sisters of Arnelia were like this, but she thought that they were very different from the Sister she knew.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Millie knows so much about many things.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m a pilgrim on a mission, just like Sister Anorn.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「(Anorn seemed to know a lot about alcohol, slangs, and other such things… I guess that’s the difference between humans. Hmm?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris turned to Millie to ask her about it,</p>

<p class="calibre6">「We’re here.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Millie said calmly. They found themselves just in front of the Arnelia Branch Church in Mysia.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Let’s go inside for now.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Millie walked in quickly, followed by Alfiris.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「There are sisters praying…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She opened the door and peeked inside. The setting sun was shining through the skylight, and without looking back at Alfiris and the others who opened the door, she saw a sister praying with all of her heart. In front of the statue of Arnelia, the founder of the church, she kneeled down, folder her hands, and prayed without moving a muscle while murmuring a words of prayer. The setting sun glittered off her pure white sister’s robe, and it was like looking at a famous painting.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As Alfiris and the others stood there as if they had lost track of time, the sisters seemed to have finished their prayers and stood up and turned to face them. Alfiris had no idea about prayers, but even to a layman’s eye, she was curious about a sister who prayed so devoutly. But when she looked back at her…</p>

<p class="calibre6">「A&ndash;, Anorn?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It was so far removed from her usual image that Alfiris let out an unintentional yelp as she had completely lost sight of the possibility. As if in response to Alfiris’ voice, Anorn stopped praying and turned around.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Oh, Alfie. You could have waited for me at the inn.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Onee-sama!!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Before Anorn could even react, Millie hugged her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Onee-sama! I’ve missed you so much since you haven’t contacted me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Eh? Ahh, M&ndash;Millie?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ugh! Did you already forgotten my face? I’ve been wanting to talk to you for a long time, you know? We have an urgent request from the church, so let’s rent a room in here first! Now then, Alfiris, if you’ll excuse for a moment, I’d like to borrow Sister Anorn. Albert, please do not be rude to Alfiris! I’ll see you later!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As soon as she said that, Millie pulled Anorn’s hand and disappeared behind the door. The omly people left behind were Alfiris and Albert.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「(……. I can’t wait on, what should I do?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The silence continued. It may have been an awful situation for Alfiris, who rarely has the chance to talk to with men.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Wai&mdash; Wait a second!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Millie is shuffling along, pulling Anorn’s hand.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Where the hell are we going!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m sure no one will come in that room.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Get your hands off me!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn strained to shake off her hand, but it showed no signs of budging at all.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(This girl…?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn’s arm strength was enough to blew away a big man. This time, she tried to shake it off with a lot of effort, but it was clamped down with the force of a vise.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Tsuu&mdash;」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn groans involuntarily at the sheer force.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;What arm strength is this. This is not the stuff of ordinary human.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn’s face turned pale.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As she was brought into the room to be thrown it. Millie finally let go of Anorn’s hand. And as Millie took one look at her, the key clicks behind her. And was tightly automatically locked.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Guh, who are you? I’m sure there’s no such thing as a Sister who would take a knight on a pilgrimage, Millie! I don’t think a young sister like you should be on this mission!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Then she heard a kind of creepy laugh… coming from a slightly slumped Millie.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s nice to finally meet you, isn’t it, Sister Anorn?」</p>


<p class="calibre6">The face of Sister Millie’s, who looked up, was smiling wickedly with the edge of her mouth hanging up in a grin, as if the lovely smile she had just shown was a lie.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So who are you, brat!?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You still don’t get it, do you?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As if the angelic expression on her face when she was smiling at Alfiris was a lie, Millie looked at Anorn with an evil, twisted expression in her mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I have no idea.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s me, ME.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What is that, some kind of a new scam?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Nah, it’s more like it’s been already used… That’s not it!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Millie is getting frustrated, and stomps the ground furiously.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Oh Lord, you really don’t know, do you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t know any little girls like you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Guh, I didn’t know that a brat like you can be this naive. It seems like you need to be chastised (spanked) to understand.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Chastised… I&mdash;Is that you Master Bishop!?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Does the image of me chastising you is that remarkable!?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Finally, Millie started to clomp on the ground. Anorn finds the gesture a bit cute.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I mean, I haven’t known. The last time I saw you, you looked like an old lady, right? Even your voice is different. Why are you dressed as a little girl again?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「There are many reasons for this. Anyway, what do you think? Doesn’t it look good on me?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She spun around and said,「Fufun~!」 And Millie looks good at it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s very convenient to go downtown with this appearance, you know?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「For example…?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s right, I went to a pastry store in the downtown area half an hour before the store closed and said, ‘Uncle, I’m here to visit you!’ If you manage to said it, you’ll have a chance of getting some extra sweets.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「W&ndash;What a miserable…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Last week I played kick the can with a bunch of orphans from downtown… It was really a good way to exercise!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Nah, considering about your age? Let me dare to say it. Old hag, don’t push yourself.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Is that all you need to say? A brat like you is old enough to know better than that!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m certain you’re not even halfway there yet. I don’t know what you’re talking about with your worn-out xxx.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m still good you know! You’re the one who’s always pouting in front of men, and you’re the one who’s a xxxx.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, you’re going to say that? I’m going to tell everyone about your xxxx, xxxx!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Try it! Do you want me to spread your embarrassing xxxx to the whole church through a decree?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’ve said it, you xxxx!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Come on, you xxxx!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">This unbearable argument would go on for a long time. The thought of Alfiris and Albert waiting outside had completely vanished from their minds.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Haah, haah, you power harassing superior!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Huu, huu, power must be abused. Show me a little respect as your superior.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">They argued with each other as hard as they could for 20 minutes. After 20 minutes of arguing with each other, both of them seemed exhausted their energy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Gonna break. I’m so really tired…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Millie sits down on a chair on the floor while exhaling. No, not Millie, but Master Bishop Miliazar, the Master Bishop of the Church of Arnelia, to be exact. She is the supreme authority of the Church of Arnelia, which has 187 churches, 974 related institutions, more than 30,000 temple knights, and knights affiliated to them, and more than 50,000 sisters and priests on this continent. The history of the Church spans 800 years, and it is said that no king of any country or leader of any city can escape its influence.</p>
<p class="calibre6">While they are forbidden to interfere in the politics of other countries, they put a lot of effort into conquering fiends and helping the poor, and in order to spread their influence, they can ask other countries to cooperate, sometimes even to stop a war, and ignoring the request for cooperation from the Church of Arnelia is a statement on intent that it will not need the Church’s help in any future situation. Therefore, the unspoken law in this world is that even if you don’t necessarily favor the Church, you have to cooperate with it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Gruzald, a nation of beastkin, was quick to cooperate with this stance, and several related establishments have already been built in Gruzald. The Master Bishop herself is rarely seen in public, living mostly in temple at the back of the Main Church. The only people who have seen her in person are the three archbishops, the elite guards who near to her, and the women who take care of her personal affairs. Anorn was the exception among them.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So, what can I do for you, Master? Since you’ve come all the way out here, it must be a very urgent matter, right?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn asked, returning to a slightly more serious mood.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s half work, half fun. I’m sure I’ll be bored without you at Headquarters. They’re too serious these days. And my bodyguard is a real stiff.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ve only caught a glimpse of your guard, but is that the most powerful Lazaar of all time?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s right. The name Lazaar is familiar to you, is it not?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar asked Anorn in a manner. Anorn answered with a frown.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s so nostalgic that it makes me want to puke.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t say that. I’m the only one here who can speak in equal terms to you. That was before your current assignment, over a hundred years ago.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That was such a bad time.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It was terrible for me too you know! It’s been five generations since Lazaar. He was the one who caged every single one of my attendants. I’ve never thought I’d have to replace all my attendants in three years.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I was almost carried off myself.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Bullshit! Every time he tried to seduce you, anyone could hear him scream. It was a tradition in the Church.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It was such a huge inconvenience for us, though. It’s amazing that he’s the most skilled in the Temple Order.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「He was one of the best in the history of the Order. The current Lazaar is the same. The other day, the three captains of the 2nd, 4th, and 7th squads were all put down together. He’s probably the strongest of all time. Also, there aren’t many people on the continent who are stronger than him purely in sword skills.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar is a bit proud of herself. The only person from the Lazar family that Anorn was directly involved with was someone five generations ago, so the mention of the Lazaar family naturally reminded him of that person.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(The first time I met him, he suddenly grabbed my ass and said, 『Hey beautiful girl!』 I’m sure no one will be happy to hear that. The next day, he said the same thing while grabbing my chest. He was the only person I’ve ever met who was that stubborn. And after telling that it’s only ME, he quickly married another woman… At that time, I was just annoyed at how random he was, even in though he was a very uptight guardian of the Church Law, but now even that was a fond memory. If I live forever, will I eventually be able to feel that all my memories are just nostalgia?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn’s recollection was interrupted by Miliazar’s words.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But thanks to him, you’ve regained your humanity. You should be grateful, right?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, he’s one of those men I’ll never forget. I’ll never forget him, that includes the way he died.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…So, what’s the deal?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh my. I’m too old for this. I’m getting distracted.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar straightened her posture and turned around. This time, her expression shows seriousness.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Let’s start with your current assignment.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">There was no longer any hint of mockery in Anorn’s voice. As a pilgrim on a mission, she listens respectfully to the words of the Master Bishop.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It has been more than 100 years since you came on your pilgrimage. The scope of our church has expanded and injustices have been corrected. In addition, the activities of fiends and wars between nations have become much less frequent. This is to your credit.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m thankful for such words.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Anorn hangs her head.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Taking your actions as an example, there are 78 sisters and monks and 354 temple knights who are currently on similar actions. I think it’s safe to say that the pilgrimage business is now on track. At this time, I am relieving you of your pilgrimage duties. It has been long a great cause.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, Master. So, what’s the next assignment?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Not so fast.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar cast her eyes down once.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m talking about the Archfiend that appeared this time. The appearance of the Archfiend itself is not that unusual, unlike the common knowledge known to the world, but the way it appears is quite unnatural… I didn’t want to send someone inept to face it. So I thought you might be the right person for the job.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Was the Archfiend’s appearance totally certain?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I just checked, and I’m sure of it. It’s in the woods, about seven days northwest of here.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No way! That’s too close to this city.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s also what I think.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「(There was no sign of anything, the emergence of an archfiend? More than that, this area has not had any major warfare in recent years, and the church has done a good job of purifying the area. It must be a very difficult place for fiends to live, and it must be a place where they can get rid of their poison. Former war zones and lands belonging to darkness are suitable places for fiends to grow. Since the discovery of such things hundred years ago, not only the church but also other countries have been woeking to purify the land. Places with large cities such as this one nearby have been especially cleansed. It could be said that they have become large cities because of the purification, but there should be no room for fiends that would become archfiends to grow. And yet…)」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Anorn’s thoughts whirled dizzily. But no matter what she thought, she couldn’t get an answer with the information she had.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Does Master think it was done by someone else?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t know. I’d like to ask you to investigate and take down such a thing, including who would benefit from doing so.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「At your command, Master. Then must I go there alone?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, bring Alfiris. I’ll lend you Albert as well.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「&mdash;! Master, are you planning to use Alfiris after knowing about her situation?!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t look fiercely at me… I’m not. It’s time for you to get over this, isn’t it? Neither Albert nor Alfiris will die easily.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But then…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn gave a puzzled look, unusually crisp for her. Miliazar rebuked Anorn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I didn’t expect that I’d thought you’d be making such a face. In fact, that’s why you should take Alfiris with you. If you want to be a true friend to her, you should definitely do so.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But Alfie is…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「The test for you is now, but the test for her will come much later. Perchance she will not be able to overcome it alone… I am convinced of that now that I have seen her face to face. She’s more than what you think, Anorn. Or should I call you Miranda, since we’re alone together?」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Anorn tried to argue, but the color in Miliazar’s eyes was that of compassion itself. Miliazar was genuinely worried about Anorn. She didn’t want to be called by her real name again, but she certainly didn’t want to keep lying to Alfiris. Anorn could tell her… or should tell her. She was beginning to think so.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「When Alfiris hits a wall, she will need the help of a true friend. Do you or do you not care what happens to the girl?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No… I mean, yes!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn answered clearly. Seeing her expression, Miliazar seemed satisfied.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hmm, so you will accept this request?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「As you command, Master.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn gets down on one knee and makes a formal bow.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Don’t be so formal with me. I think you’re one of the few friends I can talk to on equal terms. I don’t care if it’s official, just take it casually when we’re alone.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, now that you asked me. Then, let’s do it, old hag!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s too casual!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so they were back at the beginning of the argument.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">Meanwhile, Alfiris and Albert were waiting outside. While they were making so much noise inside, the two people outside were not talking at all.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ahh, umm, Mr. Lazaar?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Calling me Albert is fine.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「The&mdash; The weather is fine today, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, it is.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Were you from a knightly family, Mr. Albert?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You seem to be quite strong, do you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, it is.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「How could you affirm that so easily! Ah, I said it out loud…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「……Fuh」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「(Th&mdash;This guy is cool, but there’s something wrong with him!)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The conversation had become something that could be dodged at any lunchtime. The only person Alfiris usually hangs out with is the cuddly Anorn, so it’s hard to have a conversation with such a quiet type, let alone a man. It’s not uncommon for Alfiris to shed her tears when training, but the awkwardness of the situation was making her want to scream.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(T&mdash;This is would be easier if I did a thousand bare-knuckle fights… Anorn, hurry up and come back!)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">At that time&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Alfie, sorry for waiting.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Anorn~」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn showed up at such a good time, and Alfiris couldn’t help but sound like she was about to cry. Hearing this, she mistook it for something that Albert had done to Alfiris.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「You bastard, what have you done to my Alfie! This is why I don’t trust the people of Lazaar! You’re quite the dirty type, aren’t you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Onee-sama!! (Quiet down, you xxxx sister!)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">A catcalling voice with an undertone of “I’m sorry, I can’t help it,” came from behind Anorn. As she was about to take out her mace from the sleeve of her sister’s dress, stops dead.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As Miliazar’s hand grabbed Anorn with such force, Anorn could definitely hear the creaking of her bones.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well then, Sister. I have certainly informed you of the request. Albert, please accompany Sister Anorn as we discussed. I will return to the church headquarters after I finish my other business. Albert, may I?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, Ma’am.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert replied to Millie, as if he didn’t cared at all about Anorn who tried to hit him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Miliazar, who had changed her attitude into Millie, spoke to Alfiris and the others with a glowing expression.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’ll leave you to your busy schedule, but I’ll you about the reward for Alfiris. The reward will based on your performance, but if you ever are in Arnelia, where the headquarters is located, please come to me at any time. In the meantime, I will give you the expenses that are considered necessary first. You may receive them from Anorn.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Millie, who is in fact, Miliazar, was quick to give instructions and get the story going.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Now, if you’ll all excuse me. Alfiris?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ah, yes!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was suddenly called out, and unintentionally became like a student who was angered by the teacher.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Millie is kind of dignified… isn’t she?)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If you are in trouble, turn to the one next to you, he will help you. Please do not forget my words.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Eh, ah, yes!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">When Alfiris looked at her curiously, Millie smiled faintly amd left the place. The slightly sad smile on her face was quite remarkable to Alfiris.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The three remaining people looked at each other.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So… what do you want to do?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why don’t we go back to the inn?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Uh, Albert, is that right? What do you want to do?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ll follow your instructions. But if we are going to fulfill the request, we may need at least one more companion. We will need to be prepared.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「A companion, huh? I’m not sure if I can get by on my own, but if there’s someone I can use, I’ll try to recruit them. Ah, but it’s almost sunset… We’ll get weapons and food tomorrow. For now, why don’t we go to the guild for dinner as well? There will be a lot of people there in the evening, and it’s great place to find people.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Anyway, what is the request?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Archfiend subjugation.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see… wait, ehh!?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was quite confused by the sudden request, but when Anorn explained calmly, she seemed to reluctantly agree. In the end,</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I have experience defeating archfiends, so I’m sure I can handle it. And when it comes down to it, I’ll just use this simple-minded man as bait and we’ll be on our way!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She was forced to accept it, but…</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">The location changed to the Adventurer’e Guild in Mysia. It seemed to be mercenary guild in a large city, and it was crowded with people. At a tavern in the middle of it, Alfiris, Anorn, and Albert were having a consultation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Many of thses guilds are attached to taverns and restaurants. It is a common practice for travelers to go to a tavern if they want to get information, and mercenaries often hang out in these places to get information about each country as quickly as possible. This was the place where they were going to have dinner and find out who they were looking for.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But why do we need one only?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「In ancient times, a party of four has been required to defeat an archfiend.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I think there were times when it was three.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I remember the first time there was only one.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「&ndash;? What are you talking about?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris can’t keep up with what the two of them are saying at all.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「No, I’m pretty sure in some other cases it was five.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s fluid. There was even one time where 12 of us beat up one of them.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Didn’t they have, like, 50 people?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Maybe 30? I don’t know much about that.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Please, tell me something I can understand! Or is it my fault for being naive!?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">They don’t think that’s the problem. Alfiris’ scream changed the subject.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But the matter of fact is that all three of us are more like vanguards. It would be helpful to have a support person. I think mage mercenaries are rare, but in a city this big, they might be around.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, I thought Sister were supposed to be at the rear?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, yes, but at this point I think I can defend myself better than Alfie.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, no…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">At these words, Alfiris nodded pitifully. She have been in the mercenary business for almost a year now, and she thought she was getting used to it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But what about recruiting?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ll take care of it.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Anorn stepped out into the open where everyone in the tavern could see her. At that moment, all the lights went out except for the one shining on her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Why!?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris’ question was inevitable, but at any rate, everyone in the room stopped bustling about to see what was going on and turned their attention to the sister.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ladies and gentlemen… I’m in a great deal of trouble.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The sister appeals to everyone with moist eyes. Anorn must have her eyedrops hidden in her sleeve earlier.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m a Sister of the Church of Arnelia and one of my travelling companions has fallen ill, but I must continue my journey by order of the church. I’m looking for a strong person to protect me, but I can’t seem to find one… If you don’t mind, can one of you protect me?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">There, she shows them her tears. Alfiris wondered what kind of training this sister had in her life. From Alfiris’ point of view, it seemed like “wow… what a monkey show”, but it had a great effect on the men in the guild.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Sister! I’ll protect you!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What are you talking about? You bastard can’t do it! I’ll protect you, Sister!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, if that’s the case, I’ll do it!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You can’t protect her if you’re a poor bastard like this. Stop before you embarrass yourself!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「A rude person like you will only hurt this delicate sister. Pull yourself together!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What the hell, you bastard!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">In no time at all, a fight broke out over Anorn’s companion. It was a huge brawl inside the tavern.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I wonder if all the men in the world are like this… Master, I’m 18 and about to give up at finding my boyfriend…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">In the middle of the hustle and bustle, Alfiris was secretly losing herself in the despair of life. But she couldn’t stay like that forever. As if to interrupt the brawl, she rushed to Anorn’s side.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(But what do we actually do here?)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「(Should we just let these guys fight it out until there’s only one left, and then take the survivor.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(How can you do that?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(It’s easy. I’ll just say,『Now you’re going to kill each other.』There solved!)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「(Fraud and inducement to murder? That’s not an idea should be coming from a Sister!)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The inside of the guild was already in chaos. The clerk lady at the reception desk was frothing and almost fainted from the sheer destruction of the guild.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Shouldn’t this Sister create her own religion? She’s going to take the world by storm.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">While Alfiris was fantasizing about this, in reality, the atmosphere was such that they might actually kill each other. At that moment, someone tugged on Alfiris’ sleeve.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Who is it? I’m kind of busy…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Those simpletons will slow you down one way or the other. If you’re going to take them, let me do it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">When she turned around, she saw a girl of about 14 or 15 standing there, but as soon as Alfiris saw the girl, her eyes widened. Her skin was as white as porcelain, and her face was as neat as a doll’s. She was beautiful, of course, but her overly tidy appearance made her seem less human than she really was. In fact, the girl was expressionless. In addition, the color of her hair, which reached her waist, was very distinctive. Rumor has it that in the East, there is a tree called Sakura that blooms in the spring with pale peach petals, but isn’t that what they call her hair color? Furthermore, the fact that she was carrying a white cane suggested that she was blind. But most of all, Alfiris felt…</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I wonder… it’s as if the space around her has been cut off.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As if ignoring the hustle and bustle around her, only her surroundings are quiet. It was as if she had stepped out of a single portrait and was looking at her.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Ahh! Watch out!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">A liquor bottle came flying out of nowhere towards her. Alfiris tried to get it in the air, but she couldn’t seem to get in time.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(It’s going to hit her…!)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was about to run over to her, when the girl quickly caught the bottle in midair. She gulped it down and then…</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Eh, you’re drinking it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「This is Dia fruit juice, I was hoping for Cucus fruit juice, but I didn’t expect to find that in the spur of the moment. I’m not done yet, am I?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">When Alfiris looked closely, she saw that it was indeed a fruit juice bottle. Alfiris’ expression showed that she was curious as to how she knew, but the girl was quick to retort.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You do think I was actually drinking, do you? Good grief. I’m not even sixteen and so it’s natural for me to not drink any alcohol. You’re actually an idiot, aren’t you?」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Then she turned her expression to Alfiris and with a blank expression, said,「Hnn!」And then she made a gesture of disgust.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris felt as if she had been caught off guard by a peashooter.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Unlike Anorn, who’s not very foul-mouthed, but this kid is the opposite of it…)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see. You’re a sensor, aren’t you?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn leaned forward.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Yes, ma’am. You noticed?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yeah, when a blind child makes such a great catch. Do you have a rank in the guild?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Sort of.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">With a chirp, the girl pulls out a rank insignia from her chest, which she wears around her neck. The rank insignia showed a bow with three arrows.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「I see, C Rank huh? Alfie, she’s ranked higher than you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「W&ndash;wow… I’m surprised…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Once again, Alfiris is drooping. She thinks that she might been a slob ever since she came to Mysia.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「A sensor, and a C+ at that age…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t know about the details of the request, but is this good enough level for a sensor?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Certainly.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「There are definitely some skilled people in this guild, but they are all out of town. I’m sure I’m a lot better than all of the dorks here.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’re actually right. Then I have decided on you!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You and I seem to be on the same page, Sister. Let’s get along. Oh, you big, useless swordswoman, you’re different. In your case, use honorifics with me!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris is pointed out by the girl firmly.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What, why?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I won’t tolerate any backchat.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ve made up my mind…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「So, what’s your name?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn spoke to her as if nothing had happened.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I apologise for my behavior. My name is Lisa Fandoland. You can call me 『Lisa-chan.』」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Okay, Lisa-chan. I’m Sister Anorn.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s nice to meet you.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The girl, who called herself Lisa, gave Anorn a polite bow. Alfiris also offered her hand to Lisa.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/YRv4YDQ/0127.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="calibre6">「It’s nice to meet you too, Lisa-chan. I’m Alfiris.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What’s with that hand? You’re too chummy. You can call me『Lisa-sama』 if you want, you tall bitch.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「……Fuh」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Why is it just me? And this guy who only reacts there is annoying too!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris’ stress was reaching its peak, but at any rate, the fourth member of the team had been decided.</p>
