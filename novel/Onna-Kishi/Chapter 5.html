<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Archfiend Battle in the Forest of Rukia</h3>

<p class="calibre6">*step, step*</p>

<p class="calibre6">They can hear the footsteps of four people walking in the forest. This is the Rukia Forest in the Karam Region. It’s a forest located just a stone’s throw away from the village of Roth, and at the same time, it’s forest where the existence of an Archfiend was confirmed. It is a young forest with few large trees, but people rarely enter it, and there are barely any weed-covered animal paths. The reason for the lack of human intervention might be the lack of resources.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There was no cleared ground and the forest was overgrown with knee-high grass.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「The sun is shining a little bit… the visibility isn’t so bad. Lisa, how much can you detect?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s not possible to reach a radius of 50 meters even when Lisa is in a right frame of mind. The radius may vary slightly. There is no sign of the enemy to date, but I recommend proceeding with caution.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Right. Alfie, you’ll take care of Lisa and the back.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I know.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">It has already beem almost an hour since they entered the forest of Rukia. The forest gradually gets deeper, but there is no sign of the enemy. They left the village early in the morning, so the sun should be gradually rising but they can’t shake the dim impression.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s not looking good…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Probably, I think it’s ward caused by a shadow fiend. The forest is not very deep, but the sun does not shine strongly.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I know, Albert. Why don’t you just sing a song and come out of there?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why don’t you try it? I won’t stop you, Anorn.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris adjusts her tone to Anorn’s light-hearted remark. Anorn cuts back in defeat.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「If I sing, all the enemies will listen to me and there will be no fighting. It’s better if Alfie sings.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why me?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I mean, don’t you remember? The second time we met, I made you drink a lot and crushed you, right? I thought you were asleep at that time, but then you suddenly woke up. You were singing『 Mr. Forest Wolf』in a loud voice. You don’t remember, do you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…No way?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Really. She even sang a new song for me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「When you say『dubious』you mean…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, it’s a limerick filled with xxx.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I, I can’t be bride anymore…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris said half-heartedly. The song was actually a lie, but it was so loud and so tone-deaf that the others tried to stop her, but she threw them all away.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In the end, the singing didn’t stop until Alfiris fell asleep again, and she remembered the owner working with a sad look on his face. Anorn couldn’t resist putting in her earplugs and waiting in the tavern for Alfiris to fall asleep in a drunken stupor.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was a masterpiece for Anorn, but she had brought it up because she was worried that the inexperienced Alfiris might be nervous but perhaps she didn’t need to worry about that. Alfiris had not changed from her usual self, whether she was slow or strong. As for Anorn, she could count on her, but she wondered if she had any reason to believe that she could behave normally. As they walked along making a small talk, Lisa noticed that the atmosphere had suddenly changed.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「… Everyone, this is strange.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa whispered.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…Ahh, you’re definitely right.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「There’s been no signs of any animals or even birds for some time now.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「They’re coming, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「They’re coming from… everywhere.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">The playful expression disappears from everyone’s face. With their weapons at the ready, Albert deploys to the right and Anorn to the left, while Alfiris and Lisa step back slightly. Anorn seems to be holding something in her mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Anorn, what’s that?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s a mouthpiece. If I don’t wear it, I step on it too hard and my teeth would crack.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was about to say something, but she no longer had time to do so.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Lisa, any sign of the enemy?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, not yet… but I can feel them.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Nnh. I’m feeling it too.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Be careful, Alfie… I think they’re coming from all directions except the back.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris keeps her arrows ready to fire at any moment. As if to speed up the response, her breathing becomes slightly faster and shallower. She can feel her heart beating a step faster.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Alfie! Down here!」</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/2yHXnMz/0209.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="calibre6">Lisa shouted. But which was faster? Alfiris threw her bow, drew her sword, and thrust it at the giant worm-like fiend that was trying to come out of the ground.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s an earthworm!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As soon as she said that, enemies came at her from all directions. Goblins attacked from above Albert’s head, and earthworms attacked from around Anorn. Orcs attacked from both sides, shouting strangely. The variety of demons is truly diverse.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「This is the army of Archfiend…!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmph, you little shit!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn took a swing of her mace and the earthworms around her were instantly cleaved away. She turned to the orcs,</p>

<p class="calibre6">「One, two!!!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She can almost hear sound of Anorn gritting her teeth as she crunches her way to Alfiris. With that momentum, Anorn swung her hammer-like mace at the orc’s throat. The orc tries to catch her with its club, but&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre6">Boom!</p>

<p class="calibre6">The top of the lead orc’s head was completely blown off and gone with popping sound. In fact, the club that the orc was holding blew backwards, knocking down the orcs behind them. Somewhat later, the wreckage and blood that risen above the blown-up orc fell like rain. The orcs finally came to their senses and went into panic, but it was already too late.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Come on!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Each time Anorn swung her mace while shouting, the orc’s head, arms, and weapons that it tried to defend against were blown away without regard for the orc’s head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Orcs are larger and more powerful than humans, but they are much less intelligent. It is said that the only things they can think about are fighting, sleeping and reproduction, and once they get into a fight, they are said to be so excited that they forget themselves and rush at their enemies until they die. It seems that their instincts are well developed despite their low intelligence, and they must have realized that the woman in front of them was no ordinary opponent. Anorn, who rushed forward while being bathed in the blood of orcs, was more like a demon. At that moment, Anorn suddenly stumbled over something as she rushed forward.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Watch out!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn stumbled over a treant’s root. The branch tried to wrap itself to Anorn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「This is tricky, however&mdash;! I’ve heard that they’ve been showing up at Alfie’s, so I’m taking precautions, okay?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn threw a vial of something at the treant. At that moment, it suddenly began to suffer.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s a herbicide. But it’s strong enough to kill a big tree!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">She brought her mace back up and hit the treant with it. A muffled sound was heard and a vertical crack appeared.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「One more!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She also gave her all with a powerful blow that ripped the treant in half and shattered it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Anorn, that’s amazing! …How about Albert!?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">What Alfiris saw when turned around was an even more startling sight.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Swoosh!</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert shakes off the gore from his sword. At his feet was a pile of goblin corpses that he was too lazy to count. There must be more than thirty already.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There were probably dozens more goblins, but all of them were hesitant to pounce at Albert. Albert quickly sees this and without waiting for the goblins to move, he slashes at them. From that point on, it was a tremendous battle. No, it was a scene close to a massacre.</p>
<p class="calibre6">With one swing of Albert’s sword, three or four goblins fell, on rather, were obliterated. The goblins were slightly smaller than humans. One of the astonishing moments was when they cut down a goblin that was trying to hide behind a tree. The tree seemed to be so thick that even Alfiris hugged it, she couldn’t get her hands around of it, but she was one hell of a swordswoman.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Many of the goblins begin to flee. Just then, something grabbed one of the goblins by the head and squeezed it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s the Cyclops!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, it’s a Gigantes, a higher form of it. I’m sure you’ll be pleased to know that I’m not the only one who’s a bit of an idiot and can’t use a weapon, but that one does have a hammer, doesn’t it?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn, who had already cleaned up the left side, was coming back.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「We have to join them.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t think I need to do it. I’m not a Lazaar.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「B&mdash;But they’re so different in size, aren’t they?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Gigantes is more than three meters tall. The hammer in its hand is already bigger than Albert’s.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well, just watch. All of Lazaar’s people are not normal. After, the first one is a swordsman who singlehandedly wiped out the Archfiend’s arms and even the hunted the Archfiend.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Really?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well, maybe I am exaggerating a little, but a swordsman who came from slavery became the captain of the Kingsguard of Temple Order? And the vote was unanimous. I wouldn’t be surprised if they really did something like that, since they were able to move those hardheaded church members.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And Albert is called the strongest of all of them. If we hadn’t been nearby this time, he might have completed this mission alone. So don’t worry about it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The moment Anorn’s story was cut short, the two bodies moved. Both of them swung their prey from the upper level, and their prey crossed each other &ndash; but the sword that Albert swung down completely dented the hilt of Gigantes’ hammer and sliced through Gigantes’ waist. In a moment of desperation, it jumped into the air just as Gigantes fell to its knees, and with a sword that cut back from the bottom up, he separated Gigantes’ neck and body.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Returned blood splattered Albert.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I can’t believe you could do that with a sword that doesn’t have any weight on it…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s brilliant.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">However, Albert is still on his toes. Seeing this, the others suddenly regained their alertness. At the same moment, Alfiris and the others jumped at the same time.</p>
<p class="calibre6">With a loud explosion and a blast of wind, a hand of fire rises in the place where Alfiris and the others were. It was a fire-based magic. Where did they come from? But before they can even think about it, Alfiris is searching for the enemy’s location while darting her arrows.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「There!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris shoots an arrow imbued with magic. The target was about 50 meters away. A demonic-looking monster with horns on its head. It seems to be in the role of a commander. The monster tried to avoid Alfiris’ arrow. The average power in this era has a killing power of about 20 meters and flies only in a straight line, so it would not normally bit from such a long distance, but Alfiris’ arrows are enhanced with wind magic.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The arrow bends in the air in an impossible direction and strikes the fiend. The fiend seemed to be taken aback, but as expected, it reacted sharply and used its arm as a shield to avoid a fatal wound.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You can’t hit it with a single shot at this distance, after all.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">But while Alfiris was saying that, Anorn and Albert were already closing the distance towards the fiend. Just as the fiend was about to reposition itself to face Albert,</p>

<p class="calibre6">Thump!</p>

<p class="calibre6">A new horn sprouted on the fiend’s head with a sound like ripping flesh. No, in a closer observation, it looks like a blade from behind a tree.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Who is… uh, Lisa?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「This place is appetizing, I’ll take it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Before he knew it, Lisa was standing behind the fiend. It was the same time that Alfiris realized this fact and the fiend fell with a thud.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Apparently, a blade was planted in the white came that indicated Lisa’s blindness. But when had she gotten behind it?</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa came back to Alfiris and the others, wiping the gore with a leaf.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Alfiris, you can’t afford to lose me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yeah, but you were behind me earlier…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s an application of the Sensor ability, isn’t it?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn looked at Lisa with an impressed look at her face. Lisa gave a small nod,</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Yes. If you can sense the presence of others, you can also do the opposite. I’ve made it extremely difficult to find me by suppressing your senses as opposed to letting them free.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She replied. Albert seemed to be convinced, but Alfiris, who had never heard of Sensors before, rolled her eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「How is that even possible?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You read that the commander would be there from the beginning didn’t you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes. The way the fiends attacked was so uniform that when the earthworms appeared, I probed them first and sneaked around behind them. Fortunately, it was humanoid, so I was able to finish it off.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s quite a feat.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m flattered, Sister.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa bowed to Anorn, but Alfiris came to her with a bang.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well, that’s the thing…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris looks uncomfortable because she is right. But seeing Alfiris in such a state, Lisa went after her even more.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「If Lisa were really just a weak girl and clung to you, the two of us would be blackened by now. It is true that big women are dull in many ways, isn’t it? I’m so tired.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Gghhh…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But it was a good time to shoot the arrow,, and my aim was good, so let’s just say that I don’t owe you anything this time. Without those arrows, you couldn’t have hit it from behind. Thank you Lisa for your generosity!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I wonder why I should be grateful to you…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Haa&mdash; Alfiris sighed.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Don’t get distracted. This is just the prelude.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s what I mean. If it was an opponent of this caliber, the investigation team would probably come back with at least one person, and the Archfiend might be a pretty big deal. There were advanced fiends under its command that used magic, you know?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The two people, Albert and Anorn looked grim. Lisa reacted quickly as well.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Looks like it. The big one is coming. Azimuth one o’clock distance 70 meters.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Here comes the commander! My arms are ringing.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Alfiris-sama, stand back. Apparently, it’s quite large.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Okay. Lisa, let’s keep our distance.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Leaving Albert and Anorn in the vanguard, Alfiris and Lisa moved back a little. Not long after, they began to hear a cracking sound of a tree being knocked down. It was something… that could knock down a huge tree was advancing towards Alfiris and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The tension in the area was rising, but Alfiris’ instincts told her that she was in the greatest danger she had ever known. The hairs on her skin stood on end and would not go away. She wondered if there was some shivering in her body. And then it appeared in front of Alfiris and the others.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Wh-what is that?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well… that’s quite an ugly one you got there.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ve never seen such a description of a fiend before. I can’t tell if it’s an evil spirit, a fiend or a mineral lifeform.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It could be any of those things. I’ve never seen a fiend described like this.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lisa can vaguely sense what it looks like, but it’s definitely hard to classify it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was confused, but so was everyone else. That’s probably true, too. First of all, the fiend in front of them was walking with its hand. It seemed to have about ten arms instead of legs. Furthermore, the shape of the arms resembled human arms, but the length and thickness were all different, with no sense of unity. The thickest arm are so long as tbe torso of a Gigantes.</p>
<p class="calibre6">And the body, or rather, the head, is indistinguishable from the body, but it is shaped like a shiny black obsidian column. It is thick as the Treant from a moment ago. There are ten, no, eleven hands attached to the base of it. An odd number is asymmetrical as hell. And whether you call it a body or a face, there are eyes and mouths irregularly attached to what they would describe as a torso. They had no idea how many eyes and mouths there are, and their sizes are all over the place.</p>
<p class="calibre6">They wondered how long it was. It’s much bigger than the Gigantes they saw earlier. At any rate, it seemed to have a girth of about five meters. What made Alfiris and the others frown more than its ugliness was the smell it emitted.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What is this smell? Lisa felt it uncomfortable.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I wonder what it are. I’m not sure, but its mouth stinks.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s not that bad of a smell.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Are you sure this is the Archfiend?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’ll never know. The ones I’ve met are a bit more creaturely. At the very least, none of them looked like they had been dragged out of a human nightmare into reality.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As Alfiris and the others stepped back to get some distance, this fiend stepped on a Gigantes’ corpse. The eyes of the body all turned to look at it at once. It picked up Gigantes and looked at the corpse curiously. Just as Alfiris and the others were wondering what was going on.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hii?!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris couldn’t help but let out a scream. The ore-like body part cracked into two and became a large mouth, which began to eat Gigantes without a second thought.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Crack, crack, crunch! Biting, biting, biting…</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris and the others could do nothing but watch as the fiend chewed on the Gigantes. The blood and flesh of the Gigantes were splattered all around them. It was a horrible, horrible sight. No one uttered a single word, or rather, they were unable to. This fiend was now completely beyond their imagination.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As soon as the fiend finished eating the Gigantes, its eyes, which had been closed, all snapped open at once! And began to shed tears of blood. At the same time, the small mouths on various parts of its body began to open and it started to laugh strangely. The archfiend is happy &ndash; the scene was so abnormal that it exceeded her imagination, and Alfiris felt dizzy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s coming…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ehh?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">When the Archfiend finished laughing, its eyes turned to Alfiris and the others at once.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Move!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">At the signal of Anorn’s voice, everyone dispersed as if in flight. The Archfiend attacked with a strange and indescribable voice.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As before, Anorn and Albert deployed to the left and right, while Alfiris and Lisa retreated to keep their distance. The archfiend’s eyes moved dizzily, catching each of the four of them.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Are you saying that all eyes see separately?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris retreated, picked up an arrow and shot it at the eye, one of the three arrows hit the eye of the Archfiend, but the moment it hit, the Archfiend once again laughed happily. Then, where there was no eye before, a new one opened.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What the hell is this? It’s not working?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I thought the eyes were its weakness!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Alfiris, buy us some time. I will use Lisa’s power to find this ugly bitch’s weakness!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Copy that!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris shoots arrows while protecting Lisa so that she can concentrate. Albert then precedes Anorn and slashes at her. Albert unleashes a slash, trying to sidestep the fiend, but</p>

<p class="calibre6">Dang!</p>

<p class="calibre6">And then there was a single loud sound and the Archfiend’s huge body… jumped.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「How did it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「How can it jumped with that huge body?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It was jumping higher than the surrounding trees. They thought it was going to fall straight down, but to their surprise, he used his hands to dexterously stick to the top of the tree. The great tree bent under the weight of the Archfiend.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Guh, you’re good!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「The sword will never reach me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, take cover!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">With a word from Alfiris, each of them jumped back from the spot. At the same time, something fell without a sound. And then, from the remains of the splattering and something falling, comes a sizzling smoke.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Acid!?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s why the mouth stinks. Too much gastric juice?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「This is no time to joke, okay?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">They all continued to avoid the fiend’s saliva. No, Albert was the only one who avoided the fiend’s saliva, but he was still heading towards it. Then, with a single sword, he slashes down the tree that the Archfiend is using as a foothold. It was a show of tremendous skill and power.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The Archfiend, as expected, lost its balance and fell. It held out its hand to stop Albert from slashing over. But, it wasn’t trying to stop him, it was trying to counterattack. For a moment, its other hand shriveled, and the thickness of the hand it was about to use to fight back doubled.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert who was about to slash off its arm, reflexively rolled forward to avoid it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Crack! Crack!</p>

<p class="calibre6">The swinging arms snaps all the tree in its path. It was one hell of a blow. But Albert’s reflexes were not to be outdone. After spinning forward once, he used the recoil to lunge forward even further, slicing off three shriveled arms at once.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「There’s an opening!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn tried to follow, but the Archfiend’s mouth gaped open and a black mist sprayed out.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s a Breath!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Tsk!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As soon as the two of them avoided it, the trees around them rotted into goo all at once. It’s the breath of corrosion. It must have a taken less than a minute from the time the Archfiend appeared to the time of the attack. But it was a dense exchange of lives that felt as if they had been fighting for hours. Of course, Alfiris had never experienced a battle like this.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(It was one hell of a fight. I’m certainly not strong enough.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris forgot to shoot the arrow and looked at it somewhat. Lisa murmured behind her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「… Oh no!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What’s wrong, Lisa?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I can’t find anything that looks like a weakness in that fiend.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What do you mean?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Normally, any living creature has a weak point. I can detect it by the flow of its body, its presence, or even its chi, or the way it protects itself… The contents of that fiend are always moving, and there is no definitive weakness.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What did you say!?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa is upset. It seemed that the Archfiend in front of her was a monster beyond her imagination. But Albert cut off three of its arms a while ago, so it’s not like it can die. Yet,</p>

<p class="calibre6">【Summon】</p>

<p class="calibre6">As soon as they thought they heard an eerie voice, something that looked like a magic circle appeared around the fiend. Then, the goblins and orcs are summoned from there. They didn’t know that it could do this, they’re now that in front of them is truly a Archfiend.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I see, so this is how you summon your minions.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「This is no time to be impressed, we can’t afford to deal with the other fiends!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, summons are not a problem… What the?」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Anorn raised her voice in astonishment. Instead of using the summoned fiends as a fighting force, this Archfiend grabbed them and it started to them from the head up. As expected, Albert was stunned, but what was even more surprising was that the amount of food it ate, the arm he cut off regenerated.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The newly-summoned and slow-moving fiends are screaming and running away from this unusual situation, but the Archfiend doesn’t seem to want to let any of them go, and is devouring them one by one. The Archfiend seemed to be interested in eating the fiends it had summoned, leaving Alfiris and the others alone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Alfiris and the others forgot to fight and watched the scene in amazement.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…None of the survey team should have come back. We’ll never make it back with this thing chasing us.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hey, hey. Is this the kind of creature the Archfiend is?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, I’ve had my share of pricks, but never one this ugly. To be honest, I’m fed up with it too.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It doesn’t seem to have any weaknesses. What should we do? I think this is a situation where running away is an option to consider.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa, as expected, was a little uneasy. But after a few moments of hesitation, Anorn replied.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「There’s a way. It’s dangerous, though.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「And I’m not sure if I can escape. There is one eye that has been constantly looking at us. If it starts to run away, it will come towards us at once. Apparently, its intelligence is reasonably high.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert, who was about to slash at it when he saw an opening, pulled back to Alfiris and the others. And when Alfiris looked at the point where he was pointing, she noticed that apart from the eyes that were moving rapidly as they chased goblins, there was another eye that was looking at them without even blinking.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Then, I’ll come back at once when I’m done eating.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Right. Then let’s fight for now. Lisa, can you use your sensor ability to get its attention?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I can do that, but… you want Lisa to take the bait?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa looked incredulous, but Anorn’s expression was serious.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m sorry, but that’s the way it is. Alfie will take the role of an escort instead. You can find a slightly open area about 300 meters back from here. Can you lead her there?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s not the most pleasant thing in the world to have a large woman as an escort, but… we have no choice, let’s do it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Good. You’ll be able to find a lot more than just a few of them. Albert, just think about cutting its torso in half. If it’s still alive, or if you can’t stop it, retreat at once. Any objections?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Everyone replied with their eyes that there was no dependence.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Okay, Lisa, you have 30 seconds to do it. Me and Albert will get to that point first, but good luck to all of us!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">After confirming that they all nodded to each other, the two of them ran ahead. The remaining Lisa sighed.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I knew it was going to be difficult request, but I didn’t expect it to turn out like this… Do it right, Alfie.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Leave it to me! … It’s not like I would be able protect you that much, but I’ll try my best to protect Lisa.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I trust your words more than your confidence. I’ll give you a perfect score, Alfie.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, that’s unusual.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa remembered how she had backed off the female swordsman in front of her at the guild, not Anorn nor Albert. She felt that the two of them were overwhelmingly strong, but her instincts had told her that this female swordsman was the most reliable. Why did she talk to the swordswoman in front of her and accept the request without asking her what it was? Lisa was not convinced of her actions.</p>
<p class="calibre6">However, after parting ways with her, she tried to reconsider her decision, but while her rational mind knew that this request was highly dangerous, her instincts told her to go. Lisa had never gambled on a request based on instinct, but for some reason she felt she should do it this time.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She had only been with Alfiris for a day or so when she accepted the request, but she had a feeling of certainty. She was sure that she would continue to involve with this female swordsman. There was no way she would die here. Before that, there were circumstances that required Lisa to return to Mysia no matter what. And Lisa made up her mind.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So much for joking around. Let’s go, Alfie.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Anytime, Lisa!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa’s senses flew like sonar to attract the Archfiend’s attention, and instantly the Archfiend’s eyes all turned towards Alfiris and Lisa at once. From here on, it’s a deadly game of tag.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Kuh, fuu!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris is desperately trying to keep in time while dodging the Archfiend’s outstretched hand. She is shooting arrows as she runs away in a different direction from Lisa. Alfiris decided that it would be dangerous to let Lisa go in such a dire situation, since she is still blind, even though she is light.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Therefore, she instructed Lisa to run in a straight line to her destination, while Alfiris ran in a zigzag pattern to attract the attention of the Archfiend. And every time Alfiris was about to fall into a pinch, Lisa would sent out a signal to draw its attention.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The Archfiend has many eyes, so whenever Lisa sends out a signal, it reacts and turns its eyes, which momentarily distract its attention from Alfiris. She took advantage of this ans kept her distance. It was good coordination for an impromptu event. This was also due to Lisa’s superior ability.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Alright, keep going…)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It opened up a bit, and she could see where she wanted to go. Less than 50 meters to go. Lisa had already reached the front of it. At that moment, the Archfiend’s eyes turned to Lisa at once.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「W&mdash;what?」</p>


<p class="calibre6">The Archfiend must have thought that she would not be able to get away from thia. In order to deal with Lisa first, it ignored Alfiris and started running towards her as fast it could.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Lisa, run!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The Archfiend leaped and rushed forward. It then spat out acid at Lisa in midair.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lisa, too, had sensed the movement and was already running toward the squa, jumping in front of it and rolling away. She just barely managed to avoid the acid, but it took her a while to get back up to her feet. It only took a few seconds, but by the time Lisa stood up, the Archfiend had caught up to her, less than ten meters away.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「She was less than ten meters away from the rendezvous… Lisa!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was about to shoot an arrow, but Lisa raises her hand to restrain Alfiris. It was a guess that she’s trying to take care of it herself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It is true that if the Archfiend rushes again to Alfiris, who is behind it, she will be in danger and assistance may be ruined.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I don’t care!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Despite Alfiris’ concern, Lisa remained calm. Even though she was face to face with the Archfiend, her breathing was almost unsteady. She is a woman of great courage. The Archfiend gradually closed the distance, but did not make any sudden moves. Lisa, too moved back slowly as the Archfiend moved. Eight meters to go, seven meters to go… five meters to go…</p>
<p class="calibre6">At this point, the Archfiend made its move. It went to catch Lisa with its hand, but she dodged. But there was a tree in the direction she had dodged, and the Archfiend, perhaps anticipating this move, spat out acid in the direction Lisa had jumped. But Lisa remains calm.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「I’ve already detected it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She then used her robe to block the acid and hide herself from the Archfiend’s sight for a moment. She also took off her robe and kicked the tree well to gain distance at once. The frustrated Archfiend rushed forward witb a strange voice. And the moment Lisa and the Archfiend entered the square…</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Lisa! Jump to the side!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">With Anorn’s sharp voice, the entire area around them was enveloped in light.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What is this? A light bomb?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It was designed to deprive the opponent of vision by creating a flash of light instead of an explosion. It is mainly used when you want to take your opponent alive, but Alfiris had never heard of a bomb with such strong light. It may have been a special product of Anorn, but Alfiris could not see anything either.</p>
<p class="calibre6">And then the Archfiend, caught off guard, stopped moving for a moment. Taking advantage of the gap, Anorn uses the sacred magic of the anti-magic system.</p>

<p class="calibre6">【I am an obedient servant of the Lord of the Light, and an enforcer of Her Laws, and I am about to capture an evil soul and place it in Her Hands. Here’s a glimpse of your miracle.】</p>


<p class="calibre6">《Blaze Prison!》</p>

<p class="calibre6">The light became a captive net and entangles the Archfiend. This is the first time Alfiris have seen it, but it must be a pretty high ranking magic. After all, there is no doubt that Anorn is a high-ranking priestess.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The Archfiend, having lost its freedom struggles in the web of light, but it does not come off easily.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Go on, Albert!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ohhhhh!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Without a moment’s hesitation, Albert slashed it. With his first blow, he sliced.off one of the Archfiend’s hands at once. He spun around, using the space created by his fidgeting to slash the Archfiend, who loses its balance and falls down, with his full power.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Mmhn!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The sword that Albert raised to cut the body into a circle. The Archfiend was helplessly cut in half and fell down with a thud. At the same time as the Archfiend fell, blood spurted from the cur, the open mouth and eyes gradually closed, and the hands rotted away as if they were melting.</p>
<p class="calibre6">After witnessing the scene, Alfiris ran up to Lisa.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Lisa! Are you okay?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m fine, Alfie. It’s just a little scratch.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m sorry, I couldn’t pull it…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t worry, but they took care if all but a few more steps of the retreating process. Lisa was prepared to do half of it, depending on yhe situation. Well, apparently, it would have been impossible for Lisa to get away with a few dozen steps. Not bad for a big girl.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Goodness, you’re really mouthful for a child.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris tried to hit Lisa in the head, but she ducked. She tried to hit her again, but she dodged again. This time, she tried a series of feints, but they were all avoided.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…I&mdash;It’s not cute!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ve already detected it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa giggled and smiled.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I think we’re getting to know each other a little better.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">But still, through this series of battles, Alfiris felt as if she became a little closer to Lisa.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Did we do it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t know. But it’s a lot of damage, isn’t it? We’d better burn it to the ground without a trace.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Then prepare for that.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn and Albert are looking at the body of the Archfiend that has stopped moving. Just because someone cut the body in half doesn’t mean it’s dead, but at least it doesn’t seem to be moving right now. If that’s the case, Anorn instructed Albert and Alfiris to burn the body completely while it’s still alive. Since the Arnelia Church sometimes deals with moving corpses(zombies), they carry a certain amount of fuel and holy water for cremation. Tbis time, of course, they were prepared.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The luggage that was in the way of Albert’s slashing attack was placed in the shade. When Albert and Alfiris turned their backs to the Archfiend to get the fuel in bag,</p>

<p class="calibre6">「! Not yet! Don’t be foolish, Alfie!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">From the direction where the Archfiend’s corpse was supposed to be, something that looked like arrows flew at Alfiris. She was completely caught off guard and could not react to avoid them before turning around.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lisa hugged her to protect but the lightweight Lisa could not push Alfiris down in time. And then&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre6">Boom! Bo-boom! Boom!</p>

<p class="calibre6">A sound that clearly pierced the flesh echoed dully.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「(Ehh…? I, am I dead…?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">But Alfiris felt no pain. Fearfully, she opened her eyes &ndash;&ndash;</p>

<p class="calibre6">「No…way…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn was standing in front of them, facing behind as if she was protecting Alfiris and others. There was something protruding from her body.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…Anorn, I don’t remember you wearing this kind of equipment.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…You’re not hurt, are you guys?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Anorn!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris comes back to herself at Lisa’s words. She holds Anorn as she falls, but blood is spurting from Anorn’s mouth.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「I, can’t believe… this… *cough*」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn is spitting out a lot of blood more.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Anorn! Anorn! Oh, my God, I can’t stop the bleeding. Alfie, what are you blubbering about! Stop the bleeding!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why… why is this thing sticking out of Anorn’s chest?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Several arrow-like objects are piercing her body, and there is an arrow sticking out from where her heart is. This was… not going to save her. Alfiris is calmly analyzing the unrealistic scene somewhere in her mind, while Lisa is in a complete frenzy of panic.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I don’t care what it is, just get something to stop the bleeding quickly!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「This is… a fatal wound, right…?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Alfie&ndash;!!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why… You’re strong, Anorn, right…? Why…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Her pulse… her pulse is weakening rapidly… This is not…」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Lisa was doing her best to call out to Anorn, but her voice faded into the distance as if it were a distant world, and Alfiris’ eyes went dark. She could see the figure of Albert re-holstering his sword, but it seemed as if it had happened in a dream.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Albert… where the hell are you pointing your sword at?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">And where Alberto’s sword was pointing…</p>
<p class="calibre6">The Archfiend had begun to regenerate, but not exactly. Something flesh-like was crawling out from the two pillars that had been cut into rings. Then it transformed into a human shape.</p>
<p class="calibre6">One of them had a large eye on what looked like its face. On the other, small eyes appeared all over the body. They all had one thing in common: a large mouth opening vertically in the middle of their bodies. They also have five and six hands, respectively. There are no fingers on the ends of the hands, but claw-like things groe irregularly. And when their eyes recognized Alfiris and others, they started laughing and giggling.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Alfiris-dono, we must retreat! Take Sister and hurry! I’ll buy us some time!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Get out of my way, Albert.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Alfiris-dono!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I said, get out of the way!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">At that moment, Albert felt a tremendous killing power coming from behind him, and he winced. He had been holding a sword for about 20 years, and had already been on the battlefield for 10 years. He had felt fear and cold sweat at times, but he had never once been stuck under pressure. Albert was unable to take a single step, let alone look back. And Alfiris walked leisurely forward beside him.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「You, did you do this to Anorn?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The Archfiend and the others continued to laugh without answering the question in a voice so low and intimidating that it was hard ti believe it was from a woman.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「… Stop that annoying laugh!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris shouted, and the air in the area trembled softly. Even the Archfiend were surprised and stopped laughing.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Even if I cut you in half, you won’t die… Okay, I’ll wipe you out without a trace.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris utters a dark and deep voice that they have never heard before. Then Alfiris tore off the sleeve of her right arm, revealing the spell mark underneath her clothes. It wriggled and squirmed like a living organism, and at the same time, some kind of black liquid oozed out, forming a small jet-black puddle at her feet. It resembled blood, but it was too black for that.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Alfiris, the sight of such a black thing (curse mark) writhing on a woman’s body was physiologically repulsive to Albert, who was watching. But Alfiris didn’t care at all. She was probably too angry to care anymore.</p>

<p class="calibre6">【Release】</p>


<p class="calibre6">With that one word, the words on her right arm appear in the air.</p>

<p class="calibre6">【The ancient seal that swore an oath to me, grant me power for the price of my flesh and blood. The master of your pledge is Alfiris. By her cause and law, devour all of my enemies!】</p>

<p class="calibre6">It then recombines in midair and returns to Alfiris’ right arm. And then, from Alfiris’ body, a visible amount of magic power began to spill out.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">A gaseous aura was continuously emanating from Alfiris’ body. When a person who has studied magic releases its magic power to the fullest, it is possible to see an aura that corresponds to the nature of the person. The color indicates the attribute of the magic used or the nature of the user. And the shape usually looks like a film that is stretched around of it, it can look like a liquid or jelly that is stretched over the body, but Alfiris’ is different from any of those.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The amount of air she was emitting was so great that it was as if she was continuously spewing air from her entire body. The colors were not also constant, appearing to shine in seven or even more colors depending on the light or something else. The quantity and were so different.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Seeing Alfiris’ condition, the Archfiends must have sensed the danger, because both of them started to back away.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You think you escape? 《Forest Bind》」</p>

<p class="calibre6">At the sound of Alfiris’ voice, the surrounding trees quickly grew and entangled the Archfiends. They struggled to escape and cut the trees with their claws, but the trees that grew after them did not allow to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Both Albert and Lisa could only watch in amazement at the astonishing scene. And then,</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m going to cut you apart so badly you won’t be able to regenerate.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As Alfiris smiled wryly, a stronger wind began to whip up from her. The grass was being torn in a radial pattern, with Alfiris at the center.</p>


<p class="calibre6">【I prostate myself before Tifoeus, God of the Wind, and implore him.】</p>

<p class="calibre6">A stronger wind gathers around Alfiris!</p>

<p class="calibre6">【Give your blessings to the wind spirits that gather in my palm. Use your power to seize those before me in the prison of the air.】</p>

<p class="calibre6">《Mountain’s Blow》</p>

<p class="calibre6">In an instant, a giant hand the size of a man made of wind floated up. And it wasn’t just one, but a succession of similarly sized hands floating around her. And those hands attacked the Archfiends from all directions.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Geeeeahhhhhhh!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The Archfiends crumpled their bodies as if they were being crushed by a huge mass of wind. But the overwhelming torrent of wind drowns out the screams of the Archfiends, and even their blood is swept up in the prison of wind. However, even in the midst of this, the Archfiends are still trying to regenerate their bodies. Isn’t that still a fatal wound? When Albert and Lisa thought about this,</p>

<p class="calibre6">【Feed on my blood, fire spirits!】</p>


<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was in her next sorcerous chant. The aura around her had turned red before she knew it. She lightly slashed her own palm, causing blood to drip onto the ground. Then the blood began to gurgle and bubble as if it was boiling, spreading all over the place, and several flaming beasts came out of it. Birds, wolves, horses, and bears came out one after another.</p>

<p class="calibre6">【I divided the gathered spirits and put them in a empty vessel and let them dance. I will make a further sacrifice to the dancing spirits.】</p>

<p class="calibre6">《Flame Capriccio!》</p>

<p class="calibre6">With that one word, the soaring beasts attacked the Archfiends all at once. Then, under the influence of wind magic around them, they became like a tornado of flames. Ss the name of the chant suggests, it was a mad banquet itself. The Archfiends desperately tried to shake off the flames, but even the fire sparks that they had shaken off attacked the Archfiends again. It was not just fire magic that Alfiris chanted, but a kind of dark magic.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There are two types of magic: one is based on attributes and the other is based on usage. In the case of attributes, it is fire and water, but the system of usage is a bit more complicated.</p>
<p class="calibre6">To introduce some of them, there are spirit magic based on pure faith, logical magic based on arithmetic, and summoning magic based on contracts. Incidentally, what Alfiris just used is dark magic that requires some kind of sacrifice or price from the user. Dark magic is a dangerous kind of magic that requires a great deal of sacrifice, but it is also powerful.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In any case, what Alfiris unleashed was a dark fire magic that would not disappear until the target was burned to the ground. Even the Archfiends were swallowed up by the fire and wind, and not even their screams could be heard. Alfiris just stared at the scene without any emotion, without even blinking.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then the fire subsided, and there was literally not even a speck of dust left behind. After confirming that the enemy had been defeated, Alfiris slowly looked back at the direction of Anorn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ah…」</p>


<p class="calibre6">The Alfiris who turned around was like a different person. Her expression, which should always be cheerful, was expressionless, but there was something tremendous about her. Even Lisa, who was blind, could see that Alfiris had an unusual expression on her face. Even without an expression, her eyes were filled with sadness. And the murderous energy emanating from her body seemed to have no end in sight.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lisa tried to say something, but it was inaudible. She was so overwhelmed by Alfirus’ magical power and deadly energy that she forgot that she was holding Anorn in her arms.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/hFxDPSQ/0220.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="calibre6">「(Such tremendous magical power… The first one was not even chanted. It was not a mistake for me to pull Alfiris’ sleeve after all!)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Alfiris-dono?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert called out to her, but she didn’t respond. Alfiris’ gait was sluggish. She was wavering, as if she were floating in a fever.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Anorn… I couldn’t help you… I’m sorry….」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris fainted on th le spot while muttering.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was dreaming. It was a part of a conversation she had once had with her master, Aldorius.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Hey, hey, Master. What will happen if I release the spell?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Let’s see. It may be good when you are using it, but you will be very tired afterwards. Also, if you carefully release it, the erosion of the spell mark will continue. Then the pain will become stronger.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What if I keep using it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Alfie will cease to be Alfie and the mark will become you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I&mdash;I don’t want that. Then, I’ll never use the spell mark!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris looks up at Aldrius with moist eyes as if frightened. Aldrius smiles gently at Alfiris.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Yes, that’s good. But it’s no good if you die, and there may be times when you really need to use it. You’ll have to carefully assess when, where and if you need to use it, okay?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmmm… I think I got it, but I don’t know…?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris crossed her arms and tilted her head, and Aldrius look at her smugly.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m fine with that for now. If, for example, you have an important friend and you want to help him or her, you might be able to use it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Okay, then I will, Master!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Aldrius pat Alfiris on the head for her cheerful reply.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Alright, good girl. The spell mark can also be released by strong negative emotions, so be very careful, okay? Now, I’ll tell you how to release the spell mark in case of emergency&mdash;」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Then, Aldrius tells Alfiris how to do it when she releases the spell mark. At that time, Alfiris didn’t really understand what it meant to release the spell mark.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(That’s right. I’ve decided that it’s okay to release the spell mark in order to protect my friends. If I released from the beginning, Anorn would not have died… I’m sorry, I’m sorry, Anorn&mdash;)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris’ consciousness awakens as she grasps the light.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Anorn!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmm, what is it?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">When Alfiris jumped up from her reverie, she found herself in bed. Anorn was sitting in front of her as if nothing had happened. Apparently, she was peeling a fruit with a knife. It was quite a brilliant knife work.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You’re very good… But that’s not it! I, I thought Anorn was dead…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t kill me when I’m here! I’m still kicking you know?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ehh, but, it’s because Anorn was stabbed through the heart… was I dreaming?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Yeah, she was pierced, wanna see?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Her clothes were indeed torn everywhere, matching the places where Alfiris had seem her pierced. It was definitely not a dream. But there was not a single scratch on Anorn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But why there’s no single wound?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Nnhn… I didn’t mean to trick you but… I can’t die no matter what I do.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn speaks uncomfortably.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I wasn’t born this way, though. For now, I won’t die no matter what they do to me. I’ve been torn to pieces before, but I didn’t die.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, but if I lose my head, I won’t be able to move, you know? And it’s not like it doesn’t hurt. I don’t want to get stabbed in the heart, because it’s too painful to move.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Isn’t it uncomfortable, this human being. I don’t even know if I’m even human anymore. You don’t have to do this, Alfie. I’m going to disappear right in front of your eyes. I can’t travel together with this disgusting thing… It’s impossible…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Anorn!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ah, yes!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Suddenly a loud voice called her name, and Anorn couldn’t help but be awed.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Don’t you have something to say to me before you do that?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, I don’t think so. I was pretty determined to tell you…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Aaaannnoorrnn?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She doesn’t why it was like that, but Alfiris’ eyes were seriously angry.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I’ve never had anyone stare at me with such an attitude in all my years of traveling with this girl… no matter how much I teased her, she never got angry.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It was a very bad decision, but Anorn could not tell that the mood was not deceiving.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ah, uhh, sorry about that.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Good. You’re forgiven.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Then after saying it, Alfiris embraced Anorn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m sorry too… I dreamed that if I had released the power of the curse from the beginning, Anorn would have not died! But, but… I’m glad you’re alive… really!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris’ shoulders were trembling slightly. As she gently hugged her back, Anorn thought.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(She’s crying. She’s crying for me. This is the third person who has treated me the same way even though they know I’m immortal.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">A passionate feeling welled up in Anorn’s chest as well.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Do you even consider me a friend?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Of course I do! What are you talking about?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But I’m immortal. I’ve been alive for 300 years.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I don’t care! Anorn is Anorn, right?」</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/xfqQF30/0248.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris is looking straight into Anorn’s eyes. Anorn recalled that the same thing had happened to her a long time ago.</p>

<p class="calibre6">『Immortality? Does it matter?』</p>
<p class="calibre6">『Immortality? You’ll be beautiful forever then? That’s great!』</p>

<p class="calibre6">She remembered the faces of both of them as they stared straight at Anorn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I see. I think I understand what Master meant by moving forward. I can’t go on like this.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn made up her mind. Now… She’s sure that now is the time for her to go through this ordeal.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…Hey, Alfie. I will tell you this because it’s you. Will you listen to an old story?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…I’m okay with it」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Alfiris smiled gently. Anorn was relieved that she was alright, and she began to tell her about her past.</p>

<img src="" width= "345;" height= "460;"></img>

<p class="calibre6">「I was born in a village of apothecaries in the mountains.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn looked distantly at her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m the granddaughter of the chief. In the village, they called me 『Milady.』 I’m actually a one, you know?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn lets out a dry laugh. She seems to be somewhat mocking herself.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「In my village, we developed many kinds of medicines. Mostly medicines for recovery, but there were also people who made things like bombs, poisons… The most famous one was the elixir.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Elixir, you say, isn’t it the one famous for being able to bring back the dead?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn chuckles at Alfiris’ words.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「It can’t do that to dead people. But no matter how serious the condition, one can recovered almost immediately. It’s rare to find a disease or injury that can’t be cured by a bottle of that stuff.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s true that it’s a very rare drug, isn’t it? I heard you could buy an entire small town if you wanted to buy the elixir.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I heard that’s how much it costs now. I think I’m the only one in the world who knows how to make it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You can make it, Anorn?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Do you understand now how great I am?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris thought that Anorn was amazing in many ways, even if she couldn’t make such thing, but she didn’t say anything about it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But we just don’t have the ingredients anymore. That’s because of the people who get the materials&mdash; And I guess I’m off topic.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn scratched her head and continued.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So, in my village, it’s all about developing medicine. I was given my own workshop when I was seven, and I did research a lot. Then, was when I was thirteen? My grandmother collapsed. She said it was just her life expectancy, but I couldn’t accept it… So I foolishly started researching how to extend life. It’s a childish idea, isn’t it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No it’s not…」</p>


<p class="calibre6">She was about to say something, but Anorn stopped her with her hand.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s all right. So, I’ve been holed up in my workshop for months. It was a strange thing, but I was really able to create a potion that slightly extends one’s life. I guess I had a talent for making medicine. I was so happy that I went outside with the medicine to give it to my grandma. And then…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn suddenly looked at her darkly.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Everyone… they were killed.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Wha&mdash; How? Who did?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t know.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn shook her head.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Our medicine was a money tree for us. I knew we had a lot of enemies but I didn’t know how many it was. I was still treated like a child, so I didn’t know the details. It was a laughingstock. They were all being killed on top of a workshop where they were working on a drug that would extend their lives. I was angry that they were slaughtered, but more than that, I was scared. I tried to ask for help, but it seemed like the whole world was against me… I was so ashamed that I retreated to my workshop.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「In the workshop?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yeah. The workshop was big enough to be self-sufficient, and mine was so deep underground that it seemed like the only safe place to me. They never found me in the first place. So I started thinking,『I should just bring back everyone back to life.』I must have gone crazy somehow…」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Anorn continued to talk in an indifferent manner.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I didn’t even know how long it had been. I made all kinds of medicines and tested them on myself. Sometimes I made something like a poison and almost died… I wished I could just die, but I was stubborn than I thought. One time, I went into another room to get some plants to use as ingredients, and I found a dead plant. I think it had a lifespan of about 30 years. Then I thought, 『I’m going to be an old lady before I know it,』so I looked into the mirror. I remembered that hadn’t seen anyone since I’ve been holed up in my workshop, and I hadn’t looked at my own face once. I thought I would get a good laugh out of it, because I must have looked terrible, but my face looked like I was in my twenties.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was speechless.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「At first, I didn’t understand what was going on. I thought I looked this even in my 40s, but I thought it was strange that I didn’t have a single wrinkle, so I didn’t think anything of it at that time. But one day, I accidentally ignited an explosive device. And it was right in front of me. I was blown to pieces… I should have been.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ahh, I was dead. Now I can go to my family and everyone else. I thought my life was so boring. But after a while, I woke up without a scratch on me. My clothes were ragged and my workshop was a mess. That’s when I realized something. I had become immortal.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why did it happen…?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t know either. I don’t know if it was one of I made or if it was the order of consumption. In any case, because of the explosion, the results of my research were burned, so I couldn’t verify them. Oh, but immortality isn’t like the undead who are forced by magic to move, so they can’t functionally move if their heads are cut off, nor can they starve. It’s not like they can create unlimited amounts of energy on their own. I guess it’s the same if I freeze myself, I can’t move. My immortality may be more like『returning to my best state.』</p>

<p class="calibre6">Besides, I’m as hungry as anyone else, and I need to sleep to keep my strength up. But I didn’t want to be immortal, so I tried everything to die, but when I couldn’t kill myself by swallowing a combustible bomb, I gave up on dying.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I can’t even do that…」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Alfiris looked sad. It must been a very desperate time in her life for the cheerful Anorn &ndash; or at least that’s what Alfiris thinks &ndash; to go drive her that far.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I could have done a lot of other things, but… I don’t like torturing myself too much, and I’ve decided that this is just like heaven telling me to live. I was a bit interested in the outside world, and I was a ne’er-do-well by nature. So I gathered up what I could in the village and set out on my journey. It’s been decades since I’ve been there, so I figured no one would know I was a survivor of that village.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「And so, I started working as a mercenary. I had some self-defense skills, so I thought I could handle it. I was so excited to be immortal, and I didn’t know know at that time how scary it would be to be immortal without any skills. I was just like you in the beginning, Alfie.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「? Just like me?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">When Alfiris cocks her head, Anorn speaks a little mockingly.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You’re like a duck carrying a leek.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Harsh!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, you’re actually right. You’re a lone female adventurer, and you walk into a town and ask a passing man, 『Where can I stay for the night?』You know what I went through after that, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn didn’t dare to say anything, but Alfiris could easily imagine what she meant. The same goes for Alfiris.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It was in the first village she visited after starting her adventure. She approached a man in the area to confirm the location of the next village. The man, who was strangely kind, even bought her and his friends dinner, and politely offered them alcohol. Alfiris had never drunk alcohol before, and she didn’t know what was the right amount for her, so she drank as she was offered. In a daze, she vaguely remembers what the men were saying to each other.</p>

<p class="calibre6">(Hey, you’re trying to scare traveling girls again… Heaven will punish you someday, right guys?)</p>
<p class="calibre6">(Heh heh heh… If it was going to happen, it would have happened by now. Women are such a bunch of idiots… they follow men and drink alcohol when they travel alone.)</p>

<p class="calibre6">(Yeah, yeah, it’s her ignorance which was the problem. We’re just trying to be nice and show her how hard the world is…)</p>
<p class="calibre6">(Damn, you bastards. Why don’t you go visit the land of the dead for once?)</p>
<p class="calibre6">(What kind of shopkeeper mixes a numbing agent in her liquor while he’s saying that… I’m sure he’s planning to take it easy on us after we leave, you stingy old man.)</p>
<p class="calibre6">(I’m renting a room at the inn, you know. I’m just taking the money for it.)</p>
<p class="calibre6">(That’s no excuse… I’ll just rent on the back)</p>
<p class="calibre6">(They’re watching us too. Are you sure?)</p>
<p class="calibre6">(They’re watching. She’s a rare gem around here. They’ve been watching her a lot, haven’t they?)</p>
<p class="calibre6">(I’m sure you’re not the only one. If you piss off a mage, you’ll be afraid of the consequences.)</p>
<p class="calibre6">(I don’t care. I can’t resist anymore.)</p>
<p class="calibre6">(I don’t know… should we do it then?)</p>
<p class="calibre6">(Ahh!)</p>
<p class="calibre6">(Wait&mdash; Stop!)</p>

<p class="calibre6">From that point on, Alfiris’ memory was hazy. She vaguely heard the screams of the men and the sounds of the building collapsing.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When she woke up, she found a beautiful blond-haired sister looking at her face with a worried look on her own. Afterwards, she vividly remembered being lectured for hours in a hangover state. She also remembered the battered men and the wreckage of the inn, which was destroyed to the point of tipping over.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Yes, she had been saved in the nick of time by Anorn, but surely Anorn had not come to anyone’s aid, Alfiris imagined.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So when I first saw you, you didn’t feel like a stranger. I thought you were just like me when I first met you. I had seen a lot of pain and learned a lot of things, but it was not a good experience. I didn’t want you to go through the same thing, as a woman of your age.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Anorn…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t look so bitter. Thanks to you, I’ve become stronger. I’ve trained a lot, and I’m ready to do it. I’ve done a lot of dirty things. I’m not afraid to cheat people. People use and are used, I thought. I really thought that people who were used were stupid. Of course, there were a lot of good guys, you know? There were places where they treated me well and I was able to live a very peaceful life, but even so, I couldn’t stay in one place for long. I don’t age, and I don’t die. When I didn’t change my appearance over the years, people around me started to get creeped out. There were times when I was called a monster… and then I met some people.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn’s eyes suddenly became gentle.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It was almost 150 years ago, wasn’t it? There were still a lot of Archfiends back then. It’s not as bad as it was during the Great War, because most of them were conquered, but there were a lot of human conflicts that we couldn’t handle, and there were a number of Archfiends that expanded their power as if to weave in and out of the conflicts. It’s not as if they are small in historical terms, but it was a time when the archfiends were temporarily regaining power, and the world was in turmoil.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In the midst of all this, there was a group of people who were taking on a task of defeating fiends for free. They were what is commonly called the『Hero’s Group.』 They were a combination of a Hero, a Fighter, a Sister, and a Sorceress. At first I thought,『Are they nuts?』I was already as strong as I am now. I’ve recruited some of the kids from around the area to fight for me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「And then…?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「They were beaten to a pulp. All four of them were so strong that they were like monsters. In particular, the strength of the Hero was exceptional. I was twisted with one hand. I’m sure they’ve been recognized as heroes many countries.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Really?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">How much of a warrior could he be to singlehandedly twist Anorn to drive back a pack of Orcs unharmed? Alfiris couldn’t even imagine it, but she’s sure that it can compete with Albert. But he could not compare to Alfiris, who had not yet reached that level. Anorn shrugged her shoulders and made a joke, as if to show that she could not believe it herself.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「It’s true, like a lie. It was the hardest thing for me to believe, but what’s more unbelievable happened afterwards.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What did he say?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「『Please join me, I need your help. Let’s save the world together!』He said. I thought he was stupid, hot, and depressing. I reasoned that『if you were that strong, you wouldn’t need my help.』But I don’t have anything else to do, and I wanted to see where his skin would come off, so I decided to follow him.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris giggled.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What’s with that?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But Anorn, you’re so twisted.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s the truth, you know. I’ve been to a lot of places and had a lot of adventure.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn began to talk happily. It was a change from earlier.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I really enjoyed those days. At first, I thought he was a fool, but he was really a saintly man. He never asked for anything in return from anyone, but kept fighting and always overcame any hardship. And yet, he was never arrogant. He was the kind of guy who would go to stop a kid’s fight and come back with a beating of his own. But I knew that this was the kind of man who was really strong. In time… I fell in love with him without even knowing it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「No matter how I approached him, he didn’t seem to notice me at all, so one day I went to crawl into his bedroom at night.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Can I ask what happened?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Right. I stood in front of him sleeping in his bed, not wearing a single piece of cloth, and I seduced him. What do you think he said? 『W-we can’t do it! You and I aren’t lovers, so I don’t think you should do that! Hurry up ans put your clothes on!』he said. I couldn’t hold back and burst out laughing!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Isn’t that too much to ask? You’re the one who started it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris, who had been expecting a good story, was a little taken aback.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s because you’re like an adult, but your face is so red, you’re reacting like a boy who’s seem a girl naked for the first time. I couldn’t help but ask,『So, would you mind if I were your girlfriend?』 I told him. He froze for a while and then said,『If it’s okay for an insignificant person like me to be around a beautiful soul like you…!』I’ve had many compliments ony appearance, but he may have been the first to look into my heart. I knew then that I would follow him for the rest of my life.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn speaks while blushing like a girl. The fact that she really liked him was painfully evident to Alfiris.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Then we became proper lovers… a lot happened, but after a while, he asked me, 『Will you marry me?』He proposed to me. But I turned him down. After all, I’m immortal. If we get married, people will eventually find out about it. I couldn’t tell him the truth because I was afraid that if he found out about my immortality, it would destroy our relationship. I guess I didn’t want to ruin our current happiness. That was my mistake in the first place, though.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But he was very patient. I thought he was going to reject me, but he said, 『If you don’t want to get married, I won’t force you. But I want to be with you forever.』『So you can quit your job as a hero?』I begged and pleaded, but he immediately said…『If that’s what you want.』」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I couldn’t say no if he said so. I was genuinely happy. After that, we lived alone together for about six months, in a remote area where people didn’t know he was a hero. He started to work as a teacher in a nearby village, and I waited for his return every day while plowing the fields. We took a day off once a week to go places together, and he made love with me every day… the best time of my life. But at the same time, I was in deep despair. I realized that I was incapable of bearing a child.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn’s eyes clouded over.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I was actually going to accept the marriage. But I found out about it before I got married… I guess it’s the price of immortality. I couldn’t tell him the truth even after six months. But he was always smiling, and that made it harder and harder for me. It was at that moment, after a long time, that we received a request to take down the Archfiend. I was reluctant at first, but our comrades came at us. Apparently, it was quite powerful, and several kingdoms had already been destroyed, and the strongest knight order around had been defeated. So they gathered the remnants and asked us to join them in a counter-offensive.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Did you go?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yeah, he couldn’t say no. More like he had no choice, it was because it’s his birthplace. But it was already a trap from the Archfiend. As a result, we ended up rushing into the Archfiend’s stronghold with only our own people.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s absurd!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Alfiris yelped, but Anorn closed her eyes, unperturbed. She remembered that at the same time, she had shouted the same line as Alfiris.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s right, it was reckless by normal standards, but we didn’t intend to lose in the slightest. There were so many fiends waiting for us inside that we didn’t even bother to count them, but we defeated them one by one. The Archfiend must have miscalculated our strength. But we had also underestimated the Archfiend. We never thought that there would be more than one Archfiend.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「There are other… Archfiends?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yeah, six in total. All of them were stronger than the creepy one we fought earlier. At that time, the Hero was so strong that some of the Archfiends felt they were in danger and temporarily joined forces together. Even so, he defeated them one after another, but our comrades also fell one after another. And in the end, it came down to me, him, and two remaining Archfiends.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I was completely staggered by the intensity of the battle. So even though it was supposed to be one against two, he still had the upper hand in the fight. That’s when the Archfiends pulled a cowardly stunt amd caught us off guard. I tried to defend him, but for a moment, I didn’t want to know about my immortality, and that interfered with my movements.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn’s eyes darken and sink deeper.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But he… he died defending me without any hesitation. And his last words were 『I’m sorry I couldn’t protect you in the end』! I don’t need to be protected to die, and I should have been the one to protect him!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris had no words to say. Anorn began to have tears in her eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I killed the Archfiends myself. I shattered them alive so that not a trace of them remained. But I was just empty. After that, I got desperate and hunted down every fiend I could find. One day, I hunted another Archfiend. After the battle, when I was so exhausted that I couldn’t move at all, I was picked up the current Master Bishop of the Church of Arnelia. But even after that, I was powerless and had no motivation to do anything. I tried to die on my own and tried to do all kinds of desperate things, but Master wouldn’t let me. I didn’t care about my life anymore, and I was thinking of getting ordained in earnest, it was when I met that guy from the Lazaar family at church.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「In contrast to the Hero, he was frivolous. I remember he touched my butt as soon as we met. I slapped him, no, I beat him to a pulp, but he came back the next day and sexually harassed me as if nothing had happened. But he didn’t mind messing with other women… He was annoying that I got angry every time I saw him.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But it was strange. I felt like I was missing something without him. I wondered if be liked me. But then, one day, he suddenly married another woman. Do you know what he said to me then? 『Oh, no, I’m sorry! I’m tired of you!』I punched him in the face as hard as I could and went straight to the pilgrimage mission that I had been told about. I was so angry and annoyed every time I remembered him during the trip. But for some reason, in all the 118 years of my pilgrimage, I never forgot his face… I just found out why.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was listening to the conversation while staring at Anorn. Suddenly, Anorn began to shake and tremble.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Albert just showed me his journal… He wrote, 『Dedicated to the only Sister in my life whom I love with all my heart.』He was fascinated by me from the first glance. The way I look to him, I looked like I was asking for help. No matter how many times he was dying on the battlefield, every time he remembered my face, it gave him energy to live. Whenever he saw me looking lonely. I was angry at myself for not being able to do anything about it. He was always trying to distract me, even if I hated him, so that I wouldn’t look so lonely. He regretted that he could not stay my side until the end of his life in order to preserve his offspring. He also apologized for not being able to tell his wife and his mistresses that he loved them with all his heart. I was&mdash; I&mdash;!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Finally, large tears began to spill from Anorn’s eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I didn’t understand anything! I didn’t know how much he cared, he suffered, how much I really loved him! Whenever I remembered his face, he would always, always smile! In front of me, no matter how much pain he was in, he always cared for me first and foremost, and never showed any sign of pain. And yet… I’ve been seeing him for almost two years without saying a single kind word to him, and to top it off, I said, 『I never want to see your face again!』I’ve said something terrible… to him… I’m was… awful…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Tears were rolling down from Anorn’s cheeks and she could not stop them. Anorn thinks her face must have look awful, but she can’t stop her tears, and she doesn’t want to stop it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Now that he’s dead, for the first time I felt truly sad. I’ve been lying to everyone around me and to myself for a long time, and I’m sure Alfie would despise me for being such a horrible person. But I can’t help it…)」</p>


<p class="calibre6">And then, softly, Alfiris hugged Anorn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Al… fie…?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris puts more strength into the hands that hold Anorn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You don’t have to hold back anymore, do you Anorn?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t have to hold back… is it okay?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Isn’t okay for humans to cry at times like this?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But I’m not human…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’re human, and also you’re my friend.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Uuuuuhh… Uwaaaaahhh!!!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn didn’t know what her face looked like anymore, or what she was screaming right now&mdash; but she wanted to cry until she felt better. Right now, she just wanted to cry in front of her friend who were there for her like this&mdash;. She wondered when was the last time she had cried like this…</p>


<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">She don’t know how long has it been, but Anorn still hasn’t stopped crying. She was still sad, and she would probably have regrets in the future. But there is also a part of her that wants to see things with Alfiris in front of her. The look on Alfiris’ face right now is so peaceful…</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Yes, all the people I loved had this expression on their faces… When I see Alfie like that, I naturally start to feel tender…)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn wiped away her tears with her hands and turned to Alfiris.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m sorry, Alfie. I cried a lot.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s okay. I want to support you sometimes, too. I’ve always been supported by you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Isn’t that the wrong word for annoyance?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I guess you could say that.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn poked Alfiris.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Oh, you’re hurting me! You’re using too much force, you should be more gentle!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Is that what you say to a weak maiden?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…You’re back to your normal self, aren’t you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Anorn was momentarily taken aback.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I can’t tell which one of us is older than the other. I’m not sure if she’s really 18 or not…)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn looks at Alfiris with a slightly suspicious gaze, when Alfiris saw her, she had a question mark floating in her mind.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Good grief… I guess I’m losing today. Also, I’d like you to call me by my real name.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Can I do that in front of everyone?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t mind. Well… I don’t have to use my fake name anymore! It’s an alias I was given because I didn’t want to be called by my own name. Do you know where it comes from? It’s a wordplay from the ancient word 『Announ = Unknown』. It’s not a good name, and it’s not appropriate at all. But I’ll use my real name from now on! But I’ll only tell you my full name in secret.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Heeh, it’s a maiden’s secret, huh?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Not exactly, okay? My full name is…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn, or rather Miranda, whispered her name to Alfiris. Then she blew her ear, causing her scream and Miranda to burst out laughing. After that, the girls didn’t stop laughing for a while.</p>


<p class="calibre6">And then…</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well, well, well! That brat finally got over it! I’m really worried her. I guess that’s what it’s like to have a little sister or daughter who takes a lot of worries.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The one who was watching exactly what was going on through the messenger was Millie, the Master Bishop of Arnelia Church, Miliazar.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「As long as Alfiris is alive, we no longer have to worry. No, will that amount be enough to cover the loss of Alfiris?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">While nodding, Miliazar is convinced.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「After all, she’s got… well, I guess it’s just a matter of what the brat does. I’m going to take care of my own business first. I hope I can catch some goodies today.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As the sun was setting and the city of Mysia was turning golden, Miliazar began to walk along, muttering to herself. No one knew what was going through her mind as she sighed, looking into the distance.</p>
