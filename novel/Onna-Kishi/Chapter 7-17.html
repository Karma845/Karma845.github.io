<p class="calibre6">○ History</p>

<p class="calibre6">The history of human beings has only been in existence for about 1500 years. Before that time, humans existed, but they were not accustomed to keeping records of their existence, and their area of living was very limited, being found only along the east and west coasts and in parts of the central plains of the continent where the protagonists are now. There are three major continents that have been discovered, and while the eastern continent has been found to have a human race with a different culture, there is little evidence of a human race living in the southern continent.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Fifteen hundred years ago, the Archfiends held the supremacy of the continent, and the struggle for supremacy was mainly between them. It is said that there were several hundred Archfiends in existence during that time. In a broader sense, an Archfiend is a fiend that unifies fiends across races, but in a narrowed sense, an Archfiend can also be a being who follows many fiends, or a being who had extraordinary power, even though they are alone.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Humans, elves, fairies, and some giants, who were in the minority at that time, cooperated with each other, and it is said that the papermaking and recording techniques were introduced to humans at that time. It is also said that the human race was superior ti other races in that they were greedy for survival and learning, and took in the advantages of other races one after another. The elves taught magic and languages, the faeries taught herbalism and natural science, the dwarves taught iron making and construction, and the giants taught martial arts and combat. In addition, humans are highly diverse, with a wide range of attributes and characteristics depending on the individual, and their resistance to environmental changes is a major advantage. For example, spirits with the attribute of water would have easily become extinct if they were forced to leave their watery habitats, but humans were able to survive by digging wells and drawing water.</p>

<p class="calibre6">It is said that the first time humans started to fight back was about 1200 years ago. A young man named Dayadan, who was a close of the giant race, was the first to succeed in conquering the Archfiend. This fact was quickly communicated to the entire continent through the fairy information network, making people realize that the Archfiends were not immortal, but an existence that humans could defeat. At this stage, the Archfiends were still underestimating the humans, and there was no sense of cooperation among the Archfiends themselves, so looking back on history, the Archfiends were behind the curve.</p>

<p class="calibre6">In addition, about 1,000 years ago, the concept of a nation was established among humans, and the nations that fought against the Archfiends in groups began to form. The Archfiends realized that the situation was bad at this point, but only half of them tried to make countermeasures and tbe other half were engaged in a struggle among the Archfiends. The humans took advantage of this gap, and with the help of Sigmund, the king of elves, and Fard, the king giants, they defeated the Archfiends who seemed to be aware of the threats posed by the humans. In this era many heroes appeared one after another, including the legendary hero king Graham, and the sword emperor Titania and the brave Zebeire.</p>


<p class="calibre6">In the past 700 years, humans have expanded their territory to cover half of the continent. In addition, organization such as Church of Arnelia and the Sorcerous Society have appeared, actively taking the roles as mediators between nations. The number of Archfiends was reduced to about 100, but yhe remaining ones were the mostly powerful, and the six especially Archfiends were called『Great Archfiends.』</p>

<p class="calibre6">This battle ended in total victory for the humans who annihilated the Great Archfiends, but the spirits and giants were exhausted by the successive battles and gradually disappeared from the stage of history. Many of the Archfiends who survived came to live in hiding so that they would not be discovered by humans, and the power structure between humans, fiends, and Archfiends was completely reversed. The only difference between the Archfiends and the humans is that the Archfiends do not know how to cooperate even when they have other species in their ranks, so the war naturally becomes a『us versus them』situation, and it is no longer possible to reverse the position.</p>

<p class="calibre6">However, following the defeat of the last Great Archfiend, which marked the end of the Great War Period, conflicts broke out among human nations. In this era, cooperation between nations and groups faded, and the Church of Arnelia and the Church of Magic remained neutral. In the midst of this, the Church of Olympus was established in the west, and from then on, it was with the Church of Arnelia in the east. In addition, various branches of the Church of Magic were established, and oversight became insufficient.</p>

<p class="calibre6">In this era, the hundreds of small nations that had been stered throughout the world were unified into the dozens of nations we know today, and this is known as the『Dawn Period.』It is said that this period ended about 20 years ago, which is a very recent development. The reason for the end of the Dawn Period was the emergence of an Archfiend among the humans, which led to a series of wars involving multiple nations. These include the war of the usurper king Bramsel, the forbidden war of the sorcerer kind Herhold, the rebellion of the bandit Yapu, and the rebellion of the slave gladiator Zasamund. It was also during this period that the beastmen began to claim their own state. In any case, these wars exhausted the nations, and a feeling of war weariness grew. The Church of Arnelia and the Church of Magic acted as go-betweens, leading to the conclusion of a peace agreement between the countries.</p>

<p class="calibre6">After this process, we are now in what is called the 『Peace Period,』where each country sends a representative to hold a peace conference once a year. However, no one knows how long this era will last, and many point out that it may be as fragile as walking on thin ice. Even historians are calling the past two decades『too quiet.』</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 8 &#8211; New Ally (1)</strong></p>

<p class="calibre6">「I see. I was almost attacked by Alfie, you know?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Please, stop it!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn muttered as she loaded her luggage into the wyvern.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But I thought Alfie would be okay with it… just kidding. Hey, why is everyone walking away from me?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I didn’t know Onee-sama were from that side… I’ll stop calling you Onee-sama after today.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa slunk away first. As for Alfiris, she backed away in silence. Albert took out a piece of paper and a pen from her pocket.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Hmm, hmm, I see. Anorn-dono prefers women than men…and」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hey, Albert. What are you writing?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m writing a document for the church.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You don’t have to write anything!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m under strict orders to report everything in full.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Guh. You should at be flexible.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, it’s my duty as a knight.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If I were that person, I would never to do that to you, you know? …Alfie? Where are you going?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Iyaa&mdash;, don’t touch me!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Huh! You as well?!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…By the way, if you touch Lisa… I will cut you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What are you doing with that sword?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">There was a lot of commotion.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Being a member in this group isn’t so bad… but I guess I’ll have to travel with them until I get back to Mysia. It’s nice to travel alone with Anorn, but it would be great to have more companions on the road. Lisa is also a good girl for some reason.)」</p>


<p class="calibre6">But, at the moment when Alfiris was so deep into her feelings, Lisa kicked Alfiris towards the pursuing Anorn who was chasing her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…I take back that consideration! Stop, Lisa!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s not my fault you’re in a daze, you giantess.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You&mdash;!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hahaha, Alfie, I got you!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">After that, Alfiris was caught by Anorn and tickled her until her abdominal muscles reach their limit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">The group then arrived in Mysia. The sun had not set yet and the city had not yet shown its night face.</p>
<p class="calibre6">On the way back, the progress was even faster due to the fact that Alfiris was driving the wyvern. They seemed to have gotten the hang of going faster in a vertical line, and Miranda, who was holding the reins of the wyvern behind her, was almost scared out of her wits. She finished her meal easily on top of the wyvern, and it would have taken less than three minutes. It was an amazingly fast pace.</p>
<p class="calibre6">To everyone’s surprise, Alfiris was communicating with the wyvern, the wyvern with the「Ku?」and 「Kukua!」, she was imitating the sound which the wyvern is making. The people around her couldn’t understand what they were doing.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Then, Anorn suggested that they should have a「victory celebration for tonight」, so they decided to have dinner together.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Then Lisa will go home. I’ll be back here in seventh bell in the evening.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m going to report to Sister Millie foremost.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Once Lisa and Albert had left, Alfiris and Anorn had nothing to do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What shall we do, Anorn?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Anorn?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「……」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ano… Miranda?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What is it~?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn, but, Miranda looks back at her with a very nice smile.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「You should call me by my real name!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But I’ve been calling you by your real name since days ago. But it’s still confusing.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Muh&mdash;. Well, maybe you’re right. I’m responsible for it too, so I’ll spare you for the embarrassing punishment game.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「(And you’re still going for it…)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris is somewhat stunned. Miranda looks at her with concern.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So, Alfie. Is your right hand alright?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Did you know?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m sure everyone noticed. You’re clearly protecting your right hand. It must been the spell…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yeah, I think it was a reaction. I might be able to handle daily life, but I might not be able to wield a sword for a least two or three days.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s quite painful. If that’s the case when you’re traveling, you’re in a lot of danger, and you really shouldn’t use the spell mark for anything. You should consult with me before using it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Thank you… umm, Miranda?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmm! You’re quite honest!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miranda smiles at her. Not wanting to worry Miranda, Alfiris decided to keep quiet about the fact of erosion of the spell had progressed a bit.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So, what do we now? Miranda.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Let’s find a place to make some noise. We can’t go to the guild after all.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You’re more considerate than I what thought, you know?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s not, I’d rather see how everyone reacts to us going. Rather, I feel more sorry for Lisa. She’s going to have to live in this town with the mess I made.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see. So… Lisa’s not coming with us, is she?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I agree with you as well. But she’s stubborn and I don’t think she’ll once we start reasoning with her.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It sounds like there’s something going on, but can’t we help her?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s the thing. At least, Lisa has to say something to us. I think it would be counterproductive to ask her about it. She’s pretty stubborn and proud girl.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">While pondering, the two of them came up with a plan, but there was nothing they could do when they didn’t know what was the problem in the first place.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Let’s find a place to eat first. Alfie, do you any idea where we can go?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「There’s coming to my mouth yet… Ahh! There’s one!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">When they arrived in Mysis, Alfiris remembered the beastman who approached her. Alfiris decided to go and check it out.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>


<p class="calibre6">「You’re back, Albert.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, I have returned, Miliazar-sama.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">This was Miliazar’s inn. Miliazar is busily writing a letter.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「How it’d go?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’ve been watching them with your own eyes, haven’t you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「To some extent, yes. What I want to ask you is, what do you think of Alfiris? That’s what I want to know.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Me? Then…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert asked her back, but it seemed to Miliazar that it sounded suspicious.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Don’t be silly. Why do you think I attached a bunch of slow-moving people to an Archfiend that you alone can defeat. It’s because that I want to witness if you can kill Alfiris when she gets out of control.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t know if I could have slained the Archfiend by myself.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Such humbleness. The members of the investigation team are not stupid. I’ve received their reports, and I’m sure you’ve heard at least the outline. In fact, you received the first report from the other side as well, right? If you’re the one who took Alfiris and the others to defeat them, then you must have thought that you could manage on your own. It is a fact that defeating the Archfiend is the top priority, no matter what.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s for sure. I just didn’t mean for Lady Miranda to get hurt.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert lowered his eyes. Miliazar hesitated for a moment, wondering what to say to him.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Don’t worry about it. It is true that this was your first battle against an Archfiend. Not everything will go well.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes. But, that’s not good enough for me. Besides, you don’t care about Miranda-sama, do you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m curious about that… I’m not in a position to be concerned to the sisters. Well, if you have any points to reflect on, make use of them next time. But we’ll get back to it. What do you think of Alfiris in your point of view?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar’s eyes were sharp. She seemed to be asking seriously.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…If I do it now, I will not be defeated. However, if Alfiris-dono comes to kill me with all her might, I will only be in a predicament.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Is that all to it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s swords and magic, after all. I use a little magic myself, but her magic is extraordinary. Didn’t you seen it, Master?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, it was when Alfiris released the power of the spell that her thoughts were disturbed. I did see how she defeated it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It was a triple blow of magic that Archfiend had no time to resist. I’m not an expert magic, but I think she used a very high level of magic.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmm, well, Aldreus seals it with a spell, so I guess she’ll do that much. So, what do you think if I were to fight Alfiris?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miriazar asked rather nastily. But Albert thought about it seriously, and…</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Alfiris-dono may be stronger than you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar was surprised by this reply. Inwardly, Miliazar thought that this might be a possibility, but she was nervous when others told her that.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What makes you think that?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「When she twisted the Archfiend, she still didn’t seem to be at full strength. If she goes on a rampage without thinking about her surroundings or her own future, it may be questionable whether there is anyone in the world who can stop her alone. She might lose her life in return.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I can’t believe I let you tell me that much…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s not normal, especially with that killing power. I’ve had Miliazar-sama show me her full power in the past, and though you may have more experience in combat, she may have more output. To be honest, I felt my legs tremble at Alfiris-dono releasing the spell mark.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Miliazar crossed her arms involuntarily, muttering, and began to think.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Why someone with that much power was left unnoticed from birth… I may need to look into this in detail. It’s a shame, but I’ll need to meet with the head of the Church of Magic.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar thought of the face of the representative of the Church of Magic. He was not a person she liked, but it was good to know that he was not an enemy of his own. Miliazar thinks that the matter of Alfiris might develop into a problem that cannot be left unattended. Or maybe it was already too late.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Miliazar-sama, will she be fine being left alone?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What? Are you thinking it would be better to cut her down?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I personally don’t like it, Miliazar-sama. But, your orders take precedence over everything else.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s what you said with such a disapproving look on your face. I’m not giving you such an absurd order like that. I just thought it was better to be prepared for anything. For example, fighting Miranda and Alfiris.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That may be so, but…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar grins at Albert, who obeys with his mouth but puts on a rather dissatisfied face. Apparently, Albert also likes Alfiris.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「There’s something I need to get to before you get too excited. Follow me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「As you wish.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar walked out with Albert.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 9 &#8211; Biology</strong></p>

<p class="calibre6">Today’s introduction to the world is about creatures and races. This is just a rough description, so please don’t worry about it. Of course, creatures not listed here will eventually here.</p>

<p class="calibre6">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre6">In this world, there are not only humans, but also spirits, fairies, demihumans, phantoms, magical beasts, and fiends. Nevertheless, the delimitation between them is mainly determined by humans, and their boundaries and perceptions vary from species to species.</p>
<p class="calibre6">For example, in Alfiris’ world, there are dogs, s, horses just like in our world, but there are also animals that look identical but are obviously larger. Humans call those species that do not harm humans as 「phantoms,」 while those who attack humans are called「magical beasts.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">Of course, their behavior differs depending on their living conditions and the time, place, occasion, so there will be times when some are recognized as fiends but do not attack humans, and times when phantoms attack humans. It is the same for demihumans and fairies, but it is almost certain that only fiends will clearly act hostile to humans. Rather, fiends are not limited to humans, and depending on the situation, even their own kind will kill each other without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">However, considering that humans also fight wars between nations, it may be that we are the ones who appears to be「fiends」to the beings we call「fiends.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">○ Species</p>

<p class="calibre6">(1) Spirits</p>

<p class="calibre6">Spirits, as the name of the magic type implies, are said to be beings that control the elements. Based on the basic elemental thinking of this world, they are distinguished as fire, wind, earth, water, gold, light, gold and unclassifiable.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Each of them is said to have a ruling spirit, like with the Salamander of fire and the Undine of water being representative, but they are said to be visible only on rare occasions. Some of them are treated as「gods,」but their names vary from place to place, and their chanting may differ even in the same magic. Perhaps because of that, there are two types of magic systems: spirit magic, which seeks to negotiate with the spirits and borrow their power; and physical magic, which directly manipulates the elements. The former is often used by those who are deeply religious, while the latter is used by those who pursue magic as a form.</p>


<p class="calibre6">(2) Fairies</p>
<p class="calibre6">They are said to be messengers of spirits, but they are one of the species that make up the ecosystem. Some of them are actually spirits. While some of the fairies are relatively friendly to humans, nymphs are generally exclusive fairies. In a broader sense, goblins and elves are considered to be a kind of fairy, but in this world, fairies tend to be palm-sized species, and goblins and elves are often recognized as demihumans.</p>


<p class="calibre6">(3) Demihumans</p>
<p class="calibre6">They are represented by elves, a species that is similar in appearance to human, but is definitely different from humans. Elves for example, have pointed ears and live about three times as long as humans. They also have considerably more magical power than humans on average, but their physical strength is somewhat inferior. They are a race that has sided with humans at times, but they remain neutral and are considered to be a race with little emotion. There is also a race of brown-skinned elves that humans named Dark Elves, but this is a nuisance to them, and there are many races among them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In addition, there is a race called Beastmen, which often have an appearance somewhere between dogs, s, and horses, which humans have long treated as livestocks, and humans.</p>
<p class="calibre6">On the other hand, there are other races such as goblins, orcs and some of the giant tribes, many of which act hostile towards human. They are often cooperative with the Archfiend, who will be discussed later, and they also like to attack other races. Their intelligence is even lower than that of a beastmen, and they are very faithful to their three major appetites: desire to sleep, hunger, and sexual desire.</p>


<p class="calibre6">(4) Phantoms • Magical Beasts</p>
<p class="calibre6">Appearance varies, but some species, such as the Forest Wolf are similar in appearance to normal wolves, differing only in size, while others, such as the nue and griffin, exhibit characteristics of multiple animals. Some species that are more familiar to humans are the amma and the dragon. Unlike wyverns, there are also dragons that understand human languages, but it is generally believed that only a few of them still exists.</p>



<p class="calibre6">(5) Fiends</p>
<p class="calibre6">It generally refers to species that are hostile to everything but themselves. In a broad sense, goblins and orcs are also classified here, but unlike goblins and orcs, fiends are generally highly intelligent, and it is not uncommon for them to use magic. Among them, those who show outstanding abilities and have the ability to unite other races are called 「Archfiends」and「Great Archfiends,」and are the object of fear not only for humans but for all races. Some fiends have an appearance similar to that of humans.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 10 &#8211; New Ally (2)</strong></p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m back.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ahh, it’s Lisa-neechan!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「「「Welcome home!」」」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「How have you been, you pipsqueaks?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Thomas peed his pants. It was a big problem.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What’s wrong with you for picking on Thomas?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, you’re just a little stingy~」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Fuaahh! Nelly took my doll!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hey, I did just borrow it!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa’s house is in uproar. But, it’s not exactly her house. This is just a vacant house she’s borrowing without permission. None of tbe neighbors or landowners complained, as Lisa had a firm grip on beforehand. She even fudged the town’s household registration. The fact that people are annoyed with her is often heard by Lisa, but it is also true that there is nothing anyone can do about it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There are about nine orphans living here, none older than Lisa. Jake, the next oldest after Lisa, was ten years, and Thomas, the youngest, was only four. After all, Lisa herself was an orphan, so it was inevitable.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa was desperate to fulfill the request because she needed to feed them. At first, she picked up Jake, but as the years went by, the number of people grew. As a result, Lisa’s income gradually became insufficient to keep up with their needs. It is the reason why Lisa approached Alfiris and company that time was because there was a possibility of a large sum. Otherwise, Lisa would not be a gambler to take on such a dubious request.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「For now, I bought something to eat. Lisa is going to be late again tonight, so Jake? Please take care of the little ones.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lisa-nee, are you going to be late again?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I have to make sure I get paid. We’ve done a good work this time and the income will be great.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The children’s faces lit up at Lisa’s words.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Then, can we buy new clothes?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s cheaper if we buy the fabric and make them ourselves!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「The roof got a big leak. That’s our priority first.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「The door’s getting worse as well.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Where are my dolls~?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’ll have bear with it for that!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Uwaah! I want a new doll~!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Alright. I’ll get you a new doll for Milche.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Are you sure, Lisa-nee?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">This was not the kind of conversation that children under the age of ten should be having. Lisa really wanted her children to grow up without any problems, but with her own sensor rank, that was not possible. In addition, it’s hard to earn a lot of money just by searching for people and things.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In fact, she could earn a lot of money by accepting request to leave the city like this, but she was worried about leaving the young children alone for days on end. Also, since she realized that she was a blind woman, and that she was apparently not that bad looking, or even quite desirable if she was not good looking, she had turned down all requests to work with men. She wondered how many times had she cursed herself for not being a man. However, abandoning the kids was also an option that Lisa could never take.</p>
<p class="calibre6">And Milche is waiting for Lisa’s reply, expectantly waiting for her words. As for Lisa, she didn’t want to be the only one would betray the expectations of these children.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Has Lisa ever told you a lie?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Milche shook her head.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So why don’t you be a good kid and wait for me? I’ve taken tomorrow off. Let’s spend time together for the first time after a long while.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lisa-nee at home?! Yay!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m going to ask Lisa-nee to read for me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lisa-nee, let’s play cards with me!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「When did you learn that word, Ruth? Those words are something you can use because it’s『ten years early』to say so you know?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ruth’s getting sick of it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The children were squealing with excitement. Sensing this scene, Lisa couldn’t help smiling. This was the reason why Lisa couldn’t leave the city. But this time, even though she was in dire need and wanted to receive a large reward, she still wondered why she had accepted a dangerous mission such as defeating an Archfiend. She had always avoided it if she smelled any danger, but now she found herself pulling Alfiris’ leg. It was the first time for Lisa to be unable to understand her own actions and feelings.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Every time she saw the smiling faces of the children, she felt a pang in her heart. She didn’t know why she felt it. It was too big for a discomfort to push to the back of her mind.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At that moment, a voice unexpectedly called out from behind her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Oh, so that’s why she works.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Who are you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lisa-dono, I apologize for the sudden visit.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Before she knew it, Albert was standing at the door with the sister. But, from the way he was standing, Albert was being accompanied by the sister.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Who are you that Lisa wasn’t able to notice you until you approached us?)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I apologize for the sudden visit. However, I have something to say to you. If you don’t mind it is.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I don’t think this room is the right place. We’ll go to the back room, Jake, Lisa needs to talk to this sister. It won’t take long, so go and have dinner with others.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Okay.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Seeing the boy named Jake was about to move with the children, Miliazar also Albert to the same.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Albert, take care of the kids.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Understood.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa patter the children’s heads amd urged them to go to the room where they would be eating. She went with the sister to the back room.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So, who are you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m sorry about this. I am Sister Millie. I have come to ask you for a favor. Forgive my sudden visit.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If it’s a legitimate request, why don’t you go through the guild?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’d like you to treat this as a legitimate request, but this can’t go through the guild. I’m willing to give you a cut for the reward.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see, the subjugation of the Archfiend was your request.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’re not a slow learner.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Of course.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The two of them exchanged conversations as if they were trying to figure out what was going on in their guts.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「So, what do you want?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s simple. I want you to accompany Alfiris and Miranda from now on. Semi-permanently. The reward is that I will take care of the little ones here for the rest of their lives.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…You’re a good hostage. Is that more of a threat than a request?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa’s eyes intensified and she turned to look at Miliazar. It’s not that she can actually see her, but she can’t help but to do so out of habit when she wasn’t blind yet.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Here, don’t take things that way. I think think this is an unbeatable condition for you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「How are you going to live without your parents, and possibly without a family register? There may be more children to come. You may have more children, but will you be able to support them with only the request of this town? What if a fire breaks out when you’re not in home again? What if there’s a robbery? What if you die while taking a request again?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The possibility that Miliazar pointed out was not something that Lisa had not considered. But there was no solution, and she tried to avoid thinking about inconvenient things as much as possible. In that respect, Lisa was probably still a child, no matter how she looked.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…You say a lot of nasty things.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But it’s something a head of a family has to think about. It may be good for now. But if you have no education, no family register, and no skills, you will never be able to work properly. As children grow up and their sphere of activity becomes larger, they will learn about the world, they become greedy and they want test themselves. But those children who do not see the light od day will soon be involved in crime. Theft, extortion, prostitution… even murder.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’ve got a lot to say. But Lisa’s not gonna let them do that!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「No, you can’t avoid it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You don’t know what you’re talking about!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa raised her voice unusually.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「The adults cannot be trusted! They abandon and abusechildren for their own reasons. I’ve seen enough of that! Lisa will raise those children once and for all!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But you can’t do that at this point. No major problems seems to be occuring at the moment, but one problem and this kind of life will soon collapse. In fact, it’s such a miracle you guys haven’t fallen apart before.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What do you want me to do then!?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I told you that I will take care of it. I’ve seen what happens to children who don’t have parents. I’ve had enough of that, I won’t tell anything from that. Most of them die in the wild. At best, they are bought as slaves to be used by perverts, or even attacked by fiends and monsters… It’s not good.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Who the hell are you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m sure you know what you are asking about, am I right?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar smiled fearlessly. Lisa hesitated, wondering if she should say anything, but decided that silence is futile.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…At least more than the Bishop of Arnelia. Perhaps you’re the Master Bishop…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Why do you think so? I am dressed like a child?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Albert said, 『Miranda-sama.』It indicatees that he is in a position to use honorifics to a status higher than bishop. But from the way he acted and the way he stood, there didn’t seem to be much of a difference in status. He was just waiting for your orders like a faithful guard dog. That means your position is higher than a bishop’s.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmm, so?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If a person with your chi… presence and this much magic power is only high priest, then Archfiends and fiends should have been abolished from the world. It’s a good thing that I’m not the only one who can’t imagine that the Master Bishop is a fiend.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You know that much? Excellent!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar clapped her hands in admiration. But Lisa had just started to sweat profusely. Maybe that was it. She didn’t understand it at first, but now she knew how strong Miliazar was. It was a byproduct of her battle with the Archfiend. The overwhelming presence of the Archfiend that she fought yesterday was so overwhelming that it is probably just a twist of fate.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The very fact that a fiend of this level existed was already far beyond Lisa’s imagination, and regretted having let such a dangerous being into her home so carelessly.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(W… Wha… Such a tremendous amount of magic and energy! The Archfiend that we fought yesterday is like a child compared to the being in front of me… If this being sees Lisa and the others as enemies, there is no way we can survive. I have to get the little ones out of there, but… If Albert is a knight who is loyal to this person, there’s nothing I can do.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa’s thought were spinning around in her head. But no matter how she thought about it, she could not find a solution. In spite if Lisa’s inner thought, Miliazar continued to speak.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m going to show you my true form. You are the second person alive to see this, after Albert. I’ve never shown it to Miranda. Rejoice, it is usually only shown to those I kill.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">But Lisa no longer heard those words. She directly sensed Miliazar’s swelling spirit. She tried to hold on to her trembling legs, but finally she couldn’t hold on and slumped down on the spot.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ah… Ahh…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Her figure transformed into Miliazar. Her body was covered with golden fur, and her tail grew out. This time, she had not transformed to the point of changing her physiognomy, but her appearance was clearly different from that of a human being.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The slowly approaching Miliazar seemed like a very distant event to Lisa, who was in a daze from being overwhelmed by so much energy. Eventually, Miliazar was right in front of her, and its tail extended and wrapped around around her. Lisa could not move a muscle. The emotion that came to her mind was fear and despair at her inability to protect the children.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Lisa… Is she going to die in a place like this…?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Her thoughts stopped in the face of the overwhelming power, and she could not think of anything. All that was left was the fear of death. She was aware of her tiny self being scared to death, but she have no sense of reality. She wondered this is what it’s like to die. When Lisa thought that,</p>
<p class="calibre6">Something soft…</p>
<p class="calibre6">She patted her on the head. Lisa puzzled over what had happened.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well, doesn’t my tail fell good? I’m quite proud of it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…Hah?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hey, what did you think I was going to do to you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, Lisa don’t know what you mean by that.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「The children should be spoiled by you. But who’s going to spoil you? I think I am someone old enough to be spoiling you.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa’s eyes widened. She had never heard such words before. She have never thought she could be spoiled by anyone. Not even her own parents had allowed her to do so. Something hot was rising in Lisa’s eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Wh… Why…?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmm? No, I’m worried about you because I’ve been watching you through a familiar. In the past, when I was having a difficult time, there was someone who patted me on the head like this. It was a very happy memory for me, if it weren’t for her, I would have been in the position of being called the Archfiend by now. It would have been better if I could stayed by her side for a long time, but unfortunately, she didn’t have that kind of time to live long. Well, I guess that’s the order of things. That’s why I wanted you to know that there is someone watching over you. If you continue like this, you will be ruined sooner than the children. Don’t you think you should live more freely?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「To have more freedom…?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa repeated the words as if she were chewing on them.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「And eventually the children will leave your hands. Those who raise them must take this account. Our role is to make sure that the children become independent. Our roles is to provide them with options so that they can grasp their own future. In order to do that, you have to take charge of your own life first.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I… see…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「By the way, does my tail feel good?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, it’s very…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, it does. Yes, it does.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar smiled proudly. Lisa let her stroke her for a while, but she had a question, so she decided to ask her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I need to ask you something, if that’s okay.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yeah? Well, it depends.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why would a fiend be the head of a church?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa had always thought that fiends were incompatible with humans. It was a common perception throughout the world. She couldn’t believe tthar the head of one of the largest human groups was a fiend.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s a long story, but… well, there’s nothing to hide. I’m a very rare species and all the others have died out. Our pelts and tails are considered to be very valuable. We were also not very powerful as fiends, so we were always targeted by both humans and fiends.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar remembers the past. By the time she was born, the species was already on the brink of extinction.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「That was a long time ago… but I was even more of an outlier. We usually have four tails but I has five. For that reason alone, I was persecuted by my own people. We were so few that there were no more than 100 of us. It’s really boring. Humans and fiends are the same in every world. They fear and despise those who are different from them.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I was chased by my friends, chased by fiends, chased by humans… Before I knew it, I had wandered in a human village, where I had been chased around and had lost my strength. Just when I was ready to give up, a woman came to my defense.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「A human?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar nodded firmly at Lisa’s words.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s right. Although, the concept of magic was not yet widespread at that time, the woman had mastered restorative magic. She was highly valued by the villagers. Well, more than that, she had a wonderful personality. Anyway, I was saved by her, and she took very good care of me. I used to climb into her lap. Eventually, the villagers began to treat me well. It was the first time I felt like belonged.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Then I went into the forest for about half a day to pick flowers for the woman. When I returned, I found that the village had been attacked by demons and wiped out. I hated the fiends, but I was too weak to do anything about it. I couldn’t anything about it, so I ran away… I managed to survive, and I trained and trained, and a few decades laters, I eradicated those fiends from the world. But then…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar paused.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「After all that, it was just a waste of time. The villagers would not return, and life would return would not return to the way it had been. I had no purpose in life. I was alone, I had nothing to do, I wandered from place to place and helped a stranded man. He was very grateful to me. Why me, a demon? I thought. But when I took a closer at myself, i realized that before I knew it, I was just like a human. Maybe it’s because all I’ve been thinking about is avenging the villagers. I don’t remember the reason.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「At will?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Almost. As you can imagine, it takes a lot of strength to change a skeleton, so I can’t do that easily. The face seems to be on the woman who saved me. Anyway, i started to go around helping people after that. The man started to follow me. He was my first subordinate. After that, the number of people who worked with me increased one after another, and through twists and turns, we became the Arnelia religion we are today.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">After hearing the story so far, Lisa was convinced. She was surprised that the Arnelian religion had been established like a snowball, but she was sure that what they were doing was not wrong.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I understand.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「So for me, helping orphans is a regular occurrence. Don’t worry about it. Even an orphan can grow up to be a fine person if given the proper eduion and opportunities. Even if you don’t the Arnelian religion, there are opportunities for offices in the other countries. There have been people who became knights from orphans, people who founded towns, and even people who founded countries. The first generation of the Lazaar family was also an orphan.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa was speechless. Miliazar had been the protector of the humans for an uncanny number of years. And she would continue to be so. Perhaps she is someone that could be trusted. It was ironic that the first powerful person she trusted was a fiend. But, she already trust Alfiris, she thought.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Now that I’ve told you about myself, what about you? You’ve never told anyone about yourself. I think now would be a good time to tell yours.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Do you want to hear it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, actually, it doesn’t matter. But if you don’t, I feel that your mind will lose its equilibrium. It seems that your past has become a burden that you are not able to handle it. You’re not aware of it, or perhaps you don’t want to be aware of it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Are you a sensor?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m just old enough! Kakaka~」</p>

<p class="calibre6">A fiend who laughs vivaciously. But she may be more trustworthy than anyone else. And she was sure that she was just like her. Lisa thought of this and remembered her past. It was rare in the middle of the field, and she was all alone in the falling snow. She understood. Perhaps she should just let her mind go from that place, Lisa thought.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「If you’d like to hear about Lisa’s boring past, then please do.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Very well. Let’s hear it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar, who was smaller than her, patted her on the head.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then she remembered her earliest memories…</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 10 New Ally (3)</strong></p>

<p class="calibre6">「Where do I start…?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa couldn’t hide her confusion. After all, she had never told anyone about her situation. Her pride wouldn’t allow her to do so, and she knew that showing her weaknesses was something she would never do in the world. On the other hand, if she wanted to make fun of Alfiris, she was confident that she could say it like it was water off a ditch.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When she saw that Lisa was stammering, Miliazar offered her a helping hand.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Were you always an orphan?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, I was born in a very ordinary family, living with my parents. We were neither wealthy nor poor, and I think our family was quite normal.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Then perhaps you should start there.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar urged her. She was right, her family was indeed ordinary.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lisa’s father, according to her vague memory, was a young man who had come to Mysia from the countryside to work. His father was also good-looking young man, but her mother was a beautiful woman, and the tavern was thriving with customers who came for her. By the time he got married and Lisa was born, his father was hired as a full-time employee instead of a migrant because of his good performance. It must have been the peak of his life.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Her mother had also changed her job to a florist because of the late nights at the bar, but she would brag to Lisa every night that her sales had more than doubled since she started working there. It was a daily routine for her to teach Lisa the names and types of flowers she handled, and Lisa looked forward to learning the names of new flowers every day. The colorful flowers she brought home one by one, their fragrant smells, their names, and their meanings. Every time she learned the name of a flower, her world seemed to expand.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「We were a very happy family. They always took a day off once a week, and the three of us would go to various places together. My hair color was a little strange, but… my parents said, 『You have such a beautiful color. When I look at you, we feel so gentle.』They were always praising me. Yes, it was supposed to be going very well. Until Lisa said that one word.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">A happy family. It’s hard for people to realize that they are happy, but Lisa felt it. However, there was one thing that she couldn’t help but wonder. Certainly, for some reason… she wondered why there’s a woman always clinging to her father’s neck.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「A woman around his neck?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar asks.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Yes, she was beautiful. She didn’t seem to have any harmful intentions, and she looked at my mother and father with lonely, envious eyes. She couldn’t speak and didn’t seem to be able to see me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Didn’t you think there was something wrong?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I think so now, but at the time I could see things in other people’s eyes, so I didn’ question that humans were like that.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see. Your eyes are a kind of an magic eye.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The magic eye is an with special abilities that one is born with, or acquires through acquired training. Most of them are born with it. The most famous eyes are the Clairvoyant Eye, the Petrifying Eye, and the Igniting Eye. In Lisa’s case, it may have been the Evil Eye of Psychic Vision.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「As I said. Lisa wasn’t born blind was she?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I could see when I was born… but I destroyed it myself.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What a painful thing to do. I can only imagine why.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…I’ll keep talking.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It didn’t seem to make any difference whether she said it or not, so she didn’t mention it, but Lisa’s questions grew more and more every day. At this age, people want to ask adults 「why」and「how」even if they don’t have to. Lisa’s worries were understandable. The reason why she didn’t express her doubts was because she had a bad feeling about it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">But when Lisa’s doubts finally their limit, she was forced to say the forbidden words. And on her sixth birthday, she finally asked her parents.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Dad. Why are you always carrying a woman on your back?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">With that one question, Lisa remembers her parents freezing. Normally, they would have laughed and said,「What are you talking about?」 but her parents had an idea.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It was that night. For the first time in my life, I heard my parents cursing at each other. I remember peeking through the doorway at the scene in the living room. And then&mdash;」</p>


<p class="calibre6">The next morning, her father left the house. Lisa asked her mother why, but her mother wouldn’t answer.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「From that day on, my mother slowly began to go crazy. She started to miss a lot of work and sometimes slept all day. Lisa couldn’t eat anything all day, and she remember chewing on a loaf of bread she had left at home.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">After a few months of living like that. Her mother came out to the living room for the first time in a long time. Lisa talked to her mother innocently, expecting her to cook a meal for her. But,</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Mom was completely out of her mind. She had depressed, dark circles in her eyes. Her skinny cheeks and dry, lustrous lips. I remember that she looked like a dead person, not like the one of the most beautiful women in Mysia.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…And so?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「And when she saw me, she said, 『It’s your fault you were born! If you only hadn’t said those things! If only that woman hadn’t been there… he would have been mine all along!』That’s what she said, and then she choked Lisa.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s a little late for that, but it’s not what real parents do.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lisa agrees. That’s why I did everything I could do to resist.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">For a moment, Lisa didn’t know what had happened, but her survival instincts kicked in faster than she could think. She stabbed her mother in the hand with a fork on the table and bit her mother as hard as she could, which was not much damage for a six-year old to fight back, but it was more of a psychological shock for her.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「『Lisa, are you going to betray me too?』I remember her saying that. Lisa felt very bad and just stood there, but then Mom wandered off and started humming and spewing oil all over the place.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…And?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I guess she couldn’t see Lisa anymore. She set the house on fire without even checking Lisa’s position. I tried to put out the fire somehow, but even though I was very young, I knew that the fire was too strong amd there was nothing I could do.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As it was, it would have been nothing more than a survival instinct for Lisa to run out of the house without shrinking back in fright. When she turned around, all she could hear was her mother’s voice laughing like a mad woman. There was a great commotion around her, but Lisa could no longer hear anything.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then Lisa left as if to run away, and found herself in front of the flower shop where her mother.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I used to go to my mother’s flower shop often, so I knew all the people there. But the way they looked at Lisa was cold, I later found out that my mother, had been telling people everywhere,『That child is a monster.』 My hair was always this color, and people around me really didn’t want anything to do with Lisa. 」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa remembered the scene. She felt alone, as if she was the only one in the world. It was then that she saw the weed killer chemicals that her mother used to use in the flower shop. She remembered that her mother used to get very angry with her if she tried to play with it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Lisa didn’t want to see anything in this world anymore. What I had believed in had fallen apart, and happiness would never come back… So, not knowing for sure, I put the potion in my eyes. There were screams all around, but Lisa was satisfied. In fact, I couldn’t see anything anymore.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s funny, though. It didn’t occur to me to take the pills, or that I wanted to die. Lisa’s despair deepened as I realized this. I didn’t think I had the guts to take my own life. With my eyes, I could not die, and I wondered what I could do… How long did it take for the snow to fall on Mysia in the middle of nowhere?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She couldn’t see, but she could easily imagine that there was a lot of snow. Lisa had seen it snow once before when her mother was back home, and she remembered it was very magical sight, as if the sky was blessing her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Before she lost consciousness, she became aware of a crying voice coming from nowhere.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I heard a small child crying. That was Jake. When Lisa went to Jake, the child clung to me, crying and screaming. Lisa was already ready to die, but I thought that I would be just like Dad and Mom if I involved the child as collateral damage. And, I didn’t want to do anything irresponsible to someone who was in a weaker position than me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Whe did you awaken as a sensor?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s when. When the will to live came back to me, my ability as a sensor awakened. You know the rest from there.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa replied aloofly, but it was not a very easy life for her. Of course, Miliazar, who has livee for a long time, knows many lives that are more miserable than this. But, however.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But Miliazar said something that could be considered harsh. Although she took Lisa’s personality into consideration, Miliazar knew that consoling her was not the only way to be kind.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Before you go any further, I have no sympathy for you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I knew you’d say that. I don’t want your sympathy either.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But, if there’s anything I can do, I’ll help you. I have the courage and the compassion to do so.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I appreciate your concern. But I’ve already taken advantage of you earlier.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m a proud woman. Oh well. Whenever you feel like being pampered again, you can ask me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…I’ll take your offer.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa replied with a bit of embarrassment. Seeing this, Miliazar stroked Lisa’s head with her tail again.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 12 &#8211; Non-state Force</strong></p>

<p class="calibre6">In this case, the non-state forces, including the Church of Arnelia, which Miliazar belongs. There are a few other smaller ones, but I’ll just say the major ones this time.</p>

<p class="calibre6">〇 Church of Arnelia</p>
<p class="calibre6">A sect said to have been founded by Saint Arnelia. The headquarters is loed in the city of Arnelia, where the saint is said to be laid to rest. It is a religion with strict precepts, but rather a large, organized charitable organization. As the highest authority in the church, a saint (or Master Bishop) is recognized by one of the local churches every 15 years or so. The cycle is irregular, with some saints dying and others simply retiring. The organizational chart shows three archbishops, six assistant archbishops, and about 100 bishops under the Master Bishop. The canonization is elected by the archbishops and assistant archbishops. The area of influence extends over the Eastern two-thirds of the continent, and the total number of church-related personnel is said to exceed 500,000, making it the largest power on the continent.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It began as a group of people who sympathized with Saint Arnelia, who made pilgrimages to various places, and developed from there to assist in defeating the Archfiend and helping refugees during wars. In addition, monks and sisters without combat skills (especially sisters who are women) are often in danger not only from their enemies but also from their allies, and the organization now functions as a protection group for them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">If unjustified violence is perpetrated against Arnelian officials, the nations and organizations involved are obliged to pledge that they will not receive assistance from the Church of Arnelia under any circumstances. In return, the nations thay cooperate with Arnelian Church are given priority in receiving assistance in famine, pestilence, and the defeat from the fiends, and thus, more benefits than losses have been realized.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The main activities of the church during the insurgency period were the establishment of district churches to help the poor and the improvement of welfare and medical facilities. In addition, certain parishes were established and priests were dispatched to oversee each parish.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The Church of Arnelia has its own armed organization of about 30,000 Templar Knights, which is recognized as having the same power as the Knights of the Country within the faction of the Church of Arnelia. However, while the role of the priest is to supervise sisters, monks, and other facility workers, Templar Knights often take on the task of defeating fiends. In addition, they were established to protect the sisters and priests in bad area. Some of them, like the Saint, go on pilgrimages with the sisters.</p>


<p class="calibre6">〇 Magic Association</p>
<p class="calibre6">Although the organization is only slightly younger than the Church of Arnelia, its predecessor’s inception is said to be roughly equivalent to human history. One theory says that the study of magic was encouraged even before elves were taught it, but this is not certain, as there are many theories.</p>

<p class="calibre6">In the past, the Association actively cooperated with various countries to defeat the Archfiend, but after the dawn of the new age, the Association forbade intervention in wars. However, there were many mages who wanted to demonstrate their abilities to the fullest, so they left the Association and became personally involved in the war. The Association was so lenient to these people without punishment (or worse, many mages were researchers, and the political climate was weak and troublesome), which led to various offshoots and an increase in the number of people who studied magic in their own.</p>
<p class="calibre6">However, the forbidden war of the sorcerer Herhald led to a continent-wide condemnation of mages, including witch trials and the unjustified persecution of mages. Realizing the gravity of the situation, the Association declared throughout the continent that punishments would be severe and that mages would be strictly supervised. Using astrology and divination, the Association decided to take in those born with magical power and manage them all together.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Those who voluntarily offer to participate in the Magic Association are given a reward, and those who use magic without the Association’s permission and cause harm to civilians are subjected to conquest.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As a result, the activities of the mages have become much quieter than at one time, but there is an unspoken understanding that the Association does not supervise all of their activities. However, the actual force conducting the conquests are quite powerful, and it is said that once the decision is made to be conquer, it is impossible to escape. Therefore, on the surface, there are few mages who willingly harm ordinary people.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The selection of the head of the Magic Association is made once every 5 years by the Council of Magic Chancellors, and the person who has presented the most beneficial research to the Association in the four years since the previous selection is chosen. Therefore, depending on the results of the research, a person can become the head even if he/she is a 10 year old kid.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In addition, there are two systems of magic, one is vertical according to six attributes and other is horizontal according to the method of use. The types of usage include spirit magic, logical magic, summoning magic, dark magic, and others. Moreover, there is basically one attribute per person, and several ways of magic can be learned by studying it. When one attribute is strongly expressed, the hair color may change depending on the element, and for those who are strong enough, even the color of their eyes is said to change.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Therefore, many of them dye their hair, as the change of hair color is both an honor for mages and a great disadvantage in magic battles when the enemy finds out about it. Some of them control more than one system of magic, but the highest in history is said to be six.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Incidentally, 「magic」and「sorcery」are considered two different things, and the use of magic that is certified as「magical」is considered contraindied and sealed in the Association. Magic is considered to be an art that has an irreversible and permanent effect on history, land, and people, and is forbidden because of the arbitrary influence of the user to the world. Examples of magic that have been recognized as magic include「permanent changes in the attributes of the land,」and there have been confirmed cases in which the use of such magic has changed the people who live in the land and the form of the food that grows there.</p>


<p class="calibre6">〇 Church of Olympius</p>
<p class="calibre6">A church that has emerged in the last 200 or 300 years that dominates the western one-third of the continent. Unlike the Church of Arnelia, the doctrine of this church is based on the word of God known as the Ten Olympus, and it practices idolatry. The Church of Church also has a statue of Saint Arnelia as an object of prayer and penance, but it differs from the Church of Olympus in that the Saint is not equal to their God.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In the Olympus Church, at the age of ten, they are free to choose the god they believe in, but the doctrine and precepts are quite strict in each case. Atheism is not permitted in the Olympus doctrinal space, and is treated as heresy, the same crime as breaking a commandment. The treatment of heresy is extremely severe, and once a decision of heresy is made, it is rarely overturned, and the punishment for heretics is usually execution. Most heretics who are judged heretics flee the country, but they are subjected to extremely harsh pursuers called「inquisitors,」amd it is said that they would rather be burned at the stake than to be inquisitioned by them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The management of the Church is decided by meetings of the highest authorities in each of the Ten Faiths, a method that can be described as「Separation of Ten Powers.」The Church’s operations are similar to those of the Arnelia Church, but because of its short history, it is not as thorough as them, and there is some infighting in the lower levels due to differences in religious beliefs.</p>



<p class="calibre6">〇 Touma Kyoukai</p>
<p class="calibre6">An association that exists on the eastern continent. Unlike the churches in the west, however, the purpose of the association is a purely combat group that aims to exterminate fiends.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The number and strength of fiends on the eastern continent are far greater than those on the western continent, and the human sphere of influence has not yet reached half of the continent.</p>
<p class="calibre6">On the eastern continent, there was a time when humans were treated like tle by fiends, and the feud between fiends and humans is much stronger than in the west. For this reason, Touma Kyoukai does not want harmony with fiends in mind and its creed is「immediate destruction.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">Touma Kyoukai is made up of a number of powerful bloodlines that have made great achievements in destroying fiends, and its balance of power is maintained by democratically selecting a representative (a head) from among them and switching them every few years.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The current head is quite strong and is said to have increased the human power structure by 30% in the five years of its term, For this reason, this person holds the position of minister 11 years after becoming the first minister.</p>
<p class="calibre6">However, the actual situation is shrouded in mystery. It is believed that there are some negotiations with the western continent, but few people only know the details.</p>

<p><strong>Chapter 13 &#8211; New Ally (4)</strong></p>

<p class="calibre6">「So, back to my original question. Will you accept my request?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「… It’s fine. You’re right, there is some truth to what you’re saying. I’m going to trust you. But if you fail Lisa…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What will you do? Are you going to kill me?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s difficult for me to do that, so I’d rather die! I’ll spread such embarrassing rumors that I’ll kill you socially.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s much scarier! That’s not an idea coming from a 14-year old usually, is it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Fufufu, I’ve been through a lot of rough patches.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa lets out a gruff laugh, her face expressionless. If Miliazar misinterpreted her promise, she would seriously do it. Miliazar felt a slight chill run down her back, out of character.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Now, Lisa has one more for you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Sure. Okay, but no three sizes or anything.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Who cares about a little girl’s flat three-size? Why do you care so much about those two?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s a big thing to say! I think it’s no different than you caring about those two.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar thought she had said it in a mischievous way, but Lisa seemed to be annoyed.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Don’t make fun of me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmph, what a boring brat… You did hear that Miranda is immortal, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s good when『you don’t die.』It’s hard when 『you can’t die.』It was really painful for me when I saw her lose her beloved once. It’s worse than you think to be hopeless in life and not be able to die.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar narrowed her eyes and remembered the time when she had picked up Miranda before.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The guild had a reputation for having a woman whose whole body was dyed red with the returning blood of demons and went on a rampage, and it had become a problem. Anybody who tried to get close to her, regardless of whether they liked or disliked her, would be incapacitated without exception, but Miliazar had no intention of making a business trip if that was the extent of it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">However, Miriazar made her move when the magical beasts and fiends that she had made her promise not to attack humans, and even the beastmen that had been relatively friendly to humans, were touched. At first, she sent in her own dark side, the mouthless one, but even after reports of her capture, her survival was confirmed again after a while. After receiving reports that the woman she had captured would not die no matter what she did, Miriazar finally went out herself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At that time, Miranda saw her eyes. They were already shining with a strange light that did not seem to belong to a person. The woman who was supposed to be a mere human being was equipped with a pressure that even the experienced Miliazar felt frightened of.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But at the same time, Miliazar remembered feeling a sense of sadness. She wondered what had happened in the woman’s life to make her look that way. It made Miliazar’s heart ache just by thinking about it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I have a long life, but I still have people who will serve me for a long time. I’ve also been loved by many people and friends. I’ve seen many people die unhappily, but I’ve also seen many people live happily ever after. But Miranda had lost almost everyone who had ever been good to her in some unfortunate way. With all those memories, the human heart will die.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…That’s true.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Immortality is a problem, as is aging. Even if you are torn apart, you will never die. But it can be made to stop working. Try being crucified or something while being torn apart. You can’t die, you can’t regenerate, and you stay that way forever. Do you have any idea how horrible that sounds?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lisa is pretty sure to not approve that.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa shuddered involuntarily. Imagining such a scene and wondering what Miranda would look like at that moment. She wondered if that happened to her. It was horrible to even think about it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「They are also beautiful to look at. And unfortunately, some humans and fiends are cruelty we can’t even imagine.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That is, something I can understand.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Even though, Lisa has always avoided conflict, she has heard of the horrors of war in the guild. In addition, there are several cases that she deal with on a daily basis that make her want to turn a blind eye to them.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m also worried about Alfiris. It would be best for her to live in seclusion deep in the mountains, but that would be a pity. I wish I could travel with her, but unfortunately that’s not possible.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「So you want Lisa, Lisa is strong enough, is she?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「There aren’t many people who are better than me anyway. And I’m not all-powerful, either. Traveling is usually good for those who are comfortable with each other. I can see them as children… well, that may have bothered you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, I don’t mind them as much as I thought I would. In fact, if it weren’t for the little ones, I might have offered to do it myself.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Lisa answered immediately. This reaction was little a surprising even to Miliazar.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hmm… Why?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What can I say… I care about those two. And they were the most pleasant people I’ve ever been with. I guess you could call it a sensor-like rambling. It’s ridiculous for me to say this as a younger person, but I feel like I have to protect those two, especially Alfiris.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa didn’t know why she felt that way. She knows that sensors are basically weak beings and that she is of little use to them in battle unless she is taken by surprise. Ir was odd to think that she would want to protect Alfiris when she was in a position to be protected by her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hmm. Well, it could be the same reason why Miranda is by your side. It’s true that Miranda is a strangely protective person, and the fact that you’re a sensor lends credibility to her claims.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, I’m sure there are lot of weirdos that come around.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Really… weird huh?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar couldn’t help but gush. For some reason, she could easily imagine the scene, which was terrifying.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But don’t worry, Lisa will take care of the weird bugs from behind.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hmm, fine, in moderation… Kukuku」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa mimicked doing the giggling from behind, and the gesture was so cute that Miliazar laughed out loud.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Another person too good to let die. I should secretly have my dark side asa guard.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She thought to herself.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">Then Miliazar and Lisa successfully negotiated and met up with Alfiris and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Apparently, Millie wanted to have a victory celebration with them. And Lisa wanted to accompany them on their journey. At first, Alfiris and the others were surprised, but they gladly agreed, as they welcomed more traveling companions.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At the suggestion of Alfiris, the victory party was to be held at the restaurant of the beastman who had first approached her in the city of Mysia. When she arrived at the restaurant, he answered with two words and secured her a seat. He was still the same affable man she had met when she first met him. He was half dog-beast and half human, and his name was Urd.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Iyaa, I’m thrilled that the Onee-san remembered me!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, how can I forget people who owed me?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’ve got a nice thing to say. What do you day, Onee-san? Do you want to go out with me sometime?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What are you doing hitting my Alfie? You charlatan!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see you’ve gotten the bug.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Miranda and Lisa held their prey in their hands.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Quickly, this is ridiculous! And I didn’t know that Onee-san was into that kind of stuff.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, I’m not! I’m a real man pleaser…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What kind of lewd comments are you making here? Isn’t there a right and wrong thing to say even at night? It’s not good for your eduion.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Alfie… I’m not proposing to you, okay?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t want your proposal!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「So… Alfie-dono likes men.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Albert, that’s not a joke, is it?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">There wasn’t much alcohol in them yet, but they were a lively bunch. The owner of the store, a wolf beastman, was watching them with a smile on his face.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Urd, you’ve got a cheerful costumer.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Right? And they’re all beautiful. It’s a feast for the eyes.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, they are quite beautiful, even for a beastman like me. But they are even more capable than that.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Is that so? I don’t know much about that stuff.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Huh, you’re just being loud.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The one who swore was a feline beast of a woman. She was sipping alone in front of the store owner.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Something good happened to you, didn’t it? Don’t say that, Nia?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「They’re not even close to being calm. A warrior has to be calm.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Your warrior chief doesn’t need to be calm, does he?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Tha’ts why I don’t like him. And he’s got a first-class track record… A reason I can’t understand.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, he was special. But maybe those guys are as strong as your warrior chief.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmph, they’re no big deal.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Doesn’t it bother you to say that?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t care about them!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The feline beastwoman, named Nia made a slam! And placed the cup on the table with great vigor. But, her ears and tails were moving rapidly, and it was obvious to anyone who looked at her that she was very interested in them.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「She’s so easy to understand…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「She really is easy to understand…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Urd and the owner looked at each other and laughed, but the stubborn Nia would never admit it, so they decided to leave it alone.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So, why are you drinking milk at the bar counter?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Liquor is bad for me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Nu-uh, a little bit is good for you, okay? You’re an adult now, aren’t you, Nia?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You want to grow taller this time?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Leave me alone!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It was true that Nia was a bit small, even for the feline beastmen who are mostly small, but for a warrior, she was quite small. It is forbidden for her to say that she is too old to grow taller. At that time, Alfiris and the others’ table became even more lively.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Albert~, you haven’t been drinking at all!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I refrain. I’m not a drinker.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, then what are you drinking?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Cucus juice.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What are you, a child?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…I was wondering why I couldn’t get any Cucus juice here, you’re the one drinking it, Albert.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m not giving you any juice. Urd, add two more bottles of Cucus juice here.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Tsk… Urd! Bring three here!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Bring four.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Five!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It seems that a strange fight has started. Lisa against Albert is an unexpected combination.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What’s with the fruit juice chugging match?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">But the sparks were flying even if they tried to stop them… They decided to leave them alone.</p>

<p class="calibre6">And as for Millie and Miranda, it was…</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Onee-sama! (Looks like you finally told the truth. You’ve finally got your diaper off, chick.)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Millie~ (You’re getting too old for diapers as well, aren’t you?)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Onee-sama! (You idiot, I can live for another 1000 years!)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Millie~ (Take it easy, you’re almost ready to go to the bathroom.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The two girls have been calling each other only by name since a while ago, but somehow the atmosphere is getting more and more sour. No one but the girls knew the true meaning behind the words they were exchanging. Naturally, there was no one to answer Alfiris’ question as to why.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I feel like Sister Millie has been guzzing alcohol for a while now… is this alright?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Drinking alcohol is generally forbidden until one reaches the age of 16, but it is allowed for celebratory purpose. However, it is natural that such a custom is not observed. In addition, the age limit differs slightly depending on the region.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But what Miliie is drinking now was a strong drink liquor, even in a tavern. In the past, Alfiris would have lost her footing after just one glass of the same drink. The two sisters have already started to drink from bottles.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m not moldy&mdash;! (Onee-sama!)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Then let’s see it! (Millie~)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hey, don’t you think you’ve got the real intentions and the pretense backwards?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">For some reason, the two of them start trying to undress. Two sisters stripping off their clothes in a place like this is indeed unfashionable. She ask Albert for help, but before she knew it, he’s got about 15 bottles of Cucus juice open. Lisa’s and Alberto’s eyes were now completely fixed, and they were beginning to glow with a suspicious light.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(How could the fruit juice do this to me? S&ndash;Someone, please help me!)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris tried to hold off both Millie and Miranda, but they easily flung her in the opposite direction. It might not be the right thing to do, she thought.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At that moment, there was commotion at the entrance of the tavern. Alfiris thought that her heart’s cry had been heard, but it seemed that the situation was not in such an easy-going mood. Her friends, who had been acting strangely earlier, had already come to their senses.</p>


<p><strong>Chapter 14 &#8211; New Ally (5)</strong></p>


<p class="calibre6">「C&ndash;Can someone help me…?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris couldn’t believe her eyes when she saw the person who came in. Brown skin, pointed ears, blue eyes reminiscent of the sea, and long, flowing silver hair.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Dark Elf?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Elves are another name for the people of the forest, and are considered to be a race closer to spirits than to humans. Many of them live longer than humans, and they are said to be a very gentle race (some say they lack emotions). They also excel in magic, and some say that the elves taught the humans about magic.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It is said that they live in places where there is an abundance of nature, mostly in the northern forest areas. The white skinned elves are more cooperative with humans, but the brown skinned dark elves have been known to cooperate with the D and are hostile to humans and elves alike. It’s not uncommon to see even elves cooperating with humans in urban areas, and if dark elves were to come to the city, they might be the first to be killed.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The dark elf is front of her, but she don’t feel the evil that she have heard about. She looks like a pretty little girl herself, and even looks graceful. But, she thought she’s covered in blood and dying. She noticed that the elf was about to fall over. Before she could think about it, Alfiris had already run to the girl and was holding her in her arms.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Someone, help me!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Alfie, move aside!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Miranda immediately rushed to the scene. The girl’s injuries are quite deep and blood is pouring incessantly from her stomach. She can see that the hand holding her belly is already too weak, and despite her brown skin, her whole body is turning blue.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「This is… I don’t have time, there’s something I can do…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Are you sure?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">There were damages at the large blood vessels and some internal organs. Miranda thought that she was rather lucky to be alive. She must have some reason to be obsessed with life. But no matter how she tried, rhe dark elf girl was on the verge of dying.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miranda glanced at Miliazar. She is said to be the best on the continent at restorative magic. But Miranda’s plea for help is met with reluctant look from Miliazar.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I personally wouldn’t recommend it, she would normally dead. If you help her, you’ll get into trouble.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Isn’t it your destiny to be here to help her?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miranda looked at Miliazar with a sullen look in her eyes. Alfiris didn’t know what she was talking about and was only confused and flustered by Millie’s change of tone.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Miranda, don’t look at me like that… I can help you, but you know the consequences?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t mind, please proceed.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris wondered if Miranda had also changed her tone, but that was not the point right now. Miliazar walked leisurely over, examining the dark elf’s wounds.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hmph, let me have a look… Hmm, I think I can handle this. I’m going to use magic, so stay back, especially Miranda. If your affected by magic, you’ll be purified so much that you’ll lose your evil spirit and won’t be fun.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Are you kidding me in this situation?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Not so fast… Hey, Dark Elf. I’m going to help you and you’re going to explain later.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The girl seemed to have a hard time answering, but she managed to nod her head.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Let’s do this, you’ll feel better soon.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Miliazar made a mark with her hands, and for a moment, the air around her remained still. After that, a mysterious, yet warm feeling enveloped the surroundings. It was as if light was flowing in around her. The scene could be seen even outside the restaurant.</p>
<p class="calibre6">People other than Miranda and Albert have no way of knowing, but this is the Miliazar’s recovery magic that rang throughout the continent as the 「Miracle of Saints.」For ordinary sisters and priests, gathering light in their hands is the limit of their magical convergence, but in her case, she uses a wide range of restorative magic, she gathers enough light to cover a hemispherical radius of about 10 meters. In fact, Miliazar is better at sacred offensive magic, but due to her position, she can’t go on a rampage, and it’s been decades since she used it. Considerably, it is better to say her bare hands are sufficient for most enemies.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then Miliazar began to chant.</p>

<p class="calibre6">【O Benevolent Spirit of Healing, who lurks in the Earth and dances in the wind. Lend me your bounty and help us poor souls. I will take back your flesh and blood now in the name of the spirits.】</p>

<p class="calibre6">《Healing Circle》</p>

<p class="calibre6">Then the whole area was enveloped in light, and the glare was so bright that everyone involuntarily covered their eyes. After a while, everyone slowly opened their eyes again and saw that a circle with a radius of about five meters had been drawn on the ground with lines of light, and the air around them was clear as if all evil had left. The dark elf woman blinked her eyes and stood there with a look on her face, unsure of what had happened to her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You don’t need to worry about your life now. But it’s not going to be full recovery at once, so stay out of that magic circle for a while, okay? The effect of the magic circle will last for a moment. After a night’s sleep, you’ll be all right.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Amused, Miliazar showed a smile at her. The elven woman was surprised, but she gave a cute bow.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m going to ask you to tell me what was going on, or should I pay you a visit?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Yes, I think that would be the best thing to do so.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m sorry, owner, but can you close the store?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The manager, who had been watching the situation, nodded and made a show of it. Urd, who is in a daze, but the manager, who is accustomed to such situations, doesn’t seem to be upset at all.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I guess so, this is not good for business. There was a crowd of people outside the store. All of you, get moving, get moving, I’ll let this go for today!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「This is appreciated, owner.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s fine. But I’m gonna need to know what’s going on, as well.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t mind if you do.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The customers who were in the middle of eating and drinking complained, but the owner of the restaurant was confident in his skills, so he grabbed a couple of them, threw them out, and they all decided to leave.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Is this enough?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Very well. Now let’s hear what you have to say.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes. I’m sorry, but my name is Fenna Schmidt Rosenworks.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Rosenworks?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The color of Miliazar’s face changed.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Isn’t that the royal bloodline of Dark Elves?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Yes, may be the youngest of the branch families, but I am certainly of royal blood. Also, just so there is no misunderstanding,『Dark Elves』is a name given by you because of our skin color. We call ourselves the Seekers, and the races that have aided the fiends are similar to us in appearance, but they are called the Scorners, and they are the ones who parted company with us. I hope you understand.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Mu… I beg your apologies.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar apologized in an embarrassed tone. Fenna bowed lightly and continued.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Our village is very small, with a population of about a hundred. We used to live quietly deep in the forest of Dalcus. But the other day, we were attacked by humans, and our village was destroyed…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「By humans?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miranda was the one who raised her voice in an absurd manner.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「The closest to Dalcus Forest is the Principality of Krumus, but isn’t that a pacifist country? There hasn’t been a war there in decades, has there?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I am relatively young, so I apologise if I don’t know much about human civilization. I don’t even know if it was that Krumus who swooped in.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But you know, Dark… no, Seekers has many times more magic power than us, right? How many people did it take to attack you guys?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t think there were more than a hundred.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">This surprised not only Miranda, but also Miliazar. However, the other members of the party were as clueless as to why.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hey, is it really that impossible? I mean, we’re about the same in terms of numbers, but…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t know, Alfie. The average elven magic power is said to be ten times that of humans. If you are a member of the royal family, the amount of power would exceed to 100 times. That’s why it is said if a hundred elves get together, it could tip the scales of war between nations.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s how great they were?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s right. That’s why the elves are so few in number, but they have survived without being eliminated from the earth. They are a benign race that does not wage war on their own. Attacking and destroying the elves would be too risky and without merit.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What happened to them that only a hundred of them …managed to wiped you out?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar added her words. Fenna continued.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/wQZZykH/0348.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="calibre6">「Magic are… Our soldiers whose magic was almost ineffective to them. Even so, some of us were able to take up arms and fight, but more than thirty of us were cut down in an instant by just four people at the front. Father and Mother told me to run away from the situation, and I tried to escape with Mother’s transfer magic, but a soldier interrupted me… Mother was cut down right in front of me. I was also wounded, and I barely I had time to activate my magic, so the coordinates of the transfer point were messed up, and I was supposed to ask for help from my kin, but… I was sent to this town.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Tears well up in Fenna’s eyes. She had just lost her mother in front of her eyes. Perhaps even her clan.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I beg you… can you take me back to the Forest of Dalcus? Just as far as the nearest town. You don’t need to accompany me to my village.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Alfie, what do we do?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Fenna looked pleadingly around at Alfiris and the others. Even for her, she had nothing else to rely on. Basically, elves never leave the forest. She must not know where Mysia is now, or how to get back to the forest, if she is young. Also, it is extremely dangerous for a being who is commonly known as a Dark Elf to wander around the human world alone.</p>
<p class="calibre6">All of them instantly understood the situation, but to be honest, taking on Fenna was risky no matter what they think. Knowing this, Miranda ask Alfiris.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Do you want me to decide?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, you’re the leader. I’m just a companion and there’s nothing I have to do right now. But if I may give you my personal opinion, I don’t recommend it. But I’m going to follow you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lisa agrees with her. I don’t have a good feeling about this, but I think following Alfie’s heart is the best way to go.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She looked at Fenna. Her blue eyes stare at Alfiris with a mixture of anticipation and anxiety, as if she is asking for help, but also as if she is not sorry.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(…Abandoning this child to continue my own journey at ease? That’s unthinkable.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris’ decision was quick.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「I’ll help her. Let’s get her back to her village properly!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「! Ah, Thank you very much…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But your clan…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I understand. I’m not going to confirm the survival of my family. I’m just going to check the seal of our family’s secret art. 」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Secret art?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris thought she was supposed to be checking on the safety of her family.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m sorry, but I can’t tell you what it is. However, depending on the status of the seal, my future actions may change.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I understand, I’ll stop asking about the details. I’m Alfiris. Then, Miranda is the older one here with a foul mouth, and Lisa is the younger one with a foul mouth.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ahhn?! Whose mouth is that dirty?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Good grief, you’re such a huge woman, you know that?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">But, she seem to have a point.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「But how are we going to get there? It’s a long way, and the terrain is quite complied in that area. By the way, I’ve never been to that part of the world.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I think we should ask someone to show us the way.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t you know much about it, Fenna?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ve never been out of the woods before, so… if I can get into some of the forest, I can tell you」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ll show you the way.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">All of them turned around at the sudden offer, and before they knew it, the feline beastwoman was standing there. She was smaller than Lisa. But she had a strong-looking face and a toned body. She seemed to be a seasoned traveler and had some experience in battle.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「My name is Nia. I’m a soldier from Gruzald, but I’m currently traveling alone to train as a warrior. I’m familiar with that area, how about I become a guide for you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I appreciate the offer, but… why did you decide to do it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Because it would be a shame for a Gruzald soldier to abandon those in need.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">While showing arrogance. Nia turns her head away, but the owner is laughing behind her.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Don’t get cocky, Nia. Just tell them that you’re curious about them and you’d like to accompany them.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I&mdash;I’m not curious about them!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She crossed her arms and turned her head to the side, but her ears and tails began to move impatiently. This was…</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s easy to understand.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yeah, it’s easy to understand」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I understand that.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see, huh, this is what I call a tsundere.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Everyone in the room nodded their heads like saying「yes.」Fenna doesn’t seem to know what they’re talking, and she tilts her head adorably.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Tsundere? What is a tsundere?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Tsundere is a compliment. In the human world, it is said to be the highest honor to be called this. For your information, you can use it when introducing yourself, for example, 『Hello, I’m Nia, a tsundere,』aside from other examples.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Lisa quickly explained, but she was lying too much. But, somehow, some people was happy to hear that. The other members of the group are trying their best to hold back their gushing with a look of amusement. Alfiris softly whispered to Lisa.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Lisa, I don’t think that’s a good idea…)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「(There’s no way I’m letting such an interesting material go. If you reveal the truth, I will broadcast the information that you are a whore all over Mysia. I don’t mind, though, because I’m sure it will still be quite interesting.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It was an absurd threat, but Alfiris couldn’t object strongly because Lisa might actually do it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I&ndash;I’m sorry, Nia. I’m sure you’ll find out that she’s lying, maybe?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so, Alfiris tried make excuses in her mind. But then, she saw Nia mumbling, 「Oh, I see… That’s the politeness of the human world.」Incidentally, it would take Nia quite some time to clear up this misunderstanding.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Anyway, it seems that their next destination has been decided. While worrying about Fenna, Alfiris couldn’t hide the fact that she was somewhat excited about the new adventure.</p>


<p><strong>Chapter 15 &#8211; New Ally (6)</strong></p>


<p class="calibre6">「I wonder what should I say to the little ones…?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">After the decision was made to take Fenna back to her village, Lisa was alone in her thoughts. If it were true, she would have liked to spend a day with the children and then say farewell, but considering Fenna’s situation, it was obvious that they should leave as soon as possible. If Fenna wasn’t feeling well, she thought they could stay another night, but Miliazar’s recovery was amazing, and indeed, her near-death wound was almost completely healed. She’s sure that Miliazar was right and that Fenna’s strength would be back by tomorrow morning.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I can never be too good.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Did you say something?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The two of them are on their way back to Lisa’s house to hand over the children to Miliazar, in anticipation of their early departure.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I was wondering what I should say to the little ones. Lisa had been careful not to lie ot them but…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It couldn’t be helped, sooner or later the farewells will come. It’s the same when theh grow up. It may have been too sudden, though.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lisa may be okay with it, but the little ones are not old enough to understand it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s true…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">In the end, the two of them arrived at the house without coming to any conclusion. Even though the house was rented and shabby, it always made her feel at home when she opened the door, but now Lisa’s mind was in a dark depression.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m back… Well, everyone’s asleep. It’s late at night.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Nnhn… Lisa-nee, welcome back…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">But when Lisa entered the house, Jake came out of the kitchen, rubbing his eyes sleepily. He was probably waiting alone for Lisa to come home.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Jake, you’re a bad boy for still being up.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ehh, you see. There’s something i wanted to tell you while the others were sleeping…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Jake rummaged through a cupboard for something. Something in a pouch was making a jangling sound.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Lisa-nee, do you know what this is?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「This… this is money. And if it weighs this much, isn’t that a lot of money? Jake, how in the world did you get all this money? No way?!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">The thought of what Miliazar had told her came to Lisa’s mind. What did the child do to save so much money? A bad feeling comes to Lisa’s mind.</p>

<p class="calibre6">However, Jake, perhaps sensing Lisa’s intentions, was quick to shake his head and deny it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I didn’t do anything to worry you, Lisa-nee. I worked. I delivered mail and light packages. I also did some shoeshining. It was hard to ask for help at my age, though.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why? Was Lisa’s income not enough?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa raises her voice unusually. For her part, sbe has been working herself to the bone to earn the money. She has decided how to make ends meet, so there is no way she can afford to be short. She was desperate to make ends meet, at least until her children grew up, but where did she go wrong in her calculations?</p>
<p class="calibre6">Jake remained calm in the face of Lisa’s anger at her inadequacy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Nn&ndash;Nhn. That was good enough, you know?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Then why? Jake isn’t old enough to work yet!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But, Lisa-nee, you’ve been working since you were six. I’m ten-years old, you know? That’s why I can work too!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">If someone asked him, he’s probably right. It was the day after she had picked up Jake that Lisa had visited the guild in order to somehow turn the power she had awakened into gold. To be honest for Lisa, the idea of using the sensor’s ability to do evil had never crossed her mind. But for the sake of those younger than her, she didn’t want to do anything bad. She was also afraid of what her upbringing would think if they found out that she had been raised with the money she had raised from ber evil deeds.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But there was no denying that’s six year-old Lisa had to play a few tricks to be allowed to work at the guild.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Whether he knew Lisa’s thoughts or not, Jake began to rattle off words that he must have thought over and over again.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「We know, we can live off the money Lisa-nee makes, you know? We can live in a house with a roof over our heads. Sure, we don’t have a mom or dad, we don’t go to school, and we rarely get toys to play with, but I’m sure we’re very lucky. But what about you, Lisa-nee?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What do you mean?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa didn’t understand the question and asked back.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You work all the time, Lisa-nee. Do you remember the last time you had a day off? I’ve been counting the days you’ve been working, and I don’t know if it’s bigger than 99, but you’ve already exceeded that number a long time ago.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Yes, I see.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s right, so this is my way pf thanking you. You should take some time off. It took half a year to make this much money, but I’m going to make a lot more someday and make it easier for you, Lisa-nee! After all, I’m a man!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Jake…」</p>


<p class="calibre6">How can a boy who is merely an orphan with no particular eduion or skills earn more money than Lisa, who is ranked high in the guild? It may be just a childish fantasy. But Lisa couldn’t remember the last time she had such a fantasy. She was now aware of the fact that she had been busy with her daily life that she had stopped thinking about her future.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Lisa thought back when was the last time she had a dream. Wasn’t it those days that she spent with her parents without worries? Didn’t she ever think that she would like to build a happy family?</p>
<p class="calibre6">If Jake can have a dream, does that mean that he is now a source of comfort to them? Lisa’s heart was filled with warmth as she felt that everything she had done had been rewarded, including Jake’s thoughtfulness.</p>
<p class="calibre6">And Lisa cried without even knowing it, She hadn’t cried when her father left her or when her mother had committed suicide. She thought that she was incapable of crying. At least, she was not in a position to cry. But now, there was someone who was willing to do something for her for free. She had never been so happy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I see, so these are tears of joy, huh? All that hard work was not in vain…)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Jake, who was oblivious to Lisa’s excitement, was too busy talking about herself to notice him.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So, you know… if… if, you know? If I can make enough money to protect Lisa-nee… will you marry me?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「……..Eh?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The sudden words stopped Lisa’s tears of joy, and she turned her unguarded, surprised face to Jake. It’s not an unpleasant look, but it’s not something that she want to make in front of Alfiris and the others.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(…Just now, just what did he say to Lisa? This kid, did he just ask to marry me??)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As a sign of denial, Lisa shook her head and checked again. Lisa thought it was just another one of Jake’s jokes.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Jake, what did you say just now? Don’t make too much fun of Lisa.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「D&ndash;Don’t make me say it twice! I really want to marry you!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…..Haa.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Wha&mdash;What the hell? That’s your answer!!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Jake started to get flustered, probably because he didn’t expect the answer. But, on the surface, Lisa was trying to act as if she didn’t feel anything, but inside she was panicking. Apparently, Jake was serious. Lisa never thought that he would just skip the whole「I like you」and「We’re going out」thing and suddenly propose to her. And it was from a boy who had been wetting his bed a while ago. Lisa’s mind went completely blank as she couldn’t realize what was going on.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Behind her, Miliazar was trying her best to hold back a laugh that was so threatening she twist her abdominal muscles. Lisa could sense that he was sweating and shaking a little, as if he was holding back too much.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Jake. You, did you what’s the meaning of marriage? 」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s alright, only Lisa-nee will be in my eyes!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lisa, is called a monster by her own parents.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That doesn’t matter! Lisa-nee is Lisa-nee!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lisa may be good for you now, but by the time you’re older, you may have found a better woman than Lisa.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That may be so, but… I’ve already decided that I’m going to protect Lisa-nee for tbe rest of my life!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Apparently, Jake was not going to back down, but it sounded like a child’s indulgence. So, Lisa thought, to give him a challenge too. She thought that Jake would give up.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「…Listen, Jake. If you want to marry Lisa, there’s something you have to promise me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What is it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lisa only wants to marry a good man. If you want to make money, you have to amke enough to buy the most expensive house in town. Can you do that?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I will!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s not enough to have money. Lisa likes a strong man. Even if the Archfiend attacks, she doesn’t want a man who can’t protect her by himself. But of course, dying is out of tbe question. Can you promise me that even if the Archfiend’s army attacks and all the people flee, you will fight to protect Lisa and win?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Of course!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Appearance is also important. I don’t like someone to be taller than 5’9″. I also don’t like muscular men. You need to be supple, yet smart. What do you think?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If that’s what you want, Lisa-nee, I’ll become like that.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Not yet. Power is also important. We are orphans, and no one will accept us without status. You shall become a knight and a general in some kingdoms.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t want to be so petty by being just a general! I’ll even build a kingdom for my Lisa-nee!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa was troubled by these words. She couldn’t think of any more excuses. He seemed to be in a straight line so far, and yet he answered all the impossible questions immediately. The last one seemed to hit home especially hard for Lisa. He was just a kid, so he probably didn’t have any idea of the practicalities of the situation, but she was very moved to see the boy who had said that he would even prepare a country for her alone.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Lisa is blind, but I’m sure Jake is looking at me with a serious gaze. Even though ge was ten years old, he had look in his eyes that was so straightforward and sincere that a woman couldn’t help but be attracted to him… For the first time, I might have regretted my own blindness.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Lisa closed her eyes and looked down, but then she raised her head as if she had made up her mind.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So, Jake, do you see me?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m looking at you! I have been, I am, and I will be!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see… Then here is Lisa’s reply. Close your eyes. Don’t open them until I say so.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She made sure Jake closes his eyes, put her hands on his face and gently kissed him on the lips. She could see that Jake stiffened instantly, as if he was petrified. Lisa could easily imagine that her own face was probably bright red as well. After all, her cheeks were so hot. She didn’t want Jake to see her like this.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Their lips were pressed together for about ten seconds. It felt as if they had been doing it all night, but it was probably just her heart’s desire, and in reality, it had only been for a moment. Apparently, a part of Lisa’s head had gone numb as well. Stunned, she let go of his lips and gave Jake a gentle hug.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Listen, Jake… Lisa is going on a trip. You will be taken care of by the sister behind me. She may be a little flabby, uneven, and lacking in sex appeal, but she is a trustworthy human being… Learn under her. Then you’ll become a great man and come for me. When you do, do the same thing you’re doing now. But when that times comes, don’t just kiss me, kiss me along with your vows…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes…… I will!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Jake replied empathically.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「(Children are so simple… And Lisa is a child as well, huh? But maybe it’s okay to be so simple when it comes to feelings of love for someone.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa naturally had a smile on her face. But at tbte same time, she felt sorry. She have to leave her children at a time like this.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Please forgive Lisa for leaving you on this trip… I really should have told you this much earlier.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s fine, it’s my turn now. I will take good care of them. So don’t worry about anything.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">People grow up so fast. Jake, who Lisa had thought was just a child, was about to become an adult before she knew it. He and Lisa were still children, but Lisa was thrilled that she had even taught Jake to use the toilet.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(This looks promising… in 10 years, he might become a really great person and come for Lisa. Regardless, she will accept his proposal. But until then, Lisa will have to work hard to become a great woman as well.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa was rather unsure if she would be more suitable for Jake, but she convinced herse by deciding to improve herself. After all, there was still time.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Jake… Thank you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s fine, don’t mind it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Are you sure you don’t want to hear anything more? You’re not worried?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Just write to me from time to time, that’s all. Just don’t cheat on me with anyone else, okay?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…You’re getting carried away, Jake.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She put his head between her two fist and grinded it. Apparently, Jake was quite elated with the success of his proposal. But Lisa had the same feeling inside.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ouch, ouch! Lisa-nee, stop it!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, let’s leave it at that, shall we? But how should we explain this to the othee children?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t worry, I’ve explained to everyone what to do in case if emergency. 『If Lisa-nee finds something she wants to do, I won’t stop her.』 Well, Milche might be reluctant, though. By the way, if I’m gone, Nelly is next. When Nelly is gone, Ruth will be in charge next.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You thought that far ahead…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It seemed that the children were much stronger than Lisa had thought they would be. She was sure that they would be able to support each other even if she was no longer there. Except, of course, for their real life means.</p>

<p class="calibre6">At that moment, Milche walked over to her, rubbing her sleepy eyes.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Nnhnn? Lisa-nee, Jake… What are you doing…?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Milche, you’re awake. Come on, it’s okay. Let’s go sleep over there, okay?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I want Lisa-nee to hold meeee~」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ll be right there later… Jaje, please take Milche first.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Un. Make sure she gets a good hug later, okay.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, I will.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Jake took Milche and went to the bedroom. And when they were alone, Miliazar started laughing loudly as if she had finally lost her patience.</p>



<div class="calibre" id="calibre_link-37"><h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 16 &#8211; New Ally (7)</h1>



<p class="calibre6">「Fukuku……Hahahaha! Y-you, good for you, you have a lovely boyfriend!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Shut up, you flabby pie!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar, who had finally reached the end of her patience, started laughing hysterically. Next to her, Lisa swears while her face turns bright red. Miliazar pats on the shoulder while holding her stomach.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well, you actually want to make him a great guy, do you? I’ll take good care of him.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If I leave him to you, he’s going to grow up to be a terrible man.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, I’ll take care of that. Even so, I may not be able to satisfy all of your needs.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That was just a pretext. I didn’t think he would be able to answer all of them immediately and even get an extra one. I feel like I’ve won a very big bet.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You bet your life… didn’t you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, you’re right about that, but the results were better than I expected.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Lisa looked very happy when she said that. Miliazar was also satisfied with Lisa’s expression.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(… It’s always good to see people’s faces like this. I want to see a lot like this. Apparently, my heart is not yet rusty.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Miliazar also smiled. But Lisa left Miliazar alone and soaked in the happiness. It was also the first time in eight years that Lisa felt truly happy since her parents had disappeared.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">The next morning, when Milche heard that Lisa was going to be gone, she was still a little upset, but the children all comforted her. The children all looked sad, but no one complained. It seems that Jake was right, it was one of the possibilities they were considering. Then Lisa said goodbye to each of them.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Then, Sister, I’m counting on you to take care of everyone.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Leave it to me. I’ve got it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Will you all greet the sister properly?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">At Lisa’s urging, the children lined up in a row and bowed in unison.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「「「「「Nice to meet you, Sister Pettanko!」」」」」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa and the children grinned at each other.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Y&ndash;You’ve… really done it, Lisa!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Fufufu, it’s hard to take care of those kids. They’re just too much.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Fuu」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Where’s the other, Albert!?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">That’s how Lisa departed. It was better than being damp, Miliazar decided. The children kept waving until Lisa turned down the street and was no longer in sight.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">Meanwhile, at Alfiris and the company. In the end, they decided to use the dragon to get to the forest that Fenna indied. Miranda suggested that it would be much better than exposing Fenna to the public with a horse. Fortunately, Miliazar had been able to secure a dragon large for the five of them to ride, and tbe dragon shop was preparing it for them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Alfiris is quickly communicating with the dragon. Rather, it might be better to say that they have been licked around a lot and Fenna rolled their eyes as they watched the scene, though they were no longer impressed by what they were used to seeing it for the second time.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「By the way, Nia, you hardly have any luggage. What do you do when you fight?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t use weapons, I use my bare hands. Well, although I do wear armor and shin guards on the battlefield.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Bare hands… isn’t that dangerous?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Weapons are more dangerous to me. Blades are usually chipped or broken if you cut an enemy. And if you cut two or three people in armor, an ordinary sword will be useless. It is said that if you cut with overwhelming speed, you won’t get grease and blodd stains, but there are very few who can do that.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmm&mdash;, that may be true.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert might fit the description, but Miranda agreed that there certainly weren’t many people who could use it like that.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But isn’t it difficult to finish off an opponent with your fist?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, I’m a soldier. In war, if you can kill your opponent with a single blow, that’s good, but it’s more important to make them seriously injured, to put them out of combat. Those who are obviously dead will be abandoned, but those who are dying, those around will try to help them. That way, it takes five hands to save one person. To put it in another way, it would have the same effect as retreating six people with one blow.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「More to the point, on the battlefield, ordinary soldiers sometimes use swords that are deliberately dull. Soaking the tip of the blade in a manure puddle for a day and you have an instant poison sword. Wounding an enemy with this will almost certainly produce fever. If you do that, you’ll be in a lot pf trouble after you return to the enemy lines.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If you put it that way…」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Miranda thought she had a lot of experience, but when she thought about it, she had never participated in a war between humans, even though she did against the demons. Listening to Nia’s story, she began to think that wars between humans might be more cruel than those against fiends.「Hmm, I see.」As Miranda groans, Fenna pulls Miranda’s hem.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Um, are you sure you want to leave Alfiris-san alone?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Eh? What happened to Alfie… you mean, Alfie is half inside the dragon’s mouth?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The upper half of Alfiris’ body was completely inside the dragon’s mouth, and she was repeatedly twitching. Miranda and the others rushed to help her out. It was an unexpected crisis.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I can’t believe it! How can you be responsible for my wounds?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Guh, guwah!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Do you think that you can get away from this, as if I can let that happen!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Guguh…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">And they were already in the air on their way to Dalcus. After that, they were all busy pulling Alfiris out. Alfiris seemed to be dying a little bit, and she said she saw a beautiful castle or a flower garden.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The dragon seemed to be like Alfiris, and it was probably just a sweet bite to show its affection for her, but its sweet bite was coming from a 15-meter dragon that could carry a large number of people. It’s not like a dog or cat. So for about two hours after getting on the dragon, Alfiris was complaining about the dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It’s not often that a domestied dragon shows its own affection for a human, but Alfiris seems to be a good match for the dragon. They’re not sure if Alfiris is strange or not, but Fenna calls out to Alfiris from the seat on the dragon’s back.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Alfiris-san, you can talk to the dragons?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Eh? Yeah, I can almost understand what they’re saying. Do Seekers don’t understand them? But I think you guys are more compatible to dragons rather than humans.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「If it’s a tree dragon with forest attributes or something, it might be okay, but do you understand the language of wyverns, Alfiris-san?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Fenna looked at her as if she was wondering more than she should. Alfiris continued to talk as if it was obvious.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’ve only been able to understand the language of wyverns for about two days now. There was a dragon near the mountain where I used to live that could speak human language, so I asked him to teach me his language. He told me that dragons also have a common language. I was told that once you understand that, the rest is just dialects of different races, so you won’t have any trouble communicating.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s new to me. I’ve been told that once you understand that, it’s like a dialect of your race, so you won’t have any trouble communicating for now.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Uh… Can I tell you something? I believe she said her name was Gwendalf.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">When Fenna heard the name, zhe was puzzled. She wondered if it’s such a big deal. Miranda, who could not swallow the wing situation, pulled on Fenna’s sleeve.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hey, is that a great dragon?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, it’s a dragon that is legendary even among the elves. I thought it was just a fairy tale, but I never knew it really existed…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Was he that great?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, he said to be the dragon that taught the elves how to use magic. Originally, magic was something that was unique to dragons.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Alfiris reacted to those words. She didn’t think she had been in contact with such an amazing dragon herself.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hmmm. I used to him『Gwen-ojichan』all the time… I used to play with him on his head. Was that bad?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Fuu… I’m afraid that I can’t do the same.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Perhaps it was her imagination, but Alfiris felt as if Fenna was looking at her with respect.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m sure you’re not going to tell me that the dragon gave you Alfie a little hand, which hasn’t changed a scratch since I first saw it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, I got it, you know? He said it was a good luck charm. He said it was given to him as a talisman, though he had his master work on it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">This time, everyone’s mouth were agape. Then they all started talking in secret.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Lisa, how much do you think those things cost?)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「(It costs about 15,000 pents to process a normal wyvern claw or scale. If you want to make a weapon, it will cost you at least 50,000 for the materials of a tamed dragon. If you have a dragon, you can buy a whole small town if you can get it appraised. Lisa would not even think about selling it.)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「(It’s a piece of armor that’s supposed to last a hundred years without chipping or rusting. It’s also said to be magic resistant.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I think it’s quite a blessing to have it.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris is still complaining about the dragon, while everyone else is whispering in the shadows.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I wonder if I’m friends with the right girl?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It was no wonder Miranda folded her arms and pondered.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">This time, as expected, it was not a distance that could be covered up in a day, so the group camped out along the way. The reason why they didn’t stay in the town was because there were not many facilities in the town to rest such a big dragon, and also because they were concerned about Fenna. Fenna looked apologetic, but they were not the kind of people who would complain about a one-day camping trip. Lisa had never stayed in the wild before, and she was unusually talkative with such excitement. Alfiris and Miranda tried to get Nia to practice with their bare hands before going to sleep, but as soon as they tried to step forward, their bodies flew into the air. According to Nia, the first move is the easiest to set off.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s not because of that, but we humans call them felines, and they’re a genus that excels in initial movement and instantaneous power. They can move as fast as any other species, especially up to 20 meters. So, if you hold a sword or any weapon, you will be wasting a lot of time, and you will be able take advantage of our strength. Do you understand?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s true… If you move that fast in front of us, we might not be able to respond.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, on the other hand, I’m not very good at endurance fighting, and my arm strength is not much different from that of a human. I try to make up for it with techniques.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So, Nia, are you a captain or something in Gruzald?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Nope, I’m just an ordinary soldier.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">If she was a common soldier at this level, how could humans be at war with beastmen? Alfiris and the others were grateful that they were not born in a time when they would have to go to war with beastmen.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Can Fenna do martial arts?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m mainly an earth magician, but… my magic is a bit unique. I can use a bow as a weapon. I don’t know if I can call it martial arts, though.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Then try shooting this.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Suddenly, Miranda threw a Cucus nut into the air. At the same moment, Fenna picked up the bow and arrow that she had placed on the ground and shot it. She shot the fruit in the air.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s amazing enough…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, even though I’m not a warrior… the bow is made by humans, and it’s not very accurate yet, with a margin of error of 5 cm within 20 meters.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It was enough considered to be expert level, in the eyes of public.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「With an elf bow, I think I can get a margin of error of two centimeters within 40 meters, but that’s it for me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, no, no. Normally, a bow can only kill at about 20 meters.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「An elf bow can kill up to 60 meters if shot by a man. If you just aim it, it can kill at least 100 meters. When we used it to compare who was the best archer in the village, we had a rule that you had to keep hitting the target 100 meters and if you missed even once, you are disqualified, but after one hour five people kept hitting the target and everyone got bored and quit.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「How big is the target, by the way?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「We started with cucumbers, but they were so hard to miss that we ended up with nuts the size of the tips of your thumbs.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…I can’t even pick a fight an elf, now can I?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris’ impressions were also correct.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The night went on with endless chatter. Lisa was teasing Nia with the nip, but Alfiris decided to leave her alone. She never imagined that both of them would be so absorbed in the game that they would have trouble sleeping next day.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">The next day, they arrived at the entrance to Dalcus Forest in the early afternoon. The pace was more than twice as fast as that of a normal human driving a dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The town of Darv. It’s a small town compared to Mysia, with a population of less than 30,000, but it’s quite lively. Although Dalcus itself is loed in the middle of nowhere, it has an abundance of forest resources (timber, nuts, medicinal herbs, etc.), so its population is rather large for such a remote area.</p>

<p class="calibre6">In addition, fiends from the forest are frequent, and because the area is bordered by four countries across the forest, Kramus’ border guards and mercenaries can be seen here and there. Despite the large number of such armed men, the town has a relaxing atmosphere, perhaps due to its remote loion and natural surroundings. The soldiers are not dressed in formal attire and are sitting around chatting with the owners of vegetable stalls. Perhaps it is the disposition of the people of Kramus. They did not look like the kind people who would invade an elven village.</p>
<p class="calibre6">At any rate, Alfiris and the others came to the town to gather information. Fenna is also accompanying them with a hood over her head, but the town does not seem to have a strong atmosphere. In particular, there is no sign that Kramus has moved its soldiers.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「This serene vibe… wasn’t it from Kramus?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But I think it’s the most likely. It is quite difficult to enter the Seeker’s Village from the other three countries because of the terrain. I have heard that Kramus is the only one who uses Dulcass as a resource in the first place.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Let’s explore some more.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Nia, Fenna, and Miranda are discussing things. Alfiris and Lisa, who are not familiar with the military situation in the area, are not quite able to follow the conversation.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I need to gather more information about different countries and places right…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lisa agrees. From now on, we must be more sensitive to information about other countries.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As Alfiris and Lisa were lost in these thoughts, they saw a crowd of people on the street beside them.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hey, what’s that?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Who knows. Let’s go to find out.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Is Lisa the only one who can sense the trouble?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">At any rate, when they all approached, it appeared that a person was lying on the ground. It appears to be a man, but they cannot see its face. For some reason, Miranda’s face was strangely glowing.</p>


<p><strong>Chapter 17 &#8211; New Ally (8)</strong></p>


<p class="calibre6">Wondering how Miranda’s face lit up, Alfiris poked Miranda with her elbow.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hey, why do you look so happy?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Because I smell some handsome man here.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Sister is really a pervert. Well, I won’t stop you from helping people, but I’m sure the real disaster will begin when he is saved.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’re bad at listening to me!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so on, but Alfiris and Miranda were serious about helping. Lisa said,「God, help the poor passerby… Heaven, help that Sister and an appetizing event for the huge woman…」Muttering something like that.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hello, mister. How can I help you? Is there something wrong?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">There’s no response. Apparently, it was just a mere shibboleth. And then,</p>


<p class="calibre6">「…Ooh…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ooh?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ohh… Oppai……」</p>

<p class="calibre6">They were wrong, it was just a pervert. At that moment, the man’s head hit the ground with a crunching sound. Of course, it was Miranda who did it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ahh&mdash;… This guy’s beyond saving. He’s just so, so, so… human.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, Miranda just put the finishing touches on it, didn’t she?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「He’s beyond saving for you as a person, Onee-sama.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hey, Lisa, don’t you think you’ve been acting to kind of awful to Alfie and me lately?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">While Nia and Fenna, who were not accustomed to the usual development, were stunned, the man who was thought to be dead came back to life. Suddenly…</p>

<p class="calibre6">「A&mdash;NE&mdash; SA&mdash;N&mdash;!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Kyaaa!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">The man jumped into Alfiris’ chest, uttering unintelligible words.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Wha&mdash; What are you doing&mdash;!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Miss, don’t be so cold! Do it like you always done!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What do you mean,『as usual?』」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Everyone, including passerbys, went completely blank. Miranda was the first to come to her senses.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…Ha! Hey, you little pervert, get away from Alfie!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Another strange bug. Alfie, aren’t you emitting some kind of pheromone that attracts strange insects?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I&mdash; don’t care, just rip this guy off!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">But even with the help of three people, the man showed no sign of leaving.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「He’s one of the biggest, weirdest bug I’ve ever seen… Can we kill him?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「We got no choice… Kill him!?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The moment Lisa and Miranda look at each other, saying something disturbing&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…Oi, Lexus, what are you doing?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Eh?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The man who never tried to leave Alfiris no matter what she had done before, suddenly turned around. Instantly,</p>

<p class="calibre6">Gon!</p>

<p class="calibre6">The man’s head was hit by a pickle stone with an impact sound. It must have been a blow to the man’s heart, and he fainted again. Alfiris and the others thought that he might never wake up again.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「My companion is disrespectful. Please let this slide.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「No&mdash;… It’s fine.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">In front of her was a man, perhaps a woman, of about the same stature as Alfiris. Her firm and ample breast give away her gender, but without them, it would be easy to her appearance for that of a man. She has sharp eyes and well-defined face. Lusa and Miranda are also well-rounded, but they are different. She looks as if all the softness has been removed, leaving only the features of a warrior. It is rough, yet seamless. But if she were properly dressed, she could pass as a pretty woman. Although she does not look like she would be at all suutable for such an outfit.</p>
<p class="calibre6">On that subject, her hair is dark and long. It is tied in one bundle a little above the neck, but if she untie it, would it be close to her waist? But it is rare to see black hair. It seems that people around her were the same way, and when Alfiris was admiring her, wondering uf she was a mage or not, the woman was already walking away.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’ll leave you guys to it. I am in a hurry and cannot offer much in the way of apology but I see you again, I will return the favor in some way.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ah, no, that’s… M-May I ask your name?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">For some reason, Alfiris reflexively asked the woman’s name. The woman looked a little perplexed, but answered without looking particularly uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s Rui. I’ve given up my last name for certain reasons. How about you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ah, my name is Alfiris. I, also, have given up my last name…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, we have each other’s like this, so we must be going through a lot. Then, I’ll see you again when we have a chance.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Leaving only those words, the woman went without hesitation. The pervert is properly taken… however, dragged away away with his legs. He’s on his back, so his face is going to look terrible, Alfiris worries, while Miranda holds her head in her hands.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What’s wrong, Miranda? Are you frustrated that you didn’t get the hot guy?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Nah, I don’t want that pervert… I mean his name is…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m certain that you said the name Lexus? Do you know him?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, I don’t think we know each other. I think I’ve heard that somewhere.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…wake up, Lexus. You’re awake already, aren’t you? Walk by yourself.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Did they know?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The man who was being dragged rises with a boost.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What would you have done if I had been a few seconds late?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmmm, I think I would have comatose those three beauties anyway, and taken the elf with me, was that enough?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「She was a pretty capable person, including the beastkin behind her.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But she’s still a little green. I can beat her no problem.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If only those guys would let their guard down. But that’s not our job this time.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, I’m not sure. I figured it couldn’t hurt to ingratiate myself with Zelver.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Lexus while laughing, replies with a light-hearted smile. But Rui’s expression remains the same.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Let it go. Zelver just screwed up. There’s no need to clean up his mess.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If Miss says so. So, what do we do now.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I know what I’m going to do. I left my coat at the inn.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, Valthus-san will get mad at us again right&mdash;?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I know that’s why you’re going to get it. You’re not even wearing it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The two then return to the inn and put on matching coats that are randomly left in their room. A black coat with gold buttons. On the left breast is embroidered the crest of a hawk, also in gold. On top of this, Rui wears a large sword on her back and Lexus wears sword on both side of his hips.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Miss, let’s make sure the front of your coat is properly lined up.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s hot. You’d better be right about Valthus, he’s wearing a cloak.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmmm, I wonder what old man Betts would say if he saw me…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s my job to nag him. If I were to get serious, Betts would lose his job and the bour would progress faster.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…That old man, doesn’t look like he’s going to be around for another 50 years or so, though.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’ll stop with the light talk. Let’s go.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ahh, wait a second! Ane-sannnn!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Rui leaves the inn in a dash, followed by Lexus in a hurry. In the direction they are traveling, they can see&mdash;&mdash; the forest of Dulcass.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">「AHHHHHH&mdash;!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Ugh! Come on, Miranda, speak louder.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Here was Alfiris and company. They are going to spend the night in this derve today in order to prepare to go into the forest. They had arranged a place to stay before going out for shopping, and just as they came to put their luggage in the room, they heard this loud voice. Nia and Fenna are also holding their ears.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You’re really restless, Sister… what’s wrong?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lexus… I just remembered!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’ve been worried about him all day?」</p>


<p class="calibre6">They all look doubtful, but Miranda’s face is serious.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I couldn’t tell because it was so different from what I imagined… maybe we were lucky.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Lexus… if I’m not mistaken, he was mercenary known in the West as the 『Lexus the Reaper』and『Lexus the Hundred Slayer,』that person.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Was he that famous?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Nia makes a face that says she still can’t believe it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I only heard rumors, too. But I’ve heard the same rumor many times, so it’s pretty plausible.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Like what?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I heard that when he participated in a war in a certain country… his unit was ordered to pursue an enemy force of over 2,000 men. But it was raining too hard to chase them. And the enemy soldiers were camped across the river on a snadbar or something like that. The river was flooding, and the enemy troops couldn’t move anyway, so his commander decided to wait and see what would happen. That’s reasonable.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Then the young swordsman said,『If I hit the enemy in the neck in this rain, how much do I get paid?』Everyone thought it was a joke. They thought he was bluffing, because it was insane to cross a river flooded by heavy rain and come back with a surprise attack. So they said,『How about 100,000 pence for 100 people?』And then he said,『That’s good』and walked out.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Miranda speaks plainly.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「And in the morning he appeared before the commander and said,『I’ve killed a hundred people. You can check on it when it stops raining.』The commander thought he was joking around and said,『Alright, this is fine.』Then he said,『I’m going back today. It’s the second day. Make it count.』and disappeared. Amd the days went by and the rain never stopped. On the eleventh day, when the rain stopped, his unit’s watchman was astonished by what he witnessed.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「The flooding of the river had not yet subsided, but a soldier who was observing the enemy position through his binoculars screamed. 『There’s that kid over there!』Amd what was even more astonishing was that Lexus, alone, was disrupting enemies’ position. And they were completely on the run, no they were so scared of Lexus thay they didn’t have the energy to resist. Well, for ten days they were left alome and helpless to escape, and half of them, 1,000 peolple, were killed. And yet, when he thought he had slayed every single person who begged for their lives, he suddenly stopped killing and came back. He sawm across the still-flooding river without a care in the world. Them, as soon as he returned to his camp, he said 『I’ve killed another 100 people. This time, you made sure of it, didn’t you?』」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Gradually, everyone’s complexion turns pale.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「The next morning, the enemy finally begam to flee across the river, which was still flooding. That’s how scared they were Lexus. I heard that most of them drowmed and sank during their escape. But the eneky commander survived and escaped to a large fort.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Seriously?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But no reward was paid. That’s because, aside from the commander’s head, the rest of the deal was all a joke. The moment the captain of the pursuit unit mentioned that, the captain’s head left his torso. The company commander, platoon commander, and kinsmen who were present were not concerned. And he became a hunted man amd got a nickname. He was monikered 『The Hundred Slayer』and『The Reaper.』If the rumors were true, and he was willing to do it right then and there, it would have taken all of us to find out.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That woman, treated that Lexus thing like a subordinate.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Nia mumbles softly.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「If so, how strong is that woman?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…I don’t want to bother thinking about it. I just hope that when we meet on the battlefield, they are the not the enemy.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">They all fell silent. Would they see them again? No, she bet they will meet soon. For some reason, Alfiris was sure of it. And that woman who called herself Rui was more interesting to Alfiris than Lexus.</p>
