<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Preparing for Subjugation</h3>

<p class="calibre6">「Alfiris, please wake up already.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, isn’t it a little early to be?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What are you going to do if it gets worse? You won’t be able to become a bride.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Nhn, geez. You really know how to get people listen to you.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris is woken up by Lisa at the inn. It had been long since the sun had risen, but Lisa was an early riser.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Lisa, have you had breakfast.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Done already. Unlike you, Lisa is a hard worker.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If you ask Lisa, she’s a luddite. Let’s just make sure I don’t grow up to be like you in the future.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Guh… You’re only cute when you shut up.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I can hear you.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Alfiris stares at Lisa with expressionless eyes. Although she must be five years younger than Alfiris, she’s a girl with a strange sense of oppression and intimidation. For some reason, Alfiris finds it hard to argue with her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You should have a little respect for those older than you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, I do respect them. As a role model.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「… She’s really a mouthful…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It seems that Alfiris has no chance in a quarrel. Alfiris had no choice but to get out of bed. But as she recalls, yesterday was a tough day.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris and company were pondering what to do, since they couldn’t leave the brawl in the tavern alone after making one of them.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Lisa recommends to leave them alone. They’re dorky, but they’re not stupid enough to kill each other. Besides, if they make too much noise, Mysia’s vigilantes will come.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Anorn, what are we going to do?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, let’s just leave it at that, shall we?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hey! Are you still a servant of God?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, I hate gods and fate. There’s nothing in Church of Arnelia says you have to believe in God.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No way, this sister…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">When she saw Alfiris wincing at Anorn’s unreasonableness, Anorn thought it was a bad idea.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’ll go stop them if you insist so much. Lisa come here for a minute.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn took Lisa and walked briskly to the center of the group. On the way, they almost got into a brawl, but all the men they almost hit were blown to pieces. Strangely enough, no one noticed that Anorn was blowing up the men. All of them were to a certain extent, so they probably thought it was just an optical illusion that the seemingly fragile sister in front of them was tearing and throwing large men.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then the Sister goes to the center and all the lights go out except the one that hits her again.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(So how is she doing that!?)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Everyone, please listen up!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The brawl quickly dies down and all eyes are on Anorn.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「This time, I’ve chosen this Lisa-chan as my member! So don’t fight for me anymore!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn sobbed and showed it. Sister looks like she’s going to say more.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「And so, thank you all for your hard work. Please stop fighting, you stupid bastards!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa’s terrible apology and the deep and polite bow was not at all sincere. Naturally, the men begin to protest vehemently.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「No, I’m not going to accept this, Sister!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, for whom do you think we are fighting?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「We’re not going to stop until you take one of us with you!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s right! That’s right!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The men were making a lot of noise and couldn’t get it under control. At first, Anorn was listening to everyone’s complaints with her annoyed eyes, but she must have gotten tired of it. She gradually returned to her normal face.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「This, This isn’t good…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Just as a bad feeling began to creep into Alfiris’ head, one of the men finally said,</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Sister, will you take me with you?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">He grabbed Anorn by the shoulders. At that moment, Anorn’s face took on a devilish expression.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Who said you could touch me, punk?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn twisted the man’s hand up and the man let out an inarticulate scream. She slammed the man down on the desk and everyone on the tavern froze. Anorn shouted in the silence.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Don’t make me say it twice. I told you we already have a member. Are you punks have a problem inside your heads to not understood that, ahh!? Go home, take a shit, and sleep, you ugly bastards. And after you wash your face, don’t ever show it in front of me again! Let’s go, Lisa!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ah, yes, Sister!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Before she knew it, Lisa was giving Anorn a glittering look of envy. When she said『sister』 She thought she may have found the wrong target somehow. But she’s using the name of the Arnelia Church, and Alfiris is not sure if it’s okay to do this.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The men, however, were speechless, frozen like statues with faces as if they were having a terrible nightmare, and seemed to be having none of it. It was if their faint dreams had been shattered in an instant. Anorn’s transformation would have surprised anyone who saw it for the first time, but for some reason Albert didn’t move an inch. It was questionable on how calm he was. It was clear that the mercenaries would not be able to move, at least not until they left.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Alfiris, Albert, what are you standing there for? Let’s go!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Alfiris suddenly came back to herself, but she didn’t want to be thought of as this Sister’s companion. She had a feeling that she would never come back to this guild again.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">As they left the guild, Lisa inquired about the contents of the request.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m going to go home. What about tomorrow’s meeting?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Can you come to the our inn in the morning? Well, how can I explain this to the blind Lisa?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, don’t worry. I’ve picked up on your presences, so I can use my sensor abilities to find you. If you could just tell me where the inn is.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You know that much? It’s two streets over from here, I believe, with a red sign and a shovel…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see, that’s Mr. Souza’s inn. I understand. I’ll tell you about the reward then.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「We can negotiate it then, but why not now?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t mind, you don’t seem like the kind of people who would be stingy with your rewards, and since it’s not a request made through a legitimate guild, I’ll expect the opposite. In fact, I’m in a need of money right now, so that would be more helpful to me. If it’s a long-term request, I’ll just take an advance payment.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Lisa seemed to be a seasoned negotiator. Anorn was inwardly impressed with the fact that she had earned the title of high rank at her age.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「No, let’s do these things first. The reward is divided into four equal parts. I’m not going to be stingy just because I’m a sensor. How’s that sound?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Good enough.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The sensor’s reward is usually a small share. This is because they are all in the rear guard and are not in direct danger. To receive an equal share of the reward is almost unparalleled treatment.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert raises his hand.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「No, I’m on a mission, so I don’t need my share. You can divide it into three equal parts, excluding my portion.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s it then. Anyone else have an opinion?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">No one seemed to object Anorn’s words.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s settled. If no one else has business in town, we should leave tomorrow at noon, including preparations. That’s the plan.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m sending my out to be sharpened, do you think it will be ready in time?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If you show her one of your tits, she’ll sharpen it as fast as light.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「So you’re the kind of person who does that.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, I’m not! Anorn, please don’t mislead me.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris began to visibly wince at Anorn and Lisa’s words, so Albert followed up seriously.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…Give him a little grip and he’ll be sharpened by noon. I’ll make sure we have transportation before then. I have an idea.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What are you going to hold?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, you’re talking about the chip there. What did you imagine, disgusting.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, Lisa, you should leave it at that, Alfie’s naive. And Alfie, you should call Lisa by her normal name. I’m sure you’ll be fine. Is that okay with you, Lisa?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If that’s what Sister ask, it’s fine.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Just when Alfiris thought she might be able get by with this,『…Tch!』she thought she heard Lisa click her tongue. Alfiris was very anxious about her companions.</p>


<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">When they returned to the inn, it was already fully booked and they could not secure a room for Albert. Alfiris and Anorn wondered what to do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’ll sleep outside the door. Wake me uo if anything happens.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That won’t help if you get tired. At least on the sofa…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I can’t do that in a woman’s room.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">He refused without hesitation. Alfiris was impressed that he was a knight after all, but Anorn didn’t seem to be amused.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I thought it would be fun to have a man and a woman under one roof~ I was looking forward to seeing the look on that simpleton’s face when she tore into Alfie in front of Albert~!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What do you think you’re doing with my body? I’ll never be able to get it over it if someone sees me and says, 『……Fuh!』」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m afraid to say it. I’m afraid of the Lazaar family.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m sure the sisters was a lot cooler than I thought. Normally, when she sees a handsome guys, she’d say, 『Oh, you’re so handsome!. Would you like to do it me?』」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s not very nice to hear. Am I a lascivious woman?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I thought we were the same.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Here and there, Alfiris fires back.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well, I’ll admit my face is good, but I’ll spare you the Lazaar family. Oh, I get the chills just thinking about it!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn has goosebumps. It seems that even a violent, unmannered sister has her weaknesses. Anorn is not sure what she remembered, but she’s sure that Alfiris will just ignore it if she tries to find out. She have always thought that this sister is sly in that way.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Alfiris and the others fell asleep while having such a rambling conversation. Alfiris felt that it was fun to talk with Anorn after all.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>


<p class="calibre6">That’s what happened yesterday. It seems that Alfiris is not a good sleeper, and while she was sleepwalking, Anorn was already getting ready.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ahh, ohh? What’s wrong, Sister?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmm? What do you, mean you’re preparing to take down an Archfiend?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Instead of the usual fluttery sister’s clothes, Anorn was dressed in a light, form-fitting outfit. Her hair was tied up in a bun at the back, she wore small hand and shoulder pads, and a leather pochette around her waist that held many small items. She is preparing to pack them one after another as she produces medicine that Alfiris have never seem before. She also has a huge hammer-like mace propped up on the wall.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Sister, that appearance is…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, I never told you, did I? I used to be a warrior, mostly in the vanguard. This is my equipment from that time. The church was kind enough to deliver it to the inn for me.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">While saying that, Anorn was preparing quickly and efficiently. Alfiris thought to herself that Anorn surely had such a strong arm.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「So. I’d like to ask you a question, Alfie. You can also use a bow, right?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「In a way. But I haven’t used it much in practice, have I?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You can use magic to increase the distance and accuracy, just like you did with the dagger before. How many shots can you do?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmm, I’d say about 40 or 50. I haven’t tried it lately, so I don’t know exactly what can I do.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Then I’ll take it as 40. This time, the vanguard will be me and Albert. Alfie will be Lisa’s escort and backup.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s alright, but… can’t I be in the vanguard too?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn explained to a disgruntled Alfiris.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「… I’ve defeated multiple Archfiends before. You’re still not strong enough to be the vanguard. And Lisa’s escort is always necessary. The archfiend is rarely alone, and usually has its army with it. It is dangerous to leave the rear guard behind.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t know if I agree with you, but I’ll defer to the experienced.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Good to see you being so honest.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn smirked and looked at Alfiris. It’s true that this warrior’s costume suits Anorn better, and she may have originally had such a simple atmosphere around her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But it’s great that you’ve done fiend subjugation before, isn’t? Did the sisters also register with the guild?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hmmm, yeah.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「By the way, what’s your rank?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…B+.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Wow, that’s amazing! Isn’t that the best in some towns and regions?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, it’s not. Okay, that’s enough boring talk. I have to buy some food, so I’ll leave first. Alberto said he would meet us at the west gate as soon as he was ready. By the way, since I’m not dressed as a sister anymore, you can call me 『Anorn』 instead of 『Sister.』 If you make a mistake, I’ll bare it in front of Albert!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">No sooner said than done. Anorn had left.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「W&mdash;What the hell?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris changed her clothes.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「……Norma」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa peeked through the crack in the door and called out to her.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Damn, this is hard…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She was supposed to be blind, so there was no need to worry about her seeing spell mark, but Alfiris felt strangely uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">After a quick meal at the inn, she went to pick up her sword, which was still unsharpened, and thought about giving it a tip, but being a naive girl, she didn’t know what the going rate was.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I knew I had to do what Sister said… No, no,no I haven’t even held hands with a man yet. No, not even if I’ve held hands with a men before but… Hmm? Then, where do I even start??)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As Alfiris agonized by herself, Lisa, who was frustrated, asked the shopkeeper something. The shopkeeper then rushed to take out Alfiris’ sword and sharpened it at the speed of light.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Well, I was saved, but what should I say?)」</p>


<p class="calibre6">In addition, she tried to procure a bow and arrow, and for some reason, the owner offered her a service.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Hey, did I do a good day’s work? The shopkeeper looked a little pale for a man of his age… Let’s pretend I didn’t see Lisa smirk…)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Then, as Alfiris left the store ahead of Lisa, she heard the shopkeeper’s scream from inside the store. What kind of exchange was going between the two of them was already beyond Alfiris’ imagination.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">Then at the west gate.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Oh, you’re early.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn has already bought food and other necessities, and loaded them into the flying dragon.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What’s that?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What’s that? A wyvern.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「From where?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「In larger cities, wyverns are used for urgent logistical transport. It’s worth remembering.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert explained and Anorn added.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「It can fly over low mountains. It can also carry large loads, so it’s convenient. It’s still early in the morning, so we can be near the forest we want in the evening and find an inn.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t worry about lodging, I’ve already made arrangements. We were supposed to have one wyvern this time, but the big ones, the one that can carry four people, are out of stock, so we’re down to two flying dragons and two riders, if you’ll forgive me.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert bowed his head to everyone. Many knights are quite pompous, but Albert keeps a low profile. It’s a shame that is the only thing that makes him likable.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You’ve never been to a wyvern before, have you, Alfie?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ahh, yes. That’s right.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’ll be fine. I’ve driven a wyvern before. Most of them are well-trained these days. so it’s easy.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’ve driven it before, Anorn… but I’ve never done it before.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Neither Lisa has.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Admiringly, Alfiris looked at the wyvern, and somehow Anorn was behind it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Anorn, what are you doing?」</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Tsk, you’re calling me by my name. If you hadn’t, I’d be stripping in this weather under the sun.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Such a pity. It’s a shame, because I could have made a lot of money out of nothing.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">They both made a「good grief」 gesture, but apparently they were serious. As expected, Alfiris turned to Anorn in disgust and annoyance, she was licked on the cheek by a wyvern from the side.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hyaah?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, I can’t believe the wyverns even like you. You’ve got a talent. You might be able to become not only a Beast Tamer, but also a Dragon Tamer.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I&mdash; I don’t mind that but please help me~!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris is being licked and rubbed against by two wyverns, making her squirm.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「No, please don’t… You can’t me lick me like that… Sto&mdash; Nnh~」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What are you doing in this morning, screaming like that, you disgrace.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I&mdash; I’m not doing this for the love of… No, don’t do that!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She may not be aware of it, but it was quite a sensational sight. It’s also nice that her voice is not so deliberate, Anorn thought.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Hmm, I was going to help you, but do you mind if I observe a bit more? No, but this is a bit…)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As Anorn was thinking about this, she noticed that everyone passing by had stopped to take a look at the scene. A small crowd had begun to gather. Anorn thought that she should leave it at that, but then…</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What’s all the noise? What’s going on?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, the guards at the west gate. This is a problem again?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">When a man who looked like a guard came out of the crowd, Anorn made an annoyed face. The guard strode forward towards her with a frown on his face.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Where the hell do you think you are? You’re a suspicious lot, come over here so we can check you out!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">The man who grumpily called out to Alfiris was a greasy-faced, very unattractive looking man. He looked like the type of man who would do something shady like a physical examination.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(It’s troublesome, I can’t just punch the guard here and cause a mess…)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As Anorn pondered what to do, Lisa approached the man with a look in her eyes that said, 「It’s alright.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Guard, we’re not suspicious. We are on our way to Kalam in the northwest on business. We will be on our way soo, so I hope we won’t bother you too much.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What! Your panic is getting more and more suspicious! I’ll have to look into this at all costs!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">With a disgusting smile on his face, the guard reached out to grab Lisa. But Lisa glared at the guard with a blank expression on her face.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Is this good?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Good for what?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The guard’s hand stopped reflexively. Lisa quickly approached the guard and asked.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「You’re Ron from 3rd Street, aren’t you? The one who lives on the second floor of a house with a red roof. You kissed your boss’s wife in a drunken stupor st a banquet among the guards the other day, didn’t you? If your wife and boss find out about this, it’s going to be a very entertaining scene.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa chuckled, but the blood instead drained from the man’s face.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Y&mdash;You, how did you know…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Who do you think Lisa is? It’s not just things and people I’m looking for, but also rumors of sorts, you know?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hiek&mdash;! Please don’t tell my wife or my boss!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Now then, what am I going to do… that’s what I am supposed to say but, I’m going to let you off the hook on the condition that you don’t tell anyone what Lisa and the others are doing at the West Gate. Is that okay?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I understand…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Even though he deserved it, the poor gatekeeper wobbled back. Alfiris knew that what kind of thing she had said to the arms dealer earlier, but she might not want to know the details.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ahh, I’m saved.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s the second time since this morning. You’re really a pain in the ass.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s why I’m saying thank you…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「A thank-you note will not add anything to your life. I would have asked you to get down on your knees, but that would only be fun for a moment, and there are more effective ways to get you naked. So let’s call it a bill, and let’s make sure you pay it sooner or later. If it can’t be turned into money, it’s not worth anything at all. Remember that.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">With that, Lisa walked off to the wyvern. Alfiris felt that as if had been told something very scary.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m going to go defeat the archfiend, but I wonder if I’ll be able to do it properly…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The lack of tension and coordination was beginning to worry Alfiris. But perhaps that was unavoidable. Except for Anorn, their knowledge of the Archfiends was limited only to books, they didn’t know that the Archfiend in Kalam was far from the fiends Alfiris had known until now, at this point, there was no way for anyone to imagine it.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">By the way, in this world, a year is about 8 months. A month consists of 45 days.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anyway, the group decided to ride the wyvern.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Lisa wants to ride with you, Sister. If you ride with that big lascivious woman over there, you’ll catch the pervert infection.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Who’s a pervert?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Can’t help it. Albert, can you take care of Alfie?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, ma’am.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris is reluctantly convinced by Anorn’s comforting pat on the shoulder. She really wanted to ride with Anorn, but she had no choice but to go with Albert’s wyvern.</p>

<p class="calibre6">She don’t mean to discriminate against Albert, but Alfiris is not very good with men. It’s fine when you’re fighting, but it’s probably because you’re not used to dealing with them in everyday life. The fact that Albert has a neat face makes her even more nervous.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ah, um… I know I’m not very good at this, but please take care of me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It would be perfect if you had three fingers.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn laughs. When Alfiris put her feet up on the saddle and jumped onto the wyvern, her eyesight became considerably higher. The wyvern itself, even a small one, is about 9 meters long, and its eye level is about 4 meters high even when sitting. Since riding on top of it, will be like being on the second floor of a house.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hold on tight. If you fall, we can’t help you, and if the rider is unstable, the wyvern can’t gain speed.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Y&ndash;Yes.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris grabs Albert’s back tightly.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s not good enough. The first time you fly, it’s especially bumpy, so keep your hands in front of my hips until you get used to it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I&ndash;I’m sorry.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Alfiris-dono, don’t bite your tongue. Miss Anorn, you’re ahead.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Aye.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">She never been so attached to a man in her life, Albert didn’t know that Alfiris was so upset inside that her heart jumping around thinking that it might be her first time, he quickly launched the wyvern.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As the wyvern stands up, the body of Alfiris shakes, and indeed, if the rider does not catch her, she will be shaken off.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(It shakes like crazy… No wonder it’s much bigger than a horse…)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It was the first time she had ever seen a wyvern. It is said that small wyverns can ascend without assistance by flapping their wings on the spot, but this does not seem to be the case for larger wyverns. The shaking became faster and smaller and finally with a thump! When it took a big step, she felt a floating sensation as if her stomach would lift.</p>
<p class="calibre6">And the sight that Alfiris saw below her when she closed her eyes was the sight of the buildings already getting smaller.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Whoa… A&ndash;Amazing!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s going to go up to about halfway between the clouds and the earth!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Isn’t that too high?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s why you’ll die if you fall!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I&mdash; I understand」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Alfiris clung tightly to Albert.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Such a large back… I can tell he’s been working out a lot. You’re not like my master… W&mdash;What am I thinking?!)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris remembered her mentor Aldorius a little. During the first six months or so of her life with him, she often had nightmares. Some of those were like sleepwalking and sge would even go into rage. At times like that, Master would hug her to sleep, she felt that he was strong and tough, but in reality, he was almost the same size as she was now. She remembered that he had been succumbed by illness and had become as thin as a stick at the time of his death.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She also remembered that he had treated her like a guardian and had never made feel like a man or a woman. Perhaps because of this, Alfiris also had an unreserved attitude in front of her master, and he often told her to have a little more modesty as a woman.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(But I’m really grateful to Master. In hindsight, I couldn’t complain about what he did to me… I hope Master is resting in peace. I’m going to do some hard work now, like defeating an archfiend, but don’t worry, I’ll be back safely!)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">With determination, Alfiris unconsciously squeezed her hands together.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You don’t need to exert yourself so much anymore, Miss Alfiris.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh… I’m sorry. More importantly… Whoa! What a view!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She can see people coming and going far below her. They were the size of a grain of rice. Beforr she knew it, they were already about to fly over the next town.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was impressed by how winding the road was down there, though she couldn’t tell from walking on the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre6">As she looked around, she could see far into the distance. She wondered if that was mountain where she used to live, and was deeply moved. Further north, the Pirebos Mountains, the highest mountains in the continent were faintly visible. To the southeast, the sea should be visible, but at this altitude it seemed impossible.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Isn’t it amazing, Alfie!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn, who had caught up with them, spoke up.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Yeah! That’s very nice!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Isn’t it? I like the sky, you know. It’s because this shows us that no matter how strong we are, we’re still tiny! In this way, the difference between a king and a slave is insignificant.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I feel the world more strongly than humans! It’s like… the world is talking to me!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Feeling the world… that’s definitely you」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I agree with you, Lisa.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa, who had been quiet until now, reacted. She lets her long hair, which had been tucked into her robe, falk out and let it flutter in the breeze.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s probably not the way Alfie feels. In this sky, Lisa is very quiet because we are the only human presence she can sense. Yes, in Lisa’s case, her body, or should I say her mind, feels lighter. This is the world, I think. It’s a feeling I can’t really describe.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She was talkative for Lisa, but she guess that’s how good she felt. She closed her eyes and leaned into the wind. Then she opened her eyes and smiled at her. It was the first she had ever seen her smile like that.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Anorn is also in a good mood, and is talking with Lisa.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「It’s hard to live in the city when you have such a strong sensor ability, isn’t it? It is said that if you are blind or hard of hearing, your sensor abilities become stronger. By the way, I’d like to ask you a question that will help me in combat: How far can you detect a presence?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「We have to be in the city, though, or we won’t get any requests for Lisa. I’m not a sensor that specializes in minerals and plants.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As for the range of the sensor, it’s a 200-meter radius under normal circumstances, and a 500-meter radius if she put her mind to it. After half a day of maintaining a detection of 500 meters, she would collapse from fatigue. And if she focus on one direction, the longest she can go is two kilometers.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Anorn was frankly impressed with her ability.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s more than. It’s not often that you see someone with such a large detection range. Is that all you can detect」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「All living things. It’s difficult to detect those that are too small, evil spirits, or mineral life forms, but I can make a rough judgment because I have a strong intuition for dangers that I feel uncomfortable going towards. I can also detect nonliving things with a radius of about 20 meters. Maybe it’s because I’ve in the city for so long, but I’m biased towards detecting living things.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see. If your abilities are that strong, you must be uncomfortable living in the city. Why don’t you set up a base somewhere in the country?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s true, but I can’t leave the city.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why not?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t think I’m obligated to tell you that much, am I?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa’s attitude hardened. It seems that both Alfiris and Anorn have something in common with this attitude, but Lisa will not open her mouth even if she has to. Even though they had only known each other yesterday, they both understood that much.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Albert was the only one who didn’t lose his usual aloof, blank expression, as if he hadn’t heard anything.</p>


<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">Once landed on the ground, after a lunch break, Alfiris was given a chance to try out the wyvern. At first, she was a bit hesitant to run on the ground, but within a few minutes, she was able to make the wyvern fly in no time.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You’re better than me.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert said to Alfiris, praising her honestly. She waved her hands in the air as she manipulated the wyvern.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I think I can fly anywhere in the world like this. The sky seems to be the right place for me, maybe I’ll be a dragon rider.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris is in a great mood, but Anorn is staring at her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I don’t know if I can tame a wyvern that fast.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It depends on how well the dragon is trained and its personality, but I don’t think the dragon is that easy to handle. By the way, I also trained a dragon to ride, and it took 7 days to make even a well-trained and gentle run, and a month to make it fly. I can’t ride like that.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s right… It took me three times as long. Even so, I was told it was too fast. I’m sure you’re not the only one.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…A full fledged dragon rider, perhaps even a dragon knight.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「With little training, she might even be able to become the highest ranking dragon knight, a dragon master.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">By the way, the great northern country of Romansland, located at the foot of the Pilebos Mountains, has a large army of dragon riders. It is said that the strength of the army exceeds 30,000, and the ordinary soldiers are called Dragon Riders, the guards and troop leaders are called Dragon Knights, and the division leaders are called Dragon Masters.</p>
<p class="calibre6">There are few women who have been able to reach the rank of Dragon Master. Anorn had heard that the second princess of Romansland had succeeded in becoming the first female Dragon Master since the founding of the country, but she was not sure. But as far as she knew, there was no dragon rider who could ride a dragon that well.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Without realizing it, the joyful laughter of Alfiris could be heard from the sky. The laughter didn’t stop until it was time to leave</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris took control of the wyvern, it was moving in a surprisingly fast pace, and it didn’t seem to be getting tired at all. Anorn couldn’t keep up with the pace, so Anorn’s wyvern took upon itself to get behind Alfiris’ wyvern and use it as a windbreaker. The wyvern of Alfiris noticed this and gave it a look that said, “Are you sure this is the right speed?”, Alfiris’ wyvern noticed this and loosened the reins.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I’ve heard that a dragon’s fatigue and speed depend on its rider, but I never thought it would be like this. And she’s communicating with the dragon. Even though, they are domesticated wyverns, their pride must be higher than that of humans, which is why they can sense the skill of their riders and make various adjustments on their own.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert was pondering behind Alfiris, but he looked like the same as usual because be bad always had a unmoving face. When it came to Alfiris,</p>


<p class="calibre6">「(It tickles me when you grab me around the waist.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">That’s all she could think about. As it was, they were able to reach the Karam region a little earlier than planned, before the sun went down. They would be heading further to the west-northwest from here, but it would be appropriate to spend the night before heading out, so they made arrangements through the Arnelia Church.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The village of Roth. It is a small village with a population of about 2,000 people, but there is a monastery related to the Arnelia Church, and a survey team was supposed to have come here. After receiving a report from them, they planned to stay at the monastery for the night and head out to defeat them.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">It was at the dinner table.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Shouldn’t we call the level checker from the guild, Sister? We don’t get paid or recognized by the guild.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「This time, I want to handle it secretly without going through the guild. It’s a small group of people for that purpose. I’m going to take the reward from the church for that. I’m sure has considered this possibility.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see. It is better not to ask why.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa replies as she carves the meat for dinner.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「It’s okay to tell Lisa, though. Because she didn’t seem to mind when I told her we were going to defeat an Archfiend, do you think the idea is great?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, if you look at Albert, you can guess. You can imagine how bad it is when a knight like that comes out. In the first place, it was strange that an Archfiend would appear so close to a human village, but since adventurers bring a lot of information when they are in the guild, I thought that something like this might happen sooner or later. Besides, it seems that kind of thing has already happened in many places.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「… Really?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa’s line was so unexpected that Anorn was taken aback. Lisa was also taken aback by Anorn’s language.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m serious. It seems that such things already happened in Lelei and Berens in the south. It seems that both of them were defeated by chance before it became a big deal.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Then I guess I should have asked Fulgund to send an army here too. But if we send the army here, the world will be in an uproar. I’m not sure if this is the right time to announce it to the world. But who did it, the subjugation of an Archfiend?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It didn’t seem to Anorn that there were that many people who were that skilled. Lisa answered obligingly, as she had asked.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「In Lelei, it seems that Zemus, a certified hero, and his party just happened to be nearby. In Berens, it was a passing mage whose name I don’t know. Rumors told that it was a woman.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Zemus… I don’t hear too many good things about him, even for a hero. Also, the mage is woman, and she’s hunting the Archfiends alone. I’m sure there are only a few mages of that level, but who are they? Is it a witch?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t know about that, but rumor has it that she was a very good looking woman. It’s just a rumor.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m famous for being beautiful sister, too.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…That’s true.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’re a stick figure!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I think you’ll be known as a violent sister in the end…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As Alfiris was thinking about this, Albert came out of the abbey.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「How did it go, Albert? What about the survey team?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「None, it seems that… no one has come back.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What the? How many people did they send?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn slumped in her seat.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It was a survey, so there were about ten of them, but they all returned safely five days ago. Then they said they were going to back to investigate because there seemed to be enough time, and they never came back.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Did we arrive too early?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That doesn’t look likely either. According to the sisters here, they were scheduled to return the before yesterday. It also seemed that they knew that we were scheduled to arrive as early as possible.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「So it’s possible…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I think there’s a high chance they were wiped out.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Silence enveloped the room. Considering the purpose of the survey team, even if they were about to be annihilated, if even one of them could return, the purpose would be achieved, so they would have taken action to leave at least one person behind. But anyone can guess they couldn’t do that either.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Actually, I’ve been searching that forest with my sensors for a while now, but…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa opened her mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「The detection doesn’t reach beyond a certain distance. When we passed near the entrance to the forest near with the wyvern, we tried to search in a limited direction, but it stopped after about 800 meters.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What do you mean by that?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「There’s something preventing me from looking for clues.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What do you mean, they’ve already built a 『castle?』」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「『Castle,』what’s that? Anorn?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「A 『castle』 is a…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The word 「castle,」 refers to a high level of warding, not necessarily a physical castle. The more advanced the defensive magic, the more it becomes a ward, and the more advanced it becomes, the more we call it a castle. In other words, they are used by archfiends and high ranking mages to create a space that suits them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The majority of castles are force fields that changes to some attribute, and some of them even twist space itself to create a portal to another world.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s what I am talking about…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s really bad, isn’t it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, the castle is bad, but it’s still probably at the level of warding. If it were a castle, this village near this forest would be affected in some way, and not only the Church of Arnelia but other organizations would be working on it. And it would take at least a few years to form a castle. But you said that the Archfiend was only confirmed a month ago, right, Albert?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s for sure. It is reported that there did not even seem to be any traces of warding at that time.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Then it’s not the castle, but the wards first. Historically confirmed castles have been formed in as little as three years. If you’re dealing with a monster that can build a castle in a month, you’re risking the destruction of the world.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn replied with a stern look on her face.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well, it’s possible that we’ve won the first lottery of the world’s destruction.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Wait, don’t say anything scary further!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Its&ndash;alright, it’s not going to happen!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She is already back to her usual cheerful face as Anorn lightly laughs it off.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well, let’s go to bed today, we’ll leave early tomorrow morning. Yeah yeah, I’m getting ready for bed.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As if hurried by Anorn, the group disbanded on the spot, and everyone dispersed. At that time,</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Anorn-sama, may I?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What, Albert? I told you not to call me with 『-sama,』 didn’t I?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It doesn’t work that way. I’ve already compromised myself.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What compromise?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Normally, I would call you Miranda-sama.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn’s face instantly became stern.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You… where did you get that?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Here, Miss Alfiris will ask you. I’ve rented a room in the corner, so I’ll be there. I’ve put a soundproof wall so Lisa can’t hear us.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「All right, fine.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn gave him a stern that she rarely shows. She had a look on her face that could have killed Albert if he hadn’t said it right. They walked quickly into the room, locked the door, and faced each other.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…So, who told you that?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn glared at Albert with the eyes of an enemy.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「From the journals of my ancestor, five generations ago.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That sexual harasser! I didn’t know you were so light with your hands as you are with your mouth! There are some templar knights like him, I’ll give them to that.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You have every right to be angry, but before you do, would you please listen to what I have to say?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert responded in an effort to sound calm.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Sure! I’ll rip your head off if that’s what it takes.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Much obliged… Do you know why we, the Lazaar family, exists?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Or course. Protecting the Master Bishop, right? Even with your life at stake.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That is true, but it is not quite what you think it means, Miranda-sama.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">A moment later, Miranda grabbed Albert by the collar and slammed him against the wall.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Who said you could call me by that name? Only the Master Bishop can call me by that name!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「My apologies… may we continue our conversation?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Tsk! Go on!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn roughly dismisses Albert and leaves in an embarrassed manner.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Our raison d’etre is to protect the Master Bishop. However, it is not only our lives that we protect, but Lazaar has been instructed to protect all of his, for all generations.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Everything? What do you mean?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t know how to say this, but it seems to be the first order of business when our family became Templar Knights, and those who cannot do so will not be qualified to bear the name of Lazaar. At the same time, it also means that those who do not have the ability to call themselves Lazaar do not have to belong to the Church of Arnelia. I can’t tell the exact reason at the moment, but I think the exact meaning is that we must 『never leave the Master Bishop alone.』」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What? I’m getting more and more confused.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn tilted her head.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「… Actually, the Master Bishop has been alive for over 800 years.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I know that… Wait, eight hundred years? Then…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「The current Master Bishop is the one who created the Arnelian religion. She said that shr didn’t know her exact age, that she must have lived for well over a thousand years, but that she didn’t know if it was 800 or so. She said that her memory of the past was slowly becoming fuzzy.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「So that’s what she said. I had a vague idea, but…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Eight hundred years. Eight hundred years, that is a long time to live. Anorn has lived for 300 years, but even she found 300 years disgustingly long.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(It’s been a long, long time since I became immortal. 300 years is disgusting, but 800 years…)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「She is a lonely person.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert continued.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「As you can see, she cannot tell anyone that she is immortal, and she can change appearance, and act as a different person every ten years or so for official events. It would be suspicious if the Master Bishop remained the same. She can pretend that her former self is dead, or she can simply pretend that she have left Arnelia, but either way, she will have lost everyone she know each time.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s something… I understand.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s why the first generation left this oral tradition. At least we wanted to be there for her, so that she would not be lonely. That’s how we understand it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I understand that, but why does it have to be the Lazaar?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">At Anorn’s words, Albert turns his slightly melancholic green eyes to Anorn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…Do you notice anything when you look at us?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…..No way!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s what I mean…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert made an unusually sad expression.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Of course, there were those who were not satisfied with the mission, but most of them stayed in the Arnelian religion in one way or another once they learned of the person’s situation. However, five generations ago, Richard-sama added to the mission of the Lazaar family.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…What?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「The first thing they must do is to serve the Master Bishop until the end of her life. And our second priority is to protect Miranda-sama. This is a matter of individual opinion, but she is worthy of serving as a knight and must not be lost. Her existence is far more important than our lives.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn was completely taken aback.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Eh… Richard, he never said a word about that to me…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn’s memory recalled Richard’s frivolous attitude.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(He touched people’s breasts, butts, and whatever else he wanted, but his eyes were always kind. When I was picked up by Master, I had lost all my will to live and was good as a cripple. Seeing me as a dead person, no one would call out to me. But come to think of it, it was Richard who first approach me&mdash; he always approached me when I was alone and depressed. So was worried about me… the he should have behaved in a more obvious way…)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn was grateful for Richard’s thoughtfulness, as it was answered a long-standing question. The only thing she was really annoyed about was the way he had touched her chest and butt.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But then why didn’t he just tell me that? I’m glad that he cares about me, but at the same time, he’s giving me a hard time. It’s a bit of contradiction in terms.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「The fifth generation’s memoirs are here. I think you will find the answer in here. It was his last will and testament, which he asked me to open after his death, when his wife and all his mistresses were dead. Would you like to read it, Ma’am?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Give it to me.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn was flipping through the journal she had borrowed from Albert. At first, Anorn was reading the journal without a second thought, but gradually her face changed to an expression of surprise, and she became pale, and then she began to tremble and finally began to burst into tears.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「N-no… there’s no way…! I… I&mdash; what a terrible thing I’ve done. I didn’t understand anything about him, about Richard. He was always looking out for me, worrying about me, and trying to be there for me!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">The tears that spilled from Anorn’s eyes showed no signs of stopping. Anorn grabbed at Albert, not even trying to hide her sobbing wet and soggy face.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I… I don’t know what to do! How can I repay him?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t know… but I read the same memoir and I think that maybe he just wanted you to live normally.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Live… normally…?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes. Maybe live a normal life, make friends, joke around, laugh, have a boyfriend…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s… I can’t do that now yet.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn slumped down. A silence enveloped them both.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…This is my personal opinion, but as long as you are alive, it is never too late.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「As long as I… live?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes. You have an infinite amount of time. You may change your mind someday, but if you go to get it back now, it won’t be too late.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I see… do you think so?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I can only say probably.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Albert continued as the knight knelt to his master.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You must survive tomorrow’s battle to know the answer. At all costs, you mui return safely with Alfiris and Lisa. You must not lose them. For that purpose, please feel free to use my life… I hereby swear to fulfill this promise; with my honor, pride, and sword. Whenever and however the Lord of Swords’ wills that my promise be fulfilled, return my life and my soul to heaven with this sword.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">He drew his sword, slashed his own fingertips, dipped the blood into the sword, and offered the hilt to Anorn. This is a formal knight’s oath, and is usually only taken to a loyal master.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn, or rather Miranda, closed her eyes and pondered for a moment what to do.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Albert Fidelity Lazaar, thou shalt receive the sword. My name is Miranda Ravenworth. I am the master of thy sword, and the keeper of thy life and soul. I swear to you that I will do everything in my power to make you worthy of my sword!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn does the same, slashes her own finger with the bloody part of the sword, kisses the hilt of it, and raises it above Albert’s head. Then, for three seconds, she draws his sword and returns it to Albert.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He then kisses the hilt of the sword and raises it above his head.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「It’s up to you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’re no different from him in that you’re so blunt…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m ashamed.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn smiled helplessly. It seemed to symbolize the loneliness she was feeling. But at the same time, Albert was very happy to have met her in his generation.</p>
<p class="calibre6">To be honest, when he had been told about his mission of the Lazaar family at a young age, Albert had not understood what it meant. He had been trained to wield a sword his entire life. Why would he have to give up all the pleasures of his life to do so? He was also not convinced that the person he would use the power he gained from his training on was predetermined from before he was born.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When he was fourteen, he was appointed to the Master Bishop’ guard. He was not a captain at that time, but serving Miliazar gave him a sense of the kind of person he should be able to use. And as he learned more about Miliazar’s personality, he was convinced that she was worthy of dedicating his sword to. For a knight, it is fortunate to be able to meet someone with whom you can bet your life. After that, he worked even harder on his sword training, but for some reason, he still felt unsatisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But Albert was blessed with talent. When he became an adult at sixteen and his father entrusted him with Richard’s journal, the meaning of wielding a sword became even more important to him. There were two people to protect. In his ancestor’s journal, there was a sketch of her. It was of the Miliazar of that time and a young woman smiling at each other. When he saw it, he understood, 「Oh, I was born to protect this scene, and I am training my sword.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">From then on, Albert’s training became even more intense. It was so rigorous that even the Lazaar family feared that Albert had lost his mind. But Albert was satisfied. He didn’t mind the pain he had to go through in order to protect that scene. Considering the fact that many people end their lives without knowing what they are supposed to do, he could think how lucky he was.</p>
<p class="calibre6">And now that he saw her, he realize even more strongly that there are people who are worth risking their lives for. He also shed some serious tears for his ancestors.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(Surely I would not hesitate to protect this woman even without his memoirs.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">That was Albert’s untruth. There was another thought that came to his mind when he saw the journal, but he decided to keep it quietly in the back of his mind for now.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「I never thought I’d see the day when I’d take the knight’s vow.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「They say life is like flowing water.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What did you say?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「My apologies.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn smiled. Seeing that smile, Albert was sure that he had done the right thing.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Then my first order as your Lord.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Anything you want.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I want the four of us to go home. And don’t you dare die!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, ma’am.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「And when we’re alone, you call me Miranda. I’m gonna miss having someone to call by my real name.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, ma’am.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「One more then! Turn three times and say one!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, ma’am.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Albert puts down his sword and starts preparing to turn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Wait, wait, wait! That last one was a joke!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「They say that once you say something out loud, you can never take it back. As a knight, I will only what the Lord tells me to do.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why are you so stubborn!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「When a knight is told to die by someone to whom he was sworn allegiance, he dies on the spot without question. Especially since I’m so clumsy.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Y&ndash;You, you know what I’m talking about! You’re a bloke knight and a pain in the ass, so stop it!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The two of them were making a lot of noise, it’s like the days when she used to fool around with Richard&mdash;&mdash; Anorn, or Miranda for this moment&mdash;&mdash; She thought to herself.</p>
<p class="calibre6">However, the soundproofing magic had somehow been turned off, and Lisa was listening to the joke. And the next day</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You had fun last night, didn’t you?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Lisa was teasing Anorn a lot. Alfiris had no idea what they were talking about.</p>

<p class="calibre6">In the meantime, the night was drawing to a close. They still don’t the fierce battle that is coming tomorrow.</p>
