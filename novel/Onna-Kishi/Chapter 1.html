<h1 class="calibre1">Chapter 1 &#8211; At The Town of Iz</h1>

<p class="calibre6">「Hmm, after leaving the forest wolf, you almost got kidnapped by a Kelpie, and you chose a tree as a bed, but the tree was also a monster? How dumb can you be?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’re so loud! You know I don’t like doing it either, right?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Here, they are at the Iz Town Tavern. The town of Iz is located in the middle of the larger towns of Dett and Mysia, and the distance between Dett and Mysia can be reached in about half a day by horse. For this reason, Iz is not profiting for its inn business, but a little further down to the south, there are coal mines and ore extraction sites, which serves as a base for those engaged in the mining industry.</p>



<p class="calibre6">However, the heyday of the mining business in Iz was more than 30 years ago, and those who want to make a fortune in rare metals have already left the area. Those who remain are natives and those who are not willing to leave the town, and when all these people gather together, the character of the land deteriorates. Although it was a little out of the way, it was an inn town on the main roads connecting the East and West, and yet it was unusually unsafe.</p>
<p class="calibre6">It must have been an hour since the sun had set by now. Even though it is a small town, there are not many entertainments, and on the contrary, this tavern, which is a lively place, attracts a good number of people. If there were two women of their age in the midst of all this, you’d would drunks to call out to them, but they all just glanced at them and didn’t call out. And for some reason, Alfiris thought she could see the fear in their eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Have you done something, Sister…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">This sister usually hides her face with a hood, but she is quite beautiful. She has blue eyes and translucent blond hair, and has the appearance of a member of the aristocracy in a large city. Because of the dangers involved in being a sister and a beautiful woman, pilgrimage sisters are accompanied by a temple knight or other escort, but this sister is traveling alone. Even the most naive Alfiris thought that this was dangerous, but this sister was a head smaller than her and had the same arm strength as the sword-wielding girl. Naturally, she also had the ability to match her skills. There was story of a man who got involved with sister when she was drinking too much was too pathetic to tell. If a young woman is traveling alone, it probably means she has the ability and reason to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Anyway, in this town where Alfiris arrived after escaping from the demons in a helpless state, this sister was waiting for her as she half expected. Alfiris had been teased a lot that day when she arrived, and she woke up the next day in the early afternoon, doubly tired. It seemed like a hassle to leave the town after that, so she decided to stay here for one more night to get some rest. Fortunately, she was not in trouble yet.</p>
<p class="calibre6">She really didn’t want to spend consecutive nights in an uncomfortable place, but she decided it was better than travelling back in bad health. That’s why Alfiris is being by this sister every day… At that moment, the sister’s eyes suddenly become serious.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「But then again, kelpies are usually only found in much larger rivers. And if it’s a small river, after it’s flooded, it’s only in the middle of nowhere. I think it could be a plant-based fiend, maybe a Treant or something, but the area where it appears is farther south. Maybe we should ask the Knights or the Church to investigate this when we go to the big city.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What do you mean?」</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/FgNb1MR/0024.jpg" alt="" />

<p class="calibre6">The sister replied, spinning an empty glass of water in her hand.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Okay? Normally, fiends have low intelligence and are unlikely to expand their range. Even though they may come back to reclaim their original habitat range. It’s only humans who would try to destroy their territory.</p>
<p class="calibre6">If a fiend were to expand its territory, it would be caused by a single species, such as a pack of forest wolves or goblins. When the habitat range of multiple fiends changes, as it did this time, there’s a good chance that a powerful being leading them is present.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「A powerful being leading them?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It means that there is a possibility that a fiend commonly known as an Archfiend, may appear.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「The Archfiend, you mean the one who almost destroyed the world in the past?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris asks half-heartedly. She had thought that such an existence as a Demon Lord was something only in legends. She thought the humans had already exterminated the Archfiend, but recalling it now, there she saw a sign on one of the guild’s requests that read「Defeat the Archfiend!」over it.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Anorn, however, disagreed with Alfiris’ opinion.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「That’s extreme. The continent used to be occupied by fiends. There have been Archfiends who have actually destroyed some countries after the humans became more powerful, but there aren’t any Archfiends of that magnitude currently. The one you’re talking about is one of the most legendary archfiends in history.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Generally speaking, a fiend that can control fiends beyond its species is called a Archfiend. That’s why the strength of an Archfiend can greatly vary. I’m sure there’s are at least four currently in existence that I know of.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「There’s that many of them.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「In fact, there are probably more. The smarter they are, the more they live in hiding. The ones that get the word out in human society are the ones that have nothing important to do, or the ones that are really big.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmm, I wonder if I can handle those four?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, I think you can’t do it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why not?~」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris complained, but the Sister’s expression didn’t change.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「From a historical analysis, it usually takes at least one division, 3,000 men, to defeat an Archfiend. And that Archfiend has an army that is more or less well organized. It’s a hypothetical situation if we’re going to be safe, so we often go out with a smaller number of people, and if a country has mages, it might be easier to hunt them.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In addition, I’ve heard that there are some heroes out there who are willing to take on the Archfiend with a party of few people, but there aren’t many of them in the world.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, yeah…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「By the way, didn’t you get a rank insignia or something like that from the mercenary guild?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I got something like this.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Alfiris pulled the rank insignia from her waist and showed it to the sister. The coat of arms had a picture of a small sword engraved on it.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Nnh… You’re in Rank E, the lowest rank insignia. You’re not a novice yet. Mercenaries are sometimes hired to defeat the Archfiend, but even if they are treated as miscellaneous soldiers, their rank must at least be Rank C. The first thing you need to do is work diligently as a mercenary, and rise through the ranks.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s true, but I need to follow my master’s order in going to the East.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Am I the only one who feels like you’re never going to get there?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Excuse me!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As you can imagine, she felt like she was being treated as a child, so Alfiris gulped down the fire wine, but as expected, she choked. Seeing her like that, the sister is grinning at her again.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You may be adult, but you’re not 20 yet, so don’t chug it. If you’re traveling, you’ll need alcohol to gather information, but don’t drink and get drunk.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Sister, you’re preaching to the choir.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s because I’m a sister. We’re supposed (not) to preach.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Sister smiles pleasantly as she said this.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Not at all… You know, Sister, you really know your stuff. How long have you been in pilgrimage?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s been 10 years since I left the monastery where I used to work.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What, then, you’re already thirty&mdash;」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Did you said something!?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The sister’s eyes were not smiling at all as she poured the liqour badly into Alfiris’ cup. Her instincts were telling her that any further pursuit could endanger her life. She rushed to change the subject.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「B&ndash;By the way, where would you go next, Sister?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m not here for anything. I’m going to Mysia at the very least because of the fiend thing.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m going to Mysia too… We’ll be together at least until then.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s right. I’m just a weak sister, so I’ll need the mercenary to protect me.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn winks at her, but Alfiris holds back from saying,「What weakness is within you?」 If she let her into that, she’ll have her drinking all night.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But will the knights listen to a single sister saying such a thing?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh. I know I look so fragile, but the only people who have a higher position than me in the church headquarters are the church members. If my position is that high, I can control of our sect’s country’s knights orders at my own discretion.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「R&ndash;really?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris looks at her in disbelief, but Sister Anorn responds with a look that says it’s nothing to be proud of.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「If I had known, I would have been in this position, to be honest. I wasn’t interested in the position, but it seems that making a pilgrimage like this by myself is very much appreciated at headquarters. ‘It’s a saintly task to do,’ they said. It’s not something a saint has to do. But there are a lot of strange people in charge of the headquarters.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I feel like there’s something wrong with the world if Sister was a great person…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why not?! As for me, I don’t want to be an apprentice, even if I have a position. There were a lot of applicants, but it was too much trouble, so I made one speech at the headquarters and everyone turned it down.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Just so I’m clear, what did you talk about?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Sister grinned at Alfiris, who asked cautiously.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「On how to handle alcohol and men while traveling.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…I can’t believe it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「The archbishop’s pale face was a masterpiece! The sisters fainted one after another from the brilliance of my speech, and it was a wonderful time.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m starting to get a headache…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She spoke with an angelic air. How can anyone see the true nature of this sister by her appearance?</p>


<p class="calibre6">「By the way, it’s all about me. Why don’t you talk about yourself sometime?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You know how boring it is to talk about me?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Not really. Seven years in the mountains is not normal, and when we first met, you were wearing a long underwear even in the summer, right? You caught my attention because you were dressed like that on that hot, shitty day. Well, there’s also the fact that you’re tall as a man, beautiful, and has black hair.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Sister, don’t say things like ‘shit’.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t change the subject, okay? Well, it’s not surprising that adventurers wear clothes to hide things underneath, but still, why not use robes and cloaks. You never show your skin to anyone… If you’re sick or you’ve done something wrong and you want to do penance, why don’t you do it in front of this sister? I’ll give you a discount.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">After saying that much, the sister grips the glass of liquor and drinks it down. Alfiris wondered if Anorn was going to ask her to do penance while she was drunk.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Do you take money as a payment? Well, there’s nothing for me to repent for… It’s not like I haven’t done anything penitent.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If you can tell someone, it’s easier to tell them. I’m a Sister as well, so I won’t leak the contents of your confession to anyone.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Um… Thank you. I’m not supposed to say anything because my master told me not to. However, if it has anything to do with Sister, I suppose I’ll make sure to tell you about it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well then, I won’t pursue any deeper than that. But in the summer, you’re going to stand out like a sore thumb. I’m sure If I knew more about your situation, I could at least lend my wisdom.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Just as Alfiris thought that she might be able to talk to this sister for a while.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Hey, Old man, drink up! Get on with it!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">With a sudden coarse voice, a group of people who looked very badly behaved entered the room. The people who hang out in this tavern are not the most elegant, but the people who have just entered are far more disfigured. It’s not good to judge people by their appearance, but what they do on a daily basis is reflected in their appearance. Alfiris hadn’t been traveling long, but she had been in harm’s way so many times that she’d developed a good eye for people and their dangers. The looks of the people who just walked in would be exactly the kind of people who enjoys committing extortion and assault.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Even if they didn’t see the danger, some of the other patrons left the bar quickly or made obvious gestures to avoid eye contact. They are quite dangerous. So, for those who can’t read the atmosphere, they’re the ones who aren’t qualified to travel.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I just hope it doesn’t turn out to be much trouble.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The sister’s eyes, which had been somewhat glazed over from drinking so much earlier, regained their sharpness. Alfiris felt that Sister was not someone to be underestimated.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I think I’d better go back to my room.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「They sat down and walked next right to our seat? On the other hand, this is the corner. If you don’t stand out, they won’t see you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, I think you’ll stand out more because you’re a sister.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s true… Hey, there!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">The sister called the men in front of them. Then,</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Heh, what is it, Old Lady?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Call me Sister. I’m going to get a bunch of big, burly people to keep these bad-looking dumb faces out of my sight. I can’t stop drinking.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「O-okay.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She heard a bunch of big guys scoffing and moved.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(What can this Sister really do to me before I arrive there?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It’s no wonder Alfiris is thinking she’s not sure what to do here.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What’s an anego?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Just let that slide, okay? Anyway, that’s enough. It’s best to not get involved with those people.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「If I get involved with the Sister, I might have more luck than they do.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Disreputable.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s true.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As the two of them followed such an exchange, it wasn’t long before they heard an obvious threat from those tough guys.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris is having a drink with Sister Anorn, a familiar face from her travels, at a tavern in Iz. But then the tavern is invaded by a group of ruffians…?</p>

<p class="calibre6">&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hey, hey, hey, youngster, did you say something, hah!?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I didn’t say anything.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’ve been staring at us, haven’t you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Are you picking a fight, good for nothing bunches!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Who did you call good for nothing!?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris and Anorn, who had just decided to ignore them, looked at each other without either of them knowing. The men around the two were whispering to each other, and it seemed that the men who had just entered the tavern were, as they had suspected, are known for being infamous. A young man was being tangled up with these men, and the men that Anorn has tried to send to him were still hesitant.</p>


<p class="calibre6">Well, even though the man is young, he may be older than Alfiris, but he might be just a greenhorn. If the two hadn’t taken them serious, they might have backed off, but they’ve been talking back. Although Alfiris and Anorn could only partially see what was going on, they could tell that there was an unsettling atmosphere in the room.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn muttered softly.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That kid is no good.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Anyone who can’t gauge the danger of their opponent brings will earn a quick death, whether it’s on the battlefield or not.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Such a blunt thing to say. I think it’s normal for youngsters to be so vigorous. How many of these guys are here?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「When they entered, I saw six. Two of them were blatantly dangling their weapons. The guy with tangled rat-like face and the one who looks like a badly made horse have hidden daggers in their pockets. The other two have knives on their boots. I think it was his own fault for doing something that attracted their attention. If he can’t fight, then learn a way to avoid fighting, he reaps what he sow.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris responded smoothly, wondering when in the world she had confirmed this. Anorn had been watching Alfiris for a long time, but she only put her eyes on them for at most two seconds when they entered the tavern. While having doubts how she was able to identify them that much with so little time,</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I feel bad for making a fool out of her.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She changed her mind. Though the forest wolf discussion ended up with nothing more than that funny story, it’s still a forest wolf&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m not sure if I’m able to overlook this… I’ll go help him.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Fue?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Just as Anorn was about to get lost in her thoughts, Alfiris stood up and walked towards the center of the dispute. The suddenness of the situation caused Anorn to give a rather dumb reply, but even she did so, Alfiris was already walking quickly toward the ruffians.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hey&mdash;! Looks like I don’t have a choice anymore.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Thinking that she would be able to provide at least some support if the need arose, Alfiris followed her. Perhaps she really thought that it would be more interesting to follow her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You guys, it’s time to stop this.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Who the hell are you, bitch?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Who cares who I was? You’re bothering the other customers.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「More importantly, you’re all annoying me.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris thought that the Sister was making unnecessary comments, but she did not look at the rat-faced man. But it seems she was right to intervene immediately. That man was on the verge of pulling a small knife from his pocket. The young man who got caught up in this mess probably didn’t notice the danger incoming to him. If it had been pulled out, it must have been a situation that could not be easily contained.</p>


<p class="calibre6">The horse-face man shouted at Anorn and Alfiris.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That runt called us good-for-nothings. We’ll have him pay for what he had said. Get out of here, you bastard. Oh, right, you’re not bastards but bitches.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">His friends are laughing vulgarly at Alfiris. They may be trying to provoke Alfiris, but she’s not stupid enough to let herself get carried away by something like this.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「This is a tavern, a place to drink. Picking a fight over the words of a drunkard is unadult-like. I will treat you both, so please leave it at that and drink merrily.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Such a well understanding sister you are. I mind if you do. But, you’ll be the one to pour my drink… Keke.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m sure the liquor won’t taste good if a big woman like me was the one pouring it. I’ll tell the barkeeper to serve you a slightly better liquor, so be satisfied with that.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Indeed, Alfiris is tall, about the size of an average man. Even so-called “big girls” are beautiful, but Alfiris is not aware that she was, and a certain incident has caused her to have a complete complex about her height.</p>

<p class="calibre6">The horse-faced man made eye contact with the rat-faced man and smiled disgustingly.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Then I’ll let that Sister there to pour for you instead. Hey, Sister, come here!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「No, I don’t think you should bother Sister. I’m telling you seriously.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I can’t do this, I can’t do that, who the hell are you to order me around? This kind of bad mood isn’t going to be cured by a big girl like you pouring it out!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris although didn’t realize, while popping a vein on her forehead, but a drunkard isn’t someone that can’t be reasoned with. But still, things seems to be getting worse than before.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(If anything, why is Sister is following me here? It’s going to make things worse!)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Now, the situation is already moving in a direction different from what Alfiris had plan for. There’s no way these ruffians will only pour a liquor to Sister, but more importantly, there’s no way that Sister will quietly pour liquor to them. Just as she was thinking this, she heard a cat-calling voice out of nowhere.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ara, please wait a moment. I’ll bring your liquor to you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Sister knows what’s she talking about huh.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「(Eh, is that Sister’s voice just now?!)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It was the most affectionate voice Alfiris had ever heard from Sister, but, it sounded like she was overacting a bit. If it hadn’t been for this situation, she definitely would have blown this up. When she looked at Sister Anorn, she was wearing a big smile in her face, but her eyes… Her eyes are telling the opposite. The young man who had been tangled up earlier seemed to be able to read the Sister’s expression, to see what was going to happen next, he backed away slowly. It was a good guess, the man can’t imagine Alfiris wondering if there was a similar conclusion brought up before his. And as for the rat-faced man, Alfiris looked at the expression on the man’s face to see if he noticed anything, but it seems that his head is filled with nothing but obscene fantasies of what he would do to Sister Anorn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(This is why for those drunks… I don’t care what happens to you, okay?)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Despite Alfiris’ concerns, Sister Anorn is as friendly as if she were a regular customer.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Oh, the alcohol has been served. Is it alright if it’s on me?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「No, no, I’ll buy you a drink, and in return, you can serve a drink for me.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The man was already in a good mood because of unexpected beauty of this sister. Maybe it’s just a trickle for them, but they don’t realize that a huge bomb is going to explode in front of them.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Please look this way, so I can pour it for you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Alright, alright.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t forget your own cup, okay?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Then, it would be easier if you could keep your head a little lower.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Keep my head down… You’ve got some beautiful legs there, Sister. So, why do I have to keep my head down?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, of course it’s because I’m going to do this?!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Sploosh!</p>

<p class="calibre6">The people around them, who had been watching anxiously to see how things would turn out, couldn’t help but gasp. Even Alfiris couldn’t help but to gasp as well. This sister, of all people, cracked a man’s head open with a bottle of liquor. Completely taken by surprise, the rat-faced man was jerking and twitching around the floor.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「You bitch! What the hell have you done!?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmm? Can’t you see that I cracked his head open with a bottle??」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「T-That’s not what I meant. I’m sure that a sister isn’t supposed to do that!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t want to waste my precious sermons on you lowlifes. If I crack your head open like this, you scum might be able 『to meet the Lord.』 It’s my way of giving mercy to you bastards an easy path to heaven, don’t you understand?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The sister snickered. The men were beginning to turn pale rather than being angry from Anorn’s words.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「T&mdash;This sister is crazy!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What the fuck are you talking about! Lousy as all you xxx addition xxx bastards, I don’t really think that you can all handle me. I’d be more concerned about that weakling than you lot. Go home, bury yourselves with your friends there, you damn xxxx!!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">In a very un-sisterly rant, Anorn sticks out her middle fingers towards them. Alfiris and the others are now completely rough around the edges. This sister seemed capable to be fighting on her own.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ho&ndash;How dare you say that! I’ve got a complex about it!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">‘You’re worried about things like that!?’ While Alfiris was thinking about that, one of the men tried to attack by grabbing her. ‘I’m going to complain this to her later’, Alfiris murmured in her mouth, afterwards her body started to deal with the man.</p>


<p class="calibre6">She grabbed her opponent and swept him off his feet, then she slammed her fists down on the unbalanced man’s neck. Alfiris kicked the desk into the back of her legs faster than she could swing, and of the men had dodged the desk was about to pull the knife out of his boot. Just as the man was about to raise his eyes to her while pulling out his knife, a scream erupted from him.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Gu&mdash;! Gyaaaah!!!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Just before the man looked up, Alfiris stomped on the handle of the knife from above with her weight. The knife went straight through the man’s leg and pinned him to the ground.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「T&ndash;This woman!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">They thought that they could handle it well, so they each took their own distance and pulled out their pray. The people around them were panicking, and as expected, Sister looked at Alfiris with concern, but she was calm and collected.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I think you should stop now. Three of you won’t be able to fight me back. Get that injured away and scram from here.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ve still got my sword here, and you’re just barehanded!?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh my. Three large men with weapons can’t even handle an unarmed woman is a pretty embarrassing situation to be in, don’t you think?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Shut up! Don’t you think you can run away after this!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Alfiris sigh heavily and somewhat deliberately apologized,「I’m sorry.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Then, try it you can!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">A moment passed, with a whoosh, one cut was going to her. She jumped backwards in one step, dodging the sword, grabbed a bottle of liquor that was lying around and smashed in into the side of his head. A man with a knife comes at her as the man before him rolls over holding its face, but she swings a nearby chair against it, caused him to be blown away; and without pausing, a man with a sword slashes down from above. This time she was off-balanced as well, but she twists her body to evade him and she put her hands on his arm to accelerate over him. The sword didn’t stop, but it had cut the man’s inner thigh instead.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Guhii&mdash;!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She kicked the man in the groin, causing the man to slump in agony, vomiting out the food he had eaten.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Now that you understand, I suggest you to get the hell of out here. I’m not sure if I can hold myself back on you, okay?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「D&mdash;Dammit!!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, make sure that you bring the injured as well, right?」</p>


<p class="calibre6">From the sidelines, things concluded instantaneously. It was so amazing that the others who were looking for an opportunity to join in were unable to do anything, they were simply stunned. Sister Anorn also raised her bottle(obviously bigger than before), but she lost her composure and looked unsettled. She wondered if Alfiris was planning to cover her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hey, get a hold of yourself!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t think that this is over, you bitches!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If you want something worse than what you’ve got, I’ll give it to you.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The men who were slumped to the ground, supported by others, began to flee in a rush. The people around them were already laughing uncontrollably, amd they could hear them chuckling.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Oi, you forgot this!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Gyaah!!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">And then, what happened next was that the sister threw an empty bottle of liquor at ruffians scurrying away from the tavern.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You&mdash;, You’ve gone too far, Sister!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I realized you’re more naive than this. It would have been better if they were all crippled. Those kind of people are very resentful, and most of all, they are persistent.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t commit indiscriminate killing or violence. I mean, whose fault is it that things turned out the way it did…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Before she could even finish her words, Alfiris was surrounded by people rushing towards her from the tavern.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Onee-chan, you’re amazing.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I haven’t felt that good in a long time!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s my fault, I’m sorry.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why don’t you take this drink with you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「This old me is so relieved. I’ll give you a free booze and free lodging as well!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was in a pinch, and is currently being jostled.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「W&mdash;Wait, everyone, please calm down! Sister, do something!?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ehh~? I don’t even know you.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">The unsympathetic sister walked upstairs. Leaving Alfiris troubled on the first floor, surrounded by people.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Considering the recriminations, I should leave this town first thing tomorrow morning… Well, I’ll come back to help you for a little while. Anyway…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It had been a year since Anorn got along with Alfiris, but this was the first time she had seen her fight. She knew that Alfiris would be strong when she first saw her, but for her to able to defeat many people in an instant. Moreover, while being barehanded.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「But when I think about it, it’s not surprising. That girl, I wonder if she even knows how strong she was.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">That’s right, Alfiris said she had defeated a three meter tall forest wolf without breaking a sweat, but forest wolves are usually the size of an adult male, sometimes larger than that. Even if it was the leader of the pack, it must only be one size larger, no more taller than two meters. It doesn’t belong to a pack, and at three meters, it was probably the master of that area. This was an individual who will become an archfiend at an early age. She said that she did not kill it, but beat it almost unharmed, and even negotiated with it to become her pillow.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Fiends will only negotiate with someone who has something to offer them. If she had file an application to the guild, she’d definitely be above B-rank. What a waste. Addition to that, she also had black hair. Meaning that she can use magic, certainly.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">In this age, the average folk’s hair color was chestnut. Most of the aristocrats have blonde hair, claiming it was because they used to interact with the gods or a race of blessed by gods and succeeded in having children, but the truth is not clear. The reason for that was because the concept of a God in this continent is very rare.</p>


<p class="calibre6">Those who use magic may also see changes in their hair color depending on the nature of their manifestation. For example, those who had red hair will manifest flames, and so on. Of course, this doesn’t apply to everyone, but to those powerful enough on doing so.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Being a mage is enough to be an honor, but more often than not, there are people who dye and change their hair color, since magic is usually one system per person and showing it is just the same as revealing your weakness in a battle. And as for dyes, black is generally more readily available and widespread. Therefore, those with black hair are proof of high ranking mages or those who show an affinity for dark magic.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「If she can use magic in addition to her swordplay, I’d be more cautious… Although, I don’t think she can use any dark magic, but just in case, I might need to know who her master is.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She glanced down at Alfiris from upstairs, Anorn was lost in thought. While she found her naive and endearing, she was beginning to think otherwise because of the real nature of her job, Anorn really needed to ask Alfiris for more information.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’ve become a detestable woman, huh? I’ve also got a lot of secrets of my own.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris would’ve been surprised if she saw Anorn now. She was looking at Alfiris with a very sad face, a very unlikely expression that came from the foul-mouthed, violent sister.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Alfie, wake up!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「T&ndash;The sun hasn’t risen yet…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Didn’t I told you yesterday that we should leave the town early? Get yourself awake now!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ugh, I’ve had drink too much…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris, who had become very popular after defeating the ruffians yesterday, was surrounded by people in the tavern and was totally drunked. At first, she tried her best to refuse their offers, but the innocent Alfiris has no skills in dealing with a crowd of drunken and moody men.</p>
<p class="calibre6">When Anorn went downstairs to check on her about half an hour later, she found Alfiris in a helpless state, saying something like「Bring me more booze!」 As expected, Anorn thought it was bad to leave her there, so she managed to rescue Alfiris and forcibly took her upstairs to her room and put her in bed, but she was in no condition to give her anything to sober her up.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「We can’t afford to take a bath, so I just fetched some water for you to wipe yourself with, okay? I’ve prepared some sobering and tonic pills for you, so go ahead and take them. I’ve also arranged the food and horses, so I’ll go get them. Once you’re ready to go out, head to the east gate, okay?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Okay.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Alfiris could still see that she was sleepwalking, but she had regained enough energy to decide that it would be better to leave the city as soon as possible, just like Sister said. And what’s more, Anorn’s deftness and kindness was enough to make Alfiris to make her believe that she was Sister.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Even though you can’t use recovery magic.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I CAN HEAR YOU TALKING YOU KNOW!!!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Kyaaa!?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris was just about to change her clothes, so she hurried to cover herself.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s not like there’s something gonna lose in you, since we’re both woman.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Wait a second. I thought you were going to get the horse. I didn’t sense you coming back.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Erasing my presence is easy as pie.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Where did you learn that!?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If you’re still not ready in a quarter of an hour, I’m gonna leave you behind, you know?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It looked like this time, she did have gone to get the horses. The sound of shuffling, rough footsteps are becoming distant.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「She didn’t see that, did she? These curse marks…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">When Alfiris was given this imprint by her mentor, she was told to never show it to anyone. The reason for this wasn’t clear to her at first, it was her body after all. As she studied more and more, it kind of made sense to her. Later on, as she was taught and experienced various things, she recognized that it was something she should not show to others for clear reasons. Alfiris knew that if she were to accidentally let others see this mark, she might be targeted for extermination.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I don’t know how I got myself into this…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris unintentionally resents her misfortune, but she still thinks she is grateful to have met her master. She know that it is almost a miracle that she was alive and living a normal life. Normally, she might have been disposed of if she didn’t met her master at the age of ten. If she thought about her own safety, then secluding in the mountains would be the best thing to do.</p>
<p class="calibre6">However, her desire of wanting to know the world more had prevailed. She’d like to experience something like love as much as anyone else. At just eighteen years old, Alfiris’ soul was filled with youthful vitality, could taste the freedom of outside world.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn, on the other hand, was thinking as she made her own preparations.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I hope that kid took those medicines.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Anorn was considerate of Alfiris, who was surprisingly sloppy, she headed to the stables. She is a sister, yet she’s unable to recovery magic. Instead, her knowledge of medicinal herbs was the best within the church, and she was proud of it. Also, due to her training, she is quite skilled in magic against fiends and undead. She have never regretted not being able to use recovery magic, because she learned self-defense and she’s proud of her abilities as an adventurer. Except for one certain situation.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well, I’m not originally fit to be a Sister. Yes, yes, Horsie, good boy, good boy~!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As Anorn walked out of the stable, pulling two horses at once, she heard a dusky voice behind her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Don’t you move, you goddamn sister&mdash;!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">At that time, Alfiris, who had finished her preparations quickly, was already waiting for the Sister near the gate. Dawn was breaking and the gates of the town would soon to be open. That said, Sister’s medicine was very effective. Alfiris was already aware that her condition was returning to normal.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Perhaps it was because Alfiris was too occupied to talk to him, but a gate guard came up to talk to her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Hey, young lady. That was a painful yesterday, isn’t?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Do you know me, Mr. Gate Guard?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「This old me was at the tavern last night. Although, I didn’t see the mess but I could tell that it was a lot of fun, dont’cha? When I asked someone about what happened, she told me that a beautiful travelling swordsman had knocked out those rascals. They’re from this town, they’ve been misbehaving ever since they were just kids. They don’t work, they just plunder at night, and rumors has it that some of them even killed people. I was just wondering if there was anything I could do about it.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Is there not any vigilantes over this town?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「There are some, but they’re more numerous than us. By the way…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Twenty people, maybe?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s all of them. Wait, how did you know that… A-wa-wa&ndash;!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The old man who was guarding the gate backed away involuntarily and the first one to escape. The rumored people from the old man’s story has gathered near the gate. And this time, they were all armed to the teeth.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’ve heard that you messed with my men yesterday.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">An unusually large man spoke up. As he stood in the front, she thought that it was their leader.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Oh my, I’m not worthy enough to take care of this many men by myself.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Aren’t you calm right now. You’re surrounded by more than ten men and you didn’t seem to flinch at all.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「So, what can I do for you? I’m about to leave the town soon, you know?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Come on, don’t be like that. These guys from yesterday wanted to thank you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What a boring way to deal with a thank you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Don’t worry, I’ll make sure you’ll have a good time. Right on my hip, hihihi~」</p>


<p class="calibre6">In the meantime, the men were closing their distance on her. This time there were fourteen of them. Alfiris couldn’t help but sigh, wondering if this was how it was going to play out at the end.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I told you not to move!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The man’s voice was futile, and Sister showed no signs of slowing down at all.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Don’t ignore me, you bitch!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The man grabbed a piece of wood from around the corner and threw it at her, but she dodged it without even looking behind her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s dangerous. What are you going to do if you happen to hit my precious horse?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You better worry about yourself than your horse!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What am I supposed to worry about in front of the guy who got knocked down by me yesterday?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s because I let my guard down yesterday! I’ve got friends here today, so it’s not going to be like yesterday.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn looked closer and saw that it was apparently the rat-faced man from yesterday. She was completely uninterested in this man yesterday that she had almost forgotten his face. Indeed, there are about five of them today. Completely armed.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Nah, it’s already less than yesterday, isn’t it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What do you mean?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I mean, six big men with weapons are surrounding this weak little sister. That’s already not something a man would do. xx You bastard. Oh, you’re not even a man xx you fucking faggot. I don’t know, it’s kind of rude to be a faggot.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「D&mdash;Dammit, you fucking bitch!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, this fucking bitch! What a nice way of putting it. Too bad, though. I’m not ordained, I’m just…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Shut the fuck up!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The rat-faced man swinged a slash at her, his face were turning red. Anorn, on her part, was looking at the man with a refreshed face and her right hand on her hips as she lunges at him. Just when it looked the man’s sword is going to hit the Sister. Klank! The man’s sword was stopped with an exceptionally high metallic sound. The man’s sword seemed to have cut off the sister’s left arm. Or at least, that’s what the man had intended.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Wha…」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Just as the man was about to say something, there was a dull thud as if something snapped, and the rat-faced man’s body flew in the air. That’s not it, he was completely blown through the air. The man’s body, which had partially broken through the wall at the end of the stable, no longer moved a muscle.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Oh no&mdash; Did I go too far?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Wha, wha, wha…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The remaining men’s face were pale. It doesn’t seem like a real scene for them. The body of the large man was blown away by the strike of a not-so-large sister, a distance equivalent to several horses. They turned their attention to the sister, and before they knew it, she has a cudgel in her hands.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You know, I am sister, but it was different before. For some reason, I changed my name and occupation. But, I find being a sister to be useful. The clothes are fluttery, which is great for hiding weapons, and catches your opponents off guard. What’s more, it’s 30% more clean and neat.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">And so on, while winking and talking lightly. This Sister is someone that should be feared by men.</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn spoke to them with a huge grin on her face.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well, I am a Sister, and I’m not going to kill you. Besides, I’m afraid of being chastised by the Master Bishop, if I overdo it. But I’m sorry if xxxx crushes your balls and makes you all an eunuch♪」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hiee!!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Sister Anorn happily chased down the men, and the five of them, despite being of fully armed, their hands were trembling as they hold their swords. Those who hunt and those were hunted had now its roles completely reversed.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">And around the gate…</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Gyaah!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The two men who had tried to grab Alfiris first were blown off from the wrists up, where they had been holding their swords. While everyone was dumbfounded, there was a *hyum!* Alfiris readied the whip in her right hand.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Y&mdash;You bitch, aren’t you swordwoman?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I never claimed to be a swordwoman. It’s just that I’m mainly used swords, and if you’re travelling, there are many situations where you’ll be forced to fight in many-to-one or mid-range combat. This is my countermeasure for that.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris’ stance was lean as she spoke. Everyone can see even to the untrained eye that the way she handle the whip is skillful.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Surround her, you bastards! The whip can’t swing in multiple directions at the same time. Surround her and attack at once!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The men spread around and surrounded Alfiris.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I see. That big guy sure knows his way of leading around.)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris observes her enemies, keeping a watchful eyes on her surroundings. If she was surrounded, she would be certainly be at a disadvantage, but it was useful to defeat them all at once.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Let’s go!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">With a shout, the people surrounding Alfiris attacked her all at once. Still, Alfiris had calmly swung his whip and struck four men in front of her in the face with the belly of her whip. In general, the killing power of a whip is limited to 10 centimeters at the tip, but if someone used it skillfully, it can easily rip off a person’s head. However, if even the belly of the whip was hit in the face, the pain would be very hard to ignore. As expected, the people who were hit in the face all cowering.</p>

<p class="calibre6">But the others didn’t stop. Without moment’s hesitation, they scattered the powder they had taken out of their pockets behind her. The men who were about to jump on her from behind took the brunt of it and cowered in place while screaming. It was an eye dropping pollen from a specific plant. The two remaining swords were then swung at Alfiris, but she managed to catch them with the cuirass of her left hand. As soon as the two men realized that they could be caught, a hidden blade appeared from the hand armor and sliced through their faces. The men squirmed as blood spurted out of them, and Alfiris was hit by some of the blood, but she didn’t blink and was completely unfazed.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Wh&mdash;What the hell?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The remaining of them couldn’t hide their shock. In a matter of few minutes, eight adult men were beaten by one woman. The leader of their group couldn’t hide his shock as well.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I’ve never seen such a capable person… There were no female mercenaries like her on the battlefield. Who are you?)」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「This&mdash; This is no good…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">When all but the man who seemed to be leader of the group turned around and tried away, something blew in the wind.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Ahh… Ahh…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The men then suddenly fall down. He look at them and see that looks like a dagger stuck in their backs.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Don’t worry, it’s a paralyzing agent. They won’t be able to move for a whole day. No one’s gonna die. Well, it’s hard to say that they’re safe, but they had it coming.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Who the hell are you?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m just a simple traveller. There’s nothing special about me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ve never such a capable person like you before.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Let’s take your words as a compliment. So what are you going to do, gonna resist? Or let yourself be arrested by vigilantes quietly?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I don’t hold back even if it was against a woman. I won’t give in over my sword!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The big man readjust himself and slashes at her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I don’t have any choice huh?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris also drew her sword and strike. She leaped backwards to dodge the man’s sidestroke. She evaded another uppercut as she rushed forward, and struck the man in the face with the hilt of her sword.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Guh&mdash;!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As the man retreated, she slashed at him.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「(From above!)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The moment the man held out his sword to block Alfiris’ uppercut&mdash;</p>

<p class="calibre6">「The sword, what happened to the trajectory of the slash?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris’ sword changed its trajectory so that it dodged the sword that was trying to block it, and slashed down in a kesa-gatame (scarf-holding) way. The man cowered holding his shoulder.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Why…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I can’t be this dexterous with a sword that I swing with the intent to kill, though. And if you’re in a battlefield, you don’t want take a sword to a sword, because you’ll end up destroying yours. Remember that (I’m just borrowing my words from my master, though).」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「D&mdash;Dammit!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">As the man kicks away the dropped sword with his foot, a figure that looks like a vigilantes comes in pieces.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Are you alright, young lady?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh, Mr. Gate Guard. You’ve gone to call for help?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Isn’t that obvious?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But it’s all over now. They should be all alive, so make sure you take them in.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Oh my god…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">With residents of the town unable to fully comprehend the situation, Alfiris returned to her original posture as if nothing happened and muttered to herself as she collected the weapons she had used.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Sister, you’re late… What are you doing this whole time?」</p>
