<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Alfiris' Past and the Secret of the Curse Marks</h3>

<p class="calibre6">「You completely missed your chance to leave…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The sister in question had quickly taken care of her enemy and was watching the situation unfold. By the way, the people who attacked her were beaten up to the extent that their faces could not be recognized, and they were all thrown into the manure pit of the stable.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「An eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth, a bitch for a bitch.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Such a doctrine, of course, does not exist in the church to which Anorn belongs.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You’re really a strong fellow, aren’t you? Aren’t you strong as the battalion commander of our Templar Knights? Besides…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The dagger she threw had an unusual distance and power, and Anorn thought it couldn’t have flown like that for nearly 20 meters,</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Ahh, there you are, Sister!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Wah.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn is surprised when Alfiris suddenly calls outs to her.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Sister, can we go now before people start asking questions? I don’t want myself to be coaxed again.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I, I understand. Then, let’s go now.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Somewhat bewildered, Anorn brought the horses to her. The two of them get on their horses and was rearing to leave the town as soon as possible. But just then, they were approached by an old man who was guarding the gate.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You two.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What is it, Mr. Gate Guard?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You seem to be in a hurry, so I will not bother you. You’re going to stop at Mysia, aren’t you? My son runs an inn there. If you want to stay there, you can show him this old man’s letter. Think of it as a free lodging.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Really? Thank you, Ojii-san!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s nothing, I’m sure that this town will be a peace for a while. It’s a small price to pay for that.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ll be grateful to use it then. Well, grandpa, what’s your name?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s Bis.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Thank you Bis-san, I am Alfiris. I’ll see you when I get the chance!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yeah.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Bis, the gatekeeper, smiles amd waves them off.</p>

<p class="calibre6">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre6">After that, they left the town of Iz and went on for a while, but the sister were talking uncomfortably little. When Alfiris spoke at her, she mostly gave half-baked responses. Alfiris wonder about Anorn and looks at her with some concern.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What’s wrong, Sister?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Nhn, no, it’s nothing.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Are you sure it’s nothing? You’re not feeling well, are you? Shall we take a break?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m alright… No, let’s take a break.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">As if making up her mind, Sister turned to Alfiris. Alfiris regained her composure, wondering what was going on.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Let’s go to that rock over there.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">There are many grasslands in this area. Since it is located in the middle of the continent, it has always been open, and there are a quite few people passing by. They could see troopers in front and behind them, and many horses whinnying. Unable to sit on the road under such circumstances, the two of them wemt a little off the road and sat on an unpopulated rock out of sight of the road.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Anorn reluctantly broke the ice.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Alfie, I know this may be a difficult topic to answer. Can I ask you something?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「As long as I can answer those questions…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris must have sensed the importance of the topic. Her expression was serious.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「This morning, I’m sorry to say, but I saw some of the marks on your body.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「As I expected. So then?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Your Marks is not a normal one. It’s a tribal ritual, or sign of guilt. There’s also witchcraft, and a family history. In some countries, even royalties use such marks as a proof of their kingship.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m not an expert, so I don’t know the details, but yours was some kind of curse mark. And it’s a kind of sealing spell that seals magical powers.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…Then?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「A seal mark is the strongest kind of mark that can be placed on the body. It interferes with the circulation of magic power in the body, so it puts a lot of strain on the person, but it is very effective. And they’re all encroaching on your arms, isn’t it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…There’s also on my back and some on the chest.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s how powerful your magic is. It usually only takes one line of arms to circle around, and an ordinary magician would be unable to use magic for half a lifetime. You’ve sealed such a thing over a large capacity and yet you still used magic, didn’t you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What makes you think that?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「The distance of the dagger you threw. It couldn’t have flown that far for the way it was thrown. You must’ve used some kind of wind magic or something.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s far as you can go. So, what are you going to do? Do you want to get rid of me now?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s up to you」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn’s eyes become even sharper.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What do you really want to do? When you have that much power, you can do almost anything, right? You can be an official in your country, or you can reside to the Magic Association. No matter how you do it, you can become anything you want. If you want, you can use your power to control people and reign like an Archfiend.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You see…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris suddenly gets a faraway look in her eyes.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It’s as if I don’t know what I want to do, what should I do… I have no idea.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">She began to pontificate.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I was born in family of farmers. We weren’t poor, but we grew up in a very ordinary house where we didn’t have to worry about food for the day. But I had unusual powers. When I was little, I didn’t even think it was wrong to use my powers for my own good.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn stared at Alfiris with a serious look on her face, as if she was measuring the person.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「It was partly out of my control, but it finally led to someone’s death. It was a defeated soldier from the war who had lived into our village. I couldn’t miss the part where he tried to rough up the villagers… but that was a bad idea. Not long after that, I was surrounded by a multitude of mages.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">That was the way it was supposed to be in the world where Alfiris lived. In the past, mages were valued as a force against fiends and archfiends, but back then, there were mages who manipulated countries and tried to wage wars all over the world. The mages were defeated, but after that incident, which caused a great loss of life, people became aware of the dangers of magic, and were often treated unfairly by the general public.</p>
<p class="calibre6">The rift between the ordinary people and the mages deepened to the point of suppression and persecution, but the mages tried to regain the trust of the people by their keeping their own control. The Magic Association was created for this purpose, and it is now common knowledge that those who possess strong magical powers must be more strictly disciplined and controlled.</p>
<p class="calibre6">For this reason, the Magic Association has decided to sanction those who try to misuse their magic power themselves, without exception. It has a department that specializes on hunting mages.</p>
<p class="calibre6">But on the other hand, everyone has the power of magic by nature, though the power may be small or large. Normally, it is only through specialized knowledge and proper training that magic can be manifested, but occasionally, some people are blessed with the innate ability to use magic. Those who are so gifted are usually detected through astrology and precognition, and are taken to the right place shortly after birth. Normally, a person with the power to drive people to their deaths would not be left unattended, but in the sense, Alfiris was an exception. Heresy, as what might people say. Being blessed with talent is not always a blessing.</p>
<p class="calibre6">While Anorn was thinking like this, Alfiris continued to speak without hesitation.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I think there were about ten mages. Even so, my magic was much stronger theirs and I defeated them in no time at all. Ahh, I didn’t kill them you know? I was strong enough that I didn’t need to be. Then my master walked by.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「By the way, what’s the name of your master?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Aldorius.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Is that Aldorius Serck Rezalwark?!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s right.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">There are many world-renowned mages, but the one named Aldorius was special. He manifested tremendous power at a young age, but abandoned the practice of magic when he was only 20 years old. After leaving Magic Association, he joined a knightly order in a certain country, and this time through martial arts, he rose to the rank of a legion commander, one step closer to the rank of general.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He was also a great civil servant, and his ideas are still used as a reference throughout the world, especially in the field of domestic affairs, such as flood control and city planning. He was popular with both the court and the people, and was even given the title of Count by the King, but for some reason, in his mid-thirties, he gave up of all his positions and ran away. He disappeared into the unknown.</p>
<p class="calibre6">He is also a somewhat of legendary being, although he is considered as a weirdo and an eccentric in that people don’t know what he was thinking. Alfiris being raised and taught by such a person was far beyond Anorn’s imagination. No, it would be better to say Alfiris definitely needed someone that great to guide her.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Alfiris continued speaking.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Master easily defeated me. He’s mage, but he’s also a top-notch martial artist, so he was freakishly strong. And then, I was put under the care of Master, and I was spared on the condition that I live in the middle of nowhere. There were many other circumstances, but Master didn’t talk about them. It was then that Master placed this spell on me.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris then rolled up her sleeves. But as Anorn sees it, the form of the pattern on the right and left seem to be different.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Do you see the difference between the left and the right? The one of the left is the spell mark applied by Master. The one on the right, I did it myself.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「By yourself? How is that even possible? It’s more than that… It’s insane!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">A curse mark demands a great price for both the one who applied it and the who received it. For the practitioner, it is the loss of some function, such as the loss of taste or shortened life span. And for those on the receiving end, it is an immense pain that never goes away. Therefore, curse marks are usually used to seal off archfiends and other powerful demons, or as the highest for of punishment for sinners. That’s why, it’s unbelievable for someone to apply it to themselves.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Alfiris’ expression was so cheerful that she didn’t feel the gravity of the situation in the slightest. On the contrary, this was painful for Anorn. Alfiris, realizing Anorn’s inner thoughts, spoke in a hushed tone.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「There was no restriction of functions, though. Instead, every time I tried to use an amount of magic power sealed by the spell, the erosion of the spell would intensify.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s&mdash;!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, every time I use my own magic, the pain goes stronger.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">It’s not something that can be easily said. Anorn shuddered as she imagined how much pain Alfiris was in.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Don’t look so worried, it’s not that big for now. If I don’t use magic for a long time, the pain will gradually go away, and since I haven’t used it for the past few years, I haven’t had any pain at all. Sometimes, it will throb again just to remind me.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris smiled faintly and explained on Anorn.</p>


<p class="calibre6">「Because of the spell he casted on me, Master’s lifespan has been shortened. Master was the first person who really cared about me. But it’s almost as if I killed him.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s my Master’s wish. He said,『live your life according to your heart’s desire.』 I thought over and over again that he should have said one thing against me. But Master treated me like her own daughter. That’s why… He’s more important than my own parents. I found out later that it was my own parents who tipped the Magic Association about me. That’s why the Curse Mark that applied to myself is like a vow to my master. To never forget what he did for me. Otherwise, I might end up hating my own parents.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Alfie, you…!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn turned her grieving eyes to Alfiris, but Alfiris pretended not to notice her at all.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So, I’m going to do to others what Master did to me. I’m going to use this power for someone else. If I have this power, there might be someone I can saved. I don’t what’s there for me, but I’m going to find it out myself. I’m not going to use it for my self-interest. Even if you kill me here, right now.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why the hell do I have to kill you, Alfie?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「But you could have killed me if you wanted to, couldn’t you? Sister is much stronger than me. And isn’t that what Sister do for a living?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris is staring directly at Anorn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(This girl… How much did she know about me?)」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Anorn didn’t know either. It just seemed that Alfiris is much more perceptive than she had imagined. Alfiris continues to talk without regard to Anorn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Sister have the mannerisms of a warrior. I think that kind of thing is obvious for those who know it. Sister said that you were curious about me when you first saw me, and I was the same, you know? But for some reason, at first glance, I didn’t feel like I could win, even if my opponent was a sister and she’s helping people after all. It was the first time in my travels that I had an opponent that I didn’t think I could beat, even if I gave it my all. I may be naive, but my instincts as a warrior were pretty good, okay?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’re right… I knew that you were not ordinary. But you’re assuming too far, I’m not that strong. And that’s why you have black hair, isn’t it?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I wonder~ My intuition is pretty good. By the way, my hair is dyed black, as you can imagine.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Anyway, what is your original hair color?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">At Anorn’s question filled with curiosity, Alfiris looked a little troubled.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That’s… I can answer that, but can you tell me about yourself as well, Sister?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Me? It’s alright, but there are things I can’t answer due to my own circumstances.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Then… Were you really a sister?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s true. My proper identification is with me, here.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s really true. And a bishop? Above the bishop is…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Assistant Bishop, Archbishop, the one and only Master Bishop.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Alfiris rolled her eyes, and Anorn shows off her chest a little proudly.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「She’s really a prominent person.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Now pay respects and bow to her!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I &mdash; don’t &mdash; want &mdash; to &mdash;!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Alfiris gave a loud「ee」 to Anorn. Anorn was a bit taken aback by her childish gesture compared to her age, but she isn’t 20 years old, and she has lived without any friends of her own age in the mountains during that time when she wants to have fun the most, so probably hasn’t had this kind of interaction at all.</p>
<p class="calibre6">To be honest, Anorn didn’t have much of an intention to fight Alfiris, but she thought it was unavoidable if she was left with no other options. She knew fully well that she must and should be cold-hearted as she needed to be. It was an experience that Anorn had gained, being a warrior for so long.</p>
<p class="calibre6">In fact, Anorn sometimes took on the task of subjugating fiends as part of her pilgrimage work, and when reinforcements were not able to reach her in time, she occasionally carried the subjugation mission by herself. But looking at Alfie’s gestures, she could be sure that even if she tried her best to kill her, Alfiris will never use her magic, and Anorn was slowly losing her motivation to fight. Anorn had come to consider this much younger, almost child-like female swordsman as a worthy companion.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So, what are you going to do? Do you want to? Or not?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ehh, let’s see…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Contrastingly, Anorn was troubled when Alfiris asked her if she wanted to fight.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「If I say I wanted to, what will Alfie do?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Hmm. I don’t want to die, so I’ll resist, but I don’t want to think about killing you either, Sister.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s the same for me. I don’t even want to think about killing you.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Why not? Isn’t that your job?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Excuse me. My work is certainly different from that of an ordinary sister. Ordinary sisters are assigned to a specific parish, and their job is to pray in a convent or church, or to serve in an orphanage or hospital. As for me, I’m just taking on a much more dangerous jobs.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Like what?」</p>


<p class="calibre6">In response to Alfiris’ question, Anorn put her hand on her chin and made a slightly distressed gesture.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Let’s see… I’ve been to areas that are not yet under the influence of our church to test the range of missionary work and service, and to investigate the causes of destruction. I’ll negotiate with the city and the state if necessary. Aside from that, we’ll investigate whether our activities are being carried out properly in areas under the influence of the church. Unfortunately, even in an organization like ours, there are also people who were driven by self-interest. In my case, I’d even go so far as to investigate the fiend’s movements. Well, I guess you could say that I’m an investigator.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「So, how long have you been doing that?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「It’s been less than 10 years…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「So, then you’re not 30 anymo&mdash;」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What &ndash; did &ndash; you &ndash; say &ndash; !?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I&mdash;It’s nothing! I’m just minding my own business here!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Seeing her veins popping on Anorn’s forehead, Alfiris quickly ran towards the forest.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Don’t get too far than here, okay? Wait, am I her babysitter?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn let out sigh,「Huh.」 She felt as if Alfiris had successfully diverted the conversation, but she decided to leave it at that. In all honesty, Anorn personally likes Alfiis quite a bit and is willing to give it a little more thought.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I personally think there’s any danger&mdash; I don’t think the higher-ups would judge it that way though. I guess I should at least report the existence of such a person, but even just letting her know would limit her activities a lot. The archbishop, for example, is bald, but so stubborn.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I don’t think that baldness had any connections on being stubborn on the head.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, you’re right… Wait, who are you?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">She looked around, but she didn’t see anyone. But before she knew it, there was a little bird perched next to Anorn.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「You twerp, have you forgotten the voice of your Lord?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s why I’m asking you? I mean, where are you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I am right in front you, twerp.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">There was a little bird staring at Anorn. For such a little bird, its eyes are unpleasantly sharp. It was a small bird, but it had a strange aura about it. The look in its eyes was also somewhat familiar, Anorn thought.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「A&mdash;Are you serious…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Yes, I’m serious.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Am I going crazy?!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, you’ve always been a little crazy… Wait, that’s not it!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Finally, the small bird pounced on Anorn and began pecking at her with its beak.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「What is wrong with this bird? I’m gonna roast this whole thing and eat it!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Twerp, is this how a sister act? Do I have to chastise you again?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That way of talking………….. Is that you, Master Bishop?!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You’ve finally figured it out, you idiot!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The little bird began to puff up, as if it was proud of itself because of Anorn’s attention. Anorn thought it might be a little cute, but she remembered that the inside that little bird was a figure of cruelty.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Anorn suddenly asked curtly.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So, how long have you been there?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’ve been observing you for a month now. Using this body of a bird.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Are you bored?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m not bored! Or rather, it’s because I haven’t heard anything from you in almost nine months. I thought I told you to report to me every three months. What have you been doing all this time?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「That&mdash; That’s, teehee~」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「This is not a good time to say『teehee!』I’ll tell you what, you suck at this you know? I’m really pissed off about this.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The bird’s eyes become sharp. For some reason, Anorn feels intimidated by this palm-sized little bird.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「By the way, I’m on my way to Mysia.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Geh&mdash;」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I want you to be in town by sundown. I’ll need a report coming from you, but a new mission was given.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「If it’s something I need to report, I’ll quickly do it.」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn’s expression changed to a serious one.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「So you understand. It’s about the possibility of a new archfiend, alright?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「! So, you already knew that.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Who do you think I am? I have eyes and mouth scattered all over the place. If you want, I can replay the contents of the『x』 you slammed in the tavern last night right here.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Pl&mdash;Please don’t do that.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I can do that. Moreover, I can even tell you the color and the shape of your underwear you’re wearing today, you know?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Are you sexually harassing me?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What sexual harassment are you talking about, when you’re totally a sister and you’re wearing those obscene things. If I see what you’re carrying, my church’s reputation will be tainted.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Please don’t!!!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Apparently, Anorn had always been uncomfortable with the Master Bishop. She didn’t feel like she could win in a war of words at all. It’s something that can’t be helped. Because without the Master Bishop, she would have no idea what tomorrow brings to her. Anorn did not forget the favor she received from her a long time ago.</p>
<p class="calibre6">Then, as expected, the Master Bishop begins to mention Alfiris.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m talking about your companion, by the way.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Y-Yes!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn gets even more rowdy and sits upright on a rock.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「(I guess she deserved to be noticed. You were with me. She’s very strict about heresy and disturbing the peace. There’s no way that nothing will happen to her. But if the person stares at me, there’s no way that I’ll find a safe place to escape. If she was caught by this person, it’s gonna be my fault…)」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The sweat running down Anorn’s back was disgusting. Unexpectedly, however, Master Bishop’s response were very simple.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’ll put it on hold for now.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Ehh?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Don’t make such stupid noises. I’ve determined that there is little danger.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Wha- What…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「You disagree?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「No, I didn’t!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn denied it in a panicking manner.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「By the way, Aldorius and I had some interaction. The person who raised her would never make a mistake. At least, not from him. And have you forgotten the tenets of my church? Charity is one of them, remember?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s true, but isn’t that girl a heretic?」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Anorn asks the Master Bishop with trepidation. But the Master Bishop’s voice is calm.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「We haven’t had a case yet, and we’re not likely to be having one either. I’ve been listening to a twat like you for so long, and I’ve never found a single lie in what you’ve told me. If such people were to be punished, the world would be full of sinners. Even if she was a user of dark magic, it’s not because darkness is necessary evil. Instead, it is our duty to lead them in the right direction with a spirit of compassion. Am I wrong?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Y……. Thank you for your generosity!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Sighing, Anorn was relieved, but the Master Bishop makes a sharp point.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well, you twat seem to like it, so you’ll have to see what happens to it. As long as we’re together. But you’ve been lying to her, haven’t you?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What do you mean?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What do you mean, for less than decade? When it’s actually several decades? It must have been hundreds years since I assigned a twat like you to your current mission.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「That’s… Even if I were to be honest with her about that, she wouldn’t believe it…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">Seeing Anorn nod, Master Bishop soften the tone of her voice.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「I’m not so sure about that. That girl said,『I don’t know why I don’t feel like I can win.』 Maybe she instinctively saw that you are immortal.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I, I doubt that…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, it’s up to you whether you want to say it or not. But, if you truly want a friend, you should say otherwise. At least you won’t end up like me.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Master…」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Well, that was a bit much chatter. It seems that Alfiris is coming back. Make sure to remember to arrive in town before the sun goes down. By the way, if you don’t make it time, you’ll get an embarrassing chastisement!」</p>


<p class="calibre6">Those words made Anorn jumped up.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Embarrassing chastisement, a&ndash;are you serious??」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Kukuku, the one I’m talking about. When I did it to you brat a long time, you cried so hard… That’s why I’m looking forward to it now. I don’t care if we don’t get there in time&mdash; You don’t mind, so you? I don’t care you didn’t make it. Kukuku…」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The little bird grinned at her with a scowl. It is sure that birds doesn’t have the muscles to laugh. Anorn felt that she had seen a very unpleasant vision. Maybe she would dream about it tonight.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Well then, I’ll be waiting there!」</p>

<p class="calibre6">The Master Bishop said a lot of things she wanted to say and went away in a flash.</p>

<p class="calibre6">「Such habit of a bigwig, how noisy… Hmm? Speaking of which… Master? Which part of city where we are gonna meet? How am I supposed to find the Master in a city that big? We’ll never gonna make it there! What bad luck.」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「I’m back~ Hmm, what’s wrong, Sister?」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「Follow me quickly, Alfie! My chastity is at stake!!」</p>
<p class="calibre6">「What, I don’t get you at all.」</p>


<p class="calibre6">The two of them hurried to get their horses into town. Needless to say, the Master Bishop was observing the two of them, including this panic.</p>
