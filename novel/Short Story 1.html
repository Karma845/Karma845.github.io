<h3>Short Story &#8211; One Day with Nazuna</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
the basement of Naraku.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"SUR,
true vampire knight Nazuna, level 9999," is walking alone with big steps.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
red eyes and long silver hair swayed each time she moves.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
first glance, she looks like a daughter of a noble family, with her short body
and large breasts. Contrary to her appearance, her words and actions are full
of energy.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
my Lord ordered, I must protect Naraku while my Lord is away!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">To
be precise, she is the strongest in "Naraku" in terms of battle
ability alone. Due to her stupidity, she lacks the ability to respond to
emergency situations and cannot be entrusted with internal affairs. That's why
she stays in Naraku.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
doesn't mean people look down on her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
cheerfulness is recognized by everyone in Naraku, and she is a great
mood-maker.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
just that everyone has their own strengths and weaknesses.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As a
result, I asked her to protect the dungeon while I'm away. I'm sure no one can
reach the deepest part of Naraku, but it's always better to be careful.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Today,
she is taking her daily patrol for her beloved Lord.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
fairy maid who is cleaning calls out to her.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hello,
Nazuna-sama."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Are
you out for a walk, or are you on patrol?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ou,
that's right!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">I'm patrolling the basement of Naraku,
and I'm doing a very important task ordered by my Lord!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
proudly puffs her chest out as if to say, "Isn't that great?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
fairy maids, who understand their Lord intentions, praised her.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
expected of Nazuna-sama!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"With
Nazuna-sama watching over us, we can do the housework with peace of mind."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Awesome
Nazu!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ehehe,
don't praise me like that. I am just doing the job that my Lord ordered me to
do."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
is humble, but the praise makes her grins.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
is happy to be praised and to feel that she is contributing to Naraku and
helping Raito.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
level 500 fairy maids manipulate the level 9999 Nazuna.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Have
you decided where you want to go next?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
I haven't decided. Why?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Actually,
there's one place I want Nazuna-sama to check out."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
a very important and top-secret place, so the fairy maids aren't even allowed
to go near it."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Is
there such a place in Naraku? Well, whatever. And what kind of place is
that?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
fairy maids are grinning.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"That
place is--"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
is humming with enthusiasm as she heads to her next destination.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
place she is heading to is.......</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre8">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre8">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre6">☆</span><span class="calibre13"></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
fairy maids told her where to go next, and she knocked on the door of the room.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
few moments later, the door opens and SUR, Mei the seeker maid level 9999,
comes out with her long black hair swinging like a tail."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"?
Nazuna? Why are you coming to Lord's private room?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
patrolling here!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
answered Mei's question with a bright smile.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
answer was so straightforward that Mei doesn't know how to respond to her. She
quickly holds her head from a headache.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">On
the contrary, Nazuna asks her with innocent eyes.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"How
about Mei? What are you doing in Lord's room?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
It is against the way of my maids to not clean the room even if our Lord is not
using it. So, I was cleaning and tidying the room. So there is no need for you
to go inside."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Oh,
I see, as expected of Mei!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
nods with satisfaction with Mei response, but soon she has new questions.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"But
it seems like you were lounging around in your master's bed and sniffing his
pillow. Wouldn't that make the sheets and stuff wrinkle?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"............"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
time, Mei pressed her temples.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
is one of the strongest persons with level 9999, but her opponent is Nazuna,
who has the same rank and the strongest in Naraku.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">No
matter how hard Mei tries to hide her presence, she can't hide from Nazuna.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
Mei quickly regains her composure and speaks with her usual facial expression.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Don't
worry. I've developed a unique method for making the bed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
can't tell you the details because it's a secret technique."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"So
it's a special technique for housekeeping! As expected from Mei, the first person
summoned by my Lord. You even have a special technique for housework!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
nodded several times and looks impressed. She completely believed Mei's answer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
is pressing her temples again. Her head is aching.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"?
What's wrong, Mei? Do you have a headache?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
I'm fine. But I'm not sure if I should ask you to use your brain a little more,
or should I remind you to think more calmly......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
don't really understand, but if your head is aching, get some rest. And I have
a message for you from the fairy maids who asked me to check my Lord's
room."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
Hou, what's the message?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
narrowed her eyes at her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
says the message casually.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Eeeto...
[No monopoly on cleaning the Lord's room], [We also want the right to clean my
Lord's room], [1 vote against head maid's clean duty monopoly], [Explode,
please], [Explode, explode, explode]. The first part may mean that it's not
good to work too hard, but I don't know what the second part, 'explode' means."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
This problem is between me as the head maid and the fairy maids, so Nazuna
doesn't have to worry about it. So please tell me the name of the fairy maid
who complained to you. I will deal with them later."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal6"><span class="calibre13">"OK!
Eeeto..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
tells her the names of the fairy maids who complained about Raito's private
room cleaning duty.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
listening to all the information, Mei takes out a reward from her item box.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you for your cooperation. This is not much, but it's a token of gratitude.
Please buy some snacks and eat them while you're taking a break from your
patrol."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you, Mei! Mei is a good person! If you have any problems or need my help, let
me know. I'll help you!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
doesn't understand Mei's intentions. She took the money and left Raito's
private room.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
her back was out of sight, Mei immediately started to move to have a discussion
with the fairy maids.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
receiving some money from Mei, Nazuna stops by the store and buys some snacks.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
store is lined with N-card foods and other items from Raito's "Infinite
Gacha" benefit. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Otherwise,
the N-cards would just keep piling up.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
currency is unique to Naraku. Before this, Raito subordinates made a lot of
counterfeit money, since now they have no work, so he gave them the task of
making special money for Naraku residents.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
sweet she purchased is her favorite dorayaki.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
ate various chocolates, cookies, and sweet and sour sweets, but dorayaki is her
favorite.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
moves to the cafeteria and eats it with a bottle of milk that she bought.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
finishing her delicious meal, she proceeds to the training ground.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Aoyuki,
what are you doing in this place?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"……Nya."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
walking through the corridor, she sees one of her colleagues, "SUR, Genius
Monster Tamer Aoyuki Level 9999".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
greets him with a friendly attitude, but Aoyuki's expression and voice look as
if to say, "I've met a troublesome person......."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
Nazuna does not care about such things.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Anyway,
there is no way Nazuna would notice such a small detail, so she called out to
her without hesitation.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Didn't
my Lord ask you to investigate the forest around Naraku?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Oh,
maybe you've already finished? Aoyuki, you're working so fast!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nya~"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
Even if you say 'nya~', I'm not our Lord, so I don't know what you mean."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
doesn't understand Aoyuki's cat language either.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
just guesses from the voice tone and atmosphere.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
it's impossible to expect Nazuna to pay attention to such details.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
ponders why Aoyuki, who is supposed to be investigating the forest, is walking
in this corridor.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hmm,
oh! Could it be that there is a monster in the forest on the ground that even
Aoyuki can't beat, and you've come to ask for help? Then I'll take care of
it!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
confidently said with a smile.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Aoyuki
was summoned before me, but I think I'm older than you in terms of strength and
appearance. You can rely on me without hesitation!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"............"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Aoyuki
is the second person to be summoned from the Infinite Gacha, after Mei.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
Nazuna pointed out, if the two stand side by side, people will think Aoyuki is
the younger one. Because of their difference in height and breast size.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">That's
only if you don't know the inside...... needless to say.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Aoyuki
feels exhausted by Nazuna's misunderstanding and raises the map in her hand.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No.
There is no enemy. The map is partially finished, and I'm on my way to deliver
it to Mei."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Oh,
really? You should have said so from the beginning, but Aoyuki looks
different!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
laughs as she slaps Aoyuki back.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Aoyuki's
back hurts, and she doesn't even understand what's so funny.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
not that Aoyuki dislikes Nazuna.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
Nazuna is so stupid that makes Aoyuki wondered, "Is this person really a
level 9999 who became my Lord's hands and feet?". But her cheerfulness is
natural.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">To a
certain extent, Aoyuki does appreciate her as a mood maker.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
since Nazuna is a dog person and Aoyuki is a cat person, basically, they just
don't get along.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Aoyuki
is aware of this, but Nazuna doesn't even realize it.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nya."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
if to say she's done her business, Aoyuki quickly leaves Nazuna. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Just
like a cat.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
says positive words to her back. </span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Good
luck."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
is completely unaware that she and Aoyuki are not in harmony. In fact, Nazuna
even thinks that she has to protect Aoyuki because Aoyuki looks younger and
weaker than her.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
straightforward kindness is one of her good points, but it is also why she and
Aoyuki don't get along well.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
finishing her conversation with Aoyuki, Nazuna went to the training grounds to
patrol as planned.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
the end of beautiful corridor. She enters a rugged area that looks like the
original dungeon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
was not left behind due to a development error.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
was left untouched as a training ground.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Space
distorts, and a witch's hat appears.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Immediately,
Nazuna frowned, which was very unusual for her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
training area is much larger than the other rooms, so there is plenty of space.
This is why it is often used as a transfer point when transferring from outside
to the basement of the abyss.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">That's
also why Nazuna is checking out this place every time she is patrolling around.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Gee,
Elly. Didn't you go out there to do some inspection or construction work?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
not a kid like Nazuna. Of course, I came back because I had finished that work.
You are really stupid, aren't you?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
not stupid!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
and Elly are the closest in terms of the timing of their card releases.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Perhaps
that's why they often joke around when they see each other. Unlike Aoyuki, they
are so close that they quarrel with each other.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In a
way, this is one of Naraku's uniques.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">To
tease Nazuna further, Elly tells her a very special story.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
other day, I had tea with God Raito alone to inform him about my work progress.
Aren't you jealous?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Oh!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Seriously,
I'm jealous! If I have the chance, I also want to have tea with my Lord!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
Is that all?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"?What
else do you want?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly's
plan was to make fun of her and make her more frustrated, but Nazuna's honest
envy disappoints her.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Sometimes
her innocence makes her more difficult to deal with, but Nazuna herself is
completely unaware of that.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
time she does it again, and Elly can't help but fell silent.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
doesn't understand her feelings and just proceeds their conversation with her
own topic.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hurry
up and start executing the Sasha Revenge Plan!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Elly
is good at magic but not very good at close-quarters battle. If you need any
help, just let me know, and I'll help you!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You're......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly
is completely KO (knocked out) by Nazuna's straightforward and caring comment,
and she can't say anything more. Nazuna tilted her head, but Elly sluggishly
waved her hand and left the training area to do her work.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
watched her back and tilted her head, but she didn't understand Elly's actions
and just kept tilting her head.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
the end, she didn't understand Elly's actions. She would soon forget it as she
continued her patrol.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">That's
Nazuna's good point.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre8">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre8">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre6">☆</span><span class="calibre13"></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
finishes her daily work, patrolling.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
eating and taking a bath, she returns to her room and crawls into bed.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Today,
I'm glad I can protect Naraku and everybody as my Lord ordered!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
only problem is .......</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
miss my Lord....... I can't wait to see my beloved Lord. If only I could get
his permission, I would destroy everyone on the surface world."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Raito
and the others have stopped her, so she puts up with it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
she is determined to kick the crap out of anyone who troubles her master.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
wish I could see my Lord tomorrow. ......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
wishing that, Nazuna dozes off and begins to fall asleep.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"My
Lord ...... good night ......"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
whispers her closing words for the day and falls asleep.</span></p></div>
