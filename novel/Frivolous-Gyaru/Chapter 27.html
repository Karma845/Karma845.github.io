<h3>Chapter 27 &#8211; School Caste ③</h3>

<p>So this is what it means to have you blood run cold.<br />Abruptly getting off the bed, Tachibana and I stood with our backs straight like a new recruit hearing his name during a roll-call.</p>
<p>– What kind of thing is this...?</p>
<p>As the teacher in charge with long black hair said this in a low voice, the atmosphere in the room became freezing.<br />It still hasn't been long since the class shuffle, so this is the first time having a decent conversation with this teacher. But what a sense of intimidation. This person is tall and her look is so excessively sharp, that it's scary how it seems that she can make you fall silent with one glance.</p>
<p>In addition to that, a pair of boy and girl were caught in a suspicious act in the infirmary by the terrifying demon teacher... Isn't this a terrible situation? I swear that I haven't done anything. It's just that by some course of events we were lying on the bed next to each other.<br />But... Shiraishi-sensei probably will not be content with such an explanation.</p>
<p>I would rather it quickly ends with a punch, but in our times it will not be so. Rather, it's stressful that I have to wait for a more troublesome treatment.</p>
<p>– So... How is Tachibana in a place, like this...?</p>
<p>I gulped, while the silence was prickling my skin.</p>
<p>Or rather, her eyes, so scary! What kind of a male sergeant are you...!?</p>
<p>She seems like someone who makes hard harassments, yeah. "<em>Before and after the shit oozes out of your mouth, say 'SIR!'</em>" or "<em>You bastards are not human beings, gathering the shit of amphibians is the only worth you have!</em>"</p>
<p>I'm not only ready to shit myself, I'm ready to hand out everything I have in my wallet.<br />Ah, the amount I have with me today is not even 1,000 yen, it doesn't seem I'll manage to bribe her.<br />Oh that, are you okay with internal organs? Please eat my pancreas.</p>
<p>... It's impossible to say it for this tall female teacher, who unsteadily stepped closer.</p>
<p>She stood in front of Tachibana who was standing closer to the entrance first.<br />Blonde girl wanted to deceive her saying "<em>Weeell...</em>" and laughing, but sensei's cold iron-mask face hasn't relaxed, so the mood remained heavy.</p>
<p>– You were having quite a fun, huh...?</p>
<p>– Um... Umm...... I heard Ichijou was hit in the head, so I came to check on him, or something...</p>
<p>– Hmm...</p>
<p>Tachibana replied looking downward.<br />Right, it was you who made the dive. I was simply recuperating here, so it is unfortunate, but I cannot take responsibility together with you. You will have to face the fall alone.</p>
<p>Yet... Because of the few words that Tachibana has put forth, sensei went crazy in a different direction.</p>
<p>– And then... We played for a bit...</p>
<p>What's this "<em>played for a bit</em>", I can't follow it at all.<br />Rather, the verb 'play' itself has an uncertain meaning, so there is much room for imagination. In truth, she just said a few foolish words, but they are the words that can make you think in slightly wrong direction.</p>
<p>And practically, our Shiraishi-sensei too -</p>
<p>– What...!? You... <em>played</em>...?</p>
<p>While slightly trembling, her face became red.</p>
<p>– When you say played... You mean in a place like this infirmary, you two alone were doing some kind of wrong things like this and that...</p>
<p>...Mm? This appears strange...<br />Somehow, the atmosphere has changed. I feel like the dignity of a sergeant that I sensed until now has vanished.</p>
<p>And by the way, this teacher, isn't she a bit too flustered?<br />"<em>We played</em>", I don't know what she has imagined from that. Rather, what has she imagined?</p>
<p>However, at any rate this person is an adult woman. Being reminded about an unseemly thing just a little, and she already seems exaggeratedly surprised...<br />I can slightly smell something sad. Beings of the same kind can be seen through, and I know it very well.</p>
<p>– Oi, Ichijou...!!</p>
<p>– YES!</p>
<p>– Give an explanation on the circumstances of this matter!</p>
<p>Dreadful Shiraishi-sensei was standing before my eyes with a frightening expression.<br />And she's close, too close! Her breathing is heavy and her eyes are round open.</p>
<p>However, an explanation... How should I do it? I'm a little embarrassed...</p>
<p>– Eeh... We just spoke a little...</p>
<p>– Not true, Tachibana said you were playing! It seems to me you have conducted something you have a guilty conscious for in a place like this! It cannot be that she has called a simple chat playing. It's too god of a story if you say you only talked!</p>
<p>– No, no, nothing like that! It is entirely contrary to the truth!</p>
<p>– Truth? Speaking of the truth, you bastards were sle-, sle- sle- sle-... sleeping together!</p>
<p>– Well, it may have certainly seemed so...</p>
<p>– Awawa! So that was indeed sleeping together, what an insolence...!</p>
<p>Where has your usual cool impression gone? Letting out a "<em>Sleeping in the infirmary... together...</em>", sensei was constantly blinking.</p>
<p>Tachibana was just foolishly laughing with a troubled face and not making any objections. Well, she was lying next to me, but isn't there a context to everything...</p>
<p>– Fu, fufu, that is illicit sexual relationship! I'll be watching you bastards from now on...</p>
<p>After all, sensei tramped out of the infirmary with a bright red face.<br />It's just as if we pissed off some really serious kid. What is our teacher in charge? This conversation had a slightly worn-out feeling to it. I ended up seeing a bit strange side of her.</p>
<p>And in the end, Tachibana scratched the back of her head, embarrassed.</p>
<p>– Weeell, we messed up, huh...</p>
<p>– Oh, shut up!</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the punishment of writing an apology has fallen onto me too.<br />After the homeroom that day, I received 10 sheets of A4 blank forms even though there are tests next week. I desperately tried to make an excuse, but it seems one has to properly show one's point in written form. Shiraishi-sensei's eyes were bloodshot.</p>
<p>– Listen well, Ichijou. If you want to claim innocence to the very end, then elaborately describe the circumstances of the matter. In what way exactly have you played, what have you been talking about and what how much space was between you, what would you have done if I hadn't come?</p>
<p>– Sensei... Your breathing is very rough.</p>
<p>– It is not rough! This is very important, do you understand!</p>
<p>– Yes...</p>
<p>This person, even though she is an adult woman, she totally gives a virgin impression. I wonder if she is married...<br />I was quietly thinking so, but anyway, such being the case, I had to write a statement of regret after school.</p>
<p>Still, Tachibana was in high spirits just as usual.<br />Because of you, both of us have to write 10 A4 papers, why are you so happy? I have asked her this, but</p>
<p>– Because, you know, this is so absurd (lol). Even though we were scolded for getting along too much, aren't we still happily writing the apology together?</p>
<p>– Uh, from the viewpoint of how it looks, it is so...</p>
<p>– And that means that the more we get scolded, the better we will be getting along♪ Therefore, I want us do more things that will get us scolded.</p>
<p>– Stop... That is undeniably going too far.</p>
<p>– No... Don't say that that is going too far... That will cause me trouble.</p>
<p>What trouble, do you still want to escalate this? My head is about to boil just from that.<br />Rather, that is exactly the reason why we get the attention.<br />Up until now, I have been behaving like an honor student only in regard to the teachers and have been living peacefully, but what should I do now?</p>
