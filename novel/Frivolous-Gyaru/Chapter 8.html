<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; First Date ①</h3>


<p>– Coming to a date wearing track suit... Unbelievable.</p>
<p>– Weeell, I am a baggage guy. I've thought I might as well wear something comfortable... Haa, sorry. In truth, I had some unavoidable difficult circumstances, um, I am deeply ashamed...</p>
<p>Prostrating myself right from the beginning. I have nothing to say except I was so helplessly stupid.<br />By the way, this is actually a date. I'm shocked.</p>
<p>Date or not, how do you even come up with an idea of going out with someone wearing a track suit.<br />I have certainly got worked up by my aunt's instigation yesterday evening. But whatever the circumstances, a damn track suit, I am such an idiot. Oh, and for your information, this track suit is sparkling as I usually don't exercise.</p>
<p>Should I say naturally, but Tachibana was noticeably dissatisfied.<br />She was faintly groaning and pouting her lips.</p>
<p>It appears that she has absolutely no intention of laughing off my first-class century blunder.<br />"<em>It's not funny at all, virgin</em>" - I can see it in her eyes. I'm sorry for being alive.</p>
<p>– ...Forgive me, please...</p>
<p>Having as much spirit as I would need to kowtow, I dropped my shoulders.</p>
<p>How should I explain it to her?<br />Everything is the result of me being foolishly fixated on the thought "<em>This is certainly not a date, I'm just going out to do my job</em>". Now that I think about it, I was worrying myself like a brat. I think that even second year students of junior high trouble themselves over more important things.<br />Obviously, there is no way I can tell this girl that I had such thoughts. After all, she will just make fun of me calling me a virgin.</p>
<p>– You... I knew from the beginning that you can be saddening, but not that it was to this extent.</p>
<p>– ... I have nothing I can say, that is true.</p>
<p>Contrary to me, Tachibana had a refined outfit, making me feel excessively guilty.<br />When I first saw her today, I shivered at how smart she looked.</p>
<p>Didn't flashy girls always like to wear fluffy clothes?</p>
<p>Navy blue top and knee length white skirt, a chic outfit that doesn't match with her usual speech and conduct. However, her composed outfit contrasted with her flashy blonde hair, but didn't spoil anything, giving instead a refined impression. It even gives a somewhat adult feel. Come to think of it, her black tights and tight garments emphasize her body line. Her chest and rear are properly bulging leaving me troubled with no place to look.</p>
<p>Beautiful girl with a stylish outfit and indeed saddening track suit boy.<br />When the two stand facing each other, it produces an unexpected, strange scene.</p>
<p>Moreover, we are at the train station square where public gaze is unavoidable. Curious looks from the passersby are very painful to me.<br />Additionally, Tachibana's blaming look is seriously on the freezing level.<br />What a disgrace. I want to kill the me from yesterday. Should I just die? Look, if I just go there...</p>

<p>Having such thoughts, it seems my mind is on the verge of the break.<br />My sloppy mind came up with a thought, which my mouth absent-mindedly blurted out:</p>
<p>– Please, forgive me. I'll do anything you want today...</p>
<p>For a moment, there was silence between us.</p>
<p>With a <em>hmm</em>, blonde girl in plain clothes put her finger on her chin seemingly thinking of something.<br />After hearing my miserable proposal, her facial expression started softening bit by bit.</p>
<p>– Will you really do anything?</p>
<p>– ...Uh, if it is something possible for me.</p>
<p>– Hmm...♪</p>
<p>Has it drawn her interest by some chance?<br />Tachibana started devilishly grinning and attentively looking me up and down.</p>
<p>-... Bookworm, you have a nice figure, huh? You're surprisingly tall.</p>
<p>– What? Figure?</p>
<p>– Money, do you have some with you?</p>
<p>– Ah, yes. Ah, I hope you can leave me some for travelling expenses.</p>
<p>– Why do you always think it is extortion!! Come on, what kind of a girl do you think I am?</p>
<p>Tachibana turned away with a <em>huff</em>, just like a girl who rapidly changes her facial expression.<br />We are now often together, and it troubles me that useless information like this keeps increasing in my head.</p>
<p>– Well then, keep me a company for all of today...</p>
<p>– Haa, just say if there is something a full body track suit guy can do. I still don't think I am useful for anything except carrying baggage.</p>
<p>– Fufu... On the contrary, this may actually be a good development.</p>
<p>I'm not sure how, but it seems my useless promise put her in a good mood.</p>
<p>However, and errand that requires money? It conveniently overlapped with absurd incidental income that came from my aunt. As one would expect it, I have a bad feeling about this.<br />Just as I thought of that, she softly grabbed my wrist.</p>
<p>– Ehehe... Come here.</p>
<p>– O, oi!</p>
<p>The place I'm being dragged into, it appears that it is a shopping mall.<br />As I thought passersby gazes are seriously painful. Just her appearance is quite enough to pull pedestrians' attention.</p>
<p>– Oi, let's walk with a small distance between us... It's probably embarrassing for you, that others consider you to be together with me.</p>
<p>– It's okay. All the embarrassment will be gone in a bit. So excited!</p>
<p>– Ah, come again?</p>
<p>– Also...</p>
<p>Tachibana smiled at me with a grin.</p>
<p>– Bookworm, you don't care what others think of you. Wasn't it like that?</p>
<p>– You still remember that. Such a thing...</p>
<p>Even at the best of times I haven't gone to have fun outside, yet... a potentially anxiety-ridden day started.</p>
