<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; First Date ④</h3>


<p>Although the two of us have spent many hours on choosing clothes, we were quickly finished with today's original goal.</p>
<p>And this is probably because after <em>that</em>, Tachibana hasn't said much.<br />Despite the fact that she always does strange things to me and we always have idle talk, study time included. Just what has happened?</p>
<p>In any case, just like that.<br />We were simply walking in silence.</p>
<p>Evening sun has just set, the road was obscure.<br />Thin cloud was spread under slightly red sky.</p>
<p>Getting off on the train station that I usually don't, walking down a road I normally don't, with a kind of girl that I certainly haven't talked to till recent times.</p>
<p>I was carrying the purchased ingredients to the Tachibana residence.<br />Holding fully packed bag with one hand, I was walking two, three steps behind her.</p>
<p>Today, I originally came out to serve as a baggage guy...</p>
<p>Naturally, I'm not having Tachibana carry anything.<br />I was strictly educated about such things by my vigorous psycho aunt, so no problems there.<br />Even I can read between the lines. Rather, not speaking and observing on a regular basis, I read between the lines too much, to the extent I feel unpleasant myself. The reason I glue myself onto the seat and do nothing but study is that I choose to ignore everything even if I do understand.</p>
<p>That's why even now, not as an exception, I'm trying to understand what is happening, but... This slightly heavy atmosphere is probably not my imagination.<br />Tachibana that has been guffawing not so long ago is now gone.<br />Since the situation with Okamura and until now, hasn't she been keeping silence?</p>
<p>Her long blonde hair was swaying several steps in front of me.<br />The way she walked, her heels made subtle <em>click clack</em> sounds.</p>
<p>Is she by some chance... angry?<br />It's not like I have made her angry.</p>
<p>I would've understand it if I was the angry one, but why is she the one troubled?</p>
<p>I have my own mixed feelings too.<br />I have already been hated several times, but there were probably no cases of someone worried about me.<br />Having someone outside of family worry about me makes me feel somewhat vexed, sorry and, strangely enough, just a little bit happy. There was a fuzzy and itchy feeling in my chest, and I did not understand what kind of face I should make.</p>
<p>What words should I have said.</p>
<p>Really, what should I say?<br />―― I don't mind that at all.<br />―― I say, it isn't something to be angry about.<br />―― Who cares what small fry like them say.<br />All of them are appropriate, but I cannot say even one of them.</p>
<p>I was always like that. That is why I was always a loner.<br />Even though I know what words to say. Yet, as long as it isn't a serious matter, I am never the one to strike up a conversation. As long as the other party doesn't say anything, the silence will continue. It is the same even with my little sister, what can be said about others?</p>
<p>Now that I think of it, isn't that exactly the reason why I never properly remember other people's names?<br />If I don't strike up a conversation, then I don't need to address them.</p>
<p>Therefore, in the end, I was still walking in silence.<br />But as long as I'm keeping silence, my heart feels suffocated.<br />Having a quiet way back home in the evening right after a fun day is too emo for me...</p>
<p>Eventually the sun has set, and it became so dark, that streetlights felt very bright.<br />Looking around, I was once again astonished by this truly unfamiliar neighborhood.<br />It was a splendid residential area with  a row of large mansions.</p>
<p>– Hey...</p>
<p>Seeing Tachibana stop, I too stood in place and answered "<em>Hm?</em>"</p>
<p>– You know, after all, I cannot accept it. Even if you will feel annoyed, I'm planning to do something about it. About how you are treated in class. It's not only Okamura from today, is it?</p>
<p>Heavy luggage was about to tear off my fingers of the left hand.<br />I wanted to walk further without answering, but Tachibana's angry face rooted my body to the road.</p>
<p>– ... Not really. Why do you care?</p>
<p>– Haa? If someone important to them was being bad-mouthed, anyone would hate it, right?</p>
<p>It was too sudden and I was obviously startled.<br />Important...? Me?<br />It hasn't been long since we started talking like this, you know?</p>
<p>There are probably several possible explanations.<br />Among them, there is an unthinkably wide in its range "<em>important</em>". It is especially understandable type of explanation for a sociable girl like her. All the more for a girl that is frequently a part of rumors concerning different men.<br />Well, even if I deduct it like that... Just like always, I turned away from her eyes and sullenly replied:</p>
<p>– Um... that. The disliked guy<a title="Meaning Okamura." href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-145"><sup>1</sup></a> certainly has a reason to do what he does. It's just that you are not aware of it.</p>
<p>– Surely so, but I really hate it that in spite of being able to say such words, you are not trying to reveal yourself to others. I didn't think that you are a person who builds invisible walls around yourself.</p>
<p>– That so... You're quite frank, huh...</p>
<p>– But... Even if you are like that, I know so many positive things about you. You're so good at taking care of others, you may act cold, but you are never angry and occasionally you slyly act lovestruck, also... when we first met, do you remember?</p>
<p>– What?</p>
<p>When we first met. Does she mean our first conversation in the library?<br />Honestly, I don't remember anything special that happened. First conversation probably has a special meaning, but compared to our recent exchanges, I can't say that it was something memorable.</p>
<p>– Hmm, so you don't remember. Well, maybe it wasn't a big deal for you.</p>
<p>– What are you talking about? Now I am curious.</p>
<p>Tachibana intentionally turned her face with a "<em>Humph!</em>".</p>
<p>Still... making a face like that, she is now in a good mood, right?</p>
<p>– Haa... Come on, let's go. How far is it? My fingers are hurt, you know.</p>
<p>– Ah, err... It's here...</p>
<p>– Hm?</p>
<p>Here, you mean <em>here</em>?</p>
<p>There was quite a mansion before my eyes.<br />I wouldn't call it a residence, but it has a splendid terrace on upper floor and a verdant garden at the entrance. There is also a long garage, that seemingly is big enough for three cars.</p>
<p>Seriously... This girl, just what is her social standing?<br />Is it one of those where you think she plays around till late, but actually there is a strict curfew?</p>
<p>– Ah, err... A pretty cool house, huh?</p>
<p>– Yaa! So shyyy!</p>
<p>Ooh, this girl, showing a rare red face.<br />I thought to get back at her for always making fun of me, but... Regretfully, today I'm tired. It was a difficult day for a gloomy guy. Even though it is a day off, I feel like I spent two weeks' worth of energy.</p>
<p>And yet... It wasn't so unpleasant...</p>
<p>– Should I bring it to the entrance? It's quite heavy, you know.</p>
<p>– It's okay... It's somewhat embarrassing. Thank you for today.</p>
<p>– From my perspective, it is <em>I'm sorry for today</em>. I was feeling guilty from the very start.</p>
<p>Handing over the bag, I started to walk as it was.<br />I thought it was a logical closure for today, yet... My sleeve got slightly pulled.</p>
<p>"<em>W-, What?</em>" I turned around.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, Tachibana had a shy look on her face,</p>
<p>– Um, er... I mean, today was really fun, even though you're a virgin, and some things were surprising, um... Thank you. Let's have some fun together again. About a hundred times.</p>
<p>– Are you planning to waste all my days off! Well, it was actually fun...</p>
<p>Grabbing my sleeve and poking me when I was just about to go home. Somehow, it feels the same as our usual parting time in library.<br />It was a bit funny, so I smiled a little.</p>
<p>Tachibana still hasn't released my sleeve. I already know what that means.</p>
<p>– ...Do you want to say something?</p>
<p>–  Let me see... Umm...</p>
<p>– We will meet at school on the day after tomorrow. You can tell me at that time.</p>
<p>– No, it has to be now. Look, here...</p>
<p>Having said that, she pulled out a small paper package form her bag.<br />I reflexively took what was handed over to me, but Tachibana was glaring at that package. Seems like I have to open it.<br />And inside was a</p>
<p>– Eh? Necklace?</p>
<p>– Yes, I bought it while you went to the restroom. With today's final outfit, your neck was a little lonely, that's why. I arranged it with monotone in mind, and your T-shirt is pure white.</p>
<p>Something resembling a golden ring is tied to a black string.<br />Huh? Isn't this...? Am I not just like Frodo with a hanging ring...</p>
<p>-Ah. Right now, you thought of something sad again, for sure! That face,</p>
<p>– It was not. It was better than usual. By the way, won't it be too flashy? It would be a little embarrassing to...</p>
<p>– It's okay, for you to wear that much. You'll get used to it, surely.</p>
<p>– And yeah, money. How much was it?</p>
<p>– Fufu, don't mind.</p>
<p>Then, Tachibana lifted the heavy plastic bag on her shoulder and went to the gate,</p>
<p>– Take it as thanks for teaching me every day! Well, see you on Monday!</p>
<p>– Ye-, yeah...</p>
<p>You've gone too far with your thanks, jeez.<br />And just when am I supposed to put it on?</p>
<p>That was the day's end. I went home in a good mood.<br />Well, maybe it isn't bad to do this from time to time... I thought like that.</p>
<p>――Important person, huh?</p>
<p>――Just how long will I be able to remain important?</p>
