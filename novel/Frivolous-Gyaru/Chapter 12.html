<h3>Chapter 12: Real or Fake</h3>


<p> <br />My basic daily cycle is decided.<br /> <br />In the morning I exercise, study, and then in the afternoon there’s a pretty high chance I’ll be attacked by Red and the others.<br /> <br />In between those times I watch movies and overseas dramas recommended by Reima and the other staff but…today was a bit different.<br /> <br />“Hey, Shirakawa.”<br /> <br />“Hm?”<br /> <br />“Why are you here?”<br /> <br />For some reason my attending doctor Shirakawa is here.<br /> <br />Sitting on the sofa a person’s space away from me in the solitary confinement cell, she gathers her white hair into a bundle behind her and tries to start up the player equipped in the cell.<br /> <br />“Because I’m bored of course.”<br /> <br />“Huh…”<br /> <br />“It’s obvious isn’t it? I don’t have anything I should be doing…everyone’s working during this time. I got bored and came.”<br /> <br />“Go home. You’ll get fired.”<br /> <br />“I can just say I was providing mental care for you if anything comes up. Come on, I properly brought snacks so it’s fine right?”<br /> <br />Don’t think you can bait me with snacks?<br /> <br />Plus there are already snacks thoughtfully gifted by the staff in this cell.<br /> <br />“But you’re loved huh.”<br /> <br />“Why’s that?”<br /> <br />Looking at something on a smartphone in her hand, Shirakawa talks to me cheerfully.<br /> <br />Loved?<br /> <br />“It’s an app called Tummutter. All their posts are just about you. See?”<br /> <br />On the smartphone screen she shows me is an image of Red transformed, with short text next to it.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“The Black Knight was energetic today too!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />…………<br /> <br />“Uh, what does this mean?”<br /> <br />“Well simply put, it’s letting the world know you’re alive and well.”<br /> <br />“What’s she doing!?”<br /> <br />I’m energetic sure, but there’s no need to broadcast pointless stuff like this!<br /> <br />“And this one’s Kirara’s.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“I was surprised when he taught me instead while I tried to teach him. I have to work hard too.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />I do remember teaching Yellow studying.<br /> <br />Well, this much is normal. Anyway she’s the most reassuring and helpful.<br /> <br />But the scariest is Blue.<br /> <br />“Wha-what’s Blue writing…!?”<br /> <br />I nervously look at the screen Shirakawa shows me.<br /> <br />In the column with transformed Blue’s picture, the text says…<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“The Black Knight was puppy-like today too. Cute.”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />…………<br /> <br />“She thinks I’m like a dog!?”<br /> <br />There are limits to rudeness…!!<br /> <br />And why’s the attached picture a dog too!?<br /> <br />“I don’t think she means it in a bad way. Kattun does have a puppy-like atmosphere like the picture. This is a Siberian Husky right?”<br /> <br />“I’ll interrogate her later…!!”<br /> <br />Calm down for now.<br /> <br />I can’t accept being treated like a dog but the attached dog photo is innocent.<br /> <br />Taking a deep breath and regaining my composure, I lightly sigh.<br /> <br />“It’s like an observational diary about me…”<br /> <br />“Well, it’s something the general public wants. In a way it’s providing a certain amount of information because of them, right?”<br /> <br />I don’t know what’s so interesting about learning about me.<br /> <br />“…Oh well.”<br /> <br />“Oh, is it okay?”<br /> <br />“Like you said, this seems like them providing information as the Justice Crusaders. If Reima recommended it, they have to follow it right? you don’t have to get that annoyed about it either.”<br /> <br />Though I do intend to complain about the dog treatment.<br /> <br />“…You’re dense huh. Well, it can’t be helped considering it’s you.”<br /> <br />But is this Tummutter thing really that fun?<br /> <br />I don’t even have a smartphone, and I know almost nothing about Tummutter.<br /> <br />“Rather than that, want to watch a movie or something? Since I know your daily cycle I came to play during this time.”<br /> <br />“Premeditated criminal…”<br /> <br />Sighing, I try choosing what to watch.<br /> <br />Yesterday I was given 3 movies by Reima and the staff.<br /> <br />“Action, sci-fi, romance. Which do you want?”<br /> <br />“Actually I don’t watch those kinds of movies.”<br /> <br />Same for me.<br /> <br />But that’s surprising. I figured Shirakawa had the type of personality to enjoy watching movies on days off.<br /> <br />“We can skip the romance. I don’t want the awkward atmosphere, and I don’t really understand romance anyway.”<br /> <br />“The staff strongly recommended it but…if you say so then it can’t be helped.”<br /> <br />“Could it be someone among the staff looks at Kattun with indecent eyes?”<br /> <br />“They’re people who kindly dealt with me causing so much trouble. There’s absolutely no way.”<br /> <br />“Hmm, I want to make that staff who recommended it feel guilty by having them hear that from you.”<br /> <br />They did seem a bit suspicious when they gave it to me but…<br /> <br />That was probably just because they weren’t used to talking to me since I was the Black Knight.<br /> <br />“We watched an action movie yesterday so how about sci-fi today?”<br /> <br />“Yeah. I don’t care as long as it kills time.”<br /> <br />Don’t say things so pointlessly.<br /> <br />Sighing at Shirakawa lightly saying something heartless, I play the disc she lent me.<br /> <br />“Then I’ll sit next to you.”<br /> <br />Shirakawa carrying drinks sits next to me on the sofa I’m on and watches the screen.<br /> <br />Without thinking anything particular, I focus on the movie about to start.<br /> <br />The sci-fi movie that played was more of a human drama with some action elements, a bit different than I imagined.<br /> <br />‘You’re not human.’<br /> <br />‘You’re a machine made of scrap and oil.’<br /> <br />‘You were never alive to begin with.’</p>







<p><br /> <br />It’s about an android who thinks it’s human despite being created by humans, and the protagonist who dislikes androids, as they confront the meaning of the android’s existence together.<br /> <br />Whether they’re human because they have a flesh body, or because they have a heart.<br /> <br />While harboring anguish and conflict about being a created life, it finds itself.<br /> <br />I gradually become absorbed in the story.<br /> <br />‘Then,’<br /> <br />‘I am human.’<br /> <br />‘Not because I was created as such.’<br /> <br />‘Because that’s what I wish to be.’<br /> <br />Whether it’s human or not.<br /> <br />The android, which initially tried to have its existence recognized by someone, accepts itself through the story, and still tries to exist as a human.<br /> <br />The protagonist who acted together with the android also acknowledges it as an equal friend, recognizing its way of being.<br /> <br />Feeling considerable satisfaction from developments that shake me and make all those frustrations seem trivial, I unconsciously look next to me at Shirakawa.<br /> <br />“…Shirakawa, are you crying?”<br /> <br />“Huh?”<br /> <br />Not realizing it herself, Shirakawa touches her wet cheeks.<br /> <br />“Oh, um, it was a better movie than I expected so I got emotional. Haha…”<br /> <br />“Are you okay?”<br /> <br />“Yeah…don’t worry about it.”<br /> <br />I probably shouldn’t pry too much.<br /> <br />I can be considerate that much at least.<br /> <br />“Hey, Kattun.”<br /> <br />“Hm?”<br /> <br />As the movie ends and the credits roll, Shirakawa suddenly calls out to me.<br /> <br />“If you were a fake, and your real self was someone else…what would Kattun think?”<br /> <br />“What’s with the sudden question?”<br /> <br />“It’s about the movie. If it’s human or not. If the fake thought it was the real thing…would it really become the real thing?”<br /> <br />If you take it that far it becomes a philosophical discussion right?<br /> <br />But well, Shirakawa doesn’t seem to want a professional response.<br /> <br />“It’s the same as the end of this movie. What’s important is yourself.”<br /> <br />“Yourself…?”<br /> <br />“There’s no need for the fake to become real. What matters is whether you can affirm yourself.”<br /> <br />If it could be twisted by what others say, that’s the end of it.<br /> <br />But…<br /> <br />“If you keep doubting your own existence, who’s gonna affirm you?”<br /> <br />First you have to affirm yourself.<br /> <br />At least that’s how I felt after watching this movie.<br /> <br />“What if the real Kattun existed, and the Kattun here now was fake…what would you think?”<br /> <br />“There’s no way the real me would think to replace my current position even if he existed.”<br /> <br />“Ha, ha, you’re right.”<br /> <br />No one would want my position.<br /> <br />Objectively even I don’t wanna do it, and if a fake me said something stupid like wanting to be me, I’d stop him with everything I’ve got.<br /> <br />“Hey. Could this be part of a mental check or something?”<br /> <br />“No, that’s not my intention. Just…”<br /> <br />Shirakawa stops there after saying that much.<br /> <br />As if hesitating over what to say, she looks conflicted, then faces me looking resolved.<br /> <br />“…I seem to have a sister.”<br /> <br />“That’s too sudden.”<br /> <br />It completely derails the conversation.<br /> <br />And what’s with ‘seem to’?<br /> <br />“More like a step-sister I guess. But…she was extremely excellent, this sister I hear.”<br /> <br />“You’re a doctor around our age, I think that’s impressive enough.”<br /> <br />“I’m fudging my age.”<br /> <br />“Huh?”<br /> <br />“Keep it secret okay?”<br /> <br />Saying that with a friendly smile, she puts her index finger to her lips.<br /> <br />Could it be she’s older than us despite this young appearance…?<br /> <br />“So compared to my sister who looks completely different than me, my abilities are degraded versions of degraded versions…<br /> <br />“So my parents were disappointed in me.”<br /> <br />“…Did you…rarely meet your sister face to face…?”<br /> <br />“…Hehe, I haven’t met her face to face since I was born. I still haven’t found her, and probably can never meet her face to face of my own accord, right?”<br /> <br />Your family situation is too complicated.<br /> <br />“That’s, how to say, uh…”<br /> <br />“Don’t worry about it. She doesn’t know about me either, and that’s for the best. Families come in various forms.”<br /> <br />“Yeah. You’re right.”<br /> <br />Come to think of it, I don’t know much about Shirakawa.<br /> <br />Despite being rude calling me Kattun right after we first met, I am indebted to her.<br /> <br />If I can at least be someone she can talk to…<br /> <br />“I’ve never met or even seen my sister’s face. I did want to meet her at one point but in the end, my wish didn’t come true.”<br /> <br />“It’d be good if you could meet.”<br /> <br />“You think so? If we met, I might not know what to do, you know?”<br /> <br />“You wouldn’t do anything like that.”<br /> <br />At my words, Shirakawa laughs for some reason.<br /> <br />She wasn’t ridiculing or anything. With tears in her eyes she laughed innocently.<br /> <br />“Ah, ahaha! Oh geez, why am I talking so much? Is it because of this movie? Ahaha, how strange…”<br /> <br />“Shirakawa…?”<br /> <br />Wiping the tears in her eyes, Shirakawa finishes laughing and goes limp against the sofa back.<br /> <br />“You know, I entered here around the same time you were captured.”<br /> <br />“Eh, really? I figured you had been here long before.”<br /> <br />“I’m a newer face than you’d think–me.”<br /> <br />But Red and the others seemed close with you.<br /> <br />Starting from our first meeting calling me by nickname, unlike me she must skillfully close the distance with people.<br /> <br />Then, the credits that were rolling end, and the screen fades to black.<br /> <br />“Looks like it’s over. …It was moving but also a slightly scary movie. It made me think about what’s right, the real or the fake.”<br /> <br />“Are you going back?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I rested too much. I’ll go back before getting scolded.”<br /> <br />Standing up, Shirakawa heads to the door.<br /> <br />“To be honest, when I entered here I wondered what would happen. I didn’t even have a purpose to live for.”<br /> <br />“Shirakawa…”<br /> <br />“Don’t make that face, Kattun. You know, I like you. The same as the kids you’re with.”<br /> <br />The kids? She means Red and the others? Sounds meaningful.<br /> <br />I unconsciously tilt my head, and still smiling, Shirakawa leaves the solitary cell.<br /> <br />“Affirming yourself huh.”<br /> <br />I murmur the words I said to Shirakawa.<br /> <br />Various things have happened since I came here.<br /> <br />“It’s probably about time I move forward too.”<br /> <br />Not becoming a member of the Justice Crusaders.<br /> <br />Just that maybe I can open my heart a little to those nosy people.<br /> <br />“I’ll try submitting an outing request.”<br /> <br />I’ll probably get annoying reactions but it’s more than enough as a first step.</p>

<p>[Chat] Thread about Black Knight-kun 3<br />■TOP■ ALL 1 &lt;&lt;100 100&gt;&gt; NEW 50<br /> </p>



<p> <br />801: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />We always talk about Black Knight-kun, so let’s discuss Justice Crusader for once.<br /> <br />802: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Then how about that high impact scene of Black Knight-kun going “Boom! Haa!! Justice Crusader! Why aren’t you fighting?!” That miraculous near-miss line was great right?<br /> <br />803: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Don’t forget that time when Black Knight-kun saw Justice Crusader’s posing for the first time and went “Huh, what, you guys aren’t embarrassed by that…?” giving them a frank reaction.<br /> <br />804: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I like the episode where he watched Red and the others fight from the rear as additional fighters. Considering his personality now, I can imagine he was worriedly watching over them.<br /> <br />805: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />There was some bashing at the time. They were called a cosplay group just riding on Black Knight-kun’s popularity. Well it’s understandable since their suits resembled Black Knight-kun’s.<br /> <br />806: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Actually, Justice Crusader’s suits are the next-gen version of Black Knight-kun’s suit. The power is split between 3 people to reduce risks and make it operable.<br /> <br />807: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I was surprised they were all girls.<br /> <br />808: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />They really grabbed attention. And in actual activity they’re stupid strong, able to defeat monsters normally.<br /> <br />809: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Same as now, they’re excellent advertising towers. But I did think it’s a shame they don’t reveal the girls inside.<br /> <br />810: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It’d be real bad if their identities got exposed. I know people fantasize they’re idols or celebrities, but the Justice Crusaders risking their lives to protect us are heroes.<br /> <br />811: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Well they did appear in CMs. It was probably to raise awareness, but still.<br /> <br />812: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Even if their identities did get exposed, their combat ability without the suits is probably high too. Otherwise they couldn’t be heroes.<br /> <br />813: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Modern swordmaster Red. Powerful brawler Yellow. Precise machinist Blue. It’s funny those are their cute nicknames.<br /> <br />814: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Those aren’t nicknames you’d give to girls lol<br /> <br />815: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Remember that doll monster who could turn humans into stuffed animals? When it turned a family into dolls, Red become really furious even the monster’s minions were sliced to bits despite Red being halfway dollified herself.<br />Because of that she got called Berserker Red and gained popularity in those circles, but…<br /> <br />816: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Red: “…” <em>Slice slice slice!!</em><br />Doll Monster: “…” Nearly dead<br /> <br />817: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Despite being a doll monster, it bled, dyeing Red’s suit red.<br /> <br />818: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Scary, but that rage was natural. That doll monster primarily targeted kindergartens and elementary schools. Leaving nothing but mangled dolls, it was infuriating…<br /> <br />819: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Honestly, I think she did the right thing. That doll monster had an infuriating attitude, deliberately provoking people.<br /> <br />820: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />She’s usually so kind but…<br />Her basic tactic being bisecting does make her scary.<br /> <br />821: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I think the monster side is clearly the problem, as usual.<br /> <br />822: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Yellow had her moments too.<br />Like with the light eating monster Glitter.<br /> <br />823: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Oh right, when Japan went completely dark. I thought it was really the end.<br /> <br />824: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />That guy was an idiot.<br />He first approached Black Knight-kun claiming to be an additional hero.<br /> <br />825: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Lol<br /> <br />826: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Was he a fool?<br /> <br />827: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />If it was a mistake, that’s just terrible luck… lol<br /> <br />828: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Of all things, approaching the planet killer Black Knight-kun. What an idiot.<br /> <br />829: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />As expected, after getting beaten up by Black Knight-kun, Glitter more wisely approached Red and the others instead. And in the guise of a handsome human at that.<br /> <br />830: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Unforgivable.<br /> <br />831: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />As usual, Red and co. who only show intimate reactions to Black Knight-kun saw through him, but before Glitter could show his true colors, they inflicted critical near-fatal injuries at full power… The problem came after.<br /> <br />832: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Who could imagine Japan’s daylight disappearing. That light eating monster Glitter was the worst.<br /> <br />833: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />On top of that, he stole Yellow’s eyesight along with the light seen through her mask.<br /> <br />834: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />What, seriously!? It was pitch black so I didn’t realize that happened to her!<br /> <br />835: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It was a terrible incident…<br /> <br />836: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Glitter had the ability to detect opponents through means other than vision, so robbing them of light gave him an advantage against any enemy.<br />After stealing Yellow’s eyesight, the cocky Glitter, seeming to hold a grudge over being reduced to near-death before, declared he would kill Yellow’s family. Something in Yellow snapped.<br />The next moment, Glitter’s head was separated far from his body.<br /> <br />837: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Huh?<br /> <br />838: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Yellow: “Oraaa! Where are ya, come out ya bastard! I can’t fuckin’ see!!” <em>Bam bam bam</em><br />Glitter: “…” Nearly dead<br /> <br />839: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Despite calling himself an executive monster, Glitter died easily, but it was good the light returned after that.<br /> <br />840: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Even Yellow who was treated as a tank up till then became a magnificent power gorilla.<br />Or should I say, chivalrous Yellow.<br /> <br />841: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />When Yellow snaps, her surroundings disappear.<br /> <br />842: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Guess I should bring up Blue’s case too.<br /> <br />843: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Blue had an incident?<br /> <br />844: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />About the equality monster Barasan.<br /> <br />845: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The one who could trap people in an area and equalize everyone’s power right?<br />Where Red and Yellow got separated, and Blue got trapped in a shopping mall with civilians.<br />Could you be a victim?<br /> <br />846: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Um, are you sure it’s okay to talk about this when the people involved adamantly don’t…?<br /> <br />847: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I was there.<br /> <br />I went shopping at the mall and got caught up in the ability near Blue. I was surprised when my body suddenly felt heavy, but I heard it averages out powers including babies and children, so it was a seriously dangerous monster. Barasan was unaffected.<br /> <br />848: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />A wretched monster as expected. I know Blue won, but how?<br /> <br />849: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Even in transformed state, Blue was still affected by the power, so she calmly gathered materials from the hardware store and built an intensely lethal rainbow-colored trap.<br /> <br />850: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Huh?<br /> <br />851: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Seriously?<br /> <br />852: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />She made a vicious trap with help from the trapped people, lured Barasan in through the broadcast, provoked and guided him into the traps one after another until he was incapacitated, then finished him off with an energy shot once the power dispelled.<br /> <br />853: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />A… a workshop girl..? (Trembling voice)<br /> <br />854: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Why is a high school girl catching monsters with trap tactics…?<br /> <br />855: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />At the time, I asked in bewilderment:<br /> <br />Q: How can you make things like this?<br /> <br />Blue: “I saw it in a family movie.”<br /> <br />Barasan: “…” (Nearly dead)<br /> <br />856: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The definition of family movie is broken.<br /> <br />857: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />But not casually saying horror movie means she’s kind of serious lol<br /> <br />858: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Just what kind of movies do you watch, Blue?<br /> <br />859: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The more I learn, the more alike she seems to Black Knight-kun.<br /> <br />860: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Looks like the monster side tried to avoid 3-on-1 as much as possible. It’s quite disadvantageous apparently.<br /> <br />861: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />They went as far as preparing monsters to split them up.<br /> <br />862: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Some monsters did actually call 3-on-1 unfair.<br /> <br />863: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />In Justice Crusader’s case, the power is split 3 ways so they should be at a disadvantage output-wise.<br /> <br />864: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Meanwhile, Black Knight-kun was literally slaughtering monsters at full spec.<br /> <br />865: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />No comparing that to a guy wielding a single undivided power at full specs lol<br /> <br />866: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />With the saint suspicions about Black Knight-kun’s identity coming out, I’m too interested in what’ll happen to him.<br /> <br />867: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It’s not suspicions.<br /> <br />868: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He’s fighting for freedom and peace after all.<br /> <br />869: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Protosuit: “Yes, together with me~”<br /> <br />870: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Nooo, Protosuit-chan!?<br /> <br />871: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Protosuit-chan anthropomorphized and illustrated just days after the announcement!?<br /> <br />872: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Hurry up and get equipped by Black Knight-kun!<br /> <br />873: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Apparently it literally drains the life out of anyone else who tries equipping it.<br /> <br />874: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It’s obedient to Black Knight-kun huh.<br /> <br />875: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It’s awful how rapidly the illustrations spread.<br /> <br />876: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Everyone seeks the same thing huh.<br /> <br />877: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Justice Crusader’s webmaster has fun reactions.<br />They’re apparently the commander and development lead, an amazing person.<br /> <br />878: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Answers to 2 years of questions came out, yet the aftermath is awful. Never dreamed Black Knight-kun’s suit would get anthropomorphized too.</p>






<p>879: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />&gt;&gt;877<br />I get it.<br />The writing is amusing.<br />Has an unidentified joke character feeling.</p>
<p>880: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Never imagined Red and the others’ profiles would get published back then.</p>
<p>881: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The webmaster’s a fashion space alien.</p>
<p>882: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It’s funny how genius and fool are called two sides of the same coin when it comes to anthropomorphizing.</p>
<p>883: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />And they get along well with Black Knight-kun.<br />Well enough to share movies.</p>
<p>884: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Never heard episodes of Red and co. getting jealous lol</p>
<p>885: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />That time the only obvious one was Red’s phrasing becoming yandere-like.</p>
<p>886: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Quoting Red’s disturbing document:</p>
<p>Why, just why?<br />Black Knight-kun,<br />Why do you call the commander by name but not call me by my name?</p>
<p>887: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Not just the suit, she’s overcome by the commander too, poor thing.</p>
<p>888: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Poor thing is cute.</p>
<p>889: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun seems to have the sentiment of not wanting to address his rival by name.</p>
<p>890: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Like a wary big dog that doesn’t get overly friendly.</p>
<p>Cute.</p>
<p>891: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Since Blue straight up compared him to a Siberian Husky, it’s even more so.</p>
<p>892: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />However they get along, it’s harmonious.</p>
<p>893: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Justice Crusader had nonstop battles too, so I want them to live normal lives.</p>
<p>894: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />They’ve probably defeated all the monsters already, so no need to worry. (Flag)</p>
<p>895: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I hope they’ll show Black Knight-kun’s everyday life sometime.<br />In suit is fine too.</p>
<p>896: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun Vtuber debut!?</p>
<p>897: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />That would cause mayhem in many areas…</p>
<p>898: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />There’s the official PR rep Nao Aobana, so there’s a chance!</p>
