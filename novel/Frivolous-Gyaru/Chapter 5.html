<h3>Chapter 5: The Nightmare He Saw</h3>

<p>It’s the dream I always see.</p>



<p> <br /><strong>[Early this morning, a passenger plane crashed at XXX.]</strong><br /> <br />In a cramped, dark space filled with debris, I was alive.<br /> <br />The smell stung my nose.<br /> <br />The only thing connecting me to life was the rainwater dripping down from above.<br /> </p>



<p> <br /><strong>[Rescue efforts begin, an attempt is made to search for survivors.]</strong><br /> <br />They’re watching me.<br /> <br />Two lifeless gazes.<br /> <br />Even the kind expression and eyes I knew transformed into ones filled with agony as they continued watching me.<br /> <br />I couldn’t look away.<br /> <br />Because my body was pinned under debris, I could barely move.<br /> </p>



<p> <br /><strong>[Many dead, finding survivors seems hopeless.]</strong><br /> <br />It’s agonizing.<br /> <br />Please stop.<br /> <br />I’m finally freed from this hell.<br /> </p>



<p> <br /><strong>[Three days after the crash! A seven year old child rescued from the wreckage!]</strong><br /> <br />I alone somehow survived.<br /> <br />Everyone important to me was gone.<br /> </p>



<p> <br /><strong>[Miracle child, dramatic rescue from the brink of death!]</strong><br /> <br />“Katsumi! Tell us about the situation back then!!”<br /> <br />Stop it.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Just what happened there!? Katsumi!!”<br /> <br />Leave me alone.<br /> </p>



<p>“Say something, anything, don’t stay silent!”<br /> <br />I hate television.<br /> </p>



<p>“Won’t you say a word about your deceased family!?”<br /> <br />I don’t want to interact with anyone anymore.<br /> </p>



<p>“Why won’t you answer!? We have a duty to convey the truth!!”<br /> </p>



<p>I wonder why I’m still alive.<br /> <br />“It’s okay. You’re okay…”<br /> <br />The moment I faintly heard someone’s clear voice, the black silhouettes that had surrounded and flung unintelligible words at me disappeared.<br /> <br />Next I felt a sensation like someone was embracing me.<br /> <br />As my consciousness surfaced and I opened my eyes with a sluggish feeling, there was an unpleasantly perfect face right in front of me.<br /> <br />“Oh, you’re awake? Are you okay?”<br /> <br />“Red…?”<br /> <br />“Yeah.”<br /> <br />Did I fall asleep?<br /> <br />So I had the usual nightmare, was fretting when Red embraced me as I awoke?<br /> <br />Having understood the whole situation, I calmly stand up and dash into the bathroom, closing the door.<br /> <br />“Oh, is he embarrassed?”<br /> <br />I can hear her carefree voice but with an anguished expression I immediately kneel in that spot and…<br /> <br />“Bluueehhhh!”<br /> <br />“Ehhhhhh!?”<br /> <br />I vomit up what was welling up in my chest.<br /> <br />After going to the refrigerator and drinking water to wet my mouth, I notice Red and the others looking at me dumbfounded.<br /> <br />…That was bad of me.<br /> <br />No matter what, that just now was inexcusable.<br /> <br />“Sorry. Don’t worry about it, it’s not your fault.”<br /> <br />“No I do worry! My heart is in pieces! I didn’t think you’d puke! It was a beauty’s embrace!”<br /> <br />“Saying that yourself is normal huh.”<br /> <br />Some serious confidence, but it is factual.<br /> <br />Well, when I was going to school normally I was pretty popular so there’s no mistake.<br /> <br />Though it doesn’t get through to me.<br /> <br />“Honestly I did think it was lame.”<br /> <br />“Yeah.”<br /> <br />Yellow and Blue who had been watching in the same room are saying some awful things.<br /> <br />Red purses her lips and looks at them with a squint.<br /> <br />“You guys are allies…right?”<br /> <br />“We can become your greatest enemies depending on circumstances.”<br /> <br />“Don’t get cocky, Red. Don’t think you can stay the leader forever.”<br /> <br />“Friendship collapse!?”<br /> <br />Red is dejected after being glared at by Yellow and Blue.<br /> <br />I don’t even have the energy to retort to the fact they’ve completely made themselves at home in the room.</p>

<p><br /> <br />Noticing the three are doing something around a table while directing chaotic gazes at me, I let out a sigh of resignation and sit in one of the five chairs.<br /> <br />“So what are you doing?”<br /> <br />“Um, a quiz tournament.”<br /> <br />“What are you really doing?”<br /> <br />Isn’t it nothing you’d do in my confinement room?<br /> <br />Though for a quiz tournament, all that’s on the table is a laptop.<br /> <br />“Where are the questions?”<br /> <br />“Well, we thought we’d have a voice program read them out.”<br /> <br />“Unnecessarily talented…”<br /> <br />“I’m in science after all.”<br /> <br />Right, enough to disarm my bombs.<br /> <br />Whether that’s the power of science I don’t know.<br /> <br />“Hey, want to join the quiz Katsumi?”<br /> <br />“Huh? No way. I don’t intend to get all buddy-buddy with you guys.”<br /> <br />They try to recruit me into the Justice Crusaders periodically but I absolutely won’t join.<br /> <br />No matter what the world says, only I, only I, absolutely won’t join them.<br /> <br />“Could it be you’re scared of losing?”<br /> <br />“Ha? What’d you just say? No way I’m scared.”<br /> <br />“Oh, shy huh…I mean avoiding quizzes to that extent means you’re bad at them, right?”<br /> <br />Yellow speaks in a provoking tone.<br /> <br />Me, afraid to lose at a mere quiz?<br /> <br />“Fine, let’s do it! If I lose, I’ll listen to anything you say except joining as an additional warrior!!”<br /> <br />“Then if we lose, we’ll treat you to a meal.”<br /> <br />“I’ll have you treat me to a crazy expensive one…!”<br /> <br />Since I’ve never had delivery food, I’m looking forward to it…!!<br /> <br />“Wait a bit more, I’m making the questions now.”<br /> <br />One way or another I accepted but it looks like it will still take some time for the questions to be ready.<br /> <br />Blue says she’s making questions on the computer. The answerers are me, Red, and Yellow, three people.<br /> <br />I cross my arms and try to wage psychological warfare, speaking to the two.<br /> <br />“Regret instigating this battle…! I’m the guy who beat the Quiz Monster, you know…!!”<br /> <br />“Eh, what’s with that weak sounding monster? Was it strong?”<br /> <br />As the name suggests, it was a monster that gave quizzes.<br /> <br />The nasty thing about it was it would forcibly make all humans within a certain range participate as answerers.<br /> <br />Get a question wrong and it would impose an inescapable penalty on everyone.<br /> <br />“How did you beat it?”<br /> <br />“I chucked a rock from super long range and smashed its question mark head.”<br /> <br />“Can that be called winning the quiz…?”<br /> <br />I tried facing it head on once but within range you can’t attack unless you answer the quizzes right, and even if you do get it right you can’t deal much damage.<br /> <br />“Then how did you defeat the ghost monster?”<br /> <br />“You guys somehow already know the contents of the questionnaire right?”<br /> <br />What about confidentiality…?<br /> <br />“Well, it said to only show Shirakawa-chan but didn’t say Shirakawa-chan couldn’t talk about it.”<br /> <br />“No, there’s things like a doctor’s confidentiality right? Don’t make it sound like I did something wrong…”<br /> <br />That’s weird on a common sense level right?<br /> <br />…………<br /> <br />Why do I have to lecture them on common sense…?<br /> <br />“Well well, tell us. To be honest, because of your questionnaire the higher ups have way more than headaches.”<br /> <br />“Haah, it can’t be helped. I also don’t want to be asked the same questions again…”<br /> <br />I let out a sigh and explain about the ghost monster.<br /> <br />“The ghost monster couldn’t be affected by physical attacks but in exchange, it also couldn’t attack opponents.”<br /> <br />“I see, sounds like a pretty easy opponent.”<br /> <br />“In exchange, it would psychologically attack like Japanese horror.”<br /> <br />Red’s face instantly turns blue, despite being red.<br /> <br />To be honest, I don’t have a very good impression of this monster.<br /> <br />But for their sake. If I hide it clumsily they’ll catch on right away and annoyingly worry, so I’ll tell it straight.<br /> <br />“It would peek into the mind of its opponent and take the form of someone dear to them that passed away.”<br /> <br />“…It has a really nasty personality huh.”<br /> <br />“That was its ability.”<br /> <br />It doesn’t actually possess them but it’s like invoking a spirit.<br /> <br />Imitating perfectly their emotions, personality, habits, it psychologically pressures the opponent and takes their weakened soul as power.<br /> <br />“Well, it didn’t work on me but…”<br /> <br />“Eh, but at the time for you it was probably…”<br /> <br />“Yeah, my family.”<br /> <br />“””….!”””<br /> <br />So you see, I didn’t tell this story to make you guys make those faces.</p>

<p>Feeling I did something bad, I hurriedly continue speaking.<br /> <br />“Anyway. Stuff like resentful words on that level didn’t work on me.”<br /> <br />“I-I see…”<br /> <br />While in its monster form it was invincible to any kind of attack, by taking human form it seems to gain a physical body.<br /> <br />“When the ghost monster took the form of a dead person it had a physical body. I easily beat it down like that and defeated it.”<br /> <br />“I’m glad I didn’t have to fight it since I’m scared of ghosts…”<br /> <br />“Uh huh.” …Put horror movies on the item wishlist next time. Let’s see if we can drive Red and Yellow away by playing them loudly.<br /> <br />“What about the Smile Monster? That one caused quite major damage right?”<br /> <br />“I know about it too. All of a sudden tons of people started laughing for no reason, and lots of traffic accidents happened, to the point it caused the function of the city center to halt, right?”<br /> <br />It had caused that much chaos huh. Well, considering its ability it’s not surprising.<br /> <br />“The Smile Monster’s ability was simple. Anyone it touched would be forcibly reminded of the happiest moment in their life, and unable to contain their joy, they would start laughing.”<br /> <br />“Huh, just the ability sounds pretty kind.”<br /> <br />“It would’ve been fine if that was all, but the troublesome part was the effect would spread from the people it touched too.”<br /> <br />The one to quickly realize how bad that was, was Blue. Raising her face from the computer she turns pale.<br /> <br />“That means…it spreads just from bumping shoulders and stuff out on the streets right?”<br /> <br />“Exactly. That’s why the damage spread so widely.”<br /> <br />What comes to mind is the image of the monster in a clown appearance smiling as it walks around. As it lightly brushes the shoulders of passing people, increasing the smiles, it had an incomprehensible creepiness like something from a poorly made horror movie.<br /> <br />“The effect probably lasts as long as the Smile Monster is alive. During that time, no matter what you do the laughter won’t stop.”<br /> <br />“S-scary…”<br /> <br />“It wouldn’t be a monster otherwise right?”<br /> <br />Making people smile, if only that was all it did. People made to laugh are deprived of emotions other than joy, even becoming unable to speak.<br /> <br />“How did you defeat the Smile Monster?”<br /> <br />“….Well, I just finished it off before it could touch me. Its combat strength itself wasn’t that much. You guys could beat it easily too.”<br /> <br />Simply that I didn’t laugh even when touched.<br /> <br />They’re all nothing but troublesome guys.<br /> <br />Though for me the electric slug monster was the most annoying.<br /> <br />“It’s done.”<br /> <br />While we were talking about the monsters, it seems the quiz was completed.<br /> <br />Operating the computer and looking at me, Blue sends her gaze to Red and Yellow before looking back to me.<br /> <br />“The rules are simple. When you know the answer to the asked question, answer aloud.”<br /> <br />“Got it.”<br /> <br />“Answer clearly, with conviction.”<br /> <br />“Why…?”<br /> <br />“Because otherwise it won’t get across.”<br /> <br />Huh, you’re the one operating it, it’s not like the computer decides right and wrong answers right?<br /> <br />While tilting my head at Blue’s meaningful confirmation, the quiz begins.<br /> <br />“We will now start the thrilling Justice Crusaders quiz tournament.”<br /> <br />“Unnecessarily stylized…”<br /> <br />Having the computer speak is amazing… Seeing stuff like this that I didn’t have until coming here makes me understand the progress of the times.<br /> <br />“It can also do this.”<br /> <br />“Lady Aoi banzai. Lady Aoi is the true leader of the Justice Crusaders.”<br /> <br />“Hey? You’re still aiming for the leader spot right!?”<br /> <br />Ignoring the tsukkomi from Red, Blue continues operating the computer.<br /> <br />Then once again, a voice flows from the computer.<br /> <br />“Confirming the conditions. If Lady Akane and Lady Kirara win, they gain authority to command Sir Katsumi. If Sir Katsumi wins, the losers gain the obligation to treat him to a meal, or make it. When the answer to the asked quiz is understood, inform Master Aoi verbally and a correct answer will be 1 point. Are these acceptable?”<br /> <br />No objections.<br /> <br />I feel like the condition of making food was added to the treating somehow but it’s not something to fuss over.<br /> <br />“Then, let us begin the quiz. Question 1.”<br /> <br />“Alright, I’ll do my best!”<br /> <br />“Do ya best!”<br /> <br />This is a battle against the Justice Crusaders too.<br /> <br />I’ll show them who’s the smartest…!!<br /> <br />“The surname of Justice Crusaders’ Red is Shinzo. Now, what is her first name?”<br /> <br />…………<br /> <br />“Um, hang on a sec?”<br /> <br />My mind blanked for a moment, huh, what? Why is it a question with an obvious answer for these guys?<br /> <br />Looking at Red beside me who seems similarly perplexed, she holds her head with a pained expression.<br /> <br />“What a difficult question…! What on earth is Red’s real name!?”<br /> <br />“It’s your name isn’t it!? Hey, why are you pretending not to know!? This is as shameless as it gets!!”<br /> <br />Sudden memory loss!? Red who seems to be struggling obviously forced, acts even more exaggeratedly surprised when she sees my reaction.</p>

<p><br /> <br />“Huh!? Could it be Katsumi knows the answer!? Go ahead and say it!”<br /> <br />“Waa, amazing. As expected of the man who beat the Quiz Monster. You’re even more impressive now.”<br /> <br />“Being able to understand this serious question already, indeed you’re the Black Knight. You’ve got it.”<br /> <br />As if acting in concert, Yellow and Blue begin moving.<br /> <br />Here I realize I’ve been had.<br /> <br />“O-oi, y-you guys, d-don’t tell me from the s-start-“<br /> <br />“What do you mean? Oh, there’s 3 questions total. You might be able to get them all right.”<br /> <br />Three!? From the flow I have to call out their first names don’t I!?<br /> <br />“Th-this match is invalid!! I quit!!”<br /> <br />I try to stand up from the chair but Red and Yellow sitting on either side hold down my shoulders.<br /> <br />I can’t stand up against the strength and intensity unimaginable from their usual selves.<br /> <br />“You said it didn’t you, that if you lost you’d listen to anything we say.”<br /> <br />“And after spoutin’ off so cocky, no way you’d quit now…right?”<br /> <br />“Giving up during the match means you lose at that point.”<br /> <br />Aren’t they scary…? They act more cunning than the monsters.<br /> <br />“I never said I’d listen to what you say! Th-there’s no proof of that anywhere!”<br /> <br />Since it’s come to this I’ll trample the conditions out of spite and escape!<br /> <br />There’s no way they’d take footage with security cameras in a situation like this, if I keep resisting here they’ll surely give up!!<br /> <br />“Fine, let’s do it!! If I lose, I’ll listen to anything you say except becoming an additional warrior!!”<br /> <br />And here a voice that seems to be mine rings out from the computer Blue is operating.<br /> <br />Th-that’s what I said in the spur of the moment when provoked by Yellow earlier…<br /> <br />“You guys call yourselves heroes!? …Haah!?”<br /> <br />Come to think of it, whether I win or lose it’s all gains for them! The Justice Crusaders are risking their lives with their work, they must get paid a lot.<br /> <br />For people like that, paying for delivery and the like is surely a trifle.<br /> <br />Compare that to me.<br /> <br />To win, I have to call them by their first names.<br /> <br />If I lose, I have to listen to anything they say except joining Justice Crusaders.<br /> <br />No matter which I choose, it’s hell…in that case…<br /> <br />“The answer is…Akane!”<br /> <br />I have no choice but to take the less risky winning side.<br /> <br />After saying it aloud, I’m tormented by the sensation that something large inside me was shaved away.<br /> <br />I’ve avoided getting familiar with them and calling them by name until now but for them to use a hand like this…unbelievable…!!<br /> <br />“Correct. Well done.”<br /> <br />I clench my teeth enduring Blue’s voice announcing the right answer.<br /> <br />I want to smash this computer right now and turn it to junk but it’s probably expensive so I’ll refrain…endure…!<br /> <br />Red next to me seems stunned for a while after hearing me call her name, then suddenly flushes red.<br /> <br />“U-um, ah, no, somehow hearing you actually call me makes my heart go thump thump! Ehehe…I-I’d rather stay as Red. It’s embarrassing.”<br /> <br />“I’ll seriously knock you down!?”<br /> <br />There’s no way you’d react like that now!?<br /> <br />Red holds both cheeks, blushing.<br /> <br />As I try to vent my anger while feeling the heat in my face, Yellow beside me places a hand on my shoulder first.<br /> <br />“Now then.”<br /> <br />“Let’s do the next question.”<br /> <br />“Question 2.”<br /> <br />“Ugh…”<br /> <br />The quiz is far from over.<br /> <br />Seeing two questions still remain on the computer screen, I make an expression of despair.</p>
