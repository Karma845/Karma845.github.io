<h3>Chapter 30 &#8211; UNO Tournament</h3>

<p>So, was that thing called overnight cramming meeting a real study meeting?<br />Like the one we have with Tachibana every day after school?</p>
<p>No kidding. These guys didn't have a speck of "<em>Let's do our best at least right before the tests</em>" spirit.</p>
<p>With more than 20 people gathered in the spacious and neat living room of Tachibana residence, it was an absolute chaos.<br />Saturday afternoon did turn into a home party with pizza ordered, but when it came to choosing what a class full of people with scattered hobbies should do now that they gathered, this was the result...</p>
<p>– ...Yeah, draw 4</p>
<p>– Aaaaa!</p>
<p>An UNO tournament was commenced in the room.<br />Rather, this house is huge!<br />Ceiling of the living room is high and southern side is entirely built of glass, quite a modern construction. Perhaps, it is a fair match to Honekawa<a title="&lt;a href=&quot;http://doraemon.wikia.com/wiki/Suneo_Honekawa&quot;&gt;This one&#8217;s&lt;/a&gt; family" href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-232"><sup>1</sup></a> residence, Kazama<a title="&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.fightersgeneration.com/nf2/game/tekken-mobile/jin-kazama-tekken-mobile-2017-render.jpg&quot;&gt;Kazama Clan&lt;/a&gt;" href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-232"><sup>2</sup></a> residence or even Malfoy residence, isn't it not?</p>
<p>By the way, what we are doing right now is UNO Tournament qualifiers, and we are scattered in small groups throughout the room. Seems like this was planned by Tachibana and her gang beforehand, that is to say there was probably no intention to study from the start. I want to quickly go home foy some real studies...</p>
<p>– As expected, Ichijou... You're still bearing a grudge, for this and that.</p>
<p>And that Nakamura, has just received a draw 4 from me and pouted as if frustrated.</p>
<p>However... This guy had always been talking louder in the classroom, but maybe he still feels guilty as impression he gives is a bit downhearted. And I don't like that. It's not like I want to get along with him, but I want to completely cut off all troublesome feelings on this occasion.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the rest of the group started laughing. The room was considerably lively.<br />Taking advantage of the noise, I jokingly replied.</p>
<p>– Who knows. Even if I bear a grudge, it has a size of one round of UNO.</p>
<p>– Haha, what's that. I don't get it.</p>
<p>– That is to say, we're even with that draw 4.</p>
<p>Hearing that, Nakamura faintly smiled.<br />After this, classmates in the vicinity who have seen our exchange yesterday, smiled as if feeling relieved.</p>
<p>The problem, however, is that our qualifiers group consists only of boys.<br />Just as the atmosphere around us has more or less calmed after the chat right now, the topic of our conversation went in a strange direction.</p>
<p>– You guys... Who, is your target?</p>
<p>One of the guys nearby suddenly asked this.<br />He looked towards a group of girls and for some reason grinned. Is he trying to say <em>let's commence an evaluation</em>?</p>
<p>Uhee...<br />It may be common, but this kind of topic is outside my area of expertise. That's what my loner's heart wants to cry out. Even now when it is doubtful if I am still a loner, my contents won't change so rapidly. Looking over, isn't Mr. Komatsu making a wry smile? I say, a guy who doesn't even hope to have friends can have neither a target, nor anything.</p>
<p>However, virgin brothers toughened by the unity of blood triumphantly began to speak.<br />As if the reason why they came here today, is to become acquainted with the girls.</p>
<p>– Actually, I... have once come to ask class head a question that I already understood the solution for. The feeling when she gently teaches you is irresistible.</p>
<p>– Hyoudou-san is also so beautiful. She gives a feeling of ennui and style.</p>
<p>– I mean, in this class, isn't girls' level unexpectedly high!? Others are...</p>
<p>Virgin B, who started reciting girls' names one after the other.<br />This guys can perfectly say all of this without getting embarrassed.</p>
<p>– Having said that... What about Tachibana-san?</p>
<p>When that name came out, my body stiffened by itself.<br />At the same time, I met eyes with Tachibana sitting in the distance... who lightly shook her hand my way and showed her usual bright smile. My heart is beating so fast, like it's about to jump out of my chest. Although it is not me speaking, but I'm worried that she will overhear and feel disgusted.</p>
<p>– Eeh, but that girl has a boyfriend, for sure. She's a bit too beautiful.</p>
<p>– Rather, this house is huge! She comes from a wealthy family and has such a flashy appearance...? Right now, aren't her parents here?</p>
<p>– The only rumors I hear about her are in regard to males... It seems number of people she experienced is unbelievable.</p>
<p>My heart skipped a beat. What is really true?<br />That girl who is so pure? Or, exactly because she is so pure...?</p>
<p>Still, she is free to do what she wants. It's not something I have to worry about. Noticing that I do mind after all, somehow, I felt a little frustrated. Now that she became the subject of the conversation, I am all the more aware of it. If I lift my head, I will certainly meet eyes with Tachibana again.</p>
<p>– So, Ichijou. Who's your type?</p>
<p>Ugh... This question is outside my area of expertise as well.<br />A guy who normally believes that there are no chances of having a member of the opposite sex to like him would not ponder such a question in the first place. I gave up in the very beginning. It's been so long ago, that I started doubting if there even was such a wish in that very beginning.</p>
<p>Girlfriend... is it? Even now, when I changed so much, what would happen if I did get one?</p>
<p>Still, type? I can only say that if I come to like someone, then that is my type.</p>
<p>The girl I like. Long bright blonde hair, nice flowery scent.</p>
<p>– Ah, he just recalled someone!</p>
<p>– Sh-, shut up! There is no such person, idioot!</p>
<p>That complacent smile of the blonde girl wouldn't leave my head.<br />It's not that I like her, it's just that lately, we've been together so much, that's all... really.</p>
<p>Which reminds me, today, we haven't talked that much yet. Today, yet... Haa.</p>
<p>– Well, yesterday, Ichijou showed something good. Wouldn't girls be approaching you before long?</p>
<p>– Annoying, shut up for a bit, will you...</p>
<p>So, that sort of foolish inconsequential chat continued.<br />These days I often feel strange and it is exactly so right now.<br />As if I was accepted into the class, it seems. As if it is one of these night talks during a field trip, isn't it? It is unlike me, but I am honestly glad that I was accepted.</p>
<p>Well, the meaning of yesterday's talk is only known to the boys.<br />Girls are not supposed to know what happened between me and Nakamura... except her.</p>
<p>So.<br />There is always a surprise attack waiting for you when you feel completely at ease. Of all things, Nakamura the bastard, whom I have forgiven with so much trouble, betrayed me.<br />He was broadly grinning. As if wanting to say "<em>Caught you, Potter!</em>"</p>
<p>– Ichijou. Some time ago, haven't you been in the city together with Tachibana-san.</p>
<p>~~! You!!<br />Needless to say, I was closely questioned for a long time after that.<br />However, it was really unlike me. I used to not say a word at school and go home, but now... it was entirely different. I feel like, probably since I have met Tachibana, something started to change.</p>
<p>The smell that comes when raindrops that fell onto the earth are dried by the sunlight... It feels like that.</p>
<p>And then, by the time they agreed that it couldn't be helped as we had things to do for the school trip, we had to go home.</p>
<p>Let alone overnight-cramming, there was a mood to round off the party by the evening.<br />The room was so messy, just like a certain town after Walpurgis Night<a title="&lt;a href=&quot;https://img00.deviantart.net/3f68/i/2011/268/1/4/walpurgis_night_by_darcia1-d4avrks.jpg&quot;&gt;Witch&lt;/a&gt;" href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-232"><sup>3</sup></a> came. Everyone wanted to help with tidying up, but Tachibana said that she doesn't really mind.</p>
<p>And yet... When I turned around thinking "<em>well then, let's go home</em>", my sleeve was pulled from behind.<br />I was completely accustomed to that feeling. For some reason, I even felt relieved. When I turned around, blonde girl was happily smiling.</p>
<p>"<em>Hey, help me with tiding up?</em>"</p>
<p>"<em>It's okay, but let's get everyone to help. There's a lot of garbage."</em></p>
<p>"<em>It's alright, remain here alone. Please...</em>"</p>
<p>If you make such a worried face, there's no way I can refuse, is there?<br />I was about to start broadly smiling too. Just a little more and it would show on my face as "<em>Alright, don't worry</em>". Also, I myself... understanding that today I will speak with her again, felt relieved.</p>
<p>But, why do I feel like this...?</p>
<p>– Tachibana, can I borrow your toilet? You guys just go ahead.</p>
<p>Before giving it a thought, I called out to my classmates who were about to go home.</p>
