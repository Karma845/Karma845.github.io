<h3>Chapter 6: Three Colors Squadron, Sermon, and Future Plans</h3>



<p>The first time I met Black Knight was when I was in my third year of middle school.</p>



<p>I was coming home late from school and tried to take a shortcut through a narrow alley on my way to cram school. Unfortunately, that’s where I encountered a monster.</p>



<p>“Well, well, well, I never expected to be found by a human,” said the monster.</p>



<p>The existence of this monster, known as the Black Knight, had been rumored as an urban legend even before I met him. It was a creature that attacked people from the shadows. While its existence hadn’t been widely acknowledged because it appeared and disappeared repeatedly, its victims had been steadily increasing, enough to disrupt our daily lives.</p>



<p>What stood before me at that moment was a four-armed monster wearing something like a gas mask.</p>



<p>“Nice to meet you, young lady. I am the Atmospheric Monster Gas Air,” he introduced himself.</p>



<p>I tried to run away immediately, but I couldn’t take a step. Instead, my body collapsed to the ground.</p>



<p>“I-I can’t breathe.”</p>



<p>Well, I could breathe faintly, but at that moment, it felt like my ability to breathe was forcibly limited to the bare minimum necessary to keep me conscious.</p>



<p>“Oh my, you seem to be in distress. Can’t breathe much, can you? Don’t worry; I haven’t created a vacuum. To savor the fear as your breath gradually fades away, moderation is necessary.”</p>



<p>“It’s unbearable… Help…”</p>



<p>I was in agony. I felt the clear presence of death, and tears flowed uncontrollably.</p>



<p>The monster, peering into my face, had a smile that seemed ecstatic.</p>



<p>“Oh, that’s good! Very good! However, it’s not enough yet! I want to see more! Taste more! For that, we need a place where lots of toys gather.”</p>



<p>Looking back now, it wasn’t just me who was in danger. This monster had the ability to manipulate air, and what he intended to do was mass murder using that power.</p>



<p>“No, I can’t take it anymore. I need to eliminate all the air in this area.”</p>



<p>“Hey!”</p>



<p>A voice, not mine or the monster’s, echoed. The monster immediately turned toward the voice.</p>



<p>“You! The dark one!”</p>



<p>The next moment, there was a light “thud” sound in the alley. Suddenly, I could breathe, and as I desperately gasped for air, I looked up. The monster who had been in front of me had lost his head and collapsed.</p>



<p>“Is that guy aiming for me?… Well, it doesn’t matter either way.”</p>



<p>In place of the monster, there was a man dressed in armor like the ones you see in anime and manga. He threw something that looked like a ball to the ground.</p>



<p>“Huh!?”</p>



<p>It was the monster’s severed head, the same one that had tormented me just moments ago.</p>



<p>Startled by the gruesome sight, I unintentionally called out to him.</p>



<p>“U-um, excuse me…”</p>



<p>In the moonlight, his figure was much more mechanized than I had imagined. He wore an all-black suit that covered his entire body, with a mask covering his entire head, emphasizing his elongated compound eyes. Plates and worn-out paint covered his shoulders, chest, legs, and arms as if they had been forcefully attached. Extending from his shoulders and chest were cords and pipes. The number “0” was engraved on his chest.</p>



<p>His appearance was so otherworldly that I couldn’t help but be fascinated.</p>



<p>“Who are you?”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>As he tried to address me, he suddenly turned to look behind him.</p>



<p>At the end of his gaze, I saw a girl with long hair sitting on top of a pile of old appliances in the corner of the alley.</p>



<p>“When that guy was tormenting you, you didn’t come to help, did you? Who are you?”</p>



<p>“I’m neutral. I don’t side with humans or monsters. But I like you.”</p>



<p>It was a sudden confession.</p>



<p>He moved cautiously, positioning himself to my back and raising his fists as he spoke to the girl. She raised both her hands in a sign of surrender while wearing a wry smile.</p>



<p>“Nice to meet you. I’m Alpha. I came here to be your friend. Please be good friends with me.”</p>



<p>The girl had an unreal appearance, as if she had stepped out of a painting. However, for some reason, I couldn’t even remember the name she mentioned, let alone her memorable appearance.</p>



<p>The boy and the girl seemed to be having a conversation, but I couldn’t hear their words, and my memory abruptly cut off at that point.</p>



<p>That was the beginning of my encounter with him, Black Knight, or rather, Katsumi-kun. He probably doesn’t remember it, but he was undoubtedly my savior.</p>



<p>“Akane, Akane!”</p>



<p>“Ugh?”</p>



<p>…Looks like I accidentally fell asleep.</p>



<p>“What are you doing? We’ve reached the president’s office.”</p>



<p>Kirara woke me up as I was dozing off, leaning against the elevator wall.</p>



<p>She speaks with a strange Kansai dialect when she’s acting as Yellow, but she talks normally at other times.</p>



<p>Well, for us, it can be quite confusing…</p>



<p>“President, what’s this about?”</p>



<p>“Did you come up with another weird gag?”</p>






<p>Justice Crusader headquarters.</p>



<p>This place, unknown to the general public, is a building owned by a global corporation and is protected by the government.</p>



<p>The president of this corporation is Kanzaki Reima, the brilliant scientist who appointed us as Justice Crusaders and created combat suits for us to fight against monsters.</p>



<p>Today, I had been called by him and had made my way to the president’s office on the top floor of the headquarters.</p>



<p>“Excuse me. President, the Justice Crusaders have arrived.”</p>



<p>As I said this in front of the door, it opened automatically.</p>



<p>In the middle of the president’s office, there were three desks and chairs like the ones used in schools, and a whiteboard was set up in front of them.</p>



<p>“You’re here, everyone.”</p>



<p>“President… What’s with the way you’re talking?”</p>



<p>“You really don’t suit formal language.”</p>



<p>“The dissonance is incredible.”</p>



<p>“Ngu, sharrappu!”</p>



<p>With an irritating accent, the man who appeared in front of us spoke. He had slicked-back blond hair and a slim figure.</p>



<p>Kanezaki Corporation’s representative director and president, Kanzaki Reima.</p>



<p>He appeared in front of us with a serious demeanor different from his usual eccentric behavior.</p>



<p>He was wearing a slightly plain outfit that somewhat resembled a teacher’s costume on top of his lab coat.</p>



<p>“The teacher is very angry.”</p>



<p>“H-Huh…?”</p>



<p>Teacher? Was this person dressed up like a teacher on purpose?</p>



<p>It’s not surprising considering how he always goes by appearances, but what could he possibly want this time?</p>



<p>At least I haven’t used the suit without permission, and I can’t think of anything I’ve done to anger him.</p>



<p>“You guys shouldn’t trick him into calling you by name… Even the teacher would be disgusted.”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>We were caught red-handed.</p>



<p>We took our seats at the provided desks, and the president approached the whiteboard with a contemplative expression.</p>



<p>“Let’s hear your excuses.”</p>



<p>Should I be the one to speak?</p>



<p>Though all three of us were involved, I was the one who proposed it.</p>



<p>“I asked him to call me by name and he wouldn’t, so I thought maybe I could create an opportunity at least…”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://gadgetizedpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/00060.jpeg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>“I can’t say I don’t understand your feelings, but it was a bad move to do that.”</p>



<p>He stated a valid point, and I was left speechless.</p>



<p>Honestly, I feel bad about what I did to him.</p>



<p>But I thought that in order to get closer to him, he should at least call me by name, so I decided to try something a little daring.</p>



<p>“He’s sensitive to malice, whether good or bad. He must be quite shocked that you did that, especially coming from you.”</p>



<p>“…Katsumi-kun.”</p>



<p>In other words, he still had some level of trust in us. We, who had treated Katsumi-kun in such a way, were collectively feeling down after being objectively criticized.</p>



<p>“But that assertiveness wasn’t a bad thing. To open his heart, that level of assertiveness is necessary.”</p>



<p>“Was the mistake in the way we did it?”</p>



<p>“Exactly. No matter how much you tease him, he won’t forcibly push you away. In other words, he responds to you at a ratio of 8 Tsun to 2 Dere…!”</p>



<p>While writing on the whiteboard, the president explained.</p>



<p>However, I’m not optimistic enough to be happy with just that explanation.</p>



<p>“But, when I hugged him while he was having a nightmare, he vomited…”</p>



<p>I gathered my courage, and my heart was pounding, but I never expected such a reaction.</p>



<p>Maybe I got too familiar…</p>



<p>“No, that was a good judgment. Your response at that time was correct.”</p>



<p>It still feels pretty dangerous to be disliked to the point of vomiting.</p>



<p>“That wasn’t your fault.”</p>



<p>“…Huh?”</p>



<p>“After he has a nightmare, it’s always like that. That’s why mental care for him is essential.”</p>



<p>I felt a tightening sensation in my chest.</p>



<p>It wasn’t relief that I hadn’t made him feel so disgusted that he vomited. It was frustration about the abnormality happening to Katsumi-kun.</p>



<p>At that moment, Katsumi-kun was having an unusually intense nightmare, and he looked like a child seeking help.</p>



<p>“What exactly happened in Katsumi-kun’s past?”</p>



<p>When I asked this, the president put his hand on his chin with a troubled expression.</p>



<p>“We have investigated his past on our end. But I can never tell you.”</p>



<p>“Why not!?”</p>



<p>“Undoubtedly, you would sympathize with him. You would empathize with his situation, treatment, and sorrow, and you would see him from a different perspective than before. I can’t allow that to happen to you, who will be dealing with him.”</p>



<p>Is it really that terrible?</p>



<p>I had a sense of it, considering that he was orphaned, but…</p>



<p>“Then, it’s impossible. Do you want us to befriend him out of sympathy? Do you want us to lick each other’s wounds? Isn’t that right?”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>“But if you still want to know that badly, be prepared. The hell he saw when he was seven is beyond what is whispered about on the internet, more than just a joke.”</p>

<p>As easy as it is to ask about his past here, the president is right.</p>



<p>We have to open Katsumi-kun’s heart on our own with our power.</p>



<p>“Well, his vitality and mood fully recovered afterward with the high-quality meat sushi delivered.”</p>



<p>“Whaaat!?”</p>



<p>“Well, you guys requested it as an apology, didn’t you? You were eating together.”</p>



<p>After lecturing us like this, Katsumi-kun’s mood was completely restored thanks to meat sushi!?</p>



<p>N-No, I was kind of excited about the delivery itself! True, I had a smile on my face when we were eating, but…!</p>



<p>We were on the verge of collapsing in our chairs at the president’s words, which disrupted the atmosphere itself.</p>



<p>“Now that the lecture is over, I’ll return to my usual self.”</p>



<p>With a look of annoyance, he tossed his white coat onto the floor and returned to his usual playful self, messing up his slicked-back blonde hair.</p>



<p>“The other day, I conducted a physical examination on him to investigate the side effects of the Proto Suit he’s been using.”</p>



<p>“And what were the results?”</p>



<p>The Proto Suit he used to transform into Black Knight is different from the Justice Suits we use, and it can pose a danger to the wearer.</p>



<p>He’s been using it for nearly two years, so it wouldn’t be surprising if he had been suffering from some hidden side effects.</p>



<p>“He’s in perfect health. No signs of reduced lifespan, and not a trace of the Proto Suit’s effects.”</p>



<p>“Is it possible that the Proto Suit was harmless from the beginning?”</p>



<p>“No.”</p>



<p>The president replied immediately to Aoi’s question.</p>



<p>“If someone other than him wears it, it will explode from the inside. Otherwise, the body won’t withstand the load, and it will self-destruct and lead to death. Of course, that hasn’t changed, and only he can wear the Proto Suit without any risk.”</p>



<p>“…So it was such a dangerous thing.”</p>



<p>“That’s precisely why he’s special.”</p>



<p>With that, the president shifted his gaze to the tablet in his hand.</p>



<p>“He’s just an ordinary person. While his upbringing may have been unfortunate, there haven’t been any incidents where his body underwent any transformations. Personally, I had expected the worst, like him turning into a villain, but… he’s truly an unusual individual.”</p>



<p>“Don’t joke about him turning into a villain, please…”</p>



<p>Turning into a villain is no joke.</p>



<p>With that meaning behind my glare, the president shrugged casually.</p>



<p>“Isn’t it scarier when the mystery remains unsolved? After all, we have no idea why.”</p>



<p>“Come on, President! I think you shouldn’t say it like that!!”</p>



<p>“Yeah! When I’m not being serious, I’ll speak in pseudo-Kansai dialect! You guys are all so bland, I can’t tell you apart!”</p>



<p>“Ugh, that’s harsh…”</p>



<p>This was the first time Kirara had spoken since we arrived here, and the president forced her to speak in a Kansai dialect while pointing at her. Even though I’ve seen this exchange many times, I wonder if he has some kind of obsession with it?</p>



<p>“The Human Enhancement Power Suit that I created with all my talent and life. In short, the Justice Morpher, has successfully countered the threat of villains.”</p>



<p>“It’s not shorter at all.”</p>



<p>“Thanks to that, I collaborated with the government and formed the Justice Crusaders, and you guys were found through a test to identify people compatible with the suit disguised as a normal health examination !”</p>



<p>What he’s doing is really part of an evil organization, isn’t it? I understand the need for secrecy, but it really amplifies the mad scientist vibe he’s giving off.</p>



<p>“But the Justice Morpher, if it unites the powers of three people, then the Black Knight, no! The Justice Morpher Prototype Zero was a stage before that, designed to control immense energy with a single suit! Therefore, one person must handle the functions that should be divided among three!”</p>



<p>The president, with great enthusiasm, wrote on the whiteboard while holding a pen.</p>



<p>“But! The Proto Suit was not designed to generate such output, and, in fact, its performance was inferior to even the next-generation suits. In other words, it was a defective product! A failure!”</p>



<p>Is it like putting a sports car engine into an ordinary car?</p>



<p>“That’s why, with a heavy heart, I decided to dispose of it… or so I thought. But by some cruel twist of fate, the Proto Suit ended up in the hands of a middle school student, Katsumi Homura!”</p>



<p>Yes, Katsumi-kun has been fighting since middle school. Even though he didn’t engage in full-scale battles until high school, it’s still abnormal in every sense.</p>



<p>“Why can he bring out the suit’s performance? Why can he defeat villains? Why can he continue to use it without any risk? I absolutely must know his secret! I’m prepared to do anything, even swim naked in the freezing sea, to find out!”</p>



<p>Why do you have to make such a resolution?</p>



<p>The president, who had completely entered mad scientist mode, shouted for a while before suddenly regaining his composure.</p>



<p>“So, soon, we will have him wear the suit and measure his abilities.”</p>



<p>“What!? You’re saying that so casually!”</p>



<p>“He already gave his permission. He’s been here all this time and probably wanted to walk around the headquarters. He agreed immediately. Well, he did reject the new suit I made for him, though. Hahaha!”</p>







<p>The president, who was overly prepared, left me speechless.</p>



<p>“Also, there’s something I wanted to tell you today.”</p>



<p>With that, the president turned towards us.</p>



<p>He took out a tablet from his pocket and manipulated it, and a familiar voice from the recording began to play in his office.</p>



<p>“Are there any other villains who were stronger?”</p>



<p>“Well… troublesome ones were the intangible ghost-type villains. As for those with psychic powers…”</p>



<p>This is the audio from the questionnaire Katsumi-kun filled out the other day, right?</p>



<p>I can hear Dr. Shirakawa’s voice too, and this question was about the villains Katsumi-kun had encountered so far, I think.</p>



<p>“Is this the audio from the questionnaire Katsumi-kun answered?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s the questionnaire you guys added your selfish questions to.”</p>



<p>“You allowed it, didn’t you!?”</p>



<p>The president is just as much a co-conspirator!</p>



<p>He comforted a trembling Kirara, and the recorded conversation shifted to the next topic.</p>



<p>“And, that’s not all.”</p>



<p>“…I don’t know, but what kind of villain is it?”</p>



<p>The audio is missing here for a moment. I can tell that Katsumi-kun mentioned the name of a villain, but it’s silent, and I can’t make it out.</p>



<p>“…I guess you couldn’t hear it after all.”</p>



<p>With a slightly puzzled look at us, the president stopped the audio.</p>



<p>“As per the government’s instructions, we are going to publicly release this audio.”</p>



<p>“What? You’re going to release it?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I added information about the villains you heard from him to the questionnaire. But we’ll remove some of the information on our side as well. There are some tricky issues mixed in with that.”</p>



<p>With no words to respond, the president continued to speak.</p>



<p>“The government also can’t ignore the Black Knight’s achievements. You might not realize it, but… the villains Katsumi mentioned in the questionnaire could potentially bring disaster on a global scale, not just in Japan.”</p>



<p>“!!!”</p>



<p>I can understand if it’s a villain like “Smiley,” but what about other seemingly harmless ones like slugs?</p>



<p>“In terms of revealing some of his life and personality, the contents of that questionnaire are quite convenient. Oh, he gave his consent for this as well.”</p>



<p>“He gave his consent?”</p>



<p>“He realized he couldn’t refuse. But if you think about it, this might be for his own good.”</p>



<p>The president picked up a piece of paper from his desk and looked at it.</p>



<p>“He has a mischievous side, so this might even increase his popularity with women! Hahaha!”</p>



<p>“Your behavior is too old-fashioned…”</p>



<p>I’m exasperated by the president’s vulgar laughter, but he continues to laugh unabashedly.</p>



<p>“If I’m honest, I want him to be on our side. After all, there are still only three warriors protecting this country. If you were to fall, there would be no one left.”</p>



<p>“But what about Omega…”</p>



<p>“Yeah, he’s been defeated. But what if it’s not really over?”</p>



<p>“…”</p>



<p>I’m left speechless by the president’s words. I can also sense that unsettling possibility.</p>



<p>“That’s why we need his power. To do that, we must befriend him and raise his favorability… Justice Crusaders!”</p>



<p>“Is this a serious discussion…?”</p>



<p>“It’s become very cheap all of a sudden.”</p>



<p>“A complete disaster.”</p>



<p>I don’t know how to respond when given orders like this, as if it were some sort of joke.</p>



<p>The president, clearly annoyed by our attitude, leans forward on his desk and points at us.</p>



<p>“Stop making noise!! Isn’t it your fault in the first place for being so incompetent!!”</p>



<p>“What do you mean ‘incompetent’!? We’ve been thinking about the appropriate distance and everything!”</p>



<p>“Your distance control is extremely off, which is why we had to give you this warning!”</p>



<p>“In your face! We had to caution you because of your weird behavior!”</p>



<p>Imitating Kirara’s voice, the president makes a strange noise by pinching his nose, still mimicking her. I hear what sounds like something tearing next to Kirara.</p>



<p>“I’ll rip your spine out right here!!”</p>



<p>“Kirara! If you get mad here, it’s what they want!”</p>



<p>“It’s like a chivalrous film! Just like a chivalrous film!”</p>



<p>Kirara tries to reach for Justice Morpher, and Aoi and I do our best to stop her.</p>



<p>Despite how noisy and annoying the president is…!! He’s a significant person treated as the savior of humanity!!</p>


<p>[Chat] Thread about Black Knight-kun 2</p>



<p>■TOP ALL 1 &lt;&lt; 100 100&gt;&gt; NEW 50</p>



<p>451: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />An outrageous bomb has been dropped, hasn’t it<br />Those shocked by Black Knight-kun’s real voice<br />Those who died from indignation at their favorite food being insulted<br />Undertaking the noble sacrifice of overanalyzing their favorite food and harboring darkness<br />But…<br />Where do we even start analyzing this? (Irritated)</p>



<p>452: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The voice sounds a bit young but cool</p>



<p>453: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Aren’t the interview questions packed with personal feelings?<br />LOL</p>



<p>454: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />There are unnatural cuts so it’s clearly edited but a lot of information was disclosed, they really went all out huh</p>



<p>455: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The doctor asking the questions is also mischievous and cute</p>



<p>456: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Yes, catfish<br />Don’t pretend to be innocent, you criminal<br />What the hell, hamburgers, you damn brat</p>



<p>[Chat] Thread about Black Knight-kun 2<br />It would’ve been better if he just self-destructed</p>



<p>457: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />First I’m shocked by the revealed definition of villain<br />He’s not acting evil, he just wanted to live freely<br />He’s probably influenced by his environment to think that’s bad</p>



<p>458: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />At least for Black Knight-kun, being in an environment where things were taken from him was normal<br />Despite believing himself a good person, he only kept getting robbed, so he decided to become a villain</p>



<p>459: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Of course, I think natural idiocy is also involved but I get it</p>



<p>460: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Since his values differed so much from society that he was suffering… Possibility of that environment arises…</p>



<p>461: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />How his favorite food tastes childish… He did say he doesn’t have parents right?</p>



<p>462: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />This guy is way too dangerous<br />The gap between what he says and does is too extreme<br />If he comes out into the open, who’s gonna stop him?<br />Even Justice Crusader barely managed to defeat him with great difficulty<br />And that was against Black Knight with outdated gear<br />Why don’t you guys understand how dangerous this is?<br />There’s no guarantee someone who can easily dispose of monsters won’t harm humans<br />In the first place, this guy is a criminal and villain</p>



<p>463: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Feels too pitiful being told all this just for answering questions</p>



<p>464: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />&gt;&gt;462<br />Awful way to say it but kind of a point<br />I can’t take either side but I also think Black Knight-kun is too dangerous<br />No deterrent other than Justice Crusader<br />If he went all out seriously, probably no one could win<br />The fear is he’s surpassing what we can imagine…?</p>



<p>465: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The premise itself is weird<br />Why are we assuming Black Knight-kun will rage?<br />That only works if he’s tried to harm humans before</p>



<p>466: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Who was defeating the monsters that appeared before Justice Crusader was active?<br />Black Knight-kun right?<br />Rather than his own danger, shouldn’t we consider the danger if he disappears?<br />I understand he’s dangerous, sure<br />But he’s never harmed anyone right?<br />At least not on record</p>



<p>467: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Smiley was tranquilized quickly, no big deal right<br />Believer , If you want to worship Black Knight-sama that much, do it elsewhere<br />Disgusting</p>



<p>468: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Saying Smiley was no big deal, what kind of thinking is that<br />That was a contagious hypnotic monster</p>



<p>469: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />So where’s the proof it’s not made up?<br />Who would believe this shitty fiction<br />Explain it to me</p>



<p>470: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The militant types have appeared again huh</p>



<p>471: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />They always come out when new info drops</p>



<p>472: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Just ignore this kind of thing, it’s stable</p>



<p>473: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />No joke, Smiley was no small matter<br />Because I saw Black Knight defeat Smiley<br />Not to mention completely impressed by his abilities, laughing loudly</p>



<p>474: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Just reading it seems fun but its true nature is wicked</p>



<p>475: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />If you’re infected by Smiley’s power, you can’t feel anything except pleasant emotions<br />For me, I could see reality but my mind was filled with memories of doting on my pet dog that had already died<br />I couldn’t do anything but laugh<br />The people around me were all laughing too<br />If shoulders bumped, the smiles spread further like an infection, I couldn’t even tell if I was still sane</p>



<p>476: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Terrifying</p>



<p>477: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Smiley was humming a tune<br />“Everyone’s happy if they smile and laugh. If everyone smiles, there’s nothing to fear. No matter who dies, let’s blow them away smiling. I’m Smiley, you’re Smiley too. A clown who delivers smiles to everyone.” Smiley was tranquilized easily? There’s no way a mere human could defeat that terrifying monster</p>



<p>478: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Let’s make a movie with Smiley as the subject<br />(Trembling voice)</p>



<p>479: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />What a horrifying monster… Black Knight-kun defeated him right?</p>



<p>480: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight was unaffected by his powers, I saw it myself<br />He wasn’t hypnotized by Smiley’s abilities at all<br />Surrounded by all of us laughing through tears, he didn’t laugh at all<br />Smiley was extremely agitated<br />You’re human right! He even seemed terrified<br />Then he easily defeated Smiley<br />I’m truly grateful now<br />If I get the chance to meet him, I want to say thank you</p>



<p>481: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Does this imply Black Knight-kun is a monster?<br />Or that Black Knight-kun doesn’t even have happy memories?</p>







<p>482: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Since Smiley himself acknowledged he was human, probably different</p>



<p>483: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It should be an ability that absolutely works on organisms, so even if not a monster, it is odd he was unaffected, that must have been the perception…<br />Yet it didn’t work on Black Knight-kun<br />In other words, it means that, I guess</p>



<p>484: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />A monster who made the smiling monster cower in fear. What an intense situation.</p>



<p>485: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />As expected, Black Knight-kun’s darkness is deeper than we imagined</p>



<p>486: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It’s scary that he surpasses our imaginations…</p>



<p>487: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />When I got caught up in Quiz Monster’s game, it was truly frightening<br />A helmet was put on my head, then I could hear Quiz Monster’s voice saying one person chosen as contestant had to answer the quiz<br />If you win, either damage Quiz Monster or escape<br />Lose even once and everyone is killed in collective responsibility</p>



<p>488: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Forcibly assigning the role of contestant to people in the area, with no right to refuse, that’s extremely bad if you can’t reject it<br />And total group penalty for just one wrong answer, no intention of ever letting anyone win<br />Looks aside, an incredibly malicious monster<br />How was that guy defeated?</p>



<p>489: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun beat him by throwing a rock at him</p>



<p>490: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Lol grass</p>



<p>491: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Acting so evil yet paper endurance www</p>



<p>492: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />While you can say that in words!<br />Black Knight-kun threw it precisely on target hitting him from hundreds of meters away far beyond the ability’s range!!</p>



<p>493: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />What’s that, disappointed</p>



<p>494: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />That was the solution to clear Quiz Monster’s quiz<br />He precisely won the quiz</p>



<p>495: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The answer being physics…</p>



<p>496: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Even Tie-Up Monster was just this<br />When there was a serious trend of denouncing Black Knight over Electric Slug Monster, scientific examination of the enemy’s remains revealed its electricity storage was on a separate dimension level, causing great shock<br />If left alone it would have caused catastrophic great blackouts rather than just power outages</p>



<p>497: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He was considered seriously dangerous back then…<br />Everyone recognized Black Knight-kun as bad news…<br />Meanwhile Black Knight-kun was smirking clearly through his mask</p>



<p>498: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He was probably happy to do bad things<br />Cute</p>



<p>499: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />What scientists and ordinary people understood least was the irrationality of Black Knight-kun’s method of defeating the Slug Monster</p>



<p>500: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Simply put, he just beat it down that’s all (around 10 hours)</p>



<p>501: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />For there to actually be someone who can be defeated that way<br />Only Black Knight-kun would execute and accomplish it www</p>



<p>502: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />According to analysis, Black Knight-kun punched Slug Monster to discharge electricity<br />→Black Knight-kun’s suit absorbed the electricity, converting it to power<br />→Punch Slug Monster again<br />→Repeatedly absorbing electricity it seems<br />Based on the info that Justice Crusader suits originally had the function of converting electricity to energy</p>



<p>Ignore his personal stamina and willpower? Such things are unknown</p>



<p>503: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I think the biggest science defiance is from Black Knight-kun rather than the monsters</p>



<p>504: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Normally the suit would get overloaded and short from absorbing too much electricity, but watching the posted surveillance footage, seems he was able to continue punching at full power while replenishing energy from absorption and consuming continuously<br />Too monstrous</p>



<p>505: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />One correction<br />It’s being called Slug Monster but that’s not a slug<br />As a marine biologist I can tell<br />It’s a sea cucumber<br />Don’t get it wrong again</p>



<p>506: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Sea cucumber bro appears, lol<br />Probably writes sea cucumber thesis<br />Your brother got blown up by Black Knight</p>



<p>507: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />No self-respecting sea cucumber would let a man walk over him<br />If you want excitement then show some spirit that’d make you spit out your guts</p>



<p>508: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Co…Cool…</p>



<p>509: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />A sea cucumber acting cool, lol</p>



<p>510: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Sorry to interrupt but can I ask a simple question?<br />At the end of Question 6 Black Knight-kun mentioned a monster<br />Can you make out what he said there?</p>



<p>511: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />What do you mean?</p>



<p>512: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The “After that is…” thing he said?</p>



<p>513: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Doesn’t feel off or anything right?<br />Might just be mic issues making it inaudible</p>



<p>514: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Can’t imagine what terrible guy is on the level of Slug Monster, Omega, Smiley, Phantom Monster</p>



<p>515: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Then it’s misheard or edited<br />There’s other unnaturally edited parts too</p>



<p>516: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun’s reaction to the scheming loathsome Tri-Color Squadron in the final question is too funny</p>



<p>517: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I get it</p>



<p>518: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It’s easy to imagine the Justice Crusader trio charging at Black Knight-kun gripping his favorites afterwards lol</p>
