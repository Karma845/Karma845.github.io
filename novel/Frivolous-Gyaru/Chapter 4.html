<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Group Arrangement</h3>

<p>Pessimistic image - check.<br />Languid school hours passed by. I am as lonely as always, just as sky is blue as always.</p>
<p>As expected, today, I haven't talked with Tachibana Karen again. Far from talking, we haven't even exchanged glances. I was concentrating my attention on the reference book, while she had a lot of people she had to concern herself with.</p>
<p>No, no, why am I even mentioning her name?<br />Everything is the same as usual. I don't get it.</p>
<p>The only thing different from usual, is that 6<sup>th</sup> period on Friday is the long homeroom.<br />I believe that this period of time, that was called class activities in elementary and middle schools, is mostly inconsiderable.</p>
<p>For example, during homeroom we have to choose committee member post class shuffle.<br />Stuff that nobody, apart from a small portion of people, wants to be a candidate to.</p>
<p>However, loners are strong at times like this.<br />They are too used to being silent and can persevere amidst heavy silence. After some time passes, students of the inner circle start to fiercely push the responsibility onto others enthusiastically saying "You should do it!". Of course, leaping flames don't reach outsiders like me.</p>
<p>As a result, at the present term I don't have any occupation like committee member. Success!</p>
<p>Even more inconsiderable is stuff like goal setting sheet for periodic examination.<a title="Apparently Japanese schools have regular interviews in written form. Students have to fill in what results they had on recent test, what are their future plans and means to get better results, what results they expect to get on next tests. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.kousei-juku.jp/wp/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/c00a393e02c996a57d63e6664631f7f3.jpg&quot;&gt;Example&lt;/a&gt;" href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-102"><sup>1</sup></a><br />Apparently it is a common thing at self-alleged high-level schools like ours, but if you fill it in without care and classroom teacher finds it out, there will be no various to complains. Therefore, you can't be negligent with it.</p>
<p>Still, it doesn't bother me.<br />At times like this, being a bookworm comes in handy. Well, I got fourth rank on the previous examination, so I just have to enthusiastically and suitably for teachers write that next time, I want to become first in whole grade. Teacher should buy that. Filling in the form shouldn't take long, so the remaining time can be spent on self-study as always.</p>
<p>It means that I'm almost matchless. Join these two together and I am matchless and without occupation. So strong.<br />In short, no matter how low I fall, for a bookworm loner like me long homeroom is a perfect homeroom.</p>
<p>And while I was immersed in self-conceit with a touch of narcissism -</p>
<p>– Hey! Sit down, you lot! We are going to decide group arrangement for school trip.</p>
<p>... Ouch.</p>
<p>Groups arrangement... What are you here for...</p>
<p>Homeroom teacher Shiraishi-sensei is a young teacher who has worked for less than 5 years.<br />I may say that he is young, but you should not underestimate him. He is tall, has cold look and is popular among both sexes, but when he shouts with his sour look, his menacing image is very impressive. He is as scary as military. Far from being able to retort, it feels like the moment you open your mouth, he will purge you on the spot. Bamboo sword would suit him.</p>
<p>Well, anyhow, after such a teacher pressed a file on top of the platform with a thud, whole class naturally fell silent in an instant.</p>
<p>– All right. As you know, the week after next, we are having a school trip.</p>
<p>School trip? Moreover, week after next...? Oi, I haven't heard anything.<br />After the shocking news, teacher's voice got distant in my head.</p>
<p>Sure enough, as if moving under "<em>From now, assemble with the people you like</em>" pattern, our class suddenly became noisy. I almost hear the teacher saying "<em>You are already high-school students, so choose groups yourselves, you're welcome</em>". I would also like it of you added "<em>You are already high-school students, so you yourselves can decide if you want to go to school trip</em>".</p>
<p>Hmm. How have I been dealing with situations like this so far?</p>
<p>It is a stereotypical, totally common situation that happens frequently, but pathetic me has no memo with a summary of a method to deal with it. By the way, this is already a case of "Ichijou = SUN" taking responsibility.<a title=" This is a Japanese internet slang related to Ninja Slayer. Translation of the original phrase is &#8220;What about the case of Mirrorshade=SUN&#8217;s take of responsibility&#8221; (SUN is apparently for mirrorshades meaning sunglasses). In the novel, Mirrorshade is a ninja who has to take responsibility for making a blunder in a hierarchical military organization. So people use the above phrase when some problem is about to happen, where &lt;em&gt;Somebody=SUN&lt;/em&gt; is on the receiving end of the problem." href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-102"><sup>2</sup></a> Even among loners, you are incompetent of incompetents, idiot.</p>
<p>While I was submerged in self-loathing, guys in the class started changing seats.<br />From what I could see on my sides, boys and girls assembled in groups of good friends.<br />Quite likely, I will be the last one left behind. All would be good if I could just say "Let me in", but I wouldn't be a loner if I could.</p>
<p>Eh, seriously, what am I going to do? While I was thinking so -</p>
<p>– Umm... Ichijou-kun, right?</p>
<p>Surprised, I turned towards the voice.<br />Only then have I realized, that a male student was standing before my seat.</p>
<p>There was a shy forced smile on his face. He had short hair and prominent eyebrows, but lots of freckles around the nose made his face look childish. Apparently feeling quite shy, he scratched the back of his head.<br />I remember this nervous-looking face, but... Dang, I forgot his name.</p>
<p>And as if he has guessed it,</p>
<p>– Ahaha... You don't remember, do you? I'm Komatsu, Komatsu Rei. My seat is at the very back.</p>
<p>Amidst the hustle of the ever noisy classroom, his hesitant voice was quiet.</p>
<p>– Sorry for being rude, but... Both of us are, umm, loners... So...</p>
<p>I shrugged my shoulders and pointed to the seat behind me with my chin. <em>Well, sit</em>. The owner of the seat has gone to some other place anyway.<br />This guy is a life saver. I was saved by a courageous youth on the very brink of a catastrophe.<br />If only I had even half of Komatsu-kun's mental strength.</p>
<p>– It's not rude at all. It makes everything easier when you are that frank.</p>
<p>– Uh huh... Thank you...</p>
<p>Besides, I'm surprised that there was another loner apart from me in this class.<br />Next time, when something similar happens, I should be the one to stand up and do it.</p>
<p>– So, how many people there should be in a group?</p>
<p>– Haven't you heard? Half boys, half girls, total number of 5 or 6 people in a group. Groups are self-catering.</p>
<p>– We have a lot on our shoulders, huh?</p>
<p>– Haha... Sad truth.</p>
<p>Just like that, not having much of a conversation, we sat in silence.</p>
<p>Eh, Half boys, half girls?<br />Everybody in the classroom is divided by groups of boys or girls.<br />That is, are they going to use a lottery at the end? While I was thinking so, finalized groups have already started appearing. What's going on here?</p>
<p>Looking back, I think that today, I have been totally careless.<br /><em>Everything will conclude just like always, like every day</em>. I honestly believed that.</p>
<p>My common sense was once more crushed by the voice coming from outside.</p>
<p>– Hello? Yes, yes, you two. You, weren't you Ichijou-kun?</p>
<p>I was startled. I got it just from the voice. Having turned, I saw the obvious owner of the voice standing there.<br />Tachibana Karen and two girls, seemingly her friends, on her right and left.</p>
<p>– You see, we were left out, you know? Let us in - <em>She smiled</em></p>
<p><em>!!!<br />There is absolutely no way your group was left out. So shameless!</em></p>
<p><em>Tachibana deliberately smiled with her eyes only.<br />Well, she did called me "Ichijou-kun" before classmates who don't know of our relationship, but she was certainly making fun of me, this girl.</em></p>
<p>As expected, her friends weren't exactly happy.<br />One of them was observing me and Komatsu-kun with a vacant look.<br />The other looked apologetic and had a forced smile on her face.</p>
<p>What an extremely awkward atmosphere.<br />It is so awkward, that nearby Komatsu-kun turned to me with a frightened face.</p>
<p>– Karen, we are better off searching further, no?<br />– Ahaha... What should we do?</p>
<p>See, they, too, think it is a mismatch.<br />Quickly go somewhere else, you. Both parties are reluctant here.</p>
<p>– It's all good. Aren't boys all the same?</p>
<p>Was proclaimed with a smile by the simple blonde.</p>
<p>Now that I notice, it feels like surroundings are getting quiet. Don't these guys looking at you feel unpleasant?<br />You three stand out too much. It is spreading onto us too.</p>
<p>– Tachibana-san, was it? You see, I was thinking, there are probably more suitable boy groups for vigorous girls like you, so...</p>
<p>I was so frantic, my voice switched into falsetto mid-way.<br />However, it appears like our situation serves as entertainment for this strange girl.</p>
<p>– Even if you say it, it seems like all other groups are finalized. It's too late now, so sad.</p>
<p>She looks like she is barely holding her laugh.</p>
<p>– It would seem our group is decided. Please take care of us! Lol</p>
<p>Needless to say, it went exactly as she said. What a farce.<br />Naturally, I questioned her regarding this case after school.<br />Yet the more I spoke, the more she laughed and got joyful, so I stopped.</p>
<p>Seriously, what's wrong with her?</p>
