<h3>Chapter 9: Battle-Hardened Warriors and the Emotion-Infused Monster</h3>


<p>On a ship floating on the sea.<br /> <br />Already transformed into powered-up suits, I and the Justice Crusaders were looking ahead at the horizon where the Magma Monster would likely come.<br /> <br />“How much do you think this cost to build…?”<br /> <br />“At least tens of billions I’d think. They said it was made with mysterious technology.”<br /> <br />Though it looks like a small boat, its true form is completely different.<br /> <br />It could be called a “decisive battlefield” made specifically to fight the Magma Monster.<br /> <br />“Are you really sure you don’t need any equipment?”<br /> <br />“I can only use my fists now.”<br /> <br />“But my weapon is amazing! See! It can melt all kinds of things!”<br /> <br />When Red pulls the hilt extending from the Morpher, a distinctive western sword with a red-hot blade appears.<br /> <br />Its shape makes it clear that it’s a crazy sword that won’t melt against the Magma Monster and can inflict damage.<br /> <br />Clearly it’s something a high school girl shouldn’t be swinging around, but this is Red’s main armament.<br /> <br />“Red, stop. He’s a man who’s fought monsters with just his fists.”<br /> <br />Yellow, saying this, carries a double-edged axe over her shoulder.<br /> <br />Despite being an electric type, she goes all in on power.<br /> <br />“But I am a little curious about Black Knight-kun’s lack of weapon.”<br /> <br />Blue holds two rounded blue guns, checking their condition.<br /> <br />Occasionally she shows off the mysterious technology of combining the two guns into a rifle shape.<br /> <br />“…….”<br /> <br />“…Still not used to it.”<br /> <br />Standing shoulder-to-shoulder with them like this.<br /> <br />Normally I jump in reluctantly to help later, but this time I’m an ally from the start.<br /> <br />It’s against my will, but having me here is definitely better if thinking about the worst case scenario.<br /> <br />“The Magma Monster will arrive soon. Very fast speed. Draw its attention as much as possible.”<br /> <br />“””Understood.”””<br /> <br />“Yeah.”<br /> <br />I nod at the communication I hear directly inside my mask, and look at the horizon.<br /> <br />“Wha-…?”<br /> <br />“The enemy’s coming? What’s wrong?”<br /> <br />“No, I just suddenly felt like I was being watched…”<br /> <br />…It’s not my imagination. While staying aware of my surroundings, I return my gaze to the horizon and gradually I can see a small black dot and white steam-like substance.<br /> <br />Ignoring the swaying waves, it heads straight for the ship we’re on.<br /> <br />The monster with the red-hot exterior, the Magma Monster.<br /> <br />As seen on the camera, his left arm is stabbed into his chest rather than its original position.<br /> <br />“Ku…shi…”<br /> <br />“Hm? What is it?”<br /> <br />He’s shouting something.<br /> <br />Having come close enough to clearly see, he glares at me while widely opening his mouth split to his cheeks, spewing out white smoke.<br /> <br />“Kurokishi!!”<br /> <br />He yelled my name loudly.<br /> <br />Seeing the Magma Monster moving over the sea at considerable speed, Red looks at me quizzically.<br /> <br />“Hey, he’s calling your name right?<br /> <br />“He can talk…? Well, it’s not that rare for monsters I guess. I’m aware he holds a grudge against me, but it’s nothing to worry about in particular.”<br /> <br />“Monsters who don’t talk are scarier though.”<br /> <br />“I know right.”<br /> <br />As expected of people used to being on the battlefield, they don’t seem scared even in this situation.<br /> <br />“You’re becoming reli-… No.”<br /> <br />I can’t say that out loud.<br /> <br />I don’t intend to become their comrade.<br /> <br />That’s an absolute promise I mustn’t compromise on.<br /> <br />“Hm? A promise?”<br /> <br />Tilting my head muttering to myself.<br /> <br />“Kurokishi!!”<br /> <br />“Shut up with your one-track mind, bastard.”<br /> <br />Before I knew it, the Magma Monster had come to within 50 meters.<br /> <br />“Vwo…”<br /> <br />“He stopped…?”<br /> <br />Stopping suddenly, glaring at me with his eyes of unknown location while making the sea surface boil and seethe, he widely opens his mouth spewing white smoke.<br /> <br />“It’s been a year and a half. How is it, does the chest wound hurt?”<br /> <br />“Giii!”<br /> <br />“That’s a bit evil against a monster…”<br /> <br />While Red mutters something, I provoke him to check his condition.<br /> <br />He probably gathered power in a seabed volcano or something.<br /> <br />His energy levels are probably maxed out.<br /> <br />But this is the sea surface, not the ground, so we can keep decreasing his power, and most of all, energy is constantly leaking from that chest wound, so he should be easier to corner than before.<br /> <br />“This time I’ll properly finish you off so you can never come back up.”<br /> <br />“Gaa!”<br /> <br />The Magma Monster enraged, shoots lava from his hand.<br /> <br />We immediately jump off the small boat and stand on the sea surface.<br /> <br />“Anti-Magma Monster Submarine. Justice Marine! Surface!”<br /> <br />Reima’s voice from inside the mask.<br /> <br />With a roar, the spot we’re standing on starts floating up, drawing in the Magma Monster and becoming a single field.<br /> <br />I smile at the Magma Monster confused by the object suddenly appearing from the sea surface.<br /> <br />“An anti-Magma Monster submarine for battle… apparently. If he can’t stand on land, then make him stand on the sea.”<br /> <br />The top part of the submarine named Justice Marine has a shape close to that of an aircraft carrier.<br /> <br />It seems small as a battlefield, but the footholds have countermeasures against the Magma Monster, supposedly able to withstand his magma for a few minutes.<br /> <br />“We lured that magma bastard into the battlefield. Now then, shall we do this?”<br /> <br />“Yeah. Me, Yellow and Black Knight-kun will be the vanguard.”<br /> <br />“Gonna smash your arm.”<br /> <br />Red takes a stance gripping the sword in her right hand.<br /> <br />Yellow swings her axe around energetically.<br /> <br />“Blue will provide fire support, ‘kay?”<br /> <br />“Got it, understood.”<br /> <br />And Blue lightly takes a stance with her twin pistols.<br /> <br />I’m grouped with them as usual today, but… they basically coordinate as a trio so I can just charge in and do as I please.<br /> <br />“However.”<br /> <br />“Hm?”<br /> <br />“No matter how foolishly you contrive your schemes, you cannot defeat me, the avatar of this planet Earth.”<br /> <br />Suddenly he’s speaking fluently.<br /> <br />Unlike when he was just rampaging wildly, he seems to have gotten considerably smarter.<br /> <br />“Those bugs over there were first. Next I will burn, slaughter and annihilate even bigger bugs.”<br /> <br />“…You seem quite confident.”<br /> <br />“I am Planet Monster Earth! The spokesman for planet Earth! You are unneeded on this planet!”<br /> <br />He says he’s a spokesman huh.<br /> <br />The monsters so far have spouted pretentious nonsense, but this guy is on another level.<br /> <br />I don’t know if it’s true or not, but in any case, we absolutely have to take him down here.<br /> <br />“But Kurokishi, I will kill y-“<br /> <br />“Shut up!”<br /> </p>







<p> <br />“Gyiii!?”<br /> <br />I kick him in the face releasing high heat, spinning him around with a knee kick.<br /> <br />The Magma Monster, or rather, Planet Monster Earth, slams against the deck with his whole body. Enraged, he starts raising his whole body’s temperature.<br /> <br />“You will regret this, I am immortal.”<br /> <br />“Hurry up and come, annoying bastard.”<br /> <br />“Grrr!”<br /> <br />Earth, trembling in anger, inhales deeply.<br /> <br />Expanding his body, increasing his magma’s temperature, he widely opens his mouth, spewing lava like a muddy stream.<br /> <br />“Baraaa!”<br /> <br />The surging lava like a tidal wave.<br /> <br />He’s as troublesome a monster as ever, but fortunately we’re not so weak as to be taken down by this level of attack.<br /> <br />“Here we go!”<br /> <br />“Hmph!”<br /> <br />I swing my fist and Red swings her sword.<br /> <br />Our strikes released together blow back the approaching lava, dispersing it around us.<br /> <br />“We’re on the sea! There’s no damage to the surroundings so go all out!”<br /> <br />“That was my intention from the start!”<br /> <br />Hearing Reima’s communication, I rush into the magma monster’s bosom.<br /> <br />I pound my fist into his unguarded torso.<br /> <br />“Gaa!?”<br /> <br />“You’re talking big but properly guarding your body huh! Unlike when I punched a hole in your gut!!”<br /> <br />“It seems like being pierced through the torso traumatized him quite a bit.”<br /> <br />He’s encasing his weak point, the torso, with a shell of magma.<br /> <br />“Well, then we just have to rip it off, right?!”<br /> <br />“Don’t joke around!”<br /> <br />“Yellow!!”<br /> <br />Before he can counterattack, I deliver a spinning kick to the monster and launch it towards Yellow, who has already shouldered her axe.<br /> <br />“Smash!!”<br /> <br />Yellow’s strike, charged with a massive electric surge from the axe, slams into the monster.<br /> <br />As the contained electric surge is released, Red follows up on Earth, immobilized, and part of the sturdy shell comes off.<br /> <br />“Surprisingly fragile! Earth!!”<br /> <br />In an instant, she slash across the monster’s back with the returning blade and thrust further.<br /> <br />The blade emerges from the cracked joint of the left shoulder, lava flowing out like blood.<br /> <br />Normally, lava alone would be extremely dangerous, but my suit and the Justice Squadron suits are custom-made.<br /> <br />They provide protection with an extraordinary level of strength.<br /> <br />“Aaaargh!!”<br /> <br />“Whoa!”<br /> <br />He stands up with even more intensity, and Earth drives away Red.<br /> <br />“There’s an opening!”<br /> <br />“G-ga…gaga!?”<br /> <br />Blue, who slid in by her feet, relentlessly targets the weak spot on the monster chest, repeatedly firing aqua-colored energy shots.<br /> <br />“Planet-sized monsters are just too massive…”<br /> <br />“It’s dangerous!”<br /> <br />“What!?”<br /> <br />I kick the leg imbued with high heat that Blue thrusts forward, deflecting the attack.<br /> <br />“Don’t let your guard down, Blue.”<br /> <br />“Kyuuun.”<br /> <br />What was that sound just now…?<br /> <br />With a sense of doubt about the mysterious sound effect that Blue voiced, I deflect the extended right arm with my own arm and lock eyes with Earth.<br /> <br />“If it were just me, the situation might have been different.”<br /> <br />“Black Knight!!”<br /> <br />“Unfortunately, I’m not alone this time either!!”<br /> <br />I punch back at the oncoming lava fist head-on, swiftly closing in and delivering six consecutive punches.<br /> <br />As the impact from the punches threatens to send me flying backward, Red and Yellow slash from behind, bouncing off and delivering powerful blows.<br /> <br />“Ughhh!”<br /> <br />As I somehow endured, a blue energy ball came attacking.<br /> <br />Playing the role of connecting the cooperation of the Justice Crusaders, she kept attacking relentlessly.<br /> <br />“That’s it!”<br /> <br />Kicked to the ground by me, Yellow swung up her axe as if scooping the monster up, blowing it away, and at the end Red’s sword struck and slashed him.<br /> <br />Furthermore, if I try to go on the offensive, Blue accurately targets the monster’s weak points within my field of vision. Alternatively, shooting at its feet forcefully halts its movement, and the same attacks from earlier are repeated.<br /> <br />“This unity feels nice.”<br /> <br />“Don’t babble nonsense. Red.”<br /> <br />“Yes sir!”<br /> <br />Jumping towards the magma pouring down from above like meteors, Red bisects them cleanly with her sword swung vertically.<br /> <br />I can’t help but sigh at her.<br /> <br />“…As expected, you guys are amazing even without me.”<br /> <br />It’s not like I’ve been fighting alongside them for a year as a joke.<br /> <br />Certainly, I helped them several times, but each time they experienced defeat, they used it as nourishment to become even stronger and more robust.<br /> <br />Even taking into account that Earth is not on the ground and has a big wound on his chest, the opponent has far greater strength than ordinary monsters.<br /> <br />There is no doubt that they are strong, being able to fight him from an advantageous position.</p>

<p> <br />“Ooooh!”<br /> <br />“Wow!?”<br /> <br />“This is bad!”<br /> <br />“Retreat for now!”<br /> <br />As Earth’s heat continues to rise.<br /> <br />The fact that they are moving away means the heat is unbearable even in the Justice Suits.<br /> <br />Then, we heard the voices of Reima and the female operator.<br /> <br />‘The temperature around the planetary monster Earth is continuing to rise! Within 10 meters it’s…2965°C!? Still rising!!’<br /> <br />‘It’s not wrong to call it a planetary monster! At this rate of increase it’s approaching the surface temperature of the sun! We need to do something quickly or even this foothold will be dangerous!’<br /> <br />“Then I’ll go.”<br /> <br />Stepping on the melting floor, I jump into the surroundings of the guy.<br /> <br />During the previous fight, what happened in that container was not a one-on-one brawl, but rather I just randomly swung my fists while avoiding his attacks.<br /> <br />The current situation is the same, I just need to mercilessly beat the crap out of him.<br /> <br />“Die, Kurokishi!!”<br /> <br />Catching the red-hot right arm Earth thrusted out in my nonchalantly offered palm.<br /> <br />“Wha!?”<br /> <br />“Is that all?”<br /> <br />Crushing Monster Earth’s fist as I grip it back, I pound my fist into his torso.<br /> <br />“Gah, geh…”<br /> <br />Spitting out lava-colored blood, Earth falls to his knees, releasing tremendous heat.<br /> <br />“Take this!!”<br /> <br />While still gripping his arm, I swing his body around and slam Earth’s back into the deck of the Justice Marine.<br /> <br />The Justice Marine tilts diagonally, and the seawater blown upwards evaporates as it rains down on me, but I don’t care and stomp on the groaning Earth’s head, then tear off his right arm with brute force.<br /> <br />“Gaa, gaaaaa!?”<br /> <br />‘Ka-Katsumi! Pay attention to the foothold! Our lives are in danger!!’<br /> <br />Shoot, Reima and the others are also on the Justice Marine.<br /> <br />“Kurokishi!!”<br /> <br />“Oh I’ll take care of what’s left of your arm too!!”<br /> <br />“Ooooh!!”<br /> <br />While provoking him, I throw Earth’s torn-off right arm behind me, and enraged, he charges at me with his anger boiling over.<br /> <br />It’s good he’s become more emotional, but…<br /> <br />“If you become a simple fool, I don’t wanna deal with you!!”<br /> <br />I land a sharp punch on his jaw, then kick his leg and collapse him.<br /> <br />When he hesitates, I punch him again!<br /> <br />“Gaa!”<br /> <br />Still, Monster Earth tries to attack desperately.<br /> <br />But Red’s sword, which flew in from behind me, pierces and passes through the cracked part of Earth’s shoulder.<br /> <br />“Ooossh! I hit it!”<br /> <br />“Great job, Red!”<br /> <br />While he hesitates, I pound my fist to drain his energy in one go.<br /> <br />“Gu, hih…”!?<br /> <br />From his voice and atmosphere, what I feel is definite fear.<br /> <br />It’s nothing like the mechanical monster spewing lava everywhere.<br /> <br />But I won’t show any mercy.<br /> <br />“Bufoooo!”<br /> <br />“Wha!?”<br /> <br />It’s a smokescreen!<br /> <br />Suddenly Monster Earth spewed white smoke from his mouth.<br /> <br />While trying to disperse the smoke and continue the attack, he’s no longer there.<br /> <br />“””He escaped!?”””<br /> <br />“Huh…?”<br /> <br />Dumbfounded, when I look in the direction I sense him, I see Monster Earth escaping by sliding over the sea surface headed straight for Japan.<br /> <br />“If I can just reach the land…!”<br /> <br />Pitifully trying to get to Japan, Monster Earth.<br /> <br />Seeing his figure, memories from a year and a half ago cross my mind.<br /> <br />‘Black Knight, I’m counting on you…’<br /> <br />‘Protect our family…’<br /> <br />‘In our place…’</p>







<p><br /> <br />The figures of the Self Defense Force members I fought together with to protect Japan.<br /> <br />They fought desperately against him, without running away.<br /> <br />Yet now, at the very end, he’s trying to flee from us.<br /> <br />‘He’s weakened! Justice Crusaders, finish him off!! I permit the use of the Final Weapon… Huh, Katsumi!? What are you trying to do!?’<br /> <br />As I take a big running start, Reima yells at me.<br /> <br />“Wha- Kats… Black Knight!? What are you trying to do!?”<br /> <br />“Leave the final blow to us!”<br /> <br />“I’m gonna blast that bastard!!”<br /> <br />No way in hell would I let this bastard monster escape out of self-preservation!!<br /> <br />Seeing him headed for Japan, I jump off the deck into the sea without hesitation.<br /> <br />Relying on the suit’s bodily enhancements, I kick off the seafloor and run across the sea surface.<br /> <br />‘He ran across the sea!? No, nothing’s impossible for you!! As expected of you! Whe, wheheha!! The ideas for your new suit are flooding out!!’<br /> <br />‘Chief!! Keep quiet for now please’<br /> <br />‘Sorry…my mistake’<br /> <br />The female operator who yelled at Reima falls silent, then calls out to me running across the sea surface.<br /> <br />‘Black Knight! The core of the planetary monster Earth is a small spherical body about 10 cm left of the center of his chest!’<br /> <br />“Got it!!”<br /> <br />I understand the location of the core.<br /> <br />I clench my fist as I catch up to Monster Earth’s back desperately sliding across the sea surface.<br /> <br />“It’s ironic!”<br /> <br />“Wha!?”<br /> <br />“To weaken by gaining emotion!!”<br /> <br />I jump off the seafloor, and with great momentum swing my fist downwards, pounding the monster into the seawater.<br /> <br />He crashes into the spot where the lava he created cooled and hardened, but still I grab his shoulders while he struggles and headbutt him, then start berating him while stomping on his head with the momentum.<br /> <br />“The people who fought you faced you head on!! Yet when driven into a corner you try to flee!! Don’t fuck with me, you gutless bastard!!”<br /> <br />“Mm…”<br /> <br />A year and a half ago, I somehow ended up working together with these Self Defense Force members.<br /> <br />Many other people were also prepared to fight you.<br /> <br />Unlike a villain like me, they fought for Japan, to protect their families.<br /> <br />That’s something I could absolutely never do!!<br /> <br />“Yet you of all people turned your back and tried to run from us!!”<br /> <br />But he tried to flee from us, still harboring the intent to harm Japan.<br /> <br />“Those people risked their lives fighting you!! Yet when driven into a corner you flee!! You fucking coward!!”<br /> <br />“…I am planet monster Earth!! I will exterminate you bastards!! I am planet monster Earth!! I will exterminate you bastards……”<br /> <br />“You’ve got no right to treat humans like bugs!!”<br /> <br />With a frightened voice like a broken record repeating the same words, he brings his right hand regenerated with lava to grab my face.<br /> <br />Despite the alert sounding from the extreme heat at point blank range, I change my raised hand into a knifehand strike shape.<br /> <br />“I don’t need that failed excuse for a heart!!”<br /> <br />Then with all my strength, I thrust the knifehand into the monster’s chest.<br /> <br />Busting through the exterior by force, I grab that which is slightly left of where I stabbed his left arm before.<br /> <br />“No, stop…”<br /> <br />Ignoring his pleas, I stomp on his body and forcefully rip it out.<br /> <br />“Ah…”<br /> </p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://gadgetizedpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/00009.jpeg" alt="" /></div></figure>


<p> <br />In an instant, monster Earth’s body turns pure white and crumbles apart.<br /> <br />Silently, I crush the small ping pong ball sized core in my hand, letting out a sigh at the end of this commotion.<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />I don’t feel the victims have been avenged by this.<br /> <br />But I was able to finish him.<br /> <br />“Time to head ba…Huh!?”<br /> <br />Some kind of sound vibrating the air.<br /> <br />Mixed in with the sound of waves, I hear that sound, so I shatter the cooled lava stone at my feet and throw the pieces at where the sound came from.<br /> <br />Then I hear a <em>bang</em> echo through the empty space, and something falls.<br /> <br />“…Aqua colored…what’s this? Operator, what is this?”<br /> <br />‘A drone!? Why is something like this here!?’<br /> <br />Camouflaged to blend into the colors of the sky and sea, it’s a machine called a ‘drone’.<br /> <br />“Waaaa!? A drone!?”<br /> <br />“Huh…?”<br /> <br />While picking up the drone that drifted here, I tilt my head in puzzlement, and then hear a carefree scream that doesn’t fit the situation.<br /> <br />Looking in the direction of the voice, there’s a fishing boat adrift!<br /> <br />“Oh crap we got caught!”<br /> <br />“Running away’s the best idea! Wooooo! Livestreaming is super dangerous!”<br /> <br />“Awesome, a monster fight! We’ll be famous for this!”<br /> <br />Who the hell are they…?<br /> <br />Civilians, right? Even though this sea area should be blockaded…<br /> <br />Noticing my gaze, the fishing boat tries to flee in a panic, but immediately after, a Self Defense Force ship that seems to have been chasing them surrounds them.<br /> <br />“Waaaaaa!?”<br /> <br />“I told you!!”<br /> <br />Before you know it, they’re restrained. I can only tilt my head watching them.<br /> <br />What on earth are those guys?<br /> <br />‘Ahhh, this is big trouble.’<br /> <br />“What’s wrong Reima?”<br /> <br />‘Looks like the waves reached since we’re close to Japan. Fools, really…they’ve done something thoughtless.’<br /> <br />I still don’t really understand what happened, but Reima is extremely disappointed.<br /> <br />‘This battle has been exposed to the public.’<br /> <br />“What…?”<br /> <br />Faced with his easy to understand explanation, all I can do is respond with a dumbfounded voice.</p>

<p>[Chat] Thread about Black Knight-kun 3<br />■TOP■ ALL 1 &lt;&lt;100 100&gt;&gt; NEW 50</p>



<p>325: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Looking back as an outsider, it’s been an eventful month<br />A month ago some idiot civilian livestreamed Justice Crusader and Black Knight-kun’s battle during the Planet Monster subjugation incident, exposing it<br />The perpetrator who filmed it was detained, still unclear what happened to them afterwards but they probably didn’t get off unharmed</p>



<p>326: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The government really went all out huh<br />Disclosing not only info about the battle from a year and a half ago with Planet Monster Earth, but also the battle from a month ago</p>



<p>327: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I first learned Black Knight-kun uses honorifics from this data<br />And the fact he was 15 at the time really shook me</p>



<p>328: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Seeing the video recording, I really understand why he lost it when Earth ran away</p>



<p>329: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />There were people risking their lives fighting for us all this time without us knowing huh</p>



<p>330: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />An enemy called Planet Monster Earth with abilities like absorbing the planet’s energy making them invincible while on earth is just incomprehensible…<br />The Japan Self-Defense Forces did well to stand against such an opponent</p>



<p>331: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Why do some monsters have shit powers like that<br />Lethal intentions on way too high a level… How has humanity not been wiped out yet?</p>



<p>332: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Because Justice Crusader and Black Knight-kun worked their asses off that’s why</p>



<p>333: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Honestly I opposed Black Knight but requesting cooperation probably couldn’t be helped right?<br />At the time it was a legit crisis on the national, no, global scale. Can’t exactly say my own life is whatever, so I think we have the current peace thanks to Black Knight and the Ground Self-Defense Force members’ efforts</p>



<p>334: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />In reality if not for them Japan would have been finished</p>



<p>335: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />We friggin need Black Knight-kun!!</p>



<p>336: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />No exaggeration, without Black Knight-kun Japan would have ended a year and a half ago</p>



<p>337: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Apparently the situation back then was truly hopeless<br />No telling when Monster would come destroy Japan, and modern weaponry was useless against it<br />Calling in Black Knight-kun seems to have been the government’s last resort</p>



<p>338: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />While the strategy looked reckless, trying it in practice<br />Turned into intense close combat as expected</p>



<p>339: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Magma Monster was already too strong of a character<br />In fiction OP characters like that get taken out early<br />But this guy was seriously bad news</p>



<p>340: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Two years ago the news reported a dormant volcano suddenly became active then swiftly settled back down<br />Was that the event of Monster energizing the volcano then absorbing that energy?</p>



<p>341: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Planet Monster: “I’m invincible invincible with this energy supply!!”<br />Black Knight-kun: “I’ll beat the crap out of you and shove you in a container, get you off the ground and cut off your energy source”<br />His actions are totally crazy right!!</p>



<p>342: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Planet Monster: “Hmph, I’ll melt this container!”<br />Black Knight-kun: “The hell you will!!”<br />Planet Monster: “Ugh!?”<br />Black Knight-kun: “Won’t give you the chance to melt it, I’ll punch nonstop”<br />(Learned from) Electric Slug (Monster) experience</p>



<p>343: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />But Black Knight-kun isn’t a monster or anything really<br />With the theft accusation cleared up this time, he’s not a criminal either</p>



<p>344: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Now that the definition of villain is known, he’s just an ordinary good kid<br />The conversation with the soldier was too sad<br />I’m seriously interested in Black Knight-kun’s past</p>



<p>345: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Well, this thread will also only stay peaceful a little longer I guess<br />The militants will flood back in soon</p>



<p>346: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />My impression really changed a lot this time<br />His politeness was totally unexpected</p>



<p>347: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He basically doesn’t try to talk with civilians, the only ones he spoke properly with were monsters or Justice Crusader who he designated enemies…</p>



<p>348: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />His normal state is too berserk<br />Against monsters he basically just goes all out attacking them by any means</p>



<p>349: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun rarely interacts with ordinary civilians huh</p>



<p>350: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />&gt;&gt;342<br />That’s why I’m saying it’s a sea cucumber!<br />Why do you guys call it a slug?!<br />This really burns my guts!</p>



<p>…</p>



<p>351: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Sea cucumber bro, give it a rest already<br />Want more?</p>



<p>352: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />That time the media forcefully tried to stop and interview Black Knight-kun was a bit strange<br />Even though the interviewer was a super hot beauty, he uncharacteristically panicked and fled</p>



<p>353: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun is weak to hot women…?</p>



<p>354: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I know that story, it was in the news too<br />He seemed flustered, cute</p>



<p>355: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />According to Red, Black Knight-kun doesn’t watch TV or even have a computer<br />So he’s ignorant about entertainers and things like that right?</p>



<p>356: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />A primitive?</p>



<p>357: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />So that’s why he’s musclebrain…!</p>



<p>358: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He’s aware of being a villain but with it revealed the Proto-Suit theft wasn’t pursued, he’s not a criminal anymore right</p>



<p>359: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The government official at the press conference seemed really emotionally invested<br />Well, Black Knight-kun is a minor so it couldn’t be helped I guess</p>



<p>360: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Seems Black Knight-kun was a target for police apprehension due to his individually abnormal combat ability<br />But since only Black Knight-kun could fight monsters, it wasn’t pursued seriously despite happening</p>



<p>361: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Things were really tough on site huh</p>



<p>362: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />This stuff desperately needs to be dealt with properly<br />Guys who poke their nose in just for the hell of it and seriously get victimized by monsters still exist even now, yet they’re still greedily trying to butt in, truly incomprehensible</p>



<p>363: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Antis don’t look at inconvenient things for them</p>



<p>364: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The past combat records are only the Ground Self-Defense member’s recordings, but the one from a month ago is, well,<br />the recording from Black Knight-kun and Justice Crusader’s mask cameras</p>



<p>365: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The cooperation wasn’t by Black Knight-kun’s intention either right?</p>



<p>366: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It says this time was also the government’s request<br />Having painfully experienced that monster’s horror in the previous battle, they probably had Black Knight-kun fight knowing he was the only one who could</p>



<p>367: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Rehashing monster battles can rake in the views and that’s the worst part</p>



<p>368: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />This stuff really needs to be properly dealt with<br />Guys who poke their nose in just for the hell of it and get victimized by monsters still exist even now, yet they’re still greedily trying to butt in, truly incomprehensible</p>



<p>369: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The worst is Black Knight-kun getting unneeded bashing</p>



<p>370: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun himself doesn’t seem to care at all lol</p>



<p>371: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun’s skill at taunting monsters is too high</p>



<p>372: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He’s fought monsters the most after all<br />No wonder his taunting skills increased too</p>



<p>373: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Justice Crusader is strong right<br />Made into a form aimed at the masses, they even appear at events, but each of their battle strengths is high</p>



<p>374: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />They have experience fighting and give off a veteran aura</p>

<p>375: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Justice Crusader’s basic strategy is triple team beatdowns finishing with a superweapon, so in musclebrain levels they’re not inferior to Black Knight-kun<br />They just look cute, flashy, and refreshing to disguise it but it’s a sufficiently dangerous group</p>



<p>376: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />No joke, surrounding and whaling on them is strong</p>



<p>377: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Their tactics are straight up barbaric</p>



<p>378: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I like Yellow’s fake Kansai-ben</p>



<p>379: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The electric axe wielding full power smasher</p>



<p>380: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I heard the character creation was for a regular way of speaking, cute</p>



<p>381: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Looking at the official profile, being good at cooking already establishes stability<br />No personality but a kid with personality</p>



<p>382: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Blue-chan’s laidback feel is also good</p>



<p>383: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Blue’s profile says she likes Japanese sweets<br />Makes you want to say “You just created that character huh”</p>



<p>384: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The story about Blue bringing Black Knight-kun mystery novels as gifts</p>



<p>385: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />While focus goes to Black Knight-kun, Justice are a bundle of personalities too<br />And their voices are cute after all</p>



<p>386: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Hey!! Red is…</p>



<p>387: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Ah</p>



<p>388: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Red is said to be a prodigy swordsmaster who could have become a famous manslayer if born in a different era</p>



<p>389: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Overseas bros and sisses call her Blood Samurai</p>



<p>390: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Do you know why Red’s suit is red? It’s because it’s dyed by the spurting blood of monsters</p>



<p>391: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The lone female really is a different class (meaningfully said)</p>



<p>392: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Red-chan’s affectionate behavior toward Black Knight-kun is kind of nervewracking</p>



<p>393: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Don’t try to defend them!!</p>



<p>394: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Getting labeled as the pitiable and berserker archetypes, their positions are firmly set by laughing www</p>



<p>395: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />But I think Red has the greatest mental fortitude</p>



<p>396: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The battle with Monster Earth this time was like a culmination of that<br />Red and Black as the attack starting point<br />Yellow uses electricity to seal the enemy’s movements and stuns with the axe<br />Blue fires energy bullets without pause to intimidate and create an opening<br />Felt like a battle befitting the Four Color Squadron</p>



<p>397: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Even against a super strong monster like Earth they were basically helpless</p>



<p>398: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />No matter how much you deny it, you’re already the fourth color Black Knight-kun…</p>



<p>399: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun’s suit has insane heat resistance and durability and stuff right?<br />He went straight in punching against MOnster Earth’s heat radiation completely unaffected</p>



<p>400: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It was over 3000 degrees Celsius apparently</p>



<p>401: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I don’t know if I’m the weird one but<br />Isn’t it strange to be able to approach and whack a monster with a body temperature nearing 3000 degrees?</p>



<p>402: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Nothing is strange for Black Knight-kun</p>



<p>403: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He ran on the sea surface like it was natural so he can probably do it physically if there’s any way</p>



<p>404: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun’s battle against Earth summarized<br />-Holds off Earth alone buying time until operation begins (estimated 6 hours)<br />-Uses knockback to shove Earth into a container<br />-To prevent escape, enters container himself and keeps punching (estimated 2 hours)<br />-Meanwhile, left arm is torn off<br />-After dropping it, the risen Monster Earth is stabbed with the severed left arm</p>







<p>405: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Go on</p>



<p>&gt;&gt;404</p>



<p>Continuing<br />-A year and a half later, weakened by the stabbed left arm<br />-Also mentally weakened by trauma of Black Knight-kun<br />-Black Knight-kun, in coordination with Justice Crusader, whacks the hell out of Earth<br />-Rushes into near 3000 degree extreme environment and keeps whacking<br />-Chases the escaped Earth, running on the sea<br />-Rips out the core and delivers the finishing blow</p>



<p>406: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />What is this guy… (Awe)</p>



<p>407: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />What he did seriously seems superhuman<br />Making preparations for the next battle then it actually happens…</p>



<p>408: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Ripping out the core is too slick damn<br />Really merciless against monsters, feels exhilarating</p>



<p>409: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />If it wasn’t a monster this would undoubtedly get an R-rating</p>



<p>410: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />At that scene Black Knight-kun had lost it<br />Because Earth turned his back on and fled from Justice Crusader who desperately fought</p>



<p>411: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Wrong<br />He lost it thinking about the Ground Self-Defense Force members who risked their lives fighting last time<br />Back then, the people involved faced the terrible magma controlling monster without fleeing, yet Earth himself started spouting some nonsense mission and became scum who’d flee when in danger of dying</p>



<p>412: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />There were not a few casualties too…<br />The one commanding on site…</p>



<p>413: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />A Ground Self-Defense Force member who participated at the time held hands with his daughter and thanked Black Knight-kun, that really pierced my heart</p>



<p>414: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Please watch the past coordination between Black Knight-kun and the Ground Self-Defense Force<br />Watch it (sudden change)</p>



<p>415: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Calmly thinking about it, he planted latent terror into the monster ruling earth but<br />With Black Knight-kun’s point of view lines, his absolutely livid anger really comes through…</p>



<p>416: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />“The people who fought you faced you!!”<br />“They risked their lives fighting you!!”<br />“Yet when driven into a corner you’ll flee!?”<br />“Don’t fuck with me, you spineless bastard!!”<br />You can grasp his true feelings from the raw words…</p>



<p>417: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Objectively speaking, he instilled latent terror into the monster ruling earth but</p>



<p>418: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He already tore off an arm in the previous battle, further stabbing that right into the center of its chest<br />Anyone would be terrified</p>



<p>419: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />If likened to something, it’s like the protagonist party after the final boss battle versus the previous work’s protagonist party whose status never fell at all within the story<br />Speaking of mental strength, it was their peak period</p>



<p>420: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />This morning, the official site explained why Black Knight-kun is so strong<br />Too new for the info to have spread yet I think</p>



<p>421: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Let’s check it out<br />XXX</p>



<p>600: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />What the hell is a perfect Proto-Suit compatibility match!?<br />Able to draw out full specs so has power equal to 3 Justice Crusaders combined, that’s just obviously crazy</p>



<p>601: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He’s become irreplaceable for real now<br />With the human experiment suspicion gone too, he’s seriously just a naturally perfect match for the suit, I’m impressed</p>



<p>602: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Of course they’d treasure him<br />There was talk of using him as a guinea pig but before making him into one, they caught someone with more real combat experience as the ultimate wearer, so the need to use him as a guinea pig disappeared</p>



<p>603: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Why’s he perfectly compatible with cutting edge gear from that era?<br />And the development leader says the suit’s capabilities are forcibly drawn out, is Black Knight-kun really human?</p>



<p>604: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />In other words, the hazardous suit that would reject and lethally drain anyone besides the match instead has Black Knight-kun the perfect match where not only is there no rejection, it’s so obedient it wags its tail?<br />On top of that, having its capabilities forcibly drawn out and screaming?<br />And that scream might even be joy?</p>



<p>605: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Personification unavoidable, lol</p>



<p>606: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Is it really okay to spread info like this?</p>



<p>607: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />They’ve probably confirmed with the government so they’re slowly leaking info right?<br />To gradually have people understand Black Knight-kun’s abnormality and importance<br />and such</p>



<p>608: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Anyway this info will probably stir up huge waves again</p>
