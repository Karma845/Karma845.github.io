<h3>Chapter 26 &#8211; School Caste ②</h3>

<p>Well, I may have lost consciousness, but I was awake in a few minutes.<br />Desperately trying to protect the polished ranked four brains, <em>snicker</em>, it seems my damn hard skull has done a great job. Good, good, my aunt's wonderful breakfasts were effective for sure.</p>
<p>However, if I hadn't woken up fast, they would probably have called the ambulance. In any case, in order to keep an eye on my condition, I was lying in the infirmary since 4<sup>th</sup> period. This is a slightly fresh feeling. To think that I would be permitted to lie in bed in school. It doesn't hurt as much already, but I'll use this chance to cut classes.</p>
<p>Within the atmosphere of lunch break, my consciousness was weakly fluttering.</p>
<p>Curtains in the infirmary were swaying. Gentle breeze was touching the skin on my arm.<br />I can hear distant clamor and sounds of ball from the half-open window.</p>
<p>I thought, <em>this is so strange</em>. At this time, I should have been in my seat, studying as usual. Relaxing like this, isn't it the first time for me?<br />With my body loosened up, I felt like it was about to be swallowed by the bed. So quiet.</p>
<p>And while I was somewhere in-between being sleep and awake, suddenly, a single girl's face came before me.</p>
<p>With wet eyes, she stared at me with a serious expression.<br />Healthy-looking white skin and long eyelashes. Thin lips and gentle line of her nose.<br />And then, that long hair, with a bright golden color...</p>
<p>Oof... Oh my, what a beautiful young lady we have here.<br />It seems I have discovered the Peach Blossom Spring<a title="Basically it is a utopia in the &lt;a href=&quot;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Peach_Blossom_Spring&quot;&gt;ancient fable&lt;/a&gt; of the same name written by Tao Yuanming. The usage here is that of a paradise (or a garden of peaches with beautiful women strolling there)." href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-198"><sup>1</sup></a> right here.</p>
<p>It's unfortunate, but it seems I have been so entranced it feels somewhat unpleasant. I've no words to say, so my desire to escape reality is strong enough to make me start thinking about today's dinner.</p>
<p>Ah, by the way, in "The Peach Blossom Spring" of Tao Yuanming it is written that "They encouraged each other and zealously pursued agriculture, and when the sun set, they went to rest", so in fact, Peach Blossom Spring is not really a bishoujo-land. Rather, saying that it is a tax-free idyllic slow life land is closer to the truth,<a title="You can read the translation &lt;a href=&quot;https://eastasiastudent.net/china/classical/tao-yuanming-taohua-yuan/&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt;. I am not sure, but I believe the part that is quoted by Ichijou is that of the remarks accompanying the original fable. Remarks describe the people leaving in the utopia. Check out the translation of the fable, it will become more clear." href="#easy-footnote-bottom-2-198"><sup>2</sup></a> and it is ironic when I think that "<em>Aren't loners more fit for it?</em>" ­-</p>
<p>– Are you... okay...?</p>
<p>What is this... So it's you, Tachibana.<br />Standing at the side of my bed, she was looking at my face from above. Noticing that, I blinked several times.<br />This person, is like someone different when she is silent and has a serious face.</p>
<p>– I'm okay, like I normally am... Rather, I've been awake all this time.</p>
<p>– It's forbidden to make me worry... idiot...</p>
<p>Tachibana vigorously sniffled and wiped her eyes with her sleeve.</p>
<p>– ... Seriously, it's forbidden</p>
<p>– I'm sorry...</p>
<p>It was weirdly silent.<br />Whoa, stop that please. Don't make a face like you're downhearted, say something. "Clumsy!" or "Virgin!", both are acceptable. You're always carefree and now that you suddenly behave in this way, I'm having much trouble with how to deal with it.</p>
<p>And then, I don't know what she was thinking, but she started patting gauzed part with her finger.</p>
<p>– St-, stop</p>
<p>– No... I thought maybe it will get better if I do this... Did it, hurt?</p>
<p>– It does hurt. Anyway, I'm already feeling better.</p>
<p>– I'm sorry...</p>
<p>– Ugh... It didn't, hurt that much...</p>
<p>And again the sour silence fell.<br />Just what do you want me to do? You, recently you've been weird.</p>
<p>Still, it is certain that at this point, the way we interact with each other is in the process of slightly changing.<br />Maybe out of concern, but now there are almost no instances of Tachibana using profanities and cackling like it was in the beginning.</p>
<p>But, it doesn't suit you.<br />I know that there is no ill will, and I don't even mind it.</p>
<p>Well then, would it help if I said "bitch"?</p>
<p>Ugh, it's a bit hard to say it...<br />I'm feeling uneasy about what she would think if I do. That she will maybe start hating me. Even though until now, I haven't cared about it.</p>
<p>It's so strange... both me and us.</p>
<p>– Sorry, I'm keeping silence even though I came myself... haha. It's just that I heard your head was hit and I had a bit of a shock...</p>
<p>It seems that my uneasiness was transmitted, so she made a forced smile.<br />Seeing that, I feel pain inside my chest. Also, for some reason, I know of a very good method how to make her smile with a grin.</p>
<p>Well, it's somewhat embarrassing, but still...</p>
<p>– I don't mind... I'm happy that you are worried about me so much, or how should I say it... Thank you.</p>
<p>Blonde girl was blinking with widely open eyes, and before long she made cheerful face.<br />As if she had a peace of mind, her face became less tense. Seeing that, I felt relieved.</p>
<p>It's too easy to understand what makes you pleased.</p>
<p>– Bookworm showed his dere side...<a title="I&#8217;m dropping my attempts of trying to localize the tsundere part of the novels. If for some reason you still don&#8217;t know what it means to be tsun and what it means to be dere, &lt;a href=&quot;https://kotaku.com/how-to-identify-popular-japanese-character-types-1169085239&quot;&gt;here&lt;/a&gt; is the popular article on the topic." href="#easy-footnote-bottom-3-198"><sup>3</sup></a></p>
<p>– Stop, I say, that is not true.</p>
<p>– Fufu, somehow, I feel energized.</p>
<p>And so, I came to regret my own choice.<br />As for the reason, it is because Tachibana shouted "Yaaa!" and joyfully dived straight onto my bed. I rolled away to the bed's edge right away and avoided difficulties, but -</p>
<p>– Ehehehehe~♪ I'm lying next to bookworm.</p>
<p>Tachibana is right next to me. She is lying so close that her hair is touching my face.<br />Her usual perfume is pleasantly fragrant.<br />Naturally, she is in her usual happy mode with a complacent smile on her face. I have indeed not thought that she would do this. I want to turn my face same as ever, but with this posture, there are only two directions available: look up or in front.</p>
<p>Feeling relieved, feeling embarrassed...<br />Still, she is happy, so I am happy too, or something...</p>
<p>My face is on fire. And as far as I can see, Tachibana's face is slightly red too.<br />We, I feel like we are having some secret talk even in the pauses in our conversation.</p>
<p>– Uh... You, you're always too carefree.</p>
<p>– I am happy... It can't be helped, right? When you show your dere side, I become seriously happy. And you... Which of my actions make you happy?</p>
<p>– I don't really...</p>
<p>– Nooo, stay dere a bit more. You turn into tsun too quickly...</p>
<p>The pace at which her facial expressions repertoire increases is really too fast. Hey, don't act spoiled at the critical moment, it's a foul play.<br />Pulling my shirt at this timing deserves getting a red card and leaving the field, seriously. I would love to leave in her place, but just as I show signs of doing so, the grip on my shirt gets even stronger, what an astute person.</p>
<p>Without a further wish to continue making an eye contact, I turned over.<br />Hmph, If I do this, there is no way to can kill me with your expressions, you bastard.</p>
<p>– Nooo! Turn back here! Come on, come on.</p>
<p>And so, she lightly poked me in the back with her knee.<br />There was quite an itchy feeling inside my chest, so I obediently faced her -</p>
<p>– Welcome home...♪</p>
<p>– I'm, I'm back...</p>
<p>What the hell is this exchange, I'm about to become silly.<br />But on this day, blonde girl was truly merciless. She continues freely bringing out a wave after wave of ballistic missiles with an absurd firepower, so my chest keeps getting painful.</p>
<p>– Hey... Isn't it about time you stop calling me "you". I, hate it a little.</p>
<p>– Ugh... So that's how it was. I understand. Well then, from now on I will diligently call you Tachibana.</p>
<p>– Huh? These are <em>not</em> the words I wished for? It's okay to call me Karen... Jun</p>
<p>– Seriously, stop with the first name. That's, impossible no matter who the other person might be.</p>
<p>– No way... I will absolutely call you that. I will absolutely, absolutely call you that.</p>
<p>– Alright, alright... Tachibana-san</p>
<p>– Ah, that's unfair!</p>
<p>Good, good, this way I can force two choices.<br />This girl can only choose between calling me by my first name and being called by her first name. She will probably choose the latter, but it is hundred times better than the former.</p>
<p>– ~~!</p>
<p>Ho-ho, It's effective, effective.<br />Biting her lip, the blonde girl is making some sort of a complain. "<em>Stingy Jun!</em>". Still, for this time, even if she asks cutely, it is futile. Because honestly, being called virgin is still better.</p>
<p>But while I was feeling elated like this... We received a severe surprise attack.</p>
<p>– You two. What are you doing...?</p>
<p>Startled, I turned in the direction of the threatening voice... where I found standing at the entrance, our teacher in charge - Shiraishi-sensei.</p>
