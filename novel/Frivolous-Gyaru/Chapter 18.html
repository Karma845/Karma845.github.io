<h3>Chapter 18 &#8211; Overtime ①</h3>

<p>However, it wasn't the end of that day.<br />At the time of departure, I have said something that I shouldn't have, so we ended up commencing an overtime.</p>
<p>There is a closing time for the library, so we had to get out before we pass it.<br />Yet when I tried to stand up from my seat, my sleeve got pulled from behind.</p>
<p>Hahaha...<br />Feeling a bit weird, I ended up having a wry smile on my face.</p>
<p>Somehow, this is turning into a standard signal between us.<br />When Tachibana has some final words to say, she always does this.</p>
<p>That is why when I turned around and asked "What?" with my face only, ... unusually, she turned her face away as if she was shy. After glancing at me and turning away several times,</p>
<p>– Um, you know... I'm really happy. I just wanted to say this.</p>
<p>– Happy? What is it all of a sudden?</p>
<p>– I'm happy that you have made a friend again! Why don't you understand...</p>
<p>Angry, Tachibana pursed her lips.<br />Haven't we talked about it just earlier, what are you bringing it up for once more?</p>
<p>However, there was one question.<br />...... Again? What does she mean again...?</p>
<p>She said it as if I originally had a friend. Well, it is an extremely delicate matter if I can call Komatsu-kun and Ogino friends after what happened today. That is why without giving it a proper thought... I messed up and let the honest doubt leave my mouth.</p>
<p>– Again... what does it mean...?</p>
<p>Several seconds slowly passed.<br />That flat-toned one line right now, has it somehow made her angry?<br />For some reason, Tachibana sternly squinted her eyes.</p>
<p>– Hmm...</p>
<p>– Wh-, what...?</p>
<p>– I. Am your. Friend</p>
<p>– Eh, ah... so that's what it was. This is the first time I hear it....</p>
<p>– Virgin idiooot....</p>
<p>Virgin... She often said it to me when we first met, but now it is a bit different.<br />Lately, Tachibana has been calling me using only <em>you</em> or <em>bookworm</em>, and using that word only when she playfully teased me or was angry. Was she holding back? Not that I really care.</p>
<p>That is to say, right now she is angry, and not a little bit.</p>
<p>No, really, I'm not looking down on her or anything.<br />It's just that... what is a friend? Just where does a friendship start and where does it end?</p>
<p>If I remember correctly, we never made such a declaration. There wasn't an instance where we went to have fun. The previous stuff had a job to do as a pretext, so it doesn't count in my book. In the first place, there hasn't even passed a month since we started decently talking to each other.</p>
<p>Rather, was it okay for someone like me to claim to be Tachibana's friend?<br />To be perfectly honest, I cannot help but feel somewhat annoyed.<br />But it seems that this time the blonde girl decided to not show this pessimist any of her usual restraints and grasped my sleeve even tighter.</p>
<p>– Just now... I was really hurt.</p>
<p>– Haa!? It's not like I hate you or something, alright? No, what I mean is that someone like me...</p>
<p>– I. Was hurt...</p>
<p>– It was my fault, alright? We are just normal friends, so for now, please let me go.</p>
<p>– Not a chance! Really, that right now is unacceptable...</p>
<p>Tachibana turned away in a bad mood, and yet she didn't release me.<br />Having said that, she isn't speaking at all, so there was only <em>tick-tock</em> sound coming from the clock. In an empty library, the two of us were standing still.</p>
<p>Still, what do you want me to do?<br />I'm running out of patience here... Dropping my shoulders,</p>
<p>– Haa... So, what should I do? For you to forgive me?</p>
<p>I was amazed myself. I just tried to please someone other than my little sister.</p>
<p>Tachibana was still keeping silent, but turned to me with a displeased look in her eyes.<br />Pouting one of her cheeks, she murmured,</p>
<p>– ... Apology date.</p>
<p>– Don't say something resembling "Hand over an apology Magic Stone"! Do you mean to say that I am shitty administration constantly on maintenance!?<a title="Magic Stone is a in-game currency in Puzzle &amp;amp; Dragons game. Originally, when the game went on maintenance or there were crushes, administration would promise bonus Magic Stones and give them later. After some time, it became a phrase used at any services that went on pause, maintenance, hiatus or have some issues at the moment. Basically, people want apology bonuses. Original version: &#8220;Wabi ishi o yokose!&#8221;" href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-171"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>– Shitty virgin full of sad parts...</p>
<p>– Haa... Alright. So, is it okay this week?</p>
<p>Satisfied at last, Tachibana released my sleeve.</p>

<p>– Not okay. Let's go right now...?</p>
<p>– Yeah, yeah...</p>
<p>– Alright, then... I forgive you!</p>
<p>And that's how today... All of a sudden an overtime started.</p>
<p>Outside, the rain was completely over.<br />Having appeared from the gap between thick clouds for just a moment, an orange ray of light disappeared again.</p>
<p>In such an evening, the two of us were walking the path to the station.<br />It may be close to the station, but it is by no means a lively street. Rather, atmosphere around us gives a desolate and gloomy feeling. On the road from the school to the station decaying apartment buildings and condominiums were standing in row with occasional convenience stores between them.</p>
<p>Still, Tachibana's expression is so bright, as if her previous anger was just an act. She's even humming a song. It seems she has returned to her usual happy mode. A mystery of how her face is even brighter than during the school trip if you like.</p>
<p>... No, it was really a mystery.<br />Usually, your mood is not that good.</p>
<p>– Ehehe... I, am having a school uniform date with virgin♪</p>
<p>– Stop that, do not expressly put that into words...</p>
<p>– Oh, don't feel shy! Come. Here, here.</p>
<p>Blonde girl who skillfully jumped over the puddle. What are you, a grade school student?</p>
<p>– Oi, wait. I say, you're being too enthusiastic.</p>
<p>It felt really weird.<br />I was always going home alone after school, so going together with someone at this period of time is a fresh experience for me.</p>
<p>Additionally, it is with Tachibana Karen.<br />If we go by aunt Arika's words, I am an object suffering from "Illness of Love: Stage 1". Having this girl walking so happily with me, of course I will feel restless...</p>
<p>Feeling reluctant to smile looking at her, I turned my gaze away from her.<br />Getting to Stage 2, the subject's eyes will unconsciously follow the one he loves . How terrifying. However, my seat in the classroom is on the front row close to the corridor, while hers is at the back on the window-side. There are still no worries about that.</p>
<p>But right now, I am in a position where I can see her from behind...</p>
<p>At least, I can say this. I am conscious of that girl to some extent.<br />The fact that I am trying to not look at her, is probably an unshakable proof.</p>
<p>Walking unsteadily like that, <em>poke</em>.<br />Tachibana's index finger suddenly poked my right cheek.</p>
<p>Blonde girl's smiling face is close to me. But a little different from her usual grinning face, there was a gentle smile.<br />Still... Is she even a little bit considerate?</p>
<p>– A, aa... Sorry, sorry. Rather, put your finger away already.</p>
<p>Just as I said it, her smile returned to the usual one, when she makes fun of me.</p>
<p>– Uh-uh. Hey, guriguriguri~</p>
<p>– ~! You!</p>
<p>– Kyahahaha. Here, chase after me!</p>
<p>Saying that, Tachibana ran off. Seriously, I guess you're a grade school student.</p>
<p>... Yeah. It's not like my heart is beating or anything.<br />Aunt... After all, yours was a wrong diagnosis. Absolutely.</p>
