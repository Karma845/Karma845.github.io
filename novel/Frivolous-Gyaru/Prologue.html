<h3>Prologue &#8211; In-school Walking Rules Violation</h3>

<p>Let me be clear, this is absolutely no prize for me.</p>
<p>In the library room after school. Orange sunlight shined from the side and reflected off the desk and bookshelves. It was a spring evening with cool wind, coming from the slightly opened window, felt a little bit chilly on the skin.</p>
<p>It is a quiet place. It was a nice place. With no exams, there are almost no people going in and out. For a gloomy student, who rests his tired soul while studying like me, there are no better conditions. However...</p>
<p>– By the way, ain't that amusing? Bookworm can unexpectedly be a good person. – <em>She smiled</em></p>
<p>The girl sitting on a seat next to mine and looking at my notes - Tachibana Karen. She is in the same class and is ... how do was it called? Oh yes, gyaru. This is not the best introduction, but I really have no other words to describe her. In the first place, we haven't been speaking for even a week, so I don't actually know anything about her apart from appearance.</p>
<p>– Truth is he is a good person who can kindly help with the homework. I should spread it among class, don't you think so bookworm?</p>
<p>– ... Can't you stop the idle talk? Watch attentively, promptly memorize the solving method, please. I want to resume my own studies.</p>
<p>– OK, OK. I got it ♪</p>
<p>So, concerning her appearance, its troubling that she is quite lovely. In short she is cute and all, but in this girl's case she is rather eye-catching, considerably flashy type. While her facial features are all in order, her hair are bleached blond and fairly bright. If you add the way her disheveled uniform looks, it can be summed up as 『In-school walking rules violation』. On top of that it seems she wears perfume, there is a nice smell coming from her.</p>
<p>In brief, for me that is lonely, in other words『walking air』existence, she is the most difficult type of person to deal with. She really is. If I pass by her in corridor, before I even look at her my danger sensor will start working, never letting me to make eye contact. Even now, should our eyes meet, I immediately turn away.</p>
<p>Well, she is cute but ... Even so, what can I do?<br />Far from not thinking anything, the other party comes here to tease me.</p>
<p>Originally, I was coming here to spend my after-school hours in individual self-study.</p>
<p>And yet, last few days I had to help this girl with her studies after school. On the first day I only had to help a bit with the homework. I didn't think deeply into it and believed it to be only for one day. Yet it was the same on the next day, and by the time I noticed it was another next day ...</p>
<p>– Here, I'll summarize everything here. You will be able to do factorization that way</p>
<p>– Eeeh, no way I can notice that.<br />– Like I care... Make it so that you can notice. By the way, you're too close, you can see everything even if you get a bit farther from me.<br />– Fu-u-n?<br />– What's with "Fu-u-n", what "Fu-u-n"! Come on, move a bit, don't distract me...</p>
<p>Tachibana grinned happily. Or rather, I have a feeling she is looking at me as if I'm idiot. At that moment without separating from me, she placed her shoulder on my hand with an 「Ei」and startled me.</p>
<p>– Hahaha... You're every reaction is so amusing. Acting so distressed and strange, are you really a virgin?<br />– You say that one more time and I'll start calling you bitch...</p>
<p>That's right, this girl called Tachibana Karen. A bad reputation was spread among class' boys, that she is a「bitch」that will "eat" any guy that she has taken interest in. It should be well-known, considering even a loner like me knows it.</p>
<p>―― According to a rumor, she was walking with a host-like handsome guy in red-light district.<br />―― According to a rumor, she was talking with a rich looking middle-aged man on the back seat of a luxury car.<br />Well, they are after all unfounded rumors, but being called a virgin, I think it's fair to call her a bitch.</p>
<p>However, Tachibana didn't look like she hated being called that. Rather, she put a hand to her chin as if she was thinking about something.</p>
<p>– You know, it's OK to call me bitch, but...</p>
<p>She curved her mouth provocatively like an imp.</p>
<p>– If we both start calling each other like that, won't everyone think that we get really well...?</p>
<p>......。<br />............。</p>
<p>– You!</p>
<p>– Don't be so bashful. Your face is too red. Look here!</p>
<p>– Stop... Don't poke! And I'm not bashful. And, we don't get well together.</p>
<p>– Hahaha...</p>
<p>Tachibana cackled almost running out of breath.</p>
<p>What's with you... Do you want to study or make a fool out of me, be clear, won't you?</p>
<p>I can't say "This is library, be quiet" card in this situation. That's because there absolutely no one here right now. There should actually be a staff aunty at reception desk. Is she going to smoke, leaving her seat so frequently? That is to say, right this moment in this dusty room there are only two of us.</p>
<p>– Aa, so funny. This can become a habit, hahaha...</p>
<p>You studying is probably no good - she left that kind of impression.</p>
<p>In the first place, why is she having so much fun? Can't understand anything... Still, it's a wonder how she remembers everything I taught her the next day. Why even study?</p>
<p>I wanted to ask, but decided to not. I was annoyed that in that case I really have interest in her.</p>
<p>I'm no more than a plaything for the other person. At most she will get tired of it before long.<br />Thinking like that, I decided to let it pass.</p>
<p>– Haa... I laughed well. Well, teach me next thing?<br />– O, OK...</p>
<p>I'll be repeating, but this is absolutely no prize for me. Instead, it is a calamity, a trial. No, it is a divine punishment.</p>
<p>Without a doubt, the fact that I skipped all preparations for school festival last year infuriated the God of Youth or something. No, if I'm correct, that is not all. To begin with, in the world of Youth, I am a great sinner for being a loner at this point of time. It wouldn't be weird if any type of retribution would befall me.</p>
<p>Loner bookworm whom nobody likes that is me.<br />Centre of the class who always laughs, flashy girl.</p>
<p>This is a story about an NPC-like boy and a gorgeous girl.</p>
