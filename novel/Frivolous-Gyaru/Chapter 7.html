<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Nonchalant</h3>

<p>"<em>Nonchalantly ignore any minor details</em>" is my, Ichijou Jun's, youth philosophy.</p>
<p>I take pride in the fact that the time I spend at school is so repetitive.</p>
<p>For example, if there is free time on the way to school or during lunch break, I will spend it on studying without exception.<br />That is to say, combined with school lessons, all of my human potential is being spent on the scholarly ability. Imagine some country at war period with almost 100% of its national economy invested in munitions, my time distribution has the same logic. The only exception is gaming time on off days.</p>
<p>Pour your heart into the battle, pour your heart into <em>hensachi</em>.<a title="Hensachi is the ranking of Japanese universities based on percentile admission of students. The less the share of admitted students is, the higher the ranking of university. &lt;a href=&quot;https://futurealisreal.wordpress.com/2016/10/09/times-higher-education-rankings-and-hensachi-in-japanese-universities/&quot;&gt;Some explanations&lt;/a&gt;. Basically, his goal is to be better than almost everyone." href="#easy-footnote-bottom-1-130"><sup>1</sup></a></p>
<p>Whoa, what kind of a war-like slogan is this?<br />In some sense, bookworms of this world are the most muscle-brained people. It is generally accepted that bookworms are smart, but is it not actually the opposite?</p>
<p>However, such a regretful everyday life is actually carefree from the bookworm's point of view.</p>
<p>Anyhow, I'm bound by the result, will I prevail over the tests or lose. Only this.<br />I don't care what others think of me as long as I get the results. All the ridicule that I can hear during lunch break can be ignored. If I skip school festival preparations like last year, just how much more animosity will I earn?</p>
<p>Yet, one Friday evening...</p>
<p><em>Sigh...<br /></em>I was absentmindedly sitting on the sofa even though I was supposed to be carefree.</p>
<p>Tomorrow... is the shopping day for the school trip.</p>
<p>Although it was okay to just go to a nearby supermarket, I'm now some sort of great gofer for class queen named <em>Baggage Guy</em>. And I even said I would go alone if she just gave me a memo with a list of ingredients for paella. Moreover, I have to deliberately come to the station entrance.</p>
<p>Also, I had one more concern that got stuck in my head and wouldn't go away.</p>
<p>Is tomorrow actually a date or not?</p>
<p>It is such a big problem, that my brain council opened an urgent meeting.<br />"<em>Is tomorrow's shopping a date or not?</em>" on the agenda. Cute dwarfs with curly wigs from 18<sup>th</sup> century's Europe were unfolding a heated discussion in the parliament building inside my head.</p>
<p>Suppose that it is a date. What should I wear?<br />But isn't it something that good friends do?</p>
<p>First of all, what is a date?<br />Is it a date when a boy and a girl meet at an appointed time? Or is a date only when the partner says so?<br />Is it a safe? Or out? Or fault? Or dive?<br />Eei, what is the scientific definition of date? Let's search for it in the dictionary for a bit. Ah, I've started losing my mind. Calm down.</p>
<p>...Well.<br />My partner is that blonde girl, who thinks God knows what.</p>
<p>By the way, she is also frivolous and famous.<br />She probably knows of the rumors herself. As she doesn't get angry at being called a bitch, perhaps some part of the rumors is true. She always makes fun of me calling me virgin, but if it turns out that she is a maiden, I can later use it as a material for jokes.</p>
<p>I remember how once, some of my classmates had a chat like this:</p>
<p>– Well then, what do you think of Tachibana? She is cute, has a fine chest and nice personality.</p>
<p>– I heard she has a working middle-aged boyfriend. We have no chances.</p>
<p>– Really? I heard she dates Takase from class C.</p>
<p>– She probably eats any guy she takes interest in. Sounds good.</p>
<p>Haa...</p>
<p>It's not that I think anything of it.<br />Every woman born as a beauty is surely like that.<br />Well, I don't know if I will be a virgin forever. The so called "<em>Eternal Virgin Emperor</em>". It sounds so cool, just like a title in Japanese chess world. Such a contrast of name and meaning.</p>
<p>– ...ki!</p>
<p>Hah, everything is just so troublesome.<br />It would be so good if the school trip was cancelled due to the bad weather.</p>
<p>– Aniki!</p>
<p>I... was so spaced out, that I haven't noticed anything until my little sister pulled my cheek. <em>Fue?</em> Unintentionally, a miserable cry left my mouth. Grand failure.</p>
<p>– My miserable face. What happened?</p>
<p>Seemingly, Keyaki was honestly worried about me as she looked at my face.<br />At that time, aunt Arika has finished dish-washing. Wiping off her hands, she came from the kitchen.</p>
<p>– Come on, Keyaki-chan. You're his little sister, you have to sense some things.</p>
<p>– Mm? Sense?</p>
<p>– When a boy suddenly starts to space out one day, it is so obvious that there is now a girl he likes, right? What kind of girl is she? Tell me, tell me!</p>
<p>Romcom shoujo manga artist, wild as always. She looks very excited.</p>
<p>On the other side, Keyaki was intently observing me.<br />She even added a <em>jiii~</em> sound to her stare and glared at me with squinted eyes. So scary.</p>
<p>– Mating season. Turns out my brother is a monkey, huh? It was an eye-opener.</p>
<p>– Ha!? Lies! Don't take seriously everything Aunt says!</p>
<p>– Let me ask then, Jun-kun. Are you staying home tomorrow? Or do you plan to go outside?</p>
<p>Ugh, she precisely stabbed right at my weak point.</p>
<p>– ...I was planning to go to game center with friends from middle high.</p>
<p>– Foolish brother. That is not an explanation for your spacing out. You were more troubled than that.</p>
<p>– Gununu...</p>
<p>Keyaki saw through the main point of my lie. With that, she snorted and turned away.</p>
<p>However, seeing my situation, my aunt became happy saying "<em>Oh my</em>". Then she took out a bill from her purse and gave it to me.</p>
<p>Eh? 20,000 yen!? Is she and idiot!</p>
<p>– No, no, there is no way I can take it. Not like this.</p>
<p>– Taking a girl out costs money. You can pay when you start working.</p>
<p>– No, it's not like that... I am truly going to have fun with friends.</p>
<p>– In that case, you can return the money when you come back. But if you end up using them... If it is a date, I expect so much from you! Oh you, naughty boy!!</p>
<p>Aunt Arika punched me in the shoulder with a <em>bang</em>. It hurts, you hear?</p>
<p>– Ah. You should definitely go buy a condom in the convenience store. Things like that, you have to do them properly.</p>
<p>It is absolutely not a date, shit.<br />Just because I have a duty to go shopping, now everyone is misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Brain parliament, voting concluded. "<em>Tomorrow is not a date</em>".<br />That is why, there is no need to think about what clothes to wear. This is so uncommon. I absolutely need to become nonchalant again. I should try to go with nonchalant clothes.</p>
<p>Alright, I'm a damn genius. Tomorrow, I'll go wearing track suit. I'll do just that.</p>
