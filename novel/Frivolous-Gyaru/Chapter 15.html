<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; Pessimist's Football</h3>


<p>I returned back to my own group after helping others, and waiting for me was delicious paella made by Tenjuin-san.</p>
<p>It has moderate amount of salt with paprika and zucchini in it making it colorful. It turned out to be extremely delicious. Multi-talented super class representative, who appropriately prepared an apron for the trip. But it doesn't end here.</p>
<p>Right after I and Komatsu-kun returned, she gave us the paper plates saying,</p>
<p>– Good work, you two</p>
<p>– Th-, Thank you...</p>
<p>With a slight smile she made a comment that can be easily replied to by gloomy guys.</p>
<p>Whoa, whoa, aren't you perfect?<br />With this, the chat can be finished with a casual reply, so I can feel easy.<br />The fact that rather than getting kindness as big as an ocean, it is more comfortable for loners to receive just enough concern, is not well-known in the world.</p>
<p>After receiving my portion, I sat at the edge of the blanket to eat.<br />With three girls of our group having a friendly chat behind me, I was checking out other groups of our class.</p>
<p>I got a little tired. Or should I say body feeling heavy is characteristic of school events.</p>
<p>There is a space between me and Komatsu-kun, because if I speak with him now, my weariness will accumulate. My brains are tormented even when I speak with people I know, but today in particular, I had too many of what I would call almost first meetings.<br />Anxiety, that weighs on the back in its entirety at times like this, is the painful part of a pessimistic person's existence.</p>
<p>Well, I will just think that class representative's paella was worth it.</p>
<p>...I continued idly gazing what was in front of me.</p>
<p>Under blue sky, clear air. Smell of wet earth.<br />I let all of the clamor created by loud voices of my classmates pass by my ears.<br />There was a good atmosphere. I didn't dislike it. As long as I wasn't part of it.</p>
<p>Haa... What should I do after lunch?</p>
<p>It may be called a group, but we are only cooperating for lunch. After it is the free time.<br />Honestly, I have absolutely no plans... Should I find a bench somewhere and study alone? Luckily I have vocabulary flashcards with me.</p>
<p>Above all, I felt a bit like returning to the usual me, but...</p>
<p>There is a girl who can magically sense loner's subtleties.<br />A girl who is not kind nor considerate, but is just like a natural disaster.</p>
<p>My shoulder was suddenly rubbed by a soft hand. Startled, I turned around,</p>
<p>– Ehehe, thank you for your efforts earlier♪ Are you... tired a little?</p>
<p>Yes, but you know, your existence itself is the main cause of my fatigue!</p>
<p>Tachibana Karen was massaging my shoulders with her whole face smiling.<br />It's good that she's happy, but my shoulders are usually not touched by anyone, so I was really surprised... Also, her long blonde hairs are touching the nape of my neck, so I want her to let me go... But I just turned around.</p>
<p>– What are you doing? My heart will go bad.</p>
<p>– Those guys, weren't that bad, right?</p>
<p>– They were normal, I guess...</p>
<p>Wasn't stuff like this only for the times when we are alone?<br />Or is her way of paying attention to the surroundings is shown by whispering?</p>
<p>However, just earlier it was confirmed that we were seen.<br />See, isn't Komatsu-kun glancing here? I also feel two girls' gazes on my back, I feel as if my limbs are getting tied. Oh school trip, please end faster.</p>
<p>Tachibana finally released my shoulders and sat near me.<br />It appears that she is in unusual happy mode. Showing her teeth, she grinned.</p>
<p>– As expected, you're good at taking care of others. Like going to help others in that situation.</p>
<p>– It's not like that. It's just that there was nothing to do after I started the fire for our group.</p>
<p>– If bookworm befriends Suguru and others, I could smoothly join too, right? In classroom or other places.</p>
<p>Thanks to listening to Tachibana, I now know that cool one is called Ogino Suguru, while noisy one is called Iidzuka Shouta. Apparently, they are the only members of the football club from our class.<br />... Somehow, today is full of new names.<br />I have confidence in forgetting them all tomorrow, seriously.</p>
<p>– So... if it turns out like that, wouldn't you triumph over the boys who badmouthed you?</p>
<p>– You still care about that? Just forget about it.</p>
<p>Clenching her fist, Tachibana pressed it onto my upper arm.<br />As if saying "<em>absolutely not</em>" she laughed - <em>Nihihi</em></p>
<p>But I... don't think that Okamura-kun and gang are especially bad or anything.<br />They are not worse nor better than others. I have my own problems too. It is true that I only study without a care about others, and it is natural that there will be people displeased by it.</p>
<p>A small conflict like that, I'm certain that it was not the first in our class.</p>
<p>Still, for some reason, this girl is strangely supporting me.<br />In that case, what makes her do it? I've been trying to guess it for a long time, but I still don't have anything resembling an answer.</p>
<p>Just because I help her with studies? Just that, really?<br />But apart from that, have I done anything?<br />Depending on the situation, there was enough possibility for Tachibana and her friends to hate me.</p>
<p>Haa...<br />Somehow, being with this girl, I am too occupied with being embarrassed, being melancholic or reading too much into things.</p>
<p>While we were idly spending time,</p>
<p>– Yo, merry couple.</p>
<p>Smoothly approaching us, was the football club pair from before.<br />Ogino, the cool one, kicked the ball in our direction and I received it semi-confused.</p>
<p>– ...Nice catch</p>
<p>– Hey, Ichijou-kun, let's play football! Komatsu-kun too!</p>
<p>Iidzuka, the noisy one, had an innocent look to him. Rather than a football player, he looks more like a baseball boy. Speech-wise, it sounds more like an invitation to baseball too.</p>
<p>Baffled, Komatsu-kun and I looked at each other.<br />Why us? Guessing what we wanted to say, Ogino shrugged his shoulders.</p>
<p>– Other guys went to play baseball. Besides, having two more is just right. As a... thanks for earlier?</p>
<p>– Playing football together as thanks? Haha, what's that...</p>
<p>Tachibana, who standing near me, poked my back and smiled as if saying "<em>You should just go!</em>"</p>
<p>Well... It's easier than having to chat with a girl like this...<br />It wasn't so bad that I would refuse to play. I didn't have anything to do anyway.</p>
<p>There was a big gravel field in this park. Looking around I could see people playing catch or kicking the ball like us, various types of games. Nevertheless, there is a sports ground at school, so they are doing the same thing as usual.<br />What was truly not usual, was that a pair of loners like us were about to play sports game during free time.</p>
<p>Two on two game.<br />Obviously, as the other party had two football club members, we mixed the teams.<br />Me and Ogino, Komatsu-kun and Iidzuka. It may be called football, but we just put cones to designate the goals.</p>
<p>Before the game started, Ogino, who was walking by, whispered</p>
<p>– Ichijou, you have to show Karen something good.</p>
<p><em>Haa</em>, I made a puzzled face. Isn't it just football. Ah.<br />Looking carefully, aren't that Tachibana and the other two standing at the edge of the field and looking here? I can see the complacent smile on the face of that blonde girl from here.</p>
<p>– ... Stop making weird misunderstandings. Let's quickly start.</p>
<p>– Come on, don't be angry. Didn't you two get along very well just now? Tell me what kind of interactions you have next time, okay?</p>
<p>– Oi, just play football. I'll go back if you don't stop.</p>
<p>– Sure, sure, lol</p>
<p>I just ran without thinking.<br />With intention of speeding up my digestion and forgetting about all troubles, I continued running for several tens of minutes.</p>
<p>It has to be said that both Komatsu-kun and I suck.<br />I can't decently run with the ball, so whenever I have it, the first thing I think of is giving pass in one touch. If I can receive the ball at a good position, I'll try to shoot. It's doesn't get inside though.</p>
<p>It was supposed to be like this...</p>
<p>– Bookworm, go for iiit!</p>
<p>Ugh, so annoying. Cheer the other guys!</p>
<p>However, while I was grumbling in my mind, I felt like my body got lighter.<br />I concentrated for once. I became unusually fired up.</p>
<p>Considering I couldn't do anything in the offense, I started running when the opponent had the ball.<br />And when Iidzuka made a shot and the ball was rolling towards the goal, I started running before even thinking.</p>
<p>Shit, make it! Make it!</p>
<p>Judging that I won't make it on time, I threw out my leg. I grandly threw my body on the gravel. I tried intercepting the ball with a slide, but the ball passed several centimeters away from my foot and went between the cones.</p>
<p>Haa... What am I trying so desperately for?<br />So foolish...</p>
<p>Lying on top of the dirty sand, I was only looking at the dark blue sky</p>
