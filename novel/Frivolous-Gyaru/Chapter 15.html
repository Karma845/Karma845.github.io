<h3>Chapter 15: Gathering Power, Awakening of the White Knight</h3>



<p> <br />They were enemies we could have defeated easily if our transformations hadn’t been undone.<br /> <br />But the opponents clearly used the same technology as us.<br /> <br />Not just us, Katsumi was also reverted to normal and driven into a corner, and we who were in an extremely dire crisis saw a scene of despair before our eyes.<br /> <br />“Gu, ugh, gaa!”<br /> <br />The silver belt equipped on Katsumi’s abdomen.<br /> <br />Accompanied by red electricity, it assaulted his body as if corroding it, making him cry out in agony.<br /> <br />“””Katsumi!!”””<br /> <br />Somehow still standing while writhing in pain, he looks at us and the girl.<br /> <br />Even with his face twisted in pain, strength dwelt in his eyes as he grit his teeth and desperately resisted.<br /> <br />“Katsumi, don’t! I hate it!!”<br /> <br />Seeing the black-haired girl called Alpha bound by the shining rope yet desperately trying to call out to him, he showed an incongruous serene smile for the situation.<br /> </p>

<p>“Katsu…mi.”<br /> <br />He closed his eyes.<br /> <br />He stopped writhing in pain and took a deep breath.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />‘ALL……DELE……TION……TION’<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Noise ran through the echoing voice, and the stagnant red electricity was sucked into the belt.<br /> <br />Instead, overflowing warm golden energy instantly covered his body.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />‘PERFECT!!’<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Together with that voice, solemn music unfitting for this place starts flowing. As if celebrating the birth of something, the powerful music makes not just us but the invaders also show confused expressions.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />‘ALL→ALL→ALL→ALMIGHTY!!!’<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Light envelops his body, and multiple armors are constructed and float in the air.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />‘THE ENEMY OF JUSTICE……’<br /> </p>



<p> <br />The armors equipped with metallic sounds.<br /> <br />However, the last three plates colored red, blue, and yellow slide and equip onto his chest belatedly.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />”’TRUTH FORM!!!’<br /> </p>



<p> <br />After multiple overlapping voices, he completes the transformation spewing smoke from his whole body, and his figure composed completely of white, the opposite of black.<br /> <br />Armor attached over the black bodysuit.<br /> <br />Three horns extending from his forehead upwards, and black lines representing tears engraved under the blue compound eyes.<br /> <br />The arm, shoulder, chest, and leg armor is thin, with red, blue, and yellow plates engraved on the right chest armor.<br /> <br />Seeing his figure giving an overall slender image, we could only be dumbfounded.<br /> <br />“…Magnificent! Oh, of course I believed you would properly equip it!”<br /> <br />Vega approaches clapping while he silently looks at his palm.<br /> <br />Did Katsumi get brainwashed…?<br /> <br />“I don’t wanna. I don’t want it…”<br /> <br />For him to become an enemy.<br /> <br />When we were having so much fun and laughing together just earlier…<br /> <br />“Katsumi…!”<br /> <br />About to cry, I reach out my hand.<br /> <br />He turns his mask here.<br /> <br />The will conveyed from the compound eyes that seem to be shedding tears wasn’t dead.<br /> <br />“Now you’ll be our comrade too!! To start, use those hands on your comrades–“<br /> <br />“Shut up.”<br /> <br />“Huh?”<br /> <br />“I said shut uuup!!”<br /> <br />The white warrior’s body is wrapped in light particles.<br /> <br />In an instant, with unbelievable motion he accelerates and his fist bares its fangs at the worst of the invaders.<br /> <br />“Wha-!? What the!?”<br /> <br />Punch for Vega detonated right before reaching them, blowing them away without a direct hit, but it was still an unexpected blow enough to stir their fear.<br /> <br />I still didn’t understand the situation, but I could grasp that developments were clearly different from the enemy’s intentions.<br /> <br />“What the… all of a sudden!?”<br /> <br />“I suspected it, but you’re perfectly compatible over here too!? What happened to the brainwashing!?”<br /> <br />Katsumi-kun, who had just transformed into a new form, looked bewildered rather than confident as he clenched his fist, checking his condition.<br /> <br />“I can’t get a grip on things all of a sudden… This Proto Suit is different.”<br /> <br />He wasn’t overwhelmed by power. Katsumi-kun remained himself.<br /> <br />Having received the alien transformation item on his body and still maintaining a strong sense of self, he glanced at Vega and Ax, who were still motionless, then tore apart the glowing ropes that bound the captured girl with his bare hands.<br /> <br />“Alpha, run.”<br /> <br />“Ka-Katsumi…”<br /> <br />“Run!! Have you forgotten our promise?”<br /> <br />“N-No! I said I’d stay with you! That’s why, I’ll stay close!”<br /> <br />“Go!!”<br /> <br />Alpha, as she was called, closed her eyes like a scolded child after Katsumi-kun’s stern words, then disappeared from the spot in an instant.<br /> <br />After watching her go, Katsumi-kun turned his gaze forward, cracking his knuckles as he headed towards Vega and the others.<br /> <br />“You’ve made me wear quite the strange outfits, invaders!”<br /> <br />“Why…! Unbelievable! You’re not brainwashed? It’s not something that should be broken by a lowly species like you!!”<br /> <br />Was Vega’s brainwashing ineffective on Katsumi-kun?<br /> <br />Though Vega was initially shocked by this fact, he quickly regained his composure.<br /> <br />“But even if you’ve transformed, it’s meaningless if we deactivate it from here. Ax.”<br /> <br />“Y-Yes, understood…”<br /> <br />Ax operated an arm terminal. He intended to forcibly deactivate the transformation, just like before…!?<br /> <br />“…!? It won’t deactivate!?”<br /> <br />“What’s going on!?”<br /> <br />“The energy output of the Dust Suit has been rewritten! The belt itself rejected our interference!”<br /> <br />Ax, panicking, was joined by Vega, who couldn’t hide his agitation.<br /> <br />“Did the Core reconfigure the system for the transformer!? That can’t be!!”<br /> <br />“Is this conversation over?”<br /> <br />A white warrior exuding an unmistakable aura of anger.<br /> <br />Vega and Ax turned pale at the illusion that seemed to twist the surrounding space due to his anger.<br /> <br />“So, is it okay to attack soon?”<br /> <br />The ground exploded as Katsumi-kun rushed towards Vega with incredible force.<br /> <br />Seeing his anger firsthand, the man and the scientist-like woman, now transformed into silver and gold warriors different from the ones we had fought, quickly activated their changers.<br /> <br />The gold warrior who transformed from Axe raised his hand towards Katsumi with a challenging look on his face.<br /> <br />“Gr-Gravity space, I’ll use it on this guy—”<br /> <br />“Shut up!!”<br /> <br />“Gwahh!?”<br /> <br />However, Katsumi-kun swiftly kicked him at an almost imperceptible speed and then lunged at Vega, who had donned a silver suit and armor.<br /> <br />Faster than the Proto Suit.<br /> <br />And his raw power was significantly enhanced.<br /> <br />“What the hell were you thinking, coming to Earth without permission!?”<br /> <br />“Shut up! You humans and your petty emotions! You think you can defeat me with that custom-made, star-class equipment specially enhanced for me!!”<br /> <br />As they fought, Vega’s suit gained additional armor, and more weapons were added.<br /> <br />Vega’s appearance transformed into something more like a giant covered in machinery than just armor.<br /> <br />“What… what is that thing?”<br /> <br />“What an ugly robot…”<br /> <br />A humanoid mass of machinery.<br /> <br />With the sound of engines and the release of electricity and steam, Vega, covered in armor and weapons, attacked Katsumi-kun.<br /> <br />“That outdated pile of junk, I’ll crush it!!”<br /> <br />A massive arm made of metal swung down at him.<br /> <br />Katsumi-kun effortlessly caught it with just his palm.<br /> <br />“Too light! Hey!!”<br /> <br />“Wha…!?”<br /> <br />The ground cracked from the impact, but Katsumi-kun himself showed no signs of strain.<br /> <br />In fact, he trembled with anger and casually tore off the mechanical arm with brute force.<br /> <br />“Quit messing around! That power is…!”<br /> <br />“You’re talking nonsense! You’re too damn noisy! Shut up!”<br /> <br />He struck Vega, who was encased in machinery.<br /> <br />The armor of the struck machine was torn off, and debris scattered.<br /> <br />“You’re spouting useless nonsense! You’re just a loudmouth!”<br /> <br />“Gah, ugh, damn it!?”<br /> <br />“And being needlessly durable pisses me off!!”<br /> <br />With these unreasonable words, he leaped onto Vega’s shoulder and ripped off the opposite arm. Before any additional reinforcements could be transferred, he continued his attack.<br /> <br />“My repairs can’t keep up!?”<br /> <br />His appearance was no different from when he had been a Black Knight, single-handedly defeating monsters.<br /> <br />“St-stop…”</p>

<p>“What do you mean it’s a game! A player! This guy acts like he’s something special, even though he came late to the party!”<br /> <br />“Gaaah!?”<br /> <br />He was tearing off the machine’s armor while continuing to strike…<br /> <br />The transfer of parts, most likely for repairs, couldn’t keep up anymore.<br /> <br />“Hmph!”<br /> <br />“Ugh, aaaaah!?”<br /> <br />After tossing the massive body using only his brute strength, he grabbed Vega’s legs mid-air.<br /> <br />Upon landing, he slammed Vega’s body into the ground, and then continued to pound him repeatedly.<br /> <br />Vega, who had bounced like a ragdoll, screamed in agony in a way that was unimaginable just a few minutes ago.<br /> <br />“Guah, aaaaaah! Uwaaaaah!?”<br /> <br />“But that’s not all!”<br /> <br />He threw Vega, who was spewing parts and blue blood through the gaps in his machinery, into the air. With a wide swing of his fist…<br /> <br />“I forgot, so I’ll jog your memory with punches!”<br /> <br />“Gyaaah!?”<br /> <br />He punched with all his might.<br /> <br />Vega was sent flying, creating craters in the ground as he soared several dozen meters.<br /> <br />The machine armor still seems intact, but conspicuous is only its sturdiness – its combat ability doesn’t hold a candle to the current Katsumi.<br /> <br />“Ah, he’s overwhelmingly strong…”<br /> <br />“That’s the alien’s equipment right…?”<br /> <br />“Probably…”<br /> <br />Red, Yellow and I could only stand there with our mouths agape, watching while holding our injured bodies.<br /> <br />As he tries to continue the pursuit, for some reason Katsumi stops and holds his forehead.<br /> <br />What? Don’t tell me they attacked Katsumi with something again…!?<br /> <br />“…Whoa, what a nice belt! Looks like it taught me how to use it directly to my head…!”<br /> <br />“Wh-what, no way…! There’s no such function…”<br /> <br />“If it taught me, I’ve got no choice but to use it…!”<br /> <br />Katsumi reaches for the belt buckle and pulls the side slider once.<br /> <br />Then the wolf-like thing the buckle was transformed from seems to howl in joy, echoing a roar.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[‘FLARE RED!!→OK?’]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />He lightly taps the button on the top part of the buckle again.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[‘CHANGE!!→TYPE RED!’]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />After the high tension electronic voice, all three color plates on his chest turn red, and red energy flows through the extending black lines centered on that part, filling his whole body.<br /> <br />Having gained the power of flames, he approaches Vega who is repairing himself with machinery as if simply walking over, cracking his knuckles.<br /> <br />“Take this!!”<br /> <br />What Vega fired was a shoulder cannon on his shoulder part and beam-like things attached to both arms.<br /> <br />The attacks that advanced melting and annihilating everything in their path all directly hit Katsumi, but looking at Katsumi’s power so far, that is…<br /> <br />“Th-the attacks aren’t working…!? A ridiculous level barrier…!!”<br /> <br />The attacks can’t even interfere with his steps, only getting deflected futilely.<br /> <br />Ignoring the attacks hitting him, he gets right up to Vega then forcefully slams his head into the ground with a grand swinging arm.<br /> <br />“Hmph!!”<br /> <br />“Gah, aah!?”<br /> <br />Sparks run all over Vega’s machine armor, malfunctioning from the blow powerful enough to form a crater.<br /> <br />After tapping the buckle three times, he points his palm at Vega.<br /> <br />“Welcome to Earth! I’ll give you a warm welcome!!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[‘DEADLY!! TYPE RED!!’]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[“No-, stop!!]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[‘FLARE EXPLOSION!!’]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Then, flame-shaped energy gathers focused on him, and after condensing it causes an explosion rising as high as the sky.<br /> <br />The blazing attack rising to the heavens brightly illuminates the surroundings despite it being daytime.<br /> <br />“Wo-, my color is amazi– what is this…?”<br /> <br />“Somehow, he’s just doing whatever he wants huh.”<br /> <br />“Akane, Kirara, your characters are going off the rails from the shock…”<br /> <br />All I could do was watch while dragging my hurting body, I was just dumbfounded.<br /> <br />His power as the white warrior, no, White Knight, far exceeded our imaginations.<br /> <br />“Come here!”<br /> <br />“Wha-!”<br /> <br />My shoulder is suddenly grabbed and something hard jabs my temple.<br /> <br />Is this the azurw one Katsumi took care of!? The azure one who held a gun to my head turns his attention to Katsumi shouting as he notices him.<br /> <br />“…You monster!! Undo your transformation this instant!! Or else this girl dies!!”<br /> <br />“No, Katsumi, don’t do as he says…”<br /> <br />At this rate I’ll get in his way.<br /> <br />So even if I have to throw away my life–<br /> <br />“If you let her go now, I’ll at least spare your life.”<br /> <br />“Huh? Are you making fun of me? I’ve obviously got the advantage with a hostage right!?”<br /> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />“…You-, don’t fuck with me!!<br /> <br />Hearing Katsumi’s extremely calm words, the gun held to my temple gets pointed at Katsumi instead.<br /> <br />A gun that melts anything.<br /> <br />Even seeing that up close, he doesn’t avert his gaze from me he’s holding hostage.<br /> <br />“Don’t worry. I won’t let you, Kirara, or Aoi get hurt.”<br /> <br />“Go dieeee!!”<br /> </p>







<p> <br />[‘CHANGE!!→TYPE BLUE!!’]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />In his terror, the azure warrior fires an energy shot directly at Katsumi, but it passes through his body and disappears behind him.<br /> <br />“Huh? Wh-why…”<br /> <br />His figure turned transparent blue like water then immediately returned to normal as he operates the buckle again, cloaking himself in yellow power.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[‘CHANGE!!→TYPE YELLOW!!’ ]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />A flash.<br /> <br />Realizing the situation in the next moment, I’m being carried in Katsumi’s arms.<br /> <br />Not understanding the circumstances, looking where I just was, the blue warrior already lied dead with a hole in the vital part of his chest.<br /> <br />“Sorry for worrying you. My bad.”<br /> <br />“You’re Katsumi…right?”<br /> <br />“Yeah, I don’t really get it but I’m not brainwashed and my life hasn’t been sucked either.”<br /> <br />I’m glad…but as expected, you’re off the charts huh.<br /> <br />Still carried, I get set down near Kirara and Aoi.<br /> <br />“Now then, what’s left is…”<br /> <br />“Haa…haa…haa…!”<br /> <br />“…How stubborn, you were still alive?”<br /> <br />Vega in half-destroyed form crawls out of the crater as Katsumi turns around.<br /> <br />The machine armor he wore is almost completely destroyed, he looks half-dead, but even so tremendous hatred dwells in his eyes.<br /> <br />“Don’t…regret it…you ape…!”<br /> <br />“If we’re apes, then you guys are filthy hyenas. Don’t act like the boss of the mountain with that level of power.”<br /> <br />“…!”<br /> <br />Scattering parts with a clanking sound, he brings his remaining arm to the Changer left on it.<br /> <br />“Tra…nsfer me to the ship…! I’ll kill you on the spaceship…!”<br /> <br />“Try it if you can!!”<br /> <br />Still going off momentum, he pulls the buckle slider a fourth time.<br /> <br />After red, blue, yellow, the fourth!? What kind of enhancement awaits next!?<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[‘THE ALMIGHTY!!→OK?’]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“…………”<br /> <br />Hesitating to tap the buckle with the verified layered voices different from the rest.<br /> <br />An unnatural silence visits.<br /> <br />After a few seconds of short silence, he relaxes his shoulders.<br /> <br />“This power is something I got from you guys.”<br /> <br />“Huh?”<br /> <br />“I can finally move forward. I who was just the Black Knight only fighting…<br /> <br />You guys made me human. Thank you…those are the only words that come to mind.”<br /> <br />“Wait a minute.”<br /> <br />Suddenly speaking quietly, Red, Yellow and I notice something off.<br /> <br />“Why say that kind of…thing now? Stop it…”<br /> <br />“Because now’s the only time I can say it.”<br /> <br />“You can tell us anytime after!! Because we’ll go home together right!? Katsumi!!”<br /> <br />I cling to his arm without thinking, but he gently shakes me off.<br /> <br />“I’m counting on you for the rest, Akane.”<br /> <br />“No-!!”<br /> </p>



<p> <br />[‘CHANGE!!→TYPE……’]<br /> </p>



<p>[‘UNIVERSE!!’]<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Saying that without turning this way, he taps the buckle and heads wrapped in golden light towards Vega who is being swallowed by light.<br /> <br />Katsumi gets wrapped in a pillar of light and sucked into the chest of the robot standing far away.<br /> <br />“When you come back…tell me…! Why say it like a final farewell…!!”<br /> <br />I break down crying right there where he disappeared.<br /> <br />He boarded the spaceship with Vega.<br /> <br />There, he’s fighting a great number of enemies now.<br /> <br />“Akane, look…”<br /> <br />Looking where Aoi points, abnormality can be seen in the robot standing in the city.<br /> <br />As if exploding from inside, part of its chest is destroyed, and the exposed interior is continuously causing explosions with the leaking golden light.<br /> <br />‘OOOHH!!’<br /> <br />I can hear his voice.<br /> <br />The voice of him exerting himself to save this planet.<br /> <br />Right after that, a great explosion occurs at the center of the chest and power leaves the robot’s body, causing a large crack to open in the space before it.<br /> <br />I realize it’s the wormhole they used to come here.<br /> <br />The robot loses function and disappears into the wormhole collapsing forward.<br /> <br />Katsumi didn’t come back.<br /> <br />All that was left were the ‘Proto Changer’ he used and the solitary cell overflowing with his belongings until today.</p>
