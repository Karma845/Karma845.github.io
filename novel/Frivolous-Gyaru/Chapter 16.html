<h3>Chapter 16: Justice</h3>


<p>Alpha and Omega.<br /> <br />It refers to two individuals, male and female, that awaken due to a special factor embedded in the beings that live on the stars.<br /> <br />Alpha awakens with the ability to influence everything.<br /> <br />Omega tends to awaken with the ability to influence individuals, and we make the living beings of the stars engage in “mutual consumption” for a purpose.<br /> <br />Those with the Omega factor are ferocious.<br /> <br />Acting on instinct, they become a threat that devours the beings of that star.<br /> <br />By utilizing that habit, we maximize the power of Omega to the point where they finally gain the qualification to cross spears with us.<br /> <br />If the power of Omega is great, then secure it.<br /> <br />If it is weak, dispose of it, initialize that star once again, administer the factors of Alpha and Omega, and wait for the next harvest.<br /> <br />Our organization, the “Savers”, had been hunting lower ranked stars in that way.<br /> <br />I thought it was easy, an invasion.<br /> <br />I decided to secretly obtain the intellectual living beings of the planet called Earth, ignoring previous orders.<br /> <br />A weak planet, with a low level of civilization.<br /> <br />I assumed that neither the Alpha nor Omega born there would be significant existences.<br /> <br />In fact, when we scanned the planet, the original Omega had been defeated and destroyed by humans.</p>



<p>It should have been easy to rule even these kinds of living beings.<br /> <br />Although the Alpha and Omega of that planet were already dead, the Alpha had given birth to a child and created a new Alpha, an unusual situation.<br /> <br />It was an abnormal individual that far surpassed the power of its parent, and was skilled at exceptionally powerful mental interference against the same humans.<br /> <br />It was enough to deceive even us, an alien race. It could potentially deceive other colleagues as well – it was nothing but advantages.<br /> <br />If we could capture even the Alpha, we should be able to obtain more convenient slaves.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />Why did it turn out like this?<br /> <br />I intended to descend upon the Earth, secure the abnormal Alpha individual, and in passing, enjoy playing with the current living beings of Earth.<br /> <br />Surprisingly, although the suits worn by the Earthlings did excel our own, the specs themselves were similar to the enhanced suits circulating in the organization we belong to, so dealing with them by forcibly removing their transformations was easy.<br /> <br />The miscalculation was the single Earthling who acted together with the Alpha.<br /> <br />We were driven into a predicament by an impostor with no Omega factor, merely chosen.<br /> <br />The guy who had the Curse Belt, Dust Driver, which consumes the wearer’s life and brings destruction to all things attached to him should have become our puppet.<br /> <br />But that didn’t happen. Instead, the Dust Driver was completely obedient to him and bared his fangs at me.<br /> <br />With our state-of-the-art enhanced suits, weapons, and additional armor, we were overwhelmed without being able to counterattack and I had no choice but to resort to subjugating the ground with the Savers’ interstellar combat spacecraft as a last measure.<br /> <br />“Haa, haa…”<br /> <br />Transferring to the ship interior, I repair my damaged limbs while activating the attack system of the warship.<br /> <br />“He’ll come here soon. Come on, come!! The moment he does I’ll blow him to pieces with the laser…”<br /> <br />In that instant, a tremendous impact runs through the warship.<br /> <br />With the room containing the transfer device shaking violently from the unbelievable impact, the sounds of destruction continue to echo.<br /> <br />‘You think that level of fist is getting through?!’<br /> <br />“?!?”<br /> <br />Realizing it was an attack by that guy who had transformed into a golden figure, I forgot the hostility and hatred I had been harboring just moments ago. I urgently performed a wormhole transfer of the warship itself and withdrew from Earth.<br /> <br />“Escaping from Earth, he’ll be alone! Even if he tries to destroy this ship, there are other fleets here besides us!!”<br /> <br />I have to admit it.<br /> <br />He is not an existence I can handle.<br /> <br />I have to kill him by borrowing the hands of the higher-ranked in this universe if it comes down to it.<br /> <br />“Before that, I need to hurry and complete repairs–“<br /> <br />‘Oraa!!’<br /> <br />The moment repairs to my lower half finished, the wall of the control room I was in was blown away and a golden light rushed in.<br /> <br />Appearing shrouded in white smoke, his figure changed from gold to white as he glared at me.<br /> <br />“Haa, haa…”<br /> <br />“Hih”<br /> <br />My newly connected legs unconsciously back away from the fearsome hostility.<br /> <br />“You bastard, I won’t let you escape!”<br /> <br />“Hih, hii!?”<br /> <br />Turning my back without an ounce of resistance, I flee from him giving chase.<br /> <br />I activate all the intercept systems within the ship in an attempt to restrain him, but they are all rendered meaningless and destroyed.<br /> <br />“Wha, what is he…”<br /> <br />My legs that should have been repaired feel like they’ll break any second.<br /> <br />Why is there no sign of exhaustion or consumption despite the destruction he’s caused?<br /> <br />“An intruder!?”<br /> <br />“Lord Vega!? What is the meaning of this!!”<br /> <br />“Tha, that’s a hostile force!! Kill him!!”<br /> <br />I use the crew members who noticed the threat within the ship as meat shields.<br /> <br />They’re nobodies picked up on some planet or other anyway, as long as I survive that’s all that matters!!<br /> <br />“You bastards, hey!! Get out of the way!!”<br /> <br />“Gyeh!?”<br /> <br />“Every one of them are aliens, this guy!!”<br /> <br />“Gueh!?”<br /> <br />“No, to you guys, even I’m an alien!!”<br /> <br />“Gyaa!?”<br /> <br />Damn, they’re not even slowing him down…!!<br /> <br />A chill and trembling won’t stop in this mechanized body that’s forgotten even fear.<br /> <br />The guy shrouded in golden light destroys the soldiers around him just by moving.<br /> <br />“This spaceship has already transferred to outer space!! There’s no place left for you to return to!”<br /> <br />“Shaddup!! I’ll destroy this whole spaceship along with you bastards even if it means dying together!!”<br /> <br />“Nhih”<br /> <br />Just imagining something so frightening being said makes me shudder.<br /> <br />This is bad.<br /> <br />The place we wormholed to is headquarters where “that person” is.<br /> <br />An explosion or anything happening in a place like that would bring down a punishment more horrifying than death.<br /> <br />“Gotcha…!!”<br /> <br />“Oh no–“<br /> <br />Paralyzed for an instant in fear, an opportunity was taken and my body was seized.<br /> <br />As he raises his fist to destroy me,<br /> <br />“Is this the end!?”<br /> <br />darkness envelops me and him grabbing me.<br /> <br />Thud, just my upper body falls to the ground.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Huh? Where is this place?”<br /> <br />Before I realized it, the area around had completely changed from inside the ship to another location. Different from the ship interior I was just in, it was a vast space with stars glittering fantastically like I was in outer space. While distracted by the mystical scenery, I realize the hard floor I’ve collapsed on top of.<br /> <br />“Huh?”<br /> <br />Someone is sitting on a throne with starlight streaming down, their knees together.<br /> <br />“Wha, that’s…!”<br /> <br />Could it be I was transferred inside the fleet in an instant…!?<br /> <br />The one sitting on the throne stands up.<br /> <br />The one who approached with clear footsteps was a woman with blue skin.<br /> <br />“……”<br /> <br />With long, dark blue hair, and jet black pupils so beautiful it makes you want to prostrate yourself before her.<br /> <br />The moment I saw her with a white cloth draped over her right shoulder like a dress, I couldn’t stop shaking in fear.<br /> <br />“No doubt about it…”<br /> <br />Although it’s my first time seeing her, just the sight of her form makes me certain.<br /> <br />“Another alien?”<br /> <br /></p>

<p>‘Oh my, it seems an interesting life form has slipped into this ship.’<br /> <br />“….?”<br /> <br />Her words don’t reach the Earthling.<br /> <br />As he tilts his head, she creates a wormhole in front of her and takes a book out from there.<br /> <br />In just a few seconds she flips through it, immediately closing and tossing the book back into the wormhole where it’s stored, and lets out a light sigh.<br /> <br />“The language of Earth. How simple.”<br /> <br />“Uh…”<br /> <br />“Is this understandable?”<br /> <br />“O-okay…”<br /> <br />Looking dumbfounded, as he nods she sits down on the steps leading up to the throne, looking satisfied.<br /> <br />“Well done coming here, intruder. I’m bored, you see.”<br /> <br />“You the next enemy?”<br /> <br />“That’s right. Come at me if you have the courage. I welcome you to try.”<br /> <br />At that moment, my body is smashed into the ground with a crunch.<br /> <br />I realize while desperately maintaining consciousness that this is due to the overwhelming pressure of her presence, not being crushed by something invisible.<br /> <br />“Urgh…”<br /> <br />Without using any abilities, just the overwhelming sense of existence.<br /> <br />Killing intent and pressure take form, assaulting my whole body and pinning me to the ground.<br /> <br />“Huh? What’s wrong with you?”<br /> <br />How, how can he stand there!?<br /> <br />He doesn’t feel anything from this pressure!?<br /> <br />“Oh, you’re standing?”<br /> <br />“Did you do something?”<br /> <br />“…Shall we find out if you attack me?”<br /> <br />Following her words, showing overflowing hostility, he rushed out as if he knew nothing.<br /> </p>



<p> <br />‘CHANGE! → TYPE UNIVERSE!!’<br /> </p>



<p> <br />“Haa!!”<br /> <br />Seeing him jump and raise his fist, his whole body dyed gold, she raised the corner of her lips.<br /> <br />His fist heads towards her.<br /> <br />Letting out a silent scream, his fist is blocked right before touching her, as if by an invisible wall.<br /> <br />“Tch!!”<br /> <br />“Magnificent.”<br /> <br />His body bounces off, echoing a roar that shakes space itself.<br /> <br />As he lands, she stands up and faces him.<br /> <br />“I’ve changed my mind. Let me hear your name. Earth warrior.”<br /> <br />“First you tell me your name, bastard!”<br /> <br />That earth monkey–!! How dare he speak like that!!<br /> <br />Unable to move this paralyzed body, I curse and desperately wish for him to be gruesomely killed by her.<br /> <br />But she warps her cheeks in amusement at the rudeness.<br /> <br />“That’s true. If we are to get along for a long time, I must tell you my name.”<br /> <br />Looking as if she doesn’t understand the words “long time”, she places a hand on her chest as she looks at him.<br /> <br />“My name is Ruin. What do you think? I’ve given my name, haven’t I?”<br /> <br />“…Katsumi.”<br /> <br />“Katsumi, is it.”<br /> <br />As if infatuated, looking as if she had found unparalleled enjoyment, she snapped her fingers with a delighted expression.<br /> <br />“I’ll take your measure. Katsumi, whether or not you can be my enemy.”<br /> <br />“Tch.”</p>





<p><br /> <br />In an instant, a spherical space like a starry sky swallows her and him with her at the center.<br /> <br />“Wha, what is this…?”<br /> <br />The one and the Earthling vanish in an instant.<br /> <br />But in just a few seconds, the spherical space disappears.<br /> <br />“Gah!?”<br /> <br />The Earthling wearing the Dust Driver crashes to the ground, his whole body covered in blood.<br /> <br />“Even though she effortlessly beat me to a pulp, he one-sidedly…”<br /> <br />His suit is cracked, and his bare face exposed from the broken mask.<br /> <br />Next to the man collapsed in a pool of blood, “that person” stands with her right hand dyed red.<br /> <br />“Converted to Earth time, 56 hours, 34 minutes, 57 seconds.”<br /> <br />“Guah…!”<br /> <br />Is she going for the kill…!?<br /> <br />Waiting expectantly for the situation to unfold, she picks up the man she was looking down on in both hands.<br /> <br />“I’ve finally, finally found you… Katsumi, it was you.”<br /> <br />“Tch!?”<br /> <br />Not minding her white garb being stained by the filthy red blood, she embraces him.<br /> <br />That embrace even seems merciful.<br /> <br />Yet he doesn’t lose his hostility, raising his fist.<br /> <br />“Enough, it would be a waste for you to die here.”<br /> <br />Meeting her eyes, he becomes unable to move as if bound by something.<br /> <br />“I won’t… let you… kill me here. I can still… fight…”<br /> <br />“I won’t allow you to die here. Katsumi, you must live. For my sake.”<br /> <br />Unable to properly get his words out, he leaks out a disjointed voice. She lays him on his side with his head resting on her lap, chuckling cheerfully.<br /> <br />“I enjoyed myself. For you to make me move from that spot, even go as far as attack… There aren’t many in the stellar ranking who could do that…”<br /> <br />The abnormal scene unfolding between the thrones makes my head spin as if I’m going crazy.<br /> <br />Is this a nightmare?<br /> <br />I don’t understand.<br /> <br />That guy who made me taste bitterness, and her…!!<br /> <br />“Excellent physical aqueous alteration too. But it seems you didn’t comprehend techniques resembling existence fixation… That’s a bit disappointing. Your speed and power are passing marks, but your crisis perception, prediction based on experience, are quite something.”<br /> <br />“Sh… shut…”<br /> <br />“But the end was good. Very, very good. Violence by fist. Perfect violence. While that was an attack I should have properly received head-on… I thought it would be rude to you, so I had you smash me directly.”<br /> <br />She tears off his mask like ripping it off by hand, then strokes his exposed hair.<br /> <br />Fragments roll on the ground with a clatter.<br /> <br />“But full points. Magnificent. They’ll say I’m being too lenient with the grading, but this is something I won’t concede. More than anything, coming at me head-on gets +100 points. Really magnificent…”<br /> <br />“Guh…”<br /> <br />“However, not reckless. You must have aptitude. And experience too. What you lack is numbers? Comrades? Equipment? Fufu, you lack all kinds of things.”<br /> <br />Even after being shown overwhelming power, he still tries to show resistance.<br /> <br />“Don’t glare. Don’t glare. What a stubborn guy even on death’s door, if you look at me with such eyes it makes me love you more…”<br /> <br />Smiling, she touches his cheek.<br /> <br />“I could raise you to my preferences like this. But no. That’s not it. Just that wouldn’t be fun.”<br /> <br />She points her hand at the space in front of her.<br /> <br />A wormhole connected somewhere.<br /> <br />After checking the scene on the other side, she grasps his collar and lifts him up.<br /> <br />“I’ll return you to Earth.”<br /> <br />She points at him held up before the wormhole.<br /> <br />“If you can withstand one blow from me.”<br /> <br />In that moment, an invisible impact of some kind seems to smash into his torso still wearing the suit.<br /> <br />The blood spewed out stains her smiling cheeks, and he disappears into the depths of the wormhole just like that.<br /> <br />With the blood stuck to her cheeks in her mouth, she laughs merrily.<br /> <br />“Fufufu, let’s cancel the initialization of Earth. I’ve become interested in that planet.”<br /> <br />Her gaze turned toward me collapsed on the ground shifts, as if she’s just now noticed my existence.<br /> <br />She makes a surprised expression, then heaves a sigh.<br /> <br />“Stellar ranking 335th Vega identification faction ‘Savers’.”<br /> <br />“P-please wait…! I can still be of use!!”<br /> <br />“Strength itself is the reason of this world.”<br /> <br />Her fingertip points this way.<br /> <br />“The defeated have no need for the name of justice.”<br /> <br />My vision blurs.<br /> <br />While tormented by the sensation of my body being torn to pieces, I faintly hear her voice.<br /> <br />“The place we gather has no name. Strength itself is the justice that forms us.”</p>

<p>[Chat] Thread about Black Knight-kun 5</p>


<p>TOP ALL – &lt;100 100&gt;&gt; NEW 50</p>
<p>121: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Video was released, and some crazy stuff came out.</p>
<p>Was this filmed by Red and the others’ transformation items and drones?</p>
<p>Their appearances are obscured by edits and processing, but… To think this was happening.</p>
<p>122: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />First monsters, now aliens?! Don’t mess with me. And they seem fully intent on invading too.</p>
<p>123: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun….</p>
<p>124: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />No way…!</p>
<p>125: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He protected the Earth…</p>
<p>126: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />No one will speak ill of Black Knight-kun anymore, so please come back.</p>
<p>127: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun’s spirit will be carried on by Justice Crusader…</p>
<p>128: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Do you guys really think Black Knight-kun would die from that level of thing?</p>
<p>129: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I sobered up in an instant. That’s right, there’s no way he’d die. It’s Black Knight-kun we’re talking about.</p>
<p>130: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He’s no mere lifeform who would kick the bucket from getting sucked into some wormhole.</p>
<p>131: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Yes yes, enough with the superficial condolences.</p>
<p>132: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Take this backhand!</p>
<p>133: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It’s because his usual conduct is too extreme.</p>
<p>134: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />What Black Knight-kun did this time:</p>
<p>-Instantly neutralized 3 invading enemies in Protosuit state</p>
<p>-Destroyed 2 entirely</p>
<p>-Forced out of transformation by enemy cheat, in pinch</p>
<p>Subjugated mysterious transformation item and transformed</p>
<p>Beat the hell out of invader, boarded giant robot alone and destroyed it for payback</p>
<p>He likely then charged into the enemy base. Still not back yet.</p>
<p>135: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Yup, it’s the usual Black Knight-kun. (Stupefied)</p>
<p>136: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Justice Crusader tried hard too.</p>
<p>It’s just the enemy was cocky, then forced them out of transformation when they were about to lose.</p>
<p>Forced transformation isn’t unfair.</p>
<p>The problem is fighting like a game from the start instead of doing that from the beginning. That’s infuriating.</p>
<p>137: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />But really, how would Black Knight-kun die? (Innocent)</p>
<p>138: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />His expression was mosaiced and blacked out, but Black Knight-kun really was a child.</p>
<p>And because of that the enemy managed to do something terrible to him…</p>
<p>139: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Something terrible (No exaggeration)</p>
<p>140: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />With a development of forced transformation and brainwashing, how does it become that?</p>
<p>141: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The transformation belt is obviously alien-made lol</p>
<p>Did they gift it to Black Knight-kun?</p>
<p>142: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Never thought Protosuit-chan would get Black Knight-kun snatched away.</p>
<p>143: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />A rival inorganic heroine, Dust Driver-chan, has appeared!</p>
<p>144: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The abnormal situation where Dust Driver-chan is already anthropomorphized and illustrated.</p>
<p>It hasn’t even been a week since the announcement right?</p>
<p>145: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />That Dust Driver the aliens mentioned is probably the same type as Protosuit-chan right?</p>
<p>Parts were censored with beeps, but I can make out they tried to brainwash Black Knight-kun using it right?</p>
<p>146: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Normally this would be an agonizing situation where he’d rampage or get hypnotized and kill each other with Justice Crusader after forced transformation.</p>
<p>That’s if Black Knight-kun was a normal human.</p>
<p>147: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He got the alien belt put on him!!<br />↓<br />Nothing really happened and he just transformed perfectly after fully adapting!!</p>
<p>What is going on…</p>
<p>148: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He seemed in pain for a moment, but adapted and transformed instantly. Black Knight-kun really is something huh.</p>
<p>Does he emit some kind of wave that makes inorganic things like him?</p>
<p>149: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Hearing he’s actually an alien feels convincing rather than surprising.</p>
<p>150: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />He’s a natural-born perfect match from Earth!</p>
<p>151: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Stop saying all Earthlings are like Black Knight-kun!!</p>
<p>152: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The transformation sound and abilities are way too crazy lol</p>
<p>153: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It’s awful how fast Dust Suit-chan fell from being a sacred maiden.</p>
<p>154: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />PERFECT!! (Love it!!)<br />Or was that just my imagination? It sounded that way to me.</p>
<p>155: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Anyone would hear it that way.</p>
<p>156: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun, who captured even the unassailable Protosuit-chan. No matter what alien suit, it’ll quickly submit to Black Knight-kun.</p>
<p>157: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />You’re right, but that analogy is too much!</p>
<p>158: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />The Dust Suit name itself is questionable.</p>
<p>It probably means it either ruins the life of the user, or is trash-like.</p>
<p>Most likely it was a sorting or execution tool.</p>
<p>From their speech, it seems no one has worn it before, so they tried it on Black Knight-kun who has the similarly dangerous Protosuit equipped.</p>
<p>159: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />It also seems to have some will, so perhaps it was waiting for the chance to equip someone while sharpening its fangs.</p>
<p>It just hadn’t found a suitable wearer until now.</p>
<p>160: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Aren’t those invaders stupid?</p>
<p>Just bring a ship and brainwash normally. Giving random power-up items is idiotic.</p>
<p>161: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Changing the transformation sound partway and making new standby audio means this is probably something that hadn’t existed until now.</p>
<p>The invaders’ confusion made that clear.</p>
<p>162: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />From the solemn standby audio to the finale…</p>
<p>Black Knight-kun became White Knight-kun huh.</p>
<p>163: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />I was also surprised he thoroughly beat the hell out of the invader leader.</p>
<p>164: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />That guy is an arrogant alien.</p>
<p>Relies completely on his equipment’s performance and has zero combat experience.</p>
<p>165: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Black Knight-kun and Justice Crusader are veterans honed through actual battle experience.</p>
<p>There are even suspicions Black Knight-kun could have won normally in Protosuit form.</p>
<p>166: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Realizing the enemy is a ridiculous bastard loosened my chest.</p>
<p>Don’t fuck with us, this is reality not some game.</p>
<p>167: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />They’re cosmic hyenas.</p>
<p>From their declarations, they seem to be latecomers to the monster incidents.</p>
<p>168: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />Who do they think they are saying they’ll take control?</p>





<p>169: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
According to scholars and experts on them,</p>
<p>The invaders used monsters to make them do sinister things.</p>
<p>Then they would appear and the fight would bring honor if they won.</p>
<p>This strengthens mighty creatures to their side.</p>
<p>They would then enslave the beings of conquered planets…</p>
<p>Supposedly.</p>
<p>170: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Their arrogance while pretending to be justice is infuriating.</p>
<p>171: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Adding on,</p>
<p>The monster incidents seem to stem entirely from the invaders.</p>
<p>Once monsters grew on Earth, the game would begin.</p>
<p>Well, there was a bug character in that game. (Delight)</p>
<p>172: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Looking from the side, they truly are painful fellows.</p>
<p>And the monsters, the so-called outsiders, were defeated by Justice Crusader and Black Knight-kun who fought them. Yet these guys come afterwards prancing arrogantly.</p>
<p>173: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Got pretty long-winded huh.</p>
<p>174: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
I think the ridiculous thing about them is the colors!!</p>
<p>Just looking like special effects show monsters!!</p>
<p>Gold, silver, purple, cyan, green, what the hell!!</p>
<p>Screw you, at least balance the colors!!</p>
<p>It’s like they chose whatever colors they personally liked without considering balance!!</p>
<p>But White Knight-kun is a super best match, so he’s forgiven!</p>
<p>175: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
And when they’re about to lose, those guys force transformation cancellation.</p>
<p>That’s how Black Knight-kun and Justice Crusader were defeated too.</p>
<p>176: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
&gt;&gt;174<br />
I thought she was a special effects sis, but she fell hard and fast lol</p>
<p>177: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Without that, Justice Crusader could have won alone I bet.</p>
<p>Their final weapon isn’t just strong, it’s egregious.</p>
<p>Black Knight-kun destroyed 2 in an instant, so their ability itself isn’t much.</p>
<p>178: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Hunting mood coming to Earth, then cheating when they might lose. Utterly ridiculous.</p>
<p>179: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Justice Crusader had them cornered in under a minute, they would have normally won.</p>
<p>180: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Without transformation, Black Knight-kun is just a powerless human.</p>
<p>Well, that was a sort of human appeal!</p>
<p>181: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
The result came from foolish aliens arrogantly doing something foolish to someone they shouldn’t have touched.</p>
<p>182: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Thought it was a loss event, but a power-up event huh. Unexpected.</p>
<p>183: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Is it really okay for the new form to be a gift from the enemy?</p>
<p>184: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Can’t conceal the hostility towards justice anymore…</p>
<p>185: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
“Enemy of justice” has connotations of evil faking justice, not Justice Crusader’s justice.</p>
<p>It’s clear from appearance too.</p>
<p>After all, each Justice Crusader color is incorporated into their suits.</p>
<p>186: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
It means Red and the others could change Black Knight-kun.</p>
<p>The abilities were also based on Red and their colors…</p>
<p>187: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
The 4th stage is UNIVERSE.</p>
<p>If the commercial toy voices are right, it handles Justice Crusader last huh…</p>
<p>So emotional.</p>
<p>188: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
It really was the ultimate friendship form.</p>
<p>189: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Type Red: Energy Barrier, Power Up<br />
Type Yellow: Speed Up<br />
Type Blue: Gelatinous</p>
<p>Hey wait a minute!</p>
<p>One is clearly out of place!!</p>
<p>190: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Nooo!!</p>
<p>191: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Gelatinous is the worst ability to get! Lol</p>
<p>192: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
The already strong guy shouldn’t get the strongest form!</p>
<p>193: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Well, Blue definitely didn’t become gelatinous.</p>
<p>194: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Blue’s personality has a gelatinous-like unpredictable feel (?)</p>
<p>195: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Looking at it like this, Blue is pretty normal too.</p>
<p>Black Knight-kun said the same.</p>
<p>196: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
It was obvious after transforming.</p>
<p>The Dust Suit delightedly lending power lol</p>
<p>Explaining how to use the abilities diligently like a loyal dog.</p>
<p>197: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
White Knight-kun was already overwhelming before unleashing his power, then he started demolishing.</p>
<p>198: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Mixing hard, fast, invincible, and strong is weird.</p>
<p>199: Hero and Anonymous-san<br />
Protosuit: “…… (&gt;_&lt;)”   200: Hero and Anonymous-san Because it cherry picked the good parts…   Gelatinous is questionable, but the other two are also way too strong.   201: Hero and Anonymous-san Black Knight-kun! Protosuit-chan is crying now!   Good! Keep at it more! (Sudden change)   202: Hero and Anonymous-san I want Black Knight-kun to come back soon.   203: Hero and Anonymous-san I hope he can live a life unrelated to fighting, even if not in the public eye.   204: Hero and Anonymous-san That would have happened if the aliens didn’t come.   Thinking that, I don’t want him to fight anymore.   205: Hero and Anonymous-san Everyone’s waiting.</p>
