<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211;  Dangerous Youth Study of Ichijou Family</h3>

<p>According to my, Ichijou Jun's, and my sister's acting guardian aunt Arika's theory, generally, adolescent conflicts in first semester of second year of high school are terrific.</p>
<p>Er, what is this person saying? Naturally, I asked for an explanation. As a result, aunt shined with her big round eyeglasses, and during breakfast answered me this in a super high tension manner:</p>
<p>– Come on, Jun-kun. What are you being so sloppy for? Second year of high school is given to boys for them to flourish! That is absolutely indispensable! You will never have a chance to smoothly raising a flag with a girl after this period! Fu-fu!</p>
<p>– Haaa...</p>
<p>– Jun-kun, don't you have a girl you like? Summer vacation is getting closer, you know? Yeah, you have to make some meticulous preparations. 「Virginity graduation during summer holiday of second year of high school』is one of the win conditions in a game called high school life.</p>
<p>Aunt Arika was a little hysteric right from the morning. Having romcom shoujo manga artist as an occupation being the likely reason, whenever deadline is close she gets really nervous. Of course I understand that there is a need to consider her situation, so I decided to properly match our speeches, just like always.</p>
<p>Yeah, just like always.</p>
<p>It means that I, actually told my aunt many little lies.</p>
<p>Little lies like me having three friends who always play in this house after school.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is due to occupation too, but aunt always annoys with her speeches on youth or living in the moment. 『God of Youth will punish those who skip school festivals』or『In the world of Youth, loners are sinners』. All that ambiguous stuff is my aunt's doctrine.</p>
<p>For some reason, our Founder of the Youth Sect Arika, despite being one, is excessively strict. Not that I'm against it. In fact, I don't want her to know that I am a loner and worry her.</p>
<p>– I understand. Then from today onward I will do my best, and surprise aunt this summer.</p>
<p>– Good! It's OK to just bring someone home! You can do your naughty things, while I will pretend I didn't see anything. I will pretend to not see anything and get some material for my new work!</p>
<p>– No, doesn't that mean you will be staring while pretending not to see?</p>
<p>– Ufufu... Exposed?</p>
<p>I mean, wasn't that your intention from the beginning?</p>
<p>You have to eat breakfast, eat vegetables as much as you eat meat. That being aunt's policy, compared to lunch, breakfast in our home is more splendid. There are heaps of sweet-and-sour pork on the dish in the center of the dining table, but if you are negligent and don't eat any vegetables, they will be forcibly put on your plate. You can't be negligent with vegetables.</p>
<p>Probably anticipating such a situation, the one sitting on the side playing with the lettuce interrupted the conversation.</p>
<p>– That's impossible aunt Arika. In case of aniki, it's impossible.</p>
<p>Little girl, who has big round eyeglasses similar to aunt's, giggled.</p>
<p>She is Ichijou Keyaki.</p>
<p>She is my little sister and unfettered shut-in who behaves like a cat around people. It's almost 8 o'clock, but she still hasn't changed out of her pajamas. She is supposed to be a third grade middle school student, but it seems today, she isn't planning on going to school again.</p>
<p>– Has this person ever brought a girl on a day off?</p>
<p>– Oh, now that you mention it...</p>
<p>– He either studies earnestly or plays games with me.</p>
<p>– It will change soon. Watch me from now on.</p>
<p>– Have you brought anyone apart from your male friends? Admit it.</p>
<p>Keyaki grinned mischievously while playing with her fine black hair. She is certainly a shut-in, but ... she is so irritatingly perceptive. Also, she probably sees through that I am a loner.</p>
<p>– It's fine to stay this week with me too. Who's gonna care for me if you stop being loner, aniki?</p>
<p>– Keyaki-chan. Stop pampering your brother. He will really become a loner, you know?</p>
<p>Oh, shut up, don't underestimate me. I am one already.</p>
<p>Well, as a matter of fact, I don't mind being a loner. Of course I respect my aunt's point of view, however I'm too used to gloomy lifestyle to actually do what she suggests. Still, I haven't once retorted during times like this. Even if I did try argue on this, my logic would still end up being crushed by power. In the end, being good boy is the number one choice.</p>
<p>Besides, it is often during times like this that romcom protagonists start having useless confrontations with others and end up joining some weird clubs full of beautiful girls. I am so well-informed on that. But what if a real loner was thrown into a group of beautiful girls? I get creeps just imagining it.</p>
<p>To start with, there's no chance for a decent conversation. The moment loner makes an eye contact with a girl, all the words will get stuck in the throat, as if he is surrounded by basilisks. If we speak in terms of wanting to run away in fear, it's already on the level of zombie films.</p>
<p>"Beautiful Girls Hazard". Nah, that's too ordinary.<br />"Walking Bishoujos". Isn't that just girls walk?<br />"Beautiful Girls Land". That's a suspicious institution or something for sure. Arrest them, arrest!</p>
<p>While I was thinking of useless things, time is already 7:55 am. Time to go.</p>
<p>– Thank you for the meal!</p>
<p>I nonchalantly rose from the seat, cleared the plates, and was already going to the entrance, when my little sister showed her face form the slowly opening door.</p>
<p>– What?</p>
<p>– Today, 'that' is going on sale, so...</p>
<p>It's probably about fighting game 『Entendou Crash Brothers』 that she always liked. It should be obvious, but my little sister doesn't go outside, so I'm the one who usually buys her everything she wants to buy.</p>
<p>And yet, Keyaki is for some reason fidgety. Looking as if she wants to say something, she forced me to take 10,000-yen bill.</p>
<p>– What? I'll buy it, alright. I want to play it too.</p>
<p>– No. not that ...</p>
<p>Keyaki grinded in the edge of the door while muttering</p>
<p>– Um, weekend... don't go to play with anyone, OK? And new game is finally out too. There's no need to do your best in something out of your character like making a girlfriend, right?</p>
<p>– Am I not always at home? What's with the sudden feeling?</p>
<p>– Also, bringing anyone is unacceptable! That is all! Bye!</p>
<p>Cutting the conversation, she closed the door with a bang.</p>
<p>– Haha... A dry laugh escaped unconsciously from my mouth.</p>
<p>There's absolutely no one I can bring home. Sarcasm?</p>
<p>Well, Keyaki is a blunt girl. All day long she either plays net games or looks up futures prices, so she always has bags under her eyes. Her skin too looks sickly pale. I spend weekend with such a sister, while weekdays are spent on studying. And that is not so bad.</p>
<p>I may not be a school life that aunt Arika yearns for. However, I am satisfied with it. Why would I want to strain myself and change something when I'm perfectly alright with current situation?</p>
<p>Even Keyaki is like that. Contrary to appearance, she is a truly wonderful sister, who has talent for speculation and can at least easily earn money for her games. For now, she gets it with aunt's money, but in time she can earn her bread with her abilities. Is something like school even necessary for someone like her?</p>
<p>Probably for that reason, we were so satisfied with being indoor loners.<br />We were simply happy. Happy to the extent, where there was no need for adolescence.</p>
