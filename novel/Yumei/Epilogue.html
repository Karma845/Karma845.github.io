<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p>In the end, I came to my senses, and high school life ended in the blink of an eye.</p><p>And it's been exactly one year since Misaki's death.</p><p>Mizuki had advanced to the third year of middle school today, and successfully graduated from high school a few days ago.</p><p>So--</p><p>"Misaki, my eighteenth birthday has passed smoothly."</p><p>Mizuki smiled gently while folding his&nbsp;arms in front of the grave where Misaki was sleeping.</p><p>On his&nbsp;birthday a year ago, Misaki made a promise to himself and said, "Next year, I will definitely celebrate Mizuki's birthday too". Even though this promise could no longer be fulfilled, he had to at least report to Misaki, so Mizuki came to visit the grave before the first anniversary of her death.</p><p>Facing the tombstone with folded arms, Mizuki thought.</p><p>Time passed very fast.</p><p>A year ago, ever since he saw the video left by Misaki, Mizuki vowed to work hard in this world.</p><p>However, people don't change easily and graduate from high school without realizing it, but as an extension, Mizuki has been a student at a local university since April. Although it has grown somewhat compared to last year, it is still quite restless.</p><p>Well, that's what I said, but that doesn't mean Mizuki hasn't done anything this year.</p><p>Say... yes! After the third year of middle school, Mizuki makes friends in class. Fans of the same movie, fun.</p><p>From now on, if I continue to build a relationship like this, Misaki and my mother won't have to worry.</p><p>Mizuki reported this at Misaki's grave.</p><p>"Besides, I have worked hard as a member of the library committee."</p><p>said Mizuki proudly towards the tombstone.</p><p>If Mizuki left, no one would be doing behind-the-scenes work in the library. So Mizuki was constantly working behind the scenes throughout the year.</p><p>Even though the library committee counter was very busy, it was basically only once a week. Therefore, in addition to that task day, a month's behind-the-scenes work day has been assigned.</p><p>Even though Mizuki was afraid of being opposed by most people, there was no unexpected objection, Since May last year, the behind-the-scenes work started. In addition, Mizuki as a guide who served behind the scenes continuously passed on his experience so far to his juniors.</p><p>I was nervous talking to my juniors at first, but once I got used to it, it turned out to be a lot of fun. When he regained consciousness, he was able to chat with his juniors, which surprised Mizuki himself. And this was probably thanks to Misaki's training.</p><p>And this kind of tutoring work also withdrew after the end of January when free schooling started. The work that Mizuki and Misaki have always worked on has been successfully inherited by the younger generation.</p><p>"Misaki, am I okay?"</p><p>Mizuki asked his comrade who was no longer here, staring at the tombstone.</p><p>Of course there was no answering voice. Because there was only Mizuki here. However, for some reason, Mizuki also felt like hearing "Good job!".</p><p>"See you next week, the first anniversary of your death."</p><p>Smiling at Misaki's tombstone, Mizuki left the grave.</p><p>Even though it was an option to go home like this, Mizuki went elsewhere. It was the park where the two of them gazed at the stars together for the last time a year ago.</p><p>Mizuki and Misaki were sitting on a bench while talking, looking up at the night sky. And of course there could be no stars in the morning sky. However, looking at the clear blue sky, Mizuki felt his heart relieved too.</p><p>Just then, the phone in his chest pocket started vibrating.</p><p>"...Hah? Massage?"</p><p>He took out his phone and glanced at it, it was an email. Maybe it was an email from a friend. Mizuki opened the mailbox casually.</p><p>And the sender's name was written on it&#8211;&#8211;</p><p>"Misaki...?"</p><p>Mizuki almost dropped the phone from his shock. After tossing and picking it up a few times, he finally clenched the phone tightly, and Mizuki suppressed his excitement and clicked email.</p><p>"Mizuki, happy birthday! Also, congratulations on graduating from high school! Mizuki, you should go to college. So I've been a student since April. This is so good~ I envy you to death! Well, since I'm envious, I'll give Mizuki some homework. Take my share and enjoy university life well. I wish your university life to be full of smiles and happiness!"</p><p>Looking at the text in the email, Mizuki thought he heard Misaki's voice.</p><p>So, Mizuki read it over and over again, and his heart filled with Misaki's words.</p><p>Taking a closer look, the email sent date happened to be Mizuki's birthday a year ago.</p><p>Misaki was probably thinking of a way to fulfill the promise after the separation, and prepared this email for him.</p><p>Misaki still clung to her promise to the end, which made Mizuki so happy that he couldn't help himself.</p><p>And the most important...</p><p>"I couldn't even imagine that you would use this method to fulfill my promise."</p><p>Mizuki looked up at the sky and laughed "ahaha".</p><p>Even though Misaki said "whatever the format" at the time, I really admired the idea of &#8203;&#8203;sending a plain email.</p><p>At this moment, Mizuki noticed that there seemed to be a follow-up under the text of the email. So curious turned down.</p><p>"I will always support you in the other world. Come on, Mizuki!"</p><p>Written at the end is a text full of evil and love.</p><p>"&#8230;I really can't beat you."</p><p>It was the same as when I watched that video a year ago.</p><p>He really couldn't win against Misaki no matter what. Always being toyed with by her, and then forced to admit that she really likes him.</p><p>However, today it is more than that.</p><p>"Come on, Mizuki!"</p><p>In the video, Misaki says the same thing at the end. It was the magic word that pushed Mizuki's back to make him go forward.</p><p>"-Leave it to me."</p><p>This was the last homework given to him by his lover. In that case, my university life should be enriched enough to surprise Misaki in heaven.</p><p>Also, from now on, it should be enough to make Misaki and his parents proud and try their best to live.</p><p>Turning off the phone, standing up from the bench, Mizuki stared intently at the road ahead and took the first step.</p><p style="text-align: center;">
