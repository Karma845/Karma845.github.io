<h3>Chapter 1 - Transfer Student out of Season.</h3>

<p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki had a dream. It was a cloudless winter day, but very cold.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki knew that this wasn't him, but someone's memory. Now I share my senses with someone. Somehow he understood such a thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">And now, the person who shared his consciousness with himself was on the verge of life and death.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The intense heartbeat and chest pain made him stop sitting up, and he couldn't even open his eyes, his eyes closed painfully, and he fell onto the fallen leaves and struggled.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">However, at this moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Hey! Are you okay!?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">A voice came from beyond consciousness, and I felt my body being supported.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The owner of the body opened his eyes slightly, and there was an indistinct figure in his line of sight. As if someone wanted to help this person, he raised it.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The owner of the body panted heavily and tightly held onto the hand that was reaching out to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">From the shared senses, I could feel the owner of the body holding that hand with all his strength. Mizuki also realized this person's strong desire to survive.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"It does not matter! Wait a moment!"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The voice of the person who had come to help him was heard again. At the same time, Mizuki felt his body lift.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Someone, please come quickly! Please help this child!"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">In my shallow consciousness, I faintly heard screams for help. Then, the body that was lifted was moved somewhere.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Ah, then, the owner of this body must be saved.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Thinking of such a thing, Mizuki's consciousness was swallowed into deep darkness.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">- Jiriririririri!</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The high-pitched alarm clock rang in his ear.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Hmm..."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki let out a groan and slowly opened his heavy eyelids. Turning off the alarm clock while yawning, glancing at the clock. 6.30 am. This is the usual wake-up time.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Lifting his eyelids, which would close again if he was careless, Mizuki opened the curtain.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">It was sunny outside, and today was like a sunny rainy day, the sun was already hanging in the sky, emitting a fiery glow.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">While it may make one not want to go out on a rainy day, the sun is also very depressing. Once summer really begins, the weather will become even hotter, and one cannot hold one's breath just by imagining it.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"I am very sleepy..."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">I just washed my face in the bathroom to wake myself up. After picking up the towel, he glanced in the mirror and met the face in the mirror he was used to seeing. Mizuki felt a little inferior to the appearance of his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Still, staring at his own face was boring, so he rushed to the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Uncle, the next time he comes home is the end of the month,"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki muttered, glancing at the calendar installed on the fridge.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Now the only person living in this house is Mizuki. My uncle, the landlord, spent about half a year abroad because of his job. It's a pity that he now has a nice house inherited from his late parents-Grandpa Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Under such circumstances, Mizuki now felt like living alone. As for homework and the like, among his friends, he is quite capable.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Breakfast... you can order whatever you want."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">He took the natto, yogurt, and milk out of the fridge. Add the rice to the bowl, add the well-stirred natto, and breakfast is done. Put yogurt and milk on the same plate, and take breakfast into the living room.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">After breakfast, Mizuki brushed his&nbsp;teeth in the bathroom, and gently smoothed the messy hair with a hairbrush. Put on your uniform, grab your school bag and walk out the door.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">At the same time, the body sweats in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The energetic sun made people tired, Mizuki walked towards the station along the road in the scorching sun.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki, who left the house at the usual time, arrived at class calmly before the preparation bell rang. Since he didn't have any male friends who could talk to each other, he took a book out of his&nbsp;school bag and spent time reading books.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">After reading about twenty pages, the homeroom teacher came into the classroom when the class bell rang.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">After making sure everyone was seated in their seats, the homeroom teacher cleared his throat loudly.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ah&#8212;&#8212;, even though I said it at the class meeting yesterday, starting today there will be a new transfer student in our class."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The homeroom teacher's words made the class noisy, from here and there, I heard voices like "What kind of kid is that?" - "Boy? Girl?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Moving in July of the second year of high school was quite the off-season. Maybe a student with special circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Amidst the noise of the classmates, Mizuki contemplated such a thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Then it's not too late. Let me introduce her to everyone. &#8230;You can come in."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"--Yes"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Signaled by my homeroom teacher, a female student entered the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">She was slender and had shoulder-length hair. The uniform skirt is not folded, and the style is very serious.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">A child with a calm impression. That was Mizuki's first impression of the transfer student.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"It's so cute. It's so beautiful."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"She's the pretty type. Will you talk to me later?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The boy next to Mizuki quickly started discussing the transfer student's appearance. However, from the start, this kind of thing had nothing to do with Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">At this time, he met a transfer student who was looking around the class.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">At that moment, she smiled gently. Her smile was somehow friendly.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">...No, wait a minute. It was just his own illusion that she would smile when he met her eyes. It just happened as it seemed.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The reason why she was looking at Mizuki and smiling was simply unimaginable. Maybe Mizuki just read too much manga and anime. Too charming.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">However, compared to her smile, this transfer student's appearance always felt familiar.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Nice to meet you, I am Fujieda Misaki. Even though the transfer period is a bit awkward, but please take care of me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki felt a little strange. While feeling déjà vu, the transfer student had finished her self-introduction.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Under the homeroom's instructions, Misaki walked over to the seat that had been prepared. It was the very back seat on the side of the corridor. As soon as she sat down, the girl next to her immediately started talking to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki saw her figure from a distance and couldn't help but think.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For a moment, he thought of some strange things and became anxious, Mizuki had never been in contact with girls at all since he entered middle school. And after that, there probably wouldn't be a chance to get in touch with him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki didn't notice one thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki silently looked at him thinking he would have nothing to do with her anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Sweet bells ring in the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After the class meeting ended, sighed with a "yes...". Next week is the final exam, so I don't dare to relax in class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, Akiyama-san, I will hand you over to the task tomorrow."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8230;Ah, yes. Thank You."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I took the daily journal of the girl in the previous student number and placed it on my desk shakily. Even though it took her a long time to endure, Mizuki was so frightened that he almost fell to the ground when he was suddenly approached by a girl. ...even he himself was embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, Mizuki quietly left the classroom among the classmates who were chatting while preparing to leave school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki left alone from the crowd rushing towards the entrance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Excuse me. I want to borrow the library key.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Enter the office, greet the teacher next to him, pick up the key, and write his name in the library column on the blackboard.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is daily routine, so Mizuki was used to such a move.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki who got the key, walked along a different corridor from when he came. In front of him is a library. However, instead of entering the library, he turned the corner there and stopped in front of a room at the far end.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unlike the library, which became noisy with students running around to study for the exams, there were only a few people here. Just turned a corner, these are two completely different worlds.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Open the door with the key, enter the room and turn on the light. And when you enter the door, a dusty air makes your nose very uncomfortable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In this room lit by light, bookshelves were lined up in the narrow space, and there were many books inside.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is a library for storing books that don't fit in the library. Therefore, this room is full of old books that no one will read....</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of that, no one other than Mizuki would enter this room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Pass between the bookshelves and into the room. So at the end of the bookshelf, a four-seater table and chairs appeared in the corner of the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">By the way, next to the table was a book cart full of books.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Put things on the chair and plug the laptop and printer on the table.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Let's continue what we did yesterday."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He relaxed his shoulders, took a few books from the book cart, and piled them next to the laptop.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So what was Mizuki doing in this library, which was inaccessible and only had a fake name&#8212;&#8212;?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The answer is doing behind-the-scenes work in the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Be prepared for the newly purchased book to be borrowed normally. Repair tasks such as repairing damaged books and re-labeling books. Apart from other things, almost all of this was done by Mizuki himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki started working behind the scenes, exactly a year ago. It started just to help the librarian's work.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since there is no full-time school librarian in high school, so the teacher is fully responsible for the library. However, the busy schedule of teaching and consulting for club activities meant teachers really couldn't take time off, so naturally, not much time was spent on library matters, and even teachers had a hard time registering newly purchased books.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The teacher was working in the library with a tired face, and Mizuki who was a member of the library committee couldn't keep quiet anymore when he saw the teacher's appearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Teacher, I have to enter a newly purchased book into the system via the computer, then paste a barcode sticker on it, right? Please tell me how to do it. In that case, I can help you too."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">So, Mizuki proposed to replace the teacher to do the work of inserting books.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki intends to lighten the teacher's burden through his own help.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki's contributions to the library and the library committee did not stop there.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Since I started doing the work of putting in books for teachers, even if I don't have to work at the library counter, I spend a lot of time in the library on other days.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">So soaking in the library like this made Mizuki more aware of one thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki himself was like this, but because there were always a lot of students visiting the library, the library committee members on duty were always very busy. Receiving at the library counter and sorting out summer vacations, as well as the work of returning books that were returned to their original places, was also extremely difficult. This way, trivial things like repairing a broken book would be out of reach, so&#8212;&#8212;.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki said this&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Teacher, please tell me how to repair a broken book. Also, can I reassemble books with spine barcodes disabled?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">So, Mizuki also started taking care of the "out-of-reach parts".</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Later, it evolved into this system where one person does the work behind the scenes.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Of course, Mizuki didn't need to carry out such a heavy workload alone. In fact, the librarian teacher was more worried about Mizuki than grateful.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">But even so, Mizuki who persists in doing this work is actually trying to practice the "lifestyle that makes his late mother proud" that he swore two years ago.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">In fact, Mizuki didn't particularly like books, nor did Mizuki have any special feelings towards libraries. Becoming a member of the library committee is the result of a lottery. Even so, when he thought that he might be able to make the situation a little better, Mizuki couldn't give up halfway no matter what.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">What's more, Mizuki was steadfast in his belief. ...However, being too blunt can also be said to be a lack of understanding.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">By the way, this space for the library exists because Mizuki wanted a quiet and comfortable work environment, so the teacher lent it to him. Then, because Mizuki was doing this behind-the-scenes work every day, the library counter duty was also reduced. For Mizuki who wasn't good at interacting with people, this was really a very good concern.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Alright, I'll leave the reasoning aside for now. After turning on the computer, Mizuki was about to enter the title of the first book&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Eh. So this is what the school's library is like."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki was startled by the sudden voice. Mizuki fell off the chair.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">In a library where no one has to come, why is there a voice other than yourself? However, judging by the voice he heard, it seemed to be a girl's voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki's brain was in a mess, and she turned her head towards the bookshelf in the direction of the voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">And standing there was the transfer student who became today's classmate&#8212;Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Oh, hello! You're in the same class as me, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Seemingly aware of Mizuki's presence, Misaki smiled and spoke to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">You just transferred schools today, do you remember the appearance of the whole class? Mizuki, who couldn't remember human faces, greatly admired Misaki's extraordinary memory.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ah? Are you at work? Am I disturbing you? Umm..."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ah&#8212;uh&#8212;, I'm Akiyama Mizuki. Uh, I, I'm not at work, so you're not interrupting or something&#8230;"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"That's it, it's fine."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki answered hesitantly, and Misaki's smile returned.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Since it's the first day of changing schools, I was exploring the school, and I came here because I was a little worried. This room isn't bad, it's like a secret base."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Misaki didn't ask him, and Misaki looked at the books on the shelf, I explained myself.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">On the other hand, Mizuki, who had not spoken seriously to a girl in years, didn't know how to answer at all. He could only agree with "Oh, that's right.".</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Misaki suddenly came and peeked at the computer screen on the side.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Then, Mizuki-san, what are you doing in this secret base?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Wow!"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Misaki looked at the computer screen and turned to Mizuki from a very close distance. And suddenly called his name.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">On the other hand, when Misaki turned to her side, Mizuki groaned and ran towards the wall.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">And his fast running and screaming made Misaki dumbfounded.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Ah... No, I'm sorry. It's not just you, I'm like this whenever I talk to girls, don't take it to heart."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Well, I'm nothing... That? Mizuki-san, are you gynophobia?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Gynophobia? Ahaha. No. I've just been alone for too long and I don't know how to deal with my friends. I haven't been friends since high school except for my classmates who are looking for me for something! By the way, being called by my classmate by name is also the first time since elementary school!"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Why are you able to speak so easily and fluently only when you make a lonely statement? Mizuki-san, you actually have a very strong inner world, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Misaki looked at Mizuki's gaze. It's like seeing some impossible creature.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Then, she sighed with a tired "ah".</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"So what are you doing here, Mizuki-san?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Um&#8230; preparing books to borrow normally, doing simple repairs, all sorts of things. I do behind-the-scenes work in the library."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"In a place like this, and you do everything yourself?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Besides, I basically have things to do every day, so I borrowed this."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"You have to do this kind of thing every day alone, is this bullying? Wouldn't it be better to let everyone do it!"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Facing Mizuki's answer, Misaki raised her eyebrows in anger for some reason.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">In order to avoid misunderstanding, Mizuki immediately shook his head and said, "That's not the case."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Not bullying. Not because anyone forced me to do this work, but I did it myself. The reason is as I said earlier, because I am alone, so I am very busy."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"So it's like that&#8230;is that so? But, why would you want to do such a thing? Even if you say it's because of your free time, it's really hard to do it every day."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"After about an hour, if I really have nothing to do, I'll go straight home. After all, am I not just happy to be able to help other people? Should be enough to use this as motivation..."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki wasn't faking it, he was just saying it in a real way. It was an expression of confidence in what he had to do.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Misaki was slightly taken aback, then laughed softly with a hint of understanding.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"I see.... you're still the same, you're still like an "ally of justice"."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Still the same? Sorry, what are you talking about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Yes, nothing."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">In the face of her meaningful words, Mizuki asked back, while Misaki mocked him lightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"By the way, I know what Mizuki-san is doing hiding in a place like that."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Your statement is a bit strange. It does not matter."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Misaki's misunderstanding is driving him crazy. Seeing this, Misaki said "Ahaha, I'm sorry" in a relaxed and apologetic tone.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Hey, Mizuki-san. Is that book on the table you want to operate now? How do you want to operate it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"This is a recently purchased book, so register it in the library system and place a barcode sticker and spine label on it."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Just like that, Mizuki took out a book he had worked on yesterday from the book cart and handed it to Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Misaki took the book and looked at it.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The barcode sticker on the cover and the spine label with the dialing number on the spine is neatly attached without being skewed.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">The same goes for the other finished books on the cart. Misaki looked at the basket of books and knew that not only was the back label of none of the books stuck at an angle, but that even the height of the back sticker was exactly the same. I took it out and took a look, and the barcode on the cover was also neatly positioned.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Misaki put the book back in the cart and sighed in admiration.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Well, Mizuki-san is really amazing. In general, it's impossible for someone to do behind-the-scenes work alone. Not only that, but just by reading these books, you can see how seriously Mizuki-san works. normal."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Well...thank you"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki looked away embarrassed at Misaki's compliment. This is the first time his behind-the-scenes work has been so positively praised, which makes him very embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Can I help with this work too?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"...Hah?"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Misaki put her hands on her hips and said something strange while Mizuki was confused.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Facing Misaki's sudden suggestion, Mizuki made a dull sound without even being shy.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"I am moved by Mizuki-san's courage and conscientious work attitude, so I also want to help Mizuki-san with his work!"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Misaki looked into the eyes as if she had made a good proposal.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">So, this time. It was Mizuki's turn to look at Misaki as if she saw something unbelievable.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Um... I'm glad you have this heart, but I just started doing it because I like it... So there's no need to help me. And the final exam is coming soon"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki quietly answered Misaki with the hidden meaning of "please come back".</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">To be honest, Mizuki wanted to do his best to avoid coexisting with the girls in the library. In his view, this kind of state was a kind of punishment game for him.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"I only helped you because I wanted to. And I said that the final exam is coming, isn't it the same for Mizuki-san? Let's do it together, hurry up and study after finishing it. Mizuki-san!"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"No, no, even if you do it together, it might be faster... But, no matter what, it's not good for you, Fujieda-san..."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Don't talk this nonsense! I really don't care. Not good."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">After saying that, Misaki grabbed Mizuki's hand and pulled him towards the table.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">On the other hand, Mizuki, who was suddenly grabbed by the girl's hand, was in chaos. It would be better to say that by then, he was already unconscious. Therefore, he was completely unable to resist, and was placed on a chair in the blink of an eye.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Come on, Mizuki-san! Hurry up and get to work!"</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Misaki took advantage of the situation and sat opposite Mizuki. She gave him a look of anticipation.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">This didn't seem like a problem Mizuki's communication skills could solve. He had absolutely no confidence that he could persuade her with words alone. Mizuki also didn't dare to forcefully refuse the other party's request.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"...Ah, alright."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki replied with a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">After all, Misaki wanted to help out on a whim, so it should be enough to let her work for a day.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki thought so, pulled out his laptop, and started to prepare the work that would be handed over to Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"In that case, I will be responsible for entering data into the system. Fujieda-san, you will be in charge of sticking the barcode and back label on the book while looking at the book list."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Just look at the list of books, confirm the title of the book, then label the book. Stick it in a fixed position. If that's the case, even if I leave it to Misaki, who's still a rookie, it shouldn't be a big deal. Even if the location of the sticker is a bit odd, it will not affect the borrowing of the book. If it still didn't work, Mizuki would do a second check later and it would be done.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">"Okay-! Leave it to me. I'll stick it tightly."</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Mizuki thought that this person was a bit strange, but at the same time, he also felt that he was somewhat enjoying the situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">It might not be a bad thing to have days like this once in a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">Despite feeling that his condition was a little wrong, Mizuki started to do his own thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was time for the second day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although Mizuki was worried that Misaki would come and talk to him in class, his worries were unnecessary.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I watched the video of the cat that Misaki gave me yesterday at home. This is very nice!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really!? If it makes you laugh&#8230; I suggest you watch this too!&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Mizuki went to school in the morning, Misaki was already chatting happily with the girls in class. Although I heard that interpersonal relationships between girls are very complicated, Misaki seems to be easy to adjust, she must be very good at winning people's hearts. This was in stark contrast to Mizuki, who had been in this class for three months and had yet to find someone to talk to.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On this day, Misaki did not come to the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Sure enough, what happened yesterday was only Misaki's will.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing from a distance Misaki who had become a "good classmate" in class in the blink of an eye, Mizuki thought so. She didn't come from the same world as him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For Mizuki, this was a normal state. And yesterday was just an extraordinary festival like a festival, and from today, everything would return to the lonely everyday life again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though he was feeling a little lonely, Mizuki was relieved that he would return to his daily life, and changed his mood in a positive and optimistic direction.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, after school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You've worked hard."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki went to the library as usual, while Misaki was standing at the door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki waved at Mizuki as if waiting for his arrival.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...Feeling confused for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Because Mizuki-san, you're not here, so I can't enter the library. Where did I borrow the library keys? Office? Remember to tell me how to borrow the keys next time. I'll borrow them when I arrive first."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki said kindly to the dumbfounded Mizuki. This sense of distance is truly "good friends". Was this the person who heard the rumour?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, unfortunately Mizuki was in the opposite position of the popular person. He couldn't shorten the distance like Misaki did before, but he still wanted to keep his distance from Misaki. Being around other people can drain you of stress.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That&#8230; Fujieda-san, why are you here?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah? Why, didn't I say yesterday I wanted to "help you"?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Mizuki's question, Misaki said, "What are you asking? ah," she replied with an expression on her&nbsp;face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki almost felt dizzy when he got an answer he didn't want to hear. Still, he tried his best to avoid falling on the spot, as if holding on to his last hope, he asked again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That...wasn't the favor you said limited to yesterday?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How could I do such a cruel thing! Since I said I would help you, I will help until the end!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki showed a 100% friendly smile and patted Mizuki on the shoulder as she said "let's work together". I almost lost consciousness like yesterday, but this time I managed to hold it in.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it was an ordinary boy, he would probably be so happy that he raised his hand to agree to such a proposal.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki, who was used to being aloof and socially distant, felt quite the opposite. Every day in the library with girls and stuff... I really don't have that kind of psychological quality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki placed his mental breakdown and guilt for rejecting Misaki's good intentions on the scale. So, even though he felt like he was doing something really bad, he decided to try to fight back one last time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"However, this is the work of the library committee.... It's really a matter of asking Fujieda-san to help me do this..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I said it yesterday, don't be so polite. And Mizuki-san, it was because of your own idea. Are you going to take over this job? You're already outside the scope of a "normal job" as a library committee member."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, even though I said so..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Me and Mizuki-san are the same. I also felt this work was very meaningful, so I came to help you. Is there something wrong with this?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, nothing's wrong at all... But..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah...Could it be? Say, staying by your side for a commoner like me...would that just get in the way?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki lowered her head with a sad expression. She seemed to have misunderstood Mizuki's reason for refusing so much.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And... because of guilt, he could barely even stand up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He already felt bitter for rejecting Misaki's good intentions. After he said that, he didn't have the courage to refuse.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki sighed as if giving up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...No, that won't get in the way. The important thing is that I don't have enough experience in this job to be able to rule around Fujieda-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"In that case, okay--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"As you said, Fujieda-san, I did this work myself. So, since Fujieda-san said you wanted to help, I have no right to stop you. But this job is very boring."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After speaking, Mizuki lowered his head to Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So Misaki said, "Please take care of each other!" and laugh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She seemed quite happy, which was great. As for the mental stress that comes with being with Misaki&#8230; Well, Mizuki secretly swore in his heart that he would keep his spirits up and endure it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's almost the end of the conversation, let's get to work! Mizuki-san, turn on the computer!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Actually, you don't need to be so nervous. This job is quite relaxing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki is fine! It's too natural to call you by your surname. By the way, no need to say honorifics. I want you to speak with a docile mouth."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh, call your name? This is a little too difficult... Let's talk, I feel... like some sort of defensive instinct, how should I put it... Sorry, I'll try my best, but for now..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing the more aggressive Misaki closing in at the distance, Mizuki could only reply incoherently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To what extent can he fulfill his emotional state? Will there really be a day when he will call out by her&nbsp;name?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki felt uneasy about the future and opened the library door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I will accompany you to the end!" This sentence seemed serious, and Misaki actually came to the library almost every day, except when she had an appointment with her friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unless Misaki greets first and says that they can't go to the library, the two don't chat in class, and work behind the scenes together in the library after school. Although it's not like secretly dating, it still feels like a double life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And fortunately, Mizuki's psychological ability did not reach its limit, but gradually got used to the environment in which Misaki was there day by day. Human adaptation is still fairly reliable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just as Mizuki felt these things, he realized that the final exams had also ended, and in the blink of an eye, it was the farewell ceremony for this semester.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tomorrow is summer vacation. Hey, Mizuki-san, are you going to continue doing behind-the-scenes work during summer vacation?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki asked while collecting books that needed repair from the library. Glue the rotten pages with the diluted paste.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It had been about three weeks since Misaki had started helping Mizuki behind the scenes. She mastered all kinds of work in one fell swoop. Has become a truly reliable partner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki also glued the scraped page with watery paste, and answered while returning the book.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, that's what I planned. For me, I don't really want to do anything in the summer except study. The library is open two days a week, so I'll be doing some work on those days."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah. Then I will accompany you too. What's the time now?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You don't need to push yourself. After all, this is a rare summer vacation. You'd better go out with your friends and relax to your heart's content."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mizuki-san, you say again. That's all. Spending summer vacation with girls should be the first achievement of your life, Mizuki-san. It's also a choice for you to be honest and happy, okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not denying that this is indeed life. It was the first time in the middle of the year, but when I said that in person, I was furious. How about you, Misaki-san, who talk wildly?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ahaha. Secret?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, regarding the manner of greeting, in the end, I was forced into submission by Misaki-san.... Even though the level of communication skills with people had increased to 2 after growing up, it still couldn't match Misaki who had almost reached level 50. Incidentally, the title honor couldn't be changed no matter what, so Misaki herself gave in. After all, when it comes to summer vacation, the book restoration is complete, and the behind-the-scenes work is also done.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There were no classes in the afternoon, and there wasn't much to do today, so I thought about finishing it before lunch, and since I was doing it while speaking, it took more time than I thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After packing the books and computer on the table, the two had a long overdue lunch together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki ate the rice balls and vegetable buns bought at the commissioner. Misaki ate a small bento that she made herself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After entering high school, Mizuki barely had the opportunity to eat with other people, and to him, having lunch with Misaki was very friendly, and to some extent, quite happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thinking about it, it can be said that time like this is very precious, and perhaps should be more grateful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki looked at Misaki, who was eating the bento, thinking about such a thing, and inadvertently caught her attention as she raised her head. Misaki's dark brown eyes reflected Mizuki's shaky figure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, I kept staring at you while you were eating."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki thought that he made the other party feel uncomfortable, so he immediately apologized.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's fine. After all, I'm sitting face to face, so there's nothing to worry about. If I didn't want to be stared at by you, I wouldn't have sat across from you. &#8212;Well, I don't want to look directly at you. That's all."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki answered with a thumping response. And if she insisted, she seemed a little surprised by Mizuki's overly cautious part.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Compared to this, Mizuki-san, this is a rare lunch, let's talk about something interesting."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8230;Sounds simple, but your requirements are too difficult. This is too much bullshit."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay, don't take it to heart. For example, is there anything interesting or cool about the library committee's work?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I thought about it..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Misaki's slightly more specific request, Mizuki folded his arms and thought hard.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Holding that posture, he thought about the topic for about ten seconds. Mizuki finally found a topic that matched Misaki's request and raised his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is what the librarian teacher told me earlier."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh! It looks like the topic is going to be very deep."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, did you know? The cockroaches actually eat the book. So, there are some cockroaches in the library. A girl found a cockroach's body earlier, screaming..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Mizuki-san, despite you, I'm glad I racked my brains on the topic, but it's too inappropriate to say this while eating. I'll make it more subtle... can't it get any worse?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Not like this. Is it worse...Is that so..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking at Mizuki, who was calmly showing off the atmosphere from the look of anticipation on his face, Misaki showed with a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And Mizuki, who was told "There's nothing worse than this", was sad and very disappointed. Since he brought up this topic after racking his brains, Misaki's evaluation was also quite heart-wrenching.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this time, Misaki suddenly covered her mouth with her hand, and her shoulders began to tremble slightly. Mizuki's lost appearance seemed to be in Misaki's hands. Even though she tried to keep her&nbsp;voice down, he could still easily see that she was smiling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's a bit too much to laugh out loud, isn't it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry&#8230;sorry&#8230;But Mizuki-san is so cute&#8230;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8230;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It wasn't just Mizuki who was made fun of even being called 'cute', turning from gloomy to dazed. It was empty as if a soul had been taken.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki laughed for a moment. Finally getting rid of the smile, the eyes of the two overlapped again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry, Mizuki-san. I'm fine."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry Misaki-san, I'm really in trouble."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Rare species. Mizuki-san, who was lethargic just now, is as cute as a Chihuahua being scolded."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can't stand it now because I chased and beat me so hard. Can you let me go?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Misaki looking refreshed, Mizuki replied with a gloomy expression.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">His eyes had completely lost their expression. Not only was he ridiculed, but he was even treated as a rare and exotic beast.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;But I really like Mizuki-san who can express her feelings really well."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Eh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki made a flat sound and turned his gaze to Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"After all, Mizuki-san, when you first started out, you were always wary of me, either with an expressionless face or with constant fear of me. It was like a cat. But, now you can convey your feelings to me well. As a friend , I'm very happy"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I...is that so?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. So Mizuki-san, from now on you have to laugh!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Even though I only faintly feel, Misaki-san, you should pay more attention to your own words and sentences."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If there was no last sentence, Mizuki was really touched....</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki half opened his eyes and looked at Misaki, who in the end let everything go to waste.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Misaki's sarcasm towards Mizuki was simply "don't take it to heart" and putting it off was like an understatement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Misaki's nonchalant attitude, Mizuki felt that his anger was foolish, and laughed along with her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's what I said, but when did I become Misaki-san's friend?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I always thought so&#8230; Mizuki-san, isn't this confusing to you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tree question, Misaki asked hesitantly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I'm quite happy. After all, it's the first time I've made friends since elementary school."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't take such sad things lightly. It's hard to respond to you&#8230;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, my friends back then were completely out of touch now, so Misaki-san is my only friend in the present."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, no, this is not something one can say "by the way". Too heavy!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki's overly sad self-disclosures in succession made Misaki groan.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki himself didn't feel lonely being alone, but it was fortunate that Misaki could be shy. After all, being bothered by her&nbsp;for so long, a bit of revenge probably won't be punished. Because - they are "friends".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"In that case, work is done, so it is almost time to return today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, it's already three o'clock. &#8212;&#8212;Alright, let's go back."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki greeted Misaki, put the trash in the bag, and the tissue that had previously been prepared to clean the table. Don't be afraid of ten thousand, just in case any leftovers on the table will cause moldy books.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki also answered, and started packing her lunch box. Then she took out pillboxes from the bag one by one, put the regular pills in her&nbsp;mouth, and swallowed them with water. Since the lunch box was so small, the pills were probably some kind of nutritional supplement or something.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, it's over!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki stared in disbelief at Misaki who spoke loudly as if she had messed up something.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Mizuki like this, Misaki folded her arms apologetically and continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, Mizuki-san. Will you be free later?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, are you okay&#8230;. What's wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Actually, there's something I want to ask Mizuki-san as my "friend"&#8230;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Help...? Help me as a 'friend'? What happened...? Ah! Could it be that you want to borrow money!?</span></p><p><span style="font-family: inherit; font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki had a dream.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That place was probably the consultation room of a certain hospital. In front of him was a man in a white coat who looked like a doctor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No impression of place. A scene without memory. Just like the past, it was a dream in one's memory.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The doctor looked at the document in hand and started talking towards him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, his voice was indistinct, as if he was listening through the door, so he couldn't hear it clearly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki knew the reason. The owner of this body refuses to listen to the doctor's words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"A year if it's fast. You may not live to be twenty at most..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This sentence was the only one I heard clearly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At the same time, the field of vision began to point downwards. The owner of the body lowered his head. Mizuki could almost feel the intense vibes from this stranger he had never met.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, sharing the feeling of being trapped in a bottomless swamp, Mizuki's consciousness plunged into deep darkness...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saturday</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a few days. In the morning, Mizuki came to the urban area and stood vacantly under the clock tower in the square in front of the station. Since it was a holiday, he was wearing a T-shirt, a plaid top, gray shorts, and sneakers. Even though he wasn't short, it was probably because he had a baby face, and if he wasn't good, he looked like a middle school student.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking around, apart from myself, there were many people waiting for others. Mizuki never dreamed that one day she would be among them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, why was Mizuki standing at such a classic meeting place? Of course there is a reason.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki's thoughts flashed across the scene that afternoon. The reason why he was standing here was because of the line Misaki said&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that borrowing money!? That's not the case! I just want you to go to the movies with me!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, what's wrong, you're asking me to go to the cinema&#8230;Wait, a movie? Shall we go see it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was Misaki's request that day. She wanted Mizuki to accompany her to the movies.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For Mizuki, who was mentally prepared, there was a feeling that the bamboo basket was empty. But at the same time that he felt relieved, Mizuki also had a question in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you want to watch a movie, you don't need to ask me out. Wouldn't it be better to go with your boyfriend? Misaki-san, you should have lots of friends in your class."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mizuki-san, that&#8230;. People are willing to accompany me to see&#8230; Moreover, I need a little courage to see it alone&#8230;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No one wants to accompany you to see it, then you're afraid to see it for yourself... What do you want to see? What movie?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's an ordinary movie! An ordinary movie with no age limit! On the other hand, it's Mizuki-san, you said 'want to see' yourself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Mizuki's trembling question, Misaki, who seemed to think he misunderstood, continued to explain. So she also took advantage of the situation and mentioned the name of the movie she wanted to see.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Granted, the trailer for the film, even the one seen on TV, is the latest sci-fi blockbuster, not a dubious one. Mizuki also felt a little relieved about this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">By the way, if you haven't seen the previous work, you won't understand the plot of this film, so almost all of the fans are male.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, the film is very likely to be rejected by girls who have never seen the same series. In the eyes of men, it is just a collection of romance... For example, in the previous work&#8212;&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's a real feeling. Everyone said they weren't interested. Well, if it weren't for Mizuki-san's recommendation, I wouldn't even be interested in watching that movie series. It feels a bit scary..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki interrupted Mizuki's impending speech and sighed heavily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">By the way, as Misaki said, Mizuki is a huge fan of the film series, and this new work will also hit theaters.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And Mizuki doesn't like gathering in crowds, so he plans to watch it about a month after its release. And a month later to be exact now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, Mizuki had absolutely no opinion on the contents of this invitation. However, the only problem...that the person who made the invitation was Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mizuki-san, what's wrong? I see your reluctance."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I was wondering if Misaki-san and I would meet a bit outside of school&#8230;."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Not good. &#8230;Ah! Could it be, Mizuki-san, are you worried about being seen by your classmates or something? Or are you afraid of being laughed at by others? Hmm&#8212;this is a bit embarrassing indeed. Ahaha"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki blushed and smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki shook his head, "No, it's not like that"&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If I stay with Misaki-san, will other people think that you're the "poor blackmailed high school kid"...or something like, "I paid you to accompany me on a date" or something..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Sorry, Mizuki-san. Even I couldn't hold back what I said earlier."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki's expression instantly turned cloudy, her entire body covered in clouds. Trembling, she puffed out her cheeks and looked at Mizuki. It seemed she was quite angry that she was being treated as an evil mercenary.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, I was joking."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even Mizuki, who wasn't good at seeing the atmosphere, sensed his own danger, and he immediately lowered his head and apologized. As for what he really thought in his heart, that was Mizuki's own secret.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After hearing Mizuki's apology, Misaki temporarily averted her glare.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, I'll let you go this time. And you can relax. For someone like Mizuki-san, no matter what you do or who you do it with, no one will care."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm really sorry, please forgive me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Mizuki apologize again, Misaki said, "I'm not angry anymore" and turned her face away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Compared to this, let me tell you what we promised! Let's go to the cinema this Saturday. If the movie starts this hour... um! Then at 10:30 am, wait under the clock tower in the square ahead. station."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, you've already decided on this..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki checked the cinema website on her cell phone and quickly arranged her schedule.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As if there was no veto, Mizuki cast a surrender vote.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Above is the conversation between Mizuki and Misaki when they were going back on the day of the graduation ceremony. Just when Mizuki was thinking to himself,</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(It turns out that unexpected things in the world can happen so easily.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mizuki-san, you came so early."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A voice came from behind, Mizuki turned to follow the voice. And as expected, Misaki was standing there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A sleeveless white top with a light blue short skirt is also cool in the scorching heat, which is a very refreshing dress. The hairstyle has also been carefully braided, and it is more mature than a school dress.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Misaki who felt completely different from before, Mizuki couldn't help but feel a little touched. And only now did he finally realize that he was dating a "girl".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I asked you to come out, but I asked you to wait for me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, it's fine. The appointment time is 10:30, and you're not late."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While calming his heartbeat, Mizuki looked up at the clock tower behind Misaki. The hands of the clock pointed to 10:25. So no need to apologize.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Besides, I didn't wait that long. It was only about ten minutes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Right now, you shouldn't have said how long you waited. It's really like Mizuki-san. At a time like this, even if it's a lie, just say "I just arrived"."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even though I hear sentences like this a lot, does anyone actually say that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Who knows? At least I've never heard of it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Mizuki's simple question, Misaki smiled and shook her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Immediately, she looked at Mizuki with a somewhat mischievous look.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even if you say that, you waited here fifteen minutes before the appointed time&#8230; Mizuki-san, were you looking forward to this day?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's definitely what I was looking forward to! I didn't say it, I watched the whole series of films in theaters. New work this time too, I was already looking forward to it when the trailer was released!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Well, but that's not what I wanted to ask. I was so stupid to ask Mizuki-san a question like this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki answered the question honestly and excitedly when asked if he was looking forward to it. But his consciousness really flew into the film.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In response, Misaki could only mumble, "This man is really..." and sighed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Forget it. Even though it's still a bit early, let's go to the cinema first. If you don't get a ticket, that will be bad."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. After all, it's rare to spend a lot of money to go see it, at least it's better to have a good location. Let's go Misaki-san!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki replied cheerfully to the slightly depressed Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two of them walked away in the crowd in completely different circumstances, either in mood or otherwise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">About three and a half hours after meeting in front of the station.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes&#8212;so satisfying! I really enjoyed watching the movie, but it was tiring."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. But it's a comfortable exhaustion."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki added syrup and milk to the iced coffee, and took a sip. Due to the concentration of watching a movie for almost two hours, cold coffee penetrates the hot body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What remains after drinking coffee is the sense of detachment that comes after enjoying a perfect movie. Absolutely awesome.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki also sat on the opposite seat while drinking milk coffee and heaved a sigh of relief. At this moment, Misaki suddenly lowered her head towards Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mizuki-san, thank you for inviting me to the cinema earlier."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh? Ah, it's okay, don't worry about it. Because I also received enough pocket money."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki temporarily put the coffee on the table and shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indeed, as Misaki said, Mizuki paid for the movie ticket.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But the money wasn't actually Mizuki's pocket money or savings.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Actually, last night, I told my uncle who sometimes comes home about going to the movies with Misaki-san. Then he said, "This is a man's hobby" and gave me 10,000 yen... So I just followed my uncle. If you want to thank my uncle, you better go and thank my uncle."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ahaha. Even this kind of thing doesn't say anything without hiding it. It's really Mizuki-san's style. Yes. You should have said you didn't like being cool, or you were honest enough to be a little outspoken. Then you remember to say "thank you" to your uncle for me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Understood. I'll tell him tonight."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Misaki smiling happily, Mizuki also often nodded in response.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It was a shock to see it in the cinema. Even though I haven't been to the cinema in years, maybe this time is the right time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, do you think so too? By the way. Personally, I really like the battle scenes between the space fleets, what do you think of Misaki-san?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm! That's very strong. The sound is beeping."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Right! In this series, this fleet battle is one of the selling points. I think this fleet battle is the best in the whole series! And this new work, not only the story is well written, the acting skills of the actors are already present, and the technology the picture is also good! Not only do not lose at all This is a rare good film based on the old works of the past, and also promotes CG and other technologies to an orthodox position! In my heart, it is undoubtedly the best film of years. Waiting for it to be released was so worth it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wonder if she remembers the shocking battle scene that took place on the big screen of the cinema, said Mizuki with a fiery gaze and a very enthusiastic tone. A look that is really in a state.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki was so frightened by Mizuki that she leaned back slightly with an "Oh...". Then, reluctantly to deal with it, she also mounted the Mizuki machine gun after that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, there is a limit to patience.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mi, Mizuki-san, calm down first!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki interrupted Mizuki and made a calming motion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki who was suddenly interrupted while speaking, looked confused.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki immediately reviewed what had happened in the last few minutes, and after thinking about the meaning of Misaki's actions, he opened his mouth in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, I lost control. I always talk to myself very loudly.... If you keep talking like me, you must be really tired. I'm really sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki bowed his head deeply and apologized, followed by words of reflection.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Paying no heed to Misaki, he continued to say his own words as he wished. Completely prioritizing himself, he failed to consider Misaki's feelings. As a result, Misaki felt displeased. Mizuki wholeheartedly apologized to Misaki for her rudeness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, no... It's true that I'm a little scared of Mizuki-san's machine gun, but you don't have to apologize all the time. Exchanging feelings is also really fun after watching the movie. &#8212;&#8212;But, because I also want to tell you something, Mizuki-san, I'd be happy if you could calm down a bit..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki said as if she was worried about Mizuki who was really depressed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In response, Mizuki raised his lowered gaze and looked at Misaki with a strange expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do you want to tell me? What is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is very serious, very important... Today, I will invite you out to watch a movie, and half of the purpose is to talk to you about this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki urged the slightly embarrassed Mizuki, making a speech like an opening remark.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Judging from Misaki's expression, it would be better to say that watching the movie was just a coincidence, and this was the real problem.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While it wasn't a lie that he wanted to go to the movies, he just felt like using it as an excuse, so his embarrassment was probably because of that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, what's the important thing Misaki wants to say? And it's very important that Mizuki needs to be invited outside of school to say...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki racked his brains to find the answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, could it be behind-the-scenes work? For example, you can't help me..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No. I will continue to help you in the future. What I want to say has nothing to do with school. Mizuki, that's a more personal matter."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki immediately gave a negative answer to Mizuki's speculation. Even though it seemed like there were so many things Mizuki could think about, it didn't seem right.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">By the way, the fact that Misaki wouldn't disappear and felt a little relieved was a secret that only Mizuki knew.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But leaving that aside, if my guess isn't right, then I really don't know what Misaki really wants to say.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This has nothing to do with school, it's a personal matter... And, it's still serious, important stuff....</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki recalled the password given by Misaki once again. Then he thought about it for about a minute. At this moment, a strange reason appeared in his mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...Wait? Are you saying this is the only one? The thing called "confession" that often appears in novels. Could he finally usher in the legendary "peach blossom period"?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki immediately denied his reasoning "No matter how you put it, it's impossible.".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is not a matter of pride. In the sixteen and a half years of his life, Mizuki had never been liked by girls. In other words, before being liked, he was never taken care of.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Does anyone claim to be like that? Hahaha, what a joke that is.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...Not true, but. Mizuki was also very concerned about Misaki's cunning attitude. Will there be a chance because I made a mistake&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, let me put it first, it's not like 'please date me' or this kind of love confession."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki took the lead in cutting Mizuki's dream of a yellow ray with one blade. It is neat and tidy without even room for explanation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki's faint hope was crushed, and he dropped his shoulders in despair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But. I didn't do it right, but it's not that far. I don't want you to be my lover, but I want you to be a different being to me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"A different being...?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki was confused by what Misaki said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki and Misaki are now in a partnership as classmates who work behind the scenes, and are friends as Misaki says. Therefore other than lovers, what kind of relationship does she want to build? Mizuki couldn't guess what Misaki was thinking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry. What are you thinking, Misaki-san, I really don't know. Can you tell me the answer?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki sighed and waved the white flag at Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, Misaki "understood" nodded, and cleared her throat as if she was about to reset the battle&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mizuki-san, can yo</span><span style="font-size: large;">u form a Ferōshippu with me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: large;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She said to Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ferōshippu...?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki on the other hand had a blank expression. His mind couldn't fulfill Misaki's unexpected request.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ferōshippu. In English it is Alliance. From the impression I learned in history class, this word always gives people a very serious feeling. Based on the life of an ordinary high school student, this word might not have had a chance to be spoken.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So why did Misaki propose such a contractual relationship?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, I'm sorry. Why did you go out of your way to get something as rigid as an alliance? Let's be friends for now. Isn't that enough?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki was still expressing what he was thinking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As for Mizuki's question, Misaki seemed to have anticipated it for a long time, and she immediately shook her head "um, no".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Because, I want to ask the people who have formed an alliance. I can't ask you to just be friends, it's too much."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is it too heavy&#8230;? Sorry. I think so. I understand what Misaki-san wants to ask me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing what Misaki said to himself with a wry smile, Mizuki shook his head helplessly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki wants to form an alliance. And the things you want to ask for, you can't ask for just friends, things are too heavy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki's imagination didn't know what Misaki was expecting at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, facing the confused Mizuki, Misaki suddenly said such words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Actually, I'm sick. It's almost out of time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.Eh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her expression was also very calm, no matter how lamented or sad, it never showed on her face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The contrast between Misaki's tone and expression and the content of her words was too great, which made Mizuki unable to immediately understand what she meant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, after a while, Mizuki finally understood the seriousness of the matter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After understanding&#8230; Mizuki felt cold and numbness in the tips of his fingers and toes. Misaki's words had an enormous impact.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Is that true?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, that's true. No matter what, I won't make fun of something that isn't funny at all."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki nodded again with a wry smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course Mizuki knew that Misaki wasn't someone who would make silly jokes like that&#8230;. And, if she was suffering from such a serious illness, it also matched the drugs she drank in large quantities at lunch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, Mizuki had to be sure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then, is it okay if you don't go to the hospital? Is it possible to prolong your life as long as you receive proper treatment?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But the doctor told me, 'Even if you were hospitalized, you wouldn't live to be twenty years old at the most.' Even if I have to live less, I choose to get out of the hospital. Because before I leave, there are still things I want to do no matter what..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Mizuki who was worried and said more and more, Misaki still smiled and answered slowly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since Misaki is here now, she is mentally prepared for all that will await her at the end of this choice. Her steady expression, on the other hand, showed the firmness of her resolve.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What's more, Mizuki was very concerned about Misaki's words, "You can't live twenty years at most, or a year if it's sooner." He felt like he had heard something similar somewhere recently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki couldn't remember where he heard this sentence, so he could only ignore this sense of sight for now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The matter had come to this point, and Mizuki already understood this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki wanted to ask the people who formed the alliance. That is--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"In that case, things that are too tough to ask your friends are..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. Before I leave, there are a few things I want you to do with me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki revealed the answer that Mizuki had guessed in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No, not only that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course, I didn't mean to want an unfair alliance that only benefits me. As long as it's something I can do, no matter what it is, I can fulfill Mizuki-san's request."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because it's an alliance. Mizuki, so the position should be the same. The favors received must be repaid in kind. Misaki made such a proposition to Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, girls can't say 'I can fulfill any request'."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki didn't have the courage and momentum to say, "Then do it". Even if Misaki suddenly said that to herself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He expressed his most sincere reaction, and at the same time worried about the danger in Misaki's words and deeds. On the other hand, the answer is quite clever.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ahaha, don't worry. I know that too. Also, since Mizuki-san was worried about me about this, I guess it's fine to make such a condition. It's proof of my trust in Mizuki-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Mizuki's reaction, Misaki also smiled happily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki felt both happy and embarrassed when Misaki said that with a smile full of confidence. Unconsciously blushed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, blushing all the time is not a solution.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Accompanying Misaki to do what she wanted to do before dying&#8212;&#8212;. It's a role with great responsibility, and as she puts it, what she carries is "too heavy stuff". Naturally, restlessness rose in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"A person like me... can I really accompany Misaki-san to do what you want?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That is, I hope you can go with me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But, even if you go with me, there will be nothing very interesting. I can't have a good conversation.... If you just go out to play. Wouldn't it be easier and happier to be with your female friends?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki was still aware of the fact that he was an impersonal man. Even if you went to play with such a person, you would definitely not feel happy. This would probably just waste the little time that was left of Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Misaki shook her head "Nothing like that".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Now, today, I am already very happy. In front of Mizuki-san, I don't need to disguise myself, and I can defend my true self. Today's movie, I can watch today's movie with you, Mizuki-san, I really feel happy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I...Is that so?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes! Mizuki-san, you should be more confident. And the person I want to make an alliance with is none other than Mizuki-san!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing the flustered Mizuki, Misaki gave a strong affirmation, and even used a tone that wouldn't make sense if it weren't for Mizuki, and insisted firmly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I feel good about myself. Mizuki never expected to be so happy to be told like that. But he didn't even understand why Misaki gave him such a high evaluation, but he was even more confused.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other hand, it seemed that Misaki's strong claim just now seemed too much. I've always felt that her expression was a little "Messed up!" a feeling. I don't know if it's only now that I feel embarrassed, she blushes like a tomato.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Misaki immediately cleared her throat as if hiding this, and showed a bright smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, when I say Mizuki-san is suitable, I mean&#8230; um! It's because I'm happy to see you! Mmm! Even though I say it now, you can be more confident!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"......Are you praising me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course I commend you. Mizuki-san, even though you don't have any friends, your communication skills are very strong. So you can relax more and talk nonsense to me as much as you like in the future!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, people with strong communication skills obviously don't say things like that, right? By the way, Misaki-san, are you really making fun of me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Mizuki's complaint, Misaki said, "No, such a thing." She smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As for what Misaki was hiding, even Mizuki knew it. It's just that Misaki doesn't want to explain it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, but I was joking that I would feel happy when I see you... But it's true that I want to rely on Mizuki-san. So, please. Please stay with me for this short time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki straightened her body. posture, and bowed her head to Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other hand, Mizuki wasn't mentally ready. How he should answer, he himself had not thought about.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah... After forming an alliance and going out together, it looks like we're really dating... Ah, I was kidding..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of that, Mizuki made an inexplicable joke. And after he finished speaking, he regretted his embarrassment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Sorry, please forget what I said earlier."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so? Actually, I was also able to change the name of the alliance to "Love Alliance" at Mizuki-san's request. Even so, I was able to achieve my goal, and Mizuki-san, you have reached the age to care about this kind of thing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mind your own business! Most importantly, what kind of face should I lick to call "girlfriend" to someone who said "it's not about love" not too long ago? Is that really the same as a customer spending money to buy a relationship??"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see. If that's the case, I'd probably be very angry. A name change should be made."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki said, taking back her words to change her name.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki was probably showing her own concern about the fact that Mizuki was bothered by himself. To lighten the mood of a scene like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, that doesn't mean Mizuki can come to a conclusion if the mood subsides...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, regarding the alliance, I really can't give you an immediate answer. I'm not sure if I'm up to the task... I'm really sorry. I'm sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you want to delay answering, you should at least be honest about how you feel right now. Having reached such a conclusion, Mizuki shamelessly told Misaki what was in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so&#8230; Well, after all, I was talking about this all of a sudden, so of course you'd be confused."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki nodded with a helpless smile at Mizuki's sincerity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Misaki didn't give up here either.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: large;">"Then, how about doing one thing with me in the form of a temporary contract? Then you decide whether to formally form an alliance with me, how about that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki quickly made her next proposal.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Once you've made a request that's too big, make it a little smaller so it's easier to accept. I don't know if it was intentional or not, but Misaki's negotiation skills are really clever.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What's more, it was a fact that Mizuki himself could no longer ignore Misaki's wishes, considering he had already grasped the situation. Even though he felt cheated, he nodded in agreement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then let me follow Misaki-san's request for a temporary contract."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that true!? Good!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But in the end, it was only a temporary contract. Don't expect too much. Okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's okay too. Thank You!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki thanked him happily, probably because of the next reply.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this moment, Misaki extended her right hand towards Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Um, what's wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it? Handshake. Even if it's only temporary, it can be taken as a memorial to the formation of an alliance.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki smiled and lightly opened her red lips.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki stared blankly at the right hand outstretched to him and Misaki's smile alternated.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At such times, it is polite to shake hands with other people. Because of that, it was the first time since the lower grades of elementary school that I held the hand of a woman other than my mother. Mizuki wiped the sweat from his palm under the table and held Misaki's hand nervously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then please take care of me, Mizuki-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mmmm, umm... take care of me too"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki faced Misaki with a smile on her face.</p> <p>Mizuki responded with a nervous smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thus, the wonderful alliance between the two began in a temporary form.</span></p>
