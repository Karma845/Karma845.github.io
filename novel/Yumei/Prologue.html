<h3>Prologue</h3>

<span style="font-size: medium;">What happened to Misaki may be something I will never forget. The day she came to the library&#8212;</span></p><p></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Honestly, at first, I was afraid of her.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Because she and I are diametrically opposed people.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">She is cheerful, indifferent, free-spirited, a native of a bright world that is completely different from mine.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Her bright smile fascinates me, like burning eyes.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">Well. In my heart, she is like the sun.</span></p><p style="text-align: left;"><span style="font-size: medium;">And this was the record of the alliance made with her like that, until it fell apart.</span></p>
