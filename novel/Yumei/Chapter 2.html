<h3>Chapter 2 - Your Allies</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">A few days later Mizuki and Misaki formed an alliance in the form of a temporary contract. July is over, and we are into a typical early August afternoon.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hee~, this is Mizuki-san's house. As the house of two men living with your uncle, isn't it quite clean!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In front of the entrance of Mizuki's house, Misaki's excited voice resounded. Her curious eyes looked inside Mizuki's house curiously. Even though when she was watching a movie, she was dressed like a young woman in a summer resort, but today she was wearing denim shorts and a short-sleeved sweater, which looked quite comfortable for activities.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">By the way, Mizuki's clothes have barely changed since he went to the movies. Due to the experience of being alone for too long, he barely had any personal clothes in sight.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For Mizuki, who had lived with his uncle since the sixth grade of elementary school, it was always strange to hear a girl's voice in his own house. It would be better to say that in the past, just staying at home with girls of the same age would make Mizuki very nervous and feel unable to calm down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, to calm himself down, Mizuki took a deep breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki took a deep breath to catch his breath so as not to be caught by Misaki. As oxygen swirled in his brain, he gradually regained his composure. If so, there must always be a way to survive.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry Misaki-san. Anyway, come to this living room first&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki, who turned to Misaki again, pointed to the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, his voice stopped halfway. The reason was because Misaki, who was supposed to be there earlier, had suddenly disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki looked around suspiciously, and finally found Misaki at the front of the room at the end of the corridor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, what's wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, Mizuki-san. Sorry, but I went inside of my own accord."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's okay, I don't mind this.... Ah, if you want to go to the bathroom, turn a little to the right."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8230;Mizuki-san, suddenly said something like that to a girl a bit. And it's not like that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To Mizuki's slightly too inconsiderate comment, Misaki sighed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I caught a glimpse of this altar at the entrance, so I went in. I always feel a little worried."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, this. These are my grandparents and...my mother"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki stared at the Buddhist altar Misaki pointed at with serious eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, Misaki also looked at the altar with great emotion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is Mizuki-kun's mother&#8230;Is that so?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, what's wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's okay, don't worry. Compared to this, Mizuki-san, can I visit this altar for a bit?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh? Well, it's not impossible..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Misaki's sudden request, Mizuki nodded in confusion and agreed. When high school students go to a friend's house, is it ethical to visit a Buddhist altar? Mizuki really wasn't sure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And just when Mizuki was feeling great, Misaki came into the room and sat in front of the Buddhist altar, quietly clasping her hands together. In Mizuki's eyes, Misaki looked seriously visiting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After visiting the altar for a while, Misaki sighed and prepared to stand in front of the altar.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, at this moment, Misaki's body suddenly started shaking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki sensed the abnormality early, and supported Misaki who was about to fall. Ever since he found out that Misaki was seriously ill, he always kept an eye on Misaki when the two were together, and that helped.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you, Mizuki-san. I'm fine now. I was just a little dizzy because I suddenly stood up."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. But don't push yourself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Nodding at Mizuki who looked worried, Misaki leaned on her feet and stood firm. And this time there was no more shaking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, thank you for allowing me to visit your Buddhist altar. Sorry for making such a strange request all of a sudden."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It does not matter. I prefer to say thank you. My grandparents and mother, I think they will be very happy&#8230;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Would you be happy? If only that were true. Alright, let's go over here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Walk out of the room where the Buddhist altar is placed and walk towards the living room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki walked in front of Misaki, and as expected, he still found it very inconceivable that she would appear at his house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, why did Misaki come to the house?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The answer goes back to yesterday afternoon&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mizuki-san. May I come to your house tomorrow?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Hah?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki said this suddenly. It happened during a break between behind-the-scenes work and the two of them having lunch together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing Misaki enter such a sentence in the same tone as usual, Mizuki was stunned for a while, and finally tilted his head in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah? Sorry, didn't you hear? I asked if I could come over to your house tomorrow..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Mizuki's silence, Misaki said again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So it seems that what she said just now wasn't Mizuki's misunderstanding. After confirming that his ears and brain were in normal condition, Mizuki heaved a sigh of relief in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, now was not the time to calm down. Because it's not that I heard wrong, then this is also a problem.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki looked at Misaki, who was casually stuffing Tamagoyaki into her mouth, with eyes mixed with reproach.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, this kind of thing doesn't work in general. What do you think about a pretty girl running into the house of an unknown man like me? Misaki-san, you idiot. If there was an emergency, what would you do? Please think before you speak."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Well, I really didn't expect you to have such a strong reaction. You're so humble that I don't want to tease you with "Are you trying to do something?" Mizuki-san, if you're like this, you'll never marry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I still know that. It's clearer. Everything will be fine. Compared to this, what was your intention when you said you wanted to come to my house?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I didn't plan anything. I just wanted to try it out as a temporary alliance activity&#8230; Could there be something else?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki, who was stunned, asked back, Mizuki's aura disappeared in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki thought with a calm mind as if cold water had been poured on him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even so, the reason why Misaki wanted to come to Mizuki's house could only be based on an alliance. "May I go to your house?" Shocked by the power of those words, Mizuki had completely lost himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Sorry. The impact was a bit too strong and I messed up."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, you better be honest. Well, I was a little too abrupt, so this time it'll be balanced."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Mizuki express his feelings after contemplating, Misaki said "I'm sorry" in a relaxed tone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Starting with this, Misaki spoke again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I want to go to Mizuki-san's house because I want to say something that I don't want to talk about outside. Although it's fine to come to my house, but my mother is there, Mizuki-san, it's hard for you to come. So even though I'm shy, I just want to use your house. Come on, didn't you say that you basically live alone?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, my uncle is still overseas right now, so it's fine to provide you with somewhere... ...But, "what do you not want to say outside", what exactly do you want to say?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki asked Misaki with questioning eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As for the alliance, Misaki took him at the cafe on the street. He didn't want to say it outside, what kind of thing was that?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even though we've become a temporary alliance, we still don't know anything about each other, right? So, I want Mizuki-san to hear about my personal business. What did I do before I transferred to this high school."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmmmm."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then, this is the end of my request before I leave. But, isn't it embarrassing to talk about my privacy? So I don't want others to hear about it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I totally understand your thoughts."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's scary just thinking about talking about your privacy without knowing who's listening. Mizuki also agreed from the bottom of his heart, this was indeed something she didn't want to say on the outside.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah? But, may I say no here? No one will ever come to this library, and it can basically be considered a private space."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"In that case, I think I'm very interested in Mizuki-san's house,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">said Misaki excitedly for some reason.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki didn't know exactly what had driven Misaki's interest to that point.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even if you say you're interested, it's just an ordinary family with a few years of age? Well, like I said before, it's fine if it's provided as an event venue for you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you. Then, the place has been decided to be Mizuki-san's home. Also, if possible, if Mizuki can share your privacy with me, I would be very happy. I also want to know more about Mizuki-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"My personal business? My past isn't interesting even if you hear about it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even if it's boring, it's fine. As long as I know Mizuki-kun's past, I'm already very satisfied!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki pointed at the tip of Mizuki's nose with her index finger, as if to say "This is important here".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Would you like to try the alliance testing activity?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki asked Mizuki and looked into his eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki's past before coming to this high school. It would be a lie to say that there is no interest. And if it was for Misaki, Mizuki didn't refuse to tell his past. From the content point of view, testing activities as an alliance are also perfect.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I agree with your proposal. Let's do it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really! This is good. Since it seems like Mizuki-san has a lot of dark history, I'm afraid you'll reject it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8230;You, I always have to talk like that. This is not black history. However, as I said earlier, it's not an interesting story."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki looked helplessly at Misaki, who was relieved.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, there was no anger in his eyes. It was normal for Misaki to behave a little out of line, but Mizuki himself wasn't much better, so it was a counterbalance. Not something to be angry about.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And more than that, for Mizuki, it made him happier because Misaki could feel at ease.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although there were some twists and turns, the content of the temporary alliance's water testing activities was decided this way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">~</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll make you a cup of tea, you can sit down."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mmm. Thank you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki led Misaki into the living room and headed straight for the kitchen. Since Misaki came as a guest, she prepared some expensive tea leaves beforehand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Mizuki made tea and returned to the living room, Misaki looked at the glass cabinet near the wall with interest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, Mizuki-san. It's a harmonica, right? It's yours? Can you play it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki asked hopefully.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki refers to the harmonica box that is kept in the cupboard. It seemed to have been discovered when Mizuki went to make tea.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. It's mine. I know how to play. Don't look at me like this. I've been training for almost ten years."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki took out a box from the cupboard and opened it for Misaki. The harmonica lying inside shimmered in the sunlight that was pouring into the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, Misaki made an even more excited voice, "Amazing! This is my first time seeing a real harmonica".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You can play it. Flowing from the harmonica is a melody woven by a very clear sound. This pleasant tone is definitely not something that can be produced with a little practice. Ten years of not exploding. After Mizuki finished playing a song, this time it was Misaki's turn to fill the room with selfless applause.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Awesome, so amazing! Mizuki-san, you really know how to play. I don't know much about music, so I can't really put it into words, but the voice is really good!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If it makes you feel good, I'm very happy too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Misaki who was full of praise, Mizuki timidly thanked her, and carefully put the harmonica back into the cupboard. Perhaps because of Misaki's unabashed praise, his face turned red.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"However, I'm still surprised. After all, Mizuki-san, you seem to have completely lost touch with the instrument. Why did you start playing the harmonica?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This was taught by my dead mother."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki said with a hint of emotion in the past.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At that moment, Misaki's expression turned gloomy, but Mizuki, who was staring blankly into the distance, didn't notice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was the only thing that tender mother left for Mizuki. That's the harmonica.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Mizuki was an elementary school student, having his mother teach him how to play the harmonica was a great joy every day. For Mizuki, playing the harmonica with his mother was something special.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki looked at the harmonica in the cupboard again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This harmonica was bought by his mother when he was ten years old. Mizuki's name is also engraved on the metal case, which is a specially customized item. To Mizuki, it was also an important treasure that connected him and his mother to this day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then let's stop talking about harmonica. It's almost time to get to the point. If it continues like this, it will be dark."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Come on!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Urged by Mizuki, Misaki nodded with a relaxed expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Sitting on the chair that Mizuki had prepared, Misaki took out two A4 sized notebooks from her bag and placed one of them in front.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki, who was sitting opposite Misaki as usual, stared at the notebook on the table in disbelief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, what notebook is this?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Didn't I say it yesterday? I want to talk about the past and fulfill a wish before leaving. I want to write my history as a 'dying diary'. Despite everything until now, I still want to live my life. Each day is well preserved in its original form... Today, I think it is enough to lay the foundation for a diary."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see, 'dying diary'..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So, this notebook is used as a diary. Since I only bought a set of five copies, I also gave one to Mizuki-san. I'll be using it instead of a notebook."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After hearing Misaki's words, Mizuki held the notebook in his hand and stared intently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A dying diary is a "living diary" that describes one's hopes for those left behind. There are no specific rules for its form, except for what Misaki says about her own history, usually there are written wishes for medicine, funerals, etc.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No wonder Misaki, who had been told by the doctor that her time was running out, wanted to write this. Today, I must recount my past while summarizing the main points of my history.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki, who already understood the meaning of the notebook, lowered his head towards Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Since you prepared it for me, it would be rude of me to refuse, so let me use it. Thank you, Misaki-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay. After all, I think it's good that the notebook I bought wasn't wasted.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki showed an expression that saw through the red dust.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Misaki's smile, Mizuki felt a pain like a small thorn root in his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki had seen such a smile in the past.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But the owner of that smile disappeared in front of his eyes two years ago. And Misaki will also disappear in front of his eyes one day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Mizuki spoke quickly so as not to relive the pain he felt personally.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So, what should we do next? Talk to each other about your past and write a diary of Misaki-san's death. Which will you do first?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think it's better to write your own history in a notebook first and then talk about it. That way, the content of the conversation can be concluded well. What do you think, Mizuki-san?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay. I'm not good at improvising, so I want to set the main points first."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay. Summarizing time is um-- until three o'clock. Then let's get started!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki pointed to the 1:40 clock wall minute clapping as a sign to start.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">One hour and twenty minutes. Longer than high school class. And to sum up what you said, it will suffice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki took out her mechanical pencil from the pencil case, Mizuki took out his mechanical pencil from the bookshelf and started writing in the notebook.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Black pencil lines started crossing the clean notebook, and words appeared one after another.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki carefully divided the projects according to the students of childhood, elementary school, middle school, and high school, and wrote down the most memorable things in each period's memory one by one.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Before he started writing, Mizuki sensed the danger of the shallowness of his life, and was even worried that he would write everything down in five minutes, but his worries seemed unnecessary. Once I started writing in my notebook, the memories I had accumulated in my life so far, from sad and sad things to happy and joyful memories, came one after another.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I initially thought it was a shallow and boring life, but just a little digging would bring back a lot of memories. In the process of filling the notebook with words, Mizuki actually realized that the person who hated his past the most was himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In this way, Mizuki started to worry whether there would be enough time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki glanced at the time several times as the pen explored the notebook. From time to time, he suddenly looked at Misaki, who was sitting across from him, and she was also writing fluently in a notebook.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's been almost a month since I met Misaki. If you think about it again, you will find that I was never heard her talk about her past.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">During lunch or chatting between work behind the scenes, Misaki was always asking Mizuki questions, and she was in a position to listen. For Mizuki, who wasn't used to talking to girls, he wasn't calm enough to wonder about it. However, now that I think about it, Misaki must have been deliberately avoiding topics that involve her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki was like that saying she wanted to tell her past.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What kind of life has she been through?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though he felt that she had bad taste, Mizuki couldn't help but be curious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What up?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seemingly aware that she was being stared at, Misaki's eyes suddenly shifted from the notebook to Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sudden shock and guilt for peeking at other people made Mizuki's heart skip a beat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, no&#8230; it's fine..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't tell me, your summary is finished? Mizuki-san is very fast. But sorry, I haven't finished it yet, please wait for me"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I haven't finished writing either, so please don't worry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so? It's better to respect than obey."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki smiled, and started writing in the notebook again with a serious face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can't bother Misaki anymore. Mizuki also regained his spirits and started the summarizing work.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki and Misaki enjoyed brewed tea and madeleine during snack time, giving their brains and hands a good rest.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">(Note: Madeleine cakes are small French desserts, also known as shell cakes).</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Madeleine was bought by Misaki as a thank you gift to Mizuki for providing a place for her. As she said, the cake seemed to be the product of a famous shop that was frequently introduced in magazines. It is said that this dessert is made with care by a first-class pastry chef who has studied abroad, and is very different from other Madeleines....</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry Misaki-san. Even though this cake is delicious, I really don't understand how it tastes different from other cakes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't worry Mizuki-san. Even though I'm telling the truth, I actually don't understand it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For Mizuki and Misaki who don't have great taste buds, they know nothing but delicious food.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">They both felt inexplicably amused, "What exactly are you doing?";"Yes" and laughed together. It was quite a new feeling for Mizuki to be so happy just by eating snacks together like this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, after a break, the two also returned to the main topic. Placing the notebook with each other's history in the center of the table, the foreheads of the two would touch, and they looked at the notebook together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...I said it, Mizuki-san"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...What's wrong, Misaki-san"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If I finish all this... Maybe tonight"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Coincidence. I'm thinking the same thing right now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Both notebooks are filled with pages of their own history. The density of each page is quite high. While it is successful in the sense of writing its own history, it is clearly a failure in the sense of summarizing the main points. Both of them are so addicted to writing their own diaries that they can't stop.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing the masterpieces made by each other, the two laughed in unison again after eating Madeleine's cake.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There is no point in keeping a diary in the first place."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Our life is not shallow. Just knowing this means a lot, doesn't it?&#8212;Yeah. I was so surprised that there was so much to write about."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Mizuki shrugging, Misaki agreed "me too".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"However, I have already sorted out what I wrote, so I can only talk about the things that are necessary. How about you, Mizuki-san?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I have no problem. Then who will speak first?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then the one who lost in Janken will say it first"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay. Come on then."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The result was Mizuki's defeat. So Mizuki said it first, and then went to Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then, although it may sound relatively simple, I'll start talking about myself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay, please."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki lowered her head gently in a rare serious tone. That means from now on, let's get serious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki felt a little nervous when he saw Misaki straining her ears earnestly to listen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was Mizuki's first time telling anyone about his past. He looked at the notebook again, and wet his lips with his tongue as he stared at the article written on it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, Mizuki looked at Misaki, who was waiting for him to speak, and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"My earliest memory is of my father's funeral. He died in a traffic accident when I was five years old,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki said about his childhood.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki, who lost his father at a young age, is not good at socializing with his friends. He will hide from the children who are happy to tell funny stories about his time with his father. Now that I think about it, it was probably due to jealousy and jealousy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"However, my mother used the harmonica to save me from self-isolation."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My mother always played the harmonica for Mizuki who was alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is said that playing the harmonica was originally my father's hobby. Later, under my father's influence, my mother also started playing the harmonica, which my father seemed to have taught me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is my father's tone, and my father lives on this tone."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My mother always smiled and said this to Mizuki when she was playing the harmonica.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So whenever Mizuki heard his mother's harmonica, he could forget the loneliness that his father was no longer in this world.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"My mother started teaching me to play the harmonica when I was in elementary school. She told me, 'Inherit your father's tone'. After that, I still wasn't good at socializing with people, but because I could play the harmonica. I became more active. The relationship with my classmates is gradually becoming harmonious."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki's world becomes wider under harmonica music. This music is passed down from father to mother, and then from mother to himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As the world develops, the once miserable collective life of the school can gradually become more pleasant. After school, I often played out with my friends, and school activities, apart from marathons, no longer made people feel depressed. After advancing to senior year, Mizuki also works hard to participate in club activities, and sings the seemingly short elementary school life but is actually long to his heart's content.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;Well, because of my mother's support, I also live a normal school life. By the way, the club activity is a music club. Since I can play the harmonica, it's quite popular."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see. Mizuki-san, when you were in elementary school..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you say that, it really is.... In a sense, it was probably the most glorious period of my life."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Misaki's accusation, Mizuki nodded with a feeling of reality.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki felt there was a hierarchy even in elementary school, but for boys who were still mentally young, they didn't really care. So Mizuki could also use his harmonica skill as a weapon to make himself look more or less shiny.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, the worst turning point in Mizuki's life ruined all those glorious days.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then, in the winter of my sixth grade, my mother had a heart attack&#8230;. At that moment, I literally felt like the whole world was collapsing from under my feet."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though I had tried my best to keep his words from being too heavy, Mizuki still couldn't hide his feelings. When talking about his mother's illness, Mizuki's expression showed helplessness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The mother who had been his spiritual support suddenly became seriously ill. Mizuki still remembered what the doctor had said, "If you don't do a heart transplant, I can't guarantee that you can survive for five years."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When he heard the news with his uncle back then, Mizuki cursed fate seriously. Why a mother, why do you want to take someone important to me?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This feeling still lingers in Mizuki's heart to this day. Even though he had given up the matter of his mother's death, he still couldn't accept it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So listening to Mizuki's story, Misaki's expression clouded over. I'm afraid Mizuki's gloomy expression has spread. I'm really sorry for Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, since we will be talking about the past, it is inevitable to mention these things.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"After my mother was hospitalized, as the uncle of my mother's younger brother, he adopted me and started living in this family. I lived my life back and forth between school and hospital in middle school for half a year, my uncle often worked because of work. He went overseas, so I'm in the semi-alone state I'm in right now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Go to school, go to the hospital to take care of my mother after class, repeat every day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Having no time to care about his interactions with people, Mizuki becomes alone at school again. And staying at home at the moment, he went to a middle school in another school district, which was probably one of the reasons why Mizuki was alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki didn't feel lonely because he wasn't alone. Time spent with my mother was more important than making friends and playing with friends at school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thinking about it now, Mizuki probably already had an inkling in his heart about the impending separation from his mother.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then, about three years after the onset of the illness, in the winter of my third year in middle school, my mother died."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the end, the mother completely failed to survive for five years, doctors said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That day - the day his mother left, clearly reappeared in Mizuki's mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There is no silent approach, and no signs, such as natural disasters. This is Mizuki's concept of "death".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">During lunch break as usual, Mizuki was suddenly called by the homeroom teacher and answered the phone call at the office.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The call was from the hospital, and the hospitalized mother's condition was deteriorating.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After hanging up the phone, Mizuki couldn't remember exactly how he got to the hospital. When he regained consciousness, he and the homeroom looked at the hospital where his mother was hospitalized.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The moment he entered the hospital, Mizuki flew alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki rushed to the ward, where the doctors and nurses who were treating were all surrounded by his mother's bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When he finally came to bed, his mother was gone. Mizuki still remembered that the only thing that echoed in the ward was the cold electronic sound of the medical equipment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki held his mother's hand blankly, her hands still warm and soft.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, the warmth and tenderness that gradually disappeared from that body made Mizuki clearly aware of his mother's death. Later, when his mother's temperature disappeared, Mizuki accepted the fact that his mother had died.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The regret of that moment flashed through my mind in an instant. Mizuki couldn't help but lower his&nbsp;head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, sitting in front of the hunched Mizuki, Misaki also wet her eyes with sadness and bit her lips tightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"-Sorry. I'm depressed myself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki raised his&nbsp;head with a forced smile and looked at Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this time, Misaki also returned to her usual expression and shook her head "No".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I just wanted to apologize to you. It reminds you of those painful things."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There's no need to worry about that. After all, I decided to say it. Besides, it's not all sad. There's also a chance to cheer me up."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8230;A chance to cheer up?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking at the confused Misaki, Mizuki smiled and nodded in agreement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It was at my mother's funeral"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki reflected on the important past that made him what he is today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There were many condolences at my mother's funeral, mourning her untimely death.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Through conversations with many condolences, Mizuki finds out about a mother he doesn't know. And among these things, what surprised Mizuki the most was that in an unknown place, the mother was the one who spoiled his&nbsp;children the most.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Whenever you get good grades in school, your mother will happily brag about you. Even when I went to see your mother, she still said the same thing, I could hear it in my ears."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. And Mizuki, haven't you helped a girl at the hospital before? Your mother was so happy that she even sent me an email."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The one who said these words was his&nbsp;mother's friend whom even Mizuki had met several times. And their words also made most of the condolences present show nostalgic smiles.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's right"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Your mother's ability to witness your growth is her greatest survival value."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Everyone agrees.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki was very surprised, and at the same time he was a little embarrassed. He couldn't help but smile wryly at the acquaintance who had listened to his mother's hilarious anecdote about showing off her son, and then added, "I'm really sorry that my mother gave you trouble." But even so, Mizuki showed a smile for the first time since losing his&nbsp;mother.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The trauma of losing a mother cannot be healed. Sadness overflows in the heart, and flows against the river.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But even so, now there was a person in front of me who was the same as me, crying at the memory of my mother. There was someone who missed the days spent with his mother and told Mizuki his story. Seeing them, Mizuki's heart healed slightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Death does not approach quietly, and there is no sign of it, like a natural disaster. Then unplug the important stuff. However, after close relatives were taken away, it wasn't that nothing was left behind, the seeds he sown called "lost" took root in the heart of the bereaved. Of course, Mizuki felt the same way...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">His mother's funeral also taught Mizuki these things.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of that, Mizuki vowed to cherish the longing for his&nbsp;mother that had taken root in his&nbsp;heart. I vowed to live a life that would make my mother proud.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;So, with such determination, I found out what I could do and continued on to high school. I started working behind the scenes on the library committee which I occasionally joined. That way, I could also help teachers and other library committees. My mother should be happy too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see. &#8212;&#8212;Mizuki-san, you really are amazing. It's just a trivial matter, but the Spirit of Heaven will definitely be happy for you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thanks. Well, that's the only thing I still don't have friends with. I'm wondering if it worries my parents in heaven."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's right! I think Mizuki-san should be more interested in the people around you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah&#8230; I will work hard in the future."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After being heavily praised and criticized, Mizuki smiled shyly and scratched his&nbsp;face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, let's put aside the fact that I don't have any friends. When I was busy working behind the scenes like this, I was discovered and captured by you, Misaki-san, that's why I am today. You're like a hunter..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki's outrageous statement made Misaki a little embarrassed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Mizuki said "Sorry", he continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But, Misaki-san, I'm very lucky that you found me. Otherwise, I might not be able to make friends until I graduate. Thank you Misaki-san for talking to me. Thank you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki smiled and thanked her, Misaki blushed and looked away. Maybe she wasn't used to receiving other people's thanks like this. Her movements were very cute, which made Mizuki's heart beat faster. By the way, he also felt a little embarrassed for saying something inappropriate for himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you so much for listening."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki cleared his&nbsp;throat as if to cover up the past, Mizuki ended the session. Although he felt a little smooth in the end, he was relieved that he had finished his work.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then it's your turn, Misaki-san. Can you do it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To calm himself, he took a deep breath, then immediately tightened his expression and adjusted his posture.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tell me how you got to where I am today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki's clear voice echoed in the silent room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I said before that I didn't go to school because I was sick from my last year of elementary school until I transferred to high school at this time. Otherwise, I can't go to school."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Can't go to school? It is because......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki sensed what Misaki wanted to say, and urged her to continue.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki nodded at Mizuki and continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well. In the early spring of this year, the doctor told me that my time was running out, and I had been in the hospital until then"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hospitalized due to illness. Words that didn't fit in with the free-spirited Misaki's daily life dissolved in the air of the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"May I ask, what disease is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course. Hmm&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki asked, so Misaki told him the exact name of the illness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, so far Mizuki had never heard of this disease in his life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Since the cases are so few, it's normal that you don't know. Well, roughly speaking, it was heart disease."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Heart disease&#8230;."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, and that's pretty serious. I will be hospitalized soon."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Mizuki react to the word heart disease, Misaki had to smile bitterly. Then she went on to tell the story of her childhood.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki had been hospitalized since the fifth grade of elementary school, and it seemed that she had spent almost six years in the hospital after that. Because they are unable to attend school, compulsory education also ends at the school level, and high school is a high school with a communication system.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"At first, my elementary school friends would visit me, but because my hospitalization became a unit year after year, they really haven't come back... After I was promoted to middle school, I have no friends."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Like Mizuki-san," Misaki said with a wry smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Mizuki didn't know how to answer that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki was left alone because he prioritized his mother over friends. In other words, this was a choice made by Mizuki himself, and it was a choice he made himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Misaki was different. She was left alone because of her illness, which had nothing to do with her own will. Mizuki couldn't imagine what kind of mood Misaki would feel when she was alone in the ward as she gradually distanced herself from her friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, at the same time, Mizuki didn't want to curse her classmates who had gradually stopped visiting Misaki. Mizuki, who had rushed to the hospital to take care of his&nbsp;mother, knew how heavy a burden it was for elementary and middle school students.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Nothing is wrong. However, because of this, when I think about Misaki's mood, I feel even more uncomfortable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It would be great if I could say something clever, but I really don't know what to say."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the end, Mizuki still couldn't figure out what to say to Misaki, and was full of his&nbsp;own helplessness and lowered his&nbsp;head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Misaki smiled gently at Mizuki who couldn't do anything about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No need to apologize. You don't need to say words of consolation here, but you have a higher rank in my heart. As expected of Mizuki-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Misaki-san, you are really strong. Even though you have endured the pain and sorrow, you still haven't lost your cheerfulness and tenderness. Really, I really respect you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki couldn't help but think that if it was himself, I'm afraid I couldn't become like that. Misaki. You will inevitably lament your sick self, focus all your energy on yourself, and completely forget about caring for others.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Misaki didn't become like that. There was no doubt that this was Misaki's own strength. Like those words, Mizuki admired her from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, facing Mizuki who admired her so much, Misaki smiled and shook her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you. But, the reason why I survived without losing my joy wasn't because of how strong I was. It was because there was one person who became my spiritual support, and I am where I am today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What kind of person is that person?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What kind of person could make Misaki praise this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki who was a bit worried asked aimlessly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, Misaki suddenly took out a notebook from her bag, opened it, and took out the photo inside and handed it to Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The helper who saved me&#8212;it was Mizuki-san, your mother."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Eh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Misaki's unexpected answer, Mizuki looked at the photo she gave him in surprise. In the photo, Misaki and his&nbsp;mother are indeed a bit younger than they are now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki was surprised by the unexpected relationship between his&nbsp;mother and Misaki, Misaki continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"After I was admitted to the hospital, my mother, father, doctors and nurses were all very kind to me. They always care about me to make me fight against the disease. Although I was very happy about this incident, I was also quite lonely. I feel like I'm constantly surrounded by a thick barrier..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm sick myself, and it's the people around me who care. Both are located on either side of a clearly demarcated line. To Misaki, it was a thick barrier that couldn't be crossed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The kindness of the people around her makes Misaki even more lonely.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So I lost a friend and started to fear relationships. In order not to deepen the thick barrier, I always smile. In order not to make it difficult for my parents and doctors, I tried my best to play as a reasonable person."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was actually really scared that everyone would leave me," Misaki said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While always being cared for, Misaki must constantly care for others in turn. So as not to trouble others. So as not to burden yourself. Perhaps influenced by this thought, Misaki always paid attention to her words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Misaki had been more selfish, maybe she wouldn't be bothered by the relationships around her. However, Misaki couldn't do it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Back then, I met Mizuki-san's mother, Yoko-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After speaking, Misaki's mouth twitched upwards.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki and Mizuki's mother met when she was about thirteen years old. She was sitting on a bench in the hospital atrium, and suddenly, Mizuki's mother came to speak.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The weather is nice. If the weather is really nice, it should be comfortable for jogging in the park or something. Well, if I did something like that, my heart would probably stop beating."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki's mother opened it with a joke that made people not laugh at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mother was indeed a rather natural person, but even in places Mizuki didn't know, she seemed to explode for others to see. Mizuki felt a headache from his&nbsp;own ugliness, and lowered his&nbsp;head towards Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...I'm really sorry that my mother suddenly said something rude to you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No need to apologize. Well, but I was really surprised when she suddenly spoke to me. But, I tried talking to her. After a while, it couldn't be explained in harmony. When I came to my senses, we had been chatting for more than two hours, and I was scolded by the female nurse who came to me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki said with full of emotion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Back then, it really had been a long time since I laughed from my heart."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Taking that day's conversation as an opportunity, the two began to communicate.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Since Yoko-san and I have the same heart disease, only she doesn't really care about me and treats me naturally. I am very happy. Since I was able to do it in front of Yoko-san too, I was able to return to my true self. Thanks to her, I didn't lose myself either."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki recalled the scene back then, her voice full of excitement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing her like this, Mizuki thought. The meeting with his&nbsp;mother heals Misaki's heart, who laments her loneliness. The mother saves the lonely girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No, I'm afraid that my own mother was saved by Misaki's existence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The great things a mother has accomplished is something to be proud of. In addition, Mizuki was very relieved to know that the sick mother had someone to share her problems with, and most importantly, Misaki's heart was redeemed, which made Mizuki more than happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Misaki's expression suddenly darkened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So, when Yoko-san left, I was very sad&#8230; Maybe a little too sad to be sad in front of Mizuki-san, but Yoko-san was my savior."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The voice just fell, Misaki's tears started to fall.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this moment, Mizuki finally understood.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Why would Misaki want to pay homage to her mother's altar? Why is Misaki so sad when Mizuki talks about his&nbsp;mother's illness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was because Misaki herself had special feelings for his&nbsp;mother.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, you don't have to worry so much about me. I don't know what's going on, how did that happen?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki gave a paper box to Misaki, whose face was filled with tears, and smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki still admires Mizuki's mother and mourns her death. How could it be said that her mood wasn't as good as Mizuki's.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Perhaps Misaki-san chose this place as her activity site because you thought would my mother's Buddhist altar be here?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, I do think so. I'm lucky."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki wiped her tears with a tissue.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing that, Mizuki's heart became hot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, you made a special trip to see my mother, she must be very happy too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki said his&nbsp;most sincere words of gratitude, and Misaki smiled, "Yes!" and nodded in agreement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Besides, Misaki-san, you've been in that hospital the whole time, I didn't even know it. It really surprised me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;&#8212;Ah&#8212;hmm. I see. Eh&#8230;--As expected, it's like that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, the moment Mizuki said that, Misaki's expression suddenly became indescribable. If I had to say it, it was a very "subtle" feeling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looks like Mizuki said something inappropriate again. It's a shame, but he has absolutely no idea where he's messing up....</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah...that. Could it be that Misaki-san knew me when I was hospitalized?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, after all, I've seen you often come to visit Yoko-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki asked while thinking about how to change the atmosphere. Misaki answered with a gentle smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was clear that she was smiling, but Misaki was currently having an inexplicable sense of compulsion. Sure enough, he still said something that made Misaki angry. Mizuki felt a chill run down his spine, and unpleasant sweat slowly began to flow out from his forehead.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing this, Misaki burst out laughing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry sorry. I just wanted to tease you. I'm joking, don't be afraid,"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki laughed loudly. Looks like he's being duped.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So now that I say this, the rest is easy to understand. At the end of February this year, after I was told that my time was running out, I was forced to ask the treating doctor to get me out of the hospital. Then I passed the high school transfer exam and managed to enter the school until today. Going to a regular high school was also my wish before I left."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's only high school."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What is taken for granted by oneself is not taken for granted by others. Misaki's words made Mizuki know this reality again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, I transferred to this high school because Mizuki-san, you're here. I heard from Yoko-san about your entrance exam, so I thought I might be able to meet you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"In other words, before you transferred to my high school, did you think of me as an ally?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Those are two different things. However, whether it's the reason to choose Mizuki-san as an ally, or to transfer to Mizuki-san's school, I can't tell you right now"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki asked and Misaki just smiled mischievously and deviated from the answer. For some reason, Mizuki felt it was better not to ask anymore, and replied curtly, "I see.".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, let's put the reason for the transfer aside. I'll talk about my past first. So do you have any questions?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well&#8230; then it's better to respect than obey. Can I ask you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay. Ask a few more questions."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, what else do you want to do before you leave?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"First of all, thanks to my parents. Say 'Thank you for always loving me so much.' And the second is travel. But this wish has come true. After I was discharged from the hospital, my family took me for a walk. It was my first time going to a hot spring or something since I got sick. It was really relaxing. ...So I'm naturally grateful to my parents."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Go for a walk, then thank you. ...Well, I feel it's like Misaki-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you. But the trip was very pleasant. Mizuki-san, you know? The hot springs are completely different from normal baths. They warm the body deep inside. Also, the food at the hotel is delicious. As expected, it's not worth the food at hospital!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was the joy of traveling back, Misaki couldn't help but smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And I don't know if that's not enough to talk about it, Misaki takes her cell phone out of her things and shows Mizuki the photos of her trip.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Look at Mizuki-san. Over here! The night view here is so beautiful. It looks like a treasure box. Really, Mizuki-san, you should definitely see it too! The red bean dumplings in the next picture are amazing too. What! I could eat five skewers! And then, this photo is of the aquarium! We left the next day. Why are penguins so cute? I feel so much better just watching them take a walk." (Note: most dumplings in Japan are skewered with bamboo skewers)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki kept scrolling through the photos, happily recounting the memories in each photo. Her emotions seemed to be so high that she wanted to say something but was too impatient to finish it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, while listening to Misaki's story, Mizuki made a decision.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Listening to Misaki's past so far, and seeing the smile on Misaki's face, he thought so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki knew that Misaki was indeed hiding something from him. But even putting that part aside, he wanted Misaki to smile like that until the end.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, as long as it was still in his power, he was willing to help. The girl who was in the same situation as his&nbsp;mother and became his&nbsp;mother's redemption. If he could become her backer, there was nothing more satisfying in this world than this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of that, Mizuki said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, I've made up my mind."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah? What was decided?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I officially accept the alliance you proposed, Misaki-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki suddenly raised her head from her cellphone and looked straight at Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Receiving his gaze, Mizuki clearly nodded in agreement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, you wish to end your wish before you leave, and I will accompany you until the end of time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Will you stay with me until the end.... Are you really saying that? After all, I have a lot of things I want to do, so I'm going to make you walk around. After all, one of my wishes is to "have a good time". "</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That suits me. I will accompany you to the end."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To Misaki who spoke provocatively, Mizuki answered with a bold attitude.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki probably didn't expect Mizuki to give such a reliable answer. She put away her courage and widened her eyes in surprise. However, she immediately showed a natural smile and said happily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then I'll let you stay with me for a while."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay. Anything can be discussed. &#8212;&#8212;Ah, but it's a bit difficult for me to stand in a place where there are too many people, if you can be a little sympathetic about this. I'd be very happy if I saw it.&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, I see. Leave it to me"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you. By the way, where does Misaki-san want to go?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That&#8230; went to a cat cafe, went to a sports game, went to the planetarium at the science museum, and&#8230;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Isn't this all a bustling place! I beg you to be merciful?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki groaned at Misaki, who was counting on her fingers. Just a minute after the alliance was established, Mizuki felt uneasy about the future.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, there's more. Actually, before I left, there was something else in my wish that was 'to challenge something I never thought of'. Then I'll leave this to Mizuki-san. Think about yourself If there's something you want to try", then take me to do it. I hope you can find something I can't imagine, really unexpected!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, even if you tell me 'I'll leave it to you'&#8230;&#8230; I'm basically just squatting at home, and I have nothing to do outside&#8230;&#8230;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Misaki's request, Mizuki answered within two seconds. This is a completely irrelevant answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other hand, Misaki sighed heavily, "This friendless person is really...".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mizuki-san, think of this as practice for dating girls in the future. You make your own plans, and then accompany me, who is the object of the training. That's the kind of practice."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wait. This is too difficult for me. Besides, it's impossible for me to date a girl in the future."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Who knew this kind of thing. Even Mizuki-san might fall in love with someone. After all, someone who fell in love with Mizuki-san might have already appeared!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter what Mizuki said, Misaki just insisted on saying "Do it!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At a time like that, Misaki would never give up. In other words, Mizuki had no chance of winning. So Mizuki raised his&nbsp;hand in surrender.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll think about it. Please give me some time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. Okay! I'm looking forward to it, Mizuki-san!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After making an appointment with Mizuki, Misaki nodded in satisfaction.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki had a dream.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's a ward somewhere. Season - maybe summer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki, like last time, was looking out the window from inside this ward through someone's eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's sunny outside. The midsummer sky was blue everywhere, and white clouds drifted slowly in the sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, the heavy and painful feeling in Mizuki's heart was like rain, befitting that sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even with life-prolonging treatment, his disappearance was bound to come to an end. What's the point of lying in bed like this and waiting to die in vain? You clearly have something you want to do, so why waste this meaningless time?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite being eroded by the overwhelming sense of nothingness, this person continued to ask and answer his own questions in a heart that was piling up anxiety.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki felt this anxiety and thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki didn't know whose consciousness this was. But even so, for some reason he couldn't let go. He wanted to extend his hand to that person&#8212;&#8212;.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, even the hand he wanted to extend couldn't move, and the sights Mizuki saw and the voices he heard in his mind gradually faded away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Firework-"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki in yukata sat by the river and shouted happily at the huge fireworks blooming in the night sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the last Saturday of summer vacation, Mizuki and Misaki came to the local fireworks display. And this is also an alliance event held as one of Misaki's wishes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since it was a fireworks display after a few years, Misaki was wearing a hydrangea patterned yukata and geta, so she could fully enjoy the fireworks. The Japanese-style dress that debuted was perfect for her slender figure.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other hand, Mizuki who didn't have fashionable things like a yukata was wearing a plain T-shirt and jeans.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mizuki-san, why don't we shout together too! The fireworks&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, fireworks&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">(Note: Two people here call Tamaya and Tamaya, both of which were famous fireworks in the Edo era. Japanese people would shout these two sentences when watching fireworks)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki patted Mizuki shoulder for urging, Mizuki was also half embarrassed, and half shouting with joy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was just that his voice was suddenly drowned out by the laughter and laughter of the other guests who were watching the fireworks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After the last ten bursts of fireworks, loud cheers and applause surrounded the river. Hearing these voices, Mizuki felt the joy of living an extraordinary life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then... It's almost time for us to return. If it's too late, Misaki-san's parents will be worried."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Um!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Amidst the flow of people on their way home, Mizuki and the others started their journey home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't know if it's because she's enjoying the fireworks, Misaki smiled. Seeing her bright smile, Mizuki recalled what had happened during the past month.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After talking to each other about the past, Mizuki was taken to various places by Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To be honest, Misaki is so active that one wonders if she's really running out of time. However, on the other hand, it could be said that she desperately wanted to live a beautiful life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">During the library's opening day, the two will concentrate on behind-the-scenes work at school, and planning their trip. This is a common style.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Misaki herself said, her wishes were indeed diverse. These were all experiences that Mizuki didn't want to try and wouldn't try if he was alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Cat cafe or something that just doesn't suit me. Just watch sports at home. Even if you don't go to the planetarium, if you want to see the stars, just look up. The same goes for all sorts of other things.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since I was alone, I thought this way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, after doing so, I found that these things were unexpectedly happy. Touching an animal can be incredibly healing, and going to a live sporting event can leave your palms sweating with excitement. The planetarium is very touching.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When she was discussing alliances, Misaki said "I don't want an unfair alliance that only benefits me", but that's what she said. Perhaps Misaki was planning to benefit him in other ways, but that was enough for now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And, after going through a lot, for Mizuki, the time he spent with Misaki was irreplaceable. To allow myself to face a world I've never understood before, it takes time like this&#8212;&#8212;.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Mizuki was walking on the street looking back on summer vacation, Misaki suddenly stopped.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, what's wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah&#8230;haha. Sorry, I'm not used to using geta, my feet hurt a little."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki replied with a shy smile. Taking a closer look, her right leg was scratched by the plug and was bleeding a little.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, but it's okay. If it doesn't work, I'll let go of the geta and walk!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you do, your leg will hurt. Please don't do this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki grabbed Misaki who was about to walk with geta in her hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He walked straight towards Misaki, crouched down slowly, and turned his back on Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Come on. I'll carry you on my back until I go somewhere with lots of people. When the car can go, let your parents pick you up."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, this is not good..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you get injured walking barefoot, it will be more difficult."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki brushed off Misaki's worries with a sincere argument.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps she really felt that Mizuki was right this time, and Misaki hesitantly climbed onto Mizuki's back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After confirming that Misaki was gripped firmly, Mizuki stood up "okay".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, even though Misaki was indeed slender, it was still heavy. Mizuki couldn't contain his surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you okay?&#8230; By the way, if you dare to say that I am heavy, I will be angry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I will do the best."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki replied with a wry smile to Misaki, who expressed concern and restraint at the same time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He walked with Misaki behind his back. Mizuki couldn't help but think.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This year's summer vacation is like a white horse. Such a satisfying summer vacation was the first time in my life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Summer vacation, it's almost over."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. This year's summer vacation was so much fun that it felt short. It's a shame if it ends."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then I don't have to worry anymore."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki smiled calmly while chatting with Misaki on his back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Happy days will continue. Mizuki hoped from the bottom of his heart that things would really turn out like this, and left.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After school one day shortly after the start of the second semester.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay, done."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After entering the last article, Mizuki leaned back on the chair and stretched.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Today's work is not the usual behind-the-scenes work, but rather writing a library report issued by the committee. The library committee writes a book recommendation report for the library once a year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This year it was Mizuki's turn.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Working behind the scenes and writing weekday reports are completely different. Because I was facing the computer in the same position all the time, there was a stiff sound in my joints. However, with just a slight stretch, the excess strength is lost, and the whole body is filled with comfortable fatigue.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was exactly five in the afternoon. It's just about to end. Come here first today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san&#8230; It's almost time to go back."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki stared at the empty seat across from him. Misaki, who had just been sitting there, sent the book with the barcode and back label to the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Turning off the computer, Mizuki waited anxiously for Misaki to return.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Actually, he had something to report to Misaki today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a while, Misaki poked her head out from between the bookshelves.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The books have all been shipped. Did you get them there?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thanks, I just finished it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see. Let's come here first today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Now is probably the best opportunity to raise the topic. Thinking so, just as Mizuki was about to speak.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, Mizuki-san, have you figured out what you want to do yet?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki suddenly raised her head and asked Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other hand, Mizuki who was asked was surprised. Because he was planning to report this to Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, this is the right time to say it. I just wanted to tell you that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so? Then..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well. I was looking for something interesting on the Internet, and I finally found it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki watched with shining eyes, Mizuki nodded confidently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So Misaki cheered, "Oh! Good!" She was so happy as if it was her own business.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Misaki's reaction like this, Mizuki himself was a little embarrassed. As if covering his own thoughts, Mizuki opened the student handbook and continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I checked and found that you can go the day after Sunday. Are you free that day?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, yes. I didn't have to go to the hospital then, and there was nothing I did."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then I'll call. I've made reservations for two."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After receiving Misaki's answer, Mizuki drew a circle in the manual memo and wrote "Reservation by phone".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Reservation? Mizuki-san, do you need to make an appointment for what you want to do?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, yes. Because I want to attend the workshop of the handicraft department."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Workshops? What are you doing?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"A secret. Please look forward to that day."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki was probably just worried about what Mizuki found. In the face of her constant questioning, Mizuki was only vague. Since it was a "what I want to do" that I discovered the hard way, I wanted to hide it until that day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Mizuki's unintentional childish attitude, Misaki's eyes looked like they were looking at her little brother, and she gave up after saying "Then I'll look forward to it".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, this workshop needs to bring books and cloth. Misaki-san, can you prepare it in no time?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then it's the same with me. Let's go shopping together before the workshop starts. It's in the event area of &#8203;&#8203;the station building, and you can buy cloth downstairs."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay. What books are there? Books okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Anything is okay. However, please bring a copy that you can make yourself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You can make it yourself&#8230; Well, I thought about it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki shrugged, as if to say, "What are you going to do? Wool cloth". Of course, deep in her eyes there is hope that is not hidden. However, if Misaki's expectations are too high, it will be a pressure for....</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, but Misaki-san, you might not be interested in that, so if you look forward to it too much, I'll be a little embarrassed..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You don't have to hold me back this early. Mizuki-san, when you went to the cat cafe earlier. Didn't you say 'Even though it's my first time here, it was really fun.' I'm sure I'm the same as you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that so&#8230; Well, then&#8230;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Stop. Come on! I'm looking forward to Mizuki-san's arrival!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki completely crushed Mizuki who lacked confidence with a full smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">One day after an appointment at the library, it was Sunday. In the corner of the event venue that was directly connected from the station to the top floor of the commercial building&#8212;&#8212;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mizuki-san..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's wrong, Misaki-san"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It turns out that cutting cardboard is a difficult task. ...A great invention..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you use a utility knife while saying weird things, you'll cut your finger. Now is the key time, let's focus on that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki accompanied Misaki's bullshit, the blade of the utility knife hanging about two centimeters thick on the cardboard.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Once it was two centimeters thick, the utility knife couldn't cut it all the way through. The two of them repeatedly cut the same spot with utility knives, and a thin layer of sweat trickled down their foreheads.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The crafts workshop the two of them participated in was called "Turn a book into a hardcover". Also known as "handmade book". What they both do now is cut the cardboard as a hard cover material.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This handcrafted book is the "what I want to do" that Mizuki invented.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I came across this workshop when I was looking for an online activity where I could have fun with Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Create a book that is unique in the world and only yours. The sentence written on this promotion page caught the interest of Mizuki who had been repairing books for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After the actual experience, I found that learning to make covers by hand was also quite exciting. All of this was knowledge that Mizuki had never tried, and the act of making something yourself was also exciting. Mizuki felt in his heart that it would be fun to come and challenge.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But&#8212;&#8212;in the end, it was only Mizuki's own thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8230;Misaki-san, that's not very interesting, is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki who had finished cutting the cardboard asked carefully while peeking at Misaki who was still struggling with the utility knife.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From now on, Misaki's face became embarrassed, and she kept saying "woo".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing her like this, Mizuki started to worry whether he was being too paranoid about his own interests.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other hand, Misaki, who was asked about it, stopped her hand operating the utility knife and raised her head blankly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh? Why do you ask?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry if this is my imagination. But Misaki-san, you've been talking about something from the start... So I'm just guessing, do you think this is boring or what? That..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, sorry! I was so concentrated that I didn't even notice. But, I'm very serious about this! This workshop was so much fun!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you talking about. &#8230;Is it because you're concentrating? Does it seem like I'm thinking too much? That's great..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki heaved a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing this, Misaki smiled helplessly at Mizuki who felt relieved.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mizuki-san, you're too much trouble for me. Since you have time to care whether I enjoy it, you should enjoy it yourself. Otherwise, I won't be able to enjoy it in peace."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Is that so?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's right!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki seemed to have finished what she wanted to say, and started cutting the cardboard again with a serious expression on her face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Mizuki himself didn't enjoy it, Misaki wouldn't be able to enjoy it either. It did make sense. It was great to go out with Misaki because it was the first time I had such an experience, but most importantly I was attracted to Misaki. Mizuki was able to have fun with her only because she was by his side, enjoying himself to the fullest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki felt like he had switched roles.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But now that you know this, you can focus on the work in front of you. The reason for this was that in order for Mizuki to enjoy the highest level of enjoyment, it was necessary to devote all his strength to finishing this book.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While listening to the lecturer's explanation, Mizuki continued his&nbsp;manual work.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki, who was focused on his carton, didn't notice, and Misaki, who was watching him beside him, gave a small smile. She looked at Mizuki with gentle eyes, as if to say, "Mmmm, it's fine.".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Cardboard strips are affixed to washi and wrapped in reinforced fabric to create the hard, thick cover typical of a hardcover book. (note: washi or wagami are paper made by traditional Japanese methods.)</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The original cover and the cover of the Bunko Book have been removed and the parts needed to convert it into a hard cover have been installed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After the hard cover is finished, it is finally finished by combining it with the library book with various parts attached.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The crafting workshop that continued to advance without a break, finally completed the last step within the allotted time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After the modifications were complete, on the table in front of him was the book he had turned into himself. Mizuki couldn't help but laugh while stroking the cardboard cover covered with rocket and star patterned cloth with his&nbsp;hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Damn! This is good too! Let's take a picture!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Apart from Misaki, who had also finished retouching her own book, the camera on her cell phone was shooting the book. Judging by the way she happily pressed the shutter, she also really enjoyed the workshop.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">By the way, the fabric used by Misaki is a sunflower pattern, and the flowers on the cover are stunning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Listen, Mizuki-san. The dimensions of the cover and back are exactly the same. I have great wisdom, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't worry, Misaki-san. Anyone can do well as long as they listen to the lecturer and use the tools properly."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You should praise me well. Mizuki-san, that's why you can't get a girlfriend."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So Misaki held the book to her chest, her expression changed, and she happily put her hand on Mizuki's shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. Sure enough, Mizuki-san, you have an inconsiderate character. I felt a little disgusted one day when you were enlightened. I feel better now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You pretended to be praising me, but actually you insulted me, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There's no such thing. I mean Mizuki-san, you're the best. 'How can I be so gentle with you?' You say so."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki started arguing, blinking. She dodged Mizuki's question without a word. No sign of reflection at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As for such Misaki, Mizuki shook his&nbsp;head helplessly with a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, that's exactly what you said. Misaki-san, you are really gentle, I know this very well. And you are also very good at enlightening others, including you who have helped me now. I am very grateful to you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Uh huh? Is that&#8230;is that so?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki was probably praised from the front and couldn't be more sincere, and by the way, she was both grateful and embarrassed. Misaki blushed, and her tone became a little unclear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I didn't expect something like that to come out of Mizuki-san. Could it be raining tomorrow?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I won't be leaving anything behind tomorrow. I can only say these things today. ...Because of you, Misaki-san, I'm also enjoying this activity well. What I just said is about this matter. Thank you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki's expression was slightly awkward, he looked away from Misaki and turned his head. His face was even redder than Misaki's. Admitting what you really think is more embarrassing than you think.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki turned his back on Misaki who was still smiling broadly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though it was a bit embarrassing, Mizuki had no regrets in his&nbsp;heart, but felt very good to be able to tell it. That's what was written on his face. On the other hand, because of this, he couldn't let Misaki see his expression like that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, I modified this book, can you accept it if you don't mind? This book is also mentioned in the recommended books in the library, and it is a novel continuation of the film we will be watching together during summer vacation. So, I also want Misaki-san to read it..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm happy to have it... But is it really that good? You've worked so hard"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, that's fine. That's what I planned."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see.&#8212;Thank you!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki smiled and took the book that was turned over and handed over to Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, at the same time, she also placed her modified book into Mizuki's hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"In that case, I will also give the book I modified to Mizuki-san. As a thank you gift for making me so happy all day today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, this is not good! It's fine without returning the gift, Misaki-san, you really liked this book, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm going to die soon, and it's because I liked this book so much that I wanted to give this book, which I put all my energy into, to Mizuki-san."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki's words made Mizuki's heart clench into a ball, and the pain was endless.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just as Misaki said, she who was smiling in front of him right now would die in the not too distant future.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, as proof that Misaki is here today, next to Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki picked up the weight of Misaki's modified library book.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I will appreciate this book."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki nodded in satisfaction when she saw Mizuki holding the book to his&nbsp;chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki looked at her like this and thought to himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It would be nice if the warm and safe days could last forever.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To Mizuki, the time he spent with Misaki had become something he didn't want to lose. Although I don't know what it will be like, Mizuki wants to continue the current relationship until it will end someday. He prayed from the bottom of his heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, in this world there is no permanent relationship. Mizuki's prayers, good or bad, were easily crushed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The second semester has entered the month of November, and school is full of energy and busyness. After all, the cultural festival is coming soon. This afternoon class is also filled with cultural festival preparations.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki's class is also busy preparing for the show - Haunted House.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Can you bring the plywood used as the tombstone?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay! Wait a moment."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki, the person in charge of the large props, was also quite busy. However, when everyone did something together, he himself felt very happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Picking up the plywood on which the materials were stacked, rushed back to his post.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this moment, Mizuki saw Misaki talking to her classmates.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki had really been the central figure in the class over the past few months.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her approachable, bright and cheerful personality makes her very popular with both men and women. There were also many people taking turns looking for her to discuss various things.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">By the way, it seems that in order to avoid the drastic change in Mizuki's environment in class, Misaki still basically doesn't come to talk to Mizuki in class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I hope Mizuki-san can adapt to class life at her own pace."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Putting this aside, Mizuki was actually a little worried that Misaki might be too reluctant to prepare for this cultural festival, which would cause her body to crumble. Even when she was just entering her second semester, Misaki's condition only got to the point where she occasionally went to the hospital.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But since early October, the dosage of Misaki's medication has also increased. Her body was being eroded by the disease. Mizuki hoped that she would put her physical condition first.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even so, but if he worried too much, it would only make Misaki feel bad. Now, to concentrate on his work, Mizuki picked up the plywood and left.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I brought plywood!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why, thank you! Then paint in one breath."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki and the boys in the class painted the plywood with gray paint. For some reason, Mizuki remembered the handmade book workshop he attended in September, and was somehow happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, Akiyama, you started this semester a little differently."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Uh, is that so?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, I find it easy to get along."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">During the painting process, the boy Mizuki was working with suddenly said this to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The change seems bigger than I imagined. Perhaps because of his alliance activities with Misaki, he began to adjust to class life. I can't thank Misaki enough. While thinking about this, the bell rang to announce that the preparations for today's cultural festival had been completed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The cleaning duties after the class meeting were over, and Mizuki walked along the corridor towards the library as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking out the window accidentally, the trees on school are colorful with red leaves, scattered yellow leaves, and autumn is full of beauty.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is a rare opportunity. It might be worth asking Misaki-san to appreciate the autumn leaves."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A thought suddenly appeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And as soon as he said that, Mizuki felt even more that it was a good idea. Maybe it could be an option to suggest to Misaki later. Take the tram for a short distance, and there are several spots in the area that are arguably good places to see red leaves, so you don't have to worry about going anywhere.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki doesn't need to be on duty to clean up, she's probably already in the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">How will Misaki react to his proposal? Mizuki thought expectantly, and quickened his pace towards the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, in front of the library, he saw a figure he was used to seeing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki--"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki wanted to say hello as usual, but he stopped midway shouting, and hastily retreated to the corner he just passed. The reason was because Misaki was talking to someone else.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki poked his head out from the corner of the corridor and peeked at Misaki. It was the boy in the same class who was talking to her. The name seems... Hirose. Like Misaki, he was also a member of the central figure in the class, and Mizuki had also heard that he was the champ of a certain sports club. In short, he is completely different from Mizuki, a big celebrity with a cheerful personality and a practical way of dealing with people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing the two of them talking intimately, Mizuki felt numb in his&nbsp;heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is the first time I know there is a library in a place like this. Fujieda-san, are you here to borrow a book?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh, is that so? It's amazing that Fujieda-san still does this kind of thing even though she's not a member of the library committee."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This, this is not something worth mentioning! Nothing special."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki listened intently to the conversation between the two.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This behavior is eavesdropping. Definitely not something to behold. Even though he thought so in his mind, he still couldn't stop the tapping.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki immediately regretted his&nbsp;judgment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Although it's a bit sudden, Fujieda-san, you don't have a boyfriend yet. Well, if you could&#8230; could you go out with me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki, who was straining his&nbsp;ears to eavesdrop in anxiety, heard enough to make him fall into despair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tha..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But I saw Fujieda-san recently, and I always thought you were great."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Misaki, who was taken aback by the sudden confession, Hirose opened his mouth even more recklessly. His voice was too serious to be taken seriously. It was a serious confession for Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And Misaki seemed quite happy, blushing and smiling shyly, listening to Hirose's words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, Mizuki who witnessed all this suddenly felt dizzy and nauseous. The pain in the inside of the head and stomach was unbearable, like a tangled brain and internal organs. I don't know if the semicircular channel is paralyzed, Mizuki felt the ground seem to be surging back and forth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Uuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuugh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A gush of nausea flowed from his throat, Mizuki covered his mouth and fled from the place.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki entered the toilet as if running away. However, since it had been quite a while since lunch, no matter how much Mizuki vomited, only gastric juices came out of her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a while, his&nbsp;nausea subsided slightly, Mizuki leaned against the wall weakly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">How will Misaki react to Hirose's confession? Could it be that she accepted Hirose's confession when he squatted in the toilet so embarrassingly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Only this incident made Mizuki unable to let go for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Compared to Mizuki, Hirose had no idea how cool he was. This too of course. After all, they are big celebrities at the top of the class pyramid. Appearance and behavior are quite uncontrollable, and the attitude of dealing with people is also calm. He has everything that Mizuki doesn't have.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thinking about it normally, Misaki probably had no reason to reject Hirose's confession. Compared to continuing to play ally games with Mizuki, she would definitely be able to spend a happier time with Hirose. After all, it's strange that Misaki still doesn't have a boyfriend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki was well aware of this kind of thing. But...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki crouched down and spat out words of resistance. Tears that were different from the physiological phenomenon of choking flowed down his cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki accidentally witnessed the moment when Misaki was confessed by someone else. The feelings in his heart were anxiety and fear of losing Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki knew in his&nbsp;heart that this was just his&nbsp;own wishful thinking, and at the same time he also knew that he was ugly when he developed these feelings. Misaki doesn't belong to Mizuki. She has her own life, and her life is her own.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even so... still very resistant. Misaki might just disappear from his side. Thinking of this, Mizuki's chest hurt so much that he wanted to tear his&nbsp;body to pieces.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Ah, so I see..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki finally realized his&nbsp;feelings and lowered his&nbsp;head helplessly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">His feelings towards Misaki had changed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At first I just thought it was a great friend. And after listening to Misaki talk about the past, her figure overlaps with his&nbsp;mother, and he becomes someone who wants to happily accompany her until the very last moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you just stop there, there won't be any problems. But his heart sank deeper and deeper into his&nbsp;subconsciously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What should I do in the future..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the worst situation, he clarified his feelings. And at such a time what to do was the best, Mizuki didn't know.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The restlessness that springs from anxiety makes Mizuki scratch his head, and he gets lost in a maze of unanswered questions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki, who returned to class, sat in his&nbsp;chair against the wall and was alone in a daze.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't know how much time has passed. By the time he regained consciousness, school time had passed. The sun had set in the west. The classmates who were staying in the class had inadvertently dispersed, leaving Mizuki alone in the dimly lit classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So you're here!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki's body shook at the sudden sound and the flashing lights.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki turned stiffly, and Misaki stood at the door of the classroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, why are you here?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki asked, careful not to see Misaki panicking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Mizuki opened his&nbsp;mouth, he kept thinking about the status quo in his&nbsp;mind.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">There wasn't much reason why Misaki would appear at such a time. And the most probable possibility was that she was here to inform the Alliance would be disbanded, "Because I'm with Hirose, the alliance ends here.". The chances of her making such an announcement were very high.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki's mind fell into a swamp in seconds.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As for Mizuki, who was full of this worst development, Misaki's tone was extremely helpless.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No matter how I waited, I didn't see Mizuki-san coming to the library, so I came to see you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">said Misaki, walking to Mizuki's seat and smiling at him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other hand, Mizuki was feeling anxious about Misaki smiling cheerfully.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The calm part of the brain understands that it is a puff. However, his mind was already in a mess, and he didn't know what to do at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Enough is enough. Can't survive. Instead of being tormented by such painful thoughts all the time, it's better to reset everything and have fun.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The desire to escape from his closed world dominates the body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, Mizuki who finally couldn't hold on, showed a crooked smile and looked into Misaki's eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You ask me why I didn't go to the library? I did. But... let me see, what else can I do but run."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Eh?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even though I turned and ran straight away, but now don't talk about friends, you even have a boyfriend."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mizuki-san, wait a minute! Calm down. By the way, have you seen it? Someone else. I confess, but&#8212;&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You don't need to explain. Isn't Hirose-san very handsome. You want to end your wish before leaving. Wouldn't it be better to let him do it compared to me, I'm sure you will be happier with him."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki interrupted Misaki, who was about to say something, and continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Every time he uttered a syllable, Mizuki felt his&nbsp;heart slowly break.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even so, Mizuki said something that went against his&nbsp;heart - something that made the innocent Misaki very confused and unforgettable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"To Misaki-san, such an alliance is just a hindrance."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Who knows? I&#8230; don't understand anymore."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki's questioning voice was already tinged with despair. Mizuki's answer had also given up on himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At the same time, Mizuki felt intense nausea again due to the guilt he felt for hurting Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki glanced at Misaki with a pale face, and his&nbsp;expression changed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps his patience, with Mizuki's mouth open had reached its limit. When their eyes met, Misaki looked at Mizuki with angry eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm angry. You're almost there. Mizuki-san, don't smile when you see me confess!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know everything, including what you did was just toy with my emotions..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki answered weakly in response to Misaki's somewhat angry voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Having angered someone important, the desire to run away that had been raging in Mizuki's heart suddenly disappeared without a trace. The rest, only regret and nihilism for their actions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, for Mizuki-san, is an alliance with me a barrier? Do you really want to disband immediately?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki's gaze contained, "If that's really getting in your way, then help now. You are free" means.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing this, Mizuki grimaced like a lost child.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How did this happen! I want to be with you, Misaki-san, forever. I want to be by your side from now on. But..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why add 'but'? It's fine if you say it honestly!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can't say it! Since Hirose-san suits you better than me&#8230; I couldn't take your happiness away from Misaki-san on purpose."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't decide my own happiness. It's me, not you, who can decide if I'm happy or not! Please don't say such cool words!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Misaki's roar, Mizuki was dumbfounded and took a deep breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki's life is her own, Mizuki knows that very well. However, he subconsciously forced his own thoughts on her. Ignoring everything around me, I acted self-righteously towards someone important.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki finally realized what a stupid thing he had done, and was disappointed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...I think Hirose-san is really a nice person. He's more handsome than you, smarter than you, and talks more than you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ugh&#8230;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Sure enough, no one could compare to Hirose. I don't deserve to be standing next to Misaki. Mizuki was disheartened, and her face became even lower.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"However, I refused. I said 'sorry' and immediately refused."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Misaki's words made Mizuki lift his&nbsp;head without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you refusing, why..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, why not! Could it be that you really don't understand?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Understood, what I understand..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No, Mizuki really felt something. It was just that he wasn't sure of the answer, so he couldn't say it. So Misaki, who was angry and impatient, looked at Mizuki with tears in her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why are you so slow! The person I like is Mizuki! Compared to Hirose-san, I like Mizuki more! Don't let me clarify things so obvious!!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh... ...Ah, that..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The confession mixed with anger and tears made Mizuki stand on the spot and was stunned.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Originally, what he heard were words of joy that would make Mizuki cry, but right now he didn't have the leisure to be happy. Instead, he felt helpless with the current situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other hand, Misaki couldn't seem to hold herself back, and she continued to speak more and more excitedly as she burst into tears.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"After all, Mizuki-san, you've forgotten everything about being in the hospital two years ago. I was really shocked! Really, no matter how disinterested you are in strangers, you should be there. You haven't fallen in love until second year of high school!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even though you're right, but you haven't fallen in love yet, have you. Misaki-san..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't get off topic!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Forgive me..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though Mizuki tried to refute, he was still no match for the threatening Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, the situation is still not very good. Misaki was crying in anger, and if it continued like this, it might lead to some kind of riot.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: large;">No, what was more important than this was that Misaki said something that made her care a lot, and above all&#8230; Mizuki also wanted to apologize to Misaki for losing her temper.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To do this, first of all, Misaki had to calm down and then listen to her explanation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So Mizuki said "Sorry" in his&nbsp;heart, and squeezed Misaki's hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Facing Mizuki's sudden action, Misaki's crying eyes widened and she held her breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh... why? Are you going to give up now? I haven't complained enough."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, giving up is really giving up&#8230; Just&#8230; can we switch places first? If we were here, who would see it. It would be troublesome everywhere."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki looked at Mizuki in dissatisfaction with a flushed face, and Mizuki's face was redder than a tomato, she answered with an uncertain look.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indeed, now is the stage of preparation for the cultural festival. Even though the school day had passed completely, there were still classes left to prepare for the program. I don't know if anyone will skip this class any time. No, if one heard the commotion just now, it wouldn't be surprising to be run over.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"....okay."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing Mizuki point out, Misaki seems to be aware of this, she frowned sadly and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">*</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is impossible to have a quiet conversation in class. So Mizuki and Misaki temporarily moved to a room where no one would go - the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Anyway, it's nice that no one sees us like that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8230;Hmm."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki showed a pleasant smile and looked to the other side of the table. On the other hand, Misaki sat on the chair with a displeased face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She might still be in a bad mood, but I need to calm down for now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course, so did Mizuki. He no longer intends to be closed in his own world.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki circled the table and bowed his&nbsp;head deeply at Misaki pre-emptively.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, I'm really sorry just now. I didn't listen to your explanation, so I lost my temper and said something I shouldn't have said... It's natural for you to be angry. I'm really sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eh... well, I was also a little angry, so I said too much. Sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Accepting Mizuki's apology, Misaki also apologized with a sullen face. After apologizing to each other, Mizuki who was urged by Misaki to "sit down," returned to the other side of the table and sat down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After sitting opposite each other, a subtle silence descended between the two of them. Misaki was in a bad mood, and Mizuki didn't know what to say.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This subtle atmosphere lasted quite a while. Mizuki who was determined to "act as a boy now," gave a stiff smile and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Didn't you just say that, what happened at the hospital, what was that... what did it mean...?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki asked Misaki this question.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, his voice was anticlimactic. Every time Mizuki said a word, Misaki's mood got worse and worse.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, did I say something that upset you&#8230;?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8230;You still don't remember it. Our first meeting."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Mizuki's head lowered, Misaki sighed in exaggeration.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I also thought that you were very handsome at that time..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Um... if that doesn't disturb your peace, could you give me some hint?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki said to Misaki in a tone that could no longer be respected. request.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Okay. Then I'll give you a hint, think about it. That was about two years ago. The place we met was in the hospital atrium. Let me say it first, this meeting isn't the passing type."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seemed like she wanted to remind Mizuki, Misaki didn't answer the question directly, but gave some hints.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">About two years ago, it should have been just moments before my mother died. That time in the hospital, his memories relate to a girl his age. And it doesn't just go away...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After adding the search criteria, Mizuki, who searched his memories, finally found a match.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That, Misaki-san. I dare ask, did you faint in the hospital atrium two years ago... ?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8230;You finally remember? Yes, that's me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki asked timidly, while Misaki pointed at herself sadly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At the same time, the memory of that time clearly appeared in Mizuki's mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was early winter two years ago. When Mizuki was about to take a shortcut through the hospital atrium, he found a girl falling, clutching her chest in the shade of a tree.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki immediately judged that this was no small matter, he took the girl and asked the nearest nurse for help. The person who came to help was a nurse who Mizuki also knew. The person immediately called someone else to help and picked up the girl on a stretcher and carried her away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The day after tomorrow, the nurse came to thank Mizuki by saying "She's safe and healthy"... But that girl was actually Misaki or something, it was really unthinkable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry. I really didn't have time to remember your face back then... Besides, I'm usually not very good at remembering other people's faces..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmph..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki was still silent making excuses while apologizing, Misaki looked at him sadly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Once you realize your heart, the relationship will end. "Now is not the time for stupid excuses like that," Mizuki immediately regretted.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, I was helped by you too. As for the fact that you don't remember my face, I don't plan on making any irresponsible remarks. Mizuki-san, there is nothing wrong with you, it was indeed an emergency at that time. &#8212;&#8212;However, let me say this last sentence."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki looked at Mizuki with meaningful eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki was afraid of what she was going to say, and Misaki looked at him with a relaxed expression on her face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you so much for saving me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After saying that, she lowered her head deeply.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Eh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can't say this yet.... --- Instead, I chose to enter this school just to thank you. That's also a wish I wanted to end before I left."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki said shyly towards Mizuki who tilted his&nbsp;head blankly in disbelief. The "reason for choosing Mizuki-san High School" that I mentioned in the past seems to be this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If it wasn't for Mizuki-san, my life might have ended then. So, thank you very much."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's all... If you want to thank me, please tell the nurses and doctors who saved you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki shook his&nbsp;head in embarrassment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Misaki replied softly, "There's nothing like that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Actually that day, I found out that my test results were not optimistic, so I was a little disappointed. Then I ran to the corner of the atrium alone&#8230; I didn't expect to suddenly get sick, and I couldn't do anything about it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki said while looking into the distance, as if remembering what happened back then.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It hurts, it's uncomfortable. But no one can find me like this... At that time. I really thought, 'Ah, am I going to die here?'."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But Mizuki-san is the only one. You, even by chance, found me like that. And you held my hand tightly and said, "It's okay!" At that time, Mizuki-san, your voice probably kept me here. In the world. So&#8212;thank you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">said Misaki, smiling at Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just then, Mizuki was really trying to cheer the girl up a bit, calling out to her desperately. Maybe it didn't bring her much comfort, even so, Mizuki wanted to do something for her and held her hand tightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, Mizuki's actions were not in vain. The girl he saved&#8212;&#8212;Misaki. So cue her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I heard from the nurse that it was you who saved me, so I actually wanted to come quickly and thank you. As I said earlier, I know Mizuki-san. However, because I was just attacked, so I couldn't do it. Then, when I was finally able to leave the ward, I thought, "I can thank you this time!", but at that moment&#8212;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...My mother died, so I'm not going to the hospital anymore, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki continued her words, and Misaki nodded silently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"And then, I changed schools, and now I'm finally in the same class at the same school as you, and I'm still thinking, 'I can do it this time!' ...The first day of my transfer, after school I followed you, Mizuki- san, and greeted you at the library, but I didn't expect you to remember me at all... Thanks to you, I can finally talk about it now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, so, I'm really sorry about this&#8230; No, you're not saying it now, since I'm innocent, so you're not going to make any irresponsible comments about this matter?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Saying that, but I'm still a little uncomfortable&#8230;Yeah! It's Mizuki-san, you're no good!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's this..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing Misaki's arrogant conclusion, Mizuki looked up at the sky and sighed in confusion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Right... Also, um, looks like I just confessed, right..., could it be that you have good intentions for me... since then?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki with a bit of courage remaining, he asked the most important question.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though Mizuki himself wanted to pretend that nothing happened, he blushed greatly, and his&nbsp;voice was full of nervousness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Not. Back then, I only thought of you as a savior."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Misaki shook her head and denied it easily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki was very sad, and his&nbsp;heart was depressed. "It would be better if I didn't ask.".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But, come to think of it, I've been in love with Mizuki-san since then. It's just that I'm afraid to admit it myself&#8230; That's why I said those words to Yoko-san back then."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Those words? What happened between you and my mother?&#8221;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki was a little confused by the new words that suddenly appeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Misaki shook her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I won't tell Mizuki-san, who forgot me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You are here again. I think you should tell me about everything."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This time, Mizuki turned to look at Misaki with dissatisfied eyes. She still insisted on saying "no".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki also has indigestion. I was literally toyed with by Misaki in the palm of my hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But--</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But now, I'm very grateful for that promise. It was because of that promise that I was able to see Mizuki-san again&#8212;&#8212;I personally said that I like you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki's cheeks were dyed red, and she said this nervously, her every move and every move was too cute&#8230; Mizuki already felt that it was fine if there were still some unsolved mysteries.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And... there are more important things to do now than this trivial mystery!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, there's something I want to tell you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8230;Um"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since the person he likes has already shown her love for him, if he can't do anything about it, he's no longer worthy to be called a man.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki closed his eyes and took a deep breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then he slowly opened his eyes, straightened his posture, and faced Misaki who was sitting across from him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No matter what I say later, please don't be surprised."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Your own opening statement is so unlucky&#8230; Wait a minute? Could it be that I will soon be dumped?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki, who left the small theater, started to panic.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki looked at her with a smile, and called out "Misaki-san" gently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki immediately sat up straight and replied "Hai!". She seemed to have all kinds of imaginations running through her mind, but for now, she returned her consciousness to Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, please prepare yourself mentally."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay, okay. Then, you can come here!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki took a deep breath and stuffed all his&nbsp;emotions into his&nbsp;mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Misaki-san, marry me..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"--Eh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki's words melted into the air, replaced by Misaki's trembling voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, Mizuki-san, I probably heard wrong. - What did you just say?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I said 'marry me'. That's what we call a marriage proposal."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you serious."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can't take it seriously anymore."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki affirmed repeatedly, while Mizuki covered his&nbsp;embarrassment with full aura, nodding his&nbsp;head without changing his&nbsp;face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki probably didn't think, let alone in response to his&nbsp;confession, Mizuki actually proposed? Misaki "Ah, um, calm down..." While rubbing her temples, she looked at Mizuki again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then what, Mizuki-san, generally speaking, shouldn't you say 'with me' at times like this?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I like Misaki-san so much that I could suddenly propose to you. I just want to be with you, is there a problem?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think this is all a problem. No matter how I put it, I think it's a bit too much. ......But I'm happy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you feel happy, then I have no more problems. - Well, from a practical point of view, I still know very well that we can't legally marry, but you can rest assured about this, after all, this is just my passion."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I actually don't really understand this theory, and every time I say a word, my face burns with embarrassment. But even so, with unwavering sincerity, Mizuki confidently affirmed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So Misaki laughed happily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see. You like me to the point that you can suddenly propose... Hmm, come to think of it, it seems pretty good. I can fully sense Mizuki-san's seriousness."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I would be so embarrassed if you whipped the corpse over and over like this&#8230;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This time it was Mizuki's turn, his&nbsp;face turning red.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki's expression softened naturally because he saw Misaki's natural smile for the first time today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...Ah, but, is that okay? You really won't regret it? I'll definitely do a lot of things that don't look at the atmosphere subconsciously. Besides, if something goes wrong, I'll get angry right away. That... may not have any fun with me..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Misaki's smile immediately turned cloudy, and she looked at Mizuki with great uneasiness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki is usually a person who does whatever she wants, but when it comes to a critical moment, she starts to worry about it. Mizuki felt in his&nbsp;heart that she was very cute. Even though his emotions were a little impatient, he would soon show his full weakness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Putting those things aside, Mizuki slowly shook his head towards Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I wouldn't be happy with anything other than Misaki-san. In terms of your skill with people, I don't know how much better you are than me. And regardless of the atmosphere, we belong to each other. I guess I'll give Misaki-san too many problems."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...That's how it is. That means, we're actually very similar."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With just one word, it was impossible to erase all of Misaki's anxiety.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki wasn't confident enough that he could do this yet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki wanted to be arrogant that he could indeed touch Misaki's heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Misaki's expression soften again, Mizuki thought so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this moment, Misaki pointed at him with her index finger.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then, there's one more thing. - It won't be long before I disappear from your eyes, Mizuki-san. I'll leave you alone and take the first step. Is it alright?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki said earnestly. No, it had to be said putting reality in front of Mizuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It will be gone in no time. One step ahead. Just imagining it was scary.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki couldn't imagine what it would be like to see Misaki disappear from his side.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, this is the reality. There is no doubt that it will come, the future is a foregone conclusion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And, that's when the time came. I might not survive. Maybe it will be defeated by the fact of losing Misaki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, even so, Mizuki didn't change his&nbsp;answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki wrapped his arms around Misaki's outstretched hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you really disappear, I want to be with you even more. If possible, I want to spend a few days with you. I want to be with you until the very last moment."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The voice slowly disappeared in the library.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as I remember what happened after Misaki left, maybe it would be the right answer to start keeping my distance from her now. In this way, the trauma to yourself will not be so great. You could say a wise choice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Mizuki couldn't make that choice right now. Even if he knew that he would be bruised everywhere, he wanted to spend it with Misaki. Only this thought can be learned from heaven and earth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki conveyed his intentions, waiting for Misaki's answer like when he proposed to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Misaki's next reaction was different from before. Water, Big tears started to flow from her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki didn't expect that he would make her cry by this scene, and his face suddenly turned blue.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Did I say something that made you unhappy anymore?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no. I'm not crying because I'm sad, I'm so happy that I can't hold back the tears."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chaotic situation, Misaki explained why she was crying while crying.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, really&#8230;. Looks like I have one more request before I go."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Misaki said with a sigh, and looked into Mizuki's eyes with a calm face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you, Mizuki-san. I am very happy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, no, no&#8230; That, that means we&#8230;"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki asked vaguely to confirm something.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So Misaki showed an undisguised smile and nodded clearly and firmly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then please take care of me. Even though I will definitely leave you one step ahead of you, my useless boyfriend, please let me snuggle by your side until the last moment."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#8212;Well, I am very happy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Mizuki looked at Misaki with a smile, leaned over the table and wiped the tears from his face.</span></p>
