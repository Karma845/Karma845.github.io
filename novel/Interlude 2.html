<h3>Interlude &#8211; Siblings Got Lock in The Same Room, But Nothing Happen</h3>

<p class="calibre4">It seems I’m more of a troublesome person I believe.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Onii-chan loves me. I thought it was impossible.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I want to get along with… *sigh*”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was shocked to find out the reason for his change of heart.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe I was overwhelmed… but in an instant it made me feel stupid.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And so I reflected on what I had done until today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I was so happy knowing Onii-chan was making a move on me. I thought that I should reconsider my plan that I had prepared so carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yes, I was supposed to… reflect and try again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I think that’s… foul play.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">However, I was shaken again thirty minutes after I left the coffee shop.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“What are you doing with my sister, Senpai?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I can’t just sit tight and let my sister get involved with a jerk like you, you know.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t you dare utter a single word to my sister.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yes, I’m a Siscon, so what? I can’t overlook that shitty attitude of yours.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I remember each word of my Onii-chan that helped me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">He helped me again without caring for himself…</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yeah, it can’t…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It can’t be… impossible…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">At that moment, I felt as if something had shattered.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I could feel the swirling of emotions within my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It hurts… I don’t think I can take it any longer.</p>
<p class="calibre4">So I went inside…</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Excuse me.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I quietly turned the doorknob and slowly stepped into the room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Su~”</p>

<p class="calibre4">As I entered the room, I heard a small voice.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I slowly walked towards the bed where he was sleeping and approached him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Onii~chan…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">This is my brother’s room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m standing right next to him adoring his sleeping face.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course… this action was dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre4">If he woke up, my efforts thus far would blow up in an instant. There was no excuse for sneaking into his room at this dark hour.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though I knew all this, I couldn’t suppress my emotions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s all your fault. You showed me how cool you are…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I gently touched his soft cheek. I felt his body warmth flowing into my body, and it was getting hotter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I want to touch more. I want to get closer. I want to feel him even more.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before I knew it, I had snuck into his bed, lying right next to him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s so warm…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">The warmth I felt earlier was incomparable. As if I’m being hugged by Onii-chan. I’m starting to lose my consciousness.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Was he always this big? No, I think I’m small.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Still, I think it’s better this way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When was the last time I slept with him like this? When we were little, we used to sleep in the same futon. I used to believe that we’d always be together.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But now I understand.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I realize how precious the time I spent with him was.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s why I’m so blessed at this moment. I have no regrets. This place is so warm that I don’t wanna leave.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Aah…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">*Sniff*</p>
<p class="calibre4">He smells so good.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s strange. My thoughts are getting blurry and unable to control myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I noticed that I’m getting wet. Certainly my body is burning, but I’m not sweating because of the heat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I felt hesitant for a moment, wondering… What am I doing right next to him? But I can’t resist the temptation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Nh~ Uu~ Ahn~”</p>
<p class="calibre4">While gently moving my finger, I try to suppress my leaking voice… So that I wouldn’t disturb his peaceful sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Slowly… silently… so that he won’t wake up. *Aah~* Such wickedness made me feel even hornier.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But it wasn’t enough&mdash;❤️</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m not sure why I’m craving more, even though this is a perfect situation for me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah! Fingers…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was something I had never done before.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Normally, I could only imagine his touch through the laptop screen.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But now, Onii-chan is right beside me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But this is way more dangerous than ever before. I’m about to climax, I know it’s pretty close… but after that I don’t know if I’ll be able to stand up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yes, I know. I know… but,</p>
<p class="calibre4">I want it.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I slowly grabbed his left hand with my right hand which was sticky wet. I noticed. The size of his palm and the length of the fingers are completely different from mine.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I crossed my fingers and tried to hold his hand. It was probably the first time since I was in elementary school.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…I don’t know why, but even though we’re just holding hands, I can’t stop my heart from racing. No, my heart has been pounding ever since I stepped into this room, but it’s beating harder…</p>
<p class="calibre4">But&mdash; the goal now was not only to hold hands.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Of course, I couldn’t be happier with my current situation. I wish I could fall asleep in this state.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But more than that, I want to get pleasure from his- Onii-chan’s fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s my life long desire…<br class="calibre2" />
I wish, if these were my Onii-chan’s fingers…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wondered how good it would feel to be touched by him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I’m sorry, just a little…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I whispered a few words and gently pulled his hand towards me.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haan~”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help but gasp from the sheer pleasure. It wasn’t just my lower body. I felt the shock over my whole body.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Such strong simulation… It feels so good…</p>
<p class="calibre4">It was so different from what I usually do with my own fingers. Even when I used a toy, it wasn’t like this.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s close…</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s a little harder to continue doing this. With that in mind, I move his hand up over my pajama to feel his touch on my chest.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Un~ Haa~”</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s a little less simulating, but it’s a lot different than touching myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe it’s because It’s over my pajamas.</p>
<p class="calibre4">How about direct contact? Then I can…</p>
<p class="calibre4">I slowly guide his hand to my stomach. Well, I don’t usually wear underwear at night.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It proved to be helpful in this way.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Han!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">My voice got leaked by the direct touch of his hand which was under my pajamas.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I roll my fingers down there while fiddling his finger with the other. I moan each time his fingers play with my tip.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I keep repeating this over and over again. It started to sound squishy.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I surrendered myself to this extreme pleasure and continued to move my fingers violently…</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;&mdash;I’m&mdash;coming&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Such a climax feels too good. My body twitches as I slowly lose strength.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Haa~ haa~”</p>
<p class="calibre4">My mind is completely blank. I can’t think of anything.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I looked up, I saw his face was very close to me. If I moved my face up a little, I could almost kiss him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I closed my eyes and slowly moved my face closer. As if it was natural, little by little, I got closer and closer until I could feel his breath.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">And then, when I was only a few centimeters away, my brother snorted.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">Is he awake…? Thinking so, I hurriedly withdrew.</p>
<p class="calibre4">What should I do! It’s not just that I snuck into his room, but into his bed too! It’s the end of the world…!</p>
<p class="calibre4">For a moment I thought I should get out of bed. But it would be worse if I made noise by mistake.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I slowly moved out of the bed. Then noticed that he was about to wake up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Oh no… I’ll get caught at this rate.</p>

<p class="calibre4">At that moment I quickly sneak under his bed to hide myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s not the first time I came here.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While setting up the cameras and microphone, and when I came to steal his personal belongings, I have invaded this room many times.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But this was the first time in my life that I had to hide under the bed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I heard a creaking sound. I can’t see what’s going on from here, so the only thing I could rely on was sound.</p>
<p class="calibre4">…Ah. But this place is a little bit better.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Onii-chan is right above me. When I think about it, even though it’s under his bed, for some reason my feelings are uplifted and my heart beats faster.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I didn’t know if it was the excitement of being exposed to my brother or this place.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Eventually, I heard his breathing again. He seemed to have gone back to sleep.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“…hm.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">I breathed a small sigh of relief and got up from under the bed. I really wanted to feel him a little more, but… that’s it for today.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I quickly returned to my room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It was a close call.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">As I lay down on my bed, the scene I had just witnessed came back to my mind. Breathtaking distance from his face. Snuggling close to him. His sleeping face, and those lips.</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Mou~… What should I do? I’m not prepared to face him tomorrow.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">And so, I reimagined his firm touch… That night, it took me almost two hours to fall asleep.</p>
