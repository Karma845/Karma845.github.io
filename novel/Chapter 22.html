<h3>Chapter 22 &#8211; Hunting the Adventurer Killer ②</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Shit!
Shit!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Damn
it!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Where
the hell did that shitty girl go!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
the elf is in a hurry.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">To
break through his growth limit, he had been going around killing human
adventurers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Today,
he attacked Erio and the other human adventurers, but one of them had escaped.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
is a level 1500 elf, and his opponent was probably no more than level 20.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
was so mad, he slashed at them with his treasured sword, and suddenly a light
flashed before his eyes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
the light disappeared, the girl he had been chasing disappeared.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
incident was so unexpected and strange that he was stunned at that place for
more than a minute.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
he realized that he had missed the girl who knew his face, race, features,
physical appearance, and fighting methods, it was already too late.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
hurriedly duplicated Grandius' treasured sword and rode it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
flew around, looking for the girl. But he couldn't find any sign of the runaway
girl.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">While
flying in the sky, he continued to bite his thumb.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"There's
no sign of other people around here. Even if she uses some magic item to
temporarily disappear, there's no way she can escape my detection sense. Maybe
she was using a transfer item to move farther away from here...... No way! Is
she already outside the dungeon! No, no, no, no!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">That's
impossible. There is no way that dirty little girl has such a high-ranking
magic item! If she has it, why didn't she use it right away?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">This
is a situation where her life is at stake.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If Kaito
was in the same situation, he wouldn't hesitate to use even the rarest item.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"...
Maybe that light was just a distraction, and she was just running away from me.
That makes more sense, just like a smoke ball... However, there is no sign of her
presence at all...Argh! Did she go back to her friends???"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
turned his gaze towards the entrance of the dungeon and looked for signs of
life.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If
he is in the same position as the girl, he will head for the entrance of the
dungeon too.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"She's
trying to run back to her friends while pretending that she's escaping to the
dungeon entrance! Then she heals them if they're still alive, gets some more
useful items, and escapes again! Damn it!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Humans
are as weak as bugs, but they are so sneaky!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">After
thinking about it, he didn't finish them off because Miya ran away from him,
and he knew they would die soon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
hurriedly changed his course and headed for the location where Erio and the
others had collapsed.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
is difficult to imagine that a group of young adventurers wandering around the
first level of a dungeon can possess a rare item that allows them to teleport
long distances.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Usually,
these kinds of items are kept by royal families, noblemen, high-level
adventurers, and wealthy merchants to ensure their safety and escape in case of
emergency.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">There
are only a few of these items. They are rare and not even sold at auction.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If
sold, it could fetch enough money for a commoner to live for several decades.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Because
of its rarity, it would be impossible for a novice adventurer to have it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
was more logical to assume that she had managed to escape from his detection
sense.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">By
flying with Grandius' sword, he can return to the original location in less
than a few minutes.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"......Tsk,
she's not here."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Looking
down below him, he sees the boys still lying on the ground. When he looked at
the last boy he fought, he is still faintly breathing. He is the brother of the
girl who escaped. The boy would be dead in a few minutes, but he may be just
right as a decoy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
looks around the area from the air, but no one is around.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Not
here...... She's not here. If so, where the hell did that little bitch go? Did
she really teleport with a long-distance transfer magic item?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">That's
impossible! <span>Why does such a filthy girl have a rare item
that even the White Knights doesn't have!</span><span>??"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However,
if Kaito himself hadn't found her after searching so far, the only thing he
could think of is that she escaped with the transfer item.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">In
other words, it's only a matter of time before his home country discovers that
he's been killing adventurers inside the dungeon.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">His
home country is a country ruled by an elf queen for generations.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
has stolen the treasured sword Grandius to break through his growth limit.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
Elf Queen country is currently on a full-scale manhunt to find Kaito, the man
who stole the treasure sword. To escape from the investigators, he chose to
enter a dungeon near the border between the Elves and the Dwarves country.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
decided to stay in the dungeon until he breaks through his growth limit while
avoiding the eyes of the investigators.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">However, by letting Miya
escape, his home country will surely find out that Kaito is killing adventurers
inside this dungeon.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The Elf Queen country will
deploy their strongest forces to retrieve the treasured sword Grandius, prevent
their country's scandal from being exposed.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Tsk!?</span></span><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The White
Knights...worst-case scenario that damned Commander will come here!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
remembers his former superior's face, and he shivers with fear as he clicks his
tongue.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Rumor
said that the level of the leader of the White Knights is over 3000. Such a
leader will bring a group of knights with levels over 2,000 and 1,500. Each of
them has weapons and armor comparable to the treasured sword Grandius.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
will be executed to destroy the evidence without any chance to fight back.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Shit!</span></span><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Shit!</span></span><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Shit! I am the future hero.
I shouldn't be killed in a place like this! I have to get out of the dungeon
and move to another country. With the Grandius' flying ability, there are
practically no borders! Next, should I go to a human kingdom? No, I better move
to the demon race territory to get some distance from the Elf Queen Country."</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
there's no way out for you."</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"!?"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
Kaito asked himself that question, a voice answered him with an ominous tone
that was dignified and clear, yet heavier and darker than coal tar.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Surprised,
he hurriedly distanced himself from the voice's owner.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
he realized it, he sees a group of people that looked familiar standing there.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">One
of them is wearing golden full-body armor and taller than Kaito.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Another
is a beautiful young girl with a scarf covering her mouth. The girl's face is
so beautiful that it can be seen even in the dark.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
last one is a boy in a black robe and wearing a clown mask.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(How
did these guys get so close to me?</span></span><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
surrounding area is grassland with nowhere to hide. I may not notice the women
and children, but there's no way I didn't notice a shiny golden knight
approaching me! Did they approach me from the sky while hiding their presence?
But even so, there's no way I, a man with level 1500, can't notice them. So how
did......)</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Until
now, Kaito attacked the adventurers without sound or being detected. But this
time, the situation reversed. But he couldn't understand how they did it.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
doesn't know that they were using a combination of the Infinite Gacha, SR -
Flight, and SSR - Presence Concealment cards, a technique more advanced than
his own.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
boy in front of him started to speak.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"If
I look closely, you're the guy I warned against. He was trying to cut in when
we first came to this dungeon. I never expect that you are the adventurer
killer... "</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Oo!
No wonder he looks familiar! My Lord, that was almost a month ago!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"As
expected, Dark-sama! You have a wonderful memory!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">A
boy called "Dark" is reminding them about their previous encounter.
The golden knight and a girl who looks like a fairy queen praise him all at
once.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
remembered them when the boy pointed out about their first encounter.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(Aaa!</span></span><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Those rude Humans who warned
me when I first came to this dungeon!?)</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
reminds him of the humiliation he suffered about a month ago. It also reminds
him of his lust for the beautiful girl, whose beauty he had never seen even in
the Elf Queen Country. He has been thinking of taking the silver-haired brown
woman as his personal maid.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">His
body instantly heated up with excitement and lust, but he didn't want to waste
time on them right now.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"You
seem to have misunderstood something, but I didn't do any of this. I noticed
something is wrong, and when I approached to check it out, it was already like
this. I want you to stop treating me like a criminal."</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No
need to make up such a bad lie. We already secured Miya-chan, and she told us
the details, so we just came to catch you."</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Miya......?"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
seemed to remember the name of the human girl he had just missed.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
he heard the masked boy's words, the expression on his face changed.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Then
suddenly, Kaito smiles happily.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Lucky......
I am so lucky I am! Hehehe, hahaha! I didn't think that some idiot who knows
the whereabouts of that runaway human bitch would show up in front of me! I am
so lucky! After all, I am a future hero loved by the Goddess!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Hero?
No, you're not a hero."</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
boy denied Kaito's words.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
responded to the boy's words and stared at him.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
boy continues to speak from beneath his mask.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"You're
just a stepping stone to raise our adventurer rank. Don't worry. We already
have the evidence to prove to the guild that you are responsible for the
Adventurers Killing. I'm going to kill you with my own hands, right here, right
now. I won't let you live, not after what you've done to Erio and the other
humans."</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Then
the boy took out a card and muttered the word "release".</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">At
the same time, a light wrapped Erio and the others, giving them a recovery
effect and protect them.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Of
course, Gold and Nemumu in the back won't help me. Do you two understand? Ah,
but if this Adventurer-Killer tries to escape, you can interfere."</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Mm,
Roger that, my Lord!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"As
you wish, Dark-sama."</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Gold
and Nemumu behind me answer casually.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito's
pride is hurt by their replies.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"...
Mm, I am the future hero, and you humans are bug, how dare you say that you
won't let me live!?...... I'll kill you. I will peel off your skin alive, stuff
it in your mouth, and cut off your feet!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
is furious, and his blood is rushed to his head. He raised his fantasy class
treasure sword, Grandius.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
boy in a black robe holds a wand in his hand and laughs softly behind his mask.</span></span></p></div>
