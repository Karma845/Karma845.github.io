<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;Thank you for purchasing this work.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If you are reading this afterword, the author is probably worrying about the manuscript for volume three.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I once had thought long ago that I would like to start my writing with such a beginning, so I decided to start this time with such a beginning. My name is Akari Hino, the author.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Probably the majority of you have read the first volume before reading this second volume, but there is one thing that the author expects that you must have had this impression after comparing the two volumes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Not at all erotic? Isn't it too thin this book?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Sorry about that. It was less this time due to the scale and the atmosphere of the work. ......!</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since there were two new characters, I decided to keep the content of the play orthodox, as well as to show their faces. In the third volume, I hope to write a lot of erotic parts where the relationship has progressed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;One of the reasons for the lack of erotica in this volume is that it is a little different from the production stance I have taken in the past.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This is based on a story that was originally published on Nocturne Novels, an external site of Novelist.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's a so-called "18 bans" site, a place where works with sensuality as their main purpose are published.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The title was a bit more direct: "A Dungeon Harem with Elf Sex Slaves: Since the sexual situation in another world seems to be lagging behind, I'm going to increase the number of my friends by sleeping with them".</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;All of my previous works have been constructed as stories for erotica since that is where I am active.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Situations are essential to eroticism, but I have a way of creating the inevitability of eroticism and situations throughout the entire work, rather than just suddenly inserting eroticism.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since the work was created in this way and was highly evaluated, I intend to maintain the same stance in the future, but I also felt it was my duty to improve the completeness of the story as a story without eroticism.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After all, the battlefield is different. Inevitably, the readership is also different. Moreover, since I was paid for the publication of this work, I have a different responsibility than I do on the Web, where I can write whatever I want.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Dash-X Bunko is not a label for sensual novels, so our basic premise is to make it work as a light novel product.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In that sense, this is the first time I have tried to make a commercial product and to make it an entertainment product.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even now, as I write this, there is a sense of uneasiness that I may have abandoned one of my strengths.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, the erotic part is the part where the story doesn't progress and the tempo is slow &#8213; in other words, it is a part that can be considered unnecessary.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When you want to read the story as quickly as possible, many of you may feel that the erotic parts of the story are interrupted by the erotic parts of the story.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It may be easy to understand if we say it is like the feeling of a serial spurt in a gag comic.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the first volume, the eroticism was concentrated around the middle and the latter half of the story so as not to spoil the tempo as much as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The structure of the first volume is such that it is difficult to understand the main plot if there is eroticism in between the explanations of the premise.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since I wrote this afterword on the assumption that the reader has already read the first volume, there was no need to explain the premise of the stage setting, so I sporadically sprinkled in some erotica.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I am not sure at the time of writing whether it turned out to be a good thing or a bad thing, and the author has yet to figure out just the right balance.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was somewhat of an experiment, but I hope you enjoyed it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Many people worked very hard on this project.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The editors who have been with me from the planning stage, Neibi, who has exceeded my expectations with her illustrations even under a tight schedule, and my readers.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is thanks to you, the readers, that I am able to write this afterword.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In a world where many works cannot be continued even if they wanted to, I was able to experience the precious experience of a reprint.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I would be very happy if you would support us for future volumes.</p>
