<h3>Chapter 19</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;Leave the dragons to me! Everyone else, get the undead!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Ulysse and the others died.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The &#12302;Absolute Protected Area&#12303; that had surrounded them was gone, the flames had gone up, and everyone understood it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They also understood that there was no time to be sad.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They themselves might be like that in a few minutes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars began to throw his magic weapon, which he had spread out like a camp, at the Dragon Zombie.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If the body is so fragile that it cannot even withstand its own movement and mass, there is a good chance that it can be dropped if the sword keeps hitting the skin membrane of its wings.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He throws the first sword with three times the force of his previous limit, followed by the second and the third.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He used both arms to avoid showing any opening.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he threw the sword, there was a cracking sound as if a fighter plane had passed through the air.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">BAM!&nbsp;</span>The magic swords with attributes of fire and lightning that hit the Dragon's torso penetrated the Dragon's body, and with their momentum, pierced through the Dragon's body and into the far high ceiling.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Its belly, wings, and head were each destroyed by one sword.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It worked. ......!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Along with the unimaginable battle results, unimaginable damage covers Mars' entire body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Both of his arms will not be of proper use for a while.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mars-san! We were able to defeat the undead to some extent, only Norn left!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hurry up and get her-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I will come with you!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With Lilia working together to stall, Nemu destroying them with her voice, and Hazuki incinerating, the majority of the undead had been successfully neutralized.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Only Norn remains. But that Norn alone, however, is above all the forces.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There is a <span style="font-style: italic;">sharan, sharan</span>, sound.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He looked at the source of the sound, the pyramid, and saw that Norn was slowly descending the stairs toward Mars and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre"><br /></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Why, are you interrupting me.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Can you talk ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Why are you interrupting? Because of you, I lost most of my power.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Repeating the same words over and over, Norn approaches.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She is speaking, but it is doubtful that she can hold a conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She looks like a young woman. However, she is not human.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her hair is pitch black, her skin is too white like wax, and her eyes are as murky as the water in drainage, which is more than enough to express her madness.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hateful. Hateful. Why aren't you people leaving me alone?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I am jealous ...... why am I the only one that is unhappy. You people have made me alone again.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars stifles the pain and readies his sword.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Norn seemed to be a special kind of undead, but she didn't seem at all interested in having a conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There would be no such thing as persuasion, and the curse of the Hazuki clan would not be broken unless she was destroyed after all.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I only want to revive the one I had longed for. And yet that's all there is to it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She continues to mumble and mumble quickly. She did not seem to be rational.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars understands her motives. He understood why she was recreating the city. She had a place for her lovers to return to.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;First of all, even the Norns are undead. Her instinct is hatred and jealousy toward the living.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I can use necromancy, so what's wrong with using it? The law? Don't be silly. This is my village, so I decide. And yet, yet, yet! You have killed me!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He braces himself against the suddenly agitated Norn.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He doesn't know if she was always like this, but she's not the type to be moved by sudden emotional outbursts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ahahaha! So I made him suffer the same! The curse of not being able to make a loved one and having their blood run out!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's enough. &#8213;&#8213;Let's end this.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She may have been a pathetic victim at first, but now Norn is a danger to indiscriminately increase the death toll.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;More than anyone else, Mars thought, the person who should be freed the most is Norn herself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is beyond pitiful to think that she has been thinking about the same person for so long that it has become a fairy tale, and that she is driven only by negative emotions such as revenge and jealousy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The great sinner, the necromancer Norn. It is I, your descendent, who will kill you! Mars-san, I'll take care of her here!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Are you sure!? As a magician, Norn is more ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars wonders if Hazuki can compete with such a powerful magician.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars worries, Lilia puts her hand on his shoulder.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No problem. &#8213;&#8213;Norn has almost no magic power. She must have poured everything she had into becoming undead. I don't know how many thousands there were in the entire dungeon, but as long as Norn is an undead who doesn't recover naturally, she's already depleted. The attack itself was depleting her strength.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Let me avenge my father and mother! Red Lotus Formation &#12302;White Flame Funeral&#12303;!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The final result was a simple one.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Norn showed no resistance and burned up.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They could not hear her voice, but they all felt as if her mouths had moved to say thank you.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Norn herself must have had her soul trapped by necromancy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even so, she could not stop.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Love is also a kind of curse. For Norn, necromancy is a curse of love that makes no one happy.</p>
