<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;The first thing I thought about when I woke up was the meaning of my rebirth.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I wondered what kind of miracle had caused me to be reborn in a world that was apparently a different world.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I asked myself if there was something I should do, but no one answered.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It seems that I am not given a role to save the world or anything like that.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;My next thought was about my previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Maybe it was the immature brain of an infant, or maybe it was simply the lack of events that I could recall, but I couldn't find a single hot one, and none were on the back of my mind.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;Yeah, I didn't get anything done in my previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I couldn't find anything important, I couldn't protect anything.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The mundane things I had avoided, thinking I was smart, thinking I understood, were the things I really needed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The life I thought I was living was nothing but a waste of time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When I realized this, I felt that my former life had really died inside me.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;This is a punishment.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars Irving came into this world with a strong sense that the crying of a baby right after birth is probably due to regret, sadness, loneliness, and emptiness.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;I will live this life with no regrets.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The phrase "no regrets, no regrets" does not apply to me, who was reborn with the consciousness of my previous life.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The next time I die and am reborn, I will live my life so that I can be proud of myself and say that my previous life would have been a good one.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213; To live is to continue to be involved in something.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Whether it is a person or an event, to continue to be in touch with something that moves you is life.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The day he realizes that this is similar to traveling, he takes up the sword.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He doesn't want to be a hero. It is not that he was given such a vessel.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He wants to live with the one he loves</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He knew on the day he was born that he needed the power to do so.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The hope that was born from the mesh of miracles was mundane, boring, and commonplace.</p>
