<h3>Chapter 16</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who had begun to weep raggedly, showed no sign of wariness.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was not surprising, since in front of her were her parents, who had been separated for more than ten years.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;N-NO, NO......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Hazuki! Get your act together! Stand up and fight!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia gives notice to Hazuki, who has cowered in place.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She knows these are cruel words. But they are essentially the same as before.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;The undead will not turn back into human beings.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This is a problem that cannot be solved no matter how they try.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hazuki, I won't allow you to become like that too!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But, because, they're my dad and mom. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Not anymore!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia continues to throw harsh words, her eyes red.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If they are dragged down by their emotions, not only Hazuki, but everyone is in danger.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Can I beat them?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Shouldn't Hazuki-chan get over it by herself?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars is troubled and postpones his conclusion.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu-chan, Julis-san! Help me hold them down!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki had no choice but to join the battle, and Lilia thought it would be impossible for her to join the battle.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is clear that Hazuki is important to Lilia, even though they seem to be fighting all the time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her high level of sensitivity is being avenged only this time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;I think it would be better for both of them to take shelter in Lilia's treasury than to be shown a cruel scene.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The armored undead &#8213; Hazuki's father &#8213; swings his two-handed long sword to stop Mars and the others from moving.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Each sword is heavy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars catches it with his sword, but even though he thinks he moves optimally, the impact is so great that he is pushed back.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's father moves so fast that it is hard to believe that he is a large man in armor.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He closes the distance rapidly with his strong legs, and then he uses his long reach to bring out his long sword.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;His movements are based on his physical strength, but because of their simplicity, they are difficult to counter.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even so, there are plenty of ways to counter it if the premise is to destroy it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars could concentrate on destroying arms, legs, and other parts of his body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But the thought of being Hazuki's father dulls both his thoughts and his sword.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Kughh ......! The speed of magic is fast! Be careful, Nemu!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyaaaa! Okay-nya!? Can we beat them-nya!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars ordered them to hold them down, but they all knew that would not solve anything.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's magical talent seemed to have been inherited from her mother, and the moment she pointed her wand at Mars and the rest, a magical heat ray grazed Julis and Nemu. There was almost no lag.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Everyone was confused.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The only one who remained calm was Julis.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her short time with Hazuki was a blessing in disguise as a result.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Take her cane or destroy it!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;W-What should Nemu does-nya!? Nemu doesn't know difficult thing-nya!? Tell me-nya?!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Use your voice magic!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#12302;Nyaaaaah!&#12303;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu shouts loudly at Hazuki's mother's undead.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The air vibrates, chattering, and her entire right arm and wand disintegrate.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If Nemu had wanted to, she could have destroyed the whole body in the same way, but that was probably not Nemu's intention.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I'll do it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Stepping in with a <span style="font-style: italic;">thump</span>, Julis charged with the sword that Mars had given her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If there were any undead left who were highly skilled in magic, they could be wiped out in a matter of seconds.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If we think calmly, we have no choice but to do it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;W-wait-nya! Julis shouldn't do this-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;W-What are you trying to say!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu jumps on Julis and pushes her to Hazuki and Lilia, who is crying behind.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She then picks up Hazuki's cane, which had fallen to the ground, and slaps Hazuki in the face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hazuki-nyan, you do it-nya! Nemu doesn't know how difficult it is, but maybe others shouldn't do it-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu-chan ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who was slapped on the cheek, widened her eyes and looks up at Nemu.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu, the one who had slapped Hazuki, was also crying.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At this point, everyone understood that Hazuki had to do it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hazuki. I understand that you are in pain. I understand that you want to cry. Because such a reunion is too cruel, and I know you want to curse the world. But not now.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Julis-san, can you do the &#12304;Absolute Protected Area&#12305; magic for me? &#8213;&#8213;I'll do it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia and Nemu support Hazuki as she slowly wobbles to her feet.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her trembling legs are painful.</p>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;Keep your distance and go back! Give me five more seconds&#8213;&#8213;wait three seconds!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With the girls' attention focused on Hazuki, Mars takes care of Hazuki's parents.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The mother had lost her wand and her magical ability level had dropped considerably, but the father was as strong as ever.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When it was two against one, and they were not to be beaten, even Mars was not likely to last long.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the midst of the battle, Hazuki's mother's silver pendant was bothering him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Kicking the father's side as hard as he could, Mars leaped toward the mother and took the pendant from her without harming it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Then, as soon as he landed, he headed toward Hazuki and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#12302;Absolute Protected Area&#12303;! &#8213;&#8213;It won't last long.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A magical dome three meters in diameter is created and every one enters it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who had been standing supported, stepped forward.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Okay. I'm sorry for the trouble I've caused you all! &#8213;&#8213;I am a member of the Tomb Guard's clan. My father and mother are watching. I have to do it, don't I?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The undead of Hazuki's parents approaches before her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There would be no shadows to be seen, and their sight seeking the living was pitiful.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I will use the last magic that my mom and dad taught me a long time ago before they came here. I couldn't do it well at all then. &#8213;I promised them. I promised them that I would be able to use it properly the next time they came back. I'll show them. That's why ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;From Mars and the others, all they could see was the back of Hazuki's head.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars knew she was crying. Because her voice was trembling loudly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki put her own hand in the palm of her mother's hand, which was hitting the &#12302;Absolute Protected Area&#12303;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They were about the same size.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I've grown up too, haven't I? ...... When I last saw her, my hand was about half the size of my mother's palm.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The Protected Area is only maintained for around a minute or so.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There is no time to spare. But no one was going to stop this parting.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Dad, Mom. I have grown up. I have friends and someone I love. I can't cook well, but I've become very good at sewing.&#12288;Even my magic is as good as Mom. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki turns her head and her voice gets quieter and quieter.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Tears were falling at her feet.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The truth is, I'm still a little lonely, but I'm okay now.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They say that the undead has souls trapped in them before their re-birth.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki said that the reason they can use their skills and magic as they are is because they still have those experiences.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Red Lotus Formation &#12302;White Flame Purification Funeral&#12303; ...... Good night, Dad. Mom.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With Hazuki at the center, a pure white flame, flickering like an aurora borealis, spreads out.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The undead of Hazuki's parents, who instantly burned and collapsed, seemed to smile at the end.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The white flame disappears, and the &#12302;Absolute Protected Area&#12303; also disappears.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There is no trace of her parents' undead anywhere anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Only Hazuki, who would have been their precious child, was the only trace they left in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Let's move on. I'm glad I got to say goodbye to them for the last time.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, with bright red eyes, spins around and smiles in her usual cheerful tone.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is obvious to everyone that she is pushing herself too hard.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They all look gloomy, so she is probably trying not to make it any darker.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia hugs such a pained Hazuki, makes her nuzzle her face against her chest and says</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's okay to cry. You are usually so honest about your desires, but you shouldn't hold back at a time like this.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Fue, uuhh, uueeeeehhnnnn! &nbsp;Daaaadd! Moooommmmmm!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Clinging to Lilia, Hazuki cried loudly.</p>
