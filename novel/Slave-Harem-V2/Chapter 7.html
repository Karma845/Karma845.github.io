<h3>Chapter 7</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;Our lifeline is Hazuki-chan.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Eh, the fate of the world is in my hands!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;*silence*</span> The air was quiet, and Hazuki was embarrassed that she had slipped up.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was not the time for joking around, but Hazuki was still going at her own pace.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I envy your peaceful brain. &#8213;I'm sure you're the only one who can use magic that can burn a wide area. I, Master, and Nemu can only use fighting methods that leave the original form no matter what, and the range is very narrow.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's what I mean. So we're going to support Hazuki-chan. And the timing of our break depends on Hazuki-chan's magic.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu doesn't want to touch <span style="font-style: italic;">zuruzuru</span> too much-nya ......, she doesn't want to become squishy-nya&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if you can kill a living monster, it will come back to life, so the most important thing is to dispose of the corpse.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars cannot use offensive magic at all because all resources have been allocated in a game-like manner to several body manipulation magic, including &#12302;Body Strengthening&#12303;.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia can also use offensive magic, but her basic resources are allocated to archery, and like Mars, she is mainly physical, so she is not suitable for zombies.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu is another physical specialization talent.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If they are coming to feed on magic, the most likely target for the undead will be this pervert woman. It's quite reasonable for us to support you.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;......? Doesn't that mean you are indirectly using me as bait!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia smiles wryly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Of course, Hazuki knew that she was joking, so the atmosphere did not turn bad.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Let's practice the new formation and bury the undead. &#8213;&#8213;Oh, that reminds me, Hazuki-chan's &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305; magic, can't we use that? It consumes very little magic power, right?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ah, that plain magic.....Even though I was expecting more boom, kaboom, but it's just nyurururun.....!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I don't get that last onomatopoeia!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki kicks a pebble and appeals with all her might that she is dissatisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What was contained in the &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book] she received was magic to amplify magic power.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It can be used not only on oneself but also on others. Incidentally, it does not duplicate.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki was not so pleased with this cheat-like magic, which can increase the magic power that has a fixed potential capacity, for the reason that there is no change in the appearance of the magic.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nevertheless, she understands its usefulness itself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Magic of magic power amplification would be very powerful. To use a numerical analogy, it is possible to produce a hundred magical powers with the consumption of one magical power. It is truly magic suitable for the &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But-but, even if you use it, it looks totally plain! It's just a hint of warmness!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'll have you put that magic on me when the time comes. Or rather, all of you.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Certainly!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Instead of joining the conversation, Nemu glanced at Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She seemed to want to say something but was unable to say it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyaa...... Nemu has been silent about something, but you don't get angry-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm not going to get mad at you, okay? What's wrong?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu too-nyaa? She can use the magic of that &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305;-nya ...... Sorry for not telling you-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Eh!? What kind?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It would be faster if Nemu showed it to you-nya. She can't say it well-nya. &#8213;&#8213;&#12302;Nya!&#12303;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The air trembled as Nemu gave a small shout.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But to Mars and others, it sounded like a normal voice with a normal volume.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But in the direction Nemu was facing, the wall in the distance was crumbling.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Rather than a sound, it felt strange, as if a huge mass of air had moved.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Sound is vibration. In other words, it was a directional shock wave.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu can attack far away with her voice-nya. The sound was small, but it would be much more powerful if she was serious-nya. What else-nya? Nemu has good hearing, so she can vaguely see the terrain and the location of the enemy by the sound of the bouncing sound-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Sonar......!? You know, the kind bats and stuff use.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What's that Sonya-nya? From the other side of the road, there are more zuruzuru than the number of fingers on Nemu's hand-nya&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars nodded, thinking that she probably meant around ten zombies, as she held out her hands to show them off.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu can apparently only count to the number of hands.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even a voice is a fine means of attack if it is powerful enough to destroy rocks.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Another very useful method is to use the ears as sonar using echoes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is also very useful for mapping the entire area without moving when entering a new floor.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master, even I could understand the echoes. It makes mapping a lot easier.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Based on the lessons learned last time, Lilia is in charge of mapping this time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This is to avoid walking the same places over and over again in vain.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who has an unusual talent for calculation, assists with detailed numbers.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I think it's a very useful ability if you use it. &#8213;Why did you think I was going to get mad at you? I rather wish you had said that earlier.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Because ...... this is a book that Nemu took the liberty of taking from splendor room so she could use it-nya. Nemu can't read but she can-nya. N-Nemu didn't try to steal it-nya!? She just opened the paper book to take a look at it-nya! B-but stealing gets your hands cut off-nya. ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu was puzzled with her ears down as she <span style="font-style: italic;">poke-poke</span> the fingers of both hands together.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, that's what you mean. Stealing is bad, but even Nemu-chan has the right to receive it since you beat the boss and conquered the dungeon. Besides, it's your magic now.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu kept quiet out of guilt.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Stealing is a very serious crime in this world. It is common for ordinary people to have their hands cut off to prevent them from ever doing it again, and even more so if they are slaves. There is no such thing as the belief that human nature is fundamentally good in this world; the view of human nature as fundamentally depraved rules the world, and you are not given a chance for rehabilitation or a second chance.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu was convinced that this was the case, and she was also convinced that Mars would be furious if he knew that she had stolen.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But Mars does not see it as stealing. Or rather, he thinks of it as a reward for the conquering, which is not enough.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No worries. From what I've heard, it doesn't sound like you had any malicious intent, and from my point of view, I'd rather praise you for it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu does a good thing-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia praises Nemu for reducing Kruse's strength.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It seemed like some kind of wrong educational policy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's in that direction, right? Then let's burn the whole aisle!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You sound like a dangerous person when you speak, you know? But I'm counting on you.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki held out her staff in the direction Nemu said the zombies were following.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Red Lance Formation &#12302;Flame Spear Funeral&#12303;!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The range is narrow, and the flames extend in a straight line.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was not a magic that burned up a wide area, but one that emphasized penetration.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Once ignited, the flames spread along the passage, causing the fire to spread.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#12302;Nyaa!&#12303;&#8213;&#8213;<span style="font-style: italic;">It looks like it's all on fire-nya!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu said, her voice rising and her ears twitching.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The echoing sound seemed to indicate that nothing was moving.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;After all it is useful, that's power!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Amazing!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Continue to detect and attack from a distance ...... this is quite efficient, isn't it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The four of them were surprised by the existence of zombies and panicked, but they regained their composure after determining the cause of the zombies and how to deal with them. Above all, they were glad to be able to defeat them without seeing them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is Nemu amazing-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You're amazing. If Nemu-chan uses that magic, we'll be able to proceed quite safely.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;...... happy-nyaa? Will Nemu get more praise if she works harder-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes. But don't hold on to someone's neck just because you were surprised as you were earlier. You would have killed your friends.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia looks at Nemu, who is itching to do so with joy and rubs her neck, and laughs.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She hasn't quite forgotten the shock of Nemu hanging around Lilia's neck when Nemu was attacked by a zombie's wrist.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Shall we annihilate this layer? I'd like to discuss how to proceed on that one.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We might be defenseless when we come out from the Treasure House of Dreams. ......I might want to defeat the monsters as much as possible.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;As time goes by, if there are no monsters in the layer over time, there's no problem.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The subspace &#12302;Treasury House of Dreams&#12303; is safe when inside, but time passes the same as outside. It is only the time of objects that do not progress.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if you are safe when you enter, it is not impossible that you may be in the middle of a group of monsters when you come out.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Therefore, they want to enter after securing a safe place as much as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After a week of exploring this layer, they all descended to the next layer.</p>
