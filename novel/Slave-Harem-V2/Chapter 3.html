<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;She seems all right?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes. She has bruises all over her body and countless fresh wounds, but nothing life-threatening. The large bruise on her neck can be healed.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Good. &#8213;I didn't think Lilia would appeal to me to help her.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Did I bother you. ......? I'm sorry I made you spend that much money.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia looks guilty, so Mars shakes his head and appeals to Lilia that she is not responsible.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It doesn't bother me. I wanted the company, and Lilia's words helped me make up my mind. The money is totally fine. I originally planned to spend it all or donate it before entering the dungeon. Because leaving the money in the treasury won't help me in the dungeon.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Well,.........If you die in a dungeon, it doesn't matter how much money you have, it's meaningless&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;As long as we have enough money for our immediate needs, it doesn't matter how much more we have. It's far more meaningful to bring in enough food for the space we'd leave our money in.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Instead of using &#12304;Treasure House of Dream&#12305; belong to Mars, where it is difficult for people to spend time properly, he will be treating Nemu, the cat-eared girl he just bought, at Lilia's place, which she got in &#12302;Sekhmet&#12303;.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's treasury is also piled to the ceiling with supplies for the dungeon. As a living environment, this one is also undesirable. He felts again that they should stay outside tonight.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;And to be honest, I didn't secretly wonder what it would be like to take on the challenge of the labyrinth with the three of us, so the timing was good. Even better if our personalities match.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Buying a lot of slaves like that prince is an option, but don't you think about that approach?&#12288;&#8213;personally, I'm very much against it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I didn't think about it because I knew Lilia would say so. Besides, it is in my nature to work well together with a small number of people. I'm a small citizen, so it's difficult for me to handle that many slaves, and someone like the prince who just came in, that's a talent of his own. I don't have the talent to be a leader.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If you are only thinking of the most efficient way, disposing of slaves is not a bad option, but that is only if you focus on dungeon capture, and the peace with Lilia that can be obtained in such an inhumane way is guiltily undesirable.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;A fight ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That doesn't seem to be the case. It seems that Nemu is unilaterally turning against the perverted woman.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Isn't that a fight!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars enters the treasury, led by Lilia, he sees Hazuki struggling with Nemu.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki was on horseback on top of Nemu, who was lying on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars thought it was already a fight, but it seems that the situation is a little different.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu is holding Hazuki's face with a fuss as she tries to approach with her cane for a full-fledged healing session.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu's movements were powerful, even though she was even smaller than Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, not Lilia, is mainly in charge of healing, since Hazuki's magical power alone is higher than Lilia's.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There's definitely a bit of a peaceful air about it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If Nemu was serious, the pervert woman would be bleeding profusely right now. Nemu seems to understand that.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't say scary things!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Looking at Nemu up close, he saw that her hair was a whitish light blue and about mid-back in length.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was so shaggy that it could be said to have just grown long, rather than intentionally let it grow long.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her skin is white where there is no mud on it, and her whole body is slender, probably due to lack of nutrition.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The only thing that resembles a cat are her ears and tail, which move freely, and her long double teeth.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-it's okay! I won't do anything painful or terrible!&#12301;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't touch me-nya! I hate humans-nya! And you're heavy-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Agh, o-oww, don't push my face! I-I'm not heavy!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu unhesitatingly pushes on her face in an attempt to pull Hazuki away from her covering.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't worry. That woman is trustworthy, for a change. I am an elf, not a human, so you can trust my word a little, can't you?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Sighing, Lilia crosses her arms under her chest and nudges Nemu.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Humans hate different races, but different races also hate humans.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia knows this well.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyah ...... really-nya? &#8213;&#8213;I shouldn't hit that guy either-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu, her ears flattened, a look of fright in her golden eyes, pointed at Mars as she pushed Hazuki's face away.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was natural for her to be distrustful since she had been almost killed by a human just a few minutes ago.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And it was almost the first time they had met.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;My name is Mars Irving. I won't hit you, so don't worry.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I am Lilia Silvestri. &#8213;Me and that perv&#8213;a woman over there are slaves of our master here. Since you were also bought with such a large sum of money, I hope that you will make every effort to work hard.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Currently, Nemu is not yet a slave of Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, it was Lilia's opinion that she should still be a slave since it is true that she was bought.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Inwardly, she is also jealous of Nemu, who was bought for a higher price than she was.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;M-My name is Hazuki Azathoth,......&#8213;Isn't it time for you to take your hands off my face!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's cute little face was crumpled up when she was pushed hard on her cheek.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It seems that Nemu's force was stronger than expected, and she was half crying.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Because you're going to attack with magic, aren't you!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;T-that's not it! Healing, I'm gonna heal you!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Feeling sorry for Hazuki, who seemed to have been hated so much, Mars rushed to them and pulled them apart.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu is ...... Nemu Nail-nya ...... Age maybe? 15 years old-nya ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;While receiving Hazuki's healing, Nemu, with a scowl on her face, sits down and introduces herself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her tail was drooping as if it had lost its strength.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She said she was fifteen years old, two years younger than Mars and three years younger than Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She had a young physique for her age.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You call yourself 'Nemu' right! Nice to meet you, Nemu-chan!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki mentions Nemu calling herself while rubbing her face with one hand to restore the face that had been pushed away. Her voice is a little sweeter than usual, and the tension is like meeting a relative's child.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;...... are you making fun of me-nya? Nem's stuff is only in her own name, so she takes good care of it-nya. Besides, Nemu like her name a lot-nya&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You're mistaken! I thought it was kind of cute! Should I say "Hazuki is~" too?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Stop it because it's creepy when perv&#8213;Hazuki does it. Nemu, rest assured. From now on, you will have many of your own, and you will be called by that name you love so much&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Unlike Nemu, who seems natural, when Hazuki does it, it comes off as a bit pretentious.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was about to call Hazuki a pervert woman out of habit, but as expected, she seemed to refrain from doing so in front of Nemu.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I can't teach Nemu-chan strange words ...... but there's a pervert woman here</span>.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With compassionate eyes, Lilia said gently, as if admonishing Nemu.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The words did not seem to sit well with Nemu, but Mars and Hazuki could fully understand Lilia's kindness.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As they looked at her, Lilia's face fell in embarrassment.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;First of all, I'll have the two of you heal her wounds, and first she'll have to take a bath and change her clothes. As expected, those clothes are a bit....&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The clothes Nemu wears are more like burlap sacks than clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The slave's clothes were the same size for both adults and children or were shaped like a one-piece dress that went all the way down to their shins.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was a substitute for what could be described as a ragged brown cloth covering.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They were quite dirty and did not look good.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu doesn't want to-nya! Nemu not going to take a bath-nyaa!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu flies to the corner of the room, curls up into a little ball, and starts to squirm.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars is confused by the unexpected refusal.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though she has the features of a cat, she seems to dislike taking a bath more than expected, even though she basically looks like a human.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;When water is poured over Nemu's head, Nemu feels like she's going to die from the cold-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;...... water?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars and Hazuki looked at her with question marks, but Lilia, who was once a slave, knew what it was like.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Slaves rarely bathe properly. This is true for humans, but even more so for different races.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They are treated no differently from animals.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That is why they were treated roughly, more like washing than bathing, by simply pouring water over their heads in the open air.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;This will never happen again. You wash yourself with warm water.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You want to boil Nemu in hot water-nya!? Nemu probably doesn't taste good-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I already told you ......&#8213;It is troublesome. Let's make her feel it. Master, can you help me? I would like you to bathe in the hot water with her if possible.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At Lilia's urging, Mars decides to take Nemu to the bathhouse, and gently strangle Nemu.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was the only way to restrain the rampaging Nemu.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm going to hit you, after all-nya!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Sorry! But we're just going to take a bath! I mean, that's a lot of power you have, aren't you!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As Mars holds Nemu down, Hazuki puts her cane on Nemu's forehead.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu's eyes start to glaze over.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She looks as if she can't hold back her sleepiness.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What did you do, Hazuki-chan?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It is calming magic. It's useful when you can't sleep at night. It makes you feel really sleepy, you know?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't use it on strangers, all right ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;It's too scary magic. It's supposed to cloud other people's consciousness.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He also found Hazuki a little scary, using it on Nemu without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, Hazuki's face showed no trace of malice, and she seemed to be acting out of the goodness of her heart.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There is no reason to strangle Nemu, who is about to fall asleep, so he changes to a princess carry.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He felt that her small, light body didn't even weigh half as much as Hazuki's.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;By the way, do I need to take a bath with her? She had become a lot more docile, and I'm not comfortable with the idea of bath together with a girl I'd never met before.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Please join us. We can't handle it if things get out of control.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia and Hazuki are indeed unlikely to be able to stop Nemu from going on a serious rampage.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At present, they have not obtained Nemu's consent, so it is uncertain whether they will make her a slave or not, but considering the balance of the party, Mars would be grateful if she would join them.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;But won't she suddenly mistrust me by taking a bath with me?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he has some doubts, Lilia gives him an answer, which he guessed from her expression.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu probably won't mind. First of all, I don't feel any sense of shame from Nemu. And since Nemu does not react particularly when touched by Master, I assume that the mating season has not yet arrived. It is too indifferent, I guess. I think if she knew this and that about men and women like that, she would respond differently when touched by the opposite sex. Perhaps she is stunted due to malnutrition from childhood. First of all, the original beastmen are considerably larger than humans, regardless of gender. Nemu is smaller than humans, so that kind of growth is probably delayed as well&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mating season?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Not only beastmen, well, elves have them too, but ...... many of the different races have a definite mating season, unlike humans&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia says with a shy face. She is embarrassed because it is as if she is saying that the lasciviousness Lilia usually shows is different from the mating season.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In fact, the mating season for elves is so common that it comes once a year.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The norm for elves is to live a thousand years and have one child or not.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Usually, the longer a creature lives, the fewer offspring it leaves behind. This is because each individual does not need to produce many offspring in order to live a long life. Even elves, who live much longer than humans, are no exception to this rule.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm looking forward to Lilia's mating season. ...... I wonder what it will be like.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It may be unseemly. So far it has only been a little tingling, but ...... now. &#8213;&#8213;It's the master's fault, you know?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Looking into the moist eyes of the upper gaze, Mars felt like he was going to be sucked in, so Mars hurriedly averted his face to cover it up.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;T-that reminds me, are you hungry?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;You dodge that issue. Well, it's not that kind of situation, so it's okay. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Out of the corner of Mars's eye, he saw Lilia's lips twitching, but he couldn't help but be charmed by the sight of her too much.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki was holding another set of clothes in addition to her own, watching Nemu's tail wag in Mars' arms.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Whenever it swung from side to side, their gazes swam in sync.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I feel like I'm in mating season all year round. ......! I'm so horny! &#8213;&#8213;Wait, that's not it! I wanted to talk about using my clothes as a change of clothes for Nemu for the time being. It might be a little big, but...&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In terms of height, Lilia, Hazuki, and Nemu are larger in that order.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In that sense, Hazuki's clothes are closest to Nemu's size,...... but, not wanting to say anything, Mars closes his mouth and talks about his future plans.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We should buy clothes as well as supplies in this town. We can spend all the money we have because it takes up a lot of space.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then I'd love to go on a food tour! There's some really good stuff here! You know, the kind where it's meat wrapped in meat, wrapped with cheese, and then wrapped in more meat! It's a great dish where the meats are cooked a little differently and taste a little differently, and they are making out with each other!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia, whose staple food is vegetables, squints her eyes, but the meat-eating girl's Hazuki is enraptured.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What's that? That sounds delicious, doesn't it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He heads for the bathroom with a dozing Nemu.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The bathroom in the Treasure House of Dream is spacious, about 14 tatami mats in size, including the dressing room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The room used as the bedroom and the storage room is the same size, and the living room in the center is twice that size.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu was slowly regaining consciousness on the way there, but she glanced at Mars' face and slowly turned her head away while she was being carried like a princess. She did not seem to sense any hostility from Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu rubbed her eyes and stood up as Mars lowered her to a chair in the changing room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Come on, let's get undressed. There's nothing to be afraid of.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyaa......Nemu doesn't want to take a bath after all-nya......Nemu doesn't mind leaving it like this-nya. It's just a little itchy-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even at a quick glance, Nemu is dirty with mud and sand.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's unsanitary, much less scratchy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's eyes narrowed, and her words became more forceful as she held out her index finger in front of Nemu's face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We are not allowed that. You can't go into any store in that condition. Besides, because we are of a different race, we have to keep our appearance clean. It is because we don't do so that we are insulted for being rude or a monster. If you are clean and look confident, you will be fine.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Surprisingly, there were few cases of refusal if they did so even in high-class restaurants.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia is well aware of this from her travels with Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu doesn't understand-nya ...... Nemu doesn't know any complicated words. &#8213;&#8213;Soiya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia admonishes Mars with just her eyes as he almost blurts out that response.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars told her he was sorry with a gesture, Lilia also laughed a little and explained the meaning of her words to Nemu.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's rude, rude. It means vulgar&#12301; <span style="font-style: italic;">[TLN: Lilia is saying these words 粗野/Soya, it means rustic/rude/vulgar/rough/, but Nemu say it with Soiya</span>]</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu was vulgar-nya ......!&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;What is "Vulgar"?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;W-Well, we are talking about keeping it clean. You are a girl, too, so it's extra(?)&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;If you're a slave, you don't get an education.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars thinks a little about the future, wondering if we should teach ourselves what we need to know.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Maybe one day he can build a school.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since there are few schools that the common people can easily attend, the educational level of each individual is extremely dependent on the environment in which he or she was born.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He had not educated children before, but he does remember receiving them, so he guessed he can do some of it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Thinking that sharing knowledge is important, Lilia took off Nemu's clothes without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Sand and mud were scattered from the dirty burlap sack clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The way she removed Nemu's clothes was like a mother doing it to her child.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Perhaps it was the camaraderie of different races, but Nemu did not resist Lilia much.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who felt that Nemu did not like her very much, was preparing for a bath in the bathroom with her clothes on.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu, you have breasts for your childlike physique. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu's body is exposed when Leia removes the loose one-piece burlap sack.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu was not wearing any kind of underwear.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although smaller in height than Lilia and Hazuki &#8213; a full head shorter than Lilia &#8213; her body showed ample maturity.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, the base of her body itself is quite thin, with showing ribs. Her arms and legs are also quite thin.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Despite such a small amount of fat that her ribs show, her breasts are of a size that even an adult hand might not be able to hold.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her pink nipples pointed upward as if defying gravity.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The lower half of her body was slightly immature, with a softly bulging crack that was tightly closed and no pubic hair.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her body had both girlishness and mature femininity.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Th-This is quite ......!</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;No, no, no, that's not what this is about right now, me!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Without comment, Mars absentmindedly brushed away the mud and sand from the floor with the broom.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia-nyan? You have a collar on your neck-nya. Is it in the way-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm used to it now. It's hard to see my feet or my hand, and sometimes I feel a little disturbed. &#8213;&#8213;Some people are happy with it, so I am even attached to it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After removing the dirty metal collar and stripping Nemu completely naked, Lilia begins to undress as well.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's sweat-soaked body emanates a fresh, warm air.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The smell of Lilia's body, which should normally be unpleasant, is mixed with sweetness and a bewitching scent that steals away a man's rationality.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is a scent that penetrates deep into the brain and shakes the very foundation of one's thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her smooth limbs exposed were too much for the eyes to take in.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The curves of her body were impossible for a man, and her flesh was soft and supple without being touched.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Blood flow gathers between Mars's legs and it begins to swell and turn upward.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, he can't thrive in a situation where Nemu is watching, so he tries to avoid looking at their bodies as much as possible, and this time he started squatting for no reason and get through this.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The bath is ready! Today's bath salts are the forest scent I bought the other day! It's called forest bathing! &#8213;&#8213;!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who was preparing the bath, emits an inarticulate voice when she sees Nemu's body in the changing room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The cause of her speechlessness was obvious, so neither Mars nor Lilia reacted to her misperception about the forest bathing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Seeing Nemu's breasts, Hazuki compared them to her own.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Even though I'm 18 years old ...... Could it be that I'll always have small breasts for the rest of my life!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Thank God you're here, Hazuki-chan, you saved me&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;?&#12288;I don't know what's going on, but I'm glad I helped!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who had her cheeks between her hands and looked disappointed and surprised at the same time, cut off his evil feelings, and Mars was relieved.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After confirming that the women have entered the bathroom, Mars also takes off his clothes and wraps a towel around his waist.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He intends to wash himself at the edge of the large bathroom.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's different from the bath Nemu knows-nya. Isn't it usually in front of the well-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;When it comes to baths, it is usually this way. It's a place not only to get clean but also to relieve fatigue. In a desert area, water is precious, so it is not surprising that Nemu, a slave, has never seen this kind of bath.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu-chan, how can your boobs get so big!? I have more toned legs and buttocks than Nemu-chan, but I have no breasts at all!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Pervert......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The bathtub, large enough for four people to lie side by side, was filled to the brim with hot water.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who loves bath salts, used the allowance given to her by Mars to buy a variety of them and added flowers to the bathtub as a finishing touch.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Incidentally, bath salts are reasonably expensive. In this world, only a few wealthy people can afford to spend money on things other than daily necessities.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although Hazuki has a very strong sexual desire, she is basically a natural girl who likes fairytale-like things and has an eye for all things cute. She is also an unparalleled bath lover.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Isn't this room warm-nya? Nemu's hair is stiff-nya&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There is hot water here. Now, let's wash your body before getting into the bathtub. You probably don't know how to wash and how to use soaps, so this time, Hazuki and I will wash you. Be honored.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu should just sit down, right-nya? Nemu is ready-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia and Hazuki start showering between Nemu, who is small and sitting in a chair.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars washes his hair and removes the sand while trying not to look at them.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;It's a heavenly hell, this place. The blood that flows in the lower half of my body, stop!</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I'm supposed to have more control over my whole body than normal, how come I can't control my lower half!?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Three beautiful girls are frolicking around in all their finery.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If he looks at them, he can see everything.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was no way that his already strong sexual desire would not be stimulated by this situation, and he was desperately thinking about the severity of the Seven Great Dungeons they were about to enter, trying to calm his alter ego that was about to burst through his towel.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But it is a man's saga to listen.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyaaaa...... it's wet nyaa... it's shivering nyaa... ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's so muddy! This is worth washing up! Your hair is so stiff, what a waste!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Just a little shower and the brownish water runoff.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu was shivering with the sensation of hot water for the first time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It tickles-nya?! Why are you touching me-nya!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Your boobs are so plump! ......! It feels different from Lilia-san's! Lilia-san's is more like ...... the feeling of being carried by the hand ......! Nemu-chan is also good!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Pervert. Live a little seriously.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I am seriously studying boobs!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;For some reason, Hazuki wants to touch Lilia, and apparently the same is true for Nemu.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Whether she is interested in something she doesn't have or simply wants to touch it is a mystery.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You have to be careful not to put water in Nemu's ears. They are different from human ears.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes, ma'am!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Seeing that the ears twitching on Nemu's head are about to get wet, Lilia gives a warning to Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Your ears, your head is cute ...... so full of fine hair, so fluffy ...... so cute!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't touch me-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Auhh! I got hit because of the fluff!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's belly is smacked by a watery tail.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki looked very happy to be smacked.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It feels so good to be warm-nya. ...... I'm going to live here-nyaa&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't live in the bathtub!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu floated in the hot water with her head on the edge of the bathtub, looking at the ceiling, her whole body relaxed, her mouth open, showing her long double teeth, and a mellow expression on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia and Hazuki line up with Nemu in the middle.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was on the edge of the tub with a towel over his eyes, listening to the conversation between the three of them and occasionally peeking through the towel.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu glanced at Mars but did not approach him or speak to him aggressively.</p>


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/4ScRNUp.jpg"></img>


<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;it's not good to be approached now.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;This is the first time I've ever felt inconvenient because my things are bigger than other people's.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The body of a seventeen-year-old with a strong sexual desire and vigor responds to the women in front of him, regardless of the owner's will.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When he finished washing his body and have nothing else to do, his mind is focused only on his worries.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia probably wanted to bathe with Mars because she wanted him to hear the information directly from her so that he would not have his own bias against Nemu's information.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia has a body so voluptuous and beautiful that it seems like a full-body sex toy, and Hazuki's lower body tickles a man's instinctive sexual desire too much.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu also has a slender and small body, but her breasts are large and the gap between them is so large that Mars thought until ...... he poured hot water on his face to cool his head. The hot water was still cooler than his head.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu was in the dungeon with those guys?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu went there-nya. Nemu likes dungeons because she's not chained up and can move around as she likes-nya. Nemu killed the biggest monster in the room-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The biggest means ...... no way. Could it be the monster on the last floor?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia knows about the Hydra, a subspecies of an extinct dragon she saw in &#12302;Sekhmet&#12303;, which she and Mars and Hazuki trudged through.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;According to Mars, the most powerful being in the dungeon is at the bottom of the dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There was a big cow-like creature-nyaa. It was a funny one, because even though it was a cow, it stood up and walked around like a human, and it had a big ax-nya. Nemu got on top of it and just kept <span style="font-style: italic;">whoosh-whoosh </span>on it, and Nemu was able to beat it-nyaa!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu smiles with a mixture of gestures.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her childlike boastful attitude is not lewd even though she is completely naked.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;<span style="font-style: italic;">Whoosh-whoosh</span> is ...... Nemu-chan, are you strong? Even though you're cute? Like magic?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;She's strong-nya! That's why Nemu is still alive-nya. If you're weak, you'll die-nya. ...... Nemu killed it &#8213; like this-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu raises her hand a little higher, and translucent claws appear, three times as long as her white, slender fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She then clicked and clacked the nails on each of her five fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was a magic that was familiar to Mars, who was watching with one of his eyes, with the towel slightly raised.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's the one you were using when you were being controlled by the slave crest earlier. Can it pierce the skin of a high-ranking monster? I might have been in a desperate situation.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Different race......It is also the kind of body expansion magic that those classified as beastmen are good at. I don't think humans use this kind of magic very often. Because it is easier to use a weapon that is suited to their physical abilities.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There are various types of magic, including those that strengthen oneself, as in the case of Mars, those that emanate outwardly as a phenomenon, as in the case of Hazuki, and those that act on the matter, as in the case of Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The magic used by Nemu is the one that expands the body itself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu legs can do it too-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ooohhh!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Perhaps amused by Hazuki's applause and admiration, Nemu shows off her claws on both arms and legs.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;After all, they fight with their physical abilities, don't they? I had heard that beastmen have superior physical abilities. We only have Mars &#8213; Master &#8213; as our vanguard, so this is going to be a good boost to our strength. After all, our next target is the Seven Great Dungeons.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu doesn't understand, but Nemu is happy to go with you to the dungeon-nya. Nemu doesn't care where, as long as she can eat food-nyaa!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's not a problem. You will eat like you have never eaten in your life. Our master is an excellent cook, and above all, he loves to serve us a feast. So&#8213;&#8213;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Why doesn't Nemu just become a slave? Even Nemu knows that much-nya. If you don't work, you won't get to eat your food-nyaa!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Unlike Lilia's preconceived notion that Nemu, who was soaking in the hot water and relaxing, had limited knowledge and weak intelligence, she seemed to have an accurate understanding of her current situation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, rather than simply understanding, it seems to come from resignation that the only way for her to live is as a slave.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't worry! Mars-san's slaves are just more like he's making it easier for him to protect them, there's nothing scary at all! He's kind and cool.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;He's cool-nya ......? You don't look too strong-nya. The strong one is cool-nya&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;It's like an invitation to a bad business.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hearing Hazuki's words, Mars recalled how he used to get entangled in the sales of such a bad business method in the past.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'd like to think I'm not weak. ...... Nice to meet you again, Nemu-chan. Just call me Mars. Let's have fun together.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After all, Hazuki has settled on Mars-san to call him, and he doesn't want to be called Master.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Besides, he's called Master by Lilia makes it sound special.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;So, I'd like to ask you about those princes you were with earlier.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Kruse-nya? He's a bad guy-nya! He gets angry easily and kicks easily-nyaa!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Right-right, that guy. Is this your first time to capture a dungeon? They said they were going to take on the Seven Great Dungeons, too.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;This is the third one, he said-nya. He wants to be king, but he doesn't have the right? He is not the best, so he goes to various dungeons looking for some treasure that was lost in a dungeon a long time ago-nyaa. The proof of a king? Nemu heard something like that-nyaa&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;Is the right of succession low?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That's why he went to the dungeon to get the achievement.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But one conquest may make you rich as an individual, but it's a long way from the national level.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the first place, the treasure is only a secondary thing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If you develop the lower levels as a resource, it can be quite a bit of money. ......</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But in the Seven Great Dungeons, there could be enough treasure to start a nation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's just called the Seven Great Dungeons because no one has ever come back alive, though it may be actually not much different from the others.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is also possible that the people who happened to challenge the dungeons were weak.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;You never know until you enter a place.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That guy has conquered the dungeons three times!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's frustrating, but his track record is exceptional&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No, that is absolutely not true! He must be using that large number of slaves as disposable!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Well, that's also the ability to capture. You don't have to be the strongest. In human society, wealth and power are also admirable qualities.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia is upset that he does not approve of Kruse's strategy, but she regains some composure when she realizes that she is just favoring Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is not good to be unable to look at things objectively, but Mars is pleased that Lilia buys him that much.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Rather than being told straight out that she likes him, it was more heartwarming to have her fondness revealed at such a casual moment.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Even like that, Kruse is the strongest warrior in the kingdom-nya. ...... Nemu thinks Kruse can usually defeat the bull that Nemu defeated-nya. He's a prince and he's strong, so no one can say anything about him-nya. The king is letting him do as he pleases-nyaa.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is that the cause of his ugly, bloated self-esteem ...... Privileged status and personal talent mesh together in the worst possible way&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In contrast to the sexy gesture of pouring hot water on her shoulders, Lilia said bitterly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There is no doubt that Kruse has the idea that everything but himself is a subordinate or property.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars felt it was understandable that he would do so if he was born blessed and given blessed abilities.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Well,...... if there are other heirs to the throne, if Kruse dies in the dungeon, he's dead, and if he lives, he'll bring in revenue. So the country would be better off if he did something a little bad and pretended it didn't happen.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;He's strong enough to be a predecessor in the dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is so in terms of strength, and supplies must be in surplus if there are any deaths.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Perhaps he can get those things like hyenas.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a scale that large, there will likely be a split in the group, and even if the prince does not want to cooperate, they may practically cooperate with each other.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Depending on the situation, I may be willing to give them everything they want except the &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book] &#8213; the magic to manipulate lifespan.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;If we can achieve our goal, we win no matter what.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I have heard that the kingdom of Laofite is a country that grew through invasion due to lack of resources, and that is why strength and achievement are the most important things, even for royalty!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I see, Hazuki-chan, you know this country. Sounds like a rogue state from what I'm hearing, doesn't it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Right-right. Most of the small tribes and cities in this area lost the war and were annexed to the Laofite kingdom. The Champion of the Desert? Or something like that. We, the Tomb Guard Village, don't belong to any of them. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The Laofite Kingdom was founded by desert nomads who defeated and integrated neighboring tribes and established themselves as a nation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although it now calls itself a kingdom, it was founded by the descendants of the most powerful of the wild thieves.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The lineage of the barbarian king seems to have been passed down from generation to generation, Mars recalled Kruse.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm starting to feel a bit dizzy. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Not something to talk about for long in the bath. Let's go somewhere for dinner when we get up.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As Mars bombards her with various questions, he realizes that he's starting to get carried away</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The only one who seems unconcerned is Hazuki, who always takes a long bath.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hazuki, please dry Nemu's hair. If it is not too much trouble, I would be happy if you trim it a little. You are surprisingly good at such detailed work, aren't you?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia, with the two playing around by her side, gets out of the bath first.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu resisted at first, but before long she and Hazuki seemed to have made their peace.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She must have understood that Hazuki is, for better or worse, a harmless type of person.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Understood! I'll make her pretty! Let's put on some nice smelling body cream!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is that why Hazuki-nyan smells so bad? Nemu can smell it no matter how far away she is!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;S-smells bad!? I'm shocked to hear that from a girl's point of view!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;While Hazuki and Nemu are fussing, Mars sneaks out of the bathroom, bending forward.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Then he bumped into Lilia, who had left the bathroom one step ahead of him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She was sitting on a chair in the changing room with a towel wrapped around her body, apparently cooling off.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her white skin, heated by the bath, had turned pink, and the towel, wet with water, was clinging to Lilia's body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her wet hair glistened as it stuck to such an enchanting body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The only thing that shone harshly and dull was the iron collar, but once you got used to seeing it, you felt that it was fashionable.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia looked at Mars, who was covering his crotch with the towel and gave him a bewitching smile.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is only a piece of cloth, but it is not enough to hide the towering body of Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The same can be said for Lilia, whose body, with its distinctly uneven surface, is more sensuously emphasized by the towel.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master. &#8213;It's getting bigger, isn't it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's a physiological phenomenon. ......It's still a pain in the eye to go in together. If I were patient enough to put up with it, I'd be living a little better. Honestly, I can't deny that I'm motivated by immediate sexual desire.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Who is it that is making it bigger?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Maybe all three of you. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I think the perfect answer there is to say me, don't you think?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her angry tone was joking, but her face was not smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia pulled her towel-covered breasts even closer together with her arms.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She then inserted her index finger into the cleavage and slowly lowered the towel to reveal an even deeper cleavage to Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The soft, soft breasts bulging out of the towel were filled with a vicious poison.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Now this is Lilia's fault.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's because Master has a strong sex drive, you see?&#12288;&#8213;It's stiff, isn't it? it's energetic today, too&#9825;&#12301;&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If he was to evaluate Lilia as a woman, she is just superb.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Not only is her body beautiful without a single blemish, but even her gestures and personality are to Mars' liking.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even the slightest gesture is ridden with a lot of fragrant sex appeal, and every fresh move is graceful.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since Mars knows the feel, temperature, and smell of her body, the temptation is much stronger than it would appear to others.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He gulps down a mouthful of saliva. He found himself gasping for air.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Before he knew it, the towel was on the floor, and his physiological erection was clearly replaced by sexual desire.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He no longer feels like he can overcome the pheromones of the female in front of him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Do you want to have sex? &#9825;&#9825;&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What, h-here ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Very much want to.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I realize that I have become a creature that moves with the lower half of my body.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;All of Lilia's secret places are hidden by a towel, but her reddened cheeks, wet gaze, and glossy lips arouse my inferiority complex.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Can you swim, Nemu-chan? I just recently discovered I can swim!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyaa!? That's amazing-nya! Nemu wonderer if she can do it too-nyaa?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You can float, so I'm sure it won't be long now!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu'll try-nyaa!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;From the bathroom, Mars hears the innocent voices of Hazuki and Nemu.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Apparently, they have no intention of getting out of the bath and still want to play.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This fact shakes Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It seems they won't be coming out for a while. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;B-but here is...&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Let's go to the living room. It's twitching and it seems painful. ......? &#9825;&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He looked down and saw clear juice coming from his stiffly erect cock.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He could tell by his senses that it was something different from the bathwater.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was hard to hold back and wait for it to subside anymore.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;His hand naturally reaches toward Lilia. He grasped her slender shoulders.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ohhhh! You're good, Nemu-chan!&#8216;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu feels like a fish-nya! This is how Nemu'll catch them-nyaa!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I guess the boobs do float, huh? Lilia-san's breast floats, and it's soft too. ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hazuki-nyan has a big butt, she can float on it! Nemu thinks it's going to explode-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ah! &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyaa!?.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Smack!&nbsp;</span>And probably through the sound of a spanking, Hazuki's muddled winning voice, and Nemu's astonishing voice, Mars grabs Lilia's shoulder and kisses her on the lips with her eyes closed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was no longer any way to restrain the elevated body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#9671;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No way, w-we're doing it on the table ......! &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Can't wait till bed ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After taking Lilia out of the bathroom, Mars immediately pushes her down on the dining table.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He then covers her up and lightly climbs onto the table, grabs one of Lilia's hands, and begins to kiss her devouringly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The lips of both Lilia and Mars have the same structure, but the softness of the lips is completely different.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Whenever he touches them, his whole body melts from the mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's roughened nose tickles him, and he thinks that he must be tickling her in the same way.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia showed no signs of resistance and was completely relaxed as if she was surrendering her body to Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Before things get going, the two of them often spend time just kissing and talking like this.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Communication through loving each other's presence is sex for them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Haah, haah,...... Master's hot and hard one is pressed against me,...... &#9825; do you want to enter my body so much,......? &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;S-sorry. I was unconscious.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Before he knew it, he was rubbing his lower abdomen against Lilia's lower body and shaking his hips.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He was surprised to find himself acting like an animal in heat.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The movement of Mars' hips had left Lilia's towel completely bare, and although her breasts were still barely covered, the lower half of her body was in full view.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Looking at her plump, peach-colored cleavage, a hot sensation rises from the back of his head.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Unable to resist any longer, he pulls off Lilia's towel as if to spread it on the dining table.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her breasts are so large that he can't tear his eyes away from them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The bewitching allure of her eyes, which made him want them so much that he couldn't stop looking at them, was similar to jewelry.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Staring in silence, Lilia cannot hide her shame and turns her face away.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;No matter how many times she has been looked at, it is embarrassing to be stared at to the point that it burns a hole in her whole body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;............&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;............&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was an awkward tension between them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Once they begin, they can lose themselves in pleasure like beasts, but just before that, there is awkward conversation and measuring of distance like boys and girls everywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After a pause, Lilia spills the beans, but there is not the slightest hint of the rut she was in just a moment ago.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I know this is not the right thing to say in this situation,......, but why don't we stop conquering the &#12302;Great Norn Tomb&#12303;......? Now I'm so eager to spend peaceful days with the Master &#8213;with Hazuki and Nemu. We don't have to take on a dangerous dungeon with a high chance of dying. ...... Master doesn't seem to be that interested in money or honor, and neither am I. It's more than enough as it is now......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I guess she was trying to say all along.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was enough momentum in Lilia's unwavering statement to make this clear.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She doesn't want to complain about Mars' actions or choices. She was unable to say so because of her usual behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars did not say that his ultimate goal was to live the same time as Lilia through lifespan manipulation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This is because he thought that a sloppy plan relying on a &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305;, which may or may not exist, might end up only hurting her by raising her expectations.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, now that Lilia has revealed her true intentions, he should not remain silent. The time to come has arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He gently touches Lilia's cheek, which looks like it is about to cry, and the warmth he feels on his fingertips helps him make up his mind.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I feel the same way. I want to continue to be with Lilia and the others. That's why&#8213;&#8213;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars told the whole story, including what he had been thinking since he first met her and heard that their lifespan was different, and how he was convinced that there was a certain number of &#12304;Forbidden Magic Books &#12305; in every dungeon because of their presence of them in both of his two dungeon captures.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He also apologized for not telling her because he didn't want to show her only hope, which he couldn't count on.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;So you are going to the dungeon is for me ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yeah. It would be too lonely for Lilia to be alone after we died, and more than anything I'd like to be with you more. That's why I challenge the dungeon and risk my life.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After living twice, he realized that he is convinced that it is empty to live only for oneself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though he trudged through dungeons alone and tried to obtain various things, he was not satisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since meeting Lilia, he had been enjoying every day. He would do anything if he could maintain those days.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Uuhh......sob......! Masteeer!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was so moved that she began to weep and sob, and eventually cried aloud.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The usually calm and collected Lilia becomes like a girl anywhere.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm so, I'm sorry, ugh, I'm so happy ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's emotions were exploding.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Before meeting Mars, Lilia had spent her entire life as a slave, moving from one slaver to another, and there was never a moment when her heart was at rest. It was filled with pain, suffering, and loneliness. It was like that for most of Lilia's life, which was longer than a human's life.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She was ridiculed and scorned, made a spectacle of, and daily reminded of her own worthlessness.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Many of the different races had their hearts broken in this way.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was even harder to keep "Lilia" because of her intelligence and pride.</p>


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zsseduk.jpg"></img>


<p class="calibre">&#12288;Every day she wished it would be easier if it would just break down.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She is loved so much that she is willing to put her life on the line.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She is cherished as an individual.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She doesn't know how to deal with the emotions that are boiling over beyond her capacity, and her blank mind is short-circuiting, and she can't stop crying and sobbing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We'll be together forever. &#8213;&#8213;I want to do my best for you.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'll go with you no matter how far, whether it's the farthest end or the bottom of the earth. ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;So this time, Mars kissed Lilia lightly with affection and wiped the tears spilling from her light ice-colored eyes with the tips of his fingers.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He feels the fire in his body cool down with Lilia's tears.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, that seemed to be the case only with Mars, and Lilia entwined her arms, then her legs, and asked Mars to kiss her again.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Haah, haaah, haah, haaah</span>, the sound of breathing too rough and a heartbeat so high that Mars could hear it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It seemed that this time Lilia was really turned on.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I want Master's baby. ......&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars' body becomes hot again as Lilia snuggles up to him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He decides to move to the sofa with Lilia in his arms. The dining table makes a creaking sound every time he moves, and her back seems to be aching.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;This is not going to stop until the end.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The hot rush that ran through his entire body was screaming for me to release his desire.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He sat deeper on the sofa, his lower body slightly thrust forward.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia, who had climbed onto his thighs in a sitting position, hugged Mars' neck.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The liquid mixture of hot water and sweat makes the surfaces of their bodies stick to each other.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The comfortable weight makes him realize that he's holding a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The softness of her breasts changes shape to match his muscular body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The soft, slightly flabby lower abdomen, characteristic of women, is pressed against his firm crotch.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is a hot, hard, veiny, and out-of-standard cock with an open caliber like an arrowhead.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even Lilia, who had always prided herself on her calmness, had been taught to feel pleasure from Mars' cock, and now she wanted to have it stirred up inside her every night.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Am I heavy ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No, not at all.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;To further increase the closeness, he pulls Lilia's hips in closer and begins kissing her with familiar movements.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As they repeated the kiss, just <span style="font-style: italic;">chu-chu, chu-chu</span>, their lips meeting, Lilia's tongue reached out and placed it on the tip of Mars' tongue.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They move into preparation for intercourse, tracing their teeth and engaging their tongues.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The tickle from the roughness of her tongue and the incomparable sweet taste makes my whole body melt.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars placed his hands on her hips, which bulge out from her slender waist, and sink his fingers into them with light pressure.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The white skin, which felt as if it was glowing faintly, was fresh and full of elasticity.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The two of them rubbed their bodies against each other in excitement, saying that words were no longer necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mmmm...... Master...... I like you, I really love you......&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia wiggles her hips back and forth, rubbing the underside of his cock against her own lower abdomen.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The feeling of his cock slipping into her lower abdomen is as flexible as slime.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The juices spilling out of the bellows become an obscene stain that sticks to Lilia's bottom.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was as if she was physically checking the length of the cock, which reached just below her navel.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's movements were not of her own volition, but rather out of arousal, and she was doing them unconsciously.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The tingle in the lower half of her body is so strong that the fact that Hazuki and Nemu are in the same space or that she needs to collect supplies for the dungeon in town seems trivial, and her rising lust easily blows away reason.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A thick liquid trickles down his cock to the base of Mars' thighs and around his testicles.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was immediately apparent that it had seeped from Lilia's secret crack.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As Lilia's face became sparer and sparer, the movement of her hips became more and more heckling and up and down as well.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The next thing he knew, Lilia's pussy was being rubbed hard against his slimy cock.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master ......! &#9825; I-I already ......&#9825; &#8213;want to have sex with you&#9825;!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The cracks stick together and Lilia's love juice is applied to the underside like a lubricant.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The airy love juice from the rubbing became sticky and cloudy white, increasing the closeness of their genitals.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The swollen clitoris slid against the cock as it railed, slurping and bouncing finely.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I want to put it in too......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The genital-to-genital contact sends waves of pleasure through his entire body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The pleasure felt when the insertion is reached is unusual. Just thinking about it makes him want to ejaculate.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia, kneeling on the sofa, holds onto Mars' shoulder with one hand, and with the other hand, she grabs his cock with her slender fingers and tries to place the tip of the glans at the vagina.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The labia are so soft and shifting in shape that they slide slippery, making it difficult to get a good aim.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When she finally manages to guide it, the size of the cock becomes an obstacle.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars nuzzled his face into the overly ample cleavage presented before him, sucked on the nipple, and eventually lifted it with both hands and squeezed it gently.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It felt like he was drowning in a pool of half-solid water.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-it's still big even after we do it hundreds of times. ......! &#9825; &#8213;&#8213;Ahhh! &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ughh!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As Mars plays with Lilia's big tits, only the tip of the glans is suddenly swallowed inside Lilia's vagina.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Whenever he put it in, it resembled the sensation of making a hole rather than putting it in a hole.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As he frowned at the pleasure of the glans being crushed, the fine folds of the vagina tangled around the glans and vibrated finely as if welcoming it, trying to suck out the semen as soon as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ahhh, haaah! ......! &#9825; &#8213;&#8213;Hmmm, hmmm! &#9825; fuhh, nnahhh... ...... &#9825; I-It won't go in! Even though I want it quickly ......&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Usually, Mars is the one who inserted it, so Lilia only has to be prepared.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This time, however, Lilia had to do it voluntarily, and she was a little intimidated by the thickness of the glans that would invade her if she relaxed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia knows better than anyone else how strong the glans are and how much pleasure they can give her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It would hook her vagina in such a way that it would pull it all the way out and torture every sexual zone inside.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Then she would be nothing more than a creature leaking out her shameful voice and asking for mating.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Just take your time.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;O, okay...... ahhh, i-it's c-come in......&#8213;&#8213;hiuuh!? &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Uughhhh ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;*schlepp*</span> When the entire glans goes in, about half of the penis is swallowed at once.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars also suddenly let out a pitiful cry as the air in his lungs was released by the stimulation given to him in one breath.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's face turns serious for a moment as it enters. A strong stimulus suddenly hit her as well.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's body falls to Mars with a jolt.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's inside is forced to take the shape of Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Aahiihh!? &#9825; Aaahhhhh, aaahh! &#9825; Mmhh, nnhhmmm!&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Impatient with the sudden insertion, Lilia tried to escape by lifting her hips, but her hips, which had lost their strength, still could not move properly, resulting in repeated weight-bearing pistons.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The pleasure she felt when trying to pull out caused her to repeatedly pull out her hips.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-It's too tight ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The tightness is so tight that it pushes it back.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The inside of her vagina twitches, and the undulating vaginal flesh twists around the cock as if it is licking and sucking it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The vagina, with its small folds up and down, left and right, is truly a masterpiece.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Each and every fold is densely packed with tiny protrusions that look like goosebumps.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There is no way that any man would not ejaculate in such a perfect vagina, which is filled to the brim with love juices.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mmm, nnffghhh.......! &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia clings to Mars with all her might and digs her nails into his back.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her fingers tremble and her breath is muffled.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia seemed to climax when the grind sensation was felt on the glans and it went all the way in.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He glimpsed Lilia's legs stretched out and she was twitching finely from the waist down.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was also stimulated so rapidly that he was about to ejaculate, and the base of his cock was twitching.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Fuahh, hhihh, nnhhhm, nnnhhhh... ......! &#9825; J-Just by being put in there, &#8213;&#8213;I came! &#9825;&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Sweat was pouring out of her body and she was out of breath, and she stiffened to prevent any more pleasure from coming over her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But this resistance was only for Lilia, and from Mars' point of view, there was no way he could hold back any longer.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;My beloved woman climaxed right in front of me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She is red from the chest up, with a few tears in her eyes, and she is breathing out hot breaths very close to Mars' face as if she is panting.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even just a pleasant vagina gives him heavenly pleasure mixed with post-climax spasms.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Stifling his excitement that he was about to ejaculate, Mars grabbed Lilia's ass and began to shake it up and down.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ahh, good, ahh, aahhh! &#9825; I'm still sensitive! &#9825; M-my breath is! &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There's no way I can endure this. ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Gorgeously tasting the vagina, which has been further warmed by the bath.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Monopolizing a woman as you shape her into your own form is a sense of conquest, not only physically but also mentally.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;D-deep! Go deeper than usual! &#9825; F-forgive me, I'm gonna! &#9825;&#9825; &#8213; c-cumming now! &#9825;&#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Due to the vertical weight of the body, even a slight rocking caused penetration deep into the depths.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He would frantically rub his cock against the finely mashed folds.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;His testicles lifted and semen rose to the tip of the urethra.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is a sweet temptation to ejaculate vaginally, which can only be described as a male instinct.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He has not the slightest desire to let it out.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;His head was affected by a slight fever.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm cumming again! &#9825; Even though, I'm already cumming!&#9825; M-my pussy trembling~!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He yields and raises and lowers Lilia and thrusts her hips up and down.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The couch made a creaking sound as if to bustle that what they were doing was embarrassing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm coming out now too......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ahh, ahhnn! &#9825; P-Please, let it out! &#9825; In my pussy with full of Master semen.....! &#9825;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ughh&#8252;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Byururuu! Byururu!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The base of the cock bounces loudly, and a hot gush of cum runs down the urethra.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars' mind went blank with the pleasure of releasing semen.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The spasms of her vagina moved inward, sucking away the remaining semen.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They held each other and basked in the afterglow of their climax.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars is out of action until he has released the rest of his semen.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Then they gasped and breathed and looked at each other in silence.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After this, Mars kisses her again and starts rubbing the thing that is still swollen in her vagina and the second round will begin.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They had no idea what was going on around them, and of course, they intended to do so, but&#8213;&#8213;.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu-chan! You have to wipe up properly and get dressed before you leave!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If you leave it alone, it will dry up-nyaa!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu comes running toward the living room, completely naked. Then Hazuki, who is holding a towel to the front of her body, comes after her to stop her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Seeing Mars and Lilia, who was completely naked and laying on top of each other, Nemu pointed at them and looked back at Hazuki, saying,</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;These two aren't wearing clothes either, and they aren't wiping themselves off-nya! It's soaking wet! And it smells funny!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;W-What are you two doing!? And you're all drenched!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia-nyan's crying-nya!? Nemu knew it Mars-nyan is going to hit her too-nyaa!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If you're going to have sex, please have sex with me too!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The air of calmness vanished in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars and Lilia looked at each other, rubbed their foreheads lightly, and laughed.</p>
<div class="start-9em">
<p class="calibre">&#9671;</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Everyone gets ready.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars and Lilia bathed again before that.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although not yet slaves, Lilia insisted that Nemu should also be collared so that the outside eye could see the owner.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is a fake just in case because you never know what a different race without an owner will do to you.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;This dress is too tight at the chest-nya. ......Nemu's going to wear her old clothes after all-nya&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-it's tight......m-my clothes are ......!? &#8213;&#8213;That makes it look like I don't have boobs!&#12288;Besides, your old clothes are falling apart, so no!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There was none at all-nya? Hazuki-nyan is more child than Nemu-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Even though I'm like this I'm an older sister! I have boobs, t-too, y-you know! It's plump and when you touch it, it's soft! Look, look!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After getting out of the bath, Nemu put on Hazuki's clothes and complained, wagging her tail from side to side.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The clothes were custom-made in Hazuki's size, so Nemu's breasts were too tight.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was a sad reality that Hazuki was the oldest except for Lilia. Mars knew this when it was decided to dress Nemu in Hazuki's clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu was dressed in shorts suspended from her shoulders by a string, and on top was a short shirt that showed her stomach.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her new collar as a slave was blue, and an equally blue ribbon was attached to the end of her tail by Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her hair is bluish silver, so the colors are said to be blue, gold, and white.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's a style that combines cuteness and cheerfulness.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki wears this dress to show more of her abdomen and look lascivious. In the end, she was too embarrassed to wear it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The bottom of this dress is also tight because Nemu had to wear something under it-nya!&#12288;Also Nemu's body stinks-nya! It's because you put something slimy on Nemu-nyaa!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You have to wear panties! I-I I told you, t-that slime things is a fashion item! Doesn't it smell good!? It was expensive you know!? I'm shocked that you said it smelled bad!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I don't know if they're close or not. ...... They're like sisters.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It doesn't seem like it would be hard for Nemu to fit in.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Beside, you've become so beautiful, Nemu-chan I mean, you are a beautiful girl, to begin with, Nemu-chan! You have long eyelashes, round eyes, pink lips, and silky hair. ......! There's certainly something different about this ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyaaa~ ...... don't stare at Nemu too much-nyaa!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You're so shy! So cute!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;S-Shut up-nyaa!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki teases Nemu, who looks a little red with embarrassment.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu's hair had been trimmed by Hazuki, and compared to when they first met, there was a world of difference in her appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars and Lilia both have their hair cut by Hazuki. Although she was a rough cook, Hazuki had a talent for such detailed work.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu seemed to be concerned about her neck area, probably because of the discomfort caused by the change in the collar that had probably been used for many years.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Pervert woman is shy, but she shows her sociability in strange ways. In the store, she turns red in the face and can't even order her own food. One thing that Master and Nemu have in common is that ...... you two youngers than that pervert woman?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is she the type of guy who can be aggressive with younger people........That doesn't sound good, does it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Or is it motherly? I thought a strong sex drive means a high desire to reproduce and the motherhood that comes with it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then is Lilia also motherly?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;W-What do you mean by that!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Seeing that Nemu's tension had eased, Mars took Lilia, who was blushing and pouting and went to the living room, where they all sat down at the table.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu-chan, first of all, is it true what you said earlier about being a slave?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu will if you give her a food-nya. Nemu will do more if she can get into place at the hot water place she just had.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Baths are no good(?). ...... If you don't feel comfortable, I'll give you money and you can choose to go straight to freedom. Nemu-chan, you have no reason to risk your life.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He would be happy to have her join Mars and others, but if she is not willing to cooperate voluntarily, it is also unnecessary.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Uncooperative companions are much more troublesome than enemies.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What is freedom-nya ......? Nemu is fine with being a slave-nyaa. Nemu doesn't understand the numbers even if she gets paid, and Nemu has been a slave from the beginning, so she doesn't have to think about it-nya. Nemu is a hated person and has nowhere to go and nothing to do-nya. All the humans are angry at Nemu for being a "Monster" when she approaches them. ...... And this is the first time Nemu had so many things-nya. If you want to stay with Nemu, Nemu might want to stay with you-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I welcome that choice, of course.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Flopping down on her ears, Nemu spoke sadly, as if remembering something.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia had once told Mars that a slave of a different race could easily lose their life just by being a slave of a different race.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In fact, Nemu had been almost killed in front of Mars and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We are going to the Seven Great Dungeons. Will you still follow me? &#8213;&#8213;You could die, you know.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu'll go-nya. Because she was originally brought in to go there-nya. Nemu is small but strong-nyaa! Gah! <span style="font-style: italic;">whoosh-whoosh</span>! If Nemu does that, she can defeat most of the monsters-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu puts her hands to the sides of her face and smiles while striking a menacing clawed pose.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I wonder if different races are stronger than humans on average?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Lilia also has great skills in magic and archery.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I don't know what Nemu-chan is talking about, it's a bit too abstract. ......</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I can imagine that they are strong and are probably alienated by humans.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;And because there are so few of them, it's even more so.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If Nemu becomes Mars-nya's slave, will she be able to eat all the food she wants?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Of course. My hobby is cooking, you see? I also like to buy clothes for Lilia and Hazuki-chan. Let's buy a lot of clothes for Nemu-chan, too.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At Mars' words, Nemu's golden eyes shone even brighter, and she opened her mouth wide to smile, showing off her long double teeth.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then, Nemu'll become your slave-nyaa! Nemu Nail, looking forward to working together-nya! Ah, but Nemu likes this lightweight collar-nya. The last one was so heavy that her head was wobbling when she walked-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Well, if she's my slave, I'm fine with it, but it's pretty easy for everyone else to decide.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Both Hazuki and Nemu are short-sighted in their thinking since they so easily agree to be slaves.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Of course, the fact that Mars has no harmful intentions is one of the factors, but the way they make their choice is intuitive, even though it is like entering an unchangeable job.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This was somewhat disconcerting to Mars, who was Japanese, but not so unusual by the standards of this world.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After all, this world is full of danger and death is very close at hand. The premise is too different from the present.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;On average, the life expectancy of the common people, except for the nobility and other privileged classes, is around 50 years old at best.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A person's life can be bought with money, and starvation is a real cause of death for the common people. Orphans are common in some places.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Therefore, the short-sighted way of thinking, to live happily for the day, is rather a rationale for the general population of this world. First of all, there are not many people who have regular jobs, and many of them spend all the money they earn from their day jobs within the day.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The thought that tomorrow may not come, or worse, is the premise of many people's actions, which is why not a few people go to dungeons where they can get rich. Otherwise, people would not risk their lives to challenge dungeons.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Boring and peaceful daily life is a luxury that only a limited number of privileged people can afford in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As Nemu smiles, Lilia looks at Mars and giggles.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was the kind of look that seems to see right through his heart.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Somehow ...... It's starting to look a little more like a family.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Indeed&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia-san is the mother? I'd prefer to be the wife if possible, but ...... Lilia is my mother-in-law!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I am the wife, got it? I'm pretty sure that's the order in which we met, right? I'll fight you if you want!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia narrowed her eyes and quietly intimidated Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars, who thinks of both of them as his wives, remains silent for the time being so as not to provoke Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Family ...... You mean like a big horse and a little horse-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's right. Do you have a family, Nemu-chan?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu lived with horses in a stable, so she guess horses are her family-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Where's your mother and father?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He thought it was an insensitive question, but he had to ask.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Because if she does have a family, he doesn't think she can be a slave.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If that is the case, Mars wanted to send her home to her family.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu doesn't have them-nya. Nemu probably ...... &nbsp;grew out of the earth-nya. That's why she looks different from everyone else-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu says with a mixture of gestures.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She didn't seem to be joking and somehow sounded as if she was being somewhat serious.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Biologically, such a thing is impossible. I'm sure your parents are out there somewhere. One of them is probably human. Nemu's physical characteristics are not purely heterogeneous - because you are not a beast. Your body hair is human-like or less, and your limbs are very different from those of a beastman.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In Lilia's view, Nemu was at least half-human, and in some cases had been interbred with humans for several generations.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The original beastmen, both male and female, are physically much larger than humans, are covered with strong body hair that resembles armor, and have claws on their hands and feet that can tear apart an armored human.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu looks like a human with cat ears and a tail, and her fur is a light blue almost white color that would stand out in the wild.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyaa!? Nemu is also a human-nya!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Y-yes, you are like a human being. I don't know, I haven't looked into it in detail. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;That Lilia has given up on explaining!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia, who has a strong appetite for knowledge perhaps because she has lived a long life, is very fond of explaining things, but when it comes to Nemu, she easily gives up.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This is probably because there is too much of a difference in their assumed knowledge.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia finds it difficult to make Nemu understand because explanation after explanation becomes necessary.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But Nemu is not really interested in family-nyaa. Nemu doesn't really understand-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Well, let's just say we are family for a while. Let's all go looking for your family someday. That kind of journey would be nice.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They can do so once they have conquered the dungeon and are no longer bound by time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even considering the possibility of failure, Mars was basically working on the assumption that his wishes would be fulfilled.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;A &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305; that would extend life span.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It may seem absurd, but in fact, Mars has been reincarnated in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Clearly, this is a phenomenon that transcends the laws of physics and the like.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even magic exists. There are even elves whose lifespan is nearly ten times longer than humans by default.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If that is the case, it is hard to believe that it is not possible to extend his lifespan.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hazuki-chan's hometown is an unprecedented dungeon. Let's do our best to breakthrough.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu doesn't know about you, but it's easy with Nemu-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With one arm outstretched wide, Nemu raised her voice while moving her ears.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Then Hazuki reached out her arm from the other side of the room and gently stroked Nemu's head.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Good, good, Nemu-chan is strong, isn't she?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't touch Nemu's head-nya! Hazuki-nyan, you touch Nemu so easily, she doesn't like it-nya! Nemu is different from cat-nya! They sleep all the time-nya! But Nemu works-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu reacted unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Apparently, she did not like to be treated like a cat.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Still, her big cat ears and tail are completely that of a cat.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Per &#8213; Hazuki. Different races, especially those called beastmen, differ from humans in their perceptual and other abilities. Do not touch-sensitive sense organs such as ears too much. You wouldn't like it if someone suddenly touched your sensitive parts, would you?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia also touched her own long ear.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her hearing is much better than that of a human, but it is more sensitive.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What, I-I'm excited, but.. ......? When Mars-san touches my butt, I'm already ...... thrilled and soaked? Ahhhh, I have to copulate and get pregnant, and so will Lilia-san, right!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Pervert! I'm not that slutty! W-well? I have a little bit of a lust ......&#8213;Ah, no, Master, it's not that, it's more like a sales pitch with ...... Hazuki, and I'm not sure I'd like that. I mean it! I-I'm going to go into heat properly, all right!? When you whisper to me from behind and breathe in my ear, my whole body relaxes, my genitals are on fire, and I feel slimy......... Oh, Geez! How can I say that! Hazuki, it's your fault!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia, who had only been embarrassed at first, realized that denying everything Hazuki said was as good as saying she did not lust in Mars, so she stood up with her hands on the desk and hurriedly corrected him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But perhaps because she was too upset at the thought that she must have caused displeasure, she unintentionally uttered even embarrassing things.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Finally, she squats down and silently hides her face with her hands.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is as if he could hear her saying that if there was a hole in her heart, she would like to get in it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was too embarrassing a situation for the proud Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But even though she hid her face, her long ears were stained red, which both Mars and Hazuki could see.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Does Hazuki-nyan want her butt touched-nya? It was fun to hear the great voice-nya. What is <span style="font-style: italic;">koebi</span>? Does Lilia-nyan have a stomachache-nya? Does Nemu can pat her belly-nya?&#12301; <span style="font-style: italic;">[TLN: Koebi=Mating]</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu was worried about Lilia, who was crouching down, uttering pure questions.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;N-Nemu, don't ask. There is not the slightest need to memorize what the woman there says and does. And there is nothing wrong with me.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Th-that's awful!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars laughed at the exchange, which may or may not has been friendly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's another peaceful day, even though they may die soon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He hopes these peaceful days will last forever.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#9671; &#9671;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;When did it become like this?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Could I have stopped this before it happened?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;No, I am sure nothing can be changed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;All I can do is keep my promise of long ago and stay by his side.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#12302;Stay by my side forever. In this cold and crowded palace, you are my only ally.&#12303;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Julis Howe, a twenty-three-year-old female knight in Prince Kruse's entourage, watches the events unfold at Kruse's side, remembering words from long ago.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;On the night of the encounter with Mars and the others, that is, on the same day that they had broken through the dungeon, Kruse and his party were moving forward in a wagon train to their next destination, the &#12302;Great Norn Tomb&#12303;.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The slaves, numbering about 1,000, were not given a good rest even after being overworked in the dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A being named Mars is also aiming for the Seven Great Dungeons.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This information further ignited Kruse's sense of merit.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The ability and power to do anything, and the blood of the champion who controls a vast territory burned in his veins do not allow Kruse to stop his progress.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Who do you think it is thanks to whom that you scum can live!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Prince Kruse swung his whip at the four slave leaders who commanded the slaves.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The heads of slaves were originally knights in the royal service, who were deprived of their status due to failure in their work and fell into slavery.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, there is a considerable difference in their abilities from those who were born into the slave class.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since many of them had command experience, they were given a certain amount of command authority as platoon leaders in these cases.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I am giving garbage like you a comfortable life! You don't have to say it, but you know what I mean!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A large man, a man of superior muscle strength and physique, would not hesitate to crack a whip in earnest, which would naturally result in ripped flesh and profuse bleeding.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The cause of Kruse's fury is Mars' intervention.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If the slave leaders had been more firm, the irregularity of being intervened by Mars would not have occurred, Kruse was indignant.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Of course, this was only a false accusation, and the slave masters were also privately angry at Kruse's unreasonable response.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And it was the same for his close aide, Julis. Although he is an ally, she does not agree with all of Kruse's behavior.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;On the contrary, she is the one who is more concerned about Kruse's current behavior than anyone else.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Because she knows the time when it was not so.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If she evaluates the present Kruse without favoritism, it is appropriate to say that he is a muscular and calm man in a bad sense.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The calmness in a bad sense is an evaluation derived from the ruthlessness of his character.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But that is also why he is strong. Because he can kill others without hesitation, which most people cannot do easily.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He has always been calm, but not as calm as he is now. Only Julis knows that.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Even though I'm letting you accompany me beside the honor, ...... And I'm even entrusting you guys with platoon command, right?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He whips his blue-striped face a few times again.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As one might expect, when it comes to a thousand-man force, Kruse alone can't assume command of all of them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Therefore, some of the slave operations are entrusted to close associates such as the slave leader and Julis.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since Kruse directly manages the slave prints of these slave leaders, they will not rebel even if he inflicts this kind of corporal punishment on them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Only one person in Kruse's group is not a slave, Julis.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Are you looking down and making a disgruntled face? But I am more displeased. I had to make such an abomination in front of a trashy crowd that exists only to make my supremacy known.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a thud, Kruse sat down on the throne set up in the carriage and put his hand on his cheeks.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;All people other than himself-including his father, the king, and his brother, the princes-are equally worthless trash. His sense of value is so extremely distorted that he thinks so. All beings other than himself are tools and enemies.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The slaves only suppress their voices and look down, and do not reply to Kruse even a single word.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Their expressions, which cannot be seen by Julis or Kruse, are clouded with vindictiveness.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They are only obeying because of the existence of the slave crest and because the families they left behind in the country are being held, as a hostage.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was no way for a relationship of trust to exist between Kruse and slaves in such a position.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They are silent, not because they agree, but because they know that silence is the quickest way to settle their anger. This kind of corporal punishment was a daily occurrence.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's enough. &#8213;&#8213;I'm tired of it. Get lost.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With the magic that solidifies the air and sends it flying, Kruse forcefully opens the carriage doors while seated.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The cold air of the desert at night swept into the carriage at once.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Kruse turns his palm toward one of the slave leaders.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Julis, sensing what he is about to do, kneels on the floor and bows his head to beg.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Kruse-sama. They are commanders who have slave crests for several people even though they are slaves. They are well-liked by the slaves, and their individual abilities are also high, so it is regrettable to lose them. So, please refrain from further reprimands. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Kruse was going to knock the four slave leaders off the running carriage.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Julis, who is always with him, could anticipate Kruse's thoughts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though it was sand below, there were dozens of carriages following behind them, so it was extremely dangerous.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If they were dropped while injured, the sand could get into their wounds and make them seriously ill.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After looking lost for a moment, Kruse, realizing that he seemed to be a bit preoccupied, stood up from his throne and showed his back to the slave leaders.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The man named Kruse is ruthless, but he is not stupid.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He is a man with a rational thought base, even though he has a strong predilection for cruelty, and he knows that using slaves to attack dungeons is a way to maximize his power and financial resources.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Be thankful for my generosity. I will return to my sleeping quarters.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ha ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You, too, come back later.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Understood&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After spitting out a bummer, Kruse slipped through the wall of the carriage and leaped to a special sleeper carriage running behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Due to the magic of the &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305; he obtained in the dungeon he had trudged through, Kruse has acquired a variety of magic skills.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The one he used was one of them, a magic that allows him to slip through walls.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is a powerful magic that allows him to attack monsters from inside the walls in dungeon attacks, or even avoid encountering monsters in the first place.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, it cannot be used all the time because it rapidly depletes one's strength while inside the walls, but in a dungeon attack, it was magic that could be called a cheat without limit.</p>

<div class="main1">

<p class="calibre">&#12300;Those who are injured, come this way. I will heal them to the best of my ability.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-if you do that, Julis-sama, Kruse-sama will ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Julis lightly bows her head to the slave leaders and applies healing magic to the whip wounds.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Julis has a certain respect for those who are older than she is and who were once her colleagues and superiors. Therefore, even though they have been reduced to a slave, she does not treat them with disdain, although she does show a hierarchical relationship with them. She also thought that tomorrow would be her own day.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I don't mind. I am used to being reprimanded, and with me, it is not so harsh. &#8213;&#8213;I hope you don't begrudge Kruse-sama too much.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;B-but ...... Isn't it too arrogant? I think this is far outside the bounds of what is allowed just because he is royalty.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Julis does not blame the slave leaders for their verbal complaints.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although Julis is number two in the group, she is often consulted about these kinds of complaints.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And she doesn't tell anyone about it. That is why she has won the trust of the slaves, and she adjusts the relationship between superiors and subordinates as if she were a middle manager.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This is Julis's own way of giving and take</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As long as she is a loyal subordinate of Kruse, even if the slaves are dissatisfied with Kruse himself, if they listen to what Julis says, it is practically the same as listening to Kruse's orders.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That person is not doing it because he likes it either. He's just frustrated like that as a result of recognizing that this is the most important time in his life.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;............&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That cruelty will also serve as a hobby.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That was the implication in the way the slave leaders looked at Julis.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;He is not really that kind of person, </span>Julis was about to say, then quickly closed her mouth and said something else to the slave leaders.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;<span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;At least he used to be different. He was kinder and more innocent</span> .......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The &#12302;Scepter of Dominion&#12303;, which is said to have belonged to the founding king, is lost in a dungeon somewhere. With it, Kruse-sama's succession to the throne will be realized. In addition, the Kingdom of Laofite will enjoy a thousand years of prosperity with the unprecedented achievement of having conquered the Seven Great Dungeons.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The origin of this treasure, the &#12302;Scepter of Dominion&#12303;, is said to have originally come from a dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is an item that can invoke a mental domination spell that causes favors the owner.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was one of the greatest treasures of the kingdom of Laofite.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The founding king is said to have used his overwhelming power and the magical items it contained to create the foundation of the country as it is today.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He is a man of unknown origin except for being a nomad, and it is rumored that he may have been a dungeon treader.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, it was lost when the king several generations ago embarked on a dungeon expedition in search of rich resources.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since none of them ever returned, it is not even known in which dungeon it was lost.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At that time, dungeons were unknown and unexplored, and there were no such divisions as the Seven Great Dungeons, as there are now, so the only information known is that it was lost in a dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The purpose of Kruse is to recover the treasure and the treasures of the Seven Great Dungeons.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I say this knowing that Julis-sama is Kruse-sama's confidant, ......&#8213;&#8213;I don't think that man is fit to be king. If only he had half the grace of the black-haired adventurer we met the other day... He should have been the crown prince a long time ago.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;...... We will proceed to obtain that vessel. Besides, I don't think that black-haired adventurer is capable of trudging through the dungeon. He needs above all to have the calmness to cut down on others depending on the situation. Kruse-sama has it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;The man was strong. But that's all.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Being kind is not always the right thing to do. If being nice was enough to get what you wanted, Kruse-sama would have stayed the same.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Remembering Mars, Julis bit her back teeth.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the country, the king's symbolic presence is the &#12302;Scepter of Dominion&#12303;, and the father of the current king Kruse has a replica of the scepter in shape only, based on the remaining data.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If he could acquire the real one, he would be the rightful heir to the throne and could even become king without the magical power of the scepter.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He was truly the vessel of a king.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You guys go back to your posts now. And Kruse-sama is going to bed. So tell the slaves that they are allowed to have a drink during their break, as long as it is moderate. Quietly, of course.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;B-but then, what if he finds out later!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Rest assured. The liquor and food that the Seventh Unit is carrying were bought by me at my own expense. Even Kruse-sama cannot complain. &#8213;&#8213;I know it will be hard going from dungeon to dungeon without a pause, but please keep your spirits up as much as possible.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I understand ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although she has not been ordered to ventilate her subordinates, if she is disliked by Kruse, it will lead directly to the danger to Kruse's life.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That's why she was covering for him at her own expense.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm going to take a rest now. I'm sure that Kruse-sama will be in a better mood by tomorrow.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Among the group, Julis's voice is second only to Kruse's.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She has accompanied them on three dungeon attacks so far, and she is the most trusted advisor to them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Using her authority, she stops the carriage in which the throne is located, disembarks the slave leaders, and looks at the empty throne.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is a golden throne with elaborate decorations.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What Kruse wants is not an empty throne like this.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The secret base they had built together in a corner of the palace, a chair handmade from a tree branch, seemed more glorious. The figure has become more splendid, but everything about the present seems to fade to Julis.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;How did it all come to this? All I want is "those days".&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Muttering a few words, Julis recalls their golden age, which will never return.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hope is in the past. We walk from the past to reclaim the future we want.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Julis did not know whether she was moving forward or standing still.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Either way, I just have to keep the promise I made back then. To be by his side. That is the meaning of my existence. My life has belonged to him since the day he picked me up.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The love of her childhood brought Julis to the dungeon, the highest and most extreme place that mankind can challenge.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She came prepared to devote herself and her heart to it if that is what her beloved wanted.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if the person he loved has changed into a different person, what he had gained and what he had lost to get to this point are intertwined with each other and cannot be escaped.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Julis thinks that becoming an adult is synonymous with being bound by status and responsibility and losing one's freedom.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;We cannot remain just as pure as we used to be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I will make that man king. To give him a peace that is not threatened by anything.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Julis is only a knight, and she knows that there is no way that she can be united with Kruse, who has become king.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even so, she wants to go beyond being a squire and support the dream of the man she loves like a woman.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Even if I can't reach the future I want if that man is happy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Julis is aware that the promise has long since become a curse.</p>
