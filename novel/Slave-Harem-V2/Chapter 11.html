<h3>Chapter 11</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyahaha! There's something weird in there-nya! But it's kinda cute-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After leaving the campsite of Kruse and his groups, they walk for a while and come to a large passageway.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is more than 20 meters wide and high, shaped like a <span style="font-style: italic;">tsuchinoko</span> with a bulging belly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Beyond it, the original relatively narrow and low path continued.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu runs in the direction of a kitten-like voice saying, <span style="font-style: italic;">"Mii-mii!"</span><br /></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was a hollow-like hole, slightly off the large passage.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Something small, even from Nemu's small stature, seemed to be hovering around her feet.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu crouched down and touched it without alarm.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's smooth and fluffy-nya. You're round, aren't you-nyaa?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Did something attached to you again? I know in the city of Oasis, you were surrounded by cats and dogs.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu doesn't like them, but the animals seem to like Nemu-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You don't like animals!? Even though you're surrounded by them all the time!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;They smell a little-nya&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As is characteristic of beastmen, Nemu is unusually easily favored by animals.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Monsters are different in nature, but small animal-like monsters have often approached Nemu defenselessly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He assumed that this would be the case this time, so he only gave her a light warning.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason for this is that Nemu is a strong fighter herself, so there is little need to worry about her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, the fact that Nemu is not an animal lover came as a shock to Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It was an unexpected coming out. ......Nemu-chan, be careful. Even if it is cute, you never know what it might do to you.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I'm a little curious too! Is it a cat? <span style="font-style: italic;">Mii-mii</span>, it sound so cute!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;How could they be in a dungeon? It's a juvenile monster of some kind, I'm sure.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But sometimes there are very cute monsters, too. Cute ones that look like they're being kept as pets.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Indeed. A rabbit-like thing with horns ...... Al-Mi'raj? I've always wanted to have one of those. My neighbor's house has one, ...... it's cute, that thing.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;......Would rabbit ears look good on me?&#12288;If Master likes it, I'm willing to wear it all the time!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If Lilia put on rabbit ears, her ears would be cramped!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The category of monsters has its fair share of less dangerous ones.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Such monsters were kept as pets or domesticated and blended into human society.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu did not strongly discourage the monsters she found, thinking that they might be similar to the ones she had found.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Every dungeon has its out-of-place weaklings. He feels that they exist as food for other monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We'd better get going, Nemu-chan.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Even if they are small, they are still monsters, so don't let Nemu or the pervert woman get too close to them. Ignore them and move on.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They do not deal with less dangerous monsters.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The group's opinion is that they don't want to kill too many of them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Naturally, they will kill dangerous monsters, but not unnecessarily.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They do this even in ordinary dungeons, but in the &#12302;Great Norn Tomb&#12303;, where even if they defeat them, they will come back to life, they have no reason to deal with them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Besides, since ordinary monsters have a hostile relationship with the undead, it is more advantageous to keep them alive.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyahaha! You have so many heads-nyaa!? Who's the greatest-nya!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;So many heads......? I-I have a bad feeling about this, though!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Everyone quietly peeked from behind Nemu at what Nemu was stroking.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was the size of a basketball.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What was there was&#8213;&#8213;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It was Hydra!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;They're in this dungeon too! I thought they were extinct!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hydra, an extinct species of monster they encountered in the dungeon &#12302;Sekhmet&#12303;, was there.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was a squat, ball-like sphere with arms and legs and nine small snakes attached to it like a head.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia said it was a subspecies of dragons.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is a monster that breathes poison and will continue to regenerate unless the core in its center is crushed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The size of the adult would be as huge as two 16-ton trucks stacked on top of each other.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But no matter how many times you see it, Mars thinks it is an unbalanced creature. It looks like a bun with a snake growing out of it walking around.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;It might be a little cute when you look at it like this. But are the snakes were creatures that make a squeaking sound?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The kitten-like <span style="font-style: italic;">Mii-mii</span>&nbsp;and roundish form of the figure do not look any cuter than one would expect.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was lunging more and more toward Nemu's shins as if it was nipping at them, but they were softer than they looked, or perhaps they were repulsed by the munching.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I forgot! That thing is poisonous! Get away from that, Nemu-chan!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyaa? Are you poisonous-nya? Nemu doesn't smell anything like that-nyaa&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It is not poisonous when it is a child. ......? W-with that said, get away from that!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, um, ...... there are a lot of those babies over here. ......!? And lots of eggshells too......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Young hydras come crawling in from all over the place.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They had no hostile intent and seemed to be approaching purely out of curiosity.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Their kitten-like <span style="font-style: italic;">Mii-mii</span> increased and began to spread over a fairly wide area.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They repeatedly rush to rub their bodies against the feet of Mars and the others, as if they are curious about humans or want to be cared for.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The den ......! Um, if there are children, then, of course, their parents are there too ......!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I was trying not to tell you!&#12301;(?)</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia's white skin pales even more, and as she says this, the ground shakes with a wobble.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The ground shook as if something heavy was approaching.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Something big is coming-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I know!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu seemed to have detected it with sonar, but the vibration told everyone that it was close enough to know without using it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And since the children were squealing, the parents would be angry because they thought they had done something to their children.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Let's run! If it breathes poison in a place like this, we could die!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even in a wide passageway, if a huge monster breathes out with its nine necks, it will not be far away from filling the air.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The only way to defeat it is to smash it to pieces, but he doesn't want to get into a battle if he can help it because its blood also contains poison.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The four of them, not expecting to run into such a big monster in the passageway, ran as fast as they could, with Mars in last place.</p>
