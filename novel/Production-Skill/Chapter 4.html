<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; I Took The Registration Test At The Adventurer&#8217;s Guild</h3>


<p>I had just finished trying on the armor and returned to my suit when there was a knock at the door. I answered the door and found the old man&#8217;s butler standing there.</p>
<p>&#8220;After lunch, the Grand Master will be leaving with his carriage. If it&#8217;s alright with you, Kou-sama, we can drop you off in front of the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild.&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, there was no reason to refuse. I had just arrived in this city and had no idea where anything was.</p>

<p>After an early lunch, I got into the large carriage with Chrome-san.</p>
<p>As the carriage left the mansion, we soon approached the center of the city.</p>
<p>It was still just after ten o&#8217;clock in the morning, but the stores along the street were all packed with people. There were street vendors everywhere, shouting cheerfully.</p>
<p>In the plaza-like area, street performers were putting on a show, and the crowd was applauding.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s quite a lively place.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a festival going on today?&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked, and Chrome-san shook his head.</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s always like this in Aunen. It&#8217;s the biggest city in the area. There are rumors that so many people are moving here that they can&#8217;t expand the city in time.&#8221;</p>
<p>The city was surrounded by thick walls, so I wondered if this meant that they would have to expand the walls. It seemed like a lot of work.</p>
<p>The Adventurer&#8217;s Guild was located in the center of the city, near the large fountain square. The building was made of brick and looked very sturdy.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, Chrome-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the least I can do. &#8230;Oh, yes. Please take this.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I was exiting the carriage, Chrome-san handed me a small leather bag.</p>
<p>The bag was heavy despite its size. There was a clinking sound inside.</p>
<p>&#8220;Chrome-san, this is&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yesterday, Kou-sama carried the wagon&#8217;s luggage with your <b>[Item Box]</b>, right? This is the reward for that. Please use it as a deposit to start your adventure.&#8221;</p>
<p>I opened the leather bag and found it filled with gold coins.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite a lot of money, isn&#8217;t it? Are you sure?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course I am. You&#8217;ve done a lot of work, so you should receive a fair reward. &#8230;Well, to be honest, it would be great if you could become a patron of my trading company. I&#8217;m sure Kou-sama will eventually become a high-ranking adventurer, so this is an investment with an anticipation toward that time. Hahaha.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chrome-san laughed jokingly. He was probably trying to make it easier for me to receive the gold.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. I&#8217;ll try to give as much of this money as I can back to the Scarlet Trading Company.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, by all means, please be our patron. Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me. If you have any problems, you can always come to the mansion.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much. Chrome-san, you can always call on me if you need my help.&#8221;</p>
<p>We shook hands as we said goodbye, and I got out of the carriage.</p>
<p>After seeing Chrome-san&#8217;s carriage off, I walked to the edge of the sidewalk and looked into the leather bag. There are a lot of gold coins inside, but how much are they really worth?</p>
<p>I activated the <b>[Appraisal]</b> function and immediately found the answer.</p>
<p>The total amount was 80,000 Komsa.</p>
<p>Komsa is a universal currency unit, and it seems that the value is about one Komsa = one yen. In other words, I was handed 80,000 yen out of the blue.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know whether to be grateful or sorry, but&#8230; I&#8217;ll try to use the Scarlet Trading Company as much as possible for shopping to repay the favor.</p>
<p>Now that the money issue is over&#8230; let&#8217;s go to the adventurer&#8217;s guild.</p>
<p>I opened the <b>[Item Box]</b> and put on the Armored Bear Armor. I also kept the stuffed head on my left shoulder. It looked incredibly intimidating.</p>
<p>When I touched it, its fur was surprisingly fluffy.</p>
<p>I opened the door to the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild and walked in to find a large crowd of adventurers gathered in the lobby.</p>
<p>Some of them had unusually long ears, beast ears, or tails. Apparently, there are elves and beastman in this world.</p>
<p>When I see this kind of thing, I feel like I&#8217;m really in a fantasy world, and I get excited.</p>
<p>There was a counter in the back, so I decided to head there.</p>
<p>&#8230;Hmm?</p>
<p>I suddenly noticed something strange.</p>
<p>The adventurers, who until a moment ago had been going about their business as they pleased, now kept their mouths shut and glanced at me.</p>
<p>Their appearance was like that of herbivores trying to get past predators.</p>
<p>I was wearing Armored Bear Armor to prevent them from taking me lightly, but I didn&#8217;t expect to frighten them.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, that&#8217;s an Armored Bear armor, isn&#8217;t it&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that the &#8216;Bear Killer&#8217; they&#8217;re talking about? You know, the one that beat up that shitty mercenary at the city gate&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I know that story. He showed the mercenaries the lifeless head of the bear and threatened them, saying, &#8216;This will be you in three seconds,&#8217; right?&#8221;</p>
<p>Thanks to the<b>《Hearing Enhancement A》</b>granted to my armor, I can hear the whispering.</p>
<p>I heard that yesterday&#8217;s incident has already become a rumor among adventurers, but what is a &#8216;Bear Killer&#8217;?</p>
<p>Please don&#8217;t give me a strange nickname.</p>
<p>I mean, isn&#8217;t the story developing in a strange direction?</p>
<p>I indeed showed the bear&#8217;s head, but I didn&#8217;t threaten the mercenaries.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s just a rumor.</p>
<p>&#8220;What does the &#8216;Bear Killer&#8217; want with the Adventurer&#8217;s Guild? Is he trying to beat us up?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If so, we&#8217;d all be dead by now. &#8230;Is he an adventurer by any chance?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, is his rank A or S&#8230;? Ugh, I&#8217;m curious.&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sorry to disappoint you, but I&#8217;m a new adventurer. The guild had three reception areas, but the middle one was empty.</p>
<p>There was a man sitting at the counter on the left, but he said, &#8220;Oh, I have a chronic illness&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>I wondered if it wasn&#8217;t a chronic illness but cowardice.</p>
<p>All that remained was the counter on the right, where a petite girl was sitting.</p>
<p>She was probably in her late teens. Her chestnut brown fluffy hair was pulled to one side in a honey braid. Her golden eyes sparkled, giving her an impression of being lively. Her face was a little young, but she looked well put together, and she had an amiable smile on her face.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome to the Aunen Branch of the Adventurers&#8217; Guild! Onii-san, you&#8217;re looking fabulous!&#8221;</p>
<p>Apparently, this receptionist is quite a big deal.</p>
<p>I wish someone who ran away from me because of a chronic illness or cowardice would learn from her.</p>
<p>I looked at the receptionist&#8217;s name tag and saw that it said, Milia.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the general counter. What can I do for you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I need to register as an adventurer&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>As I was about to ask her for help, I remembered Chrome-san&#8217;s advice.</p>
<p>Oops, I forgot that adventurers don&#8217;t use polite language.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d like to register as an adventurer, is that okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You want to register?&#8221;</p>
<p>Milia&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; I thought you were an adventurer who had been active in another country.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m just a rookie. Sorry to disappoint you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, no, I just misunderstood you myself! Please don&#8217;t worry about it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Milia said and took out a sheet of paper from under the counter.</p>
<p>It says &#8220;Adventurer&#8217;s Guild Registration Application&#8221; on it.</p>
<p>&#8220;The first thing you need to do is fill out this form. After that, you will have to take a practical test.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay. Can I use the pen?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. You can use it all you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>I took the pen and quickly filled out the necessary information. In addition to my name, age, and gender, I had to fill out some checklist options, such as &#8220;Do you have any chronic diseases&#8221; and &#8220;Do you have a criminal record?&#8221;</p>
<p>At the bottom of the form, there was an &#8220;Appeal&#8221; section, where you could freely write your best weapons and skills.</p>
<p>I thought about it for a while and then wrote down that I was not good at rough stuff.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is this okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, let me check.&#8221;</p>
<p>Milia then read the application form and tilted her head at the last part.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not good at rough stuff&#8230; Um, you&#8217;re kidding, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m serious. I don&#8217;t like to fight much if possible.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I-is that so&#8230;? I will accept this for now. The next step is the practical test. The instructor&#8217;s schedule is&#8230; Oh, he&#8217;s free at this time. What would you like to do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What does the practical test do?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a mock battle with the instructor. It is just&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Milia thought about it for a moment and then told me awkwardly.</p>
<p>&#8220;The person in charge of today&#8217;s test is a former A-ranked adventurer. He always says he&#8217;s stronger than an Armored Bear, so it might be a little tough.&#8221;</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Milia led me to the underground training ground.</p>
<p>Then, for some reason, a large group of adventurers followed behind us.</p>
<p>Hmm? What the heck is going on&#8230;?</p>
<p>As I tilted my head, I overheard the chatter of the surrounding crowd.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8216;The Bear Killer&#8217; is taking the registration test?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Huh? Are you kidding me? A monster who can take down an Armored Bear one-on-one is a rookie?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Young people these days are so far from being human&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we&#8217;re here, let&#8217;s go observe the test. I&#8217;d like to see what he&#8217;s capable of.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s instructor is&#8230; Oh, Gise-san?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;He&#8217;s the self-proclaimed &#8216;stronger than Armored Bear&#8217; guy, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But he&#8217;s really killed an Armored Bear, hasn&#8217;t he?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s see who&#8217;s stronger&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Since we&#8217;re here, how about a bet? I bet on the &#8216;Bear Killer.'&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think he&#8217;s gonna win, too!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, we can&#8217;t make a bet if we both have the same choice.&#8221;</p>
<p>I let out a small sigh as I looked at the excited adventurers.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not a freak show, you know.</p>
<p>However, the &#8220;&#8216;Bear Killer&#8217; vs. the self-proclaimed &#8216;Stronger than a Bear&#8217; guy&#8221; sounds like an interesting matchup, and if I were an adventurer, I would have probably joined the bet as well.</p>
<p>Before the instructor arrived, Milia told me about the practical test.</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh geez! You don&#8217;t have to beat the instructor in the practical test!&#8221;</p>
<p>Milia began to talk with the tension of a late-night shopping show. She&#8217;s amusing, isn&#8217;t she? I never get tired of watching her.</p>
<p>&#8220;As long as you can show the minimum level of competence as an adventurer, it&#8217;s okay to lose to the instructor. &#8230;Well, I have a feeling that Kou-san will win this one.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m not going to let my guard down. I&#8217;ll give it my all.&#8221;</p>
<p>I took out the Hikino wooden hammer from my <b>[Item Box]</b>.</p>
<p>It was a giant hammer. If I hit it correctly, it would crush any adult into a pulp.</p>
<p>I gripped the hammer, which was very heavy. It probably weighed over a hundred kilograms.</p>
<p>However, thanks to the Armored Bear Armor&#8217;s granting effect&#8230;<b>《Monstrous Strength S+》</b>, I was able to lift it with ease. Because I have the <b>[Dexterity]</b>, I can use any weapon for the first time like an expert.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I wanted to try out the weapon at least once.</p>
<p>I held the hammer over my left shoulder and took a full swing&#8230; like a baseball bat.</p>
<p><i>Whoosh!</i></p>
<p>The wind pressure was quite strong, and the adventurers in the surroundings began to make a lot of noise.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow&#8230;! How can he swing such a heavy-looking hammer so lightly&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s the &#8216;Bear Killer&#8217; for you, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Today&#8217;s instructor is dead&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The next thing I knew, the mood in the training area was like that of a wake.</p>
<p>That was when the instructor appeared.</p>
<p>He was a middle-aged man, wearing silver-rimmed glasses.</p>
<p>&#8220;So you are the &#8216;Bear Killer&#8217; everyone is talking about, huh? I hear you&#8217;re pretty strong, but you&#8217;re still young. I&#8217;ll show you that there is always someone better than you.&#8221;</p>
<p>As he said that, the instructor took off his glasses and picked up a wooden sword that was placed at the edge of the training area.</p>
<p>He looks like a seasoned veteran, and I&#8217;m sure he&#8217;s quite skilled. This is an opponent I can&#8217;t let my guard down against.</p>
<p>The instructor and I faced each other at a distance of about five meters.</p>
<p>We were surrounded by a crowd of spectators.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then you two, are you ready!&#8221;</p>
<p>Milia shouted excitedly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Let the test begin!&#8221;</p>
<p>As I lifted the hammer, I looked at the instructor. The instructor held his wooden sword in front of him and said with a relaxed expression on his face.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not a contest, but a test. You can attack me whenever you want.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. Then I&#8217;ll take your word for it&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>I kicked the ground and started to run, and with the momentum I had, I swung the hammer full sideways. However, the instructor jumped back and avoided the attack by a paper-thin margin.</p>
<p>&#8220;Your attack is too wide. There are too many gaps.&#8221;</p>
<p>The instructor grinned and swung his wooden sword down as a counterattack. But that&#8217;s exactly what I&#8217;m aiming for.</p>
<p>I activated my <b>[Item Box]</b> and stored the hammer.</p>
<p>Since I let go of my weapon, my body became lighter. I jumped sideways and quickly avoided the instructor&#8217;s slash.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What?&#8221;</p>
<p>The instructor&#8217;s eyes widened in surprise.</p>
<p>Now is the chance.</p>
<p>I took out my hammer again from my <b>[Item Box]</b> and took a second full swing.</p>
<p><i>Smack!</i></p>
<p>With a pleasant sound, the instructor&#8217;s wooden sword snapped in the middle. The top half of the sword flew into the air and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s it!&#8221;</p>
<p>Milia&#8217;s voice rang out energetically.</p>
<p>&#8220;This match was won by Kou-san!&#8221;</p>
<p>The testing room was silent for a while, but then it was filled with loud cheers.</p>
<p>&#8220;Wow! That rookie has beaten the instructor!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Not bad. As expected of the &#8216;Bear Killer&#8217;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was an interesting match!&#8221;</p>
<p>The instructor put down his broken wooden sword and approached me with a smiling face.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m completely defeated. Nice work, Kou-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, sir. You are not hurt, are you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Of course. By the way, the skill you used was <b>[Item Box]</b>, right? I never thought there was a way to use it like that. The world is really a big place. I learned something. Thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The instructor said that and held out his right hand. I extended my right hand to shake his.</p>
<p>&#8220;You have passed the test. I expect great things from you in the future.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations, Kou-san! You were very cool!&#8221;</p>
<p>Milia shouted, and the rest of the crowd applauded and congratulated me on my success.</p>
<p>And so&#8230;</p>
<p>In this lively welcoming mood, I took my first steps as an adventurer.</p>
