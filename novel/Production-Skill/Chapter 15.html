<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; I Tried To Prepare For The Black Dragon</h3>

<p>&#8220;First of all, calm down. What exactly happened?&#8221;</p>
<p>When I asked, the Glasses Slime took a deep breath and began to speak with a serious expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Actually, it looks like the black dragon will be reviving soon.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Even though we don&#8217;t have a lot of time, it&#8217;s getting even shorter!</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;It&#8217;s so difficult.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kou-san, maybe this means we won&#8217;t be able to evacuate in time&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>I was not the only one who was shocked by the news from the Glasses Slime. Iris had her hand over her mouth, and Relic&#8217;s eyes were wide open, both with surprise on their faces.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Chief Zitan and Milia had confused expressions on their faces.</p>
<p>&#8220;Black dragon&#8230;? Shouldn&#8217;t the dragon race have perished a long time ago?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Kou-san. Could you tell us more about it if you don&#8217;t mind?&#8221;</p>
<p>I&#8217;d like to say okay&#8230; but if we&#8217;re going to talk about the black dragon, I&#8217;d like to show them the images from the deep realm too.</p>
<p>Should we move the location?</p>
<p>When I was thinking about it, the Glasses Slime opened its mouth wide.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eiii!&#8221;</p>
<p>A spherical object popped out from inside. It was the crystal ball that was supposed to be in the deep realm.</p>
<p>Oops! I caught it as it flew towards me.</p>
<p>&#8220;It looks like we have new visitors, so I brought it just in case.&#8221;</p>
<p>Nice assist, Glasses Slime.</p>
<p>When I touched the crystal ball, it activated and projected an image into the empty space.</p>
<p>It was a scene from four thousand years ago. A black dragon appeared and wiped out the city in an instant. It&#8217;s the second time I&#8217;ve seen this, but it&#8217;s so horrific that I wanted to turn my gaze away.</p>
<p>&#8220;The great flood alone is a desperate situation, but this is just too much&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>As expected, Chief Zitan seemed to be shaken, and he gulped. Milia&#8217;s eyes were closed tightly, and she was trembling slightly as she grabbed the hem of her dress.</p>
<p>&#8220;We were living near a sleeping monster like that&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Milia&#8217;s knees collapsed. I immediately caught her body. The blood had completely drained from her face. She usually spoke and acted in a high-spirited manner, but she might be quite sensitive on the inside.</p>
<p>In the midst of the grim atmosphere, I asked the Glasses Slime.</p>
<p>&#8220;How many days will the black dragon be revived? In the first place, why is it being revived so soon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, but I can&#8217;t predict how much time is left. However, I do know the cause. &#8230;I&#8217;ve analyzed it with the deep realm system, and it&#8217;s probably due to the great flood.&#8221;</p>
<p>Hearing this, I came up with a hypothesis.</p>
<p>The place where the black dragon is sleeping and the place where the great flood is happening&#8230;</p>
<p>Both places are in the northern Phatos Mountains. Isn&#8217;t it possible that the simultaneous troubles occurring in the same place may have an effect?</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, itâ€™s exactly as Master-san surmised. Before the great flood, high concentrations of magical elements were generated, but it seems that this stimulated the black dragon&#8230;&#8221; </p>
<p>The Glasses Slime told us this with a heavy sigh.</p>
<p>&#8220;There are other problems as well. As the black dragon stirs, the signs of the great flood are getting stronger.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In other words, what do you mean?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think it will happen much sooner than expected. At least it should be fine until tomorrow morning, but after that, it&#8217;s hard to say&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Glasses Slime lowered its eyes apologetically.</p>
<p>If we take everything into consideration, there is a possibility that either a large army of monsters or a black dragon, or both, will attack Aunen by noon tomorrow. &#8230;Will we really be able to evacuate in time?</p>
<p>&#8220;Kou-kun.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chief Zitan called out to me with a grave expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will return to the city immediately to prepare for evacuation. We have to hurry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;All right. Well then, I&#8217;ll go back with you and help&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Master-san, please wait a minute!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the Glasses Slime who interrupted my words.</p>
<p>&#8220;If possible, I&#8217;d like you to stay here, Master-san. There&#8217;s a place I want to show you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A place you want to show me?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;There is a vault in the depths of the deep realm. People from four thousand years ago left some treasures for you, so please take them with you. It will surely come in handy.&#8221;</p>

<p>With Glasses Slime&#8217;s suggestion, I decided to act alone. The rest of the group returned to the city to prepare for the evacuation.</p>
<p>&#8220;It will be an all-night job, but I&#8217;ll try to get as many people as possible to the underground city. This is my responsibility.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chief Zitan said firmly and left the underground city with a determined look on his face. His back was big and reliable. I think I can trust him.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it were true, I&#8217;d like to stick with Kou-san and visit the ancient vaults.&#8221;</p>
<p>Relic muttered in a joking tone and then quickly turned serious.</p>
<p>&#8220;But I know how to prioritize things. When the evacuation is over, please show me the vault. I beg you.&#8221;</p>
<p>The reason Relic was returning to the city was to use his position to influence the people of the city.</p>
<p>He is a member of a duke family and a professor at the Royal Academy. If such a person strongly calls for evacuation, it will surely have a great effect.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much, Kou-san, for providing us with shelter.&#8221;</p>
<p>Milia bowed and then walked straight up to me and whispered softly in my ear.</p>
<p>&#8220;You supported me when I was about to fall down a while ago. I was so happy that you helped me.&#8221;</p>
<p>Milia smiled like a little girl and walked out of the underground city with a light step.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;You two get along so well, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Iris muttered as she shrugged her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going to take the three of them back to Aunen and then return to the underground city afterward. &#8230;There&#8217;s one thing I need to tell you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t we talk about it now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s probably a long story. I don&#8217;t want to keep the chief waiting, so I&#8217;ll see you later.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay. See you later.&#8221;</p>
<p>We both raised our right fists and lightly bumped them in the air.</p>

<p>After the four of them left the underground ruins, I decided to head for the vaults with the Glasses Slime.</p>
<p>I touched the black stone tablet to enter the deep realm.</p>
<p>We walked down a long, narrow corridor and arrived at a rather spacious room. This was the place where I had been shown the image of the black dragon a few hours ago.</p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t noticed it at the time, but there was a small door in the darkness on the far right of the room.</p>
<p>In the center of the door was what looked like a handle.</p>
<p>&#8220;Master-san! Please touch that door!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Like this?&#8221;</p>
<p>I reached out my right hand and grasped the door handle. Then I hear an inorganic voice in my head.</p>
l
<p><b>The link with the underground city core system has been established by [Full Assist]. Opening the vault entrance.</b></p>

<p>The door automatically opens to the back. The inside was connected to another small room.</p>
<p>The room was square, with three doors placed in a row at the back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Which door am I supposed to open?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Err, wait a minute. I have a message for you from the people of four thousand years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Glasses Slime lowered its eyes and said in a slightly solemn voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;<i>If you are a hero, the door on the left will open; if you are a demon king, the door in the middle will open; if you are a sage, the door on the right will open. You shall inherit our legacy</i>.&#8221; &#8230;Which of the following applies to you, Master-san?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;None of them apply to me&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eehh?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Glasses Slime rolled its eyes in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;W-what do you mean by that, Master-san&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;A lot was going on back then.&#8221;</p>
<p>To be more specific, I gave a backhanded answer in the first option.</p>
<ol>
<li>Hero, Demon King, Sage &#8211; which role do you want to be assigned?</li>
<li>I don&#8217;t want to choose any of them.</li>
</ol>
<p>As a result, I was transferred to the other world as a special kind of being.</p>
<p>If choosing to be a hero, a demon king, or a sage is the normal route, then I guess I&#8217;m going through some sort of backdoor route right now.</p>
<p>As I stepped into the square room thinking about this, a voice echoed in my brain.</p>

<p><b>&#8230;Status check complete.</b></p>
<p><b>Kou Kousaka is not a hero, demon king, or sage and possesses [Creation].</b></p>
<p><b>All doors will be unlocked since the hidden conditions have been met.</b></p>
l
<p>Then I heard three overlapping clacking sounds.</p>
<p>&#8230;This development was indeed unexpected.</p>
<p>If it were a proper route, there would only be one type of treasure available. But in my case, I unlocked all three.</p>
<p>I guess the results are just as out of the ordinary as much as how my existence is also out of the ordinary.</p>
<p>&#8220;Awawawawa, w-what&#8217;s going on&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The Glasses Slime was so shocked that it was spinning its eyes around in circles.</p>
<p>I chuckled at the sight of it and first opened the door on the left.</p>
<p>This is the place where the hero is supposed to enter.</p>
<p>At first, there was a long, narrow corridor, but after a while, I came to a large room. The width and depth of the room were probably more than ten meters.</p>
<p>In the center of the room was a horizontal pedestal on which a large sword was resting.</p>
<p>The blade, however, was rusted to a crumbling pulp, and it was split into two halves because it had been broken in the middle.</p>
<p>As it was, it didn&#8217;t look like it could be used properly.</p>
<p>&#8220;Master-san, may I have a word?&#8221;</p>
<p>I heard the voice of the Glasses Slime from behind me. It seemed that it had come out of its confused state.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a dragon-slaying magic sword. It has been handed down since the time of mythology, but it was shattered by the black dragon in the battle four thousand years ago. The story goes that if a hero gets hold of it, it will come back to life&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Unfortunately, I&#8217;m not a hero.&#8221;</p>
<p>As I say that, I collect the sword in the <b>[Item Box</b>].</p>
<p>Then, a recipe for <b>[Creation]</b> popped into my mind.</p>

<p><b>Broken Magic Sword (top) + Broken Magic Sword (bottom) â†’ Dragon-Slayer&#8217;s Magic Sword Gram</b></p>

<p>Apparently, it is possible to restore the magic sword without being a hero.</p>
<p>Magic Sword Gram, huh?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s often a name I&#8217;ve heard in anime and games, but I believe it originally came from Norse mythology.</p>
<p>I wonder what kind of performance it really has.</p>
<p>I activated<b> [Creation]</b> and my heart was pounding with anticipation.</p>

<p><b>Dragon-Slayer&#8217;s Magic Sword Gram: In mythology, the God of War is said to have given this magic sword to the hero. It was once shattered by the black dragon but was given new life by Kou Kousaka. Its performance has been explosively increased due to the [Creation] granting effect.</b></p>
<p><b>Granted effects: ã€ŠGod of War&#8217;s Blessing A+ã€‹ã€ŠDragon Slayer S+ã€‹ã€ŠGod of War Slash S+ã€‹</b></p>

<p>So, how was the rusty, battered sword after being reforged?</p>
<p>I took out the Gram from my <b>[Item Box]</b>.</p>
<p>It was a huge sword, over two meters long.</p>
<p>It was quite heavy, but thanks to the Armored Bear Armor&#8217;s<b>ã€ŠMonstrous Strength S+ã€‹</b>, I could lift it easily. I think I can handle it with one hand. The blade shone with dazzling silver color, brightly illuminating the surroundings.</p>
<p>&#8220;Eeeeeehhhhhh!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Glasses Slime shouted in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re not a hero, are you, Master-san? How did you fix the sword?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you hear from the other Slimes?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I have the <b>[Creation]</b> skill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The God&#8217;s skill&#8230;! Well, then you can restore the magic sword to its original state&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>It&#8217;s back to normal, or rather, it has become more powerful.</p>
<p>Gram has been granted three effects by <b>[Creation]</b>.</p>
<p>The first is the<b>ã€ŠGod of War&#8217;s Blessing A+ã€‹</b>, which greatly increases Gram&#8217;s sharpness and durability. It also comes with the bonus of self-regeneration. If Gram is chipped, it will be restored in a few minutes, and if it is shattered, it will be restored in a day. That alone is an extraordinary performance, but when fighting dragons, the<b>ã€ŠDragon Slayer S+ã€‹</b>is activated, increasing the performance even more. Also, it seems that it strengthens my physical abilities as well.</p>
<p>The<b>ã€ŠGod of War Slash S+ã€‹</b>is like a special move and is activated by giving Gram magical power. It shoots out a slash of light, slashing down enemies in the distance in one fell swoop. Of course, it is also capable of damaging dragons in the sky. It is truly a sword for killing dragons.</p>
<p>&#8220;Will this be able to defeat the black dragon&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, I shouldn&#8217;t be overconfident, but it&#8217;s worth a try.</p>

<p>There was nothing else in the room, so I turned back to the first small room.</p>
<p>This time, I entered the central door.</p>
<p>This is where the demon king is supposed to enter.</p>
<p>As I walked down the long, narrow corridor, I found a space the size of a school gymnasium, with a huge artillery structure occupying about two-thirds of the space. It was an extraordinary size.</p>
<p>Its total length, including the barrel, was over twenty meters, and its total width was probably over ten meters.</p>
<p>The armor covering it was made of Orichalcum, giving it a massive look that made me want to call it an artillery fortress.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is a super high-powered magic laser cannon. It can burn down a large area for several minutes, so it&#8217;s recommended when fighting hordes of monsters.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Will it work against the black dragon?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a weapon that was developed as a countermeasure to the great flood, so it&#8217;s a little unsuitable to deal with the black dragon. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. This could be useful.&#8221;</p>
<p>Gram for the black dragon and the super high-powered magic laser cannon for the great flood. I can use it in that way.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, do you want to take it with you?&#8221;</p>
<p>I touched the super high-powered magic laser cannon and thought of storing it in my <b>[Item Box]</b>. Then a huge magic circle appears on the ground and sucks the artillery in with a blinding light.</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazing&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Glasses Slime gasped.</p>
<p>&#8220;Only a demon king should be able to take out the super high-powered magic laser cannon from here&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p>
<p>When I asked back, <b>[Full Assist]</b> automatically activated and added the information.</p>

<p><b>The demon king has a large-capacity [Item Box], which can hold the super high-powered magic laser cannon.</b></p>

<p>Large capacity? Wait a minute.</p>
<p>Does that mean that the demon king has an unlimited capacity like me?</p>

<p><b>Kou Kousaka is a special existence, and the capacity of the [Item Box] is infinite!</b></p>

<p>It&#8217;s kind of understandable and yet incomprehensible&#8230;</p>
<p>After that, I could no longer hear the voice in my mind, but I did understand one thing.</p>
<p>I refused to be a hero, a demon king, or a sage, but there seems to be no downside to that. In fact, I&#8217;m getting a much bigger advantage than if I had chosen any one of them.</p>
<p>The skills are upwardly compatible with each of them, and in this vault, all the doors were unlocked. It&#8217;s a total win.</p>
<p>If this were a game, it must be the final route that would only be released after clearing the three routes: the hero route, the demon king route, and the sage route.</p>
<p>&#8230;Well, so much for the jokes.</p>
<p>I have stored the super high-powered magic laser cannon in my <b>[Item Box]</b>, and now a new recipe has come to mind.</p>

<p><b>Orichalcum Golem (Broken) + Super High Power Magic Laser Cannon â†’ Destroyer Golem</b></p>

<p>This is a combination I didn&#8217;t expect.</p>
<p>Well, they both originated from ancient civilizations, so in that sense, it might be the best match.</p>
<p>I thought about it for a while and then activated <b>[Creation]</b>.</p>
<p>The Orichalcum Golem and the super high-powered magic laser cannon are both very powerful ancient weapons, but I wonder how powerful they will be when they become cheat items through <b>[Creation]</b>.</p>
<p>To be honest, I&#8217;m quite looking forward to it.</p>

<p><b>Destroyer Golem: A giant golem clad in armor made of Orichalcum, it has acquired the power to be called the ultimate weapon against the great flood through [Creation]. It is equipped with a super high-powered magic laser cannon in its right eye and a rapid-fire magic laser cannon in each hand.</b></p>
<p><b>Granted effects:ã€ŠAdvanced Processing Function A+ã€‹ã€ŠMonster Detection Sã€‹ã€ŠEternal Engine S+ã€‹</b></p>

<p>The ultimate weapon, huh?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s an auspicious phrase.</p>
<p>The fact it has a vaguely chuunibyou vibe to it is also a high point for me personally.</p>
<p>When I thought of taking it out of my <b>[Item Box]</b>, a magic circle floated to the ground.</p>
<p>From within the magic circle, a black giant of steel slowly rises. It looks like a scene from a robot animation.</p>
<p>On the Destroyer Golem&#8217;s head, two blue eyes glowed warmly. A low, roaring drive sound came from its body, and it spoke in an electronic voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hello, Master. Nice to meet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Despite its rugged appearance, the mechanical giant was quite polite. It bowed slowly and extended its right hand to me.</p>
<p>Is it asking me to shake its hand?</p>
<p>I extended my right hand and touched the giant&#8217;s hand.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you very much. Please leave me in charge in the case of a great flood.&#8221;</p>
<p>After the handshake (?) The Destroyer Golem straightened its back and stretched out its chest with confidence.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s like a human being, but this is due to the<b>ã€ŠAdvanced Processing Function A+ã€‹</b>.</p>
<p>The ordinary Orichalcum Golem is also equipped with artificial intelligence, but the Destroyer Golem is a very high-performance one. Not only can it understand commands from me, but it also seems to be able to greet me, talk to me regularly, and even suggest strategies and tactics.</p>
<p>&#8220;Slime-san too, nice to meet you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Y-yeah&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The Slime&#8217;s eyes were rolling around again.</p>
<p>&#8220;M-Master-san, what&#8217;s really happening&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I used <b>[Creation]</b>. The materials were the super high-powered magic laser cannon and the Orichalcum Golem that I defeated a while back.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Amazing&#8230;! You&#8217;ve created a new golem&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s about it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I nodded and touched the feet of the Destroyer Golem.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will call you when it&#8217;s your turn. Can I put you back in the <b>[Item Box]</b>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Understood. I&#8217;ll be waiting.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah, see you later.&#8221;</p>
<p>As soon as I thought of storing it in my <b>[Item Box]</b>, a magic circle appeared at the feet of the Destroyer Golem. In a flash of light, the Destroyer Golem disappeared along with the magic circle.</p>

ï¸Ž<p style= "text-align:center;">â—‡â—‡â—‡</p>

<p>There were no other items that I could acquire, so I walked back to the small room and opened the door on the far right.</p>
<p>Normally, only the sage could enter this room. I wondered what kind of items were prepared there.</p>
<p>I walked down the long, narrow corridor and eventually arrived at a space about four and a half tatami mats in size. [T/n: Around 7 square meters.]</p>
<p>In the center was an altar. When I peeked over the top, I saw that it was decorated with three pieces of a shattered shield. There was some kind of emblem drawn on the shield&#8217;s surface, but the outline was unclear because of the rust.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s the Dragon God&#8217;s shield. It has been handed down from the time of mythology, but it was shattered by the black dragon in the battle four thousand years ago.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Doesn&#8217;t it have the same description as the Gram?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh! Really!&#8221;</p>
<p>You weren&#8217;t aware of it, huh?</p>
<p>The Glasses Slime jumped up and down in surprise.</p>
<p>&#8220;But, it&#8217;s not the hero who can restore this; it&#8217;s the sage. Well, I think Master-san can fix it with <b>[Creation]</b>&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s give it a try.&#8221;</p>
<p>I collect the shield into my <b>[Item Box]</b>. But surprisingly, no new recipes came to mind.</p>
<p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t seem to fix it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Maybe you don&#8217;t have the right materials.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I wonder what it needs?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You need a special jewel called the Dragon God&#8217;s Red Jade. I heard that you could get it only once in a thousand years in the land of the Dragon-folk, but I don&#8217;t know the details. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I guess we don&#8217;t have time to go to another country right now.&#8221;</p>
<p>Well, even with just Gram and the Destroyer Golem, it&#8217;s quite an accomplishment.</p>
<p>We left the vault and headed back to the underground city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Good night, Master-san! Thank you for coming to the vault!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I should be the one to thank you. We were able to strengthen our forces considerably, and I really appreciate it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome! Oh, one last thing! Please stay still!&#8221;</p>
<p>What the heck is the matter?</p>
<p>When I stopped, the Glasses Slime extended its tentacles toward me. It touched the back of my left hand and whispered to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;â”€â”€May the spirits bless you, Master-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>I can feel the heat coming from where it touched me.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a good luck charm from me! If you have any problems, the spirits will be there to help you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s reassuring.&#8221;</p>
<p>I smiled and crouched down, patting the Glasses Slime on the head.</p>

<p>Come to think of it, what is a spirit?</p>
<p>At the entrance to the underground city, there was a sign that said, &#8220;May the spirits bless you,&#8221; and if I go back in my memory, I think I saw a similar message just before I was transferred to another world.</p>
<p>As I thought that, the<b> [Full Assist] </b>was activated, and I heard a voice in my mind.</p>

<p><b>Spirits are beings born from the strong thoughts of people. They are invisible to the eye, but they are always watching over you.</b></p>

ï¸Ž<p style= "text-align:center;">â—‡â—‡â—‡</p>

<p>I asked the Glasses Slime to use transfer magic on me, and I returned to the underground city. The transfer point is at the city&#8217;s edge, in front of the first house I built.</p>
<p>It might be a good idea to turn this house into my home.</p>
<p>As I thought about this, an inorganic voice sounded in my brain.</p>

<p><b>Contact from the main system of the underground city. Do you wish to allow Irisnot Fafnir to enter?</b></p>

<p>Apparently, Iris had returned.</p>
<p>She said she wanted to talk to me later, so I guess that&#8217;s why she returned from Aunen.</p>
<p>About five minutes after I gave permission for her to enter, Iris arrived.</p>
<p>&#8220;Here you are, Kou. How was the vault?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was quite a turnout. Why don&#8217;t we talk in the house for now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see. Well, I guess I&#8217;ll take your word for it.&#8221;</p>
<p>I walked Iris into the house.</p>
<p>At the house entrance, A Helper Slime was waiting for us and gave us a slight bow.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome back, Master-san! You haven&#8217;t had your dinner yet, right? Shall I make you something?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Sure. Please do. What about you, Iris?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Me too, please. I haven&#8217;t eaten anything since lunch, and my head is starting to spin.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Awawawa! That&#8217;s a big problem! I&#8217;ll get it ready right away!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Helper Slime jumped up and headed for the kitchen, bouncing up and down as if in a panic.</p>
<p>We decided to wait for the food while talking in the living room.</p>
<p>The sofa was in the shape of a U, with a table in the middle. I sat on the underside of the sofa, and Iris sat diagonally across from me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iris, how was the city?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The preparations for the evacuation are going well. The rest is a race against time. &#8230;Can you tell me about the vault?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>
<p>I briefly explain the items I acquired in the vault.</p>
<p>Gram, the dragon-slayer&#8217;s magic sword. The super high-powered magic laser cannon and the Destroyer Golem that was created from it. And the Dragon God&#8217;s shield that was shattered into three pieces.</p>
<p>When I finished talking about the shield, Iris put her hand over her mouth and pondered, then opened her mouth with a serious expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t told you why I&#8217;m looking for the ruins of an ancient civilization, have I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, you&#8217;re right. Are you going to tell me now?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. I&#8217;m rather sorry it took me so long to tell you. &#8230;The reason I left the land of the Dragon-folk was to look for the Dragon God&#8217;s shield. The Dragon God&#8217;s Shield was originally a precious treasure of the Dragon-folk, but it went missing four thousand years ago in a battle against the calamity.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Four thousand years ago&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The time is right around the time of the fall of the ancient civilization. In order to find out the whereabouts of the shield, Iris may have decided to search the ruins first.</p>
<p>&#8220;A treasure of the Dragon-folk, it would be a lot of trouble if I had it.&#8221;</p>
<p>It would be better to give the Dragon God&#8217;s shield to Iris.</p>
<p>When I was about to take it out of my <b>[Item Box]</b>, Iris said, &#8220;Wait a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Is it possible to restore the Dragon God&#8217;s shield with Kou&#8217;s <b>[Creation]</b>?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s difficult now. According to Glasses Slime, it requires the Dragon God&#8217;s Red Jade to restore it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I have it right here.&#8221;</p>
<p>Eh?</p>
<p>That was a completely unexpected remark.</p>
<p>As I was puzzled, Iris took out a red ball from her waist pouch.</p>
<p>The ball was small enough to fit in the palm of her hand, and it shone brightly as if it were burning. It was like a miniature sun. I felt a warmth surrounding it.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iris, can I use the red ball?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8221;<i>If the </i><b><i>[Transmigrator] </i></b><i>has the shield, give them the red jade</i>&#8221; â”€â”€So says the legend of the Dragon-folk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Then. I won&#8217;t hesitate&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I store the Dragon God&#8217;s Red Jade in my <b>[Item Box]</b>.</p>
<p>Immediately after, a new recipe came into my mind.</p>
<p>The pieces of the shield and the Dragon God&#8217;s Red Jade. I use these as ingredients and activate <b>[Creation]</b>.</p>

<p><b>Dragon God&#8217;s Shield: A shield created by the Dragon God. Whenever a calamity is revived, it responds to it and shows its true value. It can only be used by those who possess the [Dragon God&#8217;s Shrine Maiden].</b></p>
<p><b>Granted effects: ã€ŠStrength Enhancement S+ã€‹ã€ŠDragon God&#8217;s Divine Protection Sã€‹ã€ŠDragon God&#8217;s Barrier EXã€‹</b></p>
l
<p>&#8230;Alright.</p>
<p>It seemed that the Dragon God&#8217;s shield had been properly restored. The <b>[Creation]</b> process granted it extra effect, and the performance was higher than it was before.</p>
<p>The<b>ã€ŠStrength Enhancement S+ã€‹</b>is just what it sounds like, and the<b>ã€ŠDragon God&#8217;s Divine Protection Sã€‹</b>activates when fighting a calamity. The effect seems to be that it amplifies the holder&#8217;s magical power and raises their physical abilities as well.</p>
<p>The<b>ã€ŠDragon God&#8217;s Barrier EXã€‹</b>can be used by consuming magic power to develop a powerful defensive barrier. It might even be able to protect against the black dragon&#8217;s fireball.</p>
<p>But since I don&#8217;t have the <b>[Dragon God&#8217;s Shrine Maiden]</b>, I can&#8217;t use the<b>ã€ŠDragon God&#8217;s Divine Protection Sã€‹</b>or the<b>ã€ŠDragon God&#8217;s Barrier EXã€‹</b>.</p>
<p>This is troublesome. It&#8217;s a waste of treasure.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kou, are you okay? Your expression looks very difficult&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Iris peeked at me with concern.</p>
<p>&#8220;Is there a problem?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m fine. The shield has been successfully restored. &#8230;However, it seems that in order to bring out the true power of the shield, you need to have the <b>[Dragon God&#8217;s Shrine Maiden]</b> skill.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not a problem, then.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iris lowered her eyes meaningfully and told me.</p>
<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s the <b>[Dragon God&#8217;s Shrine Maiden]</b>, then I have it.&#8221;</p>

ï¸Ž<p style= "text-align:center;">â—‡â—‡â—‡</p>

<p>With Iris&#8217;s permission, I used <b>[Appraisal]</b> to check her status, and she indeed had the <b>[Dragon God&#8217;s Shrine Maiden]</b> skill. The effect of this was to &#8220;draw out the power of items with the name &#8216;Dragon God&#8217;.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;â”€â”€It&#8217;s a very rare skill. It is said that only once every few hundred years, only a woman of the Dragon-folk can possess it.&#8221;</p>
<p>What Iris told me was one of the old legends of the Dragon-folk.</p>
<p>According to this, the <b>[Dragon God&#8217;s Shrine Maiden]</b> has two missions.</p>
<p>One is to search for the &#8220;Dragon God&#8217;s Shield.&#8221; The other is to hand over the Dragon God&#8217;s Red Jade to the <b>[Transmigrator]</b>.</p>
<p>It seemed that the previous shrine maiden was unable to fulfill her missions, but Iris has accomplished both of them.</p>
<p>Normally, she would have been overjoyed. However, Iris was calm and collected.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is not the time to get carried away. If the black dragon appears before the evacuation of Aunen can be completed, I will have to fight.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;In that case, I think Iris should keep the Dragon God&#8217;s shield.&#8221;</p>
<p>I took out the Dragon God&#8217;s shield from my <b>[Item Box]</b>.</p>
<p>It was a shield big enough to cover my body.</p>
<p>In the center of it, the Dragon God&#8217;s Red Jade was fitted, and it still shines with a red glow.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the Dragon God&#8217;s Shield, huh&#8230;? There are replicas in the land of the Dragon-folk, but the real thing has a different style&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Iris nervously reached out her hand and received the Dragon God&#8217;s shield.</p>
<p>&#8220;Once we overcome the black dragon&#8217;s return, I will return the shield properly. Please don&#8217;t worry about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. But this is originally a treasure of the Dragon-folk, isn&#8217;t it? Can I keep it?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a delicate matter. However, in the Dragon-folk&#8217;s legends, the <b>[Transmigrator]</b> is treated as a special being, and if Kou claims ownership, it will probably be accepted as it is.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Well, we can think about that after this case is over.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, I think so too.&#8221;</p>
<p>We both chuckled and nodded at each other.</p>
<p>Just in time, a delicious smell drifted from the kitchen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Master-san! Onee-san! The food is ready!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Helper Slime came in with a cheerful voice and brought the food.</p>
<p>The menu was quite lavish: thick corn cream soup, grilled cheese with hot vegetables, fluffy bread, and a mountain of roast beef.</p>
<p>Each dish was excellent, but this time the bread was a big hit. It could be dipped in soup, topped with grilled cheese, or sandwiched between two pieces of roast beef.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bargain to be able to taste so many different things in one meal, isn&#8217;t it?</p>
<p>As for dessert, we had vanilla ice cream, the simple sweetness of which soaked my tongue.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t wait to feel the sugar flowing into my brain.</p>
<p>The full stomach made me feel sleepy, but I have things to do now.</p>
<p>I need to discuss with Chief Zitan about the plans for tomorrow.</p>
<p>&#8220;I will return to Aunen now. What about you, Iris?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m coming with you. I can&#8217;t be the only one taking a break when everyone else is in trouble.&#8221;</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why Iris and I decided to return from the underground city.</p>
<p>We walked through the tunnel and up the stairs.</p>
<p>When we reached the surface, it was already late at night outside.</p>
<p>From the surrounding forest, we could hear the ringing&#8230; of the bellbirds.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a beautiful sound.&#8221;</p>
<p>Iris smiled at me. The moon was shining in the night sky, and its light was gently enveloping her.</p>
<p>Her shimmering crimson hair and pure white skin were as beautiful as a painting.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;What&#8217;s wrong, Kou?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s nothing.&#8221;</p>
<p>If I could have said one of those pretentious lines here, it would have made me look cool, but unfortunately, I&#8217;m not that kind of a character. I know where I stand.</p>
<p>We both walked straight to Aunen.</p>
<p>&#8220;Hey, Kou.&#8221;</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t long after we left the forest that Iris called out to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you remember the first time we came to this forest together?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That was my first quest, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You collected Naose Grass in the blink of an eye and devised new ways to collect it using the <b>[Item Box]</b>. When I think back, Kou has been out of the ordinary ever since then, havenâ€™t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;As for me, I thought I completed the quests as normal.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But what surprised me the most was the next day. You killed a Black Spider by yourself and saved my life when I was about to die, right?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s so surprising about that? A friend of mine is in trouble; it&#8217;s only natural for me to help.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Fufu, that&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s what Kou was thinking?&#8221;</p>
<p>Iris muttered happily and began to walk a little faster. When the distance between us opens up a little, she stops and looks back at me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve been treated poorly in the land of the Dragon-folk.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Is that so?&#8221;</p>
<p>Iris has the rare skill called <b>[Dragon God&#8217;s Shrine Maiden]</b>. Normally, she&#8217;d be given preferential treatment, but perhaps there was a reason for this?</p>
<p>&#8220;Whenever I was injured or sick, no one would help me. Of course, not even my parents.&#8221;</p>
<p>If that was true, this was a terrible story. In the beginning, Iris was closed off to the people around her, not only because of the prejudice against the Dragon-folk now, but also because of her upbringing.</p>
<p>&#8220;When I was almost killed by the Black Spider, I had completely given up. No one was going to come to my rescue. I thought I was going to die alone. But that didnâ€™t happen.&#8221;</p>
<p>Just then, a strong wind happened to blow. Iris&#8217;s long red hair flew up and hid her face for a moment.</p>
<p>Eventually, after the wind stopped blowing, she said with a strong look of determination.</p>
<p>&#8220;I was really happy that Kou came at that time. &#8230;I will repay that debt with my life. No matter how strong the black dragon is, I will definitely protect you.&#8221;</p>
