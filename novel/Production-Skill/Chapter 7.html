<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; I Tried To Fight A Black Spider</h3>


<p>On my way down the mountain road, I came across a female Lonely Wolf.</p>
<p>When I casually checked it with <b>[Appraisal]</b>, a surprising fact was revealed.</p>

<p><b>Lonely Wolf (Female) A wolf-type monster that prefers solitude. They mate during mating season and prey on males when they become pregnant.</b></p>

<p>Preying on males makes it seem like a praying mantis, doesn&#8217;t it&#8230;?</p>
<p>I wonder if the reason the hoard of male Lonely Wolf ran away was to avoid being eaten alive by the female? If that&#8217;s the case, it made sense. Everyone wants to save their own life, don&#8217;t they?</p>
<p>&#8220;Grrrrrrr!&#8221;</p>
<p>The female in front of me attacked me with a ferocious growl.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m indeed a male, but I&#8217;m not a Lonely Wolf, you know.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to become food, so I swing my hikino wooden sword to strike back.</p>
<p>Then I heard a voice announcing my level up.</p>

<p><b>With this experience gain, you are now level 16, your HP and MP have increased, and your physical abilities have improved!</b></p>

<p>I was only level 8 when I left the city of Aunen, so I&#8217;ve leveled up quite a bit.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s time for me to check my status properly once again.</p>

<p><b>Kou Kousaka, age twenty-nine, male, human, level 16, HP200, MP3100</b></p>
<p><b>Skills: [Transmigrator] [Full Assist] [Creation] [Dexterity] [Artisan&#8217;s Divine Eye] [Item Box] [Dismantling] [Appraisal] [Automatic Collection]</b></p>

<p><b>[Automatic Collection]</b> was learned in this battle, but I wonder if more skills would be added as I level up. If so, I&#8217;m looking forward to it.</p>
<p>As I was walking down the mountain thinking about this, I found a large spring.</p>
<p>The view was not bad, and there was a rock to sit on.</p>
<p>Just as I was about to take a break for lunch&#8230; I noticed two adventurers sitting a short distance away.</p>
<p>A boy in armor and a girl dressed in white.</p>
<p>If I were to describe them in RPG style, I&#8217;d say they were a swordsman and a priest.</p>
<p>Both were young and had the air of novice adventurers. They were both gasping for breath- perhaps they escaped from a monster?</p>
<p>Anyway, since they were adventurers, I thought I&#8217;d at least say hello.</p>
<p>&#8220;You look like you&#8217;re in trouble. Are you okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>As I approached, the two slowly turned to look at me. Both of them had complex expressions and seemed to be terribly frightened.</p>
<p>&#8220;That armor&#8230; are you perhaps the &#8216;Bear Killer&#8217;?&#8221;</p>
<p>The swordsman boy asked me, and I nodded.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Kou Kousaka, an F-rank adventurer. Please call me Kou instead of &#8216;Bear Killer&#8217; if you can.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Um&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The priestess looked up at me as if she wanted to say something.</p>
<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well, um, I think you should get off the mountain if you can&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Did you get attacked by an Armored Bear?&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked, and the swordsman boy answered, &#8220;No.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;It was a huge spider-like monster. It was big and fast, and we were no match for it. &#8230;maybe it&#8217;s a Black Spider.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Black Spider is an A+ danger level monster, and if it were real, it would be living farther into the mountains.&#8221;</p>
<p>The girl added.</p>
<p>&#8220;But somehow, it seems to have made its way out to this area&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>When I asked them about the situation in detail, they told me that they were new adventurers who had just become E rank. Today, they were visiting Fatos Mountain for a gathering quest. It was a job that was appropriate for their rank and should have been less dangerous.</p>
<p>However, they had the misfortune of running into a Black Spider.</p>
<p>The Black Spider was much more powerful than the Armored Bear, and there was no way that either the boy or the girl would have survived.</p>
<p>&#8220;But then an A-ranked adventurer happened to pass by.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;She was a woman from the dragon-folk tribe&#8230; I think her name was Iris.&#8221;</p>
<p>I was a little surprised when a name I knew suddenly came up.</p>
<p>The first impression of Iris was that she was an indifferent and cold woman, but she was kind at heart and quite good-natured.</p>
<p>It seemed that she confronted the Black Spider single-handedly to let the boy and girl escape while she fought it.</p>
<p>&#8220;It is said that about fifteen adventurers of B rank or higher are needed to defeat the Black Spider.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priestess muttered with a dazed expression.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iris-san was badly injured because she protected us, and I&#8217;m sure that by now&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I wonder about that.&#8221;</p>
<p>The body of the dragon-folk tribe was much stronger than that of ordinary humans.</p>
<p>Iris might still be alive.</p>
<p>Then maybe I should go and help her. It is possible that it is too late, of course, but I want to believe in her survival.</p>
<p>&#8220;Do you know where the Black Spider is? Just give me a general direction.&#8221;</p>
<p>I asked, and the boy pointed across the fountain.</p>
<p>&#8220;Over there. Don&#8217;t tell me you&#8217;re going to&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll go find Iris. You two go down the mountain first.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Kou-san, that&#8217;s impossible. It&#8217;s too dangerous.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not trying to fight the Black Spider. It will be fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;But&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy looked at the girl with a troubled expression as if asking for help. But what came out of the girl&#8217;s mouth were not words to persuade me.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand. We will go down the mountain and ask for help from the adventurer&#8217;s guild. Please take care of Iris-san.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Eh? Wait a minute.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy made a puzzled voice.</p>
<p>&#8220;Why didn’t you stop him? In the first place, we don&#8217;t even know if the adventurer Iris is still alive.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I heard the voices of the spirits. They said that we should let Kou-san go.&#8221;</p>
<p>The priestess told him in a clear voice.</p>
<p>&#8230;Spirit?</p>
<p>Spirits had a familiar presence in fantasy anime and games, but its position varied greatly from one work to another. What kind of existence is a spirit in this world?</p>
<p>When I tilted my head, the priestess immediately answered my question.</p>
<p>&#8220;Spirits are invisible beings that control various natural phenomena. I have a skill called <b>[Spirit&#8217;s Guidance]</b>, and sometimes the spirits call out to me.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;We&#8217;ve been saved by the <b>[Spirit&#8217;s Guidance ]</b> many times before.&#8221;</p>
<p>The boy muttered to himself.</p>
<p>&#8220;If the spirit says so, I won&#8217;t stop you anymore. But please don&#8217;t overdo it.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Please be careful, Kou-san. ──May the gods and spirits bless you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you, both of you. I&#8217;ll be back.&#8221;</p>
<p>I thanked them both and left.</p>
<p>With the armored bear armor&#8217;s<b>《Hearing Enhancement A》</b>in effect, I continued along the mountain path.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iris, please, please stay alive&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>A cold sweat slipped down my right cheek. The worst-case scenario flashed through my mind, but I told myself that it would be okay.</p>
<p>I thought I was the calm and cautious type, but it seemed that I was mistaken. I guess I just haven&#8217;t encountered anything that would shake me up until now.</p>
<p><em>Aah</em>&#8230;</p>
<p>Hmm?</p>
<p>I think I just heard someone&#8217;s voice from my left.</p>
<p>&#8220;I better go check it out.&#8221;</p>
<p>In my experience, it&#8217;s better to follow my instincts in such cases. I turned to the left and continued my search for Iris, looking for signs in my surroundings.</p>
<p>Soon, the landscape around me began to turn a little more disturbing.</p>
<p>The trees were torn to shreds, and the corpses of Lonely Wolves were lying everywhere.</p>
<p>Was this the result of the Black Spider&#8217;s rampage?</p>
<p>As I continued, I found an extraordinary sight.</p>
<p>It was an open area.</p>
<p>Most of the trees had been cut down from the roots, and at the far end of the clearing&#8230; About thirty meters from here, Iris was lying on the ground. A pool of blood spreads out around her.</p>
<p>──Ugh.</p>
<p>I could hear her breathing painfully.</p>
<p>It seemed that Iris was still alive.</p>
<p>I continued to be vigilant as I approached her, step by step. To be honest, I wanted to run to her right now, but I considered the possibility of a trap.</p>
<p>And I was right.</p>
<p>I was about fifteen meters away from Iris when I felt my feet shake violently. I jumped back reflexively and saw something crawling out of the ground with a cloud of dust.</p>
<p>It was a giant spider, about the size of a light truck, with sharp fangs peeking out from its mouth.</p>
<p>Could this be the Black Spider?</p>
<p>I immediately activated my <b>[Appraisal]</b>.</p>

<p><b>Black Spider: A giant spider-shaped monster. It is highly intelligent and hunts its prey with a speed that is unimaginable from its huge body. Its body is covered with a special shell that makes it extremely resistant to magic. The paralyzing poison secreted from its fangs is very powerful, so be careful.</b></p>
<p><b>The thread it spits out of its mouth is extremely viscous but can be specially processed to become a high-grade material for clothing.</b></p>

<p>As for the Black Spider, it must have been hiding in the ground with the intention of ambushing anyone who came to save Iris.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s smart for a monster. That&#8217;s what I&#8217;d call an A+ danger level monster.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!&#8221;</p>
<p>With a cry, the Black Spider moved.</p>
<p>It closed the distance with an unimaginable speed from its huge body. It bore its fangs, and tried to bite me.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kuh&#8230;!&#8221;</p>
<p>Of course, I&#8217;m not going to be beaten silently.</p>
<p>I took out the wooden sword from my <b>[Item Box]</b> and activated <b>[Dexterity]</b>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haaaahhhhh!&#8221;</p>
<p>The slash that I launched as a counter, however, was dodged with a flutter. The Black Spider&#8217;s movements were as light as a butterfly.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t let down my attack. I stepped in and slashed it in succession. Some of the slashes inflicted shallow wounds on the Black Spider, but they were far from fatal.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Tch!&#8221;</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but click my tongue.</p>
<p>My objective was to rescue Iris. She&#8217;s been injured quite badly. She needed to be treated as soon as possible.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I didn’t have time to play around with the Black Spider, but the fight was becoming a back-and-forth stalemate.</p>
<p>If this continued, I wouldn’t be able to heal her in time, so I had to settle this quickly&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;Shaaaaaaaaaa!&#8221;</p>
<p>But my attack failed to deliver a decisive blow, and on the contrary, I was met with a counterattack.</p>
<p>It was a physical attack that took advantage of a momentary gap. I could not defend or evade and was flung away by the Black Spider&#8217;s huge body.</p>
<p>My body slammed into the ground, rolling over and over, and eventually crashed into the base of a nearby tree.</p>
<p>The impact was so severe that the bones of my entire body could have been torn apart, but the damage was not so severe.</p>
<p>Thanks to the defensive performance of the armored bear armor and having my body strengthened by the level-up.</p>
<p>The only damage I sustained was that I had to let go of my hikino wooden sword.</p>
<p>The weapon had fallen about five meters away.</p>
<p>I was about to stand up immediately when the Black Spider lifted its body and released a white thread from the tip of its tail.</p>
<p>It was as sticky as birdlime and stuck to my body. The thread was also entangled in the tree behind me.</p>
<p>I tried to get out, but I couldn&#8217;t. I was in a crucifixion-like situation.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shaaaaaaaaaaaaaa!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Black Spider roared in delight.</p>
<p><i>I&#8217;ve got you.</i> It felt like it was saying that.</p>
<p>I look for a way to escape. But my body doesn&#8217;t move a muscle.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the Black Spider was right in front of me. Sharp fangs peeked out from its large mouth.</p>
<p>Once that thing is thrusted into my throat, I&#8217;m sure I wouldn’t be able to survive.</p>
<p>It is said that when a human being is about to die, their concentration increases to the extreme in order to survive.</p>
<p>I was in that very state right now. Everything seemed to slow down.</p>
<p>Thoughts are sharpened and accelerated, and time is stretched to infinity.</p>
<p>In this moment that seemed like an eternity, my mind drifted back to the moment after I had been transported to another world.</p>
<p>I touched the hikino tree and stored it in the <b>[Item Box]</b>. The <b>[Item Box] </b>can store any object that is in contact with my body.</p>
<p>If so, then maybe&#8230;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;..!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was a close call.</p>
<p>I evaded the Black Spider&#8217;s fangs just in time and rolled around on the ground to get away from it.</p>
<p>The thread that had been attached to my body and the tree behind me disappeared from the spot without a trace.</p>
<p>As for what I did, the answer is simple.</p>
<p>I stored everything in my <b>[Item Box]</b>.</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t sure if it was actually possible, but apparently, the goddess of fortune hadn&#8217;t given up on me yet.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shaaaaah!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Black Spider&#8217;s eyes glazed over, and it let out a surprised grunt.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s good. Now let&#8217;s fight back.</p>
<p>I picked up the hikino wooden sword that had fallen to the ground and I noticed a large red spear lying near it. It&#8217;s Iris&#8217;s spear. I picked it up as well. <i>I want to help your master, so please help me</i>.</p>
<p>I held the wooden sword in my left hand and the large spear in my right.</p>
<p>Of course, I have activated my <b>[Dexterity]</b>.</p>
<p>&#8220;Haaaaahhhhh!&#8221;</p>
<p>I closed the distance at once and unleashed a slash.</p>
<p>I avoided the Black Spider by a hair&#8217;s breadth, but by that time, I had already moved on to my next attack.</p>
<p>A spear thrust. It gouged deeply into the Black Spider&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiiiiii!&#8221;</p>
<p>A scream echoed.</p>
<p>I didn’t let down on my attacks.</p>
<p>I slashed with my sword and pierced with the spear.</p>
<p>Every time I did, blood splattered from the Black Spider&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>The struggle I had just endured before seemed like a lie.</p>
<p>Perhaps its impatience for the match had prevented it from exercising its true abilities.</p>
<p>&#8220;Shhhhhh!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Black Spider, perhaps realizing its disadvantage, jumped back.</p>
<p>It turned its back on me and tried to run away.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;As if I would let you escape.&#8221;</p>
<p>I took a running start and threw the Iris spear. It flew in a magnificent parabola, pierced the Black Spider&#8217;s body from above at an angle, and plunged into the ground.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kiiiiiiiiiiii!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Black Spider screamed in agony.</p>
<p>It was stitched to the ground by Iris&#8217;s spear and could not leave the spot.</p>
<p>&#8220;This is the end.&#8221;</p>
<p>I swing down the hikino wooden sword.</p>
<p>The Black Spider was sliced in half on both sides and died.</p>
<p>Immediately after that, an inorganic voice sounded in my head.</p>

<p><b>With this experience gain, you are now level 24; your HP and MP will increase, and your physical abilities will improve.</b></p>
<p><b>Since you have reached the specified level, a new skill── [Auto Mapping] has been unlocked!</b></p>

<p>Apparently, a new skill had been unlocked.</p>
<p>This was the other world&#8217;s version of a map application, and when activated, a semi-transparent window appeared in front of me, displaying a map of the surrounding area. If I specified a destination, it seemed to be able to guide me along the route.</p>
<p>Normally, I would have tried various things, but I had more important things to do right now.</p>
<p>I turned off <b>[Auto Mapping]</b> and hurried over to Iris.</p>
<p>She was still alive, albeit barely. Her breathing was shallow, and it was clear that she was on the verge of death.</p>
<p>If she weren&#8217;t treated immediately, she would die soon.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Let&#8217;s do that.&#8221;</p>
<p>In my <b>[Item Box]</b>, I had a stockpile of potion ingredients. If I used it all up, I might be able to save Iris.</p>
