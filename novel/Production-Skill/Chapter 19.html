<h3>Chapter 19 &#8211; I Tried To Clean Up Properly</h3>


<p>My body was wrapped in golden light from the<b> [Spirit Blessing]</b>, but the glow gradually weakened and finally disappeared.</p>
<p>An inorganic voice echoed in my head.</p>

<p><b>The calamity ── the Black Dragon of Extreme Destruction has been defeated. The temporary release of [Spirit Blessing] will be terminated.</b></p>

<p>At the same time, I fell to my knees on the spot. My whole body felt heavy. I couldn&#8217;t stand very well.</p>
<p>I wondered if it was a reaction to the fact that I had used more magic power than I could handle.</p>
<p>As I was breathing hard, the inorganic voice told me, &#8220;You are now level 91.&#8221;</p>
<p>My previous level was 72, so I&#8217;ve gone up 19 levels at once. This alone was a surprise, but there was more to the message.</p>


<p><b>First, Kou Kousaka is an extraordinary being and possesses [Creation].</b></p>
<p><b>Second, Kou Kousaka is over level 90.</b></p>
<p><b>Three, Kou Kousaka has experience in defeating a calamity.</b></p>
<p><b>Since all of the above conditions have been met, the [Calamity Summoning] will be unlocked!</b></p>

<p>Apparently, a new skill has been added.</p>
<p>The effect is to &#8220;summon and use a defeated calamity.&#8221;</p>
<p>I had just defeated the Black Dragon, so of course, it was included in the summoning option.</p>
<p>Should I give it a try?</p>
<p>No, let&#8217;s do it another time.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m at my limit physically and mentally, and I have higher priorities. I wonder if Iris is safe.</p>
<p>I stored Gram in my <b>[Item Box]</b> and looked behind me.</p>
<p>Iris was lying some distance away.</p>
<p>She was lying on her back, completely unconscious.</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Iris?&#8221;</p>
<p>I start to stagger along, dragging my legs, which have become heavy with fatigue.</p>
<p>I wonder if Iris is okay?</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not the heat rays that hit her directly, but she was flung away in the aftermath from the breakdown of the protective wall.</p>
<p>She probably just fainted because she used her magic to the limit. Maybe.</p>
<p>&#8230;Please let it be so.</p>
<p>However, I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>I kneel down beside Iris and pick her up on her back.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iris, are you okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>I called out to her, but she didn&#8217;t answer. Her eyelids were still closed, and her face showed no signs of blood.</p>
<p>&#8220;Iris?&#8221;</p>
<p>I shook her shoulders and activated my <b>[Appraisal]</b>.</p>
<p>Her status was listed as &#8220;abnormal condition: lack of magic power, serious illness.&#8221;</p>
<p>It says that she is in serious condition, but is her life in danger?</p>
<p>As I thought that, the<b> [Full Assist]</b> activated, and I heard a more detailed explanation.</p>

<p><b>Irisnote Fafnir is suffering from a serious lack of magic power.</b></p>
<p><b>If it continues like this, it may interfere with life support.</b></p>
<p><b>Do you wish to transfer your magic power?</b></p>

<p>Of course. Do it right away. I can&#8217;t lose Iris after we&#8217;ve defeated the Black Dragon.</p>

<p><b>Then transfer the magic power. Three, two, one&#8230;</b></p>
<p><b>Zero.</b></p>

<p>For a moment, I felt as if something warm was slipping out of my body.</p>
<p>When I used the <b>[Appraisal]</b> again, I found that the &#8220;abnormal condition&#8221; was removed from Iris&#8217;s status.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kou&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>Eventually, Iris slowly woke up.</p>
<p>&#8220;What happened to the Black Dragon&#8230;?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I defeated it. It&#8217;s okay now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I see, that&#8217;s good&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>Iris sighed in relief, then looked up at me and said.</p>
<p>&#8220;The reason I fainted was probably because I was running out of magic.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yeah. How did you know?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The last time I put up the barrier, I felt a thread snap inside me. &#8230;I was in a very dangerous situation, wasn&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;Yes.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know the details, but Kou helped me, right? Thank you. I owe you again, don&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry about it. Iris is an important friend for me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;An important friend, huh?&#8221;</p>
<p>Iris smiled happily.</p>
<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a little embarrassing, but it&#8217;s not a bad feeling.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;&#8230;I see.&#8221;</p>
<p>I gave a short response and turned my gaze upwards.</p>
<p>The sun had already set, and the sky was turning indigo. The night will soon arrive.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to stay out in the open like this, but I don&#8217;t think Iris and I are going to be able to move.</p>
<p>I wonder what we should do now.</p>
<p>Will I be able to recover my strength if I drink a lot of Heal Potion?</p>
<p>When I was about to open my <b>[Item Box]</b>, the sound of footsteps echoed, and a large object approached us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Master! You&#8217;re safe! Thank goodness, thank goodness!&#8221;</p>
<p>It was the Destroyer Golem.</p>
<p>As soon as he found us, he ran up to us, waving his right hand in the air.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve annihilated the monster, mission accomplished. Ehe.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you. You&#8217;ve done well.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Congratulations, Master, on defeating the Black Dragon! &#8230;Are you returning to the underground city?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. That&#8217;s the plan.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, then by all means.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Destroyer Golem crouched down on the spot and reached out his both hands.</p>
<p>&#8220;Please don&#8217;t hesitate to get on board. I guarantee you a comfortable journey.&#8221;</p>
<p>The Destroyer Golem&#8217;s hands were just big enough for one person to sit in.</p>
<p>I sat on the left, and Iris sat on the right.</p>
<p>&#8220;Then, we&#8217;re off!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Destroyer Golem began to walk slowly.</p>
<p>Of course, it shook, but the rhythm was constant and comfortable. It was the same feeling I get when sitting on a train seat.</p>
<p>I looked to my right and saw that Iris had fallen asleep before I knew it.</p>
<p>My consciousness was gradually fading, and I was also falling into a deep sleep.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;Where am I?&#8221;</p>
<p>The next thing I knew, I was floating in the darkness.</p>
<p>I was supposed to have been riding on the left hand side of the Destroyer Golem a while ago, but what the hell happened?</p>
<p>&#8230;Somehow, I feel like I&#8217;ve been in a similar situation before.</p>
<p>As I was thinking about this, a semi-transparent panel suddenly appeared in front of me.</p>
<p>It looked like a message window from a game, but what was displayed there was no text but images.</p>
<p>It was an event that happened four thousand years ago.</p>
<p>Black Dragon was destroying the city one after another, and the people who survived were building an underground city.</p>
<p>Once the underground city was completed, the ancient people began a huge ritual.</p>
<p>A magic circle over a hundred meters in diameter was drawn on the ground, and hundreds, if not thousands of people prayed within it.</p>
<p>The ritual continued for three days and three nights, and finally, the magic circle was activated.</p>
<p>One by one, the ancient people turned into golden particles, and finally, there was no one left.</p>
<p>What on earth had happened?</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know for sure, but I can guess.</p>
<p>The golden particles ── I saw them when I used the <b>[Spirit Blessing]</b>.</p>
<p>The ancient people involved in constructing the underground city may have been turned into spirits through a ritual.</p>
<p>For what purpose?</p>
<p>Perhaps to lend their power to the <b>[Transmigrator]</b> who will appear in the distant future.</p>
<p>When I came to that conclusion, the video ended, and a text was displayed instead.</p>

<p><i>──We would like to express our utmost gratitude to you for fulfilling our long-cherished wish of 4,000 years.</i></p>
 
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>&#8220;Master, wake up. Master.&#8221;</p>
<p>The voice of the Destroyer Golem woke me up.</p>
<p>It was deep in the Cello Forest, in front of the entrance to the underground city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kou, are you okay?&#8221;</p>
<p>It seemed that Iris had woken up first and was standing in front of the door that led to the underground city.</p>
<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I fell asleep for a moment.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s understandable. It was such a fierce battle.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;ll sleep better today.&#8221;</p>
<p>I jumped off the left side of the Destroyer Golem.</p>
<p>&#8220;Thank you for carrying me.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome. Do you have any other orders?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Well&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>I thought about it for a while and then decided to send the Destroyer Golem to the city of Aunen.</p>
<p>All the inhabitants had been evacuated to the underground city, so naturally, the city was empty.</p>
<p>If monsters or bandits were to target it, it would be a disaster, and a guard should be provided.</p>
<p>&#8220;I understand! I&#8217;ll do my best to protect the city!&#8221;</p>
<p>The Destroyer Golem saluted and headed towards Aunen with a vigorous gait.</p>
<p>The back looked big and reliable.</p>
<p>I know he&#8217;ll do well.</p>

<p>When the two of us returned to the underground city, we found Milia standing at the entrance to the city.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kou-san! Iris-san!&#8221;</p>
<p>She looked like she was about to burst into tears as she rushed towards us.</p>
<p>&#8220;A-are you okay? Are you hurt? I was really worried&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re fine. Don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Uuu, I&#8217;m so glad. I wondered what I would do if the two of you didn&#8217;t come back&#8230; Huuu.&#8221;</p>
<p>It seems that she was overwhelmed with emotion, and tears began to fall from her eyes.</p>
<p>Eventually, she began to cry out loudly.</p>
<p>I think this is the first time she&#8217;s shown this much emotion.</p>
<p>&#8220;You were really worried about us, weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>Iris smiled and hugged Milia.</p>
<p>They are like two sisters who are very close.</p>
<p>It was about ten minutes before Milia stopped crying.</p>
<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; I was so overwhelmed&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>When I was about to say, &#8220;That&#8217;s fine.&#8221;</p>
<p>There were dozens of translucent, round creatures rushing towards me at once from the city.</p>
<p>It was a horde of Helper Slimes. They stopped moving around me and bowed a bit vertically.</p>
<p>&#8220;Welcome back, Master-san!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;You defeated the Black Dragon, didn&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Yay, yay, yay!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Our master is..♪&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Strong, strong, strong, strong♪&#8221;</p>
<p>The Helper Slimes swayed from side to side, and for some reason, they began to sing a chorus. They were singing a song in praise of me.</p>
<p>To be honest, I was really embarrassed.</p>
<p>As I looked away in embarrassment, I saw Chief Zitan some distance away.</p>
<p>He waited for the Slimes to finish their chorus and then slowly approached us.</p>
<p>&#8220;Kou-kun, Iris-kun, thank you for your hard work. &#8230;What happened on the surface?&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;The Great Flood and the Black Dragon have been eliminated. The crisis should be over now.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Oh&#8230;! That&#8217;s great. Thank you. I really thank you.&#8221;</p>
<p>Chief Zitan smiled happily and asked us to shake his hand.</p>
<p>After we shook hands, I gave him a brief explanation of what I had done since I left the underground city.</p>
<p>After listening to everything, he nodded deeply and replied.</p>
<p>&#8220;Without you, the city would have been destroyed, and no one would have survived. I thank you from the bottom of my heart. &#8230;I&#8217;ll be sure to report this to the lord, and he&#8217;ll give you the honor and reward you deserve. You can look forward to it.&#8221;</p>
