<h3>Extra Chapter &#8211; Gaiden Princess Story</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Grandfather! Shouldn&#39;t we eat together?&quot;</p>   <p>A 5-year-old girl told an old man. Sharp eyes on the gray hair head. An old man full of charisma even for ages over 60. Grabbing the hem of the old man&#39;s trousers, the people around them were terrified by the whine of the girl, without knowing what to do.</p>   <p>&quot;Yuai, are you still whining like that? You are no longer a child. Will the guy who has to take over my house do such childish forever?&quot;</p>   <p>The old man shook his child&#39;s little hand and left the garden with his secretary without any eyes. She was refused coldly and looked away behind her and told a housekeeper next to her.</p>   <p>&quot;So, shouldn&#39;t my aunt eat me with me?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;How do you like me with a noble lady like a lady? Don&#39;t say that. Have lunch early. There will be classes in the afternoon. I will. &quot;</p>   <p>&quot;all right.&quot;</p>   <p>The girl noticed that she couldn&#39;t help her anymore, and went into the house with a shy expression. Eating rice alone on this large table wasn&#39;t too boring. A busy grandfather doesn&#39;t do anything at all. The nurses, guards, and butlers were all nervous about her, not even talking to her. The answer is the same no matter what you say. They were like utility poles.</p>   <p>The next day, she had to be sentenced to the same day again to her grandfather, who had to be confined to her room all day and punished by reflecting on the wall. She was never asking her for love since that day, because she was so scared of her angry grandfather&#39;s face.</p><p><script src=/d/js/ad/ad01.js></script></p>   <p>I even noticed in a dark room. After all, this world is alone.</p>   <p>After 13 years, I became a second-year high school student. She thought she didn&#39;t need to go to high school. However, her grandfather was concerned about the world. It was out-of-the-box theory that the granddaughter who took over the house did not even attend college. I tried to go to high school, but I didn&#39;t have anything to learn at school.</p>   <p>Rather than spending time at school, they have more often handled the work of the political and financial community on behalf of their grandfather. I forced him to go to school and began to push a lot of work.</p>   <p>That day my grandfather saw his cool skills and smiled happily. Since then. She was frustrated just thinking about it.</p>   <p>My grandfather wanted to somehow save what he had accomplished in the world. I was struck by the idea that I was just a grandfather&#39;s obsession. Of course, he gave me everything because he was the only relative. That is this great power.</p>   <p>A desire that anyone wants to get somehow.</p>   <p>When I was about 10 years old, I noticed that the world would move as I wanted. It was fun to annoy the adults who bothered me. Of course, I got tired right away.</p>   <p>And when I was a junior high school student, I was able to move assets and get everything I wanted. In addition, her innate ability to read clarity and the flow of money was enough to increase her home assets. In the election, he visited himself rather than his grandfather, and was asked to support him with his head lowered deeply. They were politicians who listened attentively to their weaknesses, being tamed and tamed. These poor people couldn&#39;t let go of their power, even though they knew they would be more oppressed with the investment. And the foundation was hers little by little. It was already natural for her to be true. In this high school she was also called a young lady and was a subject of fear. She couldn&#39;t control the feelings she woke up only for today, and she stuck her schoolboy in the front seat with a mechanical pencil.</p>   <p>&quot;How did you ...?&quot;</p>   <p>Despite her classmates, she honors her. She said with a smile on her face, whispering. He always didn&#39;t care, but today was different. Unlike the smiling expression, the words coming out of the mouth were very horrible.</p>   <p>&quot;Too boring, you, jump out of the window, and it might be fun.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;e?&quot;</p>   <p>The schoolboy fell down on her words. Last week, I came to mind the fact that a student in the next class against her had not yet come to school. Probably not for a lifetime.</p>   <p>&quot;But this is on the fourth floor.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;So you hate it?&quot;</p>   <p>The boys couldn&#39;t jump off, and they started crying because they didn&#39;t hate them. She was afraid, but she did not expect to be sentenced to death like this.</p>   <p>&quot;I can&#39;t help crying. Decide. How do you jump off?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Well, at least let me do something that doesn&#39;t die ...&quot;</p>   <p>She hated seeing her crying in front of her. For some reason, it&#39;s no use talking.</p><p>&quot;You transfer to tomorrow. If you see me again, it&#39;s not free.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Huh ...&quot;</p>   <p>The boy shook his body. He is also a powerful son. But she didn&#39;t compare to her. Her parents have also warned her not to hurt her. However, it is possible to look like this. Schoolboys are going to be black in the future. She stood up from the desk, leaving him boring. I thought I couldn&#39;t understand why the lunch break was so long and tried to get out of the classroom.</p>   <p>A group of influential girls, her followers and classmates, followed her behind. Of course, she is still the youngest lady among them.</p>   <p>&quot;Daughter, did he offend you? Immediately show him ...&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Daddy. You&#39;re boring.&quot;</p>   <p>She gestured not to follow. Then he went to the schoolyard and sat down. Then, the students who sat down and exchanged stories got up one after another and went away. It was usual. When I was in elementary school, I realized that I couldn&#39;t make friends. In elementary school, there was a girl who thought she was close. However, his family was destroyed by his grandfather. The day she was swearing at her, she decided she wouldn&#39;t make friends again.</p>   <p>Of course, no one approached her to make a friend.</p>   <p>&quot;It&#39;s boring ...&quot;</p>   <p>Even as a high school student, no one was eating together. I no longer had lunch at school. The guards said they would prepare meals, so they used the school facilities on their own and were troublesome.</p>   <p>Getting everything doesn&#39;t do anything. Nobody eats together.</p>   <p>I went to the back of the schoolyard because I was so bored sitting. There were schoolboys around them. In addition to cigarettes, they had recently beaten the occipital region of a boy student who had begun targeting bullying.</p>   <p>They began to retreat as she approached. Why did you show up here? With the face.</p>   <p>&quot;Is it delicious? I want to smoke too.&quot;</p>   <p>She suddenly noticed the taste of the cigarettes they were holding.</p>   <p>&quot;Huh ...? Are you smoking?&quot;</p>   <p>One of the bullying schoolboys was holding down the shoulders of a schoolboy, who took the cigarette out of his pocket and gave it to her. She said it in her mouth.</p>   <p>&quot;Fire, please.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Oh, yes!&quot;</p>   <p>Lighting her with a lighter, she smoked, but began to cough badly.</p>   <p>&quot;Ge, Geho ... Geho ...&quot;</p>   <p>What&#39;s this. I got angry and pressed a lit cigarette against the arm of the student they were bullying, and extinguished it.</p>   <p>&quot;Vow oh oh ...&quot;</p>   <p>Naturally, a scream rang. However, she looked innocent. Reaction that it is very boring. An ordinary scream. It was just boring. Throw the erased tobacco. Other students looked at the figure vaguely. Although they were bullying, they at least did not treat them ashtrays. At least you think you were a human being.</p>   <p>&quot;Over there.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Yesâ€¦?&quot;</p>   <p>The students, who were even more afraid of her, matched their gazes with care.</p>   <p>&quot;Can you rape me?&quot;</p><p>&quot;Hello?&quot;</p>   <p>When the impossible word popped out, everyone, even the bullied student, stepped back.</p>   <p>&quot;Yeah, you guys are there. The reaction you expected.</p>   <p>She said she returned to school. The boys lost their soul and just watched it. She went up to the rooftop. Looking down under the school. In the school where the lunch break was not over, there were many students gathering around here and there.</p>   <p>You can do everything in this school as you wish. Yes, like a queen. But she sighed why all this was so boring. And I decided at this time. I have to go to college to go there. All you have to do is attend on your behalf and get your diploma on your behalf. In such a boring place, I want to finish high school last.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>

<p>As such, she graduated in the simplicity of change. From this point on she lost interest in the daytime world. I didn&#39;t like seeing good-looking people. Uninteresting. Rather, the night town felt easier. I felt like the city at night was like me.</p>   <p>When I worked with politicians and corporate chairmen on a number of injustices, for some reason I was frustrated for no reason and came to the city at night. However, it became troublesome to choose and wear clothes at a certain time, and it became troublesome to decorate. Nobody wanted to show himself well.</p>   <p>So the shabby head and easy-to-wear hoodie became like a night city uniform. It was a daily routine to walk alone in such clothes. Of course, there were guards hiding everywhere, but she had been treating them as a utility pole since she was young, so she was almost absent.</p>   <p>However, unusually that day, a middle-aged man approached her. Seeing her wandering around the city at night, she thought she was a runaway woman.</p>   <p>&quot;Did you leave home? Just look at it. You don&#39;t do it with your uncle. You need money. I&#39;ll give you enough money.</p>   <p>Promptly invited prostitution. This was my first time. Curious, she followed the man and entered the love hotel.</p>   <p>&quot;Do you want to shower?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Disagreeable&quot;</p>   <p>She replied shortly. The man shrugged and began taking off his clothes. An obscene body is exposed. Nevertheless, the towering ones casually stimulated her curiosity. This was my first time seeing a man hit. I wasn&#39;t particularly interested, but it looked interesting.</p>   <p>I bought a passing woman, and it seemed like her grandfather&#39;s appearance was like a lump of lust shaking. My grandfather is like the desire itself.</p><p><script src=/d/js/ad/ad01.js></script></p>   <p>A middle-aged man who thought he was not the first time to take off all his clothes but was not ashamed to see it, suddenly approached and began taking off her clothes. She was still standing. Somehow, it seemed interesting to be deprived of my virgin.</p>   <p>&quot;Fufufufufu.&quot;</p>   <p>It&#39;s getting a little more fun. Knowing the fact that such a man had taken her virgin, I could imagine what would happen to her grandfather&#39;s face. It was a funny face too. When the man took off her hoodie, a chest appeared to overflow from his bra. However, the man suddenly frowned.</p>   <p>&quot;You ... that ...&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Yup?&quot;</p>   <p>In front of the man&#39;s gaze was a scar on his arm. I saw the man who saw it suddenly get smaller. This was a wound when she was young, and once she had burned her arm, she was wondering how her grandfather would react and self-harming herself. Grotesque shrunken skin gave me the feeling of being alive, so I did not intentionally erase the scars.</p>   <p>&quot;Woman, who sees such an ugly body and who has sex. And even money.</p>   <p>Then the man began to dress again. She was upset. Scars make your desires fade? Really, human beings are selfish creatures. If this man had committed himself and had given him the real feeling of being alive by hitting his body, he might have lived home. Until now, I really thought so. Because it was before I understood the dirt of the desire of a creature called a man.</p>   <p>However, a man who has stomped on such a decision without permission. She just had to endure. Make the shape of a gun with your hands. He took it to the forehead of a dressed man with a blur and imitated shooting a gun.</p>   <p>&quot;Uncle, do you have a home?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Eh? Of course?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Yes ...?</p>   <p>She smiled and left Loveho&#39;s room. Of course, the man lived and never left the room. The shape of the gun was a kind of signal. Once you have the shape of a gun, get ready. And to imitate shooting a gun was an implicit signal that the trigger could be triggered.</p>   <p>It was unusual to use this signal. No matter how much she enjoys murder. But I didn&#39;t show any mercy to those who really offended me. In that respect, I thought he was like a grandfather.</p>   <p>&quot;It&#39;s boring ...&quot;</p>   <p>She has now gone out of Love Ho, dumping the lines that have become habitual. Since then, she went out into the city at night if she was really annoyed, looking for someone who could invite her. Sometimes I invited herself. That&#39;s how she played a little missing woman. It was a bit interesting to see her being sorrowful. And the scars were made bigger for a dramatic effect. Of course, it was not a self-injury like when I was young, but a scar I drew.</p>   <p>Every time the men saw the scars, the reaction was interesting. She managed to get a bit bored by seeing the guys responding to one of the three always and relieving frustration. Of course, a tremendous emptiness came after that, but nevertheless, she continued to repeat this in a habit as frustration came.</p>   <p>One day, a politician who can be said to belong to the house brought a woman.</p>   <p>`` Teacher, who is that woman? &#39;&#39;</p><p>She sat in a reception room with a large tsubo and greeted guests and asked, looking at the woman she met for the first time.</p>   <p>&quot;I&#39;ve been taking care of a woman lately, but I&#39;ve made a pretty interesting drug. She says she wants to use it to create a social party, so she&#39;s asked for permission.&quot;</p>   <p>`` Social party? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>Recently, she responded with some interest because she began to take an interest in the desires of men. Then she noticed it and began talking carefully, kneeling down.</p>   <p>&quot;Um, I&#39;m Kimoto. I&#39;m honored to see you.</p>   <p>Even Akamine in the world was nervous with her words clogged in front of her.</p>   <p>&quot;I don&#39;t care about your referrals. Instead, talk about medicine.&quot;</p>   <p>The woman tried to introduce herself, but she immediately interrupted her words. The woman had to change the subject in a hurry.</p>   <p>&quot;Well, this medicine makes men lose their senses and devour only their desires. They can also collect donations under the name of social parties and seize their weaknesses. Once you get dyed, you won&#39;t be able to drink. &quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Yes, it looks interesting. So, can I drink it?&quot;</p>   <p>`` O, young lady? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>The politician got up from his seat with surprise. If that happens, it will be hard. The politician hurriedly signaled to the next woman, saying she was really offended by the uncanny curiosity she sometimes showed. Then, Zhu Feng spoke while sweating.</p>   <p>&quot;Well, it has no effect on women. When male hormones exceed a certain ratio, they are responsive ...&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;I wanted to know what the sense of losing reason was, but it&#39;s not interesting.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot;</p>   <p>However, he also became interested in the appearance of a man losing reason. I wanted to see it once. A world where men who lose their desire just to see scars lose their reason and devour women all night.</p>   <p>&quot;Well, okay.</p>   <p>&quot;Huh? Yes! Thank you!&quot;</p>   <p>The woman replied, unable to see her face properly. She gestured. It meant going down.</p>   <p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry. Thank you again.&quot;</p>   <p>As she left, she spoke to a politician wiping her forehead with a handkerchief, as if she had thought of shortening her life.</p>   <p>&quot;Teacher, you shouldn&#39;t be too close to that woman.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;e?&quot;</p>   <p>The politician couldn&#39;t understand what it was, and heard her back. However, he closed his mouth immediately.</p>   <p>&quot;I know you&#39;re the slowest, hater, right?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;But ...&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Somehow it doesn&#39;t smell very good. It&#39;s very sensitive to the smell that makes money, but she&#39;s not good. It probably feels like she&#39;s reaching out to other politicians. Is it a foot? &quot;</p>   <p>She got up from her seat while saying so. She was interested in a social party, but that woman had no fun at all. A type of reaction, a type of ambition. Too openly visible. She left the reception room, leaving a politician shaking his head and giving a troubled look.</p><p>A few months later, she quarreled with her grandfather for the first time. To be honest, it was my first time eating. However, he was so terrified that he was given words that he could not stand. Of course, my grandfather took care of her. Yes, physically. I admit it. However, she had never been given affection.</p>   <p>No one has shown her affection to her, not just her grandfather. When I was thinking about that, I started feeling unpleasant and came out of town. Before being boring, I was too upset. Unless someone hit this, it was unlikely to be endurable.</p>   <p>As I&#39;ve done many times, I decided to seduce and try and kill a man. I&#39;ve stopped doing that recently as things have become empty. But today I can&#39;t stand upset anger.</p>   <p>I ran a car and stopped it in a city I didn&#39;t even know. And we got out of town. It was troublesome to walk around one by one, and headed to a nearby stop. Stops always stop people. And let me wait. In doing so, most men naturally look at the woman. As usual, today, I stuck my cheek while expecting such a man to appear. Endlessly flowing without time was As usual boring.</p>
