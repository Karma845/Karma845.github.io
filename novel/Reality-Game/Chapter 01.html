<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; The Woman Next Door</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.1</strong></p>

<p>Hmm…?</p>



<p>As soon as I woke up… A window popped up in my field of vision. Something like a Windows folder icon. The sense of incongruity before my eyes gave me the illusion of still wandering in a dream.</p>



<p>However, this wasn’t a dream. The harsh reality was that I still felt pain after pinching my cheek. It was still just my usual room. Including the narrow bathroom that came with it, this place had no particular change.</p>



<p>If there was anything weird, it was this strange thing projecting itself in my vision. Thinking it was just an illusion, even after I got up and washed my face, it had no sign of disappearing.</p>



<p>Am I going crazy? Is it perhaps because I shut myself off for so long that something happened to my brain, to the point of even hallucinating? Is there something pressing onto my optic nerve?</p>



<p>At times like this, one must look it up. I got off my bed and pressed on the computer power button. But it didn’t turn on. Thinking there was some kind of hardware failure, I opened it up but there didn’t seem to be anything amiss. It was working just fine yesterday.</p>



<p>I was getting pretty annoyed, but somehow holding it in, I took out my cellphone. However, even that couldn’t connect to the internet.</p>


<p>How about this then? Placing the notebook that was left charging on the floor onto my lap, I pressed the power button.</p>



<p>The outcome was hopeless. This wasn’t booting up either.</p>



<p>How could both my computer and notebook malfunction simultaneously even though they were working fine till yesterday? Amidst the confusion as to what was what anymore, I double-tapped my cellphone screen that was held in my left hand. To check if I was the only one going through this, I dialed my friend’s number and waited. But that too, was interrupted. Cursing out loud, I haphazardly dialed an acquaintance’s number on the telephone. The result was the same. Furthermore, not even my parents were answering the call. For some reason, I couldn’t hear the phone ringing.</p>



<p>It appears that all of this has some kind of connection with the internet not working. It might even be the end of the world. Thinking so, I rushed outside but everything was perfectly ordinary. People were walking about just as usual.</p>



<p>Returning back, I sat down on the bed and faced reality. Just as before, the window flickered before my eyes. Ultimately, all of this boils down to being related to this thing. I wanted to be wrong but I could not avoid reality anymore.</p>

<p>I stared intently at the small window before me. There was no response no matter how much I glared at it. And so, I put my finger on it.</p>



<p>Once I did, surprisingly two messages popped up before my eyes, similar to how a computer window would appear. Words were engraved distinctly on these semi-transparent windows.</p>



<p>«Status» «Item»<br>«Save» «Load»</p>



<p>“…?”</p>



<p>The hell is this unrealistic scenario! Immediately the sense of realism disappeared. However, pinching myself once again and then slapping myself proved that this wasn’t a dream. The pain was directly transmitted to my brain.</p>



<p>It’s unrealistic but it’s reality? ‘Status’ and ‘Item’. And also ‘Save’ and ‘Load’. No matter how I look at it, those are things that come up in games.</p>



<p>I have no idea what’s going on, but I should understand once I press it, right? I put my finger on ‘Status’.</p>



<p>Immediately, the semi-transparent window changed to a different one.</p>



<p>Hasegawa Ryou<br>Age: 25 years<br>Occupation: NEET<br>Level: 1<br>Constitution: 55<br>Charm: 12<br>Savings: 5,010,130 Yen<br>EXP: 0</p>



<p>Upon that window was a listing of my personal information. ‘Age’ is 25. That’s correct information. However, I’m uncertain about this ‘Level’ or ‘Constitution’. However, ‘Savings’ was correct information. Although I’m a NEET, the 500,000 Yen I had earned through part-time jobs had turned into 5,000,000 Yen thanks to the bit of profit I made on stock shares.</p>


<p>Of course, it’s not like I racked up the money thanks to having some special talent in market shares. My in-game friend had graciously provided me with some information, so I thought of trying it out. That’s all.</p>



<p>And this entire amount was laid bare by this ‘Status Window’. As I thought, this is a game.</p>



<p>In that case, what about this ‘Save’ and ‘Load’? Touching the ‘Save’ button revealed a message.</p>



<p>«Would you like to save?»</p>



<p>Once I clicked save, a progress bar was displayed, under which was shown May 2, 10:30. Judging by how it looks, I only had one save slot. It seemed to be impossible to create several save points like other games.</p>



<p>I must utilize this carefully then. One untimely save could result in a dead end.</p>



<p>Anyhow, clicking ‘Load’ displayed a similar popup as ‘Save’ with May 2, 10:30 written.</p>



<p>«Would you like to load?»</p>



<p>Was what it asked. It’s 10:33 right now. As soon as I confirmed this, I clicked on this message. At any rate, experimentation was necessary. Once I did, my vision turned white and I returned to reality again. Hurriedly checking the clock, I saw exactly 10:30:22.</p>



<p>I had returned to the past. Precisely 3 minutes ago. It was true. I was really inside a game. Cold sweat poured down my forehead. With a mixture of excitement and astonishment, it was a feeling that I couldn’t properly express. Well isn’t this interesting, to have reality be turned into a game.</p>



<p>Since it’s a game, I presume I’d return to the real world once I clear it. At the very least, there should be some kind of reason for me to have entered the game. Taking that into consideration, I analyzed the game window once again more deeply.</p>



<p>Hasegawa Ryou<br>Age: 25 years<br>Occupation: NEET<br>Level: 1<br>Constitution: 55<br>Charm: 12<br>Savings: 4,910,130 Yen<br>EXP: 0</p>



<p>Like this, I thoroughly read over the ‘Status’ once again. There, my eyes froze at the part where my savings had decreased by 100,000 Yen. Does saving and loading also cost money? If not, then it shouldn’t have decreased. Well, it’s the ability to go back in time. It would be strange if there wasn’t any compensation at all for its use.</p>



<p>Coming to such an understanding, I turned my attention towards the other entries. Just what on earth does this ‘Level’ mean? Is the mechanics such where an increase in Level would increase my Constitution and Charm? If that’s the case, then of course my Level is 1 since I just entered the game. I have no idea what I have to do to level up, though. The game doesn’t even seem to have some kind of complicated manual either. I wonder where Constitution and Charm could be usable. The numbers are also unclear; 55, it says. My Level is 1, but Constitution 55. In that case, I bet 100 isn’t the highest value.</p>



<p>Like the majority of RPG games, EXP would of course be for leveling up. So if I gain EXP, my Level increases, and if my Level increases, my Constitution and Charm would increase. The more I look at it, the more it seems like a game. But that’s just it. Finding out anything more doesn’t seem to be possible.</p>


<p>Tossing that regret aside, I entered ‘Item’ this time. Here, two similarly transparent windows also appeared.</p>



<p>«Item Shop» «Owned Items»</p>



<p>Touching ‘Owned Items’, a message appeared.</p>



<p>«You currently have no items in possession.»</p>



<p>Well of course. Just what was I even expecting. Going back, I touched ‘Item Shop’ this time, upon which several such ‘Items’ appeared before me. Other than having levels themselves, the variety of items available would also increase as I level up. Such was an unspoken rule of video games.</p>



<p>«LV 1 Scouter: 100,000 Yen»<br>«Sleep Spray: 250,000 Yen»<br>«Master Key: 600,000 Yen»<br>«Camera 100,000 Yen»<br>«Imported Car: 50,000,000 Yen»<br>«Domestic Car: 8,000,000 Yen»</p>



<p>For the time being, I touched each of them to check them out, starting from the scouter at the top.</p>



<p>«Purchase LV 1 Scouter for 100,000 Yen?»</p>



<p>A message appeared inquiring about my intention to purchase it, without even providing any information about it. Just like the absence of a manual, it seems like even item related information isn’t given either. What an unfriendly game.</p>



<p>More importantly, why do these ‘items’ cost so much? I’m about to go dizzy with these earth shattering numbers! In particular, these ‘Imported Car’ and ‘Domestic Car’ cost just as much as a house! Just what kind of amazing abilities do these ‘items’ have? Of course, with the amount I currently have, actually buying them is just impossible.</p>



<p>Anyway, I thought I had to purchase something and see for myself, on just what kind of game I had gotten myself into. Thus, the ‘LV 1 Scouter’ came into view. It’s the most suitable candidate for a test run since it’s the cheapest. Although, I did have my share of complaints since even the cheapest item cost 100,000 Yen. Once I was done purchasing it, I touched ‘Owned Items’ again and saw ‘LV 1 Scouter’ added to the entries. And after clicking on it, lo and behold, a full detailed description kept appearing in succession!</p>



<p>«LV 1 Scouter»<br>«Once equipped, will reveal the capture information related to the targeted woman being gazed upon.»<br>«A higher level scouter will reveal more detailed information.»</p>



<p>Even though it didn’t give me a hint of information before buying it, once I did, it explained everything. The information about the ‘LV 1 Scouter’ basically threw clues related to the game at me.</p>



<p>«Reveal the capture information related to the targeted woman being gazed upon.»</p>



<p>Especially this part.</p>



<p>It gave me a very suggestive feeling. So basically, your objective in this game is to capture women? Uh, so… it’s genre is something like an eroge?</p>


<p><strong>1.2</strong></p>



<p>Just while I was thinking that, all my self-confidence suddenly vanished. That’s because I didn’t have the experience of frequently interacting with women. Capturing women in reality is a hurdle too high. These 12 Charm points are proof of my history without women.</p>



<p>To confirm my use of 100,000 Yen, I opened up the ‘Status Window’ once again.</p>



<p>Hasegawa Ryou<br>Age: 25 years<br>Occupation: NEET<br>Level: 1<br>Constitution: 55<br>Charm: 55<br>Savings: 4,810,130 Yen<br>EXP: 0</p>



<p>And indeed 100,000 had decreased. A game with precise calculation.</p>



<p>Incidentally, I thought of something. The only strange thing occurring regarding me entering this game is the ‘Game System’. That, and also the fact that I can’t connect to the net, nor contact any of my acquaintances. Apart from these, there wasn’t really any other variation from reality. Hence, I also felt hungry and the need to use the toilet.</p>



<p>If that’s the case, I have to eat something. I wonder if my savings would decrease if I bought something outside?</p>



<p>I had to test it out since food was the most important thing related to survival. Gabbing my wallet, I left home. Entering the nearest convenience store, I put this and that into a basket, paid with my card and carefully read the ‘Status Window’ after leaving the place.</p>



<p>Hasegawa Ryou<br>Age: 25 years<br>Occupation: NEET<br>Level: 1<br>Constitution: 55<br>Charm: 55<br>Savings: 4,808,930 Yen<br>EXP: 0</p>



<p>Precisely 1200 Yen had been drawn away. This meant that my savings will not just decrease when I purchase ‘Items’ but for everything that can possibly be bought with money. Perhaps the only saving grace was that the stuff I bought from the convenience store actually cost the same as reality, in contrast to the vastly expensive ‘Items’. Thanks to this, I shouldn’t have any problems being able to eat and live for the time being.</p>




<p>As long as I don’t buy an item that’s too expensive, I shouldn’t starve to death. Only, the key lies in the method for increasing my savings. But since I can’t connect to the internet, anything related to that is out. I can’t do part-time nor full-time jobs either.</p>



<p>If I do a job, then I won’t have time to progress in the game. And this is just a passing thought but, I don’t think the game will permit any action that would let me break out of it. It doesn’t seem like I’ll be able to solve the money issue at the moment.&nbsp; For the time being, I put away my worries and tested out the scouter since I was already outside.</p>



<p>«Would you like to equip the Scouter?»</p>



<p>Touching the equip button on the Owned Items section, this window had appeared once again. I was getting quite annoyed at this troublesome thing. If I was at my computer, I would put my complaints about this level of interface up on a bulletin board. Tilting my head over, I looked at the woman at the store counter through the scouter.</p>



<p>Masaki Arina<br>Age: 21 years<br>Relationship Status: Dating<br>Capture Difficulty: C<br>Occupation: University Student<br>Residence: Inaccessible at current level<br>Telephone Number: Inaccessible at current level<br>Capture Information: Inaccessible at current level</p>


<p>The given information wasn’t anything special. Just her name and that she has a boyfriend; and apart from her age, there wasn’t anything in particular to take notice of. In other words, capture was impossible. More importantly, just what are the capture requirements? Is it considered a capture if I start dating her? The amount of information I lack is too much!</p>



<p>Rather, while my suspicions kept rising, I tottered back home. On the way, I suddenly encountered the woman from the next door apartment. I would normally take out the trash during this time, so she’s someone I see quite often. She’s always home the entire day, so perhaps she could be a NEET like me or might even work night shifts.</p>



<p>The reason for why I’m aware of such details is because I found it quite sexy how her long hair was let down just below her shoulders and how plump her lips were, so my eyes would subconsciously tend to look towards her. Her retreating figure back to her apartment after she was done with trash disposal made my heart throb.</p>



<p>In that case, can I capture this woman? Instinctively thinking so, I quickly summoned my ‘Item’.</p>



<p>«Would you like to equip LV 1 Scouter?»</p>



<p>I hurriedly selected «LV 1 Scouter» and looked at her just as she was about to board the elevator.</p>



<p>Sakurai Ami<br>Age: 30 years<br>Relationship Status: Married<br>Capture Difficulty: E<br>Occupation: Housewife<br>Residence: Inaccessible at current level<br>Telephone Number: Inaccessible at current level<br>Capture Information: 30 year old housewife. Not getting along with her husband. Likes to visit clubs keeping her husband in the dark. Has no children. Has many illicit love affairs.</p>



<p>The information that turned up was a series of surprises. Firstly, her age startled me. Although it showed me her age, I did expect her to be in her late twenties, but to think she was in her thirties. Moreover, she’s a housewife, huh. I didn’t even think she was married since she wasn’t wearing a ring. I was reminded of the age old saying that people don’t match their appearances.</p>



<p>Sakurai’s looks and style were considerably above the woman working part-time in the convenience store. However, unlike the convenience store woman, her capture information showed up in the scouter. In other words, the capture information that’s shown has nothing to do with their looks or style. Judging whether someone can be captured or not based on their looks seems useless.</p>



<p>Well, that’s fine. Confirmed by the ‘Scouter,’ it seems like it shouldn’t be that difficult to approach a woman whose capture information has been revealed. Moreover, if the difficulty is E then it’s likely that it can be challenged even at Level 1. However, the problem is the capture method. It’s fine that the capture information was revealed, but I don’t understand how exactly I should utilize this information. Smooth talk? A woman like that? No matter how amorous she is, the hurdle is too high for me. Even so, as long as I challenge it with something, clues related to the capture method should reveal itself. Nothing will be settled if I just sit around.</p>

<p>However, it’s easier said than done. Since I had absolutely no idea on how to use what, I temporarily retreated back to my house. I’ll fail if I thoughtlessly make advances on her.</p>



<p>What was obvious was that capture was impossible without the use of any items. It seems difficult to approach using only my own skills. That’s where the meaning behind the ‘Items’’ existence arose.</p>



<p>The ‘Items’ had of course appeared for the sake of capturing. There are certainly some tactical items among them too. However, if I fear that and hesitate in purchasing said ‘Items’ then I really won’t be able to do anything.</p>



<p>In the end, the only thing I can rely on are the ‘Items’. I even got to know that this game’s objective was to capture women thanks to the ‘LV 1 Scouter’. If that’s the case, the other ‘Items’ should also lead me to some kind of clues. I put my finger on ‘Item Shop’.</p>



<p>For the time being, I intend to purchase all the ‘Items’ in the list. Of course that’s excluding the ‘Imported Car’ and ‘Domestic Car’. I can’t buy them even if I wanted to. Whatever the case, my shopping list was ‘Sleep Spray,’ ‘Master Key’ and ‘Camera’.</p>



<p>With the purpose of buying them all out, I moved my finger across them. Since it was involving money that nobody could trifle with, my finger trembled as it moved across the ‘Game Window’. Even so, I forced it through the act.</p>



<p>The transaction completed immediately. Probably about 900,000 Yen had just disappeared in an instant.</p>



<p>After purchasing, I noticed that neither of them had any physical substance like that of ‘LV 1 Scouter’. The sense of reality ceaselessly dropped. The very existence of ‘Items’ itself was very unrealistic, though.</p>



<p>In any case, the purchase was complete. Now it’s confirmation time. I entered ‘Owned Items’. And there appeared the entries of the newly added ‘Sleep Spray,’ ‘Master Key’ and ‘Camera’. With a mixture of worry and expectation, I operated the window once again, revealing detailed information about each ‘Item’.</p>



<p>«Sleep Spray»<br>«Just as the name implies, a sleep spray. Boasts incredible performance.»<br>«After touching the item window, simply staring at the target is sufficient.»<br>«Effect Duration: 1 hour»<br>«Area of Effect: 1 meter»</p>


<p>«Master Key»<br>«Has the ability to open absolutely any kind of door.»<br>«Can be used by touching the window after standing in front of the desired door.»<br>«Usage Limit: 6 times»<br>-Repurchasing will not change this limit.<br>-Limit restoration is possible if repurchased after level up.</p>



<p>«Camera»<br>«X-Ray Camera. Able to take pictures of anything.»<br>«To use, placing the desired frame is your field of vision, and then blinking is sufficient.»<br>«Usage Limit: 3 times»</p>



<p>‘Sleep Spray’ and ‘Master Key’ are exactly what their names sound like. The ‘Camera’ is also what it sounds like, but I never even imagined that it would have an X-Ray vision function. Thanks to this, I might even say I profited a bit here. Although, I stopped right there since the ‘Master Key’ and ‘Camera’ had a limited number of usage.</p>



<p>Anyways, there’s no way these items would actually exist! Suddenly, curiosity titillated my mind.</p>



<p>I can intrude using the ‘Master Key’ and put people to sleep using the ‘Sleep Spray’. Well doesn’t this seem interesting! Since these items had appeared for these very purposes, my mind became occupied with such thoughts. In other words, capturing women means to have sex with them?</p>



<p>Ba-dump! Ba-dump!</p>



<p>The thought of completely turning over my life without having any relationships with women on its head made my heart throb wildly. No matter how I thought about it, the reason for the existence of these ‘Items’ must be for the lascivious thoughts that keep floating about in my head right now.</p>



<p>If that’s really the case, this is a <em>terrific</em> game!</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.3</strong></p>


<p>I ended up wanting to confirm it. It was necessary to verify whether or not my thoughts were on the mark. I needed something to tinker around with the capture conditions, so this wasn’t a wrong train of thought. Giving myself this excuse, I gulped down the saliva that drooled out alongside the immoral feelings that ceaselessly escalated.</p>



<p>Right after that, I ran towards her house. Even while being aware that this was a crime, I didn’t care about ethics or morals in this fantasy that had created such ‘Items,’ and my body kept moving as if it was possessed by something. Her address didn’t show up in the ‘Scouter,’ but it doesn’t matter. Because I already knew where she lived from the very beginning.</p>



<p>I hurriedly climbed up the stairs. Running across the hallway, I reached the entrance to her home. I called upon the ‘Item’ as I stood in front of the door.</p>



<p>«Would you like to use the Master Key?»</p>



<p>The message appeared before me as soon as I did. My hands were unduly trembling. This wasn’t half baked nervousness. The fact that it was something I had no choice but to do made me agitated. As if there was a demon standing right behind me.</p>



<p>As soon as I touched the message, the window disappeared. There wasn’t any change that stood out. I grasped the doorknob and tried opening the door. Consequently, it opened without a shred of resistance, letting me enter the house. And thus I walked, carrying myself with ninja-like footsteps. Even forgetting to take off my shoes, I infiltrated the house. Feeling the presence of a person, Sakurai, who was watching television, looked towards me, and our gazes met immediately.</p>



<p>— Kyaaa!</p>



<p>Her shriek that was loud enough that I felt my eardrums would rip at any time, reverberated everywhere. She tried to avoid and escape away from me. Throwing her TV remote she had at me, she faced the kitchen and ran. Seeing her like that, I panicked and ended up leaping towards her, and called upon my ‘Item’.</p>



<p>“A robbeeeeer!”</p

<p>An ‘Item’ did not appear before her who screamed at the top of her lungs. Suddenly, I felt something unusual about my body. I couldn’t seem to move it on my own. My field of vision also turned white. Time seemed to have stopped. Of course, Sakurai’s movements had also stopped.</p>



<p>What on earth is this situation! I was considerably flustered. While I was thinking about it, what appeared before my eyes were two option windows.</p>



<p>«Choice 1: Explain that you’re not a robber and calm her down.»<br />«Choice 2: Use Sleep Spray»</p>



<p>There were only two choices. After these strange choice windows appeared, my arm was the only thing I could move. I could understand it telling me to select one of these two choices. In that case, there’s no need to be worried. In any case, the first choice is an impossibility. Would there even be someone who’d calmly listen to what their intruder has to say?</p>



<p>That’s why I brought my finger towards number 2, after which, the frozen world immediately started to move again. It was then that the ‘Item’ in question appeared before me.</p>


<p>«Would you like to use the Sleep Spray?»</p>



<p>I stared at her after touching the window. Accordingly, Sakurai’s eyes closed and she collapsed right there. Once I hastily went towards her and put my ear near her face, I could hear the sound of her regular breathing. I’d be correct to say that she had fallen asleep.</p>



<p>She was sleeping soundly. As I saw her like that, my lust suddenly burst out. It was only the two of us in this house. A situation where she won’t be waking up in an hour. Once again, I was tormented by the throbbing in my chest.</p>



<p>Hotpants and a T-shirt. Seeing her rough, casual attire, my eyes naturally turned towards her buttocks. Saliva was gulped down. There’s a completely defenseless girl in front of my eyes. I could hear the devil’s whisper telling me to touch her plump butt and protruding breasts. </p>



<p>Me coming here was so that I could confirm whether the act between men and women was the condition for capture. If so, then there shouldn’t be any reason to hesitate. The game must be wishing for me to do this!</p>



<p>As I rationalized my actions like this, suddenly, the world froze once again. White windows appeared, and there lay 2 choices.</p>



<p>«Choice 1: Assault her just like this.»<br />«Choice 2: I am a gentleman. I’ll stop here and check around her house.»</p>



<p>At that instant, the second option didn’t even register in me. My finger was already making its way towards the first option by reflex. And then I touched it. The world filled with white light disappeared, and my body regained its freedom.</p>



<p>Just as the option spelt out, I straddled her body. But that moment, something odd happened. A group of policemen rushed through the entranceway. With a face of one whose soul seemed to have left, I simply kept blinking.</p>



<p>“Don’t move! You are arrested under the charges of rape and robbery! You have the right to…”</p



<p>The policeman in front raised his voice and sorted out the situation in a matter of seconds. I got caught red-handed and arrested. Putting handcuffs on me, I got turned into a criminal and was thrown into the rear seat of their patrol car just like that.</p>



<p>I don’t know if sex is the capture condition or not. However, I strongly understood that forced assault was an unforgivable act. I sighed at the fact that I got arrested for the first time in my life.</p>



<p>At any rate, this is a no-go. I moved my finger and clicked on ‘Load’.</p>



<p>«Would you like to load?»</p>



<p>The world turned white once again and I was back to my home where I had last clicked ‘Save’. At 10:30:22. If I hadn’t saved before the experiment, then I wouldn’t have any loading point, and wouldn’t have had any other choice but to get taken away to the police station. I trembled at the thought of such a reality.</p>



<p>The police suddenly appearing must have been a response to breaking the game rules… That&#8217;s some serious legal action. For the time being, I entered ‘Status’ with the intention of checking my current state.</p>



<p>Hasegawa Ryou<br />Age: 25 years<br />Occupation: NEET<br />Constitution: 55<br />Charm: 12<br />Savings: 3,808,930 Yen<br />EXP: 0</p>



<p>My savings had decreased significantly. The 950,000 Yen I spent for items and 50,000 for loading had disappeared. However, the time of the save point was when I had yet to buy the items, and yet, 950,000 Yen were gone.</p>



<p>I immediately clicked on ‘Owned Items’.</p>



<p>«You currently have no items in possession.»</p>


<p>Since I had saved before buying the items, of course all of them had been reset. However, it seems that the system is such that if you use your savings even once, it can never be restored. This is quite the disadvantage for the player.</p>



<p>— Haah…</p>



<p>Sighing, after I removed the game window from my vision, I noticed something on a newly added window. It was one about my ‘Remaining Time’. Just when did this show up? This clearly didn’t exist before, but it suddenly made an appearance. While thinking about what it was, I brought my finger towards it, and out popped a message.</p>



<p>«Remaining Time: 8755 hours»<br />«Elapsed Time: 5 hours»<br />«Once the time remaining ends and capture isn’t completely cleared, your real body shall pass on.»</p>



<p>And its contents shocked me. The sense of fear started to completely rule over me. The news that my life was on the line and I’d have no choice but to be killed if I desperately didn’t do it was smacked down upon me like a hammer. Just what do I have to do to completely clear it?! Even though it doesn’t explain what the game’s capture conditions are, to tell me to completely clear it is just… </p>




<p>Taking a person’s life in custody is just way too tyrannic! Moreover, even if I load back, it seems the remaining time will just keep flowing. Waking up from sleep, comprehending this situation and loading back from the patrol car took precisely 5 hours. If I didn’t save and had been taken away by the police, I might’ve spent those 8755 hours in prison and died just like that!</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.4</strong></p>



<p>I braced myself and faced the reality I was forced to deal with. Is it really true that I&#8217;d die if the remaining time expires? Looking at the absolute powers of the items, that does seem like the case. I bet the ones who forced me into this world have both of these omnipotent abilities. I might&#8217;ve fallen into some kind of game amongst gods. Thus, I can&#8217;t help but complain about the fact that I&#8217;d die simply because I didn&#8217;t abide by the rules and clear the game. In the end, I have no choice but to relentlessly push my body forward and find the capture conditions one by one.</p>



<p>Looks like I got involved in a seriously fearsome game. In all honesty, I was terrified. However, even as I thought about this, time continued to flow. I need to continuously adapt to the circumstances reality throws at me.</p>



<p>I clicked on &#8216;Item Shop&#8217; again and read through it.</p>



<p>«LV 1 Scouter: 100,000 Yen»<br />«Sleep Spray: 250,000 Yen»<br />«Master Key: 600,000 Yen»<br />«Camera 100,000 Yen»<br />«Imported Car: 50,000,000 Yen»<br />«Domestic Car: 8,000,000 Yen»</p>



<p>This time, I didn&#8217;t think of recklessly purchasing every single item. I carefully thought about whether I should purchase one of them or not. For the time being, I decided on leaving &#8216;Sleep Spray&#8217; and &#8216;Camera&#8217; on hold. I have no plans on using them immediately. I&#8217;ll buy them later when it&#8217;s necessary, so I&#8217;ll pass.</p>



<p>Next up is Master Key. Of course I had a purpose for it. However, by any chance, if I simply use it to infiltrate her house and the cops charge in again, then 600,000 Yen will be gone in vain. </p>



<p>However, I&#8217;m also hard-pressed at the usage restriction it has. Just 6 times is quite the dicey number. There shouldn&#8217;t be any restriction on strategic items, though. Is it only for the sake of preventing convenience abuse?</p>



<p>It seems as though legal action is taken if I assault a woman, but not if I simply open the door and enter. If that&#8217;s the case, then the usage restriction on the &#8216;Master Key&#8217; is completely meaningless. Such a useless item… to not be allowed to assault the woman even though I infiltrated her house.</p>



<p>However, to be able to open absolutely any door was quite the attractive ability. I can see that I&#8217;d be able to legally use it at times when I&#8217;ll have to infiltrate or escape. If I think of it that way, then there was indeed a huge merit in getting the &#8216;Master Key&#8217; rather than ignoring it. As such, I decided to purchase it once again.</p>


<p>«Purchase Master Key for 600,000 Yen?»</p>



<p>Hesitating on the amount of money, I ended up touching the window after a long sigh. After spending 600,000 Yen, I entered &#8216;Owned Items&#8217; and read through its details… </p>



<p>«Master Key»<br />«Has the ability to open absolutely any kind of door.»<br />«Can be used by touching the window after standing in front of the desired door.»<br />«Usage Limit: 5 times»<br />-Repurchasing will not change this limit.<br />-Limit restoration is possible if repurchased after level up.</p>



<p>… in order to confirm the usage count. Just as I imagined, the usage limit had decreased from 6 times to 5. It seems like it&#8217;d be better for me to drill it into my head that even if I load back in this game, the usage count of important items will not be restored.</p>



<p>Since I had purchased an item, I updated my save point at once. I can&#8217;t have myself lose the items I purchased with great trouble slip away again like last time.</p>




<p>Setting items aside, the problem right now is how I can capture Sakurai. The information I currently possess is too insufficient. While it&#8217;s true that she&#8217;s enjoying adultery while hiding it from her husband, just how do I utilize this information?</p>



<p>I&#8217;m lacking way too much information! Capture or not, it seems possible to approach her for the time being. There&#8217;s also the part where it&#8217;s impossible for me to suddenly smooth talk my way into getting close to her. In the end, it boils down to information. With the information I currently have, forget capture, it&#8217;d just end up in the remaining time passing away. For the time being, I resolved myself into going to her house and checking it out once again.</p>



<p>I wanted to acquire some kind of information from there. Her hobby was to go to clubs, but I was curious to know if she had any other ordinary hobbies. Besides that, there was also the necessity of investigating whether the police would march in if I simply intruded upon one&#8217;s house without permission. I was already convinced that was the case, but if I confirm it with certainty, then I&#8217;d be able to use the &#8216;Master Key&#8217; risklessly.</p>



<p>So this time, I thought of waiting for a gap when she&#8217;s not home. I intently kept watch outside with my curtains rolled up. From here, I could see the entranceway to her apartment on the opposite side. It&#8217;s also because of this that I knew the time at which she comes to take the trash out.</p>



<p>The moment she comes out onto the entryway is my best chance.</p>



<p>The time was now just beyond 11:30. I got tired after keeping watch for this whole time. I was kinda getting fed up with it. My computer was looking really tempting. Shit, it would&#8217;ve been great if my PC still worked at least! It occured to me that I hadn&#8217;t left the house the entire morning. Speaking of which, she had been lying down watching TV, wearing nothing but a pair of hotpants and a T-shirt back then. In that case, she won&#8217;t be coming out for some time.</p>



<p>That&#8217;s when I decided to go to the convenience store to quell my hunger. Even the money I spent for the food there was gone after the &#8216;Load&#8217;. Thus, I went there and bought myself a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bento">bento</a>, and continued to munch away at it while keeping my eyes peeled outside my window. Time continued to flow steadily. She didn&#8217;t perhaps leave while I was out, did she?</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve heard that it takes quite a while for women to prepare before leaving. Especially if it&#8217;s for a lengthy occasion. And it was precisely this lengthy occasion that I was aiming for. That&#8217;s why I shouldn&#8217;t rush and go to her home yet. While I was starting to get irritated at the reality of not being able to do anything but stare outside, I finally noticed some movement. I saw Sakurai walking across the entryway. Wearing a pair of tight jeans and a blouse. And also seemed to be adorned in makeup.</p>



<p>No matter how one saw it, it was the attire for an outing.</p>



<p>The Scouter had mentioned she had a lot of illicit affairs on the capture information. And no matter how I see it, this indeed looks like an example of keeping one&#8217;s husband in the dark about her lovers. While thinking all that, I nimbly made my way towards her apartment. Just in case, if by any chance her husband or someone else had come to her home during the time I was out, it would be disastrous, so I stopped in the entryway and pressed the doorbell. And there was no response. Even if it was an unbreakable stone bridge, safety check was currently imperative<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>«1»</sup></a>. However, everything seemed to be alright.</p>


<p>«Would you like to use the Master Key?»</p>



<p>Calling upon the &#8216;Master Key&#8217; and clicking on the window, I unlocked the door. I entered the house without any issues. Going further in after taking off my shoes, I surveyed the living room. Just as I thought, the police didn&#8217;t come barging in. Since this was the very reason for the existence of the &#8216;Mastery Key&#8217; itself, the game can&#8217;t take legal action against it.</p>



<p>Now I was certain that the cops had broken in because I assaulted her. Feeling relieved, I looked around the house. In front of the couch was her TV. Apart from a bunch of furniture, there wasn&#8217;t anything particularly suspicious.</p>



<p>Moving towards the table, a bunch of mail and posters appeared before me. Looking through them, I found a debt notice. There were also some notices regarding unpaid loans. I wonder if they&#8217;re due to the money she secretly invested in clubs.</p>



<p>There were a total of two rooms. One of them was a bedroom, whereas the other seemed like some kind of study room. I saw her bed, dresser, as well as her closet once I entered the former. I unintentionally ended up opening her closet, inside which I found several of her clothes.</p>



<p>However, I saw no sign of her husband&#8217;s. I wonder if they store their clothes separately. Or were they living separately? Since the Scouter said they didn&#8217;t get along, my hypothesis is plausible. Leaving the bedroom, I entered the study. Whether it was her husband&#8217;s room or not, I saw several objects for men. However, all of them seemed ordinary. None seemed like they&#8217;d give me useful information.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s just that I felt quite uncomfortable due to the lifelessness. I could see a lot of dust collected atop his books. Compared to the bedroom which had absolutely no dust, it seemed as if this room was intentionally kept unclean.</p>



<p>As I thought, they must be living apart.</p>



<p>I even went to check the bathroom, which had not more than one toothbrush. Moreover, everything from the shampoo to other bathroom products were that of women. Seeing this, I&#8217;m leaning even more towards my living-apart theory.</p>



<p>The kitchen had a really large refrigerator. I returned to the living room once again. There was a picture of Sakurai and her husband atop the table, looking quite happy. Just why did these two end up drifting apart, I wonder. Perhaps due to cheating?</p>


<p>— Piriririri</p>



<p>At that moment, I heard the door lock being released. I panicked and ran into the bedroom, immediately shutting the door behind me. She returned earlier than I thought. What do I do? This is a seriously difficult situation. If she comes in here, at this rate I&#8217;ll be exposed. As I worried, the closet popped into my view. Nimbly opening it, I hid myself inside, strongly praying that she&#8217;d leave the house again.</p>



<p>I heard the door to the bedroom opening. I bet it must be Sakurai. It&#8217;s only about time that she discovers me. My heart felt like it was about to explode.</p>



<p>&#8220;My house… did you search for it a lot?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yup, it was very difficult to find.&#8221;</p>




<p>&#8220;Even though it would&#8217;ve been easier to just call me rather than pondering on it~.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s also a man&#8217;s pride, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And then you still ended up calling.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;More importantly, you sure your husband won&#8217;t be coming home?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yup, he won&#8217;t return. Stop worrying about that and let&#8217;s kiss. I can&#8217;t hold myself back anymore. Ufu!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you!&#8221;</p>



<p>At the end of those words, I heard <em>buchu-buchu</em> noises. Sheesh, they even started kissing. I&#8217;m amazed. Of all things, to kiss right in front of me. They&#8217;re about to do the thing on the bed any time soon too, aren&#8217;t they?</p>



<p>I&#8217;m getting tired of getting reminded that she has a lot of lovers. It was just then, the X-Ray Camera passed through my mind. If I take a picture of Sakurai committing adultery, wouldn&#8217;t it become quite disadvantageous to her? She probably won&#8217;t even get consolation money during divorce, so it&#8217;s imperative I get these materials to threaten her.</p>



<p>If I use this, I feel like I&#8217;d probably even be able to peer deep into her heart. Was the Camera not in the &#8216;Item Shop&#8217; for this purpose?</p>



<p>Steeling my heart, I called upon the &#8216;Item Shop&#8217;.</p>


<p>«LV 1 Scouter: 100,000 Yen»<br />«Sleep Spray: 250,000 Yen»<br />«Master Key: 600,000 Yen»<br />«Camera: 100,000 Yen»<br />«Imported Car: 50,000,000 Yen»<br />«Domestic Car: 8,000,000 Yen»</p>

<p>«Purchase Camera for 100,000 Yen?»</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.5</strong></p>

<p>I clicked on the popup window. Last time, when I saw the explanation, it said it was an item that could take photos of anything; and even see through walls. So I bet I can take a photos of them sprawled on the bed outside this closet pretty well too. The usage method was to click the window, then look in the direction where I want to take the photo of and blinking. And then it should be fine if I put it in my head that the target is a person.<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>«1»</sup></a></p>



<p>However, it was at that moment.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, won&#8217;t you like to drink some water?&#8221;</p>



<p>Looking for water right after kissing. Just what is this woman doing? Thanks to you, I can&#8217;t take a picture of you kissing anymore! Immediately, I heard the sound of their footsteps exiting the bedroom. Might as well leave the house entirely while you&#8217;re at it, please.</p>



<p>For the time being, I closely paid attention to the outside situation and,</p>



<p>&#8220;No~ stop. Pervert!&#8221;</p>



<p>The woman moaned in a coquettish tone. Looks like something happened in the kitchen. I turned around to what was my backside in the closet and blinked in the direction from where I heard the voice. Perhaps, I thought, and I turned my head slightly to the left, taking pictures of both rooms.<a id="s2" href="#n2"><sup>«2»</sup></a> The usage limit was 3 times. For the time being, I decided to verify the photos I took first, leaving the last chance remaining in case the two were out of focus.</p>



<p>And then immediately, a message appeared before me.</p>



<p>«Would you like to verify the photos?»</p>



<p>«Image file 1»<br />«Image file 2»</p>



<p>Two files appeared. Well of course, since I took two of them. I confirmed the first one, from which appeared the scene of the pair being on top of one another in their naked bodies. That was a good shot. While I was filled with content, I heard their voices once again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Say~, could you lend me some more money?&#8221;</p>



<p>They were kissing just a while ago, but now I distinctly heard money being requested.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? I lent you some just while back, though. Again?&#8221;</p>




<p>&#8220;Even though… you have so much lying around…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just what do you need so much money for? Is your husband not earning anymore?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;We&#8217;re living apart right now since I got caught cheating. I can&#8217;t even collect the consolation money, so I need it…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Seriously woman, you… Anyways, until you return the money I lent you last time…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Heyyy~! I&#8217;ll treat you really~ nicely, so… why don&#8217;t we take a shower together? I&#8217;ll give you plenty of service, so go ahead and enter before me. Bring a change of clothes too, &#8216;kay~?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuu—n. I wonder what kind of service they&#8217;ll be~? Should I get my hopes up?&#8221;</p>



<p>And after the last bit, I couldn&#8217;t hear them anymore. However, that conversation gave me a feeling of emptiness. If Sakurai&#8217;s husband already knew that she was cheating on him, then these photos had become totally meaningless. I thought it was a good card to play to capture her, but the feeling quickly faded now that I realized it was just a careless move.</p>



<p>I heard the sound of the man entering the bedroom. If he was going to get a change of clothes, then he should be coming to this closet. At that instant, the nervousness made me gulp a ball of saliva. If he opened this closet then I&#8217;d have no choice but to &#8216;Load&#8217; again. I prepared my finger over the &#8216;Load&#8217; window ahead just in case, but then I heard the sound of Sakurai entering as well and closing the door behind her. </p>



<p>Why the door? Of course, it&#8217;s still bad news if you do or not. Because the change of clothes was definitely in the closet. This is already a hopeless situation.</p>



<p>However, the closet wasn&#8217;t opened. More like, I heard a <em>gasa-gasa</em> sound instead. <em>Gasa-gasa</em>. Something like the sound of an envelope being ripped open, but it wasn&#8217;t really loud, so I can&#8217;t say for sure.</p>



<p>And then, after I heard her footsteps, she stopped right in front of the closet. It was all over, I thought.</p>



<p>However, right after that, she opened the door and left the bedroom just like that.</p>



<p>The sound of water came afterwards.</p>



<p>— Sshaaa—</p>



<p>They said they&#8217;d do it while in the shower, so it seems it was already that time. So, they ended up not needing a change? Either way, this is my chance. A chance to run! Carefully, I opened the closet door.</p>



<p>And slipped out of the bedroom. Just as I thought, there&#8217;s nobody here. Let&#8217;s try checking the living room. And yet still, there was nobody. All I heard was a voice. Thinking it was a chance given to me by God, I slipped out of the house.</p>



<p>From there, I returned home for the moment. I sat on the bed. Looks like the Camera ended up a failure. She&#8217;s an opponent I can&#8217;t even threaten. After letting out several deep breaths, I sorted out the information I acquired from my infiltration.</p>



<p>Seeing how she had several debt repayment letters and how she asked her lover for money, there was no doubt that she&#8217;s a gold digger. In that case, the last resort is money? Demand notices of unpaid loans. And if I connect the dots with her tendency to ask her lovers for money, then she&#8217;s in a serious financial crisis. If I can somehow get her interested in me by hinting that I have a lot of money, then she might just approach me on her own.</p>



<p>If money didn&#8217;t work, then there was no other way. No matter how much I wracked my brain, that was the final method. I immediately ran towards the nearest bank and withdrew 500,000 Yen. If it&#8217;s this much, then she might actually go mad and pounce at me. Especially if it&#8217;s her who has so much debt piled up.</p>



<p>Afterwards, I went back home and started to observe her entranceway again. She&#8217;s probably having quite the intense moment with her illicit lover about now. And once the fun time is over, she&#8217;ll be coming out to send him off. That would be the best chance, I thought.</p>



<p>However, no matter how much I kept my eyes peeled, there was no sign of them coming out.</p>



<p>— Shit!</p>



<p>That man, is he planning on staying over for the night? No matter how much they&#8217;re living apart, to think that she&#8217;d bring another man and let him sleep over in her room, I was truly shocked speechless! Even though I had to fight against this boredom the whole time, I kept trying to find more clues as to how I could get closer to capture her, to the point that I even ended up staring outside through the dead of the night. But in the end, Sakurai never ended up coming out. And neither did the man.</p>



<p>No doubt he&#8217;s staying over. In the end the whole plan turned out to be pushed back all the way to the morning. The man should have his own job to deal with, so I bet he wouldn&#8217;t be staying for two days in a row.</p>



<p>Afterwards, I lay down on my bed. Since I&#8217;ve been maintaining surveillance this whole time, my eyes hurt and I was dead exhausted. I ended up falling asleep immediately.</p>

<p>And then suddenly, my eyes shot open. Everything turned out to be a dream once I woke up, was not the kind of development that happened. I stood and stretched up my body on my toes and yawned. Even now, the &#8216;Game Window&#8217; was in the corner of my vision. Flustered, I checked the time. It was about ten o&#8217;clock.</p>



<p>I slept quite a bit. While being surprised at the great deal of time that had passed, I looked out the window. There, I saw Sakurai leaving to take out the trash. The time at which she took out the trash seemed to always be decided. Looks like the man returned home before I even noticed. I had lost my chance, being asleep at the time.</p>



<p>I grabbed my money and descended down to her apartment with haste. Just as I thought, she was done with her trash and was on her way back inside. I faced myself towards her and ran as fast as I could, bumping my shoulder onto her and dropping my money on purpose. The plan was that I&#8217;d give off the appearance that I&#8217;m in a hurry somewhere with this cash and accidentally bumped into her, forcing her take a look at it. I even completed saving while I ran. All preparations complete!</p>



<p>&#8220;Ahh…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Aah, I&#8217;m so-y<a id="s3" href="#n3"><sup>«3»</sup></a>!&#8221;</p>



<p>Just as expected, while I apologized and was busy picking up the dough, Sakurai kept a watchful eye on me. With curiosity and greed in her eyes, she started to help me pick it up too. While handing me back the portion she had picked up, she gave flirtatious glances at me.</p>



<p>Flirtatious glances that were sexy enough that I&#8217;d have already fallen for her if I hadn&#8217;t known her true nature. But now that I do, she looks like nothing but a living mass of greed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you alright? Carrying such a large sum in broad daylight, what would you have done if you encountered a purse snatcher?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I had just drawn it out to go have some fun, so I just… Anyways, thank you very much!&#8221;</p>



<p>I purposely said it indirectly to probe out a reaction from her. And immediately, her eyes started sparkling.</p>


<p>&#8220;Rather than spending money in places like those, how about you come play with me~? Fufu, I&#8217;m also quite good at this, so… well?&#8221;</p>



<p>She casually made gestures of revealing her body and invitingly whispered into my ear. She strongly grasped at my arm that held onto the money, as if to say she wouldn&#8217;t ever let me go. Even though I spent so much effort in thinking up possible methods to convince her, in the end it was settled in one go. Looks like the keyword to approach this woman was indeed money. I gave a somewhat troubled look and then made a serious expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Pardon? When you say play, what do you…&#8221;</p>



<p>Perhaps thinking that she had finally caught me hook, line and sinker, Sakurai smiled and pulled at my arm.</p>



<p>&#8220;If it&#8217;s playing between adults, then of course it&#8217;s <em>that</em>, isn&#8217;t it? Let us neighbors thoroughly enjoy ourselves, hmm? Hohoh! Come, stop by my place.&#8221;</p>



<p>Surprisingly, that sounded very convincing. She was indeed very much in need of money. Is she planning on asking me to lend it to her? If I continue to her room and end up in bed with her like this, would that be considered a successful capture? Even while I was aware of her painfully strong greed, my heart kept racing. In the end, I wound up stepping into her house anyway, where she advised me to sit on her couch.</p>



<p>&#8220;What about your husband?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I asked her about it, seeing the wedding photo set in front of me, suddenly, a sad expression arose onto her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;We got divorced. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m lonely these days…&#8221;</p>



<p>Divorced she says, don&#8217;t make me laugh! I already know you&#8217;re living apart, so what&#8217;s with this sudden divorce story?! Rather, if you&#8217;re already divorced then it&#8217;s weird that you&#8217;re still putting up this photo as internal decor! Thinking about this random bs, I shot up from the couch. Stressed out, I wanted to go to the washroom.</p>



<p>&#8220;Would it be okay to use your washroom for a bit?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course! It&#8217;s that way.&#8221;</p>



<p>I ended up entering her washroom before she finished speaking. Well, shit. Since I already knew where it was, my body thoughtlessly ended up entering on its own. Wouldn&#8217;t it be really suspicious for a person you just invited to already know where your toilet is?</p>



<p>Once I exited, I saw Sakurai pouring out something to drink in the kitchen. She didn&#8217;t seem like she suspected me on the outside. As usual, her gaze was always on the bundle I had in my hand. That&#8217;s when I tried leaving the notes on the table; and her gaze naturally rolled over to them.</p>



<p>And then, time froze. I was enveloped in a white light. Looks like the choices are gonna come up again. As expected, once the world froze, two options appeared before my eyes.</p>



<p>«Choice 1: Barge into the study.»<br />«Choice 2: Chat with her.»</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1.6</strong></p>


<p>Why the study all of a sudden? I chose number 2. A choice for the study was way too extra. Completing my choice, my body regained its freedom. Holding a glass of orange juice in her hands, Sakurai started to ask me a bunch of stuff.</p>



<p>&#8220;You seem quite wealthy.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her gaze was exceedingly bewitching, full of shine and shimmer. Looks like she&#8217;s indeed greatly attached to money.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, it&#8217;s actually just money I was entrusted with. You could say it&#8217;s something a friend and I collected to fool around with… Haha!&#8221; </p>



<p>Sakurai clicked her tongue as she listened to what I said. And then, handed me the glass, followed by her gently pressing her own lips against mine. A kiss. Her plump lips felt incredibly soft to the touch. And then… she naturally shoved her tongue into my mouth. I had let my lips part for the time being since we were in the middle of kissing, and as she withdrew her lips back, a fine thread of saliva was left dangling between us.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall I do something even nicer~? How about you finish the drink for now and then I let you into my bedroom, hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>What is she up to?</p>



<p>I had left the bundle on the table. And her gaze had veered towards it as expected. But just what should I do right now? I can&#8217;t understand what qualifies as a capture at all! If this game is advocating the whole eroge thing then it means I&#8217;d have to go sleep with her, doesn&#8217;t it?</p>



<p>The arousal of being left unsatisfied with a kiss.</p>



<p>Leaving the glass near the bundle, I pulled her hand in. However, Sakurai shook her head and handed me the glass again.</p>



<p>&#8220;I went so far as to pour this juice for you, and you won&#8217;t be drinking it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Even as she said so, her gaze veered off to the roll of notes again as usual.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s quite pathetic that a woman like her would go that far, but either way, I chugged down a gulp for the time being. Followed by pulling her hand close again for the capture. No, I had attempted to.</p>



<p>However, Sakurai shook my hands off and started grinning intensely.</p>


<img src="https://i0.wp.com/hinjakuhonyaku.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Sakurai.Ami_.full_.2735156-1.jpg?resize=721%2C1024&#038;ssl=1"></img>


<p>And at the same time, I was assaulted by the pain of having my internal organs boil up. It was as if my blood started to flow in reverse, or that my stomach was about to burst open. The excruciating pain made the contents inside my chest cavity turn over. And then something spurted out my oesophagus. I instinctively grasped my neck and fell over. Stemming from my subconscious will to live, I forced myself to move my hand. It was a miracle that could even read the &#8216;Load&#8217; window.</p>



<p>And so the world turned white.</p>



<p>That crazy bitch tried to kill me by poisoning the drink! I never even imagined she&#8217;d go that far to steal 500,000 Yen! Isn&#8217;t this murder?! Now I&#8217;m sweating buckets in terror! If she used some of those potassium cyanides that come up in dramas for instant death, then I wouldn&#8217;t even have time to load! I was really lucky to only have one gulp! Seriously, a miracle!</p>



<p>Now that I think about it, I heard her call me wealthy that time. She still had the glass in her hand back then. If I had answered yes, then it&#8217;s possible she might&#8217;ve put the poisoning on hold to extort more money out of me. The more I thought about it, the more I was astonished.</p>



<p>What should I do?</p>



<p>Guess there&#8217;s no choice but to keep going for the time being. It should be fine as long as I don&#8217;t put anything she brings out into my mouth. As long as I get that, then I should be able to stay cautious of anything. She&#8217;s a woman. She can&#8217;t win against me in strength. However, the actual capture has already begun to direct towards a different kind of concern. The choices that appeared. Go to the study. The reason for the appearance of such a ludicrous choice.</p>



<p>I thought that it was this option that had something to do with the capture.</p>



<p>And thus once again, I ran towards her house and acted in the exact same way, leading to the same choices appearing once more.</p>



<p>«Choice 1: Barge into the study.»<br />«Choice 2: Chat with her.»</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right. This is exactly it.</p>



<p>The second choice was already a death flag.</p>



<p>If I choose the first choice, then I&#8217;d get closer to the capture. That&#8217;s what sparked in me.</p>



<p>I immediately chose number 1 and ran towards the study. When I did, Sakurai, suddenly startled, called out to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Please wait a minute! Don&#8217;t go there!&#8221;</p>



<p>She was obviously acting strange. Let&#8217;s try opening the door, shall we? Last time I checked, it was just a room full of dust. Just what has changed since then?</p>



<p>The study that entered my vision hadn&#8217;t really changed. But that was only what was in front of me.</p>



<p>When I unintentionally dropped my line of sight to the floor, I saw the man sprawled across it. His body lying there and his mouth foaming, he looked exactly like I did right before I clicked &#8216;Load&#8217;.</p>



<p>Shit.</p>



<p>So it wasn&#8217;t just me, but she had also killed her lover who refused to give her more money? Turns out there was already a reason for why I never saw him go back home even though I had my eyes on her entryway the whole time! Because he was dead!</p>



<p>As I was busy thinking this and that, before I even noticed, Sakurai had grabbed a kitchen knife and was on her way to pounce at me.</p>


<p>&#8220;DIEEEEEE!&#8221;</p>



<p>Though I had been startled stiff, even if she was a woman, the story is completely different if she&#8217;s with a lethal weapon like that. I mean, it&#8217;s not like I knew martial arts. I panicked and slammed the door, locking it from the inside of the study.</p>



<p>My mind was a mess. I&#8217;m currently in this messed up situation where I&#8217;m locked up inside a room with a dead man beside me. What to do… report her? It was then, I thought of an even better idea. Even if I do report her, it would still take time for them to dispatch their units.</p>



<p>Wasn&#8217;t this a situation why the &#8216;Sleep Spray&#8217; existed? Rather than using it to assault women, it was an &#8216;Item&#8217; prepared for the sake of self-defense.</p>



<p>Thinking that, I immediately entered the &#8216;Game Window&#8217;, and then, a message appeared before me.</p>


<p>«Would you like to verify the photos?»</p>



<p>«Image file 1»<br />«Image file 2»</p>



<p>Now that I think about it, before I loaded back, I had only verified the first file before I got rid of the &#8216;Game Window&#8217; from view. I had saved after that, so it seems these haven&#8217;t been reset. But wait, shouldn&#8217;t the opening screen come up again since I had gotten rid of the &#8216;Game Window&#8217;?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s where I decided to click on the bottommost &#8216;Return&#8217; button, resulting in the &#8216;Game Window&#8217; minimizing back to the corner. What? Taken aback, I opened the screen again.</p>



<p>And once more… </p>



<p>«Would you like to verify the photos?»</p>



<p>«Image file 1»<br />«Image file 2»</p>



<p>… the same message appeared. Is this that? This thing would only leave once I&#8217;ve verified everything including the second image file too?</p>



<p>What a pain in the ass. I don&#8217;t even need the photos anymore.</p>



<p>Having no choice, I clicked on «Image file 2», resulting in it appearing.</p>




<p>It was of the space beside the table. I had clearly gotten both her and her lover in the first picture but only their hands in the second.</p>



<p>But what surprised me was the fact that I could even see into the refrigerator in the photo. What was in the fridge was some kind of person.</p>



<p>It can&#8217;t be, was this her husband?!</p>



<p>I thought that they were living apart, but to think he was killed.</p>



<p>I suddenly felt the surge of the whole puzzle coming together.</p>



<p>She was a money craving homicidal maniac!</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Sakurai kept banging the door repeatedly. I wonder if she had brought the keys since I could hear jingling noises. My heart became restless. Having already verified the images, the opening screen finally appeared.</p>



<p>Entering &#8216;Item&#8217;, I clicked on &#8216;Item Shop&#8217;, and purchased the &#8216;Sleep Spray&#8217;.</p>



<p>«Would you like to use the Sleep Spray?»</p>



<p>As I stood there having opened the message, Sakurai wrenched open the door and entered. Gripping the kitchen knife tight, she came pouncing at me. The range of the &#8216;Sleep Spray&#8217; was 1 meter.</p>



<p>My palms were sweaty. Little by little, the distance between us shrunk. Thinking &#8216;Now&#8217;s the time!&#8217; when the distance reached that point, I immediately clicked on the message and stared at her. Like that, she fell asleep amidst her pounce and fell on top of the man&#8217;s corpse.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know about capturing or whatever, but Sakurai was a woman with whom it was impossible to coexist with. Trembling, I left the study. When I entered the kitchen, I found the medicine capsule that was left at the corner of the sink. Was she already prepared to poison that man back then? I inadvertently started laughing.</p>



<p>And then, I stood before the long awaited refrigerator. The eerie feeling of seeing this fridge that seemed too large for the room engraved itself into my heart. I had never even thought of looking in it by thinking there was a corpse inside.</p>



<p>Resolving myself about reporting her, I opened it, and out blew the chilly breeze. Just as the photo showed, the body lay there in exactly the same way. Unable to see this cruel scene anymore, I closed the door shut; and after reporting to the police using the nearby telephone, I returned back home.</p>



<p>It was quite the eventful day<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>«1»</sup></a>. This wouldn&#8217;t be what a capture was, was it? Capture didn&#8217;t refer to sex, but to uncover all the mysteries spread across this world?</p>



<p>Thinking, perhaps that might be it, I decided to open the &#8216;Game Window&#8217; and check the current &#8216;Status&#8217;.</p>



<p>And when I did, a message immediately appeared.</p>



<p>«Hidden mystery &#8216;Money Crazed Married Woman&#8217; has been cleared.»</p>



<p>«Congratulations. A bonus of 5,000,000 Yen has been deposited.»</p>



<p>«EXP +35»</p>
