<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Labyrinth of the Night Streets</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.1</strong></p>

<p>Of course, she&#8217;s also a capture target candidate. Since she&#8217;s ranked A, then there&#8217;s no mistaking it, that was why she appeared like so in the scouter. However, at a glance, her difficulty is way too high. I can&#8217;t even begin to imagine the kind of shitstorm the missions involving her hidden secrets would be like. To say something like &#8216;save me from this boredom&#8217;, just what kind of gargantuan underworld is she being kept sealed in? It&#8217;s way too different from the world I live in. No matter what, I had absolutely no intention of carrying any further conversations with her at my current level. Not even a thousand lives would be enough.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah! Come to think of it, you avoided having sex with me, didn&#8217;t you, Oji-san? Why is that? Back then, even after you were so rock hard, even with such stimulation, to not have done it, do you perhaps have some kind ability to sense danger?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, you could say that. I&#8217;m quite sensitive to danger. If I had been moved by your words and had actually done you, then…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hm? It&#8217;s possible you&#8217;d be dead. Yeah, that&#8217;s not fun at all. If we actually did it back then, eventually, it would&#8217;ve turned out the way I expected. The bullet could&#8217;ve come flying from absolutely any direction, mind you, Oji-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hahaha…&#8221;</p>



<p>I was at a loss for words. But her expression from when she said she seemed quite dejected. So that would mean that even this woman has her own troubles to deal with. It&#8217;s possible that it&#8217;s related to the hidden missions involving her. However, now&#8217;s not the time. I obliquely stood up from the bench. She looked up at me from where she still sat.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about time I return home, I guess. You went back last time saying you had something to take care of, right? This time, it&#8217;s mine…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fu—n. Fine, I&#8217;ll let you return for today. I&#8217;m getting sleepy too. I&#8217;m a night owl, so I tend to lie in bed during morning hours. To be honest, it kinda pissed me off being called out at this time, but I&#8217;ll let you off this one time. Ah, and, you still have the number I gave you last time, right? That&#8217;s not my residential number, but a direct hotline to me. Something akin to a cell phone, you could say. I don&#8217;t carry one around since it&#8217;s a pain in the ass… There are way too many people with the lack of common sense who keep bothering me with pointless requests and solicitation, but while that may be true, I can&#8217;t have just one person kill people one at a time, right? But I&#8217;ll give you my special permission to call me. However, if it&#8217;s anything dull, I won&#8217;t forgive you. See you again then, Oji-san. Also, this is an order but, it&#8217;d be in your best interests to drop whatever you&#8217;re doing and make haste towards me whenever I call for you. With that said, good night, Oji-san.&#8221;</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>With those parting words, she walked away from the bus stop. Suddenly, a black sedan appeared. There were no words spoken. Of all things, to get entangled with a woman like that…&nbsp; There are just some things in this world that are better left unknown.</p>


<p>Ever since I took her into the love hotel, she had already kept her eyes on me, so even if I loaded back, there was no way to rid myself from her existence. That&#8217;s why, my top priority right now is to level up. In order to stay alive. And of course also in order to return to my original world. In any case, this isn&#8217;t the time to resist. I need to hurry up and find my next target to capture her.</p>



<p>I wiped off my earlier impression of Kusora. I thought of her to be a reserved and gentle girl, but that was no more than an illusion.</p>



<p>However, these complicated feelings… left behind a gaping hole in a corner of my heart. It&#8217;s possible that I might&#8217;ve fallen in love with the Kusora she was acting as. But what remained from that was a considerably stern demoness if one ever associated with her. Carrying the weight of my broken heart with me, I returned back home.</p>



<p>For the time being, I deemed Kusora to be way uninvolved with the social parties. She was only looking for something fun to do. If she was the real mastermind behind the scenes, then it should&#8217;ve been impossible to capture Akemine. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d be able to deal with a woman holding such indomitable power at my current level.</p>



<p>And like that, I reopened my long forgotten status window.<br>I was in such a huge shock that it completely slipped my mind…<br>To check if the capture was really successful or not.</p>



<p>«Hidden Mission &#8216;Face of Lies&#8217;: Cleared. Mission Difficulty: C.»<br>«Congratulations. A bonus of 30,000,000 ¥ has been deposited»</p>



<p>Like so, the message that oh-so longed for appeared.<br>As expected, Kusora and Akemine&#8217;s captures were separate issues.</p>



<p>If that would&#8217;ve been the case, then I&#8217;d load back and avoid coming into contact with her, and treat raising my level as my topmost priority. But… it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;d be able to keep avoiding her all my life. Some day or another, Kusora would&#8217;ve become a capture target anyway.<br>I absolutely have to garner up my strength. No matter what.<br>With that, I completed saving.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not all bad news though. Since the capture difficulty this time was quite high, I profited from it quite appropriately, I&#8217;d say. Thirty million yen. A jaw-dropping amount of money. With this, the variety of items most definitely should have widened considerably.</p>



<p>After clicking on the message and having it disappear, I clicked to check my &#8216;Status&#8217;.</p>



<p>Hasegawa Ryou<br>Age: 25 years<br>Occupation: NEET<br>Level: 3<br>Constitution: 55<br>Charm: 22<br>Savings: 32,870,530 ¥<br>EXP: 205/502</p>



<p>Entries that I&#8217;ve gotten used to seeing.<br>And more messages kept popping out one after another…<br>Due to my level rising.</p>



<p>«You have leveled up. You can improve your ability points. (0/50)»</p>



<p>Constitution: 55/999 +-<br>Charm: 22/999 +-</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no need to even read it. I added 40 points to my Charm and 10 to my Constitution right away. Currently, the most important was Charm. It&#8217;s possible that the only reason Akemine took notice of me was because of Charm points. I wonder if she would still be able to make that kind of face and treat me so coldly if I was an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikemen">ikemen</a> overflowing with charm. I think the Charm points would be the most important factor in aiding me to approach more capture targets.</p>


<p>«You have leveled up. You can improve your ability points. (50/50)»</p>



<p>Constitution: 65/999 +-<br>Charm: 62/999 +-</p>



<p>It rose to 62. With this much, it has to be able to cause some kind change on the physical level, right? 12 to 62 is quite the big leap. Having such thoughts, I went to check in the mirror of my washroom. But just like before, I looked exactly the same.</p>



<p>I wonder if it&#8217;s like the Morph Potion where even though I can&#8217;t find a difference, other people would still be aware of it. I kinda get that sort of feeling. As I answered my own questions, my hand made its way to the &#8216;Remaining Time&#8217; window.</p>



<p>«Remaining Time: 8648 hours»<br>«Elapsed Time: 112 hours»<br>«Once the time remaining ends and capture isn’t completely cleared, your real body shall pass on.»</p>



<p>112 hours. There&#8217;s still plenty of time.<br>But I still have no clue as to what the condition for complete clearance is. Whatever I do, I have no choice but to continue on with my captures. That&#8217;s when the Game TIP window appeared before me like last time. So there&#8217;s no doubt that with each successive mission completed, the game will provide me with some kind of info. They were indispensable information in this game, that has no concept of a manual or the like.</p>



<p>«TIP: The women in this game world will receive the laws of the game systems. Even if the same people exist in your original world, they are completely different people. However, as a special privilege, once you&#8217;ve completely cleared the game, targets above 80 Affection Points will obtain accession into the real world.»</p>



<p>Just as I thought, this was a parallely existing replica of the real world. But other than that, this last part <em>really</em> caught my attention. Does this mean that people who I have high Affection Points, or a positive relationship with, would also be able to exist in the real world?</p>



<p>Pondering over just how absurd this system was, I got rid of the window with another click. I did find it regrettable if I had to get rid of my ties with someone I got close to after a capture was completed. This info is… not bad. Shrugging, I clicked on the Items next…</p>



<p>And read through the Owned Items section. The first thing that needed to be done was item strengthening.</p>



<p>«Owned Items»</p>



<p>«LV 2 Scouter»<br>«Master Key»<br>«Sleep Spray»<br>«Camera»<br>«Telescope»</p>



<p>Firstly, the Master Key.</p>



<p>«Master Key»«Enhanced 1»<br>«Has the ability to open absolutely any kind of door.»<br>«Can be used by touching the window after standing in front of the desired door.»<br>«Item enhancement is possible since you have leveled up.»</p>



<p>The item enhancement message for the Master Key also popped up like last time.</p>


<p><em>Click.</em> <a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>



<p>«Enhance this item? Enhancement cost: 200,000 ¥»</p>



<p>The second stage enhancement costs 200,000, huh. Fumu. Well, I earned 30,000,000 anyway, so it&#8217;s not like I have anything to worry about.</p>



<p><em>Click.</em></p>



<p>«Enhancement complete.»</p>



<p>«Master Key»«Enhanced 2»<br>«Has the ability to open absolutely any kind of door.»<br>«Can be used by touching the window after standing in front of the desired door.»<br>«Remaining Uses: 10 times»</p>



<p>The usage limit got enhanced. A surprising total of 10 times. That&#8217;s plenty. As I recalled the time from when it was a mere 6, I became filled with emotion.</p>



<p>With this all A-OK, the next important item would be the one capable of being used as a weapon, the &#8216;Sleep Spray&#8217;.</p>



<p>«Sleep Spray»«Enhanced 1»<br>«Just as the name implies, a sleep spray. Boasts incredible performance.»<br>«After touching the item window, simply staring at the target is sufficient.»<br>«Range: 2 meters»<br>«Effect Duration: 2 hours»<br>«Item enhancement is possible since you have leveled up.»</p>



<p>Similarly, it was also possible to enhance the Sleep Spray. If so, there&#8217;s no need for any hesitation.</p>



<p><em>Click.</em></p>



<p>«Enhance this item? Enhancement cost: 200,000 ¥»</p>



<p>I completed my transaction of the same amount as the Master Key.</p>



<p>«Sleep Spray»«Enhanced 2»<br>«Just as the name implies, a sleep spray. Boasts incredible performance.»<br>«After touching the item window, simply staring at the target is sufficient.»<br>«Range: 3 meters»<br>«Effect Duration: 3 hours»<br>+Enhanced Effect Duration: 2 hour → 3 hours<br>+Enhanced Range: 2 meter → 3 meters</p>



<p>This too was quite satisfactory. The enhancement results were just as expected. It went so well with my expectations that the lack of the element of surprise kinda made this dull. Ah, has Kusora been living her whole life with this kind of feeling? Damn, out all the people, why&#8217;d I have to relate to her? I gave myself a tight slap.</p>



<p>«Owned Items»</p>



<p>«LV 2 Scouter»<br>«Master Key»<br>«Sleep Spray»<br>«Camera»<br>«Telescope»</p>



<p>Apart from the Master Key and Sleep Spray, it wasn&#8217;t possible to enhance any other item. Hence, this concluded the strengthening phase. And now, it&#8217;s time to put my attention towards the &#8216;Item Shop&#8217;.</p>



<p>«LV 3 Scouter: 300,000 ¥»<br>«Sleep Spray: 250,000 ¥»<br>«Master Key: 600,000 ¥»<br>«Camera: 100,000 ¥»<br>«Morph Potion: 1,000,000 ¥»<br>«Telescope: 700,000 ¥»<br>«Stopwatch: 30,000,000 ¥»<br>«Glasses: 500,000 ¥»<br>«Imported Car: 50,000,000 ¥»<br>«Domestic Car: 8,000,000 ¥»</p>



<p>«Purchase LV 3 Scouter?&gt;&gt;</p>



<p>For now, the most fundamental entry to be purchased would be the &#8216;LV 3 Scouter&#8217;.<br>And then there&#8217;s also the newly added &#8216;Glasses&#8217;.<br>With the state of my current savings, there pretty much isn&#8217;t any item I can&#8217;t get.<br>On the contrary, they all feel cheap.</p>



<p>«Purchase Glasses?&gt;&gt;</p>



<p>With the transactions complete, it was time to check out the details.</p>



<p>«Glasses»<br>«Makes darkness seem as bright as daylight.&gt;&gt;</p>



<p>Quite normal for something worth 500,000. I wonder if it&#8217;s because it&#8217;s just that cheap of an item floating about amongst ones on the levels of tens of millions of yen. It wasn&#8217;t really springing up my curiosity either. The use case would be when I&#8217;d have to get inside and navigate in some kind of dark room or something. The amount expended for enhancement was 1,200,000 ¥. Since I got myself 30,000,000, it wasn&#8217;t really that much. In the end, the items are necessary expenses for the sake of captures, so there&#8217;s no point in being stingy with them.</p>



<p>With that, I wanted to try out a pricey item for once. Although the 30 million yen Stopwatch and the 50 million yen Imported Car might be too much, it should be fine to check out the Domestic Car for now. I was curious about it from the very beginning. And with solid resoluteness…</p>



<p><em>Click.</em></p>



<p>«Purchase Domestic Car?&gt;&gt;</p>



<p>Praying to the game gods such that I hadn&#8217;t ended up pointless burning up cash, I decided to check the details</p>



<p>«Domestic Car»<br>«Item <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gacha_game">gacha</a>~!!»<br>«A single click, and the random item drop will commence.»<br>«Best of luck ^^ »</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was for better or worse, but that was the message that popped up. Item gacha it says. So what, these guys also intend to promote gambling?! I feel like I got trapped or something. But I already bought it, so might as well go for a pull. That too worth 8 million. As I clicked on the message that appeared, I was greeted with some weird sound.</p>



<p><em>Tiririro tirorirororo~!!</em></p>



<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>



<p><em>And so the item gacha result are~</em></p>



<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>



<p><em>A dud. Good luck next time.</em></p>



<p>Uwooooh!!! I clenched my fist and swung at the message. Although I did that, it only ended up landing on air. I just lost 8,000,000 ¥ to nothing! With rage seething through me, I entered the Item Shop once again and ended up repurchasing the Domestic Car.</p>



<p>«Purchase Domestic Car?»</p>



<p>The burning urge to take it all back made me lose my sanity. By the time I regained composure, it was all already over. No, this time it&#8217;s really the last. If I actually get absolutely nothing after spending 16,000,000 ¥ I will legit go crazy. Enough to make me start crying.</p>



<p>Pressing myself onwards, I entered the Owned Items section. As I clicked for details, that accursed message appeared once again.</p>



<p>«Domestic Car»<br>«Item gacha~!!»<br>«A single click, and the random item drop will commence.»<br>«Best of luck ^^ »</p>



<p>Feeling a sense of my luck being a hundred fold greater than before, I clicked. Please, I beg of you!!</p>



<p><em>Tiririro tirorirororo~!!</em></p>



<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>

<p><em>And so the item gacha result are~</em></p>



<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>



<p>.</p>



<p>«Acquired &#8216;Formless Sword&#8217;. »</p>



<p>And so… &#8216;something&#8217; appeared. Not a dud, but… something. A sigh of relief escaped me. The name of the item sounded pretty cool, if I must say. &#8216;Formless Sword&#8217;. I wonder if it lives up to such a name. Without helping the curiosity welling inside me, I clicked on the Owned Items again.</p>



<p>«Owned Items»</p>



<p>«LV 2 Scouter»<br>«Master Key»<br>«Sleep Spray»<br>«Camera»<br>«Telescope»<br>«Glasses»<br>«Formless Sword»</p>



<p>Which is where I saw the entry of the &#8216;Formless Sword&#8217;. My heart beating faster and faster, it felt like my chest was about to burst. As I kept mincing and quivering, I read through its details. With my eyelids half closed, I very carefully, and cautiously ran my eyes over it. Simply looking at the huge drop in my funds was enough to make me a hundred times more nervous.</p>



<p>«Formless Sword»<br>«This immaterial sword will parry any and all attacks in your line of sight. »<br>«However, it&#8217;s only possible for attacks that you can see. Useless against any surprised attacks that are impossible to predict. »</p>



<p>It&#8217;s somehow quite… awesome. Wouldn&#8217;t this pretty much be considered a rare item at this point? It was an item I was pretty much in dire need of at the moment. It was well worth the investment. It might be possible for me to repel even the bullets that Kusora would shoot at me. I was floating in such elation that I couldn&#8217;t help but reread its details again and again.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s just say that it&#8217;s something quite reliable. I&#8217;m hella satisfied! I never want to resign myself to the fate of lotteries again, but nevertheless, I got my hands on something incredible. I wonder if I&#8217;m a man of luck. Fuhaha!</p>



<p>With everything reaching its conclusion, I happily lay down on my bed. Thanks to the numerous thoughts that sprung up with daydreaming about all the ways I would be able to face Kusora with this Formless Sword, I finally felt like I&#8217;d be able to get a good night&#8217;s sleep. Well, let&#8217;s rest now, shall we. Searching for the next capture target can be left for after I wake up the next day.</p>



<p>With all my fatigue pressing down on me in one go, I gradually fell into a deep slumber.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.2</strong></p>

<p>The darkness of night loomed heavier in the streets. And amidst such darkness, I continued to walk. The drifting clouds covered up the moonlight being cast down from the night sky like that of thin curtains, thus darkening the desolate night even more.</p>



<p>By the time I woke up, it was already the dead of the night. Judging from how deeply I slept, it serves to show just how fatigued I was in both mind and body.</p>



<p>Thus night had fallen. The cramped room in which I lived, being unable to even turn on my computer, I could feel nothing but solitude. Unable to bear it, I decided to go for a walk. 2 o&#8217;clock at night. For the common folk, this was a time where one would already be drifting in their dreams. Thanks to that, the night streets were dead quiet.</p>



<p>I wonder if I can even expect to find a capture target like this. I won&#8217;t hold any high expectations, since there wouldn&#8217;t really be that many women walking around the streets in such a dark night. As I walked and walked, I caught a glimpse of a light from somewhere. Whoa, a food cart. To think there&#8217;d be a food cart running at such quiet hours. Would this even be good for business, I wonder. Come to think of it, I&#8217;m kinda hungry. It&#8217;s really rare to find a stall open at such a time.</p>



<p>As I made my way straight towards it, I heard a voice call out.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nodding slightly to the keeper as a greeting, I sat on an empty seat. More like, I was the only customer here. The cart being on the smaller side, it would be easy to move around. I wonder if it was specially made in order to avoid authorities and serve around in different places. As bubbling sound and the steam carrying the fragrance of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oden">oden</a> wafted into my ears and nostrils, my hunger was further aggravated.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;One bowl of ramen, please.&#8221;</p>



<p>The menu was a simple and classic assortment of ramen, yakitori and oden.<br>And among them, I ordered myself my favorite.</p>



<p>&#8220;Right away.&#8221;</p>



<p>The keeper oba-san<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> replied with a bright smile. And before long, the ramen was placed before my eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for your patience.&#8221;</p>



<p>I got a naturally pleasant feeling from the lady&#8217;s gentle appearance and delicious dish. I wonder if it&#8217;s thanks to my improved Charm points. Till now, I&#8217;ve never had someone treat me in such a fresh manner no matter where I went. Whether it was a convenience store or a restaurant, an oba-san or a young woman, they&#8217;ve always been the same.</p>



<p>Now that I think about it, ironically enough, the only woman who has seen me inside and out is Kusora. Besides my mother, of course.</p>



<p>Ever since the very first time I met her, Kusora Yurea has never been someone to judge someone based on their looks. Even when she was out pretending to engage in prostitution, she had, as a matter of fact, judged me not based on my outward appearance. When it comes to her, the criteria upon which she bases her judgement on would be how interesting, or uninteresting beyond saving that person is.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>Completely different from how a normal person would think.<br>If she ever wanted to obtain something, whether it was a well-sculpted handsome man, or a muscle-bound model-like macho man, she&#8217;d be able to obtain any number of them with ease. That was why outer looks were completely meaningless to her.</p>



<p>Wait, why am I thinking about her again? As I shook my head to get rid of all the various random thoughts that kept popping into my mind, I accidentally ended up knocking my ramen bowl with my elbow and spilling all of it onto the floor. Ah, shit. This is all <em>her</em> fault! What a good-for-nothing! With that, the Oba-san hurriedly rushed to the scene. I don&#8217;t know, but her prior gentle expression suddenly seemed to have gone on vacation as her face turned incredibly rugged and stern. Isn&#8217;t that a bit too much for simply wasting a single bowl of ramen by mistake?</p>



<p>When I tried to lend a hand in cleaning it, she swatted my palm away and refused.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m sorry, but could I get another bowl? Of course, I&#8217;ll properly pay for the portion I spilled too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unlike her prior gentleness, she replied really unsociably this time with a simple nod as she swept up the spilled ramen and returned. The change was so night and day that I couldn&#8217;t help but tilt my head in confusion, during which another customer entered.</p>



<p>A woman carrying a long cane. Jet-black hair that was let down just below her shoulders. Her attire too was similarly black. Somewhat dark skinny jeans and a black tee. At a glance, she appeared as though she was coated in a black substance.</p>



<p>With this, she would completely blend into the night, making her difficult to spot in the darkness. Even the sneakers she put on were black. Just how much would one have to love black to cover oneself in their entirety in it?</p>



<p>Her looks were a complete beauty. It seems as though I&#8217;ve been encountering quite a number of beauties lately. Truly an oriental beauty. It suddenly piqued my curiosity, so I decided to take a peek with the scouter.</p>

<p>Higami Miyuna<a id="s2" href="#n2"><sup>[2]</sup></a><br>Age: 27 years<br>Relationship Status: Single<br>Occupation: Solver<a id="s3" href="#n3"><sup>[3]</sup></a><br>Capture Difficulty: C<br>Residence: Tokyo ○○ ○○<br>Phone Number: Inaccessible at current level<br>Capture Information: Fatally risky is approached leisurely. But surprisingly a very simple woman? It&#8217;s also a hobby for her to loiter around in the night streets while undertaking a job. Suffers delusions when it comes to men about 1 to 2 years younger than her. Appeal to her using this factor, if you decide to approach her.<br>Affection Points: 0</p>



<p>Someone with capture information popping up. Am I lucky to be able to find a capture target so easily like this? That too at such late hours. However, I can&#8217;t understand a bit of what the capture information is supposed to mean. But since I&#8217;m already appropriately younger than her, do I tick all the boxes?</p>



<p>Leaving that aside, the oba-san seemed to have frowned again the moment she showed up, after which she brought the remade ramen over. Since she placed it curtly, a bit of the soup ended up splashing out. A complete 180 from her pleasantly smiling face from last time. That&#8217;s really a bit too extreme for simply spilling it once. Although I wasn&#8217;t able to comprehend her thought processes, the ramen was still quite delicious. A broth that tenderly quelled my hunger away, it was indeed magnificent.</p>



<p>As I frantically slurped up my food, I could hear the voice of the girl sitting on the table behind me order a plate of yakitori. Afterwards we had a few moments of peace and quiet. Amidst the quiet food cart, only the sound me slurping my ramen resounded, followed by her commencing her meal as well. As stealthily took a peek at her with a sidelong glance, I found the yakitori gone in a flash.</p>



<p>Suddenly, she stood up from her seat. Seems like she&#8217;s done chowing down. So far, having already finished the noodles, I had been taking my sweet time sipping the broth as I awaited my chance, and finally, now was the time to strike. I immediately started to tail her, clicking save in the vicinity as well.</p>



<p>However, she very quickly vanished from my field of view. I couldn&#8217;t find a single trace of her. This must be thanks to those black clothes of hers. No wait, this isn&#8217;t the time to marvel at her. Deftly, I equipped myself with the &#8216;Glasses&#8217;.</p>



<p>It was an item that makes my field of view light up like daytime even if it was as dark as the night. I never imagined I&#8217;d be using it to tail someone, but it was the perfect time to make use of this guy. After blinking consecutively, its effects activated. And after I kept my eyes closed for a relatively long time, the vision returned to that of the original darkness.</p>



<p>Having gotten the gist of how it&#8217;s used, I immediately commenced my pursuit. Although it wasn&#8217;t really as aggressive as a &#8216;pursuit&#8217;. A simple &#8216;trailing&#8217; would be more appropriate.</p>



<p>With the item activated, I could finally spot her clearly a good distance away. Carefully, I proceeded to follow along. And after seemingly walking straight forwards for a while, she suddenly took a turn and disappeared into an alleyway. I panicked and rushed in as well, to my surprise, there wasn&#8217;t anybody there. There was a concrete wall in my way, or in other words, a dead end. It was right then that I got a sudden sense of discomfort surge up my body.</p>

<p>« Choice 1: Look around the alleyway a bit more. »<br>« Choice 2: Leave the alleyway. »</p>



<p>By now, I had even grown accustomed to this kind of situation. For now, I went with the second option. I also kinda get the feeling that she wasn&#8217;t really in this alleyway. It was dark so it&#8217;s possible I was mistaken somewhere. Wait, I had the glasses on that time, so then, why? Either way, it didn&#8217;t seem like she was there, so might as well try leaving. Once my body regained its freedom after making my choice, even after feeling around other nearby alleyways, her whereabouts were nowhere to be found.&nbsp;</p>



<p>An odd feeling. So… it wasn&#8217;t really a mistake. No matter how I look at it, she disappeared in the same alleyway as where the choices appeared. There&#8217;s no way the choices would show up for no reason. I gave it a go once again. I checked the alleyway I entered the first time. But as expected, there was nobody. My only company was the moonlight beaming down on me.</p>



<p>Not only that, but the choices didn&#8217;t appear again either. In that case, I have no choice but to walk away. It can&#8217;t be helped. I drearily loaded back, after which I made sure to follow her quickly this time, hurriedly entering the same alleyway as soon as she slipped in.</p>



<p>« Choice 1: Look around the alleyway a bit more. »<br>« Choice 2: Leave the alleyway. »</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.3</strong></p>

<p>Fuhaha, shit. You made me waste 500,000 ¥ for nothing. Complaining all on my own, I chose the first option this time. And following the words in the option, I went further in. However, there was nothing to be seen. This giant wall was the only thing in this alleyway. Getting irritated, just when I thought of turning back and heading out, a sharp pain rushed up my back</p>



<p>I instinctively screamed and collapsed right there. The sensation of death came over me. The same as when I got run over by the car. A sensation of my back completely burning up. It seemed as though I was about to lose consciousness. I wanted to take a look behind me, but I didn&#8217;t have the luxury to take that chance. I mustered every ounce of my adrenaline induced strength to trigger the &#8216;Load&#8217; screen and unhesitantly clicked on the terminal. What followed was the ever so familiar transformation into the white world.</p>



<p>This was already the second time I loaded in such a short time.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuu…&#8221;</p>



<p>Recalling the feeling of getting stabbed in the back, I took deep breaths and regained my composure. There was no more pain. But the feeling remained vividly engraved into my brain.</p>



<p>What the hell is this?<br>Are both the choices wrong?</p>



<p>After having loaded back, as I tried to endure the remaining painful sensation, she had already disappeared from sight. Was she intending to enter the same alleyway from last time? I would&#8217;ve tried heading there as well, but I had already lost sight of her. I have no idea what&#8217;s going on anymore!</p>



<p>However, at that moment…<br>A pain rushed up my back again. An even more intense pain from last time.<br>A kitchen knife. This was most definitely a kitchen knife. A slightly larger variant from regular home knives had tore into my abdomen.</p>



<p>The pain… was beyond my imagination. I felt like I would faint right then and there. Literally every inch of my body was screaming death out to me.</p>


<p>With a quivering hand, I summoned the &#8216;Load&#8217; screen again. Willing myself to stay alive before my consciousness went somewhere far away, I clicked it. I was unable to see the perpetrator this time as well. If I bothered doing that, I&#8217;d have lost strength in my arm and become unable to click the terminal, leaving me in the embrace of an eternal slumber.</p>



<p>With that said, the load point this time was before the cart as well.<br>Ugh, I&#8217;m so done with this shit. The hell is up with this infinite loop! It&#8217;s as if I fell into an endless labyrinth of death!<br>I wonder if I really did accidentally enter such a place.<br>This was indeed, most definitely a labyrinth of the night streets.<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>



<p>Anyways, I started running again. But this time, earnestly keeping an eye out for my surroundings.<br>The alleyway came into view in no time.<br>Yeah, this was definitely the same dimly lit place where I got stabbed by something sharp as I stood still. I wasn&#8217;t bothering much with my surroundings at the time. That&#8217;s why, this time, I made sure to stay alert in all four directions. I even used the glasses again.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>But nevertheless, there was no sign of any other existence around me.</p>



<p>Hmm, let&#8217;s try backing up a bit here. The first time the choices came up was when I immediately started to chase her.<br>And then I loaded back.<br>And after that, thanks to a wrong choice, I got stabbed in the back.<br>And then I loaded back again.<br>And at the time, thanks to almost falling unconscious due to the pain of getting stabbed before I loaded, I was already too late in chasing after her. Without thinking much about it, as I pondered on various stuff and made my way to the alley again, I got stabbed by something like a kitchen knife.</p>

<p>I wonder if there&#8217;s something special about this time difference in time between the events.</p>



<p>The first death was in the alleyway.<br>The second was right in front of it.</p>



<p>Doubts tingled my spine, together with the cold than down it. Just where exactly was I stepping on what kinds of flags? Did I unintentionally trap myself from all sides with death flags? A situation where I didn&#8217;t die on its own was the lucky route. If I get my head sliced off, then it would be a bad end then and there. Or should I say… a &#8216;dead&#8217; end?</p>



<p>The second time was incredibly painful. I don&#8217;t ever want to experience that again. The sensation from that time can&#8217;t be described with mere words. In particular, the pain from having such a tool plunge into you is unimaginable. Even now, my head is throbbing from it. This is too cruel. But no matter how I felt, I kept on walking ahead again. That&#8217;s because if I stay still for too long, something would definitely end up happening.</p>



<p>As I did so, I finally came across the alleyway again. The alley where I got stabbed, and also where the choices appeared. Whatever the case, this is where that woman disappeared into. The secret definitely lies somewhere here. But even so, both of the choices were a miss.</p>



<p>And then, it was time. Just as I set foot into the alley just a little bit, the choices appeared. However, among the choices that had all too gotten used to seeing, an additional option sprung up.</p>



<p>« Choice 1: Look around the alleyway a bit more. »<br>« Choice 2: Leave the alleyway. »<br>« Choice 3: Look up. »</p>



<p>A third choice had strangely appeared.</p>



<p>Is this where the correct option finally appears after having overcome death? But what if this was a trap as well? Yeah, I bet there aren&#8217;t any correct ones anyway. But that doesn&#8217;t mean I&#8217;d pick the same options again after failing with them already. If I do, I&#8217;d be going around the infinite loop again. That&#8217;s why I decided to go for option 3.</p>



<p>Just as the choice stated, I looked up. The moonlight illuminated the dark night streets. As the drifting clouds moved away, the moon became clearer. And it was exactly then when I discovered the woman standing atop the wall, glaring down at me. Even though she wasn&#8217;t before. But of course, it&#8217;s only to be expected that I&#8217;d notice her if I simply looked up. I&#8217;m not that big of an idiot.</p>



<img src="https://i0.wp.com/hinjakuhonyaku.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/f1ee296d257338755315bb8b41b6d3caf809e96cc78c68fb255c1c3003a63467.png?resize=722%2C1024&#038;ssl=1"></img>


<p>It was exactly now that she suddenly got on top of the wall and stood glaring down at me.<br>So this was the power of the third option.</p>



<p>She drew her cane without uttering a single word, revealing a long sword in her hand. It wasn&#8217;t anything like a kitchen knife. It was a legitimate sword that would be used by actual warriors. Although an insipid one without any kind of decorations, it looked incredibly sharp. If that&#8217;s the case, then it was clearly this thing that stabbed me from choosing the first option. The place was also right here.</p>



<p>&#8220;H-Hey… wait a minute!&#8221;</p>



<p>The woman suddenly faced me and brandished her cane-sword. The hell is up with her, this homicidal maniac! She seemed like she&#8217;d chase after me no matter where I ran.</p>



<p>In the end, the only way to survive was through the items.<br>I didn&#8217;t want to get stabbed again. Thanks, but I&#8217;d gladly pass up the opportunity to feel that pain again.</p>



<p>The sleep spray? Its range was quite excessive. As my mind raced, pondering on my options, the bottommost item in the list came into view. The &#8216;Formless Sword&#8217;. This is it. The &#8216;Formless Sword&#8217; that I had yet to even try once.</p>



<p>This was the perfect opportunity to test it out.</p>



<p>« Would you like to use the Formless Sword? »</p>



<p><em>Click!</em></p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.4</strong></p>

<p>I bought this item with the intention of defending my body in times of facing Kusora, but to think that I&#8217;d end up using it in an incident like this. Anyway, since the item isn&#8217;t capable of being effective during a surprise attack, so I wouldn&#8217;t be able to avoid death just because I use it. However, now was a pretty good situation. The activated &#8216;Formless Sword&#8217; was able to completely parry her sharp, very real sword off. However, I couldn&#8217;t see anything in my hands. It was formless, exactly as stated. A sword without any material form.</p>



<p>An unexpected class of swords.<br>That too of incredibly high expertise.<br>The exchanges continued on for some time. And soon enough, she finally stopped her movements, and started to speak with her sword pointed towards me.</p>



<p>&#8220;What… exactly are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was an unbelievable face. Living up to her sword skills, there was clear and absolute confidence in her eyes. It was indeed true that her abilities weren&#8217;t that of an amateur. They were sharp strikes that one would see on TV or movies. Definitely not one of those reckless hacking procedures. Firm and disciplined sword arts. Is it from some famous school somewhere…?</p>



<p>To think that there&#8217;d be earnest swordsmanship being practised in the 21ˢᵗ century. We&#8217;re not even in some kind of kendo hall right now. Isn&#8217;t this simply an unlaughabe homicide?</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you think it&#8217;s necessary for me to answer such a question to a serial killer?&#8221;</p>



<p>I made my rebuttal with false pretext, following which, the woman knit her eyebrows and replied.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who are you calling a serial killer?&#8221;</p>



<p>How shameless. Even though she looks like she&#8217;d be any second even now. I magnificently replied back. Since I currently have the Formless Sword, I&#8217;m feeling kinda confident.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you, who suddenly flourished your sword out of nowhere are not a serial killer, then what, am I the one who is?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What about the part where <em>you</em> were targeting and tailing after me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>At my dumbfounded expression, the woman sheathed her sword back in her cane-like scabbard. Fortunately, it seems like she was thinking there was some kind of misunderstanding.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then why were you loitering around this area?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s… erm… I was trying to… pick you up…&#8221;</p>



<p>Rather than giving her some weird misunderstanding, it seemed like it was better to tell her the truth. That&#8217;s why I confessed outright. And that was when an expression appeared onto her face. Till now, it was nothing but blank and indifferent.</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>For some time, the two of us simply stared at each other in silence.</p>



<p>&#8220;You… Are you mocking me right now?&#8221;</p>



<p>Getting angry, she once again drew her sword and commenced her flurries. And of course, having no choice, I continued to defend against her attacks with the Formless Sword I had yet to cancel. The dull battle continued for some time until I was starting to get tired from it. It was the same for her.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>&#8220;Why aren&#8217;t you attacking me? What are your intentions?&#8221;</p>



<p>Because I simply <em>can&#8217;t</em> attack you. That&#8217;s an item that can&#8217;t do anything but defend. Now that I think about it, she doesn&#8217;t seem to be fazed at there being a sword she&#8217;s unable to see. It can&#8217;t be that other people can actually see it, right? Am I the only one who can&#8217;t see it? I thought about asking her about it, but then I realized I&#8217;d look like an idiot so I gave up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Like I said, I was really just trying to pick you up.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You were just… so pretty, that I…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>She seemed to have shuddered a little at my words. As if it was the first time she ever heard those words.</p>



<p>&#8220;What you said just now…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Those words… Do you really mean them?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;About me intending to pick you up? Of course it is.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, I… don&#8217;t mean that…!&#8221;</p>



<p>She had suddenly become really meek and stuttered in her words. Just what happened?</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s… Come on… About me… A-Am I really pretty?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ah, now I see. Girl, have you never seen yourself in the mirror?</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. I do think so, though?&#8221;</p>



<p>She sheathed her sword following those words. She looks like she&#8217;s in a really good mood, or am I simply hallucinating?</p>



<p>&#8220;Is… Is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>She stood there silently looking at me for some time, but started to speak again.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s… the first time I was ever told that. No, wait… Just what am I saying all of a sudden? U-Umm… I-I&#8217;ll forgive you for tailing me this whole time, so… you should just return home.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, she dashed up the wall. Standing there, she stared down at me for some time. Her long hair fluttered in the wind. I didn&#8217;t notice it before, but… as she stood up there with the moonlight shining down on her, it gave her quite the mystical air about her. Without getting a chance to say anything, she jumped off the wall and disappeared into the house on the other side.</p>



<p>I had already taken the first step forward. The mission had already begun. Meaning, I had no way of giving up. I can&#8217;t have myself obediently return home like that. I <em>really</em> wanted to know her objective already. Why did she enter a stranger&#8217;s house during a moonlit night? Could it be that it has some kind of connection to the mission?</p>



<p>I left the alleyway and boldly stood in front of the house gate. And summoned what had already become an indispensable item, the &#8216;Master Key&#8217;.</p>



<p>As the gate opened and I entered, I beheld a mansion before me. Judging from its size, it must belong to a considerably rich person. I&#8217;d enter the entryway, but I ended up having to use the &#8216;Master Key&#8217; again to enter. Finally, the entryway. It was really quiet inside. I couldn&#8217;t find any sign of the woman from before either. I thought of using the glasses once again, but stopped. The Formless Sword might not be able to defend against surprise attacks, but as long as I can manage to hinder the first attack, it should be able to defend against the rest. Yeah, wouldn&#8217;t it be a better choice to keep this equipped rather than the glasses? It was already confirmed that I can&#8217;t activate two items at the same time, but in the end, my choice would be to use the Formless Sword.</p>



<p>Fortunately, the clouds had moved away from obstructing the moonlight, so the inside of the house was no longer covered in darkness. With that said, I continued forwards. But at that moment, I suddenly heard a sound from the second floor. Once I reached upstairs, I found the dead body of a plump oji-san with his neck sliced by the sword-wielding woman from before.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hiyeh!&#8221;</p>



<p>I stepped back a bit in surprise. It was scene of a murder case. But it was then that the woman came attacking me once again. The Formless Sword parried her attacks accordingly. I know I kept it activated, but god damn. The woman then took a good look at my face and spoke.</p>


<p>&#8220;You again?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I was curious as to why you entered this house so I got in as well, but…&#8221;</p>



<p>I wonder how she managed to enter. As I surveyed our surroundings, I found my answer. A window that looked like it had been cleanly sliced off by a sharp tool. No wonder she was able to get it, fumu fumu.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just now, you killed someone, didn&#8217;t you? Why is that? Even though you denied being a serial killer?&#8221;</p>



<p>Before the corpse that continued to drain blood, she cleanly sheathed her sword back, proceeding to answer me as if I asked something incredibly pointless.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a solver. Different from a serial killer that harbors no purpose.&#8221;</p>



<p>She said so with her chest puffed up with pride. If you ask me, it didn&#8217;t seem that different, though… But anyways, it would seem as though a solver is someone who takes requests from someone. That&#8217;s what appeared in the scouter too.</p>



<p>&#8220;Phew, so anyway, when it comes to accepting requests, is anyone qualified?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not correct.&#8221;</p>



<p>Looks like she also has her own standards to abide by, resulting in her glaring at my words.</p>



<p>&#8220;I only accept requests from individuals whose reasons I deem properly justified. This man right here is in truth, a politician. He demolished a certain area completely in order to start an impossible development project. Everybody in that area would lose their homes. Even though it&#8217;s temporary, where do you think the people who lost everything have ended up? From people living in the streets, there have also been people who took their own lives. However, my justification was not based on that reason. On top of proceeding to force the development of an impossible project, many of the inhabitants who opposed it have mysteriously died. The daughter of such a person made the request and it&#8217;s in order to exact her revenge that I have decided to point my blade at the target.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So basically, it&#8217;s an action based on some kind &#8216;ally of justice&#8217;?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No. It&#8217;s simply that she happened to move my heart. There is no such thing as &#8216;justice&#8217; in my actions. The only thing I have is the faith in my blade. But rather than that, just how did you manage to enter this place? I didn&#8217;t hear any sound.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I have my methods.&#8221;</p>



<p>Towards me shrugging alongside my words, she spoke with faint surprise.</p>



<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be that you&#8217;re in the same line, are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not quite. I don&#8217;t murder others.&#8221;</p>



<p>After hearing her circumstances, I especially didn&#8217;t feel like criticizing her act of killing. I&#8217;ve been coming across corpses quite regularly these days. I didn&#8217;t want to get used to these kinds of situations, but I ended up getting used to them anyway. No, what&#8217;s important right now is the game captures, not murders.</p>



<p>&#8220;Leaving that aside, you seemed to have achieved your goal, so shall we head on outside?&#8221;</p>



<p>She nodded at my words. And thus the two of us returned to the night streets again.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.5</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;By the way, are you sure we aren&#8217;t in the same line of operations? It&#8217;s been quite a while since I met someone who can repel my sword.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Umm, I… was just a passerby?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her eyebrows perked up as if she didn&#8217;t like my answer.</p>



<p>&#8220;My abilities with the sword aren&#8217;t really that good. Even the technique itself is focussed on defense and has no offensive aspects at all.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was then that she finally seemed to have caught on and nodded in understanding. It was actually the abilities of the item and incapable of offensive moves, but did I slip out anything along those lines?</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, I see, so that&#8217;s what it is. It&#8217;s that you&#8217;re completely incapable of attacking, is it? That sword style is pretty half-baked.</p>



<p>&#8220;That would be the case, wouldn&#8217;t it.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was a harsh criticism but not off the mark, so I couldn&#8217;t let out a single rebuttal. But more importantly, at this rate, it seems like I&#8217;ll be naturally parting away from her like this, so I&#8217;m in quite the trouble. I had to make ourselves go on a tangent somehow or another, thus I started to think over possible methods. It&#8217;s out of the question that we&#8217;d be seprataring after this conversation at this rate. The fact that the mission is such where I must absolutely capture her, it&#8217;d be a severe setback if I let it slip.</p>



<p>Hmm, how should I hold her back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, would you like to have a bite at the cart from back then? I got hungry again thanks to you. You know, after the whole sudden assault and whatnot.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Your actions were so suspicious, I had no choice but to attack you. Fuu, alright. As an apology, I&#8217;ll treat you.&#8221;</p>



<p>She nodded her head with vigour. And so we returned to the cart we first met. That was also my starting point, so I thought of saving there again. I really want to free myself from this labyrinth of death and since I managed to slip out of it somehow, why not.</p>



<p>Just as usual, the cart was being managed by the oba-san. There were no other customers in sight. The two of us, who previously sat in different places, now sat together at the same table.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll have a yakitori, what about you?&#8221;</p>



<p>She had yakitori last time too, so she must really like it, right. In that case, I&#8217;ll get ramen too. There were no other items on the menu that I liked as much.</p>



<p>&#8220;You came here a while ago too, didn&#8217;t you Onii-san? And now it&#8217;s two of you, hmm?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what the oba-san said as she brought the food over. I laughed to hide my embarrassment. And on the other hand, <em>she</em> completely ignored the oba-san&#8217;s words and silently started to eat away. What an interesting woman. Last time when I spilled the ramen, she got incredibly pissed, but once I came back, she seemed to be all smiles again. How fickle, she and her emotions.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>At that moment, I stood up feeling thirsty and called for her. She was busy cutting up veggies with a kitchen knife.</p>



<p>&#8220;Excuse me, a glass of water please.&#8221;</p>



<p>Following my words, she reached for the jug nearby and brought it over. And at that moment, at the same table where she took the jug from, the kitchen knife that she placed seemed to look familiar. I don&#8217;t know why, but it was this murky feeling of having seen it somewhere before. As I returned to my seat, she continued to stare at me, and it was by then that I the feeling slipped away from me as I remembered the capture information. It was the perfect situation. There was something regarding delusions about juniors, wasn&#8217;t there? I don&#8217;t know how such a thing would help in the mission, but I tried to appeal to it for the time being.</p>



<p>&#8220;Excuse me, but… your name? How should I address you…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am Higami Miyuna.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m Hasegawa Ryou.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Right.&#8221;</p>



<p>She nodded. The conversation seemed to be reaching a stop, so I tried appealing with my age.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m 25.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh? You&#8217;re… younger than me?&#8221;</p>



<p>And she immediately bit down the bait. Her eyes seemed to be sparkling.</p>



<p>&#8220;How old are you, Higami-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m 27. But for real, I assumed you&#8217;d be older than me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m 25 though…&#8221;</p>



<p>I ended up slipping my tongue and responding in a muddy tone, making her laugh. But that didn&#8217;t seem one of ridicule. It was simply a pure smile. From the looks of it, I&#8217;m not sure if she would&#8217;ve readily accepted me by now if I had prioritized my charm points a bit more, but perhaps, it&#8217;s also possible that her standards for looks were peculiar as well. If Kusora&#8217;s standards were about how dull someone is, were her standards about how strong one is?</p>



<p>Whatever it may be, since she seemed in good spirits, I decided to do a quick check on her affection points.</p>




<p>Higami Miyuna<br>Age: 27 years<br>Relationship Status: Single<br>Occupation: Solver<br>Capture Difficulty: C<br>Address: Tokyo ☐☐ ☐☐<br>Phone Number: Inaccessible at current level<br>Capture Information: Fatally risky if approached leisurely. But surprisingly a very simple woman? It’s also a hobby for her to loiter around in the night streets while undertaking a job. Suffers delusions when it comes to men about 1 to 2 years younger than her. Appeal to her using this factor, if you decide to approach her.<br>Affection Points: 60</p>



<p>Hoh~, if 100 is the maximum, then isn&#8217;t this really good? Since simply bumping into one&#8217;s shoulder was enough to once bring the points to negative values, seeing this right now makes me really satisfied. Of course the affection points didn&#8217;t have a direct connection to the mission based on how everything has played out till now, even so, she&#8217;s quite the beauty. I have absolutely no complaints.</p>



<p>However, surely, it was at that moment that a sense of numbness started to take hold of my body. The sensation of paralysis. Moreover, it seemed to be happening to Higami-san as well. I immediately turned towards the cart lady. And that&#8217;s when I saw her staring at us in ridicule.</p>



<p>Absurd. This is too absurd.<br>I steadily moved my finger. Using every last bit of my strength, I carried it over towards the load button. If I get completely paralyzed at this rate, I won&#8217;t be able to show her my cool side anymore.</p>



<p>And thus, once again, in front of the cart.<br>Beside me, stood Higami-san.</p>

<p>I entered the cart with her like this, and played out everything the same way as before. This time however, I didn&#8217;t taste the food. That was the only thing different. The reason for getting paralyzed is the cooking no matter how one thinks of it. And of course it goes to say that the water that only I drank was not the cause at all.</p>



<p>Suddenly the whole cart started to feel very suspicious to me. Now that I mention it, I haven&#8217;t seen any other customer other than us. Normally it wouldn&#8217;t be strange for at least one two drunkards to show up every now and then. If not then then it wouldn&#8217;t really be a profitable business, would it. Leaving the strange things aside, even the ground had weird stains all over it, now that I look at it.</p>



<p>However, the contents of our conversations were the same. That&#8217;s right, this was exactly when the paralysis took place. And just as one would imagine, Higami-san made an odd expression and fell under the table just like that. There&#8217;s something in the food, then it&#8217;s obvious that the owner of the cart would be the most suspicious. The figure of her ridiculing face from before the load left a deep impression in my mind.</p>



<p>And on top of that, the kitchen knife. It was by this time that I was convinced of it, but… it&#8217;s obvious that that was the thing that stabbed into my stomach.</p>



<p>The first was Higami-san&#8217;s sword.<br>That misunderstanding was resolved.<br>But after thinking about it, the second time was different. Whatever the case, the weapons were different.<br>The tool on the second time was, unlike Higami-san&#8217;s full-fledged sword, much shorter.</p>



<p>But now, shooting up in surprise, I quickly held her feeble and pained figure and sat her down onto the chair.</p>



<p>&#8220;Higami-san! Are you alright?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me… you…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, you&#8217;re wrong! Although I didn&#8217;t take a bite as we talked, it&#8217;s definitely not me. It must&#8217;ve been someone else who spiked the food…&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s when Higami-san somehow managed to turn her head towards the middle-aged woman and glared at her. And of course, the same goes for me. However, the oba-san grasped onto the knife ahead of me and slowly started to tread closer.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh dear, just one of you ate the food, eh?&#8221;<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>



<p>And so she started to approach me. <s>Instead of running away, she was coming right to me.<a id="s2" href="#n2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></s> Somehow, with a quick movement, I managed to dodge her swing onto the surface of the table. We were in a desperately perilous situation. If I didn&#8217;t have the items, I might never be able to win a one-on-one against this lady. Ugh, I&#8217;m so miserable.</p>



<p>&#8220;My… my sword…&#8221;</p>



<p>As though the drug only paralyzed her without taking away her consciousness, she weakly said so with her upper body languidly sprawled over the table. But the distance&nbsp; from her sword was still quite far. The knife came at me once again, but this time, raised and threw the table that was laid out; and immediately read through my owned items.</p>



<p>« Would you like to use the Formless Sword? »</p>



<p>However, before I could click it, the woman lunged at me once again. That when my mind switched. The Formless Sword is something that would repel attacks anyway. The woman kept getting closer and closer. I tried taking a backstep and after having thought of using the sword, I got rid of the terminal screen and returned to my owned items, this time clicking on &#8216;Sleep Spray&#8217;.</p>



<p>« Would you like to use the Sleep Spray? »</p>



<p>The distance between me and the oba-san was but a head&#8217;s width away. An instant before getting stabbed. I panicked and clicked the message that instant. And immediately, she fell asleep, the knife in her hand falling to the ground as she lost her strength.</p>



<p>Phew, is this where raising my constitution would&#8217;ve been better? It&#8217;s still a long way to level up, and there&#8217;s also plenty of ability points to raise. But anyways, I stood back up. I can&#8217;t stay here for the whole duration of the paralysis, so I carried Higami-san on my back, grabbed her cane-sword which I camouflaged into a rolled up bedsheet<a id="s3" href="#n3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> and slipped out of the cart.</p>



<p>And so, I returned back into the politician&#8217;s home that I had intruded upon using the &#8216;Master Key&#8217; the other time. There were a whole bunch of corpses on the second floor so I kinda got the shivers, but since it was good that I didn&#8217;t have to waste another key usage, there was no other choice. I fumbled around the first floor after lowering her onto the sofa, but it seemed like there was no other family member around. I thought of using the &#8216;Sleep Spray&#8217; on them if they existed, but it wasn&#8217;t necessary.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just where did all the members of this house go that the politician had to be left alone here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.5</strong></p>

<p>Fumu. It was kinda weird, but the fact that nobody returned even so late into the night would mean that assuming it&#8217;s a vacant house was still sound.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you still feel like you can&#8217;t move?&#8221;</p>



<p>To my question, she somehow mustered up.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes…&#8221;</p>



<p>Without helping it, I sat down on the floor beside her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Even so, thank you very much…&#8221;</p>



<p>As I did, she uttered words of gratitude. And continuing on, also an apology.</p>



<p>&#8220;Honestly, at first I was suspecting that you&#8217;re the one who had the paralysis drug. I&#8217;m sorry… for trusting you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s alright. But do you trust me now?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Yes!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Haha.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her eyes seemed to be glittering with stars. They looked incredibly pretty to me. Adding on those pretty eyes, those sexy lips of hers. My chest suddenly started to pound strongly.</p>



<p>I kept getting weird thoughts as I continued to stare at her, so pretended to hum and naturally averted my gaze away. We passed the time with meaningless chatter. I don&#8217;t know how long it had been, but at one point I felt movement on the sofa behind me, so I turned my line of sight to her once again. Seeing her, it seemed the paralysis had worn off and she was moving herself albeit sluggishly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Has the numbness worn off?&#8221;</p>




<p>At my inquiry, she made a vigorous nod. She seemed to be completely healed.</p>



<p>&#8220;You see, it&#8217;s this kind of thing. Hasegawa-san, I&#8217;m… the type of person who immediately repays her debt, so I&#8217;d like to do something for you, but…&#8221;</p>



<p>She got closer to me as she said so. As the moonlight entered through the window and reflected off her face, I suddenly felt like I would choke in my own breath. I ended up wanting those lips.</p>



<p>And at that instant, I succumbed to my impulses. A pure and raw impulse. The relatively high affection points and her bringing up words of repayment had lighted up some courage in me.</p>



<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case, then…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;C-Could you give me a kiss?&#8221;</p>



<p>The sound of a large ball of saliva being gulped. Yes, I suddenly wanted to experience a kiss. Higami-san, surprised, took a step back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Suddenly asking for a kiss is…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What about returning the favor?&#8221;</p>




<p>She was bewildered.<br>Since I had already said it, I tried to come out strong.</p>



<p>&#8220;A kiss is just a form of greeting. Yes, a greeting.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That might be, but… Ah, I guess I <em>have</em> kissed my brother before. S-So… it&#8217;s like that, huh. But… But I did mention returning the favor, so…&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if my words were able to go across, but she stood there having her own monologue for some time.<br>It felt like her eyes were spinning dizzily.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>To think that saying a kiss was a greeting would get across to her. Isn&#8217;t her common sense a bit too lacking?<br>I wonder if she completely cut herself off from this world in order to learn the sword.<br>Hahah.</p>



<p>For some reason, I stopped caring. And thus, as if being possessed by something I approached Higami-san, grabbed her body and in accordance to my previous announcement, pressed my lips onto hers.</p>



<p>As I did, she pushed me away strongly.</p>



<p>&#8220;H-Hey, wait!&#8221;</p>



<p>Higami-san&#8217;s face turned bright red.<br>Since I got the feeling that she was somewhat angry, I instinctively started to make excuses. Even if I told her to treat it as repayment, it wasn&#8217;t a good enough excuse, so I tried using complements this time.</p>



<p>&#8220;What can I do, Higami-san is just so pretty.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh…? What? Pretty? Even if you said that twice till now… you&#8217;re a liar!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You call me a liar, but all I did was state what&#8217;s true. Are you telling me you had no idea?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m… not pretty at all…&#8221;</p>



<p>Unbelievable words came out of her mouth. Just how has she been raised till now? Was she brought up in the mountains thinking of nothing but the ways of the sword? Somehow… the fact that it sounds entirely possible is terrifying in and of itself. Whatever the case, I pressed her down once again in order to quench my own thirst.</p>



<p>Her resistance seemed to have weakened to some extent, so I continued and connected our lips. She didn&#8217;t turn me down this time. This was the first time that a woman truly accepted me on her own rather than due to wanting to use me. That&#8217;s why, perhaps… I might&#8217;ve wanted to create as many memories as I could like this.</p>



<p>Of course this was just me acting on my own, having absolutely no connection to the capture mission whatsoever. It was simply me trying to make memories.</p>



<p>As I thought about those things, that was when I built up a strong resolve and proceeded to stick my into her mouth. If this is a one-time opportunity to create memories, then I want to kiss properly. Once I did, her body twitched and trembled in surprise. Looks like she wasn&#8217;t more experienced than I was. I parted from her lips and said.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, this is normal. Isn&#8217;t Higami-san a bit too engrossed in your sword and lacking in experience?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But… the tongue? T-That&#8217;s dirty.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Like I said back then, a kiss is just a form of greeting. All the westerners do this. Since this had the repayment factor mixed in, I simply made it more grandiose, that&#8217;s all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s… It&#8217;s the first time I&#8217;m hearing such a thing… Kya!&#8221;</p>



<p>Of course, there&#8217;s no questioning that it&#8217;s a lie.<br>No matter how much westerners might greet each other with a kiss, there&#8217;s no way they&#8217;d suddenly stick their tongue in.<br>But even this was able to get across to her.<br>It&#8217;s as I suspected, she&#8217;s lacking common sense.</p>



<p>As I continued to pressure her, Higami-san closed her eyes once again. Thus, our kiss-time resumed. We quelled our lust with our tongues intertwining each other for some time, and as a bridge of saliva was created connecting our now separated lips, she seemed to appear even more sexy. If it&#8217;s a kiss, I&#8217;ve done it with Sakurai too. To think that my first kiss was with a woman like that.</p>



<img src="https://i0.wp.com/hinjakuhonyaku.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ore.no_.Genjitsu.wa_.Renai_.Game_...full_.2735160-1.jpg?resize=721%2C1024&#038;ssl=1"></img>


<p>After we were done, an awkward atmosphere lingered among us. The gap between her embarrassed retreating figure and her sword wielding figure could be clearly felt. That too was cute about her. It was just that she was a bit too embarrassed.</p>



<p>For the time being, I continued to stare at her after our lips separated. And following that, with a face full of embarrassment, she looked away and nonchalantly distanced herself from me. The air turned awkward in an instant. I tried diverting our attention away by getting into the main topic at the moment. It was, in fact, a very important matter. It&#8217;s possible that the capture mission has something to do with it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Incidentally, what was up with that food cart?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was wondering if the capture was successful after I managed to make the oba-san collapse, but when I checked my status, there weren&#8217;t any changes. Even Higami-san who was in the middle of her keeping away with embarrassment changed into a serious expression as soon as my words entered her ears. I bet she&#8217;s also pretty frustrated about being fed a paralysis drug.</p>



<p>&#8220;Certainly! To think that she used a paralysis drug, how preposterous!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Moreover, doesn&#8217;t this house seem a little strange to you? Would you like to snoop around and check?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, let&#8217;s!&#8221;</p>



<p>Seemingly thinking the same thing as I was, in contrast to her previous self, she carried an earnest expression as she started to snoop around. The strangest part was that it didn&#8217;t seem like there was any kind of day-to-day lifestyle having taken place. The kitchen did have a dishwasher included in it, but it didn&#8217;t have the feeling of being used. There was not even a single piece of photo or decoration that one would usually find in a normal household. Based on the experience I&#8217;ve accumulated so far, I already understood that the existence of a photo is very important. The fact that there weren&#8217;t any photos in this house is most certainly suspicious.</p>



<p>Moving on, we checked inside the fridge. It was empty. It was as spotless as a completely unused appliance. Very, <em>very</em> suspicious. At that moment, I suddenly recalled the weird stains back at the food cart. That place was suspicious, and so was this. But more than anything, the fact that I simply left the oba-san asleep back there, unattended, was weighing down on my mind.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.6</strong></p>

<p>For the time being, I searched for Hikami-san, but I couldn&#8217;t find her because she went to check the second floor.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hikami-san! I&#8217;m gonna go check out the food stall!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yelling loudly enough to be audible on the second floor, I ran outside. I should have taken measures to hand over the oba-san to the cops, but leaving it as it was, it was weighing down on me. For some reason, it was making me shudder, so I made a run for it, calling upon the &#8216;Formless Sword&#8217; and equipping it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>By the time I got to the food stall, I was already out of breath. However, I did not need to defend. Because the food stall itself had disappeared without leaving a single trace. Thinking I got the wrong place, I got closer to the area. However, the weird stains on the ground were all that remained.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Taking a closer look, it looks like a bloodstain no matter how you look at it. At a glance, you can see red color being reflected. But it&#8217;s still odd. It was only that one oba-san at the stall. And the &#8216;Sleep Spray&#8217; is effective for about 3 hours. It was still impossible for her to wake up. But if so, that would mean there&#8217;s another person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As expected, is this mission about uncovering the truth of this stall along with Hikami-san?&nbsp;</p>



<p>The oba-san I left sleeping disappeared along with the stall.<br>Rather than poison, a paralytic drug&#8230; Why bother with the risk of such a thing?<br>And why didn&#8217;t she use it the first time I went into the stall alone?<br>Why did she use it only when I went with Hikami-san?<br>And where did she disappear to?<br>What on earth does this bloodstain mean?<br>Why doesn&#8217;t the politician&#8217;s house feel like it&#8217;s been lived in?<br>The house and the food stall don&#8217;t seem to have anything to do with each other, but both are pretty suspicious.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nothing&#8217;s adding up. This is way too complicated. I&#8217;m confident that if all of these questions are answered, the capture mission related to Hikami-san will also be solved. Besides this, however, the situation is like a labyrinth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I surveyed the surroundings, I could see her approaching as if she was running late. Seems like she heard my voice and followed me. When I was about to say that she didn&#8217;t have to go along with me, my phone suddenly started ringing. Consequently, I pulled it out.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Tiririririri!</em></p>



<p>A private number. Who could it be at such a time? I was curious, so I received it for the time being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why were you so late? Are you aware of the story of the dead man who was late in answering the phone? &#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The hell would I know that. Dying just because he was late to answer the phone&#8230; It&#8217;s too miserable! There&#8217;s only one person I know who can spout such an absurd story. I also have that voice well-engraved into me.&nbsp;</p>


<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>The other party was a woman I gravely wanted to call a Great Demon King of Terror. I wanted to hang up that instant, but it goes without saying that it was physically impossible.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8230; What business do you have this late at night?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I panicked for a moment and ended up fumbling my words.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t I say I was nocturnal?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I heard her say in a slightly rough voice. But still, I replied to those words like an idiot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, but&#8230; it&#8217;s my time to sleep though &#8230;?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;re *not* sleeping right now.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t you think I could&#8217;ve gotten up thanks to the sound of the phone?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;So? Even so, you *have* to get up and answer my call, of course. Do I have to call you at your convenience? Stop spouting such dull things. &#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, yes. Of course that&#8217;s the case. Why does this ojou-sama have to irritate me to the point of calling me? But the fact that I can&#8217;t magnificently tell her to stop fooling around also makes me quite pathetic.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, what do you need?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oji-chan, isn&#8217;t your tone a bit too rude considering that I&#8217;m going as far as giving you a call?&#8221; I do hate dull people, but I hate people who don&#8217;t know their place even more.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;May I ask you why you called me?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As soon as I changed my tone, Kusora spoke in a fairly low voice.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;That line is&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>What the hell does this shitty woman want me to say? I&#8217;m trying my best to put up with the boiling feelings of wanting to straight-up curse at her. I&#8217;m about to go crazy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m in a serious situation right now. I beg you, just tell me only what you want. I&#8217;m really busy.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Serious situation? What is it? Is it interesting?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, there&#8217;s no way it is. I&#8217;m running the risk of dying over here&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh? That sounds interesting. Did you forget that I told you I&#8217;ve taken an interest in you, Oji-chan? Even though I&#8217;ve kept you alive since it seems you could entertain me, if you go enjoy things on your own, I might get angry.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>




<p>This. Crazy. WOMAAAAAAAN! Even though I already died multiple times here, what the hell about this is &#8216;interesting&#8217;!&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Can I hang up if you don&#8217;t need anything? What&#8217;s interesting is looking forward to what lies after I escape the crisis of death&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hang up? Don&#8217;t you mean sever the connection to your life?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, like I said&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uhehe. That sounds like a voice that&#8217;s about to disappear. Anyway, it&#8217;s interesting. All right, whatever. If it&#8217;s a death crisis, I&#8217;ll let it slide this time. Do your best not to die. I don&#8217;t want toys that entertain me to break already after all. Understood? Well then, bye-bye.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Then, I was one-sidedly hung up on. She&#8217;s a woman who plays with people&#8217;s lives every opportunity. On top of that, I was completely treated as a toy. Gritting my teeth, I felt the urge to throw my cell phone out into the vast expanse of the galaxy. But since I couldn&#8217;t do that, I wanted to at least hit the reject button on my own, but that was even more impossible. If I did, then it feels like she&#8217;d <em>really </em>jump at me for the kill.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During the call, Hikami-san arrived and talked to me as if she was waiting for me to hang up.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Who was it?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, let&#8217;s just say it was a weird person with some screws loose.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, is that so. By the way, the food stall seems to have disappeared.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, something is wrong. I get the feeling that she had accomplices with her, but&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As she agreed with my words, she indulged in something with a serious expression, but immediately started a clear analysis.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;By all means, the murder itself does not seem to be the purpose. In that case, it&#8217;s usually a single offender&#8230; &#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that so? Certainly, I&#8217;ve never seen a psychopathic murderer with an accomplice before. And it&#8217;s not just here. That house was also weird.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hikami-san, how did you find out about the house where that politician lives? It didn&#8217;t look like a house where he was living with his family after all.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t really know either. I saw him going into that house when I was tailing him last night, so I thought he must be living there.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so. Another strange thing is that&#8230; aren&#8217;t politicians usually guarded?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Yes, indeed they are. That&#8217;s why I tried to get rid of the guards first, but to my disappointment, he was alone.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Alone in a house with no family nor guards? That too one who isn&#8217;t even a regular person? Everything about this was strange. Anyway, nothing&#8217;s going to be solved if I just stand here.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go back to that house again. We may need to explore a little more detail. Did you check up to the second floor back then?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;No? I just went to the washroom for a while, but since I heard your voice saying you&#8217;d be going to the food cart, I followed you here.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The mission this time is peculiar. Most of the women whose capture information came out were enemies, but for the first time, I got one to be a friend. For some reason, that really made me excited. But for the time being, I came back to the politician&#8217;s house again, indulging myself in some idle chatting with her on the way. The inside of the house was still quiet. I checked all the first floor earlier, so it was the second floor&#8217;s turn this time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mm? Something&#8217;s wrong here.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As soon as we went upstairs and saw the corpse, Hikami-san tilted her head as if something was odd.&#8221; Of course, it didn&#8217;t look strange to my eyes. It&#8217;s just a corpse that had been decapitated clean.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is something wrong? Something strange, perhaps?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The lying posture is subtly different.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Subtly? It&#8217;s amazing she noticed that. Hikami-san completely sat down and began to examine every nook and cranny of the corpse&#8230; However, all she did was just stare at it, without trying to touch it. Seems like dirty things were of course dirty.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Seems like someone fished around his body.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Really?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was surprised to hear her say something unexpected so I asked again, but she seemed like she was already convinced of her own analysis with that firm expression on her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Kyaaaa&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mm?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Noooooo!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While thinking where she&#8217;d go while calmly analyzing, Hikami-san suddenly turned deep blue and hugged me. What happened to this woman all of a sudden?&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;What, is something wrong?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mo&#8230; A mouse!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>But when I looked in the direction she pointed towards, I couldn&#8217;t find anything like a mouse. If it did, it must have disappeared right then. But I didn&#8217;t dare say that the mouse was gone. That was because her perky breasts were gently pressing onto my chest.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Those breasts were so tender and elastic, like marshmallows, that they alone would be enough to bring one to ecstasy. How can they be so soft? But then, my neurons that were busy thinking about only these things were finally calmed down thanks to the reality of finding the corpse in front of me again. I regained my sanity and finally tried to separate her from myself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;The mouse ran away. Everything&#8217;s all right now.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-is that so?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>After raising her face a bit and surveying the surroundings, little by little, she separated away from me. And, perhaps due to embarrassment, she swiftly turned around and faced her back towards me. Is it even possible for someone to calmly kill someone yet be so afraid of mere mice? Even though she&#8217;s so strong, she&#8217;s unexpectedly shy. Well, that&#8217;s cute too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t particularly think that&#8217;s a problem, by the way.<br>Although we were veered off the main issue for a while because of the mouse, when we got a grip again, the fact that the corpse had traces of being moved was a conclusion both of us arrived at. Meaning someone had entered this house. Either when we went to the food cart a while back, or when we went there to sate ourselves after the politician was killed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If so, does this mean that the cart murderer and the corpse in this house have some kind of connection? Or did I jump too far into a conclusion?Amidst the ever-growing number of questions, I told her as she looked around wondering if the mouse was still there somewhere.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go down to the first floor for the time being.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps being afraid of encountering the mouse again, she took the lead down the stairs. I also followed down to the first floor. The first floor should have already been examined, but this time I started to turn the whole house over and explore it more carefully.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.7</strong></p>

<p>Then, I set foot in the largest room. A single bed and a cabinet. And also a dresser. At first glance, everything seemed to be provided, but this room also had no sense of being lived in. Aside from the properly laid out futon, all the cosmetics on the dresser were new. No trace of use.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It wasn&#8217;t like the people who lived here had left. Rather, it was like no one lived in this house from the very beginning. Only the furniture seemed perfectly decorated, meaning, it was all a camouflage.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If I think about it like that, it&#8217;s even more suspicious. Why camouflage? Because looking like a vacant house wasn&#8217;t acceptable? Not only was this suspicious, but there was a strong sense of discomfort emanating from the entire room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Bed, drawers, dresser. I looked closely at the furniture again. Wait a minute! A single bed?</p>



<p>Now that I mention it, the bed is too small for the size of this room. Dresser and drawers. And adding on size of the room, this is most definitely meant to be a couple&#8217;s bedroom. However, while decorating it like a such a room, the bed is for one person.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This was the true nature of the discomfort. The size of the bed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And thus when I got closer to investigate a little more, I discovered something very strange. The legs of the bed were wheeled. Like a chair with casters.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I tried forcing the bed sideways, my hand was able to push it away very easily. As if it was designed to move sideways. Is the reason why it is a bed for one person also considering the lightness in mind? Haha.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As the bed moved away, on the floor, a bunch of stairs came into view. Looks like the entrance to the basement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hikami-san!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Perhaps being nearby, she entered the room as soon as I called out. Looking at the passage I found, she began to carefully examine the bottom with her eyes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s quite suspicious that there&#8217;s a hidden basement here&#8230; Shall we take a look down there?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hikami-san took the sword out of her scabbard and carefully went downstairs, one step at a time. In that case, I also ought to equip myself.&nbsp;</p>



<p>« Would you like to use the Formless Sword? »&nbsp;</p>




<p>Once I clicked the screen, I felt the weight in my hand. This insubstantial sword is a very important item that protects my life.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As I descended down, a raw stench clung to my nostrils. More precisely, it was not like the stench of raw fish. But the reeking stench of blood.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The cement floor in the basement was littered with stains, just like I saw at a cart. What&#8217;s more, the stains before me were darker than what I saw back there.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This is definitely dark red. At the center of the floor, was an operating table. Surgical tools scattered around. I headed toward the corner, searching for some other possible clues. Over there, was a facility like a large public bath like you&#8217;d see in a bath-house. And undoubtedly, there were dark red stains scattered around here as well. A very chilling sight.&nbsp;</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>Hikami-san was looking around the opposite side of me, but she suddenly called out to me in a loud voice. Seems like she discovered something.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hasegawa-san. I think I&#8217;ve got it. It&#8217;s organ trafficking. Everything is for removing organs.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As soon as Hikami-san gave me a hand signal, she quickly climbed up to the stop of the stairs. Organ trafficking&#8230; She dashed up so urgently that I didn&#8217;t have time to process it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, we couldn&#8217;t go back to the first floor. Because the room where the passage was located had already been occupied by intense flames. And&#8230; the flames spread at high speeds following the liquid flowing down the stairs to the basement. Is that gasoline, perhaps? While protecting against it, I stepped back, but the harsh smoke gradually clouded my consciousness.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then&#8230; the fire spread rapidly to the basement. It was considerably hot. Am I gonna die like this? Is there no other way? I looked around, but there was no other exit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Just on the verge of being suffocated by the smoke, I hit &#8216;Load&#8217;. Just how many times has it been in this mission alone? Having no other choice, once again, I repeated every single step.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I kissed Hikami-san and ran to the food stall. I can&#8217;t avoid the kiss. This is a matter of our mutual feelings. After that, I hurried. Because before, the food stalls had already disappeared, but maybe if I hurry, I might be able to get some clues this time, was the thought.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, my hopes crumbled all at once. I sprinted, but there was still no food stall there anymore.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I violently breathed and leaned against the wall where the food stall once was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s try to sort out the situation for the time being.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hikami-san suddenly mentioned the words &#8216;organ trafficking&#8217;. I don&#8217;t know how she came to that conclusion just by looking at the operating room in the basement. Did she find a corpse with its organs pulled out? If so, I feel like some pieces of the puzzle are fitting together.&nbsp;</p>



<p>When I entered the stall alone, the ramen I ordered first probably contained a paralytic drug. Fortunately, I spilled it, so I didn&#8217;t end up getting drugged. I was also about to get my organs ripped out. I just happened to be lucky. The expression of the obsa-an that suddenly changed just by spilling ramen comes to mind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, if so, one question remains.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Why didn&#8217;t the ramen I ordered again contain the drug as well? There was no such thing in the yakitori that Hikami-san, who came in later, ordered either. Both of them came out safe. At that time, Hikami-san and I didn&#8217;t know each other. I already had my ramen ordered, and Hikami-san came in while she was putting the soup in the bowl.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Maybe, this is it?</p>



<p>If I had eaten first and gotten paralyzed, the person next to me may become suspicious. It is true that it is very unlikely that you&#8217;d end up eating food at the same time with someone when you don&#8217;t come in as companions. That&#8217;s why she didn&#8217;t put any medicine in the ramen that was ordered again. Of course, yakitori probably didn&#8217;t have any drug for the same reason as well. That&#8217;s why the expression of that aunt who missed her prey was so rotten.&nbsp;</p>




<p>After that, if they cut me down as revenge while I was wandering around in the alleyway, it would all make sense. Perhaps I&#8217;d have been torn apart and my organs removed. If, by chance, I hadn&#8217;t loaded back&#8230;&nbsp;</p>



<p>The thought gives me goosebumps.[1] It&#8217;s not just about being sliced to death, but also having my organs pulled out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I wonder what reason she had for not trying to abduct me as soon as I entered the stall?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Well, just seeing that paralytic drugs is being used shows how cautious the organization is. In the unlikely event that you try to use force to incapacitate and abduct someone, if you get caught by someone like Hikami-san, you might get killed.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the off chance that a mistake occurs and there&#8217;s a need to escape, it&#8217;s possible that your identity will soon be exposed, so that&#8217;s probably why they used a relatively safer approach like using the paralytic drug rather than a surprise attack.&nbsp;</p>




<p>And even though they had a numerical advantage, they didn&#8217;t suddenly attack us. Rather, you can see how well-prepared they are just by looking at how managed to reliably handle committing arson in the small gap they found while safely monitoring us. Burning everything is a great way to get rid of the evidence of the corpse on the second floor, the operating room in the basement, and even take care of us.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I was so amazed at the precision that I naturally ended up shaking my head at it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Unlike when I first went to the food stall independently, the second time was with Hikami-san. Naturally, we ordered the food at the same time.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s why we were given the paralytic drug that time. Of course, if you cook and bring in the food at the same time, the probability of the food being eaten at the same time would be very high. They discarded any method that could fail and chose the one that had the highest likelihood of succeeding, even by a small amount.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Given that the operating room was found in the house with the corpse, that politician is probably the mastermind.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In that case, this level of precision is understandable. It&#8217;s only natural that he was cautious considering his high social standing. Rather, the fact that the organization is moving even though the mastermind died means that there&#8217;s another mastermind behind this. Either that or it&#8217;s their death throes.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Of course, Hikami-san would have still killed the politician even without knowing that he was the mastermind behind such a smuggling organization. I&#8217;m sure even they felt that everything started to crumble.&nbsp;</p>



<p>That house must have been their operation center itself. An operation center near the food stall where the abductees can be immediately dismantled in a fresh state.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Nothing but the words &#8216;shitty bastard&#8217; came out of my mouth.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But thanks to that, I was able to assemble the puzzle. Since I know their method, countermeasures are possible.&nbsp;</p>




<p>So, how do I catch them? Having been stabbed, burnt, and killed multiple times in a row, exacting revenge on them is a given.&nbsp;</p>



<p>This time it was hardcore enough to go crazy.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Anyway, I have to fight back. Since I saw the future, I&#8217;ll take them by surprise. Accordingly, Hikami-san was also walking toward the food stall. Naturally, I felt the déjà vu. But I feel like I&#8217;m forgetting something. Right, the phone should probably ring around this time.&nbsp;</p>



<p><em>Tiririririri</em></p>



<p>As expected, the phone rang with a private number. I didn&#8217;t answer the phone, intending on later making the excuse that I was sleeping. Rather, I couldn&#8217;t afford answering it. I want to hurry back to the house and launch my counterattack.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hikami-san! I&#8217;m sorry, but let&#8217;s go back to that house again. Hurry!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eeh?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.7</strong></p>


<p>As I rushed back without any explanation, she became confused, but nevertheless started chasing after me for the time being. The phone seemed to be continuously ringing while I ran, but I couldn&#8217;t receive it. I didn&#8217;t have enough time to throw their expectations off. When I finally reached the house, the situation was the same as before. I arrived at the room without being unpunctual and waited for Hikami once I pushed the bed away, revealing the passage down to the basement. After a while, she appeared with a partially sweatbeat face.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you in such a hurry? Ah, this place is&#8230; &#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hikami-san looked at me and tried to say something, but when she found the stairs going down to the basement, she kept silent for a while and turned cautious. I shrugged a little and told her what the truth of the basement really was.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s an operating room. A bloody one…&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Operating room?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I started explaining as if I had already gone down to the basement.It&#8217;s all from the time before I hit &#8216;Load&#8217; so there&#8217;s no mistaking it. Then her expression suddenly darkened. I also felt her body shivering. But it does not seem to be one of fear. Must be other reasons.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Organ trafficking&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She seemed to be trying to keep a calm act, but her expression was not.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hikami-san?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>




<p>&#8220;It was because of this kind of organ trafficking organization that my actual younger brother got killed. Because they needed the eyes of a young child. These are the kinds of people I cannot forgive regardless of the commission.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>With her body shivering and hands trembling, she tightly gripped her sword. So that&#8217;s what was up. No way, so the trauma of her dead brother gave birth to the delusion of seeing any man younger than herself as her brother too? Was this woman trying to overlap me with her real younger brother now? Now that I mention it, I feel like she was saying something about her younger brother when I kissed her back then.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. I will protect Hasegawa-san no matter what.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>As she said that, she suddenly hugged me. It feels like her dead brother and I really are being overlapped. Of all things, why did it have to be her younger brother? Moreover, she also suddenly started to talk as if she was actually dealing with her real younger brother. I pushed her aside for the time being. And change the topic. No, it was also something that I was really worried about.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;So did you take revenge on them?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>




<p>&#8220;No. Because they disappeared just like that. Besides, I was inexperienced at the time. It&#8217;s a period where I was a solver in name only, and wasn&#8217;t a fully ready&#8230; &#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, it&#8217;s possible they&#8217;re part of the same group as well, right?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;ve been pursuing them for a long time as I received other commissions, but to think I&#8217;d find a clue to the incident in a place like this&#8230; &#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>&#8220;But&#8230; no matter how I think about it, I get the feeling that the mastermind would be someone like the politician you killed earlier, so by that logic, haven&#8217;t you already succeeded in exacting revenge?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;I wonder if that&#8217;s what came to. I did think he was trash, but to think he was also so rotten underneath. But the organization that&#8217;s still carrying out the practice still exists, right? It&#8217;s too early to say that revenge was successful.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is that so? Is the mission this time about uncovering the identity of the organ trafficking organization and make Hikami&#8217;s revenge successful? I started to feel confident about the clearing conditions of the capture mission. Considering the circumstances, everything is hitting the mark. If so, I must be even more proactive in helping her take revenge.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Rather, let us pretend to go down into the basement for a moment. Somehow, I feel like they are hiding and observing us.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>While saying that, I pulled her hand and went down to the basement. However, we did not enter completely and stopped in the middle of the stairs. The strategy was to only give them the idea that we&#8217;ve gone down into the basement, where in fact, we&#8217;ll be going back up immediately to surprise them.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Why did we stop here?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;If they got the idea that we went underground, they would make a move. Let&#8217;s surprise them at that time.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so? Meaning they&#8217;ve been monitoring us the whole time?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;When I went back to the food stall, the oba-san, who should have been lying fainted there, and the food stall itself had disappeared. If you look at it like that, it would be correct to think that they&#8217;ve caught on to our existence.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s how it is, huh. That&#8217;s why my brother&#8211;no&#8230; Hasegawa-san is smart.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Brother? Yeesh. Looks like the fact that both the organ trafficking organization situation and her dead brother being of similar age to me is making her see things even more strongly. I felt like I suddenly got to see her dark side. And in addition, she started stroking my head as if she was my real sister. I didn&#8217;t feel bad, but this is not how it&#8217;s supposed to be. Perhaps she felt it too, since she suddenly brought her hand back to her mouth. Looks like she herself was surprised.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah! I&#8217;m sorry. I involuntarily&#8230; ended up acting intimate. That&#8217;s&#8230; my brother is&#8230;So&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>She, who looked confused and lost. For once, I shook my head.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay to talk freely, but I&#8217;d like it if you don&#8217;t overlap me with you brother.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;O-of course! You are a different person after all. By the way…Could&#8230; Hasegawa-san please be at ease with me as well?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>I tried to tell her that that&#8217;s exactly the kind of treatment a younger brother would give, but I stopped. I hate being seen like her brother, but it&#8217;s better than being ignored. If her trauma is like that, it might not be a bad idea to approach it like this. It&#8217;s not bad having a good relationship with such a beautiful woman. Because she is a woman I have good affection points with. Should be fine as long as she can be brought out of her brother&#8217;s illusion little by little. By the time this mission is over, it&#8217;s not like our relationship will be at the point where we won&#8217;t meet each other again. So, just a little further should do. Haha.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Previously, the game TIP also mentioned that women with high affection points would ascend to reality. But of course, in reality, she&#8217;s a woman who&#8217;s originally out of my league. That&#8217;s why I want to continue deepening this connection steadily. But even so, I have to say what I want to say.&nbsp;</p>




<p>&#8220;That would be fine. Fumu, I am one named Hasegawa Ryou, not Hikami-san&#8217;s younger brother. I want you to be clear with that!&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I&#8217;m sorry&#8230;&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Her gaze kept following me while saying so. As I tried to escape from her line of sight, thinking that some time had passed, once I signalled Hikami-san, we ran up to the top of the stairs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>And then barged into the living room.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, the inside of the house was deathly quiet. In order to burn the flame like before, they&#8217;d have to complete their preparations and sprinkle gasoline around way earlier. However, I couldn&#8217;t find a single soul around, let alone gasoline.&nbsp;</p>




<p>&#8220;Why?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Something&#8217;s not right. I hurried up to the second floor again. Because I was holding her wrist, Hikami-san was naturally pulled along as well. She kept blankly staring at me.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is there anything different about this corpse?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Before the &#8216;Load&#8217;, she was suspicious of it being handled as soon as she saw the corpse. And how someone obviously fished around the corpse, traces of which were caught. However, this time there was no change in her expression as she stared at the corpse.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;No? There seems to be no change. Still the same as when I cut off his head.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Strange.I lot of things seems to have changed since loaded back. This is the first time. But how?&nbsp;</p>



<p>Where did it go out of order? I obviously acted the same as before the &#8216;Load&#8217;. I ran to a food stall and then came back to the house and found the basement. The only thing I did differently was the order in which I went upstairs. Before loading, I found a strange spot on the corpse on the second floor, then returned to the first floor and found the basement.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Is it just that? No, that&#8217;s not it. That alone does not explain why those who were supposed to light the fire wouldn&#8217;t come, nor those who were supposed to fish around the corpse would suddenly take a different course of action. Then what? How did I behave differently? Cold sweat is constantly poured out.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Looking back at my actions one by one, I ran to the food stall, saw that the food stall disappeared, and got a phone call. Then I answered the phone. Wait a minute, is it the phone call?&nbsp;</p>




<p>I freaked out and took out my cell phone. 3 notifications of unavailability. Aside from that time I hadn&#8217;t received her call when I was in front of the stall, my phone had continued ringing as I was on the run. Kusora had astonishingly rung me three times already.&nbsp;</p>



<p>If there&#8217;s any kind of change, it&#8217;d be this. In this world, I didn&#8217;t answer Kusora Yurea&#8217;s call.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Feeling a bad premonition, I ran out of the house.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oji-san.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>Kusora stood in front of the gate. Her face, full of anger.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The &#8216;Oji-chan&#8217; way of addressing with familiarity had changed to the simple &#8216;Oji-san&#8217;. In addition, her tone was extremely calm.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;If you had been sleeping soundly, at the very least, I might have been willing to forgive you. But you didn&#8217;t answer the phone while playing around in such a place? I hate people who don&#8217;t know their place.&#8221;&nbsp;</p>



<p>No, that&#8217;s not it.I thought I&#8217;d try using the &#8216;Formless Sword&#8217;, but if I managed to anger this ridiculous woman to this degree, then I couldn&#8217;t see any solution to this game at all. This was already a dead end. There were many guards behind her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>I let out a heavy sigh and immediately hit &#8216;Load&#8217;.&nbsp;</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.8</strong></p>

<p>Why wasn&#39;t answering her phone just distorting reality? Is it a rainy day butterfly effect?</p>   <p>Kuzora is not angry when she answers her phone. Everything is peaceful. He doesn&#39;t appear angry to find me and kill him.</p>   <p>But do you have to answer the phone? She gets angry. So, he comes with his guard and attacks.</p>   <p>What if some of your surroundings look stronger than you? Only careful organ trafficking will naturally retreat for the time being. So no matter how long you waited, he did not appear to arson.</p>   <p>Her family is at the center of the immense power of this country. Naturally, the clan&#39;s guards are by far the most powerful than organ traffickers.</p>   <p>&quot;Hahahaha.&quot;</p>   <p>Just not answering the phone would change reality so much. A really scary woman.</p>   <p>After [loading] I headed to the stall again. And wait for the phone. After a while, the phone rang. Why are you nervous because of this? I picked up the phone and talked to Kuzora as before. The conversation ended peacefully. This will not show up anymore.</p>   <p>I returned to the politician&#39;s house and went straight to the second floor with Mr. Hikami. Soon she said someone seemed to have caught a corpse. Everything was the same until the rat came out. That&#39;s how I get the results I want. With all the dejavu feeling, he proceeded with the same flow as when he was set on fire.</p>
<p>He takes Mr. Hikami to the room and discovers the basement under the bed. She pulled her hand and entered the basement. And have the same conversation on the stairs.</p><p>`` Let&#39;s go back! &#39;&#39;</p>
<p>I hid in the basement and seemed to have passed some time, so I ran up to the living room. Finally, they caught their tail. Three men were holding the tanks and preparing to light them. When we suddenly appeared, they turned their knives, but Mr. Hikami was much quicker. She cuts off the man&#39;s arm as if to dance seriously. Then the hand holding the sashimi knife was cut along with the wrist. The man whose hand was cut off fell screaming. There was no mercy.</p>   <p>Mr. Hikami has torn the back of a man who has fallen unprotected and defenseless. The other one approached her with a loud voice, but the man&#39;s possession of knives had been reduced to two. The same serious, but the ability is too different. And immediately fell. The other one began to backtrack, looking at it and feeling danger.</p>   <p>&quot;Keep it alive! You have to find their hometown!&quot;</p>   <p>Her sword was approaching to cut the man&#39;s heart, but stopped quickly. Luckily, I heard my words, and she kicked her instead of turning her knife. The man blew straight into the living room with a powerful kick. After all it was strong. No matter how serious you are, you can put away three men in such an instant.</p>   <p>Mr. Hikami walked up and approached, glaring at the man&#39;s chest, as if killing him.</p>   <p>&quot;Where are the other guys?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;....&quot;</p>   <p>But the man was silent, just staring back at Mr. Hikami. It&#39;s a useless sting.</p>   <p>-Bass!</p>   <p>Hikami&#39;s sword then cut his man&#39;s arm. The face of a man whose forearm had been cut without any notice was distorted by pain.</p>   <p>Human trafficking. They sell the worst organs. No matter how much I scream, I don&#39;t feel sorry. Mr. Hikami crushed his cut with his feet as if putting out a cigarette. Lifting the body of the fainted man, she gave her final notice.</p>   <p>&quot;Listen again, next is my neck.&quot;</p>   <p>There is no hesitation in the intimidating eyes on the ice. If he keeps silence, his neck will soon be separated from his body. I had no doubt about that fact. And he said he knew the fact like me, and lifted the other arm up.</p>   <p>`` Oo ...</p>   <p>When Hikami hears this, she releases her hand from her chest and swings her sword. The man&#39;s neck was cut off, and blood jumped from his neck and the man died. Her expression was so terrifying that she couldn&#39;t approach her easily.</p>   <p>&quot;that…?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Yup…?&quot;</p>   <p>Fortunately, when I called, she responded refreshingly, brightening her angry face. Others have a grim reaper face and a gentle and warm expression to me. No wonder the gap.</p><p></p>   <p>[Mission &quot;Unveil the identity of the stall&quot; Clear difficulty C] [Congratulations. Bonus 50 million yen has been deposited. ]</p>   <p>As usual, when I checked the [Status Window], a window to inform me of the clearing appeared. Seeing that it had been cleared even though its homeland had not yet been destroyed, the mission was not to pursue organ trafficking but to reveal the stalls and the secrets surrounding this house.</p>   <p>Then my mission is complete. However, she tried to destroy the remnants. Should I help? It seems a bit different to get out of here. It&#39;s OK because there is [intangible sword]. Of course, it&#39;s useless because it&#39;s not for offense.</p>   <p>&quot;I feel we have left so many traces in this house. Would you like to burn more? Even the evidence of the organ traffickers is gone, but the purpose is to arrest them. Will you kill everyone instead? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>She nodded that Mr. Hikami killed too many corpses and made suggestions to destroy the evidence.</p>   <p>&quot;They may or may not be related to his brother&#39;s death, but we cannot forgive him.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Yes, let&#39;s burn here.&quot;</p>   <p>Already they had a gas tank ready to burn the house, so there was no problem up to the point where the fire started. I&#39;m still under the asylum of the game, but it&#39;s the right answer to burn here, because Mr. Hikami couldn&#39;t help getting a clue and being chased by the police. Well, if her ability is as good as her, my worries may be even more troublesome.</p>   <p>It doesn&#39;t burn down. I threw a lighter at the gasoline where it was scattered and ran out of the house with Mr. Hikami. The home of organ trafficking, which has killed many people, has begun to burn off. I felt bitter and refreshing, and when I looked up at the flames, I suddenly heard a shimmering voice from behind.</p>   <p>I was surprised at the familiar voice and looked back and my body was solidified.</p>   <p>&quot;Uncle! Yaho!&quot;</p>     </p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.9</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Oh! Yah!&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;..........&quot;</p>   <p>Why did she go here again? What did I make wrong? I should have answered the call and kept her in good mood. And I guess the mission clear window had already come out. But why is she suddenly standing like a symbol of dead ending laughing in front of her? Someone please, please explain.</p>   <p>Huh? Laughing? Certainly, in the future, I saw an angry face that didn&#39;t seem to laugh. It was like an ambassador who came to convict. But now it is different. Smiling brightly. While having a refreshing atmosphere.</p>   <p>&quot;You .... why are you here?&quot;</p>   <p>`` When I came to such a place, do you ask such a boring question? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>Her expression that looks like moonlight is distorted. I was in a hurry and changed the story.</p>   <p>`` Since I told you on the phone that I was in danger of death, did you appear to try to watch that moment live? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>`` Roughly correct! &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>&quot;Yes, that&#39;s fortunate if it didn&#39;t come directly to killing.&quot;</p><p>&quot;So where is the danger of death? If it&#39;s a lie, can I make that crisis?&quot;</p>   <p>I was angry at not answering the phone before [Road] and really made a crisis of death.</p>   <p>Speaking of which, when she appeared now, there was a time difference from before [loading]. Because they were angry in the previous world, or because they appeared earlier than they were now, the organization members couldn&#39;t light them and rolled their tails.</p>   <p>But now he appears after grabbing and mopping behind organ traffickers, tortured, and lit his house. The mission was not affected.</p>   <p>Did she say that she was so boring that she came to see me in a crisis of death? Hahahaha. Damn.</p>   <p>As his head hurts and is shivering his temples, Mr. Hikami, who was staring at the sky next to him, suddenly lowered his head and greeted himself, as if he suddenly remembered something. Was. I opened my eyes wide, surprised at the fact that they were acquaintances.</p>   <p>&quot;Young lady! What is it for here?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Hmm? Oh, you&#39;re the solver? What are you doing here ...?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;A little!&quot;</p>   <p>I was amazed and got into the conversation between the two. Then two women look at me at the same time. Kusora blocked my words, right? With that expression, Mr. Hikami&#39;s expression did not change. However, I dared to ask Kusaku&#39;s expression without hesitation.</p>   <p>`` Solutionist? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>&quot;Uncle, maybe you didn&#39;t want to live anymore? I mentioned earlier, I hate those who don&#39;t know the status ...&quot;</p>   <p>`` No, why, why? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>&quot;You&#39;re the solver because you&#39;re a solver? Uncle really died ...&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Why am I an uncle? Not Hasegawa-san, why? I&#39;m younger than her!&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;What&#39;s that?&quot;</p>   <p>She glanced at her eyebrows that she was interrupted three times and looked up at me. It may not be an optical illusion that the guards&#39; hands, standing behind her with a shy sign, moved slightly.</p>   <p>`` Well, why is it that my life was interrupted and my story just for that reason? Puhahahaha is interesting! &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>She continued to laugh with herself while saying so. What is so interesting. I asked a serious question.</p><p>&quot;Oh, I laugh too much and I have a stomach ache. It&#39;s been a long time.</p>   <p>&quot;I want you to do it.&quot;</p>   <p>I said dignifiedly in a face that I was not convinced. Then Kuzora lightly frowns.</p>   <p>&quot;I&#39;m an uncle, so I&#39;m an uncle. I don&#39;t need any other words. If I say so, I&#39;m so.&quot;</p>   <p>It&#39;s a definite word. I can&#39;t understand at all, but I can&#39;t do anything. Because Kuzora insists. I decided to shut my mouth around here, because I shouldn&#39;t be offended. Then Hikami asks Kusora.</p>   <p>`` Lady, do you know my brother? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>Mr. Hikami, who had heard that he could not understand the conversation at the moment, asked and asked, Kuzora nodded.</p>   <p>&quot;Hey? Little brother? Solver, since when did you have such a little brother?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Ah! Did you know Ryo, not your brother?&quot;</p>   <p>`` Ryo-kun? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>She shook her hand from side to side in the air, surprised by her saying. And somehow correct the words.</p>   <p>`` No, so ... do you know Mr. Hasegawa? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>Mr. Hikami was a series of chaos alone. The name was not stable and was panicked. Moreover, I was surprised when the name below was called by you. Indeed, the effect of his dead brother is enormous. Up to how important my brother was ...</p>   <p>However, I got goose bumps because the expression of Kusuku was a little strange at this moment. To be precise, when Mr. Hikami called my name. He bit his lips casually, frowning. And the eyebrows are about to rise.</p>   <p>I don&#39;t know what I don&#39;t like, but it&#39;s ridiculous to offend her. So I started talking about changing the topic.</p>   <p>&quot;By the way, what is the relationship between the two?&quot;</p>   <p>Then, Kuzora said, pointing to the wand on which her sword was sleeping.</p>   <p>&quot;Occasionally I&#39;ll do it because I have the ability. Well, most of it is from Grandpa. I don&#39;t want to go for such a boring thing, but I can&#39;t help but not work.&quot;</p>   <p>What&#39;s your request? And what is your job? There&#39;s a lot to ask, but I pushed my words back into my throat again. It sounds like there is nothing good to ask. Furthermore, when I saw the word boring, I was about to fly if I asked for something weird. I have to keep my words. Life is connected, you are old.</p>   <p>&quot;Oh, well, that&#39;s good. By the way, what should I do? The crisis of life has already been resolved.&quot;</p>   <p>Then, Kuzuka glanced at Hikami&#39;s sideways glance and walked straight to me with a doshidoshi. And grabbed my chest.</p>   <p>&quot;It doesn&#39;t matter. Actually, there is another purpose.&quot;</p>   <p>When Kuzora signaled by hand, a luxury sedan slipped in front of the burning house. She looked around and the guards standing behind opened the car door, grabbed me firmly and pushed me into the car.</p>   <p>&quot;Cho, a little! What are you doing ...&quot;</p>   <p>And Kushiro himself gets into the car. I moved away from her in fear of fear to the other door. I tried to open the door, but it was locked.</p>   <p>&quot;My uncle has a place to go with me, so say goodbye to the solutionman here.&quot;</p>   <p>She told me to ignore him and drop the window.</p>   <p>&quot;What the hell. I still have something to do with Mr. Hikami.&quot;</p><p>While saying so, Kusora pushed my head to jump into the window with my hand.</p>   <p>`` I don&#39;t know what the job is, but is that enough? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>&quot;Yes, that&#39;s right, but why is he ...&quot;</p>   <p>As expected, Hikami. To ask this woman. That too for me. I&#39;m impressed and tears are coming out.</p>   <p>`` How much do you get angry even if you try to ask such a question every time? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>&quot;I&#39;m sorry!&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Do not look so regrettable. Fufu. Goodbye.&quot;</p>     </p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.10</strong></p>

<p>However, Mr. Hikami surrendered by raising the white flag on the words of the following Kuzora. damn it. Abduction in the midday of noon. It&#39;s not the daytime, dawn. Suddenly, the fact that he did not even know Mr. Hikami&#39;s contact information emerged. I was impatient.</p>   <p>&quot;Cho, just a phone number, not even a number ...&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Leave&quot;</p>   <p>I screamed out of the door, but Kuzora calmly closed the window. Of course, my words did not reach Mr. Hikami, and the car left as ordered by her.</p>   <p>&quot;Isn&#39;t it terrible? At least let me exchange just the number.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;It&#39;s ridiculous that your uncle&#39;s habitat is the number of the solver.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;What did you say?&quot;</p>   <p>Of course, the last line was an imagination. The voice of my heart. In reality, I silently gave myself to my car, as if by a chuck in my mouth. Well, knowing the address anyway, it&#39;s easy to find. With that in mind, I began to worry about her purpose.</p>   <p>&quot;So where is it?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;What? I&#39;m still standing still and it&#39;s troublesome to explain each time.&quot;</p><p>&quot;No, but I abducted it suddenly, at least as much as the explanation ...&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Fufufu&quot;</p>   <p>I suddenly lowered my face, so I wondered if I had upset my nerves again, but rather began to laugh with a terrible mood. Speaking of which, I seemed in a good mood from the moment I took him from Mr. Hikami and put it in a car. Unless you misunderstand.</p>   <p>&quot;Which mouth is said to be an abduction?&quot;</p>   <p>And I started pulling my lips. How do you react? I&#39;m really in trouble.</p>   <p>&quot;Mr. Hikami ... Wow ...&quot;</p>   <p>Then, Kuzora&#39;s eyebrows suddenly rise.</p>   <p>&quot;When did you become a good friend with that woman? Give up, it&#39;s not interesting.&quot;</p>   <p>I seemed to be in a good mood, but suddenly I was in a bad mood again. Damn, why she changed her mood often, was a woman who really hurt her head. Do you want to capture such a woman? Not now, but I was horrified by the great crisis that was coming. I became more sick, and I killed before killing and rampaging. If you can&#39;t avoid it, now you have to just obey, now.</p>   <p>&quot;By the way, what were you doing together?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;What? The case was under investigation.&quot;</p>   <p>It was actually a mission, but it&#39;s a similar story. So I responded accordingly.</p>   <p>&quot;Is that as interesting as before? An incident that upsets my expectations? Tell me.&quot;</p>   <p>Then, Kuzura shouted his eyes and urged him. But I am in trouble. How do you explain all that?</p>   <p>&quot;It&#39;s a long talk, and it might be boring to you ...&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Uncle. That&#39;s what I judge.&quot;</p>   <p>Kokuzora, whose eyes were shining, glanced at him for a moment while narrowing his eyes. Eventually, he began to explain what had happened at midnight, yielding to the threat. Of course, it was a little adaptation, and I started to investigate because the stall was suspicious from the beginning. When I tell the story of my hero, she sums it up in one word.</p>   <p>&quot;That&#39;s boring! Such an ordinary story. There&#39;s no way to overturn my expectations.&quot;</p>   <p>Kuzuka turned backwards with a frustrated expression. Would it be a little surprising to hear that reality had been switched by answering or not answering her call? I managed to endure such a desire. The content of the game cannot be dismissed.</p><p>She turned her back on me and her hair smelled faintly and her nose was troubled. The body reacts to her scent. I&#39;m foolish enough to inadvertently smell the scent, even though it&#39;s more dangerous than a rose with many spines.</p>   <p>What&#39;s more, today wasn&#39;t the usual hoodie. In other words, she was not filthy. The hair is dry and the face with light makeup accentuates the charm. White dress up to thigh length, gray jacket, and black stockings. As if going to a high seat in each ceremony. I gently swallowed my saliva.</p>   <p>To be honest, except for her family and personality, she looks like a painting. I feel like I&#39;m going to be sucked. I shook my head in my heart as the memory of the time when I was fond of the pretty Kushiro she played was revived.</p>   <p>&quot;Uncle?&quot;</p>   <p>Then the sky is coming closer.</p>   <p>&quot;I&#39;m a little bored right now. What can I do? Try something.&quot;</p>   <p>And he made a demonic smile and showed it. Then, you open your eyes open to see if you suddenly found something.</p>   <p>&quot;Uncle ... Pooh. What? Why are your pants inflated?&quot;</p>   <p>I was surprised and looked down. Stupid honest body. The fragrance is also fragrant, but the valley of the chest that looks every time it moves. Rather, my alter ego, which is more exciting than naked, is about to be seen, and my alter ego has begun to threaten the Lord&#39;s life.</p>   <p>However, the reaction of Kuzora seemed rather interesting. Suddenly straddle over me. I&#39;m riding on my thighs and staring at me.</p>   <p>Then again, the brain and lower body started playing separately.</p>   <p>`` Did you get excited at me? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>Kuzora began to stroke one-handed trousers. I have to excuse it. It is likely that she will die at her own pace. So I carefully removed Kusora&#39;s hand.</p>   <p>&quot;That&#39;s not it.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Uncle, what are you shy about, I want to see all my nakedness.</p>   <p>&quot;That&#39;s not true.&quot;</p>   <p>Of course. If you do, death should be waiting.</p>   <p>`` But why are you so excited here? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>Kuzuka looks up at me from the front. Deadly cuteness. However, the brain did reject this situation. I do not want die.</p>   <p>So I pushed her body sideways. Desperately desperate. And he started making excuses.</p>   <p>&quot;This is a physiological phenomenon, not because of the excitement. It&#39;s similar to the physiological phenomenon that happens to a man in the morning. It&#39;s a morning erection.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Ufufu. Morning erection? I don&#39;t know about that. Which one would you show?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Huh? Stop it! Hey!&quot;</p>   <p>Kuzora suddenly tried to remove my pants chuck. Why is this woman totally like this? What challenges and traps are going to give me. I held my hand over the pants chuck to defend.</p>   <p>&quot;I&#39;m honest, I didn&#39;t say anything because I didn&#39;t say anything, but I just put up with it a little bit. I didn&#39;t try me any more. Uncle.&quot;</p>   <p>She takes my hand while threatening. I grabbed her wrist again and told me.</p>   <p>&quot;I see, I see, I&#39;ll show you. If you want to see that much, I&#39;ll show you. Do it yourself, let your hands go.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Yes? Well then, early. Morning.</p><p>This woman had no shame from the beginning. In particular, you don&#39;t need to be shy because you don&#39;t care about the gaze of others.</p>   <p>When I dropped my pants and my pants, my bump was exposed in the car. Then, the expression was no longer reluctant to express his interest as if he suddenly lost interest.</p>   <p>&quot;Huh? Well, nothing has changed. Ordinary. There&#39;s something special about erection in the morning ... but isn&#39;t it smaller than I saw before?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Huh? I&#39;ll wear my pants anyway.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;wait!&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Why was it smaller than you saw when you helped your uncle at a social party before? It was when I was underneath. How funny was the expression that I endured in red at that time.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;It&#39;s ... it depends on the stimulus. It&#39;s just a morning physiology.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Does the size change so freely?&quot;</p>   <p>The demon suddenly seems to be curious again. I shook my head so hard that the consequences of that curiosity were so scary. But she had no mercy. She desperately dropped my hand trying to wear pants.</p>   <p>&quot;Uncle, if you put out that boring thing, I wonder if I was surprised to say that I&#39;d wear my pants again? Maybe I&#39;m a little interested, because I saw something that grew, but I never saw the process. &quot;</p>   <p>Then, watch your face close to my hump and watch carefully. She said so shortly before her sigh touched her and she felt a little sick. Looks really crazy. I felt like chanting sutras in my head.</p>   <p>However, my stupid mache hurts in response to the sigh. Huh, my son.</p>   <p>`` Why are you so excited? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>In addition, Kuzora immediately notices the reaction and asks a question. I can&#39;t answer.</p>   <p>Please manage this woman who uses my bump for quest. I screamed in my heart, but no one could help me.</p>   <p>`` I was so excited about your sigh, but what? &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>I&#39;m tired of being a toy anymore, so I answered honestly. Then, Kuzuka suddenly laughed.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.11</strong></p>

<p>&quot;Ufufu. Really? Uncle is honest. But honestly isn&#39;t always good. What do you do if you die by mistake?&quot;</p>   <p>Don&#39;t say that with a grumpy face. I can&#39;t read the real intention.</p>   <p>&quot;But it&#39;s not that big yet.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;No, what the hell is that quest? It&#39;s not that interesting.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;It&#39;s pretty cute to do things big and small, and at least it&#39;s not boring. And it&#39;s natural human curiosity to want to see something you haven&#39;t seen before. Only the uncle can survive me showing this dirty one-on-one like this, so I have no choice but to ask my uncle.</p>   <p>&quot;No, please be patient.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Then, let me get up right in front of me and I&#39;ll keep it alive.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;No, that&#39;s why. Honestly, it&#39;s difficult for a man to become completely stiff without stimulation.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;You should be stimulating yourself, let&#39;s release our hands, do it.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;That&#39;s hard work alone. I hope you&#39;ll stimulate it.&quot;</p><p><script src=/d/js/ad/ad01.js></script></p>   <p>When she was acting as before, she thought that Kuzora wouldn&#39;t be able to touch the man&#39;s bumps, so she spit out, and she narrowed her eyes and affirmed.</p>   <p>&quot;I just lie.&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Is it true?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;Let&#39;s touch it yourself. I hate lies most in the world. Can you take the weight of the words your uncle says?</p>   <p>There are quite a few things I hate. A lie calls a lie, but he has fallen into a trap. I closed my eyes while chanting sutras. If her attractive appearance gets into her eyes, she might be ruined. And he took his hand reluctantly.</p>   <p>Fortunately, there was no change. It&#39;s a swelling state. Without stiffening. Then a while passed. With no change, Kuzora frowned.</p>   <p>&quot;Hmm, it&#39;s alright. What&#39;s more, it&#39;s dirty.&quot;</p>   <p>So I was glad to finally get my pants up. However, Kuzoku immediately stopped my action.</p>   <p>&quot;Uncle? Who said you can lift it? You couldn&#39;t see what I wanted to see, but give up?&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;But it&#39;s alright?&quot;</p>   <p>I couldn&#39;t finish the words until the end. . She suddenly stripped off her shoes and began rubbing my bumps with her black stockings.</p>   <p>&quot;I&#39;ll help if it&#39;s hard alone, but I don&#39;t like touching it with my hand. So I&#39;ll give you stimulation with my feet and try to get up fast. I can&#39;t help but worry about the process. &#39;&#39;</p>   <p>While saying so, Kuzuka approached her soles without any hesitation. A black stocking touches my bump. Needless to say the result.</p>   <p>Kuzora began to laugh.</p>   <p>&quot;Puhah. Wonderful. It&#39;s a stupid desire. It&#39;s okay. You can wear it.&quot;</p>   <p>Kushiro was satisfied or separated from his feet and tried to put on his shoes. However, the movement stops.</p>   <p>&quot;Uncle. I&#39;m wet on my toes. No way ...&quot;</p>   <p>&quot;That&#39;s not it. Just touching it wouldn&#39;t be. It&#39;s like water coming out of a physiological phenomenon, water.&quot;</p>   <p>I excused, shaking my hand. It is also a fact. The name is also famous patience juice.</p><p>Then Kuzora narrowed her eyebrows and began taking off her stockings. He looked awkward, so he was nervous a hundred times. Just like your hand is on the road. She didn&#39;t know my distress, she threw her stockings off at me, still calm.</p>   <p>&quot;I&#39;ll give it. I&#39;ll get angry if I throw it away.&quot;</p>   <p>What? No problem ... Such a wonderful present. When I picked up my stockings, her body temperature remained and it was still warm. No, I&#39;m in trouble. Such an impossible gift. For an instant, I thought I couldn&#39;t laugh.</p>   <p>&quot;I&#39;m back today. I&#39;m a bit busy today, so don&#39;t contact me.&quot;</p>   <p>The guards dragged me out of her car where they came from. I was taken away and stared at her, but she casually winked and closed the car door.</p>   <p>I was angry with her stockings. When I finally returned to my sanity, I realized that it was in front of a stop where we often met.</p>   <p>By the way, how did she appear before that house? Even though he said he was busy. I had no idea what I wanted. You&#39;re busy and want to contact me? Not a joke. Whether you&#39;re busy or not, you won&#39;t be contacted.</p>   <p>So I shook my head. It would be impossible for a mediocre person like me to get to know her spiritual world. I&#39;ll leave it. He stopped thinking about her and headed home with his stockings. If you tell me to kill if you throw it away, you can&#39;t throw it away. Already in the morning, the city started to get busy and came home with the women who completely treated me in stockings as a pervert. It was a tough night. It was a long, labyrinthine night for me because of the continual loading. I laid her stocking on the desk and lay down on the bed.</p>   <p>He tried to sleep, but got up. Somehow, it seemed better to sleep after organizing the items.</p>   <p>So I loaded [Status Window].</p>   <p>Ryo Hasegawa Age: 25 Occupation: Neat Level: 4 Physical Strength: 65 Charm: 62 Money: 64,779,030 yen Experience: 503/801</p>   <p>The money, which was less than 20 million yen, increased by 50 million yen by solving this mission. The money spent on [domestic cars] has earned a generous amount of profit.</p>   <p>[Level up! You can improve your ability. (0/200)]</p>   <p>Health: 65/999 + -Charm: 62/999 +-</p>   <p>And distribute the appeared ability value. I started increasing my stats equally.</p>   <p>[Level up! You can improve your ability. (200/200)]</p>   <p>Health: 155/999 + -Charm: 172/999 +-</p>   <p>The appeal and physical strength that had been raised were outstanding. To be honest, I was wondering if it was really meaningful. However, during this mission, I felt that I needed to increase [Physical Strength] when using [Items] like [Intangible Sword], so I couldn&#39;t ignore it.</p>   <p>After allocating the abilities, check [Remaining time] and enter.</p>   <p>[Remaining time: 8645 hours] [Elapsed time: 138 hours] [If you cannot complete completely within the remaining time, your body will die. ]</p>   <p>A lot of time still remains. Of course, it&#39;s too dangerous to guess whether this is long or short.</p>   <p>Enter [Item].</p>   <p>[Lv.4 Scouter 500,000 yen] [Sleep spray 250,000 yen] [Universal key 600,000 yen] [Camera 100,000 yen] [Transformation medicine 1 million yen] [Telescope 700,000 yen] [Stopwatch 30 million yen] [500,000 yen for glasses] [800,000 yen for earphones] [400,000 yen for pencil] [100,000 yen for sunglasses] [50 million yen for foreign cars] [8 million yen for domestic cars]</p>   <p>New items added were sunglasses, earphones and pencils. Still, there was no point in using the name alone. And after finishing the previous mission, I felt like I could buy items each time as needed for the capture situation. To be honest, at the time, I don&#39;t think that [glasses] were necessary.</p>   <p>So I purchased only the essential item Lv.4 Scouter.</p>   <p>However, strengthening items is essential.</p>   <p>[Items] [Lv.4 Scouter] [Universal key] [Sleep spray] [Camera] [Telescope] [Glasses] [Intangible sword]</p>   <p>Immediately touched the universal key. The all-purpose key is a really useful item, so it&#39;s an absolute boost.</p><p>[Universal key] [Enhance 2] [You can open any door. ] [Used by standing in front of the desired door and touching the window] [Remaining use count 10 times] [Items can be strengthened by level up. ]</p>   <p>Touched item enhancement.</p>   <p>[Enhance item? [Enhancement cost for Enhancement 2–Enhancement 3: ¥ 300,000]</p>   <p>When you touch the window again, the usual message appears.</p>   <p>[Enhancement completed]</p>   <p>Enhancement is complete, this time touch the item description.</p>   <p>[Universal key] [Enhance 3] [You can open any door. ] [Used by standing in front of the desired door and touching the window] [Remaining 30 uses]</p>   <p>30 times. At this level, you don&#39;t have to worry about getting zero. Next is sleep spray. This is also the only attack weapon. Strengthening is mandatory.</p>   <p>[Sleep spray] [Enhancement 2] [Sleep spray as the name suggests. Boasts powerful performance. ] [Once you touch the item window, just stare at the target. ] [Usable distance: 3M] [Duration: 3 hours] [Items can be strengthened by level up. ]</p>   <p>Touched item enhancement as well.</p>   <p>[Enhance item? [Enhancement cost for Enhancement 2–Enhancement 3: ¥ 300,000]</p>   <p>Same as before. This also took 300,000 yen to complete the reinforcement.</p>   <p>[Sleep spray] [Enhance 3] [Sleep spray as the name suggests. Boasts powerful performance. ] [Once you touch the item window, just stare at the target. ] [Usable distance: 4M] [Duration: 4 hours]</p>   <p>And next is the intangible sword.</p>   <p>[Intangible sword] [Intangible sword returns all visible attacks. ] [But only a visible attack is possible, and it is useless for surprising surprises. ] [Items can be strengthened by level up. ]</p>   <p>Surprisingly, intangible swords could also be strengthened. To be honest, I just pushed it, but my heart suddenly throbbed. How strong will this powerful item be if it is strengthened? Is it possible to attack? It is an item that I love so much.</p>   <p>[Enhance item? Enhancement cost: 50 million yen]</p>   <p>But soon lost his words. It costs 50 million yen for one step of enhancement. Why is it? Enhancement 1 costs 50 million yen. Is it an unusual item that receives such special treatment?</p>   <p>If so, immediate reinforcement is impossible. If you spend 50 million yen, only 10 million yen remains. If the surplus fund is 10 million yen, it is impossible to respond to an unexpected situation. I decided to give up my [intangible sword] until I could collect more money.</p>
