<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; Truth and Lies</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.1</strong></p>


<p>Once again, a different message appeared.</p>



<p>«You have leveled up. You can improve your ability points. (10/10)»</p>



<p>Constitution: 55/999 +-<br />Charm: 12/999 +-</p>



<p>I was right on the mark!</p>



<p>The capture condition was neither to do it nor to go out with them. It was to disclose hidden mysteries. Whether that was about a murder or any kind of hidden corruption. If so, does this mean that capture information will only appear for women with mysteries? Of course, that&#8217;s nothing more than a hunch of mine. There can be a variety of capture conditions for different women. I&#8217;ll be able to find out once I try capturing others.</p>



<p>Either way, I can increase my ability points now. Honestly, I didn&#8217;t even need to ponder about it. Having a Charm of only 12, even approaching a woman is hard work.</p>



<p>This seems important, as long as the capture target is a woman.</p>



<p>«You have leveled up. You can improve your ability points. (0/10)»</p>



<p>Constitution: 55/999 +-<br />Charm: 22/999 +-</p>



<p>I spent all my points on Charm and exited &#8216;Status&#8217;.</p>



<p>Anyway, I obtained 5,000,000 ¥. However, the items cost so much that even 5,000,000 doesn&#8217;t feel like much. Even so, it&#8217;s true that I&#8217;m happy. In any case, it&#8217;s great to know that I&#8217;ll receive money after a capture.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s check out how much time is remaining.</p>



<p>«Remaining Time: 8731 hours»<br />«Elapsed Time: 29 hours»<br />«Once the time remaining ends and capture isn’t completely cleared, your real body shall pass on.»</p>



<p>I still have time to spare. The capture was achieved, but I still don&#8217;t know what it means by complete clearance. I&#8217;ve thought about this a little before, but it seems like I need to satisfy a set number of captures, huh.</p>


<p>Not wanting to look at it anymore, I got out of the &#8216;Remaining Time&#8217;, followed by two messages appearing before me.</p>



<p>«TIP: After complete clearance, you may carry over your savings even after you return to reality.»</p>



<p>«Once you have decided on a target, it is impossible to abandon it midway.»</p>



<p>Looks like not just my life but my money is also at the mercy of this game. However, I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d take the bait and start lusting over earning money here. My life&#8217;s more important than money. I have no need to stay fixated on cash. That&#8217;s why the second TIP appealed more to me than the money one. It meant I wouldn&#8217;t be able to turn back once I&#8217;ve embarked on a mission.</p>



<p>When I touched it, the message just disappeared. And out came the opening screen. Just like that, I clicked on &#8216;Status&#8217;.</p>



<p>Hasegawa Ryou<br />Age: 25 years<br />Occupation: NEET<br />Level: 2<br />Constitution: 55<br />Charm: 22<br />Savings: 7,258,930 ¥<br />EXP: 35/204</p>



<p>My eyes stopped at my savings of 7,258,930 ¥. Compared to the initial amount, it had increased quite a bit.</p>



<p>Since I had leveled up, I brought my finger towards &#8216;Item Shop&#8217; with expectations of new items.</p>



<p>«LV 2 Scouter: 150,000 ¥»<br />«Sleep Spray: 250,000 ¥»<br />«Master Key: 600,000 ¥»<br />«Camera: 100,000 ¥»<br />«Morph Potion: 1,000,000 ¥»<br />«Telescope: 700,000 ¥»<br />«Stopwatch: 30,000,000 ¥»<br />«Imported Car: 50,000,000 ¥»<br />«Domestic Car: 8,000,000 ¥»</p>



<p>The newly added items were &#8216;Morph Potion&#8217;, &#8216;Telescope&#8217; and &#8216;Stopwatch&#8217;. Plus the Scouter became level LV 2, increasing its price by 50,000 ¥.</p>


<p>Besides the indispensable Scouter, I could only sigh at the amount the rest of them cost. I&#8217;d really like to see what use the &#8216;Domestic Car&#8217; and &#8216;Imported Car&#8217; have but right now, it&#8217;s impossible. &#8216;Domestic Car&#8217; alone costs 8,000,000 ¥. I can&#8217;t buy it.</p>



<p>Furthermore, &#8216;Stopwatch&#8217; costs 30,000,000 ¥… There should be a limit to how high one can go! Casting aside my untainted curiosity, I concentrated on the &#8216;Morph Potion&#8217; and &#8216;Telescope&#8217; which I could afford.</p>



<p>Both of them totalled to 1,700,000 ¥. Gotta buy them. You gotta buy what you gotta buy. Wouldn&#8217;t it be pointless if I end up dying because I was stingy with money?</p>



<p>Thus, my final shopping list was three items: &#8216;LV 2 Scouter&#8217;, &#8216;Morph Potion&#8217; and &#8216;Telescope&#8217;.</p>



<p>«Purchase LV 2 Scouter for 150,000 ¥?»</p>



<p>Of course, a click.</p>



<p>«Purchase Morph Potion for 1,000,000 ¥?»</p>



<p>A little high, but you get a click as well.</p>



<p>«Purchase Telescope for 700,000 ¥?»</p>



<p>Yes, yes, you get a click too.</p>


<p>This way, I ended my shopping. Now comes the utility investigation time. They can&#8217;t possibly be duds can they? My heart palpitating, I read through my &#8216;Owned Items&#8217;.</p>



<p>«Owned Items»<br />«LV 1 Scouter»<br />«LV 2 Scouter»<br />«Master Key»<br />«Sleep Spray»<br />«Camera»<br />«Morph Potion»<br />«Telescope»</p>



<p>I clicked on each item sequentially, checking their details.</p>



<p>«LV 2 Scouter»<br />«Once equipped, will reveal the necessary capture information of the targeted woman being gazed upon.»</p>



<p>The explanation didn&#8217;t really change compared to Scouter LV 1.</p>

<p>«Morph Potion»«One drop»<br />«A drug that will morph you into whoever you want to look like.»<br />«You will only appear different to the capture target.»<br />«You will look like your original form in other people&#8217;s eyes.»</p>



<p>«Telescope»<br />«X-Ray telescope. However, it is impossible to see through thick barriers like walls.»<br />«Can be activated by blinking.»</p>



<p>I can&#8217;t think of a way to use these right away. Moreover, I don&#8217;t like the restriction that I can&#8217;t see through walls. But since they aren&#8217;t duds, I&#8217;ll figure something out as long as I keep them.</p>



<p>I wanted to exit the &#8216;Game Window&#8217;, but then I thought of checking the remaining uses for &#8216;Master Key&#8217;. I haven&#8217;t really used it much so I shouldn&#8217;t need to buy it again, but just to be sure, I should check it. I wanted to check just how the usage was calculated now that I had leveled up.</p>



<p>«Master Key»<br />«Has the ability to open absolutely any kind of door.»<br />«Can be used by touching the window after standing in front of the desired door.»<br />«Remaining Uses: 4 times»<br />«Item enhancement is possible since you have leveled up.»</p>



<p>The remaining uses were indeed 4. I&#8217;m quite disappointed. However, the additional message entered my eyes. Enhancement, you say? Curiosity made me click on the message, followed by another message appearing above it.</p>



<p>«Enhance this item? Enhancement Cost: 100,000 ¥»</p>



<p>The cost seemed reasonable. Then let&#8217;s try it out.</p>



<p>«Enhancement complete.»</p>



<p>Not even a second passed and a completion message popped up.</p>


<p>Curious about what part of it was enhanced, I called upon the details for &#8216;Master Key&#8217;.</p>



<p>«Master Key»«Enhanced 1»<br />«Has the ability to open absolutely any kind of door.»<br />«Can be used by touching the window after standing in front of the desired door.»<br />«Usage Limit: 7 times»<br />-Repurchasing will not change this limit.<br />-Limit restoration is possible if repurchased after level up.</p>



<p>And I saw the usage limit had gone up. Since the very first time I bought it in Level 1, the limit was 6 times. Does this mean that the limit had increased to 7 after enhancement? Does this mean that even after I had used it twice in Level 1, it had now been restored as a service? Haha!</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s so, then it&#8217;s also possible that other items can be enhanced too! Since it said that enhancement was possible after leveling up, thinking that I could also enhance all the other items I bought back in Level 1, I checked the details for &#8216;Sleep Spray&#8217; and &#8216;Camera&#8217; too.</p>



<p>«Sleep Spray»<br />«Just as the name implies, a sleep spray. Boasts incredible performance.»<br />«After touching the item window, simply staring at the target is sufficient.»<br />«Effect Duration: 1 hour»<br />«Range: 1 meters»<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>«1»</sup></a><br />«Item enhancement is possible since you have leveled up.»</p>



<p>«Camera»<br />«X-Ray Camera. Able to take pictures of anything.»<br />«To use, placing the desired frame is your field of vision, and then blinking is sufficient.»<br />«Usage Limit: 1 times»</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if  the &#8216;Camera&#8217; inherently cannot be enhanced, or if the feature will be unlocked once I&#8217;ve leveled up a bit more. Anyway, it was impossible to enhance it in current circumstances. However, it was possible to enhance &#8216;Sleep Spray&#8217;. Without any hesitation, I clicked on the message.</p>



<p>«Enhance Sleep Spray? Enhancement Cost: 100,000 ¥»</p>



<p>The enhancement cost seemed to be decided at 100,000 ¥. I&#8217;m unsure if that&#8217;s cheap or expensive. Anyways, I had the money to spare, so I clicked on the message, firmly.</p>



<p>«Enhancement complete.»</p>



<p>The same message as &#8216;Master Key&#8217; appeared, and I immediately verified the details for it.</p>



<p>«Sleep Spray»«Enhanced 1»<br />«Just as the name implies, a sleep spray. Boasts incredible performance.»<br />«After touching the item window, simply staring at the target is sufficient.»<br />«Effect Duration: 2 hours»<br />«Range: 2 meters»<br />+Enhanced Effect Duration: 1 hour -&gt; 2 hours<br />+Enhanced Range: 1 meter -&gt; 2 meters</p>



<p>Looking at it like this, the result was even more satisfactory than &#8216;Master Key&#8217;. The effect duration wasn&#8217;t anything special, but I really liked that fact that the range expanded. This also means that it&#8217;s safe to assume the range will further increase in the future. If so, then my self-defense has also become more durable. At 1 meters, it&#8217;s pretty much a distance where I can&#8217;t use it unless they&#8217;re right up on my face. I was honestly really worried about the distance when I faced off against the kitchen knife-equipped Sakurai pouncing at me. If it expands to about 5 meters, it&#8217;d be a distance I&#8217;d be able to use at ease. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s still a long way to go.</p>



<p>For the time being, I&#8217;ve bought new items and also attained great weapons after enhancement. It&#8217;s about time I look for a new capture target. After all, time continued to flow even as I was busy with all of this.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.2</strong></p>

<p>However, I was really sleepy. Am I mentally exhausted?</p>



<p>This was a very un-game-like feeling. I&#8217;d say it&#8217;s pretty much impossible to continue capturing forever even whilst being tired. Hunger, the need for sleep, physical needs, everything was exactly like reality. The feeling of being so sleepy that one can&#8217;t even turn their head came over me. It can&#8217;t be helped. Guess I&#8217;ll take a long slumber for the sake of continuing on in this game. Thinking so, I lay down on the bed. And then wrapping myself in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futon">futon</a>, I closed my eyes.</p>



<p>By the time my eyes reopened, 6 hours had already passed. Confirming the time on my phone, I tried moving my groggy body. Let alone feeling refreshed after a long sleep, instead, my head felt insanely heavy. I went to the washroom and filled the basin with water, plunging my head into it.</p>



<p>Thanks to the cold water, the sleepiness died down. Lifting my head up, I looked at myself in the mirror. Despite having increased my Charm by 10 points, I felt like there was no change to my looks. Just what part of me became more charming? I wonder if it&#8217;s that I look different for other people. As if by magic.</p>



<p>Wiping my face with a towel, I returned to my room. The game system gave off its presence with its windows folder-like icon at the corner of my vision. Pulling open the refrigerator, I adequately quelled my hunger. And then I did some stretches.</p>



<p>— Hnnn—gh!</p>



<p>Getting an adequate change of clothes, I put the clothes I took off in the laundry basket and left my house. No matter what, I have to find a capture target soon. This time, my intentions were to scout further away. There&#8217;s downtown if I use the bus. For today, that&#8217;s where my intended destination was. You know, since the furthest I&#8217;ve ever gone after entering this game was but a distance of 5 minutes away to the convenience store.</p>



<p>I also had this weird anxiety of whether the game had only manifested itself in my neighbourhood or not.</p>



<p>Haha. There&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s the case.</p>



<p>While I waited at the bus stop, one arrived very quickly. And within 10 minutes, I arrived at my destination. Somehow, I had this uneasy feeling. Even though I said I&#8217;m in a game, literally everything in here looked completely the same as real life. The bustling crowd walking here and there made me think it was the end of office hours. Even the streets of neon signs were like that of reality.</p>

<p>The only thing different was the «Game System» flickering in front of my eyes.</p>



<p>On the large electronic signboard atop the plaza was the dancing figure of popular idols.</p>



<p>I got a foreboding feeling, looking at her.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s see, shall we try using the scouter?</p>



<p>I was suddenly curious to see if it could lock onto a capture target even though I was looking at a video and not the real thing.</p>



<p>I entered my «Owned Items».</p>



<p>«Owned Items»</p>



<p>«LV 2 Scouter»<br>«Master Key»<br>«Sleep Spray»<br>«Camera»<br>«Morph Potion»<br>«Telescope»</p>



<p>«LV 1 Scouter» had automatically disappeared. Might as well let the scouter be enhanced too, why don&#8217;t ya? Would&#8217;ve been better that way. Why is this the only one that has to be bought separately? It&#8217;s nonsensical. Does it plan to bankrupt me like this? This game is seriously on drugs. While grumbling, I clicked on the scouter. To others, I probably look like a weirdo grumbling on his own whilst moving his fingers in the air.</p>



<p>«Would you like to use LV 2 Scouter?»</p>



<p>And thus, the all too familiar message came out. Upon the electronic billboard, I looked at the idol standing in the center.</p>



<p>Yoshisaki Nika<br>Age: 21 years<br>Relationship Status: Single<br>Occupation: Idol<br>Capture Difficulty: B<br>Residence: Inaccessible at current level<br>Phone Number: Inaccessible at current level<br>Capture Information: Inaccessible at current level<br>Affection Points<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>: 0</p>



<p>The capture information didn&#8217;t appear. The difficulty was surprisingly B. Affection points was an entry that didn&#8217;t exist back in level 1. It must be the addition that comes with «LV 2 Scouter». Affection points were 0. I wasn&#8217;t even acquainted with her, so of course.</p>



<p>Anyhow, I didn&#8217;t even think it would be possible to capture her. And just then, someone bumped into my shoulder making me lose my balance. The culprit was a rather pretty woman. How to say this, let&#8217;s say she looked really refined. That&#8217;s the image she gave off.</p>



<p>Leaning her head down, she apologized to me. Like a goddess. And afterwards, she went along her way. Hurriedly, I used the scouter.</p>

<p>Kitagata Hikaru<br>Age: 24 years<br>Relationship Status: Single<br>Occupation: University Student<br>Capture Difficulty: None<br>Residence: 00 District 00 Street<br>Phone Number: 080-2452-1111<br>Capture Information: None<br>Affection Points: -100</p>



<p>Hm? Capture Difficulty is None?</p>



<p>So it means she wasn&#8217;t a capture target. All her information showed up, but there was no capture difficulty nor capture information.</p>



<p>At that instant, it occured to me.</p>



<p>Just how those words implied, since she didn&#8217;t have any secrets worth making her a capture target, she was just a woman passing by. Meaning, it&#8217;s fine if I don&#8217;t bother with her.</p>



<p>This would mean that the idol just a while ago had some kind of secret worth making her a capture target.</p>



<p>My interest was piqued. However, her difficulty of B makes it impossible to approach her by any means. That is, if I don&#8217;t level up beforehand. Since no capture information appeared, it&#8217;s a given that it would be impossible to capture her.</p>



<p>More importantly, that other woman really made me feel hurt. We simply bumped into each other and her affection points were already at -100? That&#8217;s too much! Even though I added 10 points to Charm, my initial values were lower to begin with so it seems getting a good impression was still very hard.</p>



<p>At least in movies, even after one apologizes, the narration would let you know about their inner grudges. Swinging my head from side to side, going &#8216;Oh, dear,&#8217; in my head, I set off for the station. Too many people had gathered around here.</p>



<p>Having to skip going for a woman whose capture difficulty didn&#8217;t exist, I also had to skip over women whose difficulty was high enough for their capture information to not even be inaccessible.</p>



<p>Searching for a proper capture target turned out to be harder than I thought. While I was in the middle of slouching, a rather charming woman passed by beside me. Just as I was about to light my cigarette, I ended up dropping my lighter right there. Even forgetting to pick it back up, I started to go after her as if I was possessed.</p>



<p>Her face bloomed with innocence. How to put this, you could say she fit my ideals. The pure and innocent types were what men yearned for after all. So when a girl possessed exactly those qualities, of course it&#8217;d hook me in. Furthermore, the style she adorned unbefitting of her pure and innocent face really stood out. In particular, her pelvis was really dazzling.</p>



<p>Since she wore tight jeans, her butt swaying with every step she took was a sight I couldn&#8217;t take my eyes off of. I&#8217;m not a pervert, okay? I&#8217;d like to say it&#8217;s a part of a man&#8217;s instinct. If a body like that happened to pass by your way, of course you&#8217;d like to take a glance at the very least.</p>



<p>The beige that went perfectly with the knitted fabric<a id="s2" href="#n2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> really emphasized her waist. And that&#8217;s when I used the scouter. I didn&#8217;t have any expectations since I was already aware of her high class, but it never hurts to be sure.</p>



<p>Akemine Miyuki<br>Age: 23 years<br>Relationship Status: Polyamorous<a id="s3" href="#n3"><sup>[3]</sup></a><br>Occupation: Broker<br>Capture Difficulty: D<br>Residence: Inaccessible at current level<br>Phone Number: Inaccessible at current level<br>Capture Information: Manages a lot of men.<a id="s4" href="#n4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> Personally acts as a host in social parties. Suspicious social parties, approaching from here is your hint to capture her.<br>Affection Points: 0</p>



<p>And so, I was lucky enough to have the capture information appear. After spending just a few hours in downtown. I finally found a capture target. Luckily, she was also my type. However, I can&#8217;t look at her like a normal woman. Because of these suspicious social parties. If you&#8217;re going to tell me, then explain properly. It&#8217;s too vague!</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.3</strong></p>

<p>Moreover, what&#8217;s with telling me to approach her from the social parties?</p>



<p>This wasn&#8217;t even a proper hint. However, it was indeed the first time the game provided a hint on its own accord. It would be wise to follow it. But I can&#8217;t understand anything with just this. In the end, I still have to search for her residence on my own, and while I&#8217;m at it, whatever information I gather should bring about some kind of plan for me. Without information it&#8217;ll be tough to advance. And so, with my resolve steeled, I started to tail her.</p>



<p>I thought of fumbling around her house at first like I did for Sakurai&#8217;s case. This was the only way to investigate her personal information in a world without the internet. And tracking down her residence was exactly the purpose for tailing her like this. I frantically followed her while keeping some distance between us. And just then, she suddenly stopped in her steps.</p>



<p>Thinking I was found out, I immediately changed where I faced and took out my phone as if I was in a call, all the while giving her sidelong glances, awaiting her reaction. Fortunately, she hadn&#8217;t stopped because she caught on the fact that I was following her. The nervousness made my palm drenched in sweat.</p>



<p>She bent her body over and started to pick something up from the ground. Looks like she didn&#8217;t notice me tailing her, but simply needed to pick up something she dropped. While I was feeling relieved, she suddenly stood back up and started walking.</p>



<p>I too, put back my phone and started to pursue her once again. After walking for about 5 minutes, she stopped in her tracks once again. I quickly hid myself in an alleyway and leaned onto a building wall. And peeking just my head out, I examined her behaviour.</p>



<p>It didn&#8217;t seem like she dropped something this time, seeing her standing there with crossed arms. Noticing her checking the time, she seemed to be waiting for someone. Was it perhaps for her boyfriend?</p>



<p>Now this is a problem. Having to go all the way to their date is a hurdle too high. While I was busy praying that wasn&#8217;t the case, a bunch of rough looking highschoolers approached her. That too, all boys. Whilst talking to her about something, one of them took out an envelope from his bag and handed it over. She received it and hurriedly put it into her bag, followed by handing them something from her pocket, distancing herself from them in a manner that made her seem like she was ready to run away after she was done.</p>



<p>Since she moved away, I&#8217;m not sure if she took something back after the exchange. Let&#8217;s write it down for now in case I forget. It was precisely for these kinds of situations that I brought my memo pad from high school with me. Taking it out from my pocket, I scribbled in whatever I understood so far.</p>



<p>3 high school students.<br>Taking back something.<br>Hurried appearance.</p>



<p>Taking memos while tailing someone makes me somewhat feel like a detective. And shortly after, she started walking once again. Looks like that&#8217;s the end of detective-play. Putting away the memo pad, I followed after her. Soon enough, some densely packed apartments appeared before her. They looked quite high class.</p>



<p>And among them, she entered the one in the middle. Damn, what to do. Do I pretend to be part of the crowd?</p>



<p>While I contemplated it, she entered her pin code in the auto-lock system at the entrance and ended up entering the building. I would&#8217;ve followed her in, but by that time, the entryway door would close shut.</p>



<p>Looks like those scenarios where one has to enter the pic code in order to break in. This was completely different from the old apartment where Sakurai lived. By now, Akemina had already pushed the elevator button. I panicked. I&#8217;ll be troubled if I lose her. At the very least, I have to investigate what her apartment number was.</p>


<p>Should I use the «Master Key» and chase after her? But that would reveal my face. It&#8217;s not preferable to have your face revealed before you even get any info.</p>



<p>Hahaha!</p>



<p>The hell am I worried about?</p>



<p>I have the telescope, don&#8217;t I?</p>



<p>That&#8217;s right, the «X-Ray Telescope». An X-Ray item was exactly what I needed. Moreover, since it&#8217;s called a telescope, it&#8217;d of course have the functionality of zooming in.</p>



<p>By that time, Akemina had already boarded the elevator.</p>



<p>«Would you like to use the Telescope?»</p>



<p>It&#8217;s also an item without any usage limits. I used it without any worries. However, nothing had particularly changed. Now that I mention, I do recall it mentioning something about blinking.</p>



<p>Thus, I blinked. Just once. No change. Wondering why, I tried doing it twice this time. And then suddenly, I see something far away appear really close. Hoh, how interesting. This time, I tried blinking thrice. In doing so, the zoom factor increased further. I could see the elevator panel very clearly. When I blinked 4 times in succession, it appeared as though the panel was right up my face.</p>



<p>Yosh! 5 times now! Blink, blink, blink, blink, blink.</p>



<p>Ahhh, my eyes are gonna cramp!</p>



<p>Even so, there were no changes in the outcome. Looks like the zoom level is limited to 3 steps. Well, even with this, I&#8217;m pretty satisfied. As I walked back and forth in front of the apartment pretending to wait for someone, I continued to keep an eye on the elevator panel, which, at one point, stopped at the fifth floor.</p>



<p>I quickly distanced myself from the apartment. And thus, I found her house by the door she opened on that floor. The outcome turned out all right. Amidst all that, I ended up tripping onto the floor. It was most likely because I moved while the telescope was on. I hadn&#8217;t gotten used to the sense of distance yet. I wonder what I have to do to turn it off.</p>



<p>Even when I tried to read into the «Game System», I couldn&#8217;t see the window at all since the «Telescope» was in use. Would it be alright to try blinking again?</p>



<p>When I blinked thrice, I zoomed out. Moving on, I tried blinking once. Previously, there was no reaction when I blinked once. However, this time…</p>



<p>«Would you like to release the Telescope.»</p>



<p>The message I was looking for finally appeared. I clicked on it without a delay. And at once, the «Game System» returned to the corner of my vision. The sense of distance returned to normal.</p>



<p>I could&#8217;ve gotten seriously hurt if moved without being aware of this! God damn it, this ticked me off!</p>



<p>More importantly, when should I infiltrate her house?</p>



<p>Do I lie in wait until she comes out? In Sakurai&#8217;s case, it was possible for me to keep watch from my house, but it seems thoughtlessly waiting it out here would be quite problematic. Moreover, a waste of time.</p>



<p>It&#8217;d be no different from getting a life sentence. I should value the little time I have.</p>



<p>With that said, it&#8217;s time to bulldoze through. Without letting my face be seen, of course.</p>



<p>Saving right now and commencing my assault, then using the «Sleep Spray» and fishing through her house while she&#8217;s out cold, and finally loading after leaving her house should be a good enough plan. If I do that, then she shouldn&#8217;t be able to remember anything.</p>



<p>«Would you like to save?»</p>



<p>I immediately clicked the message and stood in front of the entranceway.</p>




<p>«Would you like to use the Master Key?»</p>



<p>And thus I entered the place as naturally as possible. Boarding the elevator, I got off at the fifth floor, followed by ringing the doorbell of apartment number 504.</p>



<p>«Who is it?»</p>



<p>I could hear her voice. But her voice was so quiet, I couldn&#8217;t quite hear it properly. I tried to change my voice as much as I could and replied.</p>



<p>«Delivery!»</p>



<p>And thus she opened the door. However, the chain was still latched on. A very natural protective instinct.</p>



<p>«Would you like to use the Sleep Spray?»</p>



<p>And once I was done using it, I immediately changed to a different item after she fell to the floor.</p>



<p>«Would you like to use the Master Key?»</p>



<p>Good, good.</p>



<p>Nodding to myself, I clicked the message and opened the door. Luckily, there&#8217;s no camera on the corridor. No, would the camera even capture me in the first place? That in itself was another issue.</p>



<p>The reason for that issue stemmed back to my case with Sakurai. There, I thought the cops would pay me a visit, but then didn&#8217;t. A surveillance camera was installed in her elevator. That&#8217;s why, the cops had plenty of reason to knock at my door as a potential suspect.</p>



<p>However, the reason for why they never came was probably due to the game system wanting to safeguard the incident of the master key being used. In other words, any traces left behind by the actions for the sake of capturing would be erased by the game system as protection. Although, it will also forcibly dispatch the cops if any seriously illegal acts such as rape was to be enacted. Meaning, the system was pretty much a double-edged sword.</p>



<p>Protection and legal action coexisted together.</p>



<p>Since the master of this parallel world was the game system, it also meant that it could possibly move the police however it wanted to.</p>



<p>Hence, I think it should be fine to move more boldly, but I&#8217;m still not convinced.</p>



<p>Anyhow, how the time being, I opened the door and entered the house.</p>



<p>I&#8217;ll be loading back anyway, so there&#8217;s no need to be worried about this.</p>



<p>This time, I didn&#8217;t make any indication of touching her. It&#8217;d be a pain if I trigger the legal action again.</p>



<p>Oddly, I didn&#8217;t spot any kind of photos put around that were all too commonplace after I entered. This extra-wide room was pretty dull. The same went for the kitchen. The tabletop was incredibly clean. Nothing was put on it. Even though the debt notices atop Sakurai&#8217;s dining table played a huge role in the capture, it was unfortunate this time.</p>



<p>The kitchen too, it was so unnaturally spotless that I couldn&#8217;t find any oddities. At the very least, it would seem she didn&#8217;t hide any bodies in her home. She had a total of 3 rooms and as soon as I entered one of them, I was met with a bunch of western style clothing. Looks like it&#8217;s a walk-in closet. From western clothing to bags, and then even accessories such as rings and necklaces were set neatly set on display. All of them seemed like brand items. Wasn&#8217;t this a little too extravagant for a 23 year old?</p>



<p>Exiting the room, I entered the bedroom next. There was a one-person bed and a dresser, but yet again, it seemed even this place was filled with tonnes of branded cosmetics, but other than those, I saw nothing out of the ordinary. I thus entered the one remaining room. There was a desk, behind which were several boxes piled up. Was this a room she used as a storage? Compared to the bedroom and walk-in closet, this one was bland.</p>



<p>The desk here seemed just as clean as the table outside. Not even a single book was on it. I opened all the drawers it had, but only the last one I pulled had a single book that appeared to be some kind of a diary.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.4</strong></p>

<p>I sat on the desk and started to read the diary. If you keep nothing but a diary in an otherwise empty desk, then obviously this&#8217;d reek of plot.</p>



<p>Looking at its contents, it seemed to be a diary of her high school days. It&#8217;s just… the contents weren&#8217;t normal. It expressed her life full of suffering. And the further I continued to the later pages, the darker it got.</p>



︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>I want to die.</p>



<p>Why do I have to suffer all of this?</p>



<p>I got drenched in the toilet.</p>



<p>Without any change of clothes, I could do nothing but cry.</p>



<p>The teacher harshly scolded me for skipping classes.</p>



<p>It hurts so much, I resent it all!</p>



<p>Just what the hell should I do?</p>



<p>If I didn&#8217;t give her the money by tomorrow, she said she&#8217;d sell me over to men.</p>

<p>She is too scary.</p>



︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>That was the contents in the last page. And slipped into this portion was a picture, something that I had been searching throughout the entire house for. It was a picture of Akemine lying down on a sofa, posing together with a bunch of girls that looked like her friends. It&#8217;s just, her facial features were a bit odd. You could even say she had a frightened look on her face.</p>



<p>However, although the diary made it look like she was in a very serious situation, she seemed to be living a relatively fine life now. Would it be alright to assume she ran away after she faced her suffering while living alone?</p>



<p>And to think that such a woman was now someone who managed suspicious social parties… Was it because her body was sold like she mentioned at the end of the diary that she woke up on that side of the bed? And that would be why her personality took a turn.</p>



<p>I still had my issues with this, but now that I was done seeing what I had to, I put the diary back where it was and withdrew myself.</p>


<p>Returning back to the living room, my eyes fell on the bag atop the table. Now that I think about it, the stuff that she exchanged with the highschoolers should be in here, right? And so, in order to confirm what the items were, I opened it. And there it was, several rolls of cash bound by rubber bands.</p>



<p>All of them were 10,000¥ notes, so of course they&#8217;d collectively be an appropriately hefty amount. Damn, this woman just keeps getting more incomprehensible to me. Her purse was also inside the bag. And once I opened it up, rather than finding any money, I found her ID, alongside several business cards stuffed in together with it. Just how many of these cards did she carry, to have them even pile up over the space occupied by her ID?! Just buy a card case already!</p>



<p>While fiddling around with the cards in there, I found something very interesting. A card related to the social parties.</p>



<p>Please join our party.<br>For membership inquiries, contact 080-1111-2222</p>



<p>It had no other contents, just these two lines. But to the current me, wasn&#8217;t this the information I needed the most? She had plenty of other such business cards in her purse. Seems like these would give me huge leads. I wasn&#8217;t even carrying money, so I stuffed it into my pocket.</p>



<p>However, I didn&#8217;t lay a hand on the bundles of cash. Unlike the purse that had nothing but business cards, if it was money, then the game would probably take legal action like it did for Sakurai&#8217;s case. Even if that wasn&#8217;t the case, I had no need to go out of my way to take something that had no relation to my captures. My current object was the capture, not money. No matter how I saw it, this was a trap.</p>



<p>With this, I seemed to have gotten everything I needed, so I decided to &#8216;Load&#8217;. And thus, the blindingly white world enveloped me.</p>



<p>However it was then that I thought I made a blunder. It was about the cards and her purse.</p>



<p>In particular, the business cards were the most crucial aspect of capturing her. I casually rummaged through my pocket.</p>



<p>And strangely enough, the purse, along with the cards, came out.</p>




<p>Unlike the unrealistic items or my savings, it seemed that it was possible to keep anything I take into my possession after I load back. I wonder if this was the strange power trying to preserve my future state when returning to the past.</p>



<p>This was some seriously complicated stuff, but either way, it had nothing to do with the cards. Let us go home, analyse all of this and try contacting the listed number right away then, shall we?</p>



<p>I&#8217;m satisfied that I got to know that membership was a prerequisite to follow the social parties approachment route. With this I&#8217;m one step closer. However, the capture conditions were still in the dark. Well, I should be fine if I just probe around in the parties. After all, it was a hint that the game itself provided.</p>



<p>I returned to downtown once again, and waited for the bus. There, behind the stop, I found a woman sitting down, absentmindedly.<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> She bore shabby clothes. Nevertheless, she didn&#8217;t seem like she was homeless or anything, having no dirt or grime on her. Rather, for some reason, she seemed like she was sparkling. She looked quite young. At most, she was in her early twenties. She had a hood over her head, so I couldn&#8217;t really catch her face properly. Moreover, since she was squatting down, I couldn&#8217;t grasp her figure either. She also gave off the feeling of being a beauty hiding herself in shabby attire. I bet she&#8217;d indeed be a beauty if she wore ordinary clothes. But it was dark, so I had no confidence in that claim, though.</p>



<p>However, since I had already begun Akemine&#8217;s capture, I had absolutely no interest in her at the moment. That&#8217;s why I averted my gaze. And at that moment, as if she was aware of my gaze this whole time, she stood up on the ground and approached me.</p>



<p>Seemed like she had something to say, but she seemed to be squirming around quite a lot.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, Oji-san.&#8221;<a id="s2" href="#n2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>



<p>From saying absolutely nothing, once I looked back over my shoulders, words had finally escaped her mouth. However, among all things, what&#8217;s with the first thing you say being &#8216;Oji-san&#8217;?! No matter how much my Charm was at a mere 22 points, this was just rude! I immediately turned a question back at her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Which oji-san are you talking about?&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing me, she slightly squirmed her body. Following my angry voice, I thought I&#8217;d also end up using violence, so I immediately withdrew myself.<a id="s3" href="#n3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> But then, seeing her, who looked like a little rabbit, the anger that welled up inside me died down before I even realized it. However, whether it was because of my angry tone or her calling out to me first, I didn&#8217;t drop my guard.</p>


<p>&#8220;Fine, I get it. So, what do you want?&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if it was because she called me Oji-san at first, but I ended up speaking to her casually. I guess it should be fine, since we wouldn&#8217;t be encountering each other again afterwards.</p>



<p>&#8220;You were staring at me just a while ago weren&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>Was she going to accuse me of sexual harassment even though all I did was look at her? Remembering the unfair treatment I received in the past, my vigilance naturally sprouted.</p>



<p>&#8220;Won&#8217;t you come sleep with me? I&#8217;ll make it cheap for you.&#8221;</p>



<p>However, what followed were some unexpected words. Understanding her intentions, I used my scouter that instant to gather information. This must also be some kind of trap.</p>



<p>(Name Unknown)<br>Age: 19 years<br>Relationship Status: Inaccessible at current level<br>Occupation: Inaccessible at current level<br>Capture Difficulty: A<br>Residence: Inaccessible at current level<br>Phone Number: Inaccessible at current level<br>Capture Information: Inaccessible at current level<br>Affection Points: Inaccessible at current level</p>



<p>Capture difficulty of A?!</p>



<p>I sincerely doubted the information that appeared before me for a second. Even though she&#8217;s the one who came approaching me, her capture difficulty was actually this high. Besides her age and difficulty, literally everything else was protected.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.5</strong></p>

<p>Even that famous idol had a difficulty of B. And it also displayed her affection points. However, not even this woman&#8217;s name came up. The hell is this.</p>



<p>Even now, as I kept pondering upon these things, the girl awaited my reply. What should I say? If I wasn&#8217;t so stunned at her being ranked A then I&#8217;d honestly have turned her down and returned home. I have no interest in these acts of body selling. However, this girl seemed to really be fidgeting to do something like that. Her attire and speech don&#8217;t match either, so she must be dealing with some issues.</p>



<p>Was this a chance for some kind of event? Although I&#8217;m in the middle of a quest, it&#8217;s not like I wouldn&#8217;t consider grabbing onto an event as well. But on the flip side, there&#8217;s also the possibility of it being a trap. Ah, my head&#8217;s gonna go numb. I&#8217;d be more at ease if the game&#8217;s special characteristics, the choices, came out, but even those aren&#8217;t coming. Even though this was a perfect situation for it to come out…</p>



<p>Choice 1 would be to tag along. Choice 2 would be to return home. Something like that.</p>



<p>But absolutely nothing came out. As I kept hesitating having no choices in display, she still continued to stand there, waiting for me.</p>



<p>Guess I&#8217;ll try messing around a bit. I&#8217;ll give this &#8216;Difficulty A&#8217; a shot. It&#8217;s impossible to capture her at the moment, but someday, it would become possible. No, someday, I&#8217;d have no other choice but to capture her. In that case, it shouldn&#8217;t be a bad idea to approach her in advance. And of course, I&#8217;m not actually thinking of sleeping with her.</p>



<p>It felt so much like the game was leading me on that I didn&#8217;t like it. It&#8217;s like the trap would be sprung before I could even say no.</p>



<p>&#8220;For how much?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I considered that, the moment I thought about answering her, I ended up replying with the worst possible answer. Even though it would&#8217;ve been more appropriate to agree to her proposal for the time being, I couldn&#8217;t just say something like &#8216;Yosh, let&#8217;s go!&#8217; if I were to advance with her, and that&#8217;s what ended up slipping out my mouth. It felt so childish, I might&#8217;ve hurled.</p>


<p>However, as if she was already used to it, she made no changes in her expression and held out two fingers. Two fingers could mean anything. Common sense would tell me it definitely wasn&#8217;t 2,000 ¥.</p>



<p>&#8220;20,000 ¥?&#8221;</p>



<p>Fanning out her two fingers, she nodded and uttered the amount. Looks like I was right. I&#8217;m not quite sure if it&#8217;s expensive or cheap. I had no intention of buying her anyway. Although, it&#8217;s not like it was a sum I couldn&#8217;t pay.</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Once I gave her my consent, she quickly hung her head down.</p>


<p>&#8220;Thank you very much.&#8221;</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>She let out a long breath, stroking herself down her chest. She was out to sell her body, so I wonder why she seemed so timid and kind. Just what kind of circumstances was she dealing with?</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s a love hotel I really like, so would you please follow me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I inadvertently replied so, she turned her back towards me and started walking, with me following behind. Before I knew it, we were already in the downtown red light district. There were plenty of clubs and pubs scattered around the region where all the love hotels were concentrated in. The woman entered the hotel around the corner without faltering in the slightest. Getting a good look at it, seemed like it was true that this was her favorite spot.</p>



<p>Following her inside, I found her waiting for me at the reception desk.</p>



<p>&#8220;Would you please mind paying the bill? The hotel charge is separate, you see…&#8221;</p>



<p>If she makes such a guilty face, even I&#8217;d feel like I&#8217;m doing a good deed. For the time being, I nodded and checked out their catalogs, followed by paying for the room rent. As I got closer to her after getting the keys, she suddenly thrust her hand out.</p>



<p>&#8220;May I please hold on to the keys?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her request was so naturally put out that I reflexively presented it to her. After receiving it, she confirmed the room number and carried herself up the stairs. All the room had was a bed and a bathroom. It was my first time coming to a place like this so I couldn&#8217;t help but restlessly look here and there.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is something the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No…&#8221;</p>



<p>I panicked and ended up choking up something really uncool that moment. She sat on the bed and patted her hand beside her, as if ordering me to sit there. I obediently followed through. Putting me aside, I don&#8217;t think her mannerisms were all that good. If she ever got into trading with that kind of countenance, I don&#8217;t think she&#8217;d get that many customers. After all, this was also a service business, wasn&#8217;t it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shall we start right away?&#8221;</p>



<p>She suddenly started stripping her clothes off. With her parka now taken off, her face and figure now lay in the open. Straight black hair that descended down to her shoulders. Plus, a somewhat cold impression. Moreover, her breasts that were held underneath her bra were surprisingly big. They looked so big, possibly exceeding C-cups, that my gaze naturally affixed itself onto them. Our eyes met, and inadvertently looked away, flustered. And then, my eyes fell onto the traces of a bad scar on her arm.</p>



<img src="https://i0.wp.com/hinjakuhonyaku.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Kusora.Yurea_.full_.2735157-1.jpg?resize=722%2C1024&#038;ssl=1"></img>


<p>Noticing my gaze, she hurriedly covered it up. And thanks to that, as she tried to turn away, I also noticed small traces of the scar on her back too. As if they were scars that were leftovers from being beaten, my breath stopped in its place.</p>



<p>As I suspected, she had her circumstances. She was someone who had to sell her body one way or another. Just what kind of secret did she have to be given an A rank, I wonder.</p>



<p>&#8220;Did… Did you see it?&#8221;</p>



<p>Was it about the scar? If you didn&#8217;t want it to be seen, then turn off the lights before you strip yourself. If you take off your clothes in such a brightly lit place, then there&#8217;s no way I wouldn&#8217;t be able to see something that big. Looks like she was kind of a dunce. After I nodded, she let out a long sigh.</p>




<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s really unpleasant, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>While I hesitated to answer her, she stuck out a single finger as if there was no helping it. With my expression telling her that I didn&#8217;t understand what she meant, she continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll half the price. Of course there are people who dislike scars like this, but I&#8217;m quite skillful with my services. I have plenty of regular customers too.<a id="s2" href="#n2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>&#8220;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if this was commonplace, but her price was suddenly dropped to a half. Even though I didn&#8217;t even say anything yet. But if I were to answer her question of whether it was unpleasant to me, then no. I also have a scar from my student days. It&#8217;s proof that I lived through tough times. There&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d think it&#8217;s unpleasant. That was why… I strongly shook my head. I don&#8217;t know if she thought that was a sign of refusing her, but she started to wear her clothes back one after another.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah… I don&#8217;t… find that unpleasant, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>With her parka pulled down, she stared wide eyed at me as if my reply was something completely unexpected.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes? Just now, what did you…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I said that a burn or a scar was not something unpleasant. It&#8217;s just an injury, after all. It also carries the memories of your hard times. One could even go as far as to say that it carries the proof that you&#8217;ve lived through those memories, so why would it be unpleasant?<a id="s3" href="#n3"><sup>[3]</sup></a>&#8220;</p>



<p>Unable to find the words to convey back to me, we passed some time in silence. She stared at me without blinking. It was also kind of starting to feel like she was glaring at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s… what the other uncles<a id="s4" href="#n4"><sup>[4]</sup></a> and everyone have said to me as well.&#8221;</p>



<p>And so, she started to strip herself once again. &#8216;I don&#8217;t care about what you have to say, so let&#8217;s just have sex&#8217; was what I understood from her.</p>



<p>— Rank A<br>— Choices that weren&#8217;t coming out<br>— A woman who invites people to sleep with her<br>— An unbefitting act of fidgeting and squirming around, and also the attire that made her look like she was going through something<br>— Plus, her beauty and figure<a id="s5" href="#n5"><sup>[5]</sup></a><br>— Moreover, her scar</p>



<p>I didn&#8217;t have the intention to do her from the get go, so the more I looked at it, the more I&#8217;m convinced it&#8217;s a trap. There&#8217;s only so much good stuff that&#8217;s given away for free. It&#8217;s possible that if I actually do have sex with her right now, I&#8217;d end up in a huge disadvantage. The game&#8217;s trap. That&#8217;s when I built up my courage and spoke out. From the very beginning, I never liked the idea of buying women. If that hadn&#8217;t been the case, I&#8217;d have graduated from my virginity a long time ago.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, don&#8217;t take off your clothes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying that, I gently grabbed her arm in the midst of her act. Accordingly, she looked at me as if she was unable to comprehend the meaning behind my conduct.</p>



<p>&#8220;Have you changed your mind? Although you said you didn&#8217;t find it unpleasant a while ago…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not what… Anyways, for the time being, take this…&#8221;</p>



<p>I extracted two 10,000 ¥ notes from my wallet and handed them to her palm before starting my explanation.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have no intention of doing it with you. But don&#8217;t misunderstand because of that. It&#8217;s not because of your scar. Rather… I actually think you&#8217;ve got a nice figure…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oji-san… Are you… perhaps an… E… D<a id="s6" href="#n6"><sup>[6]</sup></a>?&#8221;</p>



<p>The woman slightly raised her eyebrows and asked. An expression that clearly said she had absolutely no idea why I was acting this way.</p>



<p>Just as I was thinking about what she meant, I panicked and replied.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I don&#8217;t have any issues with my sexual functions, alright? On the contrary, my libido is large enough that it&#8217;s troublesome.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, why are you only giving me the money?&#8221;</p>



<p>This time, when I handed out the money to her, she stood up from the bed.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re feeling pity for a woman selling her body, then I don&#8217;t need this.&#8221;</p>



<p>She was someone who&#8217;d even cut the price in half, which would imply she was in need for money. However, she wouldn&#8217;t take sympathy money, huh. Was her pride high? The more I talked to her, the more strange she seemed. Once again, I was made to freshly recall Sakurai who wouldn&#8217;t hate to kill for the sake of a few million yen.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not the issue. But in that case… how about we do this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What would it be?&#8221;</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t know if she thought I&#8217;d be making an impossible request, but she frowned at me. She definitely looks like she&#8217;s thinking that. And that&#8217;s where I made an outrageous proposal that would completely overthrow what she was expecting.</p>



<p>&#8220;Would you like to join me for a meal outside now? It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve eaten together with someone, and having a meal with a pretty girl like you, I feel even that much would be a good deal for me.&#8221;</p>



<p>I made an excuse for the apparently needy girl and also mixed in some truth along with it. However, with the trace urges to run away tugging at me, I turned around and made my way to the reception. As I waited for her at the exit, she climbed down the stairway.</p>



<p>&#8220;To think that you left without even hearing my answer.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you bring the money I left in the room along with you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, for the time being…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then since you&#8217;ve accepted the money, I should be compensating you accordingly, shouldn&#8217;t I? Shall we make our way to the eateries, then?&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, we exited the love hotel. She followed behind me with a &#8216;it can&#8217;t be helped&#8217; look. The situation was the complete opposite from a while ago. Meaning, the scenario where I was the one following her into the love hotel.</p>



<p>Since it was the red light district, there were restaurants scattered here and there. However, I was someone with no history of having a meal alone with a girl. I have no idea which place would be most suitable.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you have anything you want to eat in particular?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes? In that case… There!&#8221;</p>



<p>For some reason, she was even more flustered than I was. She looked around her surroundings and shot out her finger at a signboard.</p>



<p>&#8220;The ramen over there! Or as it says…&#8221;</p>



<p>It felt like her eyes were sparkling the moment she screamed &#8216;Ramen!&#8217;, but immediately after, her voice simmered down again. No, but really… ramen?</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.6</strong></p>

<p>No matter how much I haven&#8217;t ever gone out with a girl before, I&#8217;m pretty sure that going for ramen on a date was out of place. Nothing but the images of high class restaurants would appear in one&#8217;s head.</p>



<p>But now that I think about it, I&#8217;ve never said that this&#8217;d be a date. Moreover, she already started to walk her way towards the ramen restaurant. And so, with nothing to do but to obey this simple proposal, I entered the dining room as well and took my seat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it really alright for me to not return this money? I&#8217;ve never heard of someone paying 20,000 ¥ simply to have a meal with someone.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, if those things happen, so would this… Anyways, let&#8217;s drop the money talk.&#8221;</p>



<p>As she kept staring at me intently, she finally nodded her head, surrendering to me. Only, her gaze this time made it seem like she still had her doubts.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s my first time meeting someone like Oji-san. After seeing my scars, you didn&#8217;t have sex with me, and yet you still gave me the money. And here, saying you only wanted to have a meal together is really strange…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, rather… I&#8217;m not an oji-san. I&#8217;m still only 25 years old.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I said that while ordering two bowls of miso ramen, she looked at me dumbfoundedly and asked again.</p>



<p>&#8220;25 years? Ehhh—?&#8221;</p>




<p>&#8220;What.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I thought you&#8217;d be 30…&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing her say that so boldly, my hand that was pouring water trembled with anger. I know I don&#8217;t have a baby face, but aren&#8217;t you a little too frank? Look, you made me spill the water all over the table.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, I&#8217;m kidding. Even so, since you&#8217;re 6 years older than me, &#8216;Oji-san&#8217; should still be fine, right.&#8221;</p>



<p>Making a face as if she committed a blunder, she corrected herself. But you&#8217;re too late. If I were to have Affection Points regarding her right now, I would say it would be at -1000 already.</p>


<p>I give up. As I resigned myself, I realized there wasn&#8217;t really anything to talk about, so I tried asking for her name. Since not even her name appeared in the scouter, there isn&#8217;t any other way but to ask her directly.</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s your name?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;My name?&#8221;</p>



<p>She looked like she was somewhat troubled by it, wondering if she should say it or not. Just as I thought, women are indeed fickle creatures. Even getting their name out is an insurmountable task. Even more so if it&#8217;s a woman with charm similar to her. Just when I thought I reached a setback, she suddenly opened her mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kusora Yurea.&#8221;</p>



<p>I also told her my name clearly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Aah. I&#8217;m Hasegawa…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I didn&#8217;t particularly ask for it, though?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, yes, that&#8217;s right, isn&#8217;t it. I apologize…&#8221;</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>My confidence was boosted thanks to being able to get her name out, but she immediately shot it back down again. As I looked at her after having lost grip of this conversation, I wasn&#8217;t sure if my facial expression gave it away, but I got a hold of myself amidst the puzzlement.</p>




<p>&#8220;Fufu, this time it was actually a joke. So then, your full name would be?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hasegawa Ryou.&#8221;</p>



<p>And with that, our order was brought to the table. I don&#8217;t know if she was really listening to me or not, but I received the ramen. No, I&#8217;m sure she actually heard it. She&#8217;s just pretending to ignore it. I grabbed the chopsticks. As she stared at her serving intently, she also grabbed her chopsticks following my motion.</p>



<p>And then, as I expected, when I started to put the noodles into my mouth, she copied my actions again. Just what is she doing?</p>



<p>Afterwards, after she took in a mouthful of it, she started to slurp and chow down on her own. Don&#8217;t tell me she didn&#8217;t know how to eat it this whole time? That can&#8217;t be it, but… her actions are pretty strange.</p>



<p>Although, she seems to be enjoying it, so I&#8217;m happy for her. Was she on an empty stomach?</p>



<p>&#8220;Are you not going to eat…?&#8221;</p>



<p>She stopped her chopsticks in their tracks once she noticed me staring at her.</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I will.&#8221;</p>



<p>And so, once I started to sip spoonfuls of the soup, she resumed her meal once again. Her speed made it seem as if she was someone who had spent several days without eating. Before I realized it, I could see the bottom of her bowl. Of course I&#8217;ll be eating, but just so that I don&#8217;t end up too slow, the two of us left our bowls clean at approximately the same time.</p>



<p>&#8220;You done?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, thank you for the meal.&#8221;</p>



<p>Giving me a slightly awkward bow of gratitude, she took out her portion of the bill from the money I had given her. Very quickly, I pushed her hand back and took out 1400 ¥, paying for both our food.</p>



<p>&#8220;I could at least pay for the food. You even gave me money after all…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s all fine as long as you enjoyed it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;U—m…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, let us bid our farewells, shall we?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Will you really be going back like this? If you want, I can still…&#8221;</p>



<p>How many times is she going to say the same thing again and again? I quickly put a finger on my lips and gestured her to shush as a reply. Afterwards, trying to appear cool, I waved my hand and bid farewell, walking out of the area.</p>



<p>Including the love hotel charge, I spent 28,400 ¥. It didn&#8217;t particularly feel like a waste. What a strange feeling. Compared to the price of items, this wasn&#8217;t anything special. That&#8217;s why I decided to forget thinking about that woman.</p>



<p>In the first place, she was not someone I could get closer to at the moment.</p>



<p>I felt more at ease having the liberty to forget about her rather than getting caught in the trap.</p>



<p>As I took a shower after reaching home, I slowly tried to forget that girl that kept going around my head and started to find ways to approach Akemine instead.</p>



<p>Actually, I didn&#8217;t really need to think much about it. After all, didn&#8217;t I already acquire the business card to enter the social parties? Done with showering, I opened up the purse I brought with me and took them out.</p>



<p>00 Group<br>President<br>Washino Towa</p>



<p>00 Group<br>Managing Director<br>Hazahara Yasumasa</p>



<p>00 Entertainments Office<br>Representative<br>Ariga Masaya</p>



<p>Excluding the membership inquiry cards, everything else was just regular business cards. Membership in a social party, huh. Lining them all up in a row, I noticed that all of cards belonged to names pretty high up the societal ladder.</p>



<p>And of course, the most important would be this card.</p>



<p>Please become a member of our party.<br>For membership queries, contact 080-1111-2222</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.7</strong></p>

<p>I grabbed my phone. Guess I&#8217;ll try inquiring with them. I have no time to hesitate. But still, I feel anxious. Taking a deep breath, I dialed the number and pressed the call button. And as soon as the call connected, I was able to hear a voice from the other end.</p>



<p>This was the first time I was able to make a phone call ever since I entered this world. As expected, as long as it&#8217;s taken from the game, then it&#8217;s possible to call as many contacts as I want.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221;</p>



<p>I heard a woman&#8217;s voice. I wonder if it&#8217;s Akamine herself. Thinking so, I made my inquiry.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello? I got a card from an acquaintance and I had some queries regarding the membership.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I apologize, but could you tell me who introduced us to you? If there haven&#8217;t been any introductions, then the membership process will be stricter.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just what was so complex about this. As I pondered on what to do, the cards lined up on my bed came into view.</p>



<p>&#8220;I got the card from Ariga-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>Even if I get found out some day, I gave the name from a suitable card with the thought of trying something out for the time being. From then, there was a period of silence from the other side of the call. The reply came after about 1 minute.</p>


<p>&#8220;I am the one in charge, Kimoto Ririsa. It&#8217;s true that Ariga-san is a member of our social party, but… How about this. It is required to have an interview for the being, so why don&#8217;t we meet up in person? Please bring the card that you received from Ariga-san as well.&#8221;</p>



<p>After telling me the time and place for the interview, the woman named Kimoto, started to ask me about my personal information. After I carelessly let out my real name, she cut the call with an &#8216;understood&#8217;. Kimoto, huh. It wasn&#8217;t Akamine. A sponsor wouldn&#8217;t come out for these kinds of calls.</p>



<p>When I opened my eyes, it was morning. Looks like I ended up falling asleep at some point. As I pondered over all the troubles that were stirring up in my head, I fell asleep before I even realized it. The sunlight that peeked through the gaps in my window let me know that it was morning. I hurriedly got up and opened my phone. The appointed time was 10 AM. And I only had 1 hour till then. Panicking, I washed my face and took out a suit that I had only worn thrice prior.</p>



<p>Something they call social parties. And also an interview.</p>



<p>No matter how I saw it, it felt like money would be needed whether it was to gain membership or to approach her, so I took out a passbook. Even though I can take out a large sum from the ATM, there&#8217;s still a limit, so it&#8217;s better to take a passbook along.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>Since I don&#8217;t have political power unlike the others, would I be able to get closer to her if I boast about my money?</p>



<p>Packing up my things, I put on my suit, got on the bus and headed towards the subway. And getting off the subway, I headed towards the designated cafe. With 5 minutes remaining until the promised time, I finally found it. Since it was still morning, the place was empty excluding one customer. A woman with her back faced in my direction.</p>



<p>There&#8217;s no mistaking that she&#8217;s the person that came to meet me. Thinking it was the one I talked to the day prior, I got closer. However, before I could even properly confirm her face, I was surprised.</p>



<p>The woman sitting there was definitely Akamine. Was the person who received the call yesterday really just a person in charge of membership inquiries? I never thought Akamine herself would come, but finding it more convenient for myself, I called out to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello. Are you perhaps the one taking the interview?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Would you be Hasegawa-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>I ended up using my actual name yesterday, so it looks like it was relayed over to her as well. As I nodded she gestured me to sit on the opposite side of the table. You&#8217;re telling me to sit? Guess I shall sit. Nodding, I drew back the chair opposite to her and seated myself.</p>



<p>As soon as I did, she immediately presented her palm.</p>



<p>&#8220;To start off, would you please show me the card you were given?&#8221;</p>



<p>With no name nor introduction, starting off with an order right off the bat, huh. It kinda pisses me off, but I&#8217;m in no place to do anything but deal with it, so I obediently took out two cards from my pocket and handed them over. The one that held the lie about Ariga being my acquaintance and the one that carried the message for membership inquiries. She who received my cards started to examine it here and there. Looks like she was trying to figure out if it was forged or not.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no mistaking that the card is genuine. However, when I called Ariga-san yesterday and asked him about it, he said he had no recollection of Hasegawa-san, so would you mind giving me an explanation for this?&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing her words made me reflexively gulp. Well of course she would call him for confirmation. Looks like I really didn&#8217;t think through this properly.<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> Her gaze turned sharp. For her to be able to make such an expression even with her innocent face, it surprised me. Since it came to this, I decided to act a little shameless.</p>



<p>&#8220;Excuse me? After hearing about this association, I definitely wanted to join it, but I received a referral through an intermediary, so I can&#8217;t explain the details. However, since I also run underground operations, I need personal connections as well as women. I have plenty of money so I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;d be a bother to the association. And besides, that card is the real deal. There&#8217;s no way such a thing would be given out to someone who wasn&#8217;t trustworthy. And since I was indeed such a person, I received the introduction.&#8221;<a id="s2" href="#n2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>



<p>Hearing my words, she frowned a little whilst thinking about something.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who would that person be? Would you let me confirm it please?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s confidential information. However, you have no reason to worry. I don&#8217;t run fair and straightforward affairs myself, so there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;d leak something like this association into the open.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unsuspicious businesses. Underground operations. I don&#8217;t know much about these things, but leaving out the internet tongue, I bragged about it with confidence. If it still doesn&#8217;t work with this, guess there&#8217;s no helping it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, the membership fees for our association is 1 million yen, cash in hand. Moreover, you would have to pay a further 1 million every time to attend. Ah, and you need to pay the membership fees up front.&#8221;</p>



<p>1 million yen in hard cash. Surely she&#8217;s testing me right now. Looks like I&#8217;m out the moment I say I can&#8217;t arrange it. It would be strange if I couldn&#8217;t arrange that kinda money after all that boasting. It&#8217;s kind of on the expensive side, but if it&#8217;s 1 million, then yeah, I can prepare.<a id="s3" href="#n3"><sup>[3]</sup></a> It&#8217;s about the price of an &#8216;Item&#8217;. It&#8217;s kind of a waste, but when I think that I&#8217;d recover from it after clearing this whole thing, it starts to feel like an indispensable fund.</p>




<p>&#8220;There are no issues. If it&#8217;s that much, then I can hand them over right away.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Truth be told, in the case we cannot identify the referrer, we take this membership fee as a guarantee. If you gain membership after properly revealing your referrer, then there&#8217;s no problem in exempting you from the membership charges.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, she looked at her watch. And I… helplessly stood up.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be right back.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nodding behind her, I walked out of the cafe and headed to the bank. I did think money would be needed, but I damn well didn&#8217;t think it would be as much as 1 million. Anyway, I rushed to the bank, withdrew the cash, and handed Akamine the bundle in front of her.</p>



<p>&#8220;1 million. Please confirm it.&#8221;</p>



<p>After making an arrogant face, she counted it and continued to speak as she put it into her bag.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s all right. Congratulations on becoming a member of our association. Our objective… is gender liberation, and to fully experience said liberation, our participants develop personal connections amongst each other. In other words, it would be an orgy.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. I have high expectations then.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ll be able to meet splendid politicians, and although you would need money to book a room to engage in solicitation, let&#8217;s just leave it at this being a place splendid enough to allow someone to meet people like that without hindrances and bid our farewells, shall we?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. Well…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Very well, then. Come to this place at 7 PM along with your participation fees.&#8221;</p>



<p>She handed a letter of invitation to me that had the location written down in it. The letter had absolutely no sentences, but only a map of the location drawn onto it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, then. Let us meet again at night.&#8221;</p>



<p>Grabbing the bad she had put my money into, Akamine turned around and left without sparing another glance. Looks like I was able to become a member somehow, but now what? Do I not have to expose this association to the world? I still don&#8217;t understand what the capture conditions are. The Capture Information only stated her involvement in the social parties and that I have to approach her through it.</p>



<p>Guess I&#8217;ll try attending the association for now. However, there&#8217;s still quite a while until the appointed time. And their place is also in the neighbourhood. Going back home would be pointless in various ways. And thus to find a place where I could kill some time, I started to loiter around.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>At the corner of the multi-story building where it had been reconstructed was where the social party office was located. Sitting in the VIP room was Shigemichi Kageharu, who was, let&#8217;s just say Akamine&#8217;s first lover.</p>



<p>&#8220;He brought 1 million yen for the occasion?&#8221;</p>



<p>As Shigemichi said so, touching the bundle, Akamine nodded in reply.</p>



<p>&#8220;Indeed. Although he hid the identity of his referrer, since he seemed to have money, I let him in.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;d be troubled if you start bringing in the masses to this as well, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You have no need to worry. It&#8217;s only money.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuu—n, shall we start bringing in the dough with the drugs, then?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, he looked like someone who didn&#8217;t have a referrer and only somehow got a hold of a card, so it would be the best if he simply gets addicted to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;This better not cause problems in the future.&#8221;</p>



<p>Akamine giggled at Shigemichi&#8217;s words, with the face that said &#8216;You&#8217;re worrying too much&#8217;.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, how long do you plan on holding out? You&#8217;ve invested quite a lot, so why not proceed further a little?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No worries. I&#8217;ll be finishing up real quick. Will the woman sent out for the politician be able to&nbsp; prepare it by tomorrow?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, the girl&#8217;s been selling well recently, so I&#8217;ve left her to deal with Ariga-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good, good. Rip off the suspicious ones of their money with drugs, and extract the wealth off of the upper brass with women… Fuhaha! Although it&#8217;s thanks to the effectiveness of your drugs that made it possible for us to reach this stage.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing his words, Akamine frowned and complained.</p>



<p>&#8220;Could you please not say it like that? It irritates me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even though these social parties are where you make personal connections, if you think about it like that, these criminals are seriously screwed up in their heads.&#8221;<a id="s4" href="#n4"><sup>[4]</sup></a></p>



<p>Saying that, the man stood up from the couch. Grabbing his suit jacket, he made his way outside.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah. I won&#8217;t be seeing you off though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Suit yourself.&#8221;</p>



<p>Waving his hand back, the man exited the VIP room, leaving Akamine in there by herself.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.8</strong></p>


<p>When the appointed time finally came before I realized, I nervously headed towards the building that was mentioned on the paper Akamine handed me. It was at the topmost floor. After I ascended using the elevator, I found her waiting outside.</p>



<p>&#8220;Good evening.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a bit late. If you delay then you&#8217;re automatically out, so please be careful next time, alright?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, I apologize. It&#8217;s my first time, so.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I shall look past it this time.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s quite the attitude. It pisses me off, but I&#8217;ll hold it in for the sake of the capture.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, yeah. And here, take it.&#8221;</p>



<p>She walked forward to take the 1 million I presented, and when I surveyed her surroundings, what I found was a world for beasts. It could be said that it was a jungle where several naked men and women were piled up over one another in all directions.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hoho, this is what I meant when I said gender liberation. You can enjoy your partner to your heart&#8217;s content. You could also say it&#8217;s a paradise for men.&#8221;</p>



<p>Explaining so, she showed me around.</p>



<p>&#8220;Since it&#8217;s your first time, would you please come over here?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I followed her, I was led to a place having room doors on both sides. With not even a single room number attached, they simply plain ol&#8217; doors. Encompassing an entire floor in such a large building for their needs, this was seriously on quite the scale. Excluding the VIP rooms at the furthest back, none of the rooms had any number plates. She guided me to the third room on the left and entered.<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>



<p>And thus, she lay me on top of the bed and straddled me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome to heaven.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, she suddenly brought her face closer to mine. Am I about to do it with this woman? I have no idea what&#8217;s what in this situation anymore. However, right at that moment, I heard a voice that felt familiar.</p>



<p>&#8220;Madam!<a id="s2" href="#n2"><sup>[2]</sup></a> They&#8217;re looking for you in the VIP room. Please leave matters here to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I raised my head, my eyes shot wide open. Astonishingly, the one before my eyes was the girl I met yesterday, Kusora Yurea.</p>



<p>&#8220;It seems something has come up, so please excuse me for now. I sincerely apologize. Instead, I shall leave your first time with this girl as your companion. Afterwards, please do whatever you want to any woman who piques your interest. Hoho.&#8221;</p>



<p>After that, she pulled Kusora Yurea&#8217;s hand and headed outside. Seems like they&#8217;re talking about something. Afterwards, Kusora Yurea headed back to my bed once again without any delay. Confirming that Akamine left, I asked her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why are you here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;More importantly, why is Oji-san in a place like this? I was really surprised when I noticed it was you. It was quite difficult to make an excuse so I could come here, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, she closed the door and led me to the bed. And there, she continued on as she embraced me.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>&#8220;The door can&#8217;t be locked, so it would be suspicious if someone suddenly entered. We need to pretend we&#8217;re doing something, so please lie down on the bed for the time being.&#8221;</p>



<p>I was eternally baffled at her appearance in such a situation, but she had a point, so I obediently lay down on the bed for now. From what she said, it kind of felt she was here to save something.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oji-san, the representative said that you joined here today. How on earth did you get caught in that woman&#8217;s paws?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No! You&#8217;re wrong. Don&#8217;t misunderstand. I didn&#8217;t come here wanting to participate in an orgy. I had something to investigate, so…&#8221;</p>



<p>I naturally started to make excuses. I don&#8217;t know if she believed me, but she nodded after what I said and took out a capsule drug from underneath her dress.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, in the end, since Oji-san didn&#8217;t do it with me yesterday, I&#8217;ll believe you. But it was about to turn into a serious situation just now, you know? Do you see this? Just a moment ago, when the representative brought me outside, she instructed me to make sure I made you take this…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What… is that?&#8221;</p>



<p>I asked her as I was thinking about how suspicious it was to suddenly take out a capsule, when she started explaining with a really serious expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a drug completely different from the drugs that&#8217;s normally circulated around the world. Once this is taken, a normal man wouldn&#8217;t be able to act against her words.&#8221;</p>



<p>And she told you to make me inject such a thing?</p>



<p>There are plenty of suspicious aspects about this, but does this mean that she had decided to make me blow my money from the very beginning?</p>



<p>Was it because the fact that I hid my referrer&#8217;s identity was a problem?</p>


<p>So it was the routine of where they let me in but didn&#8217;t trust me.</p>



<p>I wonder if it would&#8217;ve been possible to load back while not properly conscious due to the drug. Suddenly my head started to hurt. Thinking that such a woman even exists, I was seething with rage. As I thought continued to think about that, Kusora Yurea suddenly swallowed the drug. Startled, I raised my voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;Why did you—!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m fine. Although this is a drug, strangely enough, it doesn&#8217;t affect women.&#8221;</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.9</strong></p>


<p>Feeling relieved, I replied. However, why was this woman before me revealing everything to me so honestly? More than that, what was she doing here? As I was overwhelmed by several issues that simultaneously popped in my mind, I shook my head from side to side to calm myself down and proceeded to inquire about one topic at a time.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve asked you this before, but… why are you here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If one tries to sell their body in this city, then they can&#8217;t escape the representative&#8217;s grasp… She&#8217;s a big shot in the sex industry after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>Her expression as she spoke seemed sorrowful somehow. She does have her own share of circumstances. Immediately in the next instant, she started to warn me again without any kind of expression on her face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oji-san, let&#8217;s not talk about me. More importantly, this place doesn&#8217;t simply have the representative but also countless yakuza managing it. If they catch wind of you not taking the pill, you&#8217;ll be in big trouble. She&#8217;ll return again after a while so try to act like you&#8217;re out of it as much as you can at that time. I think it&#8217;s best if you pretend you&#8217;re being embraced by her, since that&#8217;s what most people end up doing thanks to the medicinal effect being too strong for first timers.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, I&#8217;ll do that. Thank you.&#8221;</p>



<p>Anyways, the info she just gave me was pretty useful intel, whether I go for the attack after a &#8216;Load&#8217; or if I continue to proceed further. Although, I still haven&#8217;t obtained concrete clues regarding the capture, so I guess I&#8217;ll continue on a little. If it seems too dangerous, I&#8217;ll load back without a second thought.</p>



<p>As I considered all of these, the figure of Kusora Yurea appeared before me once again. Unlike the previous day, she had proper makeup on this time. Her hair also properly tied up, it surprisingly suited her. It was completely different from her appearance yesterday! Thanks to that, the beauty she originally possessed shone even more brightly.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s about time she returns, so I&#8217;ll be sitting on top of your body, okay? Ah, and if you want, we could even have sex while we&#8217;re at it, so willl you do it? There&#8217;s also the matter of yesterday&#8217;s money, so…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, that&#8217;s…&#8221;</p>



<p>I panicked and waved my hand side to side. There&#8217;ll be an even bigger problem if I touch this A ranked woman, and that fact hasn&#8217;t changed even now. I&#8217;m grateful that you&#8217;re helping me, but this is a game. I have no idea when I might spring a trap. And to think that I&#8217;d be able to have sex with an A rank so easily… There&#8217;s no way! Even more so if it&#8217;s such a dazzling beauty! Such a&nbsp; situation itself was so explosively great that there&#8217;s no mistaking that this was an A rank. If I proceed deeper into this from the current situation, then there&#8217;s no doubt I&#8217;d be swept away by its current with no way of turning back.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>It&#8217;s true that she&#8217;s saving me and although I do wish to properly settle the situation with her after reaching an appropriate level, now wasn&#8217;t that time.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. As expected, you really are a weird oji-san…&#8221;</p>



<p>As she said so, she stripped her clothes off. A white dress similar to that of Akamine&#8217;s, but underneath that, was nothing but a single piece of clothing.</p>



<p>&#8220;As you might have guessed, I always treat my partners with my clothes on thanks to the numerous scars on my body, but we must make it seem like we&#8217;re doing something so I&#8217;ll be stripping, alright.&#8221;</p>



<img src="https://i0.wp.com/hinjakuhonyaku.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/05/EHvgr3WW4AEoq9h.png?resize=722%2C1024&#038;ssl=1"></img>


<p>And so, placing her butt on my abdomen, she sat in place. It was really an irresistible position, but this location was something different. Being in a first-rate dangerous situation, I somehow kept a hold on my reasoning and continued to ask.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, why did you decide to save me? Wouldn&#8217;t it be in your best interests to have simply let me be? What are you going to do if you get caught?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you treat me to a meal for no reason yesterday? Just returning the favor. I was pretty much forced into coming here and I&#8217;m not even receiving any payment so that&#8217;s pretty much it. Simply think of it as you being lucky. After all, this is really quite the terrifying place.&#8221;</p>



<p>And then at the corner of her eyes, I think I noticed a small tear forming. It seems like she was scared at the fact that she couldn&#8217;t come and go as she pleased in her current situation. Even as she spoke, her arms were slightly trembling. Such cases were pitiful anywhere. In this world, the women always cold-heartedly used me. This is the first time a woman considered saving me like this without asking for any compensation. However, despite the gratefulness I was feeling, my member hardened on its own as a physiological response.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara? So you really weren&#8217;t an ED after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ye… Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just as I thought, shall we proceed?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, that feeling&#8217;s for something different.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;In that case, please pretend to be disoriented when the representative returns. As I&#8217;ve mentioned before, the medicinal effect is pretty strong so that happens from time to time, so if you fall down, I shall lie you down appropriately and let you fall asleep, alright? According to my experience so far, that&#8217;s what happens. Afterwards, in the next meeting, they&#8217;ll expect you to demand the medicine again, but you&#8217;ll be sent back without any, so I believe it will be better if you leave without getting involved with them again.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, I wonder. I have things to investigate so I have no choice but to come. But of course I&#8217;m grateful for you helping me, and since I have no choice but to slip out from here at some point, I&#8217;ll try using the method you gave me. By the way, could we meet again? I&#8217;d like to hear more about this place.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Did you not hear what I just said? This place is dangerous, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>She said so, seemingly genuinely worried about me. However, I needed her information. I wanted to hear everything she knew about the truth of this place. And I also wanted to pay her back for saving me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand. But I&#8217;m not someone lacking in that much power, you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I said so earnestly, she stared fixedly at me. Of course I&#8217;m pretty much powerless excluding the items, but I kind of wanted to boast a little. And so, the marks of her scars suddenly appeared in my vision. Perhaps she noticed me staring, but as she covered them up with her hand, she opened her mouth again.</p>



<p>&#8220;In that case, let us meet again at 7 AM at the same place we first met later. Do you remember?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course. It&#8217;s only been a day after all.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I replied, Akamine returned to the room having completed her tasks. And then the two of us mutually made our performance, embracing each other and starting to pant and gasp for breath. Soon enough, as if it was all over, Kusora Yurea got off from the bed and spoke to her fully composed.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve made him take the pill. He is probably not in his right mind at the moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, is that so. You did well. By the way, why did you take off your clothes? Even though your value decreases if you take them off.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Since he was not in the right mind to begin with, I didn&#8217;t think it would matter.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Whatever, just put them back on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes…&#8221;</p>



<p>Passing me a casual sidelong glance, Kusora Yurea held her head lightly and exited the room. Possibly telling me to be careful. And that&#8217;s where I continued to look disoriented, as if having ingested the medicine.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.10</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;Ara, Hasegawa-san. Welcome to the world of pleasure. Would you like to head outside and enjoy yourself with a woman that suits your tastes?&#8221;</p>



<p>I appropriately nodded to her words. Afterwards, as I was about to leave the room, I tried pouncing at her as if I was actually intoxicated by the drug. And then, as if I lost all my strength, dove onto the bed, making sure she clearly saw me faint in place.</p>



<p>&#8220;What, again? Either ways, there are plenty of such weak ones. Guess I&#8217;ll deal with it next time.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just as Kusora Yurea said, Akamine trotted out of the room, speaking as if this was all just a bother. After who knows how much time later, I persevered in staying fainted through the whole ordeal and once I rose my body and warily made my way out, a yakuza-looking man in a black suit showed up and opened his mouth. I wonder if the meeting was over, since there wasn&#8217;t really any noise coming here.</p>



<p>&#8220;You may take your leave. We will be contacting you through a phone call for the next meeting, so please look forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>Briefly nodding to his words, I exited the building.<br>Just what the heck was that.</p>



<p>Last time, exposing Sakurai&#8217;s secret was the capture condition.<br>If so, then this time would be Akamine&#8217;s secret?<br>Meaning, I&#8217;d have to reveal the truth related to this narcotic to the public?<br>Either that, or I am to sabotage their whole assembly.</p>



<p>When I checked the system panel, there weren&#8217;t any particular changes.<br>At the very least, it&#8217;s certain that the capture condition isn&#8217;t that I shouldn&#8217;t be investigating the essence of the social parties.<br>Comparing the difficulties, there&#8217;s no way it&#8217;d be that easy.</p>



<p>Rather, let&#8217;s just say I took on a mission that was too difficult.<br>She, who could utilize Kusora Yurea however she pleased.<br>Furthermore, it was also true that I was boiling at the fact that she was one who would drug me.</p>

<p>Either way, being unable to turn back once you&#8217;ve set foot onto a mission was this game&#8217;s rule.<br>In that case, it&#8217;s something I have no other choice but to show it.<br>And for that, I need evidence.<br>Since the yakuza are also tied to this, brash actions are taboo.<br>Although, it&#8217;s alright if I acquire certain evidence with the help of the items&#8217; powers.</p>



<p>For the time being, there was nothing else to do but to request Kusora Yurea for any kind of information she had. It was only a matter of time before the appointment at 7 AM would arrive. I got on the first departure of the bus and headed towards the stop where I first met her.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>Confirming the time once I arrived, it was 7 AM. Seating myself onto the bus-stop bench, I calmed myself down in body and mind. As I was in the middle of that, I heard a voice calling out to me from my rear.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oji-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her makeup was left just as it was last time, while her clothes were the only thing that was changed; to the parka she wore yesterday. As I turned back to look at her, she came to my side and sat down.</p><



<p>&#8220;Although I did try coming, I&#8217;m not really informed much about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s fine. At least compared to me, who doesn&#8217;t know a single thing, you&#8217;re probably aware of various things?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, could I be honest with you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If so, then there&#8217;s no helping it… As expected, you&#8217;re that woman&#8217;s ally? Unlike last time.&#8221;</p>



<p>No matter how much I tried to act serious, she continued to stare fixedly at me and move her mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just as I thought, you&#8217;re strange, Oji-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;How many times am I going to hear that?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It can&#8217;t be helped since you really are weird. Fufu.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah yeah, I get that I&#8217;m weird, so can we go somewhere else and talk about this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah yes, I&#8217;m sorry. I don&#8217;t really have that much time. I have something to take care of later, so let&#8217;s speak here.&#8221;</p>




<p>That&#8217;s what she said, taking a look at her watch. Since it couldn&#8217;t be helped, I started to inquire about anything that caught my attention. Firstly, the medicine.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is that medicine exactly? You said it was some kind of narcotics, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Even I don&#8217;t know the exact details. It should be fine if you take it once, but after a few more times, it&#8217;ll turn to a point where you won&#8217;t be able to spend the night peacefully without it, or something? At a glance, it seems like a narcotic that aggravates the male hormones, but even if you do a blood test, it won&#8217;t seem like any was taken.&#8221;</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve heard about the gist of it a while back too, but it really was a worthless drug. I&#8217;m fortunate that I didn&#8217;t get to take it. Although she said I&#8217;d be fine after a single ingestion, it still bothers me. Bastards.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, what about that woman&#8217;s true identity?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She gathers members in a way that doesn&#8217;t make it seem profitable at first and makes them take the medicine, thus completely extorting them dry, then slowly turns people with some degree of social statuses into addicts and makes them obedient. One might even say it&#8217;s laughable how she curries favour with powerful politicians through services and solicitation, making them provide hefty commissions and what not. On top of having notorious yakuza backing her up, thanks to all the political and personal connections she&#8217;s getting through the medicine, she&#8217;s pretty much able to do whatever she wants.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. You mentioned they can&#8217;t be fought against, right? Can nobody slip past their radars?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, after all, it&#8217;s a fact that I was partaking in prostitution. Having grasped onto that weakness, I was pretty much forced into participating in her business. And it&#8217;s not just me, but plenty of other women who had their weaknesses taken advantage of like so.&#8221;</p>



<p>So even after having your weakness exploited, she decided to help me out? Suddenly, my gratitude towards her doubled. Alongside crushing Akamine underneath my feet, I also wanted to set her free through this capture.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so. Perhaps, would you happen to know anything about the other women?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nothing… I&#8217;ve said this before, since I&#8217;m nothing but a mere &#8216;companion&#8217;, I can&#8217;t say anything further than this, nor do I want to…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see…&#8221;</p>



<p>After taking another look at her watch, as if it was no longer possible for her to stay anymore, she stood up from her seat and bowed at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;ll have to excuse myself.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it. Ah, right. Could you give me your phone number? You know, so I could contact you in case I need anything more.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although this was a game world, I unlocked the achievement of asking for a girl&#8217;s number for the first time. My heart thumped, thinking about her potential refusal. My objective was of course not for the sake of getting acquainted with her further, but even so, it was a fresh new feeling. However, she seemed to be troubled with her brows knitted like that. Sigh. She pretended to act kind and said she wouldn&#8217;t be able to give it to me.</p>



<p>&#8220;I… actually don&#8217;t have a cellphone…&#8221;</p>



<p>I unintentionally cracked up. She doesn&#8217;t have a cellphone? That was way too much of a lousy excuse.</p>



<p>&#8220;Would it be alright to give you my residential contact number instead?&#8221;</p>



<p>But then, a sudden plot twist occurred. She took out a memopad from her bag and started to scribble in a bunch of numbers, tearing it off and handing it to be after she was done. So she wasn&#8217;t actually refusing? She really didn&#8217;t carry a cellphone? Seeing her giving away her residential number without any hesitation made me flustered. I involuntarily received the page, after which she bowed and bid me farewell, leaving the place as if she was actually in a hurry.</p>



<p>&#8220;I shall take my leave.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Got it, take care. Is it alright to call here if anything happens?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I asked, pointing at the memo, she nodded in reply. And thus, she left the bus stop. When I looked at the memo, the name Kusora Yurea followed by a contact number written in incredibly pretty handwriting entered my eyes. I was still considerably happy even though I got this instead of her personal phone number. I was so engrossed in my own sea of emotions that I didn&#8217;t even register the people walking around me. And then, she, who had taken her leave, returned once again in bated breath. Did she need to come back for something on the way?</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? Did you forget something?&#8221;</p>



<p>Catching her breath, she replied to my inquiry.</p>



<p>&#8220;I remembered something on the way. Recently, her opinions have been clashing with the yakuza boss. They&#8217;re fighting quite often these days.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;For real? Thanks!! That&#8217;s really useful information!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And… Please don&#8217;t do anything dangerous. They&#8217;re legitimately terrifying people. In any way, that&#8217;s all. I&#8217;ll be taking my leave now.&#8221;</p>



<p>Leaving behind those words, she ran back in a hurry for real this time. So she ran back to the point of being out of breath just to tell me that bit of information? I keep receiving her kindness the more I get to know her. The more I unveil her, the more she seems to be the exact opposite of Akamine.</p>



<p>They were in discord. I&#8217;ll use that to my advantage and sabotage them in the process. If only they&#8217;d show a gap somewhere, it would be easy to defeat them. I might be able to get my hands on some kind of evidence that they leak to the cops thanks to their conflict. It&#8217;ll be a whole nother can of worms if it involves politicians though.</p>



<p>At any rate, the capture condition this time must be to crush these social parties. Nothing else comes to mind. I&#8217;m indeed a little scared since she&#8217;s got the yakuza backing her up, but I&#8217;m not in a situation where I can suddenly back off, so… If I did, I&#8217;d die.</p>



<p>Last time, it was a case of homicide. This time, it was the eradication of underground parties.<br>Quite the righteous game, I see.</p>



<p>For the time being, I returned home. Despite having slept a little while being collapsed at the party, I felt worn out. And just as I fell onto the bed, before I even realised it, the morning sunlight rained down on my eyes.</p>



<p>Although I slept till morning, to think that morning had already arrived. Startled, when I checked the time, it was 9 AM. Did I really sleep just this much? Checking the date, I saw that a day had passed.<br>Hahaha. I should have set an alarm before falling asleep. Looks like I overslept.</p>



<p>Anyways, my mission right now is to make Akamine&#8217;s parties crumble. Recalling the information Kusora Yurea gave me the day prior, it seems I have plenty of room for flexibility. My arsenal consists of the items, &#8216;Save&#8217; and &#8216;Load&#8217;. I&#8217;ll have to utilize my loadout to their maximum potential.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.11</strong></p>

<p>It was because of this that I had taken out all the business cards from Akamine&#8217;s purse. I searched for the ones that belonged to famous people I had seen on TV. Most of the cards that I checked were of entrepreneurs. And among them, a card that only had a name and contact number slapped onto it caught my attention. That was a name I was well used to coming across.</p>



<p>If someone ever met the person I&#8217;m thinking about right now, it would become a big deal on the internet.</p>



<p>Ahah! This was exactly the kind of person I was looking for! Oh, but I of course had no intention of contacting this politician. I only intended to make use of his face. Okay, so this is the plan. I have the &#8216;Morph Potion&#8217;. I&#8217;m going to transform into him and recommend myself to Akamine. If I do that, then I&#8217;ll receive different treatment. After all, I was already under the pretence that I had experience in dealing with drug trafficking.</p>



<p>According to Kusora Yurea&#8217;s information, the relationship between her and the yakuza behind her back was getting complicated. If so, then I have plenty of chances to make this work. If I turn into such a backer, then I bet they&#8217;d come after me. This guy is a renowned politician after all.</p>



<p>Although I brought along Akamine&#8217;s cards, her contact number remains in my call history. If I call this number again, then this Kimoto person will be receiving it as if she were the owner of the number, but I guess it should be fine if I let her convey it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, hello?&#8221;</p>



<p>After a few moments of ringing, I heard the voice of a woman from the other end.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is Hasegawa speaking. I became a member just yesterday. Is it possible to… meet that same person from yesterday again?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was just about to mention &#8216;Akamine&#8217; but immediately panicked and shut myself up that same moment. She never actually let me know her name. It&#8217;s obvious she&#8217;d think it&#8217;s suspicious that I&#8217;d know it without her even uttering it. That&#8217;s why I corrected myself with &#8216;the same person&#8217;.</p>

<p>&#8220;What would be your business?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s… the pill…&#8221;</p>



<p>Her voice grew cold after she heard my name, but as soon as I mentioned the pill, her tone turned cheerful.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so? Then please come by the same cafe that you were interviewed in at 11 AM.&#8221;</p>



<p>After saying that, the call was cut. Just what&#8217;s up with her conceited attitude despite being some call receptionist. Is it that since the superior is cheeky that even the subordinates are the same?</p>


<p>Of course this pisses me off. But I don&#8217;t have enough time. I&#8217;ll suppress my anger for the time being and head out.<br>Putting the same suit from before back on, I left. Since I still had some time extra, I decided to walk till downtown. My head muddled with numerous complicated issues, as I tried to sort myself while walking, I arrived downtown before I realized it.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>So it takes about 40 minutes, huh?</p>



<p>And thus, I got on the subway and headed for the cafe.</p>



<p>In order to carry out the plan properly, I checked out my &#8216;Owned Items&#8217; before I reached my destination.</p>



<p>«Owned Items»<br>‹LV 2 Scouter›<br>‹Master Key›<br>‹Sleep Spray›<br>‹Morph Potion›<br>‹Telescope›</p>



<p>The &#8216;Morph Potion&#8217; was what I intended to use. Firstly, I clicked &#8216;Save&#8217;. Just in case I fail, this should be a good point to do over from.</p>



<p>Doing so, I used the &#8216;Morph Potion&#8217;.</p>



<p>«Would you like to use Morph Potion?»</p>



<p>Clicking the message, a different window popped up above it.</p>



<p>«Please draw a clear image of the person you would like to transform into in your head.»</p>




<p>So it goes like this, huh. I recalled the face of the politician from the card I chose. I drew the image of his cunning face that carried his fake gentleness I saw from back in the elections in my head. And so, yet another different window appeared.</p>



<p>«Please think of the person you would like the masquerade to work on.»</p>



<p>Of course it&#8217;ll be Akamine. I thought of the pure and innocent face that she had. That repulsive woman whose face was the only thing pure about her. Her face distinctly floated into my head.</p>



<p>«Transformation complete.»</p>



<p>Followed by that message appearing, when I tried looking at myself through the reflection on the glass window, I saw the same ol&#8217; me having no particular change in appearance. If all is according to what the item details had said, then only Akamine should be able to see the appearance of said politician.</p>



<p>I have no room to doubt the item&#8217;s abilities. That&#8217;s why boldly strode up the stairs. As I continued to walk in a haughty demeanour, there in the cafe, was nobody else but the same person from the day prior.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi.&#8221;</p>



<p>I walked towards Akamine, sitting there with her natural demeanour of looking down on others, and crisply patted on her shoulder. Responding to the sudden call, she looked up at me. And of course, her clearly surprised expression lay bare before me. After all, projected into her eyes should be the famous politician that was the ringleader from the card in her purse.</p>



<p>She didn&#8217;t even consider getting her ass off the chair back when I showed up, but now, seeing me like this, she gracefully rose up from her seat and bowed down her head. She had immediately submitted herself to a state of powerlessness.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-Why would Sensei be here?&#8221;</p>



<p>Heh, seeing that even her manner of speech had regressed down to stammering, it made me find it quite comical. Carrying an expression that portrayed I had several issues, I haughtily sat myself down on the seat.</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyways, you sit down too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Concealing her expressions, she pulled back the chair and calmly sat down without making a single sound. First time I got to see her acting so courteous. The difference between her treatment from back then was as far as heaven and earth. She&#8217;s just a typical snake, a snake!</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re aware that I&#8217;m an incredibly busy person, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. That is why I&#8217;m always awaiting the day of your meeting. Have I perhaps… made a mistake?&#8221;</p>


<p>I see now. Looks like choosing this guy was indeed the best choice. Even if we part ways now, it seems that she won&#8217;t be contacting this Ariga person himself for confirmations for quite a while. Incidentally, politicians should be having some kind of cost for introducing others for personal connections. But now, it looks like the person I transformed into was so high up that the question of it arising itself became invalid, huh.</p>



<p>Ah well, that&#8217;s for the best. Because I won&#8217;t get caught anyway, I suppose.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;ll get straight to the point.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, Sensei.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You know about the person named Hasegawa, correct?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>She made an obviously surprised face, but after blinking a few times, she quickly returned back to her poker face. Looks like her surprise was beyond control.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was actually me who recommended him. Since we had our hands in the same line of trade, I intended to have some synergy take effect. And despite this, it seems you even made him take the pills?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I-I sincerely apologize! I never even dreamed that Sensei was his referrer…&#8221;</p>



<p>Shocked beyond belief, she immediately bowed her head down, bending her torso over onto the table.</p>

<p>&#8220;There would be too many eyes directed at me if I took action directly. That&#8217;s why, although I dispatched him towards you…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I sincerely apologize! I&#8217;ll make sure I never make such a mistake ever again. I will also make sure to provide my utmost assistance to the person himself.&#8221;</p>



<p>Seeing Akamine in her current state with her head hung low, not even daring to look back up was an exhilarating feeling so my revenge against her has been successful, but I wasn&#8217;t really this powerful politician myself, so there wasn&#8217;t any point.</p>



<p>&#8220;Incidentally, what would you be referring to when you mentioned &#8216;same trade&#8217;&#8230;&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oi, since when have you learnt to talk back at me?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I sincerely apologize. Forgive me for being unable to realize my position.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, judging from the type of business you do, it&#8217;s related to drugs.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is… Is that so… I get the feeling he did mention something similar, but… if he had at least mentioned his relation to Sensei, then…&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing her words, I purposely twitched my eyebrows and said with an angry expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s obviously not something he can disclose so openly!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Please forgive me once again. I sincerely apologize!&#8221;</p>



<p>Akamine slammed her head on the table once again, making a grunting noise as she forced her mouth shut. Guess this much should be fine. If I stay here and keep talking, I might make a blunder and end up revealing myself. If she asked me about anything I wasn&#8217;t aware of, it&#8217;d be quite troublesome.</p>



<p>&#8220;Stay well, then. I&#8217;ll be taking my leave here. Hasegawa should be coming here any time soon, so you two should talk it out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, of course. Please rest assured. I&#8217;ll make sure to not treat him with any kind of disrespect.&#8221;</p>



<p>After hearing her say so, I stood up and headed towards the exit, followed by Akamine who seemed to be intending to send me off. Ah damn, now that&#8217;s gonna be a problem.</p>



<p>&#8220;There are eyes everywhere, so this much is fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, yes. P-Please take care, Sensei!&#8221;</p>



<p>As I looked back at her after my exit, she faithfully followed my— no, the politician&#8217;s orders and returned to her original seat. With this, I guess it can be considered a success. Then, quickly slipping away from the cafe, I called upon my &#8216;Owned Items&#8217;, after which, clicking on the &#8216;Morph Potion&#8217; resulted in a window appearing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Would you like to release Morph Spray? If you release it now then you won&#8217;t be able to use it again.&#8221;</p>



<p>Without a shred of hesitation, I clicked on it, making another window appear.</p>



<p>&#8220;Morph Spray has been released.&#8221;</p>



<p>I reflexively clenched my fist, yelling &#8216;Fight!&#8217; and made my way back up the cafe once again. The part-timers at the cafe seeing me appear again gave me weird looks. Well it&#8217;s a given since the Morph Spray only affects a single individual. In the eyes of the part-timers it looked like the same person had come again.</p>



<p>I ignored those guys and simply carried myself over to where Akamine was.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.12</strong></p>


<p>&#8220;Good day.&#8221;</p>



<p>As I said so, Akamine looked up at me, gave a sweet smile and rose from her seat. This scene. If I was given that smile right from the beginning then I&#8217;d fall for her on the spot, but what I actually got was her receiving me in a manner that made it feel like she was making an investigation instead. Now that I know this was because of the politician appearing, as if I&#8217;d fall for her flattery at this point!</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah yes, Hasegawa-san! If you were related to that person, then you should&#8217;ve said something. I&#8217;ve been incredibly rude yesterday, so please excuse me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, it&#8217;s fine. It wasn&#8217;t a big deal, so I&#8217;ll let it slide.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry. Moving on, I&#8217;ve heard that you&#8217;re also involved in trade business akin to my own.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. I think I&#8217;ve mentioned this before, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing my words, she rubbed her hands together and made an apologetic expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry… Please don&#8217;t take it to heart, alright? Please appease your temper.&#8221;</p>



<p>And she made herself appear as pleasing as possible. Damn, that&#8217;s some terrifying charming ability. Even someone like me, who&#8217;s aware of everything, feels as though my chest is gonna burst, so how would other men respond? But of course, I held back my feelings and continued on with the plan.</p>


<p>&#8220;I understand. More importantly, why not consider working alongside our operations? This also aligns with that person&#8217;s will.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve also heard about that, but… What would we be handling primarily?&#8221;</p>



<p>And thus starts the technical stuff. What product would we be handling? The hell if I know. I&#8217;m bewildered. At times like this, ambiguous answers are the way to go.</p>



<p>&#8220;In general, pretty much everything. The drug you made me take yesterday is also one of the drugs I handle.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Akamine asked me to repeat myself as she frowned at my words, but her countenance took a huge turn. Did I say something suspicious? Well, now that I think about it, I guess it is kind of strange that I took the drug even though I knew full well about it from my operations.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, but of course I was aware of the type of drug and secretly spat it out. I can&#8217;t have myself spilling Sensei&#8217;s name so I could slip away without issues.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing my excuse, she smiled. Could this much be considered an adequate excuse?</p>



<p>&#8220;Then why not make a deal with me? But before that, I&#8217;d like to have a more detailed discussion, so would you mind us changing our location? At my building. Having a discussion both verbally… and physically. Well? Fufu.&#8221;</p>



<p>As expected, taking the politician&#8217;s support sped everything up. If I feed the yakuza relevant information and cause a misunderstanding after going along with her and completing the deal, they should start taking each other out. Since they were already in discord, this was a timely opportunity.</p>



<p>I don&#8217;t see anyone coming after me after it was disclosed to her that I have the backing of a big-shot. And as such, if I manage to acquire all the evidence I need amidst crossfire and disclose it into the news, the social parties should collapse. Fuhaha! A perfect plan, I must say.</p>



<p>Rather than defending her, if the secrets regarding the drug are exposed, the politicians I saw from her bag should all cut ties with her instead. Indeed, she&#8217;d be the scapegoat for my actions! Even if problems arise, the politicians that continued to trouble themselves would no longer be there. If so, then my revenge will be accomplished. And consequently, the capture of Akamine too.</p>



<p>All the trust I have was thanks to the powers of the politician I transformed into.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s do that, then.&#8221;</p>



<p>I stood up from my seat. As I paid the bill, she left her seat to head to the washroom. And after a short while, the two of us made our way towards the building from yesterday. Her car was a high class imported one manufactured by B.<br>Once we arrived in the underground parking lot of said building, Akamine went ahead and got off before me. I followed suit.</p>



<p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Faintly humming and singing, Akamine continued to walk through the parking lot. Well, she&#8217;s in a good mood. Is it because of me? Amusing girl. Keep enjoying this while you can. Your end is nigh.</p>



<p>As the two of us walked side by side, we reached the elevator. And at that moment, Akamine turned around and spoke.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, Hasegawa-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>Before I noticed, her expression had changed. Even ceasing to hum, her eyes sharpened, completely unlike her overall innocent appearance.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is anything the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hasegawa-san is familiar with handling my medicine, correct?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Yes, it&#8217;s similar…&#8221;</p>



<p>Answered her as though it was a matter of fact.</p>



<p>&#8220;You see, that drug is something I personally concocted myself, so there&#8217;s no way you would be familiar with handling them.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes? T-That drug?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was astonished. Suddenly, the expression that portrayed I was saying something ridiculous from back when I first mentioned this &#8216;fact&#8217; about the drug had resurfaced.</p>


<p>However, why did she keep quiet about it and only mention this now?<br>Something&#8217;s definitely wrong here.</p>



<p>— Vroooom</p>



<p>At that instant, a car came charging towards me at breakneck speed. No, by the time I processed it, I had already been run over by the car.</p>



<p>— Crack crack crack!!!</p>



<p>The sound of bones breaking.<br>And at the same time, I tumble across the ground, having been launched away by the car. And so, the car stopped. I was able to discern someone getting off of it. As I confirmed it amidst my blurring vision, Akamine&#8217;s figure came into view. Beside her, stood a man in a suit. And then, she approached me, crouched down, and raised my head by the chin.</p>



<img src="https://i0.wp.com/hinjakuhonyaku.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/03/Ore.no_.Genjitsu.wa_.Renai_.Game_...full_.2735158-1.jpg?resize=722%2C1024&#038;ssl=1"></img>


<p>&#8220;Hasegawa-san… you&#8217;re a hundred years too early to be probing at our underground business.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, she dusted her hand off and stood back up. I couldn&#8217;t see much since my vision was blurry, but I managed to hear the voices of her having a conversation with that man.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just what&#8217;s up with that Sensei?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I feel something suspicious going on. Recommending someone like this, does he plan on betraying? Even though so much money was put upon him, fuck, politicians are so…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Shigemichi-san, what shall we do about &#8216;him&#8217;?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Just bury him in some asphalt or something.&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s some terrifying conversation these two are having!</p>



<p>&#8220;Ara, I&#8217;d really like to see that happen. Fufu.&#8221;</p>



<p>And so, Akamine linked arms with him.</p>



<p>Even as I suffered through such pain and agony, she laughed. No wonder it felt like things were going smoothly. I thought I was being cautious but I had been considerably underestimating her. It was a mistake to talk about the drug without investigating it thoroughly. I tried to move my hand but my arm kept trembling, making it difficult to budge. Even so, using every ounce of the last bit of strength I had in order to hold onto my waning sliver of life, I clicked on the Load window.</p>



<p>«Would you like to load?»</p>



<p>&#8220;The hell is up with this guy?&#8221;</p>



<p>Right then, my hand was trampled on, making that side of me unusable. Seeing me in that state, Akamine scornfully laughed at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Doesn&#8217;t it fill you with rapture when you see him struggle for his life? Let us leave the cleanup over here to your subordinates and leave. If I see a person die before me like this, I&#8217;d get too excited again.&#8221;</p>



<p>A voice of coquetry.<br>Her face filled with enrapture, Akamine involuntarily swung her waist. Hearing those words, I somehow managed to come back to my senses a little. The seething rage forced me to continue&nbsp; breathing and hold onto my consciousness. Luck still on my side, the Load window hadn&#8217;t disappeared yet. I tried to move my other hand, but couldn&#8217;t muster the strength. As it shook and trembled with the incoherent control over my muscles, every so slowly, I somehow managed to graze the window with the slightest tip of my finger. And thus, my vision was filled with whiteness once again.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.13</strong></p>

<p>The point at which I loaded back to was just before I used the &#8216;Morph Potion&#8217;.</p>



<p>&#8220;Haah…&#8221;</p>



<p>The agonizing pain still remained coursing through my brain.<br>Thankfully &#8216;Load&#8217; completely nullified all damage done to the body.<br>If I tried to load back with my blood draining as all my internal organs were crushed, I&#8217;d end up dying in the end.</p>



<p>Heaving a sigh of relief, I shook my head to recollect myself.<br>She&#8217;s most likely in the cafe by now.</p>



<p>I was currently in this screwed up situation all because of choosing the wrong words to speak.<br>When I checked the &#8216;Game System&#8217; the &#8216;Morph Potion&#8217; was gone.<br>Looks like it won&#8217;t revert items back to its previous state after loading back once it has been used up.</p>



<p>So it intends to make me repurchase it, huh?</p>



<p>But it doesn&#8217;t seem like Akamine was pretending to be aware of the potion.</p>



<p>Akamine and that yakuza man.<br>It was obvious that the two of them were quite intimate.<br>It didn&#8217;t seem like they were experiencing discord.<br>Or perhaps there were other yakuza besides that man a while ago?</p>



<p>Whatever it is, looks like it&#8217;ll be irrational to use the &#8216;Morph Potion&#8217; again with this much information.<br>For the time being, I ditched my appointment and returned home. As for the appointment, I can use the &#8216;Morph Potion&#8217; again and patch everything up by turning into that politician.</p>



<p>The reason for why I returned home was to reorganize myself and all the information a bit more before utilizing the &#8216;Morph Spray&#8217; again. Since they&#8217;re people who&#8217;re capable of saying stuff like burying people in asphalt, leisurely getting closer to them is bad news. It had already dawned on me. If by chance I died instantly without being able to load back, then everything would&#8217;ve been over.</p>



<p>The feeling of floating around between life and death resurfaced.<br>Just how on earth should I make my counterattack?<br>The only weapon I have is nothing but the &#8216;Sleep Spray&#8217;.<br>Just what kind of card would serve as a more decisive move?</p>



<p>Thinking of digging up more information I opened Akamine&#8217;s purse once again and started to line up all the business cards onto my bed. Everything, from her driver&#8217;s license to the cards inserted alongside it. It was the first time I had completely emptied out her purse.</p>



<p>I fished around the business cards just in case there was someone even higher up the ladder, but it seemed that the politician prior was topmost one. I couldn&#8217;t find any other name beyond his.</p>



<p>I guess it could be said that getting involved by transforming into someone from the parliament wouldn&#8217;t be a good idea since she was intimate with the yakuza.<br>Looking after me, huh?</p>



<p>Highly doubtful. It wasn&#8217;t a definitive card.<br>In the first place, this whole plan of turning into the politician was based on the premise that she wasn&#8217;t on good terms with the yakuza.</p>



<p>I tried thinking of it in the likes of their intimacy being a mere outward appearance, but in the end I didn&#8217;t have sufficient information to back that up. Throwing away the card, I picked up Akamine&#8217;s driver&#8217;s licence.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>As expected, she looked pure and innocent in the photo.<br>To think that she&#8217;d spout stuff like getting excited over killing someone with this kind of appearance.<br>No other way to describe her but a real shitty woman. A complete waste of such an innocent appearance.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh?&#8221;</p>



<p>As I looked at the photo in her driver&#8217;s licence, an incredibly unpleasant memory resurfaced.<br>Something seriously uncomfortable.</p>



<p>Her full name was different.</p>



<p>Full Name: Kimoto Ririsa<br>Address: Tottori Prefecture, Tottori City, East Town XXX</p>



<p>The face is the same.<br>There&#8217;s no doubt that it&#8217;s her face.<br>Since it was put together with her business card, I didn&#8217;t particularly bother about the name portion on her license till now. But now, this name was different from what I knew. Kimoto? Isn&#8217;t she Akamine? Suddenly, a terrifying thought dawned on me as cold sweat ran down my spine. I was overwhelmed, that somehow… I might&#8217;ve ended up associating with someone I shouldn&#8217;t have associated with.</p>



<p>Thinking that I had to confirm it, I took out my phone. I fiddled around in my pocket and took out the paper given to me by Kusora Yurea. Dialing her written down residential number, I immediately clicked the call button.</p>



<p><em>Tiriririri</em></p>


<p>Come on, pick up. Please.<br>As I raised my voice, I continued to pray that the call was received. However, it continued to ring, without anyone answering.</p>



<p><em>Tiriririri</em></p>



<p>The continuous ringing made me terribly impatient. It can&#8217;t be that she gave me some other number that didn&#8217;t even exist, right? Just as I was about to throw my phone at the wall in rage, I was finally graced with a voice from the other end.</p>



<p>I placed the phone near my ear once again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello.&#8221;</p>



<p>The voice I heard was somewhat hoarse. I had to confirm whether it was really her or not.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um… Kusora-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>That&#8217;s what I asked to confirm my guesses when I heard the hoarse voice from the other end again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oji-san?&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;Yeah, it&#8217;s me.&#8221;</p>



<p>The manner of addressing that would always piss me off suddenly became my only respite in this situation. She&#8217;s the one who told me not to get involved with Akamine too much. Of course she&#8217;d give me false information.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is something the matter? You don&#8217;t really sound spirited at the moment.&#8221;</p>



<p>I felt like tears were about to come out seeing that she&#8217;s even able to sense what I&#8217;m going through at the moment. That&#8217;s just how big of a mental blow I was given by Akamine.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, I&#8217;m fine. I wanted to ask about something.&#8221;</p>


<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That woman, the organizer of the social parties. The woman you told me to be careful about.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, what about the Madam?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you perhaps know what her name is?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I do. Please wait a second. If I recall correctly, um…… perhaps…… it might&#8217;ve been…… Kimoto-san, I suppose?&#8221;</p>



<p>The name Kusora Yurea knew was also Kimoto. And so another can of worms exploded at my face.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. Thank you. I&#8217;m kind of in a hurry, so I&#8217;ll talk to you again some time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O-Oji-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>At the end of that sentence, I cut the call. Right now, I needed to deal with Akamine, first and foremost. In any case, she introduces herself to others as Kimoto. I recall clearly that the person who received the call at the very beginning had also introduced herself as Kimoto Ririsa. I did think she had a cheeky attitude lacking in manner, but to think that she was the person herself.</p>



<p>If so, then it would mean that Akamine herself receives the subscribed telephone as well. I guess above the whole special interview thing, getting new members was a really momentous task so of course she wouldn&#8217;t leave it in the hands of a subordinate. It was only a matter of fact that the person herself would come. And the person who also came to the appointed location was also her.</p>



<p>Then what the hell is all this. It was obvious that the scouter spelled out the name Akamine Miyuki. There&#8217;s no way I saw incorrectly. I tried to brush through my memories… about what the name I saw on her high school diary was. But there was little to no mention of her own name in it. After all, it&#8217;s something one would only use personally.</p>



<p>However, the items are absolute. They&#8217;re products that dominate over this world that&#8217;s exactly like reality like a god. Hence there&#8217;s no way it would make a mistake on the name like this. Therefore, her real name was not actually Kimoto Ririsa, but Akamine Miyuki.</p>



<p>Once again, I checked the driver&#8217;s license.<br>Come to think of it, the address isn&#8217;t even in Tokyo. The issued date was also at the age she&#8217;d be allowed to apply for one. I wonder if she was living in the countryside at the time. The same place where she seemed to have been terribly bullied?</p>



<p>Then wouldn&#8217;t I be able to know the truth behind her name if I went there?<br>There should be someone who would know the truth regarding whether her name was actually Kimoto or Akamine. Even more so than finding a special trait of the village.</p>



<p>I rushed out of my house. The information needed to disclose the mystery should be in this address. I devoted my full being into this as I boarded the bullet train. I got on a taxi once I reached the station and requested the driver to go to the address written down on the license. There was no escaping the long time the whole process took.</p>



<p>To think I would come so far on such short notice all of a sudden. The taxi driver was saying something but none of it registered in my head as I gave a half-hearted reply. Time flew by as the taxi driver drove across the country road<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>[1]</sup></a>. Other than that, only a single patch of farmland came into view.</p>



<p>The place where the driver dropped me off was exactly like the kind of rural neighbourhood image I had in my head. I had pretty much reached the place according to what the address showed, but I never thought it would be like this. Just how was a monstrous woman like her born in a quiet and tranquil place like this? Well, she was someone on the receiving end of bullying so I guess she wasn&#8217;t really a monster back then.</p>



<p>For the time being, I decided to walk the rest of the way towards the exact address stated in the license. A house with a small garden, covered in cobwebs. An incredibly deserted house carrying the lonesome ambience of being unused by anybody for a long time.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.14</strong></p>

<p>&#8220;What are you looking for there, sonny? I haven&#8217;t seen you around here before.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>When I turned towards the direction of the voice, I saw an old lady standing there. Wearing rubber boots, it seemed as though she was on her way to return back from working in the fields.</p>



<p>&#8220;There&#8217;s nobody living in that house anymore, so what would your business be?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, excuse me. I actually came here to visit the person named Kimoto Ririsa. I was told she lived here.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ririsa? She has long since passed away though?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What? She passed away?&#8221;</p>



<p>I was surprised to the point of getting a heart attack. If she&#8217;s dead, then who on earth is the one who accompanied me? A goddamn ghost?</p>



<p>&#8220;Aah, and after her death, both her parents also followed her to the afterlife… A very unfortunate bunch.&#8221;</p>




<p>Her parents too? I was so shocked that I was completely unable to suppress myself from shuddering. To think that her entire family just got up and left. Then who the hell is the Kimoto back in Tokyo? I felt like I had been bewitched by some kind of fox. That&#8217;s when it suddenly hit me. Just in case, thinking that it might be possible, I tried asking the lady about the other name. That oh-so accursed name.</p>



<p>&#8220;In that case, do you happen to know anybody named Akemine Miyuki?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Akemine? Don&#8217;t ever utter the likes of that name before me!&#8221;</p>



<p>The old lady showed a clear sign of displeasure. I got the feeling that I was beginning to understand the gist of it. If someone who knew Kimoto also knew about Akemine then it&#8217;s possible that my conjecture was correct.</p>



<p>&#8220;Would it be alright to ask you a few things? I&#8217;m kind of a new reporter, you see, so I&#8217;ve come to investigate some matter regarding this Akemine individual.&#8221;</p>




<p>Of course it was a lie, but after giving me a once-over, she sighed and decided to speak, having nothing to hide in particular.</p>



<p>&#8220;I have no idea why Ririsa&#8217;s name would resurface again after all this time, if I&#8217;m able to be of service for the sake of that woman who&#8217;s still at large, then I&#8217;ll speak. Although both Ririsa and Akemine had lived together in this village ever since they were little, then were pretty divided and behind the eyes of the adults, Akemine would often bully her terribly. Moreover, it got worse once they entered high school, where she joined a group of delinquents and forced Ririsa to give her money. And then soon after, by those guys, Ririsa was… you know.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;She was raped, wasn&#8217;t she?&#8221;</p>



<p>Although I already got the feeling that it was the case, I absolutely had to put it into words for absolute confirmation, to which lady nodded accordingly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, indeed… But even so, Ririsa tried to live an earnest life after that. However, at the end of the day… you know. She just wanted to get over with high school as fast as possible, and in order to rid herself from Akemine, she sought employment far away in Tokyo. I&#8217;ve heard she raked up a good set of qualifications. But Akemine who also got to know about it got together with those guys again and wished to ceaselessly torment her. By making countless men… It terrifies me to even attempt to put into words. We got to know about it much later, since Ririsa never wanted us to see her in that state.&#8221;</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>The woman seemed to know Kimoto quite intimately, but… the shame and grief from it was correspondingly shown on her frown. And a moment later, her recital continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;And then… she jumped into the village reservoirs, thus passing away. Afterwards, from the police inspections, it was said that during the time of her death, there was a child in her belly. It&#8217;s possible that it&#8217;s because of this that she had a mental breakdown.&#8221;</p>



<p>A devastating truth. But the old lady&#8217;s explanation had still yet to end. Seemingly having more to say, she continued on.</p>



<p>&#8220;Either way, it was quite noisy for an hour or so since a person had died, but since there wasn&#8217;t enough evidence, Akemine was released. It&#8217;s absurd, but that&#8217;s just how the world is. As a matter of fact, Akemine lost both her parents at a very young age and so was raised by her grandmother, but… it is also rumored whether she had been the one to kill her as well or not. In any case, following Ririsa&#8217;s death, what happened to her conscience, you ask? She fooled around even more girls and then escaped somewhere far away. But this time there since there were clear evidences, she was charged with murder and said that she won&#8217;t be able to slip away anymore, but strangely, we were never informed whether she was really captured or not. Please, I sincerely beg you to capture her somehow or another.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah… Thank you very much… for letting me know such a thing. I also wish that she&#8217;d be captured as soon as possible.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh dear! It&#8217;s already so late. I need to hurry.&#8221;</p>



<p>Recalling the errands she had to do, the lady briskly took off with those parting words. As I looked back at the deserted house, I could feel the knots open up. That woman had escaped to Tokyo after running away from here.</p>



<p>I had completely misread the situation. It&#8217;s not that her personality had become warped after being bullied but that her personality was fucked up to begin with, tormenting others as a hobby ever since she was a child. That too, to the point of killing others. Exactly like her current self!</p>



<p>If so, then that would mean their faces are alike even though they aren&#8217;t twins?</p>



<p>It&#8217;s possible she remodeled herself with plastic surgery… in order to avoid the police&#8217;s radar. Considering that she has yet to be captured, this was highly likely.</p>



<p>Since the entire family was dead, I wonder if she took advantage of that and took Kimoto Ririsa&#8217;s driver&#8217;s license in order to head over to Tokyo. Since she took all her qualifications, it wasn&#8217;t strange to take the driver&#8217;s license either. She was in need of employment after all.</p>



<p>In either case, it turns out that the scouter had indeed displayed her real name. Just because she got plastic surgery done, doesn&#8217;t mean she&#8217;ll be able to trick it.</p>



<p>Although the death statement was released, since she wouldn&#8217;t handle her business on the surface, she would face no problems in continuing to live on as Kimoto.</p>



<p>&#8220;Shit…&#8221;</p>



<p>For a while, I smiled before the deserted house. As I did so, I was suddenly hit with an idea on how to cook up Akemine. This is where the real counterattack starts. Any more failures are unforgivable.</p>



<p>As I returned to Tokyo, my revenge plot took a change.<br>And of course, the Morph Potion was an integral part of it.<br>However, I had no intention of turning into the politician.</p>



<p>«LV 2 Scouter: 150,000 ¥»<br>«Sleep Spray: 250,000 ¥»<br>«Master Key: 600,000 ¥ »<br>«Camera: 100,000 ¥ »<br>«Sleep Spray: 1,000,000 ¥ »<br>«Telescope: 700,000 ¥ »<br>«Stopwatch: 30,000,000 ¥ »<br>«Imported Car: 50,000,000 ¥ »<br>«Domestic Car: 8,000,000 ¥ »</p>



<p>Before, when I took a look at the items&#8217; descriptions, the Morph Potion didn&#8217;t seem to have any usage limitations. However, it was a single-use item for 100,000 ¥. Meaning, it&#8217;s the same as actually having a limitation. However, I can&#8217;t avoid anything at this point. Without any hesitation, I chose to repurchase it.</p>



<p>«Would you like to purchase the Morph Potion?»</p>



<p>I clicked on the window. And so, just as before, I arrived at Akemine&#8217;s apartment once again. It was already the time of dawn. I used the Master Key at the entrance, got on the elevator and used the Master Key once again on the door to her residence.</p>


<p>I entered her home in secret. Since it was the time of dawn, she must still be sleeping. As I entered the living room, there was nobody around. Carefully, I opened the room to her bedroom, where I saw Akemine lying asleep. Rather, I bet she&#8217;s sleeping after an entire day of killing people since daybreak. Of course, that&#8217;s something from before loading back.</p>



<p>Either way, I closed the door to her bedroom and went to the living room once again. Heading into the room that had the desk, I took Kimoto&#8217;s diary. In order to look at the picture slid inside it. There, Kimoto stood in the photo with a frightened expression.</p>



<p>At first, I thought it was Akemine herself, but rather than her, it was Kimoto who had died. It&#8217;s possible that one of the girls in this picture is what Akemine actually looked like before the plastic surgery.</p>



<p>It&#8217;s not certain, but my conjecture would be that this person placing her hand on Kimoto&#8217;s shoulder with a smile on her face might be her. Her smiling face gave off the same feeling of being forced as she gave me from back in the cafe. If my conjecture is right, then her skeletal structure was indeed similar to Kimoto. If so, the plastic surgery wouldn&#8217;t be that big of a deal to undergo.</p>



<p>The reason for why I had taken the photo out once again was to observe every minute detail of Kimoto&#8217;s facial expression. Of course, as Akemine&#8217;s face floated into my head, it certaily did look like Kimoto&#8217;s, but it wasn&#8217;t as distinct or vivid. It was necessary for me to get as close to her youthful appearance from around the time of her death as possible. It won&#8217;t do if it&#8217;s not exactly the same as her face from that time.</p>



<p>I had already confirmed that this house didn&#8217;t have any other photos. Perhaps, Akemine herself wasn&#8217;t really fond of taking pictures herself. And also, she must&#8217;ve gotten rid of all the other photos from her past. As such, this single remaining piece of photograph had an incredibly important role to play at this moment. I wonder why she never got rid of this particular photo.</p>



<p>Maybe, she took the diary in order to make her impersonation of Kimoto as real as possible, but in that gap, never noticed the existence of this photo. That&#8217;s probably the right way to go about it.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.15</strong></p>

<p>«Would you like to use the Morph Potion?»</p>



<p>Anyway, as I looked at the photo and formed the image of her in my head, I resolved myself to use the &#8216;Morph Potion&#8217; and clicked on the window.</p>



<p>«Please draw a clear image of the person you would like to transform into in your head.»</p>



<p>Since I had the photo right in my hand, there were no issues. I drew the image of the face in the picture in my head, down to even her garments.</p>



<p>«Please think of the person you would like the masquerade to work on.»</p>



<p>That&#8217;s easy. After all, the target and the subject both have the same face.</p>



<p>«Transformation complete.»</p>



<p>Clicking the final window, I slid the photo back in its place in the diary and retreated back. As I was about to exit the room, countless cardboard boxes entered my vision. I didn&#8217;t bother opening them last time, thinking it wasn&#8217;t important, but now my curiosity was piqued anew.</p>



<p>I wonder what she&#8217;s keeping stored here. Her being someone involved in countless crimes till now, considering that makes me think there must be something or another inside these. Since the Morph Potion didn&#8217;t even have a time limit, I thought why not, so I tried checking out the topmost box nearby. But there was nothing strange in particular. There were several books crammed in. Moving on, I opened another one. There was a bunch of junk organized in it. Was it all seriously simply her belongings?</p>



<p>But even then, I somehow mustered up my willpower and continued to check on one box after another once I moved away the topmost one. I don&#8217;t know whether my patience was high or not, but once I reached the middle box, I discovered a safe. The size of the boxes piled up behind the desk were just as big as the ones used for changed residences. The safe was a fourth of that size. I thought of opening it was sealed shut. No matter how I saw it, it felt like it held some pretty important stuff. When I tried shaking it, the sound of gold… did not greet my ears.</p>



<p>Since the &#8216;Morph Spray&#8217; is currently in use, I can&#8217;t use the &#8216;Master Key&#8217;. Thinking that I&#8217;d take it back later, I kept it atop the desk. Then I thought of directly going back to the bedroom, but I suddenly had a different idea. No matter how bold of a woman she was, if the girl she killed came back to haunt her as a ghost, there&#8217;s no way she shouldn&#8217;t be afraid. Even if she was an emotionless psychopath, it was a situation where she couldn&#8217;t help but be surprised. And now, what if the ghost also wanted to come kill you? Of course, it would be even more effective.</p>



<p>I headed to the kitchen and searched for a murder weapon. And very quickly, I discover a variety of kitchen knives amongst her cutlery. I grabbed the largest in the collection. And of course, it goes to say that I didn&#8217;t really have any intention to kill her. There&#8217;s a chance that murder would trigger legal action, so I only intended to scare her.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>There&#8217;s no way a person who wouldn&#8217;t shudder in fright after seeing a ghost standing beside their bed with a large knife in their hands as soon as they open their eyes exists.</p>



<p>Opening the door to her bedroom, I quietly entered. I gave her, who was sleeping in her underwear, cheek a tight slap to wake her up. And immediately after, I deftly made my way near her bed, making the most ominous face could as I held the kitchen knife and stood steady.</p>


<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>Having her cheek slapped, her eyes slightly opened. Her face probably stings. I kind of unintentionally ended up mustering all my strength in that after all. As expected, Akemine rubbed her cheek and sat up from her bed with a dubious expression. She rubbed her eyes as she struggled to open them.</p>



<p>&#8220;A~ke~mi~ne~&#8221;</p>



<p>I slowly called out her real name in order to make her face my way. And accordingly, her face immediately shot towards me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Who is it!&#8221;</p>



<p>She got startled and shot up from her bed. However, she still seemed to have trouble comprehending that someone was standing right here. I wonder if she can&#8217;t discern my face since the lights aren&#8217;t on.</p>



<p>&#8220;A~ke~mi~ne~&#8221;</p>



<p>Calling out to her once again, I quickly moved the curtains away, letting the moonlight rain down on me. Now she should be able to recognize Kimoto&#8217;s face before her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Y-Y-You should&#8217;ve been dead!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A~ke~mi~ne~I~will~kill~you~&#8221;</p>


<p>Purposely stretching my words in one continuous pauseless stream, I brandished the knife as an act of threatening her. As the moonlight reflected off its metallic and sharp edge and entered my eyes, even I shuddered from it.</p>



<p>&#8220;S-S-Stop fucking around! G-G-Get away from me…!&#8221;</p>



<p>Repeatedly flailing arms around in front of her, Akemine ran away from her bed. And just as she was about to leave the room, her legs got caught in between, making her fall.</p>



<p>&#8220;A~ke~mi~ne~&#8221;</p>



<p>I kept repeating her name again and again to instill more fear. Finally lifting herself back up, she slowly drew back. Her facial expression was just as contorted as you&#8217;d expect. A completely unbelievable countenance lay bare before me.</p>



<p>&#8220;A dream?&#8221;</p>



<p>Trembling in place, she pinched her own cheek. But all she received was pain. Of course, since this wasn&#8217;t a dream. After experiencing the stinging sensation of pinching her cheeks on her own, she yelled in agony.</p>



<p>&#8220;Get away from me! Just where does a dead bitch like you think you&#8217;re in!&#8221;</p>



<p>Even as she said so, she continued to slowly draw backwards, unceasingly trembling. And then, as I grasped the knife in my hands, without saying a single word, I broke into a sprint towards her.</p>



<p>&#8220;DON&#8217;T COME NEAR MEEEEEEE!&#8221;</p>



<p>And just like that, Akemine turned around and started running. Flying through her entranceway, she dashed out of her house in her underwear. That&#8217;s just how much she was in panic. And of course I pursued her. I intended to scare her to the point of reaching the police. Just her fingerprints alone should be enough for them to reach the conclusion of the female murderer that ran away.</p>



<p>Akemine repeatedly mashed the elevator button. But seeing as to how it was descending from the 21ˢᵗ floor at its own steady pace, she gave up and ran down the stairs. And of course, I continued to run behind her.</p>



<p>&#8220;A~ke~mi~ne~&#8221;<br>Lengthening the syllables, I called out her name single-mindedly. As she descended down, she lost her footing at one point and tumbled down. At the end of it, her body was curled up and quivering.</p>



<p>&#8220;This is a nightmare! This has to be…&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, her panties proceeded to become completely drenched. Spurts of urine continued to leak out of her. The floor she had fallen onto had now been flooded… with her filthy piss. Then, from the top of the stairway, I jumped down. Akemine being utterly terrified at that scene, continued to fall down the stairs as she continued to wet herself. The impacts ultimately made her limp. If I really intended to catch her, I easily could have done with at the speed she was trying to escape me, but I kind of wanted to make her fear me more so I ended up taking my sweet time following her around.</p>



<p>Even with the elevator coming down, Akemine ran towards the parking lot. The figure of her running in her underwear was incredibly gruesome. No matter how someone looked at her, they&#8217;d think she had gone crazy. Not gonna lie, that kinda made me feel refreshed.</p>



<p>Although she&#8217;s the same person who killed me, the terror that lay bare was more than what I anticipated. Soon enough, I also arrived at the parking lot, the trail of urine leading me towards her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t come. I&#8217;m… I&#8217;m not even on drugs… Why… Just why! Why am I able to see a dead person? Why the fuck is this happening!&#8221;</p>



<p>However, a completely unexpected scenario unfolded. In order to run away from me, she only faced forward without paying attention to her surroundings, resulting in a parking car running over her. It was barely dawn so the driver couldn&#8217;t make out what was in front of him either. Since it entered the parking lot without even stopping, it was travelling at a considerable speed. At the same time as the sound of the brakes being stepped on all of a sudden reverberated throughout the area, Akemine was flung ahead. And finally, after a tumbling a few times, she collapsed, sprawling onto the parking lot floor.</p>



<p>Startled, I ran towards her. Ironically enough, her current state was quite the same as mine before I loaded back. You reap what you sow, was what I thought. In the end, evil deeds will be judged accordingly. However, Akemine struggled up in that same state and continued to stagger away again. All for the sake of going as far away as possible from me who had gotten closer to her.&nbsp;</p>



<p>&#8220;Get… Get away from me! Get away — Don&#8217;t come near me! You really think a bitch like you is capable of killing the likes of me…? Geho-gehoh!&#8221;</p>



<p>Spouting and shouting all that at me, she turned back around again and limped forward, resuming her escape from me once again. What immense willpower! The driver had dashed out for her out of concern, but now he pretended to not even have seen her. Even after leaving through the apartment entrance and reaching the sidewalk, she continued on to cross the road. Thinking it was about time I ended this charade and seriously catch her, I picked up my speed and started running. However, that ended up having adverse effects.</p>



<p>As she screamed at the top of lungs on her own and broke into a sprint to cross the road, as if there was some kind of universal compelling force<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> in action, in these early morning hours, a large truck suddenly appeared and came speeding in and crashed into her. Akemine&#8217;s body was blown off straight up into the sky, flying dozens of meters ahead, and finally falling splat onto the ground.</p>



<p>I tried confirming the situation that sprung up. Her body twitched and blood poured out her mouth. And even in that state, she muttered something again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Sa… Save me… I… I don&#8217;t… want to die…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t screw with me. What about the people you&#8217;ve killed?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sh-Shud up… N-No… I was wrong…… That&#8217;s why, please… Save me… Uuuu…&#8221;</p>



<p>Thus saying so, Akemine reached out her arm towards me. However, that arm very quickly lost its strength and languidly dangled. And finally, her body was no longer able to move anymore. Once I tried confirming her breath, she had already died.</p>



<p>Compared to the countless evil deeds she had done, I felt that her end had been all too quick. Moreover, having been run over twice consecutively… that really was quite the compelling force.<a id="s2" href="#n2"><sup>[2]</sup></a></p>



<p>However, what was particularly pitiful was that I strangely didn&#8217;t think she had died for my sake. Not just me, but who knows how many people that stood in her path had been run over by her. And now she herself also faced the same fate. I can&#8217;t call this anything other than retribution. It was exhilarating to chase her around, but all those feelings had suddenly died down. I kind of wanted to personally inflict pain upon her through numerous other evil acts, slowly taking my time in making her regret everything she had done. Man, if she just up and dies so suddenly, then everything is all over, isn&#8217;t it?</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.16</strong></p>


<p>After watching the final moments for a short while with an uninterested look, I stepped away from the scene, shaking my head. I could hear the sound of sirens from a distance. Returning to her abode, I put the knife back in its place. And finally, taking the safe I had kept on the desk, I returned back home. Sure enough, just what kind of things would that crazy woman be hiding in such a safe… money?</p>



<p>A safe that was thoroughly locked up by that Akemine. It has to be something as important as money and the like. Thus, I opened it up using the &#8216;Master Key&#8217;. What lay inside were a bunch of documents and envelopes. Checking out the documents, I found out that there were a list of names of the members of the social parties. And there was also a collection of documents and proof regarding the involvement of the yakuza. I guess this is what one might call a bombshell being dropped. Seems like she was preparing countermeasures just in case her relationship with them really did turn sour at some point.</p>



<p>These are the perfect materials for getting the yakuza that sponsored the social parties arrested. It&#8217;s just… although the documents regarding the party members were exactly what seemed to be — a list of names, the names of powerful people that she had connections with as a means of getting funding were not among them. Of course, including the politician I had transformed into.</p>



<p>Either way, as I thought about how politicians would easily be able to slip away at a moment&#8217;s notice, I took out the documents that were kept inside the envelopes besides ones prior.</p>



<p>There, the information about the drug Akemine herself had concocted was written. Even if it could be something impossible from people higher up, they were documents that she and the yakuza would be able to settle scores with.</p>



<p>If so, then there&#8217;s no helping it if it takes some more time. It was about 8 AM so, utilizing the post office, I sent various copies to the broadcasting stations, police stations, newspaper companies, and also just in case, famous magazine publishers. It was a pain in the ass to send one copy at a time, but since I couldn&#8217;t use my computer, there weren&#8217;t any other methods available.</p>



<p>With this, the bribable politicians should all be forced to hush up and retract back, pinning the blame onto their subordinates for the transgressions. Recalling all the dramas I had watched in the past of similar genre, I returned back home.</p>



<p>Anyhow, there&#8217;s no way for my existence to be leaked. The game always guards me when it comes to actions pertaining to a capture. I have that conviction… that at the very least, that would be the case for actions others than murder, rape and similar such foulplay that would settle things too easily.</p>



<p>Either way, with this, Kusora will no longer have to be bossed around by her.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>With the sudden spark of joy awakening within me, as I was about to close up the safe in order to throw it away, I noticed a single memo pad placed within it. As I took the memo pad, that was placed underneath all the documents thus making it hard for me to notice it at first, out onto my hand, I found something written in someone&#8217;s actual handwriting.</p>



<p>Looks like some kind of organization chart that&#8217;s drawn up on it.</p>



<p>『Advocators of the underworld // Government funds…</p>



<p>Ebihara Masuji / Itorai Shizuka / Sawabe Juushuu</p>



<p>Takashi Kai &#8211; And me』 <a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>[1]</sup></a></p>



<p>The entire thing was written right there for me. That is… the memo that Akemine herself had prepared. And on top, were the names of various different politicians. Names that were not on the membership registry. It even had the name of the one I transformed into on it.</p>



<p>No matter superpower Akemine was, she was unable to gather evidence behind all of these people. As I scanned over it for any possible minute details, I noticed something written down above the names of the politicians but had traces of being erased. Thinking about it a little, it felt kinda unnatural. Something written down in pencil but later erased. I could but at the same time could not see it, so I tried to gently smear it over with a pencil, having it placed atop my desk. And thus, the erased characters were once again visible. No sooner than having my eyes land on it, I ended up dropping the memo pad from my hand. I was too overwhelmed with shock.</p>



<p>The name that was written above bigshot politicians.<br>Because that name was…</p>



<p>Kusora Yurea.</p>



︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>— A few days ago.</p>



<p>On the day when Hasegawa was appointed to be a member of the social parties.<br>1 hour before the opening of the party.</p>



<p>A single woman accompanied by bodyguards appeared at the top floor of the building. And Akemine, as soon as she took notice of this, scampered hurriedly towards the scene.</p>



<p>&#8220;For you to have all the way here, is there something the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m bored. So I thought of coming over to take a look at the faces of men who have lost all reason and drowned into madness.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so… Of course, please help yourself.&#8221;</p>



<p>Fidgeting along the way, Akemine guided her to the VIP room. However, the woman shook off her hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Not that place. I&#8217;ll be playing around outside of the room.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes? That&#8217;s…?&#8221;</p>



<p>The woman made a strained smile at the puzzled Akemine.</p>



<p>&#8220;Would you care to dress me up as a woman intending to fool around with men? More appropriately, because&nbsp; I plan to stroll around the place and enjoy myself.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m afraid I can&#8217;t let that pass. If the men misunderstand something and come assaulting you, then what do you plan to…&#8221;</p>



<p>At those words, bodyguards standing behind her immediately pointed their guns at her. As if she was saying that she had no need to worry about such a thing.</p>



<p>&#8220;I see you like to talk, woman. Aren&#8217;t you getting quite ahead of yourself these days?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I sincerely apologize!&#8221;</p>



<p>Akemine&#8217;s skin turned pale as she bowed down.</p>


<p>&#8220;Kimoto-san, I&#8217;m incredibly bored. May I wash it off here for a bit?&#8221;</p>



<p>The woman made a gesture with her hands as if to tell her to raise her head as she said so.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s… If you could give me a bit more…&#8221;</p>



<p>Akemine could not answer her. That was because she had absolutely no idea what was going through this woman&#8217;s head.</p>



<p>&#8220;Lend me some clothes. A dress that&#8217;s similar to the one you&#8217;re wearing.&#8221;</p>



<p>As she said so, she tossed off the worn out parka that she had been wearing till then. Her hair unkempt with the traces of a hat being worn, no matter who looked at her, they&#8217;d think of her attire as really shabby. Even so, her beauty could not be hidden.</p>



<p>&#8220;Could you also set my hair? I feel like this kind of appearance isn&#8217;t appropriate for a place like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, yes! Please come here.&#8221;</p>



<p>Afterwards, Akemine guided her to the room where all the girls that would keep the men company were gathered with prudence. And after 1 hour, the party commenced. Appropriately dressed up for the occasion, she walked around the entire top floor to her heart&#8217;s content, checking out the faces of those beastly men as if she was sightseeing.</p>



<p>However, her visage was very quickly drained of all its curiosity.</p>



<p>&#8220;How dull…&#8221;</p>



<p>As she muttered those words as if that was her catchphrase, there was a sudden spark of curiosity in her eyes. The face of a single man that was being guided by Akemine came into view. A face that she was aware of. And immediately, she tailed her, finally uttering the words at her who sat over the man as though riding a horse.</p>



<p>&#8220;Madam! They’re looking for you in the VIP room. Please leave matters here to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>With those words, she grabbed the puzzled Akemine&#8217;s arm and dragged her out of the room. Once out of the room, with her arm still being grasped, she said…</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What happened? To want to keep a man like that company…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? It piqued my interest a bit. Is that a no?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No. But incidentally, is he someone you know…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, not particularly.&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying so, she held out her hand. Akemine made an inquisitive expression, causing her to speak with an irritated face.</p>



<p>&#8220;The drug? You intended to make him have it in the end, didn&#8217;t you? I&#8217;ll make him take it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Really? Then is he really not someone you know…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what I said!&#8221;</p>



<p>Relaxing her dubious expression a little, Akemine placed the drug on her hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come back after about 10 minutes later.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right, once you return, I think… you&#8217;ll probably see me stripped naked, so I want you to make me wear them back with my scar as an excuse.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just do as I say!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I understand.&#8221;</p>



<p>She had no idea what she was planning to do, but it was impossible for her to disobey her. Slightly bowing, she parted ways and left the room&#8217;s vicinity.</p>



<p>&#8220;What a dull woman…&#8221;</p>



<p>Facing the retreating Akemine, she shook her head in disappointment and returned to the room where the man lay once again.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.17</strong></p>


<p>This whole time I&#8217;ve always been thinking of her as a kind person and the first woman to ever be worried for me. I was happy that she would no longer have to be dragged into the social parties. That&#8217;s why, I prayed that it wasn&#8217;t the case. However, no matter how many times I checked, the name at the top of the memo was indeed Kusora Yurea.</p>



<p>Was it a miss? Even if it was done by that wicked, thorough-evidence-gathering Akemine? There&#8217;s no way.</p>



<p>Let&#8217;s try going over my incidents with her. Thinking about it after cooling off a little, there were two things that came to mind.</p>



<p>The first was her ranking displayed by the scouter. A mind-numbing &#8216;A&#8217;.<br>Frankly speaking, this alone should&#8217;ve been enough for me to stay doubtful of her. But at some point, all the distrust I had for her had completely vanished.</p>



<p>The second was when she spoke to me as if she was giving a hint — about things being shaky between Akemine and the yakuza. They were supposed to be at odds with each other these last few days, but in fact they were not. I tried to aggravate the discord between them by believing Kusora&#8217;s words, but I ended up getting counterattacked by them and dying.</p>



<p>In the end, the only absolute method was this. There was no choice but to hear it from the person herself. I immediately grabbed my phone and called her place. The call rang for a few seconds. But remembering how it took a while last time, I waited a little. After waiting to the point when it started to get on my nerves, I finally heard someone&#8217;s voice from the receiver&#8217;s end.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello.&#8221;</p>



<p>A voice that I had gotten used to hearing.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello.&#8221;</p>



<p>For the time being, I decided to reply back in my usual tone. However, when I actually thought of asking her, I couldn&#8217;t get the words out of my mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um…&#8221;</p>



<p>As I struggled to talk to her directly, she seemed to have realized that it was me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oji-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Could we meet up for a bit?&#8221;</p>



<p>I couldn&#8217;t completely break the ice on phone.<br>That&#8217;s why I thought of showing her the memo directly to get an answer out from her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Right away?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah… I&#8217;ll be waiting at the same bus stop. Could you come asap?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Hello? Oji-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>Without even waiting for a reply, I cut the call… and promptly made my way to the place where I first met her. There were no changes in her voice or tone at the other end of the receiver. A voice with the warmth that wouldn&#8217;t discriminate against even me. And to think that she could be a backer of that Akemine. There has to be some kind of mistake.</p>



<p>As I waited sitting on the bench at the stop for about thirty minutes, she finally showed up. In her usual parka and jeans. Just like that morning when we met up after the social party had ended, she approached me and sat next to me on the bench.</p>



<p><a id="c" href="#c"></a>&#8220;Calling me out so suddenly… Is something the matter?&#8221;</p>



<p>There were no signs of any changes in her. With my heart thumping wildly, I inadvertently handed her the memo. With doubts creeping up her expression, she still received it and took a look. And then all of a sudden, with her shoulders springing up and down, she burst out in laughter.</p>


<p>&#8220;She wrote down all of this? I did think of her as an incredibly dull woman, but turned out to be even duller than I anticipated.&#8221;</p>



<p>And so, she let go of that memo piece. And just like that, it gently fell onto the bus stop pavement. Just as I was about to look at her reaction, the answer had already been given. There, I asked her, my voice trembling.</p>



<p>&#8221; … What on earth are you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oji-san! If you ask pointless stuff like that, I&#8217;ll get really pissed off.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Suddenly, her whole formal dialect took a turn to the casual. An abrupt change in her manner of speech. Although the way she addressed me as &#8216;Oji-san&#8217; still sounded as gentle as usual, her expression had no signs of it. It was incredibly haughty. The anger I held repressed in my heart came rising up. My hands startled to tremble. My trauma from high school was resurfaced.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make that face. It&#8217;s incredibly dull.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wh… what… is your true identity?!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I am simply me. Although I was indeed one of Kimoto&#8217;s backers, that was simply playing around? I was really bored. It was so incredibly dull that I wanted to hurry up and ready my hands, but… you came in. Ah right, she wasn&#8217;t really Kimoto, but… Akemine, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What!?&#8221;</p>




<p>&#8220;To be honest, even I didn&#8217;t know that. I have no interest in that woman&#8217;s real name or whatever. It was all… due to the course of events? Since Oji-san asked me what her full name was, I had it be investigated.</p>



<p>Kusora continued to smile as she spoke away. And then as she did, she suddenly brought her face close to mine and lightly looked up at me.</p>



<p>&#8220;By the way, what&#8217;s <em>your</em> true identity?&#8221;</p>



<p>At that moment, her expression was incredibly terrifying. The switch from smiling to having a serious expression was way too extreme. However, I wasn&#8217;t able to comprehend what she was saying.</p>



<p>&#8220;Again with that face. Well it&#8217;s fine. Since you were to entertain me, I&#8217;ll specially give you a little explanation. I&#8217;m not that nice of a person, so consider this your good fortune. In this country&#8217;s underworld, there&#8217;s a person operating behind the scenes. WHo do you think that is?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What…? In the underworld?&#8221;</p>



<p>I inadvertently asked her to repeat her words at the unexpected question she gave me. And thanks to that, her expression very easily turned rigid.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you give me such a dull reply one more time, you might end up dying, Oji-san.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>For some reason, the instant I asked her to repeat herself, I could hear the glass pane of the bus stop waiting area shattering and crumbling down. Startled, I turned my gaze towards the shattered glass. When I looked back at her, her hand was folded in the shape of a gun with the tip of her finger lightly placed on my chest.</p>



<p>&#8220;It was the glass pane right now, but… next time, it might end up being Oji-san&#8217;s turn to have the bullet lodge into your body… Right. Into. This. Heart.&#8221;</p>



<p>Cold sweat ran down my forehead. The rage that was welling up inside me vanished and was suddenly replaced by intense fear and dread. Putting her level aside, looks like I ended up poking on a hornet&#8217;s nest without knowing fear. A woman upon whom one must never lay their hands upon.</p>



<p>&#8220;Answer me again. You get one last chance.&#8221;</p>



<p>Curling up a smile once again, she asked me the same question. Even if it my head had to suffer an impact to get the gears in my head running again, I had no choice but to do it. Trauma or whatever, preserving my life comes first. I was hesitating on what I should answer with, but… the moment I tried to spout something, it just slipped out. And my hand was already on its way towards the load window. I wonder if my hands would still move if I got shot by gun. How scary.</p>



<p>&#8220;You……?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fuhahaha, as expected, that&#8217;s so like you! Me? Someone who&#8217;s in this kind of attire? How could you possibly reach such an answer? Is everything all right in your head? Fufufufu.&#8221;</p>



<p>Although she said all that, thankfully, her mood seemed to have improved. It was no longer the same as the expression she had when she had the bullet come flying. As I heaved a sigh of relief, she continued to speak.</p>



<p>&#8220;But you&#8217;d be half correct.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;More precisely, it&#8217;s my grandfather who has enormous influence over this country. Primarily the underworld. All the politicians you see listed down in that memo were raised by us, so we have the appropriate power over their circles. The Prime Minister or the parliament members might change when their terms have ended, but that&#8217;s not the case for my grandfather. That&#8217;s why… it&#8217;s not very interesting. I don&#8217;t have a father. He&#8217;s dead. That&#8217;s why everything that belongs to Ojii-san<a id="s1" href="#n1"><sup>[1]</sup></a> also belongs to me. That&#8217;s pretty much it.&#8221;</p>



<p>There was nothing I could say in rebuttal. If that was indeed the case, then she would be the modern version of a princess. That too not a powerless princess locked up in her castle, but one holding immense authority. Being Rank A was only obvious. There&#8217;s probably nobody who&#8217;d be more appropriate to be Rank A.</p>



<p>&#8220;And so, I was able to obtain anything I wanted ever since I was a child. My grandfather being the only blood relative I had, he&#8217;d ceaselessly invest everything in me. Always continuing on in order to succeed this dull household. I don&#8217;t want that. And thanks to that, who knows how many times I became bored as a child. That&#8217;s why I really hate dull things. Everything turns out exactly how I predict they would. This world that keeps spinning like a cogwheel is utterly dull. Truthfully, even now I&#8217;m a bit fed up with it… Say, wouldn&#8217;t it be a bit interesting if your head suddenly explodes?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;C-Calm down. Put down that hand.&#8221;</p>



<p>Hearing her say such a thing as if she was trampling onto some passing bug, I sunk in terror and reflexively shifted away a little. Seeing me react like that, she started laughing once again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu, I&#8217;m joking, I&#8217;m joking. Don&#8217;t be so scared. You&#8217;re one of the very few people who managed to overturn my expectations, so I won&#8217;t kill you off that easily.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I overturned your expectations?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yup, that too twice. Thanks to that I was able to press on through the boredom. My interest has been piqued.&#8221;</p>



<p>So, I overturned her expectations… and twice at that? That&#8217;s a first. But in order to give, my curiosity was sprung. I must hear out so I can overturn her expectations once again. Having already become entangled with her, if I try running away at this rate, then the next bullet will surely be shot at me. But if I ask her what actions exactly caused her expectations to be overturned, then she&#8217;d probably call it dull again. In other words, it&#8217;d be my death sentence.</p>



<p>&#8220;Tell me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? Tell you what?&#8221;</p>



<p>I wonder if my reply was surprising or not, but she tilted her head and asked again. Alright, that&#8217;s not a bad reaction.</p>



<p>&#8220;Your impression from when I overturned your expectations.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Tell you my impression? You&#8217;re quite the brazen individual, Oji-san. Well it&#8217;s fine, I guess.&#8221;</p>



<p>I ended up heaving another sigh of relief. If I play this game of back and forth with her any more than this, I&#8217;ll die. I slowly brought my hand towards the load window again with caution. If her expression turns the least bit scary, I&#8217;ll click it immediately.</p>



<p>&#8220;The first was when we first met. At times, just to observe people, I ask around if anybody would be willing to sleep with me. The whole humble attitude and formal speech is like a uniform for times like those. You were also one of such people to be caught in such a facade. No, I <em>thought</em> you were caught, but you really surprised me. Whether it was you not bargaining after I gave you a discount for having seen my scar, or that you not finding it unpleasant, or when you feigned your magnanimity by saying you&#8217;d still give me the original amount we agreed upon, all three instances caught me off guard. And moreover, asking to go for a meal? To me? It was <em>quite </em>amusing. To think you&#8217;d overturn my expectations in that manner… But since I was able to kill some time, I let you off alive. Say, do you know? Which one of the three not happening would make you out? Once you accept my invitation and enter the love hotel, there&#8217;s no longer any method for you to remain alive. But… having a meal together… It was a first for me to receive such a shock. I&#8217;ve been repeating this pattern every single time for the long awaited day I could finally meet someone like you. In search of someone who&#8217;d be able to distract me from this boredom.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is-Is that so.&#8221;</p>



<p>At that time… looks like it was the correct choice to not do her. As expected, it was a trap. An extreme one at that. Salute to you, past me. But her impressions had yet to finish.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh by the way, why didn&#8217;t you find it strange? Even though the scar is so bad that the traces of the burns are still visible, would there be any prostitute sane enough to enter a love hotel with something like this and yet immediately strip down? Normally, they&#8217;ll want to keep them on, wouldn&#8217;t they? Don&#8217;t you think so too? Fufu.&#8221;</p>



<p>Indeed, she&#8217;s got a point. Frankly, even I thought that was weird. It&#8217;s just that I couldn&#8217;t put it into words. So it ended with me simply hearing her out. I didn&#8217;t want to make light of the situation and end up inviting danger.</p>



<p>&#8220;And then what, ramen? It was the first time I ever had it, but it was quite good. It was also my first time dining in such a place<a id="s2" href="#n2"><sup>[2]</sup></a>. I wanted to go to such a place some day, that&#8217;s why I thought I&#8217;d agree to go with you. Since it didn&#8217;t turn out the way I thought it would, it was pretty fun, and coming from me, take it as words of praise, Oji-san. And so, the second time would be when I lied about Akemine and the yakuza being on bad terms in order to trap you. I was aware that everyone sent to investigate her organization was killed. That woman is quite sensitive to things like that. That&#8217;s why… I thought of testing you out a little. I wanted to see if you would end up dead or not thanks to false information. To be honest, I thought you&#8217;d die. But I was off the mark again. Rather, to have also unveiled Akemine&#8217;s true identity that not even I was aware of, and then sabotage the social parties themselves… Fufu.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And thus we&#8217;re back to the main topic… What&#8217;s <em>your</em> true identity, Oji-san?&#8221;</p>



<p>Her expression had once again shifted away from normal. She got closer to me and shot out that question. The question that I heard once before as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;True identity? I&#8217;m just a regular citizen, though.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t make me laugh. Your bank account was completely protected. I don&#8217;t know if it&#8217;s thanks to some foreign country or not, but it&#8217;s the first time I wasn&#8217;t able to obtain information that I wanted. That&#8217;s why… spit it out… Your true identity.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course I&#8217;m just a regular citizen, but at the same time, I&#8217;m not. At the very least, in this world…&#8221;</p>



<p>To my words, she made the expression saying &#8216;What nonsense are you spouting?&#8217;. However, I can&#8217;t have myself spill everything about the game. Speaking of which, as expected, the game&#8217;s powers were indeed absolute. If a woman wielding insane authority like her couldn&#8217;t gather information about me, then there&#8217;s no way someone who can, exists. This itself was precious info.</p>



<p>&#8220;However, if someone like that alone was around you, wouldn&#8217;t it be less boring?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fufu. Is that so? I got it. If you say that, I&#8217;ll be expecting a lot. Continue to save me from this incredibly dull world. I&#8217;m not really your enemy per se. Akemine? Like I said before, I only went to take a look underneath to kill some time. Whether it&#8217;s the social parties or the drug, they have no direct relation to me. Even going to that party that day was a first for me. Should I let you in on something? Although I dressed as a prostitute, I&#8217;m still a virgin, Oji-san. I might just give it to you if you manage to satiate my expectations. And I mean it, fufu.&#8221;</p>
