<h3>Chapter 13 &#8211; The Praying Misanga</h3>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Ten
days passed after we started exploring the dungeon and exchanging the magic
stones.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Dark-san!
Gold-san, Nemumu-san!"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Early
morning, as we lined up at the end of the line to enter the dungeon, we were
approached from behind.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
and the others came running to us, waving their hands.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
dungeons in this city are usually explored for long periods, we hadn't seen
them for a while.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Today,
Erio and the others also carry their luggage for outdoor camping.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
been a while, Erio-san. It's been a while since we fought the Great Bush
wolf."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"That's
right. In other dungeons, it may be different, but in this town, camping inside
the dungeon is normal. It's really difficult to see each other if the timing isn't
right. I'm really lucky that I finally got a chance to give you a thank you
gift today!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"A
thank you gift?"</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
couldn't help but tilt my head at the unexpected words.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
and the others are smiling as if they are handing out presents at a surprise
party.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
nudges his sister Miya, who is hiding behind him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Miya
suggested that I give something back to you for all the help you gave me
before. Miya, you're going to give it to Dark-san, right?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
know, I know, don't push me, Oniichan....... Dark-san, this is a trivial item,
but please accept it if you don't mind."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
pulls out a small bivalve from her pocket and holds them out to me with both
hands, her face turning red.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
small enough to fit in the palm of a child.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I am
a bit confused, but I take the bivalve from her hand.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"This
is......?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
a burn medicine I learned from my late grandmother a long time ago. It can't
erase the burn scars, but thought it could provide some relief for Dark-san's
burns....... I wanted to thank you at least for your help. Did I bother
you?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
looks at me and asks worriedly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">For
the first time since I left Naraku, I was given a gift out of pure goodwill.
The quality of the gift was probably average, but her feeling made me very
happy.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
grabbed the bivalve that contained the burn medicine and thanked her.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
no bother at all. Thank you so much. I'm glad.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
couldn't satisfy myself just with words of gratitude, so I went through my
pockets.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
wanted to give her something in return.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(It
would be too suspicious to pull out a shield, sword, or knife from my pocket.
In exchange for one medicine, that would be too exaggerated. Then maybe a small
item or accessory would be better?)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Not
an expensive-looking ring or necklace with jewels on it.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Instead
of expensive-looking rings and necklaces with jewels, she could receive
something more suitable for her dungeon exploring.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Thinking
fast, I pull out one of the "Infinite Gacha" cards.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Before
taking it out of my pocket, I activated the card.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Please
accept this as a thank you for the medicine."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Wow,
beautiful......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
the palm of my hand, there is a misanga woven with red thread.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It's
the "SSR, the Praying Misanga".</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Although
it is a high-rank item, it is a magic item with a rather abstract effect. It's
an item that can cause small miracles through strong wishes.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
actually tried to test its function in an experiment, but no "small
miracles" occurred at that time.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
though it has a high Gacha rank, its activation conditions and effects are
still a mystery.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
since it is the same color as Miya's red hair, it will not look bad even if she
wears it every day.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Also,
since it is woven with thread, it will not get in the way and can be used as an
accessory for everyday use.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
gacha rank is a little high, but it doesn't look expensive, and it' not a bad
return gift.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
was flustered, perhaps because she didn't expect the return gift.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ah,
the medicine was really not that great, and I can't afford to get such a
beautiful misanga in return. And......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Her
eyes roam to behind me.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu,
who is behind me, whispering to herself.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I,
I'm so jealous that Dark-sama gave her a present....... I'm so
jealous......."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nemumu,
I understand how you feel, but you must calm down. Are you trying to ruin our
Lord's reputation by scaring a little girl?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">If
so, I will not forgive you."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"......
Nemumu, Gold."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"My
apologies, Dark-sama.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It
seems I talked too much. I hope you'll forgive me."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Both
of them went upright at my voice.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
cleared my throat again and turned to Miya and the others.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Not
only did you give me the medicine, but you also made me feel happy. So please
accept it. Please."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
is my honest feeling.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">That's
why I gave her this misanga as a gift. It suits her and may help her as an
adventurer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
looked back at her brother and her childhood friends. After seeing them nod,
she took the misanga without hesitation.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you, Dark-san."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
grabbed the misanga with both hands and smiled, looking very happy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I am
glad that she is happy, and I smile back.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Miya,
that's good."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
red color looks so good on you, Miya!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">You
have great taste, Dark-san!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(chuckles)</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
blushed as she is praised by her brother Erio and their childhood friends Gimra
and Wardy.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Before
she went into the dungeon, she put the misanga on her left arm right in front
of us.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Thank
you very much, Dark-san. I'll treasure it forever."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Miya
then thanked us again with a big smile on her face.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">☆</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
entering the dungeon, we move to a quiet place as usual.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
hide with SSR, Presence Concealment, and fly with SR, Flight, towards the
dungeon stairs that lead to the second level.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
flying, we had a conversation about our interactions with Erio and the others.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
not saying I wasn't jealous, but what she gave you was a really low-quality
medicine. It's clearly not worth the price of the SSR, Praying Misanga!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
true that the medicine itself doesn't worth much, but I was happy with their
sincerity."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"There
is nothing to be ashamed of, my Lord. If you gave me a sword, armor, or jeweled
accessory, I would have remonstrated you. But my Lord thought about the girl
and gave her a misanga in a color that suited her. It was a very smart move,
and I have nothing to complain about. In fact, in that situation, Nemumu should
have taken the initiative to support you. Isn't acknowledging rival is a trait
of a good woman."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">''Oh,
no, no, no......, only this time Gold's statement is too good to argue
with!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Wahahahahaha!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Nemumu,
your devotion is not enough! Devotion!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nemumu
frowned in frustration, and Gold laughed happily.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
laughing out loud for a while, Gold praised me.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
think we are winning the hearts of those young men with our actions so far. If
our name becomes famous in the future, they will talk about today here and
there, and the Lord's reputation will be raised. It is not only strength that
makes one famous, but also kindness and character. At first, I thought it was a
whim to help them, but I guess this is what you wanted, right? As expected of
my Lord! That's really an ingenious scheme."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Is,
is that true, Dark-sama?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No
way, you misunderstood. I never expected to be involved with them to this
extent."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
didn't really mean to help them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
leaving Naraku, if I go shopping, people try to trick me, or other races looked
down on me because of my race.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
the purity of these youngsters made me think, "This world is not so bad
after all," so I helped them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
are no hidden motives like Gold and Nemumu thought.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
though I denied it, Gold didn't believe me and replied, "Too much humility
can be sarcasm", while Nemumu replied, "As expected of Dark-sama!
Nemumu's eyes widened and shining with respect.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
were about to reach the stairs that led to the second level, and I gave up on
trying to convince them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">With
a faint smile on my face, <span>I went down from the sky to the
ground then walks toward the stairs leading to the second floor.</span></span></p>
