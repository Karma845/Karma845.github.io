<p class="calibre10">The seasons have wheeled a cycle since the Battle of Erbelde.  Three full years have passed from the day I first enlisted in the Order.</p><p class="calibre10">The Mareschal Tallien was no longer to be found in the 5th, having retired to consummate his heirship to the title of viscount.  The under-mareschal, too, had left the 5th’s halls, returning to his homeland upon news of the untimely death of his elder brother, to whom was due the succession of the family name.</p><p class="calibre10">That left the role of mareschal to none other than the lieutenant of the Owlcranes: Emilie.  To be promoted to such an esteemed position at so young an age was most unusual, indeed.</p><p class="calibre10">Central itself had taken great heed of the “Aureola of the 5th”.  And more fervently still did the officers of our Order revere her very presence.  Fresh still in their minds was her valiant figure, standing shoulder-to-shoulder with the hero-dame Tiselius at the banks of the Erbelde, her silvered thunderblade rending asunder the fell droves of Nafílim.  A veritable idol, whose resplendent reputation was, by this point, set deep in stone.</p><p class="calibre10">As for the Owlcranes, the role of lieutenant was passed to Gerd.  And on another front was Felicia with a promotion of her own: no longer was she lieutenant to the 1st Sorcery Brigade, but brigadier to the three Sorcery Brigades altogether.  Her phenomenal flair for the magicks had rightfully earned her the esteem of being the 5th’s foremost spellweaver by far.</p><p class="calibre10">And there was I, yet a swain&mdash;Emilie’s, of course.  But if being swain to a mareschal, up from that of a lieutenant, was anything to go by, then I suppose one could say I’ve moved up in the world.</p><p class="calibre10">Only, both my duties and my daily life at the Order had gained no greater prestige.  Sword training, horse-tending, gear-caring, housecleaning, and sword training yet again&mdash;my routine had hardly changed at all.</p><p class="calibre10">I was, at the moment, tidying up the mareschal’s chamber.  Emilie herself was sat upon a leather chair before a grand desk, flanked by decorative standards.  In her hands were many papers, to which she gave a glance over.  And a glance upon this newly appointed mareschal herself would reveal in her a newly assimilated mien of majesty, as it were.  A recent development of character, perhaps one precipitated by the rigours and expectations of her current station.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf, we’ve drawn up plans for the next operation,” Emilie said.  “Come and have a look, if you can?”</p><p class="calibre10">A rather prideful glow was about her face as she held out the papers to me.</p><p class="calibre10">“Plans, my Lady?” I blinked.  Taking them, my sight fell upon the cover page.  “Classified materials&mdash;are you certain?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I am.”</p><p class="calibre10">Writ large was the line “Operations Manual for the Recapture of the Godrika Minery”.</p><p class="calibre10">The march of Norden, home to the 5th’s headquarters, also held within its southern reaches the foresaid mines of Godrika.  Well-known for their warrens of well-endowed deposits these mines were, but equally so were they feared for their depths that bristled with the behemót: malicious fiends of myriad forms, all imparted with odyl of their own.  And the manual I held in my hand was symbolic of our kingdom’s craving for the recapture of such a bedevilled place.</p><p class="calibre10">I thumbed through the pages.  Immediately apparent was the scope of the operation.  By no means was it a meagre one.</p><p class="calibre10">These days had often found Emilie locked behind closed doors till the late hours, immersed in meetings within which no swains were suffered.  That’s not to say such meetings are a rarity at all in a place like the Order, but it seemed their purposes of late were tasked specifically to the planning of this operation.</p><p class="calibre10">A report within the papers indicated that, at present, the threat levels within the mines were on a downward trend.  So much so, in fact, that it was very much possible for just the 5th to barge in and clean house.</p><p class="calibre10">The strategies and tactics required to do so were outlined to granular detail further on in the papers.  From group compositions to logistics, all was accounted for; even the march to the minery itself was not spared of its fair share of attention, a clear lesson learned from the failures at the Erbelde this past year.</p><p class="calibre10">All in all, it was a manual written and considered with exhaustive care for every aspect of the operation, no matter how large or little.  This, I judged, but what I also judged was the spectre of underestimation: inadequate thought was given to the difficulty in deploying troops into so confined an environment as a web of underground tunnels.  Not to mention that the plans themselves called for too wide and thin a dispersal of troops at every level of the operation.</p><p class="calibre10">But beyond such details, there was one matter that cast a deep shadow over the entire affair…</p><p class="calibre10">“My Lady,” I began, looking up from the papers.  “I believe these plans are in need of some reassessments.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…Reassessments?” Emilie blinked.  “Where, exactly?”</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Where’, might not be the word.  If I may be blunt, this operation’s actionability itself must needs be reexamined.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…What?  How can you say that!?” Emilie gasped, clearly taken aback.  But within her voice, there also smouldered a tinge of anger.</p><p class="calibre10">I could tell that much and more went into the creation of this manual.  In fact, it was, beyond anyone’s doubt, an exemplary and scrupulous piece of work.  A product of untold toil, moulded precisely at every seam and corner by a girl bent on fulfilling the obligations of her high office, despite her tender age of eighteen.</p><p class="calibre10">To be met with dissent may have proven too much for such a soul to bear.  Yet I could not with good conscience support this plan.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie spoke once more.  “Rolf, need I remind you of all that our kingdom stands to gain should we capture these mines?”</p><p class="calibre10">She did not.</p><p class="calibre10">The success of this operation had far-reaching consequences for this kingdom’s war strategy going forward&mdash;that, in itself, augured much ill.</p><p class="calibre10">“We would gain much, true, but I believe that there loom losses greater again,” I reasoned.  “Godrika offers us only silver, my Lady&mdash;nothing else.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m fully aware.  But ‘tis the sheer bounty of the silver itself that is more the point, Rolf!”</p><p class="calibre10">Londosius ever craves silver, but not for want of filled purses and packed coffers.  The metal’s uses are strictly determined and regulated within our borders.  So it is that even by digging up vast volumes of this argent commodity, not a speck of it would be tasked to the enrichment of the life of any citizen in this kingdom.</p><p class="calibre10">“Silver is a resource most precious to our military pillars, my Lady, one that our kingdom forbids the export of.  All that we extract from Godrika goes into meeting the demands of the war effort.  Put simply, we stock our store of silver and our armies shall swell along with it.”</p><p class="calibre10">Let it be made absolutely clear that Godrika’s depths are deeply engorged in ore deposits.  Obtaining this seemingly boundless bounty would likely be nothing short of a historic vicissitude for Londosius, one that would usher in an exponential expansion of its military might.</p><p class="calibre10">“Listen, Rolf.  Suppose for a moment we capture Godrika, and put silver arms and armour into the hands of all of our officers.  You must know just how tremendous of an advantage that avails us in our fight against the Nafílim?”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie’s attempt at persuasion was not without reason or merit.  That much silver would surely turn the war heavily in our favour.</p><p class="calibre10">However…</p><p class="calibre10">“Think of all the comrades-in-arms we can save!” Emilie continued.  “And our families!  Our loved ones!  But more than anything, it brings us so much closer to ending the Nafílim once and for all.”</p><p class="calibre10">That was where she strayed.</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay, my Lady.  Godrika only portends a greater need of gravestones for our comrades.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And why’s that!?”</p><p class="calibre10">“The battles we bear at present are plenty enough, yet Central seeks to stretch the lines of each of these battlefields all the more.  The burdens upon them will weigh heavily and heavier still should we arm and sharpen ourselves further&mdash;burdens Central is overeager to heave upon us.”</p><p class="calibre10">Gain a greater advantage, and troops will be made to fight ever more ferociously.  And the harder they press on, the wider and more bloodsoaked the battlefields will become&mdash;the momentum of war is as an avalanche, unrelenting, all-consuming.</p><p class="calibre10">“Burden?  The only burden I see is the one upon your shoulders,” Emilie countered.  “Proof, Rolf!  Have you any at all?  That Central would be so insatiable!?”</p><p class="calibre10">“None, my Lady.”  But of course.  All I’d spoken of thus far was circumstantial in nature.</p><p class="calibre10">“Then why speak against it so!?” yelled Emilie, taken with an unusual bout of anger.</p><p class="calibre10">Against such roaring emotions, I did my best to keep calm as I continued on.  “Furthermore, I cannot see the need to bring an end to all Nafílim .”</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…!?”</p><p class="calibre10">A remark tending slightly towards treason, I admit.  After all, Londosius dearly tasks its every sword and sinew towards the annihilation of the Nafílim .</p><p class="calibre10">Yet I could not relent.</p><p class="calibre10">“My Lady, it betrays reason to expect that we may ever bring about the extinction of any kind.”</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Tis precisely why we toil away in our duties, is it not!?  That we might usher in some chance to an impossibility?” Emilie rebutted.  “Rolf, we have momentum in this war!  Were we to stay the path at all costs, then surely the day would come!  The day when the war is done at last&mdash;and the Nafílim along with it!”</p><p class="calibre10">That, right there.</p><p class="calibre10">All within this kingdom are taken with this belief&mdash;a zeitgeist, binding every beating heart of every living soul within this realm.  It is the core of the country, a policy in and of itself, absolute and immutable.</p><p class="calibre10">But I was shaken from those shackles.</p><p class="calibre10">The Battle of Erbelde.</p><p class="calibre10">I had fought her then, that child Nafíl.  As we measured blades together within the Nafílim encampment, my own heart began to beat to a different belief.</p><p class="calibre10">She, too, gambled all and more in that battle.</p><p class="calibre10">But why?</p><p class="calibre10">She stood steadfast upon that battlefield, her life wasting on with every wager and every peril faced, while her own heart blazed with a desperation most dear&mdash;such was what I gleaned from her as she frantically flourished those daggers of hers.</p><p class="calibre10">A soul that readily risks everything to protect something&mdash;could such a soul truly be evil?</p><p class="calibre10">I could not know.  Not then.  Not now.</p><p class="calibre10">But what I did know was that to be “done” with the Nafílim was folly most foul.  That genocide would see this conflict to its proper end was something I could not accept.</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Tis naught but a path of pure carnage you would have us walk, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You speak nonsense, Rolf!”</p><p class="calibre10">By this point, Emilie was all but boiling and livid.  What’s done is done, as they say, thus at risk of fanning her flames further, I ventured forth in voicing yet one more reason to this unreasonable conversation.</p><p class="calibre10">“Moreover, I cannot abet the soundness of this operation, if it executes on grounds that the threat within the mines is thinned.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Threat? <i class="calibre3">Threat,</i> Rolf?  ‘Twas none other than you who came up with the calculations for measuring such threats!”</p><p class="calibre10">Indeed, it was.</p><p class="calibre10">Threat levels: separate a given theatre of operations into a set of distinct areas, and thereafter calculate the perceived danger based on the observed number of hostiles present within each.</p><p class="calibre10">This was what I recommended to her previously, and to this day was a method yet employed.  In fact, it was by these very same means that the threat levels within Godrika were determined to be in decline.  One could even say that it was by my own hands that this operation came to be in the first place, however directly or otherwise.</p><p class="calibre10">But the numbers written in the manual whispered to me of a somewhat… “unusual” stir within the mines.</p><p class="calibre10">“I believe the behemót may have vacated themselves rather too asudden.  Why this came to be bears much needed consideration and scrutiny,” I explained.</p><p class="calibre10">“What do you mean?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I mean that, as an example, a menace of a behemá may have made itself home in the mines, and by its ruthless nature, has been weeding out its weaker kin.”</p><p class="calibre10">“What’s this?  A ‘menace of a behemá’, you say?  Your fancies have taken a flight too far, Rolf!”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie may have been right.  I merely wished to elucidate any and all potential risks, but in my wanton efforts, I may have seemed overmuch the feeble-witted fowl pecking at too large a ground for too meagre a meal.</p><p class="calibre10">“Perhaps they have, my Lady.  Perhaps there is no such specimen.  But just as well, it simply may be that our scouts have not discovered it as of yet.”</p><p class="calibre10">To this, Emilie deeply sighed&mdash;likely an attempt at calming her own errant emotions.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf.  I understand well that your place here may become all the more perilous should we avail our armouries with more silver.  But I’m the mareschal of this Order now.  Much injury and injustice it has done you, I know.  Yet with me as its commander, I’ll make certain that you’ll not be ailed by such abuse any longer.”</p><p class="calibre10">Her words were as resolute as her unwavering gaze upon my own.</p><p class="calibre10">“I am ever and always your ally, Rolf,” Emilie went on.  “But just as I would give my all for you, I need you to do the same for me&mdash;to think upon yourself, of what it means to be a knight, of why we fight with so much desperation.  Won’t you do this for me?”</p><p class="calibre10">Knighthood&mdash;my dearest ambition.</p><p class="calibre10">What is a knight, really?</p><p class="calibre10">For what, and for whom do we fight?</p><p class="calibre10">Had I known the answers to such, would I have long been a knight myself?  A man worthy of respect?  Perhaps not to the same measure as Emilie, of course, but at the very least, someone to whom any soul would be glad to treat with a tinge of regard?</p><p class="calibre10">Certainly, no man could hope to be knighted were he to voice overmuch his dissent towards the will of the Order, or to nurture within himself the notion that his own beliefs were more righteous again than the Order’s own.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet…</p><p class="calibre10">What is to be said of an Order that is so quick to quell a man’s wish to live virtuously?  Does a man not choose to don his armour and defend his fealty that he may be as honourable a soul as his lot would allow?  I could not for the life of me make myself an abettor of this operation, not for as long as I spied within its success the temptation to let loose the leashes upon Londosius’ lions of war.</p><p class="calibre10">The moment I knew myself to be ungraced was the moment I resolved to never be constrained by cowardice.  This, I had sworn upon my very heart.</p><p class="calibre10">A man who becomes a knight by betraying his own constancy for his own convenience, who but wavers when his better wits beg him to be unwavering&mdash;such a man, to me, is no knight.</p><p class="calibre10">And that was exactly why I could not put upon my lips the words that Emilie so wanted to hear.</p><p class="calibre10">“Even still, my Lady.  I am opposed to this operation,” I reasserted.</p><p class="calibre10">At once, all hale was sapped from Emilie’s face.  And after a lamenting sigh, she spoke these next words.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf.  This is what the Order itself has decided upon.  Such strategic matters shall neither heed nor abide dissent from a mere swain.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…My apologies, Mareschal.”</p><p class="calibre10">With that, I resumed my chores.  For her part, Emilie leaned back deeply into her leather chair and turned up to the ceiling, eyes brought to a full close.</p><p class="calibre10">The compromises we make.</p><p class="calibre10">The compromises we forsake.</p><p class="calibre10">Those who are changed.</p><p class="calibre10">Those who are yet the same.</p><p class="calibre10">No boy or girl can remain so coddled in the cradle forever.  Such a doubtless and unspotted truth this was, but for the fool who could neither accept it nor ever let go of the treasures of his childhood, what could he do?</p><p class="calibre10">Naught but stay silent and keep cleaning that cold room.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">The Godrika Minery&mdash;its fallowed fathoms slept beneath the southern region of the march of Norden.  Well-known it was for, amongst other things, its wealth of unexploited veins of silver ore.</p><p class="calibre10">Forty winters ago saw its discovery by an exploration team, and shortly after were picks and shovels sent to strike away at the shafts, with tunnels spreading from them like roots.  But a mountain sat above it, already a veritable menagerie of boundless behemót.  By their beastly vehemence was Londosius’ hold on the mines broken, and the vacated underground labyrinth soon found itself festering with the vermin.  Not one year wheeled by before all mining ceased.</p><p class="calibre10">The campaign undertaken to recapture that wicked warren was met with misery.  Securing the surface was painless enough, but it was the tunnels that proved to be the salted sore, for their depths were rife with behemót of the frustratingly dreadful sort.  And that was to say nothing of the size of the tunnels themselves, too narrow in their girth to support the infiltration of any substantial force.  As a result, Godrika’s prized silver veins yet remained beyond the grasp of Londosius’ war-itching hands.</p><p class="calibre10">The last few months, however, saw the shrinking of the behemót’s numbers, and so were the threat levels of the place deemed to have diminished.  It was in this trend that Emilie spied an opportunity.  Thus the newly appointed mareschal saw fit to cast her own lot into the recapturing campaign, with the entirety of the 5th Chivalric Order arrayed and ready behind her.</p><p class="calibre10">Erbelde this was not.  The Godrika Minery, being in the same region the 5th itself was based, was reached with a relatively short and well-planned march, and our arrival saw us wholly untroubled by the trip.</p><p class="calibre10">“Oy, just givin’ that map another gander’s got me all mither’d,” Raakel complained. “What’s up with it, ey?  Looks more a maze than a mine, the damn’d place.”</p><p class="calibre10">At the foot of the looming mountain was the 5th’s leadership, gathered around under a pavilion.  There, they were in the midst of strategic discussions, their eyes fixed upon a full-splayed map.</p><p class="calibre10">“I’d say turning the place into a proper mine wasn’t the first thing the diggers thought to do, what when they arrived here all those decades ago,” Gerd observed.</p><p class="calibre10">Indeed, gold rushes were an unchecked affair&mdash;though “silver rush” might be more the term here.  From what my ears gathered, during those mad grabs for the glitter, it was by no means uncommon that spades and spells were blindly made to carve out the earth, backed as they were by nary a warrant or a word of coordination.  And Godrika itself seemed no different: another victim of Man’s ardour for his metals.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yea, an’ now thanks to them ol’ delvers, there be crags every which way, all ready to crumble down on us heads, innit?” the warrior shook her head.  “By gum, the ballocks o’ some folk!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Well then, Raakel, you’d be pleased to know that our surveyors have found the very stopes likely to cave in: here, here, and over here as well,” said Emilie, moving her finger along the red-marked map.  “Let it be known that engaging the behemót at any of these stopes is strictly prohibited.  This is especially true for the southern quadrant’s third sector; if our reports are precise, then that area is ready to collapse at the feather’s touch.  All brigades, please be advised and execute your offices with ample caution.”</p><p class="calibre10">To this, the 5th’s leadership collectively nodded.  Emilie continued on.</p><p class="calibre10">“Once noon is passed, we will proceed as planned: each squad will enter the tunnels, in order and as arranged.  They’re to clear out all behemót within their assigned routes and return to camp immediately.  If all goes accordingly, we’ll be done by sundown in two days hence.”</p><p class="calibre10">With the plans confirmed, Emilie then looked all through the gathered personnel.  It was then that her gaze shifted suddenly to me.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf.  Do you still object to this operation?”</p><p class="calibre10">It was not in her policy to accord me any sort of special treatment, even as her direct subordinate.  Aught otherwise would have proven unfair to the Order’s other swains.  Thus was it beyond anyone’s imagination that she would inquire upon my opinion so, here at a war council of all occasions.</p><p class="calibre10">And to be clear, I was not sitting in the meeting as any sort of official attendant, whose opinion and counsel would have any bearing.  The very fact that she was now glaring into my eyes, trying to tease out the truth of my heart, may have betrayed some trouble in her own, apprehensive of my dissent as she was.</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay, Mareschal.  I am not in objection,” was my answer.  Our troops were right about ready to commence the operation; voicing my disapproval of the whole deal now would be profitless.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yet I hear nary a word that you are in agreement with it, either,” Emilie observed.</p><p class="calibre10">“…I will exhaust any and all faculties available to me to see this operation through, Mareschal,” I confirmed.  “But there is one matter, if I may.”</p><p class="calibre10">“What is it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“The deployment intervals bear some reconsideration.  I request that slightly more time be given between the deployment of each squad.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You beg for scraps overmuch, hound!” Gerd shouted, but a raised hand from Emilie was all it took to silence him.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf.  I would hear your reasoning.”</p><p class="calibre10">“There looms the possibility that the gangways will be overpacked with personnel.  Should this occur, our men stand to jostle against one another and impede each other’s manoeuvrability.  In other words, they’ll be bottlenecked,” I explained.</p><p class="calibre10">The squads were being made to infiltrate the tunnels in sequence, with little regard given to how many would be inside at once&mdash;therein lay my worries.</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Tis no matter.  Our plans make certain that such will not be a factor.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay, Mareschal.  These plans ill-account for unforeseen contingencies.  Were our men to be made to retreat, for example, their return paths will each be tangled up to much mayhem.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And were we to entangle ourselves in talk of contingencies, the sun shall set before we’ve sent in a single soldier, Rolf.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Any and all contingencies must be accounted for, Mareschal.  This, I believe.”</p><p class="calibre10">A cloud of irritation then misted over Emilie’s gaze.  My conduct ill-became that of a swain, I admit, but the current plans tempted much injury unto the Order, and so long as they did, I had to make them known.</p><p class="calibre10">“To begin with, is there so pressing a need to deploy so many groups into the tunnels at once?” I continued.  “Would we not avail ourselves further still were we to divide the minery into disparate areas, deploy each squad in shifts, and secure each area one after another?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf, you must know that doing so will extend the length of the operation.  Our days here are numbered; we cannot abide such deliberateness,” Emilie rebutted.  “And for that same reason, the deployment intervals cannot and will not be extended.”</p><p class="calibre10">Prolong the operation, and its expenses balloon with it.  With great repetition and meticulousness did Emilie scrutinise such costs.  As they were, the projected expenditures had Marquis Norden’s approval after much negotiation.  It was his coffers that funded not only the operation, but the whole of the 5th’s administration itself.  His word in this matter was final, and he would not be made to go back on it.</p><p class="calibre10">Thus it surely must have grated Emilie’s gears to even hear mention of “giving ourselves more time”.  I was keenly aware that it would, yet I pressed on.</p><p class="calibre10">“We stand to lose much should we operate beyond our allowance.  This, I understand very well.  But I also understand that any loss of personnel far outweighs it.”</p><p class="calibre10">“By gum, do ye hear yerself, muscle-pate?” Raakel came cutting in.  “Whimperin’ like a panick’d pup!  We’ve not even started an’ already yer yappin’ on ‘bout this ‘chance’ an’ ‘losses’ rubbish!”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m agreed with Raakel,” said Emilie.  “Mistake cowardice for caution and we do ourselves no favours.”</p><p class="calibre10">No good in the end, I see.  Going on any further would but beleaguer so set an issue.</p><p class="calibre10">“Understood, Mareschal,” I relented.</p><p class="calibre10">“Are you truly, Rolf?  Have I your word?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Aye.”</p><p class="calibre10">There was no choice but back down here.  I’ve apprised the mareschal of the potential flaws in her plans, given my reasoning for them, and presented possible solutions&mdash;I’ve all but done my duty, and if by her will my counsel was not to be heeded, then what was left to me was only to support her resolve.</p><p class="calibre10">“Then the war council is adjourned,” Emilie announced, returning her gaze to the other leaders.  “Squads all, please execute your offices as planned.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, madame!” came their collective salute, and so ended the pre-operation meeting.  The brigadiers and their lieutenants then dispersed and made way back to their own groups, with many of them offering me their cutting glares.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf, pardon the trouble, but can you return to the Owlcranes’ pavilion and make ready my gear?” Emilie requested.</p><p class="calibre10">“Right away, Mareschal.”</p><p class="calibre10">With that, I went about my own way, but was soon called upon by another leader.</p><p class="calibre10">“Brother,” she said.</p><p class="calibre10">“My Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">Felicia Buckmann, brigadier and commander of the entirety of the 5th’s Sorcery Brigades&mdash;and as well, my sister.</p><p class="calibre10">Knighthood itself is not counted amongst the Londosian peerage, like a duke or a marquis.  Rather, it was an occupation, and at times a title in the strictest sense.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet for a swain, every knight is a senior to whom proper respects must be paid and with honorifics must be addressed.  Myself especially&mdash;or rather, myself specifically.  Heretofore have I been addressing all knights and dames by “lord” and “lady” respectively, a remnant of Tallien’s authority.</p><p class="calibre10">When Emilie took up the mareschal’s mantle, she had the rule repealed.  Still, vestiges of the practice remained as a custom, for even now, those of the leadership were addressed with the appropriate honorifics.</p><p class="calibre10">Felicia fell squarely onto such a pedestal, having&mdash;at the end of her first year at the Order&mdash;received her rites of investiture and attained the rank of lieutenant.  From that point on, she was clearly beyond the stature of an ordinary dame; a leader, a superior, a paragon who should rightfully be referred to as “the Lady Felicia”.</p><p class="calibre10">And as a lowly swain, I was obliged to follow suit.</p><p class="calibre10">“Your words earlier,” my sister began.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, my Lady?”</p><p class="calibre10">“They seemed not the speech of a man who knows his place.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Perhaps not.”</p><p class="calibre10">Felicia’s attitude was hardly unjustified.  After all, her brother was an ungraced who writhed in the dirt at the end of every training session, who was assigned to little else but mundane chores, and who had yet to escape the yoke of swainhood after three full years of service in the Order.  In thinking of him, surely she felt only deep remorse.</p><p class="calibre10">“Did you think to make a savant of yourself, Brother?  Abetting for abundant caution like you did?” Felicia continued.  “To the eyes of the leadership, you sooner seemed the ill-abled soldier quaking in his boots amongst his calmer counterparts.”</p><p class="calibre10">‘My eyes included,’ she seemed to imply.</p><p class="calibre10">“Please pardon my indiscretion,” I apologised.</p><p class="calibre10">“And by your words, you would ‘exhaust any and all faculties’ for this operation&mdash;what exactly are these ‘faculties’, Brother?  What is it that can you do for us?”</p><p class="calibre10">“All that I am able, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Polishing armour, pulling horses, you mean?”</p><p class="calibre10">“If such be my charges, then yes.”</p><p class="calibre10">For a moment, Felicia fell silent upon hearing those words, her fair face besmirched with bitterness.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Why are you like this…?” she whispered to herself.  “…Would you were more of yourself back then…”</p><p class="calibre10">With pursed lips and downcast eyes, Felicia then parted my presence.  Certainly to her, my state of affairs was a grave betrayal, and nothing else.</p><p class="calibre10">“Awfully sorry to see you so scorned, my sweet swain,” came Sheila.  “So steeped in sin be he the man ungraced&mdash;why, your very presence inspires naught but disappointment in those about you.  Even in ones you hold dear and close.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes.  Sadly so.”</p><p class="calibre10">Sheila Larsen&mdash;an unassuming smile bent her lips.  The very image of a saint.  And befitting of it was her sympathy, which, despite her words, was genuine by any estimation.</p><p class="calibre10">Or rather, “pity” might seem more the word: pity for the poor man yet unwilling to accept his lot as an unloved and unwanted lamb of Yoná.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yet one scarcely needs any odyl to make battle with the behemót, no?  After all, there are amongst the beastly vermin those that may be slain with but swords and spears,” Sheila explained.  “Even a man like you may serve this purpose well enough.  I wonder why you did not think to remind your dear sister of such?”</p><p class="calibre10">“It bears no thought&mdash;I won’t be joining the battle.”</p><p class="calibre10">Soft laughter sang.</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Won’t be joining’?  My poor swain, so deep in your own deception.  A little bit of honesty goes a long way, you know?  ‘I’m not allowed to join’&mdash;now that sorts more squarely with your heart, would you not say?”</p><p class="calibre10">A piercing reproval, rendered with both refinement and a jarring gentleness.</p><p class="calibre10">“Then I’ve misspoken.  Pardon me, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">“O Yoná, Deiva Most Divine…  Had She not disowned you so, what manner of man would you have made of yourself, I wonder?” she prodded on.</p><p class="calibre10">“What man could ever know the manner of ends he’s been denied?  For my part, I’ve given mine not a thought.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Really now?  You have not dreamed of all that could have been your due?  A beautiful wife, an adorable and loving sister, a vaunted career as a knight most valiant, an entire barony to call your own&mdash;so many fancies to fill your many whiles.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yet fill them, I haven’t.  Not once.”</p><p class="calibre10">Pondering upon paths untrodden.  Dreaming of the destinations they wend their ways unto.</p><p class="calibre10">What folly.</p><p class="calibre10">If a man has the time for such idle indulgence, he had best put them to better use for his own future.  Say, like swinging a sword.</p><p class="calibre10">“My, how dimmed you are,” she sighed.</p><p class="calibre10">“Dimmed?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Indeed.  Almost as if… as if your human light is all but snuffed out.”</p><p class="calibre10">Nothing more was said from the surgien as she walked away.</p><p class="calibre10">I very well thought myself to be quite the model human&mdash;more so than any other, no less.</p><p class="calibre10">Immured in such introspection, I stood there, looking on as Sheila’s parting figure disappeared from view.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">“Next: 15th Squad!  Commence entry!”</p><p class="calibre10">Late afternoon.</p><p class="calibre10">We had erected a command post by the mouth of the adit leading into the mines, and it was from there that Emilie dictated the operation.  By her orders were squads sequentially sent down into the haunted depths&mdash;groups composed of an assortment of knights from the disparate brigades, namely of the infantry, sorcery, and support.</p><p class="calibre10">“2nd Squad, reporting!  Five droll-hounds slain, madame!  No damage or casualties incurred!”</p><p class="calibre10">Already were the first-sent squads making their way back to the surface, having completed their twofold charges of setting up minelights and exterminating the behemót lurking along their assigned routes.  By all accounts, the operation was advancing smoothly.</p><p class="calibre10">“Have the 16th Squad made ready?” Emilie asked.</p><p class="calibre10">““They have, madame.  Brigadier Buckmann and the rest are poised to deploy,” answered an officer.</p><p class="calibre10">“Have them standby at the adit.  They’ve twenty minutes till entry.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Right away, madame!”</p><p class="calibre10">A veritable river of orders streamed on and on.</p><p class="calibre10">Brigadier Buckmann&mdash;that would be Felicia.  The next squad to infiltrate the mine would do so under her command.  The squads were by no means large hosts in and of themselves, and so to facilitate their dampened firepower, a number of executive officers were personally joining the fold.</p><p class="calibre10">“3rd Squad, reporting!  We’ve slain one lockbird, three droll-hounds, and four zlatorogs!  Reporting one light casualty!  Equipment damage is minimal!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Very well.  Have the injured’s gear checked again,” ordered Emilie.  Echoes of the report reached the ears of the leadership stationed at the command post.  A stir then simmered amongst them.</p><p class="calibre10">“Lockbirds’ve shown their ugly faces, eh?” one of them muttered.</p><p class="calibre10">“So it’s true what they say.  Godrika’s no walk in the park,” another commented.</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Tis quite the sparse park, by my measure.  Not as many of the damned critters inside as I’d thought,” a third observed, with whom I found agreement with.  The behemót were not as teeming as expected&mdash;unnaturally so.</p><p class="calibre10">Could my prior predictions have come true?  That a monstrosity had made its way into the mines?  That by the beast’s menace the other behemót had been culled?</p><p class="calibre10">Such worries and more wormed about in my mind.</p><p class="calibre10">“The 16th Squad is next.  Deploy them at once,” came Emilie’s next order.</p><p class="calibre10">“Aye, madame!”</p><p class="calibre10">“5th Squad, reporting!  We’ve slain three jaculi and two acid-lizards!  One light casualty reported!  Minimal damage to equipment!”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie paused.  “The <i class="calibre3">5th?</i> What of the 4th?  Have they not returned?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Not as of yet, madame!”</p><p class="calibre10">“…Understood.”</p><p class="calibre10">An ill report.  It would seem the operation’s weave had begun to fray.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">“Mareschal!  The 14th Squad has returned!” came another report.</p><p class="calibre10">“Where’s the 12th?  And the 13th for that matter?” Emilie asked.</p><p class="calibre10">“No word yet, madame!”</p><p class="calibre10">An embittered shade washed over Emilie’s face.  By now, no less than six whole squads were absent in their return.  An “unforeseen contingency” this was, if there ever was one.</p><p class="calibre10">“My Lady Mareschal, if I may…” approached an executive officer, with a voice quiet in its worry.  A well-warranted bout of concern.  Any seasoned officer would be stricken with the same unease, knowing his comrades have yet to show their faces from the depths of those infested tunnels.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie had scarcely opened her lips before shouts filled the air&mdash;abrupt activity bristled amongst those gathered at the adit, who had been worriedly awaiting the absent squads’ return.  Perhaps their patience was rewarded?  Yet their shouts had nary a jump of joy in them.</p><p class="calibre10">At once, Emilie rose from the war-table and made her brisk way towards the adit.  I followed close behind.</p><p class="calibre10">“What’s happened?” she inquired upon arrival.</p><p class="calibre10">“M-Mareschal!  The 15th Squad, they’ve… they’ve returned,” came a hesitant reply.</p><p class="calibre10">Indeed, ‘they’ve returned’ was hardly appropriate, for the squad that emerged from the tunnel was composed of but a single, shambling man.  An arm of his was pressed unusually flat, broken and bent beyond its every joint.  Grating wheezes escaped his blood-spewing mouth, his lungs desperate for air.</p><p class="calibre10">“Have him up on a stretcher!  Bring him to the tents!  Medics, hurry!”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie’s orders, livid and lamenting roars as they were, filled the mountain sky.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">Within the largest pavilion available, a camp bed was unfurled and formed, upon which the injured knight was gingerly laid.</p><p class="calibre10">Treatments, both manual and magickal, were given to him, and by their effects did he somehow recover enough to be able to speak coherently.  As a rule, those treatments should have continued till his condition had stabilised, but this was a grave emergency&mdash;we had to know what happened in those tunnels, and this poor soldier was the sole soul that could tell the tale.</p><p class="calibre10">The forgathered leadership looked on, each and every one of their faces curdled with consternation.  They all knew&mdash;from the man’s mouth would come no merry report.  Indeed, his first words were none sought by any of their ears.</p><p class="calibre10">“…’Twas a greathorn.  A <i class="calibre3">greathorn…!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">A pother boiled up from amongst the shocked leadership.</p><p class="calibre10">The greathorn&mdash;a behemá in the likeness of a bull, burgeoned in its looming bulk, for the combined heights of two full-grown men cannot not hope to peek over its hulking withers.</p><p class="calibre10">Its tempestuous temperament fuels the sheer violence of its assaults: a single charge from this monster is enough to send many a body flying like mere shreds of paper tossed to the wind.  And as per its namesake, from its head protrudes ponderous horns: dread spikes fraught with odyl, hardened to such excess that they would scarcely suffer a scratch in goring straight through a soldier, bones and armour all.  And of defences, the greathorn is not lacking in the least, with a hide nigh impervious to extreme heat and cold both.</p><p class="calibre10">But like a betrayal to its erstwhile form, this bovine beast feasts not on flora, but flesh&mdash;that of men and behemót alike.</p><p class="calibre10">“Fates be fickle…  What’s a devil like that doing down there?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Its kin are like to loiter ‘bout the mountainsides, no?  Perhaps it beds in the tunnels&mdash;nay.  What if it’s turned the tunnels into its own feeding trough?”</p><p class="calibre10">“No wonder the scouts hadn’t spotted it, then.  We are come to seek silver but unearthed madness instead.  What foul luck…”</p><p class="calibre10">At wit’s end, the leaders grumbled and groaned.  The returned soldier, for his part, stared distantly at the ceiling.</p><p class="calibre10">“…The 4th Squad… and 6th…” he resumed reporting.  “We found ‘em dead&mdash;all massacred… so we thought to surface, but there…  There, we crossed the greathorn’s path…”</p><p class="calibre10">As his words went on, the marred man’s face furrowed and furrowed still.  It was most apparent to any lookers-on that his most woeful wounds were the memories flashing before his eyes.</p><p class="calibre10">“So we retreated… quick as we could, but we… we weren’t the only ones, y’see…” he continued on, gasping here and there.  “Four other squads&mdash;oh, bless ‘em…!  All crammed and crazed in that gangway, riled in their own retreat…  But then… the greathorn… ploughed through ‘em all…”</p><p class="calibre10">Sat by the camp bed, Emilie gave me a glance.  The irony of the report was not lost upon her.</p><p class="calibre10">But what a hell it must have been for the poor souls.</p><p class="calibre10">Godrika’s tunnels are overall generous in their width, enough to easily host the wicked wendings of a three passūs-tall greathorn.  Yet the same can hardly be said of hosting large numbers of men.  To be trapped in those gangways in the midst of a toppled and tumbling stampede, only to be trampled flat by a beast so vast and vicious&mdash;surely, it was no less than a living nightmare.</p><p class="calibre10">“We packed our arses and ran… and somehow made it to sector three, in the southern quadrant…  There was a… an abandoned stope that we came into.  By then, only a few of us remained… but our luck dried up.  The greathorn&mdash;’twasn’t far behind…”</p><p class="calibre10">His voice now quaked piteously.</p><p class="calibre10">“I was clinging to my greatshield… hadn’t let go of it once the entire way.  I raised it… to save my soul from that monster’s charge… but I was… bashed and blown away, shield and all…  That beat me up real proper, it did.  And then… and then I ran away… and made it back up somehow…”</p><p class="calibre10">A true trauma, to be so overcome by fright and powerlessness, even now in safety.  It was bad form for a man of the military to utter such frail words as “run away” in lieu of more palatable euphemisms as “retreat” or “withdrawal”, but who could blame him?  Emilie certainly did not.</p><p class="calibre10">“You did well to come back to us,” she said softly.  “Now are we enlightened to the situation, and we’ve you to thank, brave sir.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Mareschal… forgive me… please!” the man pleaded, lips atremble.  “I’ve lost my comrades all…  And my sword and shield&mdash;I threw them down… and ran like a dog…  Oh!  My shield… my poor shield…  Saved me at the Erbelde, the dear thing did…”</p><p class="calibre10">“That I’m sorry to hear.  It well-warded off the Nafílim arrows, but ‘twas an ill-match for the greathorn.  Yet it has saved you once again, for you are alive before us all,” Emilie quietly consoled the soldier, her hand caressing his quivering cheek.  Whimpers welled up from his throat, and it wasn’t long before he began to weep brokenly.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie then rose to her feet and turned to the other leaders.</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m going in.”</p><p class="calibre10">Confusion coursed across their faces.  “Mareschal!?  Y-you musn’t!”  A most appropriate reaction.</p><p class="calibre10">“The greathorn’s hide yields to my levinblade.  I’ll have it laid low myself,” Emilie swore.  “The situation is ill-resolved by our original plans.  And as long as it remains so, we’ve no other choice than to strike down the beast with our mightiest swords.”</p><p class="calibre10">The leadership did all but wince in the face of their mareschal’s resolve.  Yet what lurked beneath the moxie of her words were shades of shame and regret.</p><p class="calibre10">Several squads, each sharing the same path of retreat.  When the dreadful time comes that they would all withdraw, wild in their despair against a terrible and  unforeseen threat, they would surely find themselves tangled and tumbling over each other in those tunnels&mdash;possibilities that I clearly apprised Emilie of on the eve of the operation.</p><p class="calibre10">But her ears were deaf to my warnings, and the price for such pride was paid by her men with what else but their own lives, if not grievous scars upon their flesh and bones.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie’s heart.</p><p class="calibre10">What a storm must be surging within it right now.</p><p class="calibre10">Never was she the sort to so easily accept a dreadful truth as that of droves dying by her own judgement.  But she was a mareschal now, a commander of no small renown, and she must answer the situation at hand&mdash;there was no time to wallow in her woes.  Plans were needed.  Responsibilities had to be assumed.  The chaos must be cut through with some semblance of control.</p><p class="calibre10">Thus did she decide to wrangle the plight with her own hands.  But it was a decision perhaps also founded upon another exigency: the nagging need to punish herself for this dear failure.</p><p class="calibre10">“Gerd, Raakel, and Sheila shall accompany me!  My swain as well!” Emilie announced emphatically.  “Under-Mareschal, you shall remain here and take command in my stead!  If we do not resurface in quarter-day’s time, then take us for dead and return to headquarters immediately.  And there, assemble a commission for inquiry into this incident.  Any questions?”</p><p class="calibre10">The visibly petrified leadership gave their consent with all but their stunned silence.</p><p class="calibre10">“Mareschal,” I called out to her, to which she nodded and looked back at the injured soldier.</p><p class="calibre10">“My good sir.  By your precious words, the 4th and 6th Squads were wiped out, yes?” Emilie asked him.  “What of the other four?  The ones killed in their retreat.  Do you know of their assignments?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Madame… they were the 9th and 10th Squads… and the 12th and 13th, as well,” he answered with much difficulty.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie turned about and nodded to me once more.</p><p class="calibre10">Each and every departed soul of each and every one of the six total massacred squads&mdash;all of them had family and loved ones, to be sure.  And none amongst those left behind would welcome the news, whether true or erroneous.  Emilie and myself, included.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet I kept a candle lit by the window sill of my darkened heart.</p><p class="calibre10">Of the ruined squads named, the 16th went unmentioned.</p><p class="calibre10">There was still one dear hope.</p><p class="calibre10">Somewhere, down in those tunnels, she was still there&mdash;my sister, Felicia.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">Down through the depths of Godrika we wended.</p><p class="calibre10">The widths of the tunnels varied here and there, though not a soul may doubt their overall generosity: about four passūs was the girth of the gangway we were passing through at present.  But the situation would devolve to our great despair were we to face the greathorn here, for little around us availed any means of cover or escape.</p><p class="calibre10">However, the tunnel network itself was dotted through with a number of hollowed-out rooms: “stopes” from which ore had been extracted.  If a battle were to break out, we should best bring the brunt of the chaos to any one of such spaces.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Tch…”</i> A click from Raakel’s tongue echoed through the dark.  As the vanguard of our group, she stood up ahead, halted and vexed.  The focus of her attention fell upon the rows of bodies strewn through the gallery&mdash;knights, silent in their eternal sleep.</p><p class="calibre10">Thus did we find ourselves in the infamous tunnel: four entire squads, frantic as they funnelled into this bottleneck, only to tumble upon each other and make themselves ready for their own slaughter.</p><p class="calibre10">One body was so bent at its spine that the back of its head met with the back of its heels.  Another was disembowelled, the guts gruesomely agape.  None of them escaped a cruel end&mdash;they were all of them run over and crushed in some way.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie bit at her lip.  To be presented with her stilled subordinates, dead in their duty so assigned by her command, all but stole the words out of her.  It was her fists that spoke instead, clenched white as they were, and quivering.</p><p class="calibre10">“I do find it rather curious that a greathorn would make its way into the tunnels so,” Sheila thought aloud.  “Why now, I wonder?”</p><p class="calibre10">“No need to wonder.  One of the leaders said it; didn’t you hear, Sheila?  Turned the tunnels into its very own feeding grounds, the bloody beast did,” Gerd reminded her.  “I suppose it hit the mark, though.  These driftways were as larders stocked full with fodder, whether fresh or foetid.”</p><p class="calibre10">Fodder indeed.</p><p class="calibre10">These mines had once bristled so bountifully with behemót that no man dared to venture into its vicinity.  But to the greathorn, Godrika was a dinner platter piled high with all sorts of palatables, and it was not just behemót that composed its endless meal.</p><p class="calibre10">“And we very well find our names writ large on the menu,” I observed.</p><p class="calibre10">“Quit that yapping, will you, ungraced?  Any half-pated spelunker can figure that out, what from the look of this bloody place.  See here?” Gerd snapped, flicking his chin up at one of the corpses.   The sight earned a shake of his head.  “The bloke’s stomach’s all eaten off.  Yoná, Almighty…”</p><p class="calibre10">“By gum…” Raakel seethed.  “Grass be what a cow gobbles, not… not <i class="calibre3">this.”</i></p><p class="calibre10">“Miss Raakel.  Need we remind you?  It is not the work of a cow we witness here, but a behemá’s,” Sheila pointed out, and as if her words were as a signal, there flickered in the dark ahead of us a series of flashes&mdash;illumination of the magicked sort.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Tonitrus!  Someone’s incanted a Tonitrus!” Emilie broke her silence.  “There’s a battle up yonder&mdash;we must hurry!”  And at once, we all rushed deeper into the tunnel.</p><p class="calibre10">It’s all right.</p><p class="calibre10">Felicia’s all right.</p><p class="calibre10">She has to be.</p><p class="calibre10">She’s strong, after all; the brigadier to our sorcerers, no less.  A greathorn should hardly be a match for her.</p><p class="calibre10">Such faint wishes whispered in my head as I sprinted down the dark corridor.  It wasn’t long before we all emerged into an open space, only somewhat wide in its total area.</p><p class="calibre10">And there she was.</p><p class="calibre10">My sister, standing before a towering, heaving, bull-like behemá.</p><p class="calibre10">Dwarfed by the beast, Felicia breathed laboriously, her staff trained forth at her opponent.</p><p class="calibre10">Blood&mdash;there was deep red upon her person, all in a great stain across her chest, clotted and terrible.  And upon her face was pure despair.</p><p class="calibre10">One of her knees gave out.  Down she collapsed, perhaps having spent her spirit overmuch in the course of the long struggle.  Seeing this, the mad beast became but a blur, charging straight into her.</p><p class="calibre10">“Felicia!!” I screamed, breaking into a dash.  At once, I took her into my arms and lunged forth, missing the behemá’s hewing horn by a hair’s width as it skimmed across my calves.</p><p class="calibre10">“Brother!?” Felicia gasped.  It was then that sharp cackles stung the air and drummed tangibly against my ears.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">She bent down low, her silverblade drawn and shrouded in shrieking electricity.  Then, like an arrow, she bolted straight at the greathorn, meeting it face-to-face.</p><p class="calibre10">My face twisted at the sight.  “Emilie!  No!”</p><p class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre7">“Ferum Fulgur!!”</strong></p>

<div class="calibre6"><figure><div class="calibre6"><img src="https://lightnovelstranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sskvol1illus07.png" alt="" height="500" width="350" /></div></figure></div>

<p class="calibre10">The warning did little to halt her assault: a wide slash of the sword, like a horizon of lightning, pealed across the beast’s body.  With her mark struck, sparks crackled and forked in great flashes through the subterranean air.</p><p class="calibre10">Behind that blinding veil of light, the greathorn loomed…</p><p class="calibre10">…unscathed.</p><p class="calibre10">“How…!?”  Emilie muttered in a gasp, a moment of surprise presented before a beast much fain to seize it.</p><p class="calibre10">And so it did.</p><p class="calibre10">The demonic bull heaved its deadly weight unto a wide-eyed Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre7">“Radiāns Aulaeum!”</strong> chimed Sheila’s voice, and there welled up before Emilie a pall of light, into which the beast’s lethal horns crashed.  For but an instant, the attack was stopped, but it was all that Emilie needed.  Her wits recovered, she darted away, with Sheila’s shining shield shattering into nothingness in that same moment.</p><p class="calibre10">“Wh… what’s this!?” Emilie doubted aloud as she renewed her stance.  “No greathorn should resist lightning!  And my sword&mdash;’tis left nary a scratch on the beast!”</p><p class="calibre10">Of course not.</p><p class="calibre10">It was natural that nothing in Emilie’s arsenal could harm the beast before us, whether it be strikes of sharp silver or lightning.</p><p class="calibre10">“Lady Emilie!  That’s no greathorn&mdash;we face a <i class="calibre3">catoblepas!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">“…Wha?”</p><p class="calibre10">My words warped the others’ faces with immediate dread.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Aoouhhrraahh!!”</i> balefully bellowed the behemá, before charging straight at both Felicia and me.  At once, I leapt out of the way with my sister still in my arms.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Eagh!”</i> I cried.  My shoulder tore open&mdash;the bull’s gnashing horn had met its mark.</p><p class="calibre10">“B-Brother!” wailed Felicia.</p><p class="calibre10">“Everyone!  Over here!” Emilie shouted from a ways off, pointing behind herself.  “We descend below!  Hurry!”</p><p class="calibre10">The tunnel system also splayed vertically into several levels; where Emilie indicated was an incline shaft sinking almost fourteen passūs down, about the height of a five-storey building.</p><p class="calibre10">Nay.  With a drastic slope like that, a “winze” seemed more the word: a steep, vertical passage connecting disparate tunnels, like an underground cliff.  I let Felicia off, and together we ran to it.</p><p class="calibre10">“Bloody hell!  Here goes!” Gerd winced, sliding down the precarious drop with the rest of us not far behind.</p><p class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre7">“Dēfendēns Spīritus!”</strong> came another incantation from Sheila.</p><p class="calibre10">A wall of winds, meant to deflect incoming arrows and like projectiles, awoke and whirled upon our landing spot.  Yet it was oriented in reverse&mdash;right before our feet could crash into the ground, the gales billowed and cushioned our fall.  A safe landing&mdash;the deft work of a dame, exceptional in her practice of succouring magicks.</p><p class="calibre10">Looking up, we found the catoblepas looming over the edge of the winze.  It returned a gaze of its own, its eyes veritably ablaze with a fell light.  It would seem it held no delusions of peace between us.</p><p class="calibre10">“Ye cow-faced guffer!  Gawp down on us, do ye!?” roared our red-haired warrior.</p><p class="calibre10">“Tame your taunting, Raakel,” Emilie appeased.  “Sheila, pray see to Felicia’s wounds.  Rolf’s shoulder, as well.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Of course,” our surgien obeyed, before turning to my sister.  “Miss Felicia, where are you hurt?”</p><p class="calibre10">“My rib… it may be broken,” Felicia answered.  “I’m bleeding as well, but not very much.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I wouldn’t call the stains on your bosom ‘not very much’, Brigadier Buckmann,” Gerd observed.  “Might we know what’s happened?”</p><p class="calibre10">My sister’s gaze fell at once, her spirit lost.  “…This blood… is not my own&mdash;’tis my officers’.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Officers?” Emilie blinked.  “Felicia.  What’s happened to the 16th?”</p><p class="calibre10">“My squad… I… I’m the only one that’s left…”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie’s shoulders sank.  “I see…  The terror.  It must’ve been dreadful,” she quietly condoled.  Her eyes then went to me.  “Rolf.  This catoblepas&mdash;are you certain?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I am,” I nodded.  “It well-pretends the greathorn, but the hue of its hide and the shape of its horns betray its true nature.”</p><p class="calibre10">Like the greathorn, the catoblepas is a bull-like behemá, but unlike the former, it is further classed amongst the <i class="calibre3">mythoferae:</i> creatures more at home in legends than in the living world.  The dread bull brims with odyl at every bend and span of its body, affording it great protection against nearly every known elemental magick.  And its azure-night hide is as a skin of iron, rejecting the bite of any blade sent against it.</p><p class="calibre10">And nothing stops its sundering charge.  What such violence leaves in its wake are piles of the dead, men and behemót alike.  Filed away in the knightly records are reports of but a single catoblepas felling an entire fortress, manned by no less than members of the Order itself.</p><p class="calibre10">Make no mistake: the greathorn pales in comparison to the catoblepas, and we now had the misfortune of being the mark of such a monster.</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie, we must act,” Gerd pressed, and the answer he received was immediate.</p><p class="calibre10">“That we shall.  But by Rolf’s ken, ‘tis not a greathorn we grapple with.  And if so, we’re in dire need of another plan.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie, if I may,” Felicia spoke up.  “What if we were to seal off the tunnels?  That way we may starve the beast to its death, should we wait long enough.”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie then turned to the rest of us.  “Everyone.  What think you all?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’d rather we bray its brains in, if I’m honest,” Raakel shrugged.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yet these tunnels make an ill host for such a pitched battle, I think.  That behemá holds too great an advantage,” Sheila reasoned whilst weaving her mending magicks.  “I see much merit in Miss Felicia’s idea.  Time may yet be our keenest weapon here.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Time?” Gerd cocked his head.  “And how many swings this of ‘weapon’ need we endeavour till that bloody bovine bites the dust, eh?”</p><p class="calibre10">He’s right.  A siege against a host of men this will not be; such a beast can make a fast ally out of time itself.</p><p class="calibre10">“The catoblepas&mdash;it is ranked highly as a mythofera,” I began explaining.  “Accounting for all the odyl it has built up in that body, I’d say it can last several months, at least.  And if the fates have fed it well, perhaps a year and more.”</p><p class="calibre10">That option’s off the table, then…” Emilie relented.  Maintaining a seal upon the mines would require personnel, but with every coin in the operation’s coffers already reserved for some purpose, a siege&mdash;months-long at minimum&mdash;was a failure in feasibility.  “In any case, we’ve succeeded in securing our sole survivor.  ‘Tis best we withdraw for the time being.  Sheila, how fares Felicia?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Well enough.  The mending is finished,” the surgien confirmed.  “Miss Felicia, are you yet in pain?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay.  I can move now, I think.  Thank you.”</p><p class="calibre10">It bears another mention here that the mending magicks are generally tasked to closing wounds, stopping blood loss, and recovering a measure of spent stamina, for that is the usual extent of their effects.  But to repair bones, like those of Felicia’s broken ribs, in so short a span of time spoke volumes of what an extraordinary healer Sheila was.</p><p class="calibre10">“Pray see to Rolf’s wound as well, Sheila, if you can,” Emilie requested.</p><p class="calibre10">I shook my head.  “Nay, Mareschal.  We’ve no time.  Let us quit the place before the beast finds us again.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Bugger, the thing’s gone off!” Raakel groaned as she squinted at the winze edge above.  “It be comin’ after us, ye think?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’ve no doubt,” I confirmed.  “The catoblepas is a creature whose spite is as keen as its horns.  I’ve read reports of a platoon charged with slaying one of its kin.  They were routed and thought to retreat&mdash;only, the beast had other ideas.  For the next three days and nights, it pursued those men.  And now we share in their ill predicament; we’d best assume it’s hot on our tails.”</p><p class="calibre10">My words were unwelcome news to all that heard them, for their faces now furrowed with fear.  A winding detour to the adit awaited us from the lower levels where we now found ourselves in.  With such a long trip ahead of us, it wouldn’t betray reason to assume that the catoblepas would catch up to us at some point.</p><p class="calibre10">“Right then.  Let’s be off,” commanded Emilie, and at once, we were on our way.</p><p class="calibre10">What foul fortune.</p><p class="calibre10">I should have realised long before.</p><p class="calibre10">To point, it is outlandish to think that a greathorn could mow down four whole squads with such frightening ease.  And furthermore, the thought hadn’t even occurred to me that there existed some possibility that our menace might not have been the greathorn it ought to be.</p><p class="calibre10">My mind turned to the battle at the Erbelde.</p><p class="calibre10">It was only after the river began swelling that I realised some diablerie was at work upon the tributary.  Nevermind the fact that the tributary itself was clearly drawn upon a map, so splayed out for us all to see during the war council on the night before.</p><p class="calibre10">Am I at fault?  Or is it conceited overmuch to even think that I have some say in all of this, mere swain that I am?</p><p class="calibre10">Nay.</p><p class="calibre10">That’s not it.  Not at all.</p><p class="calibre10">I am a party to this operation, an actor within this woeful play.  And so long that I am, I share in the responsibility of noticing such fatal details.</p><p class="calibre10">The moment my myriad counsels were unheeded by Emilie was the moment I had given up&mdash;the moment I convinced myself that my duty was all but done.  I deceived myself, dusting off my hands and thinking that the rest should be shouldered by Emilie, mareschal of the 5th as she was.</p><p class="calibre10">How mistaken I was.</p><p class="calibre10">I would do ‘all that I am able’&mdash;were those not my words?  Spoken so resolutely to my sister after the war council?</p><p class="calibre10">Racked by such thoughts, my eyes turned themselves to Felicia, who, noticing me, parted her lips.</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh, B-Brother… I…” she stammered softly.  My brows raised quizzically at her.  “Th-thank you… for saving me earlier.”</p><p class="calibre10">My eyes went back to the way ahead.</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay.  Let it not trouble you,” I returned, “Lady Felicia.”</p><p class="calibre10">She pressed not the exchange any further, falling silent and casting her gaze down sorrowfully.  Emilie, seeing this for herself, couldn’t help but share in my sister’s grief.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">“Bloomin’ ‘eck…  Ye sure we goin’ the good way, m’loves?” fretted Raakel.  “Bugger’d if we get lost, eh?  What with that murder-cow comin’ after us.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Your nagging has got me proper buggered already, Raakel,” Gerd quipped.  “Don’t worry, yeah?  We walk the right path.”</p><p class="calibre10">Briskly did we stride on our winding way to the adit, never knowing when that demon of a bull would burst out of the gloom to gore us from behind.  Raakel’s grumblings were well-grounded: the tunnels were all in a tangle, an unschemed skein that led our return every which way.  By then, we’d both scaled up and slipped down many a layer, and were now closer to ground level than we were upon our first encounter with the catoblepas.</p><p class="calibre10">Only, our worries seemed to have no end in sight…</p><p class="calibre10">“There are stray paths here, ones unmarked upon the map,” I observed while on the move.  “Heed their wiley wendings and we risk going astray with them.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf, you mean to say the maps were mistaken?” Emilie asked.</p><p class="calibre10">“I do.  Lord Gerd said it himself at the war council: the mad rush for silver of forty winters past led to a blind expansion of the tunnel system.  Unfortunately for us, the cartographers’ diligence was no match for the old miners’ zeal.”</p><p class="calibre10">None of the returned squads had reported the presence of such unmarked paths.  Perhaps it was in being so fervent and focused upon finishing their own part of the operation that they failed to pay a mind to any tunnel beyond the route assigned to them.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Haa…”</i> came Sheila’s exasperation.  “The murk of these mines are as the muds of a marsh…  I dearly hope we are well on our way to the exit.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Another worrywart, eh Sheila?  Well, you can hang up your mudboots; we trace the 8th Squad’s footsteps as we speak, and as far as I know, they themselves were untroubled on their way back up to cam&mdash;”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“…Hhrroooohhh…!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">As if to jeer at Gerd’s attempt at consolation, a beastly bellow broke the air from a ways behind us.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Tch!”</i> clucked the eldest Owlcrane.  “Bloody quick for a cow, this catoblepas!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie, up ahead!” Felicia pointed.  “An emptied stope awaits!  Just a bit further!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Right!” our mareschal nodded.  “I suppose that’s where we’ll dance the long waltz, then.”</p><p class="calibre10">With our hearts steeled, we ran further in our course till our emergence into the stope: an expansive cove of burgeoned breadth, greedily gutted of all its ore.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">The six of us were huddled behind cover in that gaping hollow, hastily forming a strategy as per Emilie’s instructions.</p><p class="calibre10">Gerd, Felicia, and Emilie herself were to standby near the mouth of the gangway, from where we were certain the catoblepas would emerge.  Their duty was to dole out a coordinated ambush, one aiming to have the beast buckle down to its hocks and knees.</p><p class="calibre10">Raakel and Sheila, for their part, were to wait a ways off, their charge it was to execute the catoblepas in its collapsed state.  Our warrior readied her maul, with the whole of its head and haft emboldened by our surgien’s succouring magicks.</p><p class="calibre10">“Where our blades fail, we leave it to Raakel,” Emilie chanted.  “Let’s hope you’re fit for the leading part!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Aye, an’ it’ll be a play ye won’t soon ferget!” nodded Raakel.  “All me odyl&mdash;right here in me silvermaul, it is!”</p><p class="calibre10">With that, we all scurried off to our positions and waited with bated breath.  I had the unfortunate pleasure of being positioned in the far rear.  Disappointing, to be sure, but this was not the time to pout; an ungraced would prove to be of small avail here.</p><p class="calibre10">Our ears perked.  From the gangway echoed the catoblepas’ panting, deep and gust-like.  The sound stiffened us all.  Down our cheeks rolled beads of sweat.</p><p class="calibre10">Electricity cracked and snapped about Emilie’s silverblade, while tongues and tendrils of flame seethed about Gerd’s own.  Sheila quietly conjured up another succouring magick, a spell to further bolster Raakel’s sinews.</p><p class="calibre10">The lurid breathing loudened.</p><p class="calibre10">Closer now, and closer still.</p><p class="calibre10">Felicia raised her silverstaff.  Raakel clenched her silvermaul.  Another moment, and the catoblepas trundled its way into the chamber.</p><p class="calibre10">An unnerved soldier might be apt to ambush the beast right this instant, but none amongst us were so foolhardy.  Our patience stayed us all; only till the catoblepas was squarely within the stope proper would we pounce.</p><p class="calibre10">Further.</p><p class="calibre10">Further still.</p><p class="calibre10">Now the baleful bull was wholly in our view.  Then, like a thunderclap, the three sprang to action.</p><p class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre7">“Aciēs Iūnctūrae!”</strong></p><p class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre7">“Annihilandō!”</strong></p><p class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre7">“Glārea Pruīnae!”</strong></p><p class="calibre10">Emilie and Gerd lunged upon the catoblepas’ forelegs, bringing down their ensorcelled blades upon the bulky limbs.  Meanwhile, a frosty pall conjured up by Felicia appeared before the beast, blowing a shrieking gale of sharp ice straight into its face.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Gghhoouuhh!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">A combined offence, executed by some of the mightiest champions in the 5th&mdash;even a monstrosity like a catoblepas could not help but founder before such fury.  But the moment would not go unseized: already was Raakel rushing into the fray.</p><p class="calibre10">“Ey!  Up!!”</p><p class="calibre10">A crack.</p><p class="calibre10">No mortal body should ever produce such a sound.  But produce it did, from where but the beast’s brows as it was struck by a swing of the silvermaul.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ooggh…!”</i> the behemá groaned.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Rruuaaahhh!!”</i> howled Raakel, dissolving into a violent blur of scarlet and silver, her maul thrashing every which way as it rained hammer-strikes upon the catoblepas’ countenance.  The air shattered against the cacophonous cudgelling, unfettered and unrelenting.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Aahhrr…!  Gghoohhou…!”</i> the bull bleated before couching down upon its belly.</p><p class="calibre10">A prime opportunity&mdash;Raakel retracted and raised the savage silvermaul for one more swing, to seal the deal and end the enemy.</p><p class="calibre10">A flicker.</p><p class="calibre10">We saw it, each and every one of us.</p><p class="calibre10">A wicked light roused from the catoblepas’ foul gaze.</p><p class="calibre10">It wasn’t couched in defeat.  No, it was making ready: a low springboard of a stance, from which would follow a deadly charge.</p><p class="calibre10">“Raakel!” shouted Emilie, and just as she did, the catoblepas kicked off.  Such mammoth flesh had no right to move with the speed of a loosed arrow, but the beast betrayed all convention as it thrust its murderous mass straight at Raakel.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Tch!”</i></p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Eah!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Our warrior tore away from the charge in the nick of time.  Felicia jumped out of the way as well, having found herself in the perilous path.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ghhooaaahhrr!!”</i> roared the behemá, unceasing in its advance.  Those lamp-like eyes trained upon a new target: me.</p><p class="calibre10">“Bloody&mdash;!”  I dived to the side to avoid the crazed catoblepas, but with affrighting agility, it wound about and commenced another charge right at me.</p><p class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre7">“Globus Igneus!”</strong> rang Felicia’s incantation, and in the darkened air, there bloomed a billow of flame.  At once, it constricted into a fiery orb and shot straight into the catoblepas mid-charge.  From the ensuing explosion emerged the beast, hindered not in the slightest.</p><p class="calibre10">Its path was unchanged&mdash;it was keen to finish me off.  Perhaps it was wont to wipe its plate clean of any ungraced morsels before moving on to the main course.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Vvhooohhh!”</i></p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ach!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">I ducked out of the way.  It looped and charged once more.  This exchange repeated for but a few seconds of deadly eternity.  At the end of it all, I was cornered.</p><p class="calibre10">Opposite of the gangway leading into this stope was another winze, a veritably gaping gulch leading down to the lower levels.  And there was I, standing at its edge.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf!” screamed Emilie, dashing straight to me.</p><p class="calibre10">But the beast was faster.</p><p class="calibre10">With vaunting vehemence, it smashed its way right into my midst.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Eehhgh!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">An all-consuming impact&mdash;what incredible power.</p><p class="calibre10">Fortunate enough was I to avoid being gored by its horns, but that was where my luck ran out: its rampaging snout struck me squarely.  Such force threatened to snap the very arms I used to defend with, but it instead sent me flying into the sighing shaft.</p><p class="calibre10">But I wasn’t alone.</p><p class="calibre10">The catoblepas, too, parted from the cliff edge, unable to mitigate its own momentum.  Together, man and beast abandoned all footholds and plunged into the deep.</p><p class="calibre10">In that fall, a dear echo met my ears.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Brother…!”</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">My body tumbled through the dark&mdash;</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ahgh!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">&mdash;and slammed against some solid surface.</p><p class="calibre10">Crash and cry both bookended the dive the catoblepas and I took together from the winze edge above.  A trail of dust smoked off of the cliff face, tracing my descent.  I had not flown clear through the air, but like a coiled woodlouse, rolled and skidded instead against the steep rock wall on my way down.</p><p class="calibre10">A fall of almost fourteen passūs, was it?</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Hha… haa…!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">My breathing was in disarray, but I had to get up&mdash;immediately.</p><p class="calibre10">I groped about, finding a wall.  Leaning against it, I laboured my way up to my feet and hastily scanned the environs.  The gaping hole the beast and I fell through&mdash;it was no winze as I had thought it to be, but a vertical stope: a veritable void where once existed an edifice of silver ore.  This hollowed stope continued down further; at its far bottom, there now loomed the catoblepas.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Hhuogh…!  Ghuogh…!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">The blasted bull peered up straight at me, eyes moiling with murder.  It would seem it suffered a longer fall than I had, and ended up on a level lower than mine.  Our staring contest did not last long, however: the catoblepas carried off, likely on a beeline right to where I was.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Rolf…!” came echoes from above.  “…Ro&mdash;lf…!”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie.  She was calling out to me.</p><p class="calibre10">“Em&mdash;<i class="calibre3">khuh…!  Kha-hah…!”</i> My lungs were shook and battered.  Answering back was a firm impossibility; what should have been my voice was but an itching wheeze.</p><p class="calibre10">Not long remained before the demon-bull would find its way to me, and find me it will: it would seem the damned thing thinks of little else once it’s settled on a nemesis, a part I had the ill-starred pleasure of playing.</p><p class="calibre10">I needed a plan.</p><p class="calibre10">Calming my frayed mind as best I could, I gave the surrounding area another look.</p><p class="calibre10">Next to me was a rail cart&mdash;the “surface” I had crashed into earlier, soon after landing.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Khagh!  Ha… haa…”</i></p><p class="calibre10">My breathing had yet to find purchase.  Pain throbbed throughout my body.  I gripped my chest and attempted to rectify my respiration.</p><p class="calibre10">The beast knew the mines well.  Its wits were keenly whetted&mdash;no detours would be taken on its way here.  But how long till it arrived?</p><p class="calibre10">My mind drew up a blank.  Nonetheless, I had to start planning.</p><p class="calibre10">The cart.</p><p class="calibre10">Should I hop in and ride it to safety?  But where to?  Where was it safe, even?</p><p class="calibre10">Fates be damned.  My thoughts were threadbare.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Haah…!  Haa…!”</i> I inhaled loudly and deeply, ignoring the pain erupting from my every pore.  My head was bereft of oxygen, and given the situation, I was fatally obliged to give it all it craved.</p><p class="calibre10">Was there aught around me that could be of some use?  What of the terrain?  Could it avail me in some way?  I had to think of something, anything at all, lest I be gored to pieces by that behemá’s horns.</p><p class="calibre10">A proper look around revealed the level to be quite expansive.  The ceiling was unsupported; all of its stulls were either rotted away or resting in pieces.  Just a ways off were bodies of knights, strewn unceremoniously across the dirt.</p><p class="calibre10">The quieted remnants of the 15th Squad.</p><p class="calibre10">The injured soldier had recounted the last moments with his group thusly: in their retreat from the massacre in the choked gangway, they emerged into an expansive stope&mdash;the third sector, in the southern quadrant.  This was where they encountered the catoblepas, and their final moments with it.</p><p class="calibre10">From the looks of it, three exits led off from this level.  A discrepancy from the map, which had shown only two.  The odd one out was the leftmost gangway.  Near it lay a disused rectilinear object, wooden in construction and half a passus in length, thereabouts.</p><p class="calibre10">A bellows, is it?  Must be.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Haa… haa…”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Busied overmuch was my brain, taxingly processing the myriad pangs of pain sent from every corner of my body.  I wiped the mental table clean of the noise and funnelled as much of my faculties to the situation at hand.  This impasse had to be overcome, and soon.</p><p class="calibre10">I looked down at my feet to glean the immediate terrain.  Where I stood upon was an embankment, which sloped gently down to the wide and level ground below.</p><p class="calibre10">A rail track ran down this very slope, likely once used to carry down loads of ore via some mine carts.  The one next to me was such a contraption, its wheels halted in place by braces on the rail itself.  A lever was nearby.  Pulling it would ostensibly release the braces and let the cart free to run down the slope.  That is, if it weren’t sooner stopped by forty winters worth of rust.</p><p class="calibre10">No.  The rail itself was damaged and decayed at several points.  No doubt the cart would derail if left to run along its course.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ha… haa…”</i></p><p class="calibre10">I attempted to settle my lungs once more.</p><p class="calibre10">Tackled by a cantankerous catoblepas, tumbling down a fourteen passūs cliff&mdash;glad indeed was I to yet draw breath.  Wounds were all about my body, ones that might demand immediate medical attention, but in spite of them, I could still move.  I suspected the fates have yet to tire of toying with this fool.</p><p class="calibre10">Faint glimmers about the ground caught my eye.  Silver ore?  Specimens of assorted sizes were scattered all about.  I took one to hand.  Always had I thought silver to be a gaudish affair, but a subtle glitter riddling the coarse ore did give the metal the charm of twinkling stars.</p><p class="calibre10">I saw for myself then why enthusiasts clamoured in droves for such curios.</p><p class="calibre10">Another upon the ground grabbed my attention, this one long and sharply tapered in shape.  Why not stick this into the beast?  Right where it stings the most?  Be done with the damned demon once and for all, let’s say.  Such foolery frolicked in my mind as I took up the serrated stone and slid it inside a breast pocket.</p><p class="calibre10">A sigh left my lips.</p><p class="calibre10">Foolery indeed.  That I was indulging myself in them was proof that my powers of concentration had not yet made their return.  What could this simple stone achieve that an all-out attack from the Owlcranes could not?</p><p class="calibre10">A strategy&mdash;not a stone.  That was what I needed.  One with which to bring down the beast.</p><p class="calibre10">If I were to use these stones, plentiful as they were, certainly there had to be a more cunning employment of them.  I drank another lungful of air, cleared the clutter in my mind, and gave my surroundings one last check.</p><p class="calibre10">Right.</p><p class="calibre10">Having set myself straight, I went to work gathering up the scattered ore and tossing them into the mine cart.  Already was it loaded midway; filling it up to its fullest did not take long.</p><p class="calibre10">I wiped the sweat from my brows.  “Good.  That should do it.”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“…Ghwagh, gwafh…”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Like an unsought answer to my mutterings, down through the room echoed the catoblepas’ heaving breaths.  It was here.  My hand went up and rested on the rail lever.</p><p class="calibre10">“Come on…  A little more.  I’m right here…!”</p><p class="calibre10">My knuckles tightened into a fist about the iron bar.  Sweat seeped from my palm.  My chest drummed and drummed.</p><p class="calibre10">Off in the distance, the hounding hoof-falls found their way into the room.  The beast locked its eyes onto mine.  A strike against the ground&mdash;off it jolted into a charge.</p><p class="calibre10">I pulled the lever.  At once, the ore-engorged cart shrieked down the tracks.</p><p class="calibre10">My mind raced&mdash;if memory serves, a cubic digitus of silver is little more than two dŭellae in weight.</p><p class="calibre10">I glanced at the cart.</p><p class="calibre10">Fifty-five by eighty by forty-five… almost two-hundred thousand cubic digitī: the cart’s total capacity, now heaped with silver ore.  From what I’d espied earlier, the ore here was pure by about a third; Godrika truly is generous.  Now accounting for negative space and the weight of impurities…</p><p class="calibre10">“Nine-thousand lībrae, just about?”</p><p class="calibre10">The heft of the exotic elephant.  Quite the punch.</p><p class="calibre10">But exactly how much of one?  My mental calculations stopped there; not even our arithmeticians have figured out how to run such numbers yet.  But the cart now rolled down the slope with considerable speed; the momentum should add more than thrice its weight to the total.</p><p class="calibre10">Its iron wheels clanked and clattered as it cruised down towards the charging catoblepas.  By now the beast was bounding its way up the embankment straight for me, but the sight of the speeding iron box should surely startle it.</p><p class="calibre10">Nay.</p><p class="calibre10">This fiend was no fool.</p><p class="calibre10">These mines were its home.  It knew the character of these carts, that they cannot run beyond the rails they were set upon.</p><p class="calibre10">And so the beast simply swerved out of the way.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Gwoufh, gwoufhh!”</i> it seemed to jeer at me, its fiery eyes fixed upon mine.</p><p class="calibre10">Seemed?  Not anymore.  The feral mocking was genuine&mdash;the beast absolutely bristled with bedevilled delight, comforted in knowing that victory was in its grasp.</p><p class="calibre10">How curious.</p><p class="calibre10">There truly is no end to the intricacies of behemá behaviour.</p><p class="calibre10">“I see Man’s not the only creature taken with treat-giving!” I taunted, before breaking into a sprint&mdash;right towards the beast.  “You’ve shown me a year’s worth of wonders today, ugliness!  Now here’s a treat of my own!”</p><p class="calibre10">Certainly it would’ve been best had the cart crashed into the catoblepas, but to think that it would was pure naïveté.</p><p class="calibre10">Plan B.</p><p class="calibre10">I knew it would come down to this.  The “buffoon’s plan”, more like, but I had naught else up my sleeve.</p><p class="calibre10">Past the catoblepas, the cart left the slope and levelled on flat ground.  Only, the rail curved immediately from then on, and where it did, the track was already greatly deteriorated.  Met with this sudden turn, the overloaded cart jumped&mdash;</p><p class="calibre10">&mdash;the sound of screaming iron.</p><p class="calibre10">The iron wheels cut through the rusted rounding rails, and further off the cart shot, its elephant-like weight lunging into the rock wall.</p><p class="calibre10">The air boomed.</p><p class="calibre10">The mines bellowed.</p><p class="calibre10">From a memory whispered Emilie’s voice.</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre2"><i class="calibre3">“…that area is ready to collapse at the feather’s touch…”</i></p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">The war council&mdash;her finger hovered over the map.</p><p class="calibre10">Sector three.  Southern quadrant.</p><p class="calibre10">Red ink slashed across it, forbidding all combat within its perimeter.</p><p class="calibre10">Confusion flickered across the catoblepas’ maw and brow as the ground quaked and groaned.  And off to the beast’s side was I, but for only an instant: mustering all might into my legs, I dashed past it, my eyes fixed upon a different destination.</p><p class="calibre10">Its hatred unfaded, the behemá pivoted violently about and attempted to catch me with a swipe of its horns, but in its own eyes rolled the reflection of a greater force: boulders.</p><p class="calibre10">Boulders upon boulders upon boulders.</p><p class="calibre10">Bountiful and ubiquitous, a mountain falling down.</p><p class="calibre10">Stones once composing the very ceiling of this far-reaching room.</p><p class="calibre10">A new cacophony crashed through the cavernous air.</p><p class="calibre10">Rocks rained and rained, fully flooding the entire area.  A great boulder with a girth half that of the catoblepas’ own body dived right into the back of the beast.  But no time was given for its victim to let out so much as a single cry of pain, as the monster was soon immured under a growing mound of stones.</p><p class="calibre10">Unceasing were the quakes and roaring rumbles.  The boulders pelted the scene, each intent upon pressing and pulverising all caught within.  Lifeless objects, mercilessly stamping out all signs of life.</p><p class="calibre10">And their mission of massacre continued on for a while longer yet.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">“Rolf!  Where are you?  Rolf!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Brother!”</p><p class="calibre10">Across the rock-flooded chamber echoed Emilie’s and Felicia’s desperate calls.  From the gangway, the girls emerged into the broken, byzantine scene, with the rest of the Owlcranes cautiously in tow.  Their way was unhindered enough; fortunately, the gangway’s mouth was left unbarred by the cave-in.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf!  Answer us!  Please!”</p><p class="calibre10">Stones pressed against me from all over.  My chest and diaphragm were constricted&mdash;I could not answer the girls’ pleas.  For that, I must first crawl out of this cage of rubble.  Finding myself laying upon my side, I roused my every sinew to push and part away the rocks.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf!” Emilie cried, spotting me as I slid out from my lifesaving canopy: a greatshield.  Dented all over it was, but it well-withstood the pummeling rock-rain.</p><p class="calibre10">“Ey up, muscle-pate!  Ye look the gormless turtle there, eh?  Hidin’ under that greatshield from the rockfall an’ what not.  Jammy ye found it here o’ all places!”</p><p class="calibre10">“It would appear even impious turtles are fit for the mercy of the fates.   Indeed, this day sees their full smiles upon you, my silly swain.  The catoblepas&mdash;it is swallowed.  We have much to be thankful for.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hah!  The cave-in’s the work of his cunning, more like.  Couching beneath the shield like that&mdash;I’ll bat not an eye if that, too, was writ in his schemes.”</p><p class="calibre10">The collective commentaries from the other Owlcranes.  Back on my feet, I caught a glance of Gerd’s displeased demeanour.  But his words had the right of it.</p><p class="calibre10">The sole survivor of the 15th Squad&mdash;by his account, it was in this very stope where he last encountered the catoblepas.  With his greatshield did he survive its lethal charge&mdash;the same shield that had carried him past the hail of arrowfire at the drifts of the Erbelde.  But the brunt of the beast’s attack proved too overwhelming, and it was here that the poor soldier parted with his dear protector.</p><p class="calibre10">Just as he had said, the slab of iron was waiting here all this time.  I had found myself in his same predicament, but with his beloved shield did I defy a hail of a different sort.</p><p class="calibre10">Though, had I found myself under a boulder as enormous as the one squarely suffered by the catoblepas, that certainly would have been the end of me.  That I stood here now, beholding the Owlcranes and my sister, was fortunate proof of the contrary.  Sheila was on the mark: I had the fates to thank.</p><p class="calibre10">But just as I had the thought to do so, the hairs on my nape stood on end.  Electricity ran through my senses&mdash;something, somewhere, wished to kill.</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh, Brother… your wounds.  We must see to the&mdash;”</p><p class="calibre10">“Stay back!”</p><p class="calibre10">My thundering bark stayed Felicia in her approach.  Right after came a rumble.  Off in the distance, boulders rose.</p><p class="calibre10">From under them emerged the beast.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Gwfaah…!  Goufh…!”</i> that bull-demon breathed, heatedly, heavily.  Its eyes twitched across their every corner about before freezing in their seething stareーupon me.</p><p class="calibre10">And only me.</p><p class="calibre10">Nary a mind was paid to the others present, their faces affrighted.  No, the catoblepas freed itself from its live burial and commenced another charge straight at its ungraced enemy.</p><p class="calibre10">Stones flew from the beast’s rampaging path.  I joined them as I dived off to the side.  The escape found me untouched and the behemá beleaguered by both its wounds and the sheer maze of obstacles barring its way&mdash;dulled now were its erstwhile violence and vigour.</p><p class="calibre10">But no advantage was gained: this was a stalemate, through and through.  The other five here were champions of the 5th Order, and neither their combined assault nor a gigantic falling boulder were able to put an end to this beast.  What then, could?</p><p class="calibre10">There was little time.  I searched for an answer.</p><p class="calibre10">Off to the side, a mouth in the wall&mdash;another gangway leading out.  Next to it, the bellows I had noted before.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf!” yelled Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">“All of you, stay away!” I shot back.  “I’m its mark&mdash;no one else!”</p><p class="calibre10">Time for Plan C.</p><p class="calibre10">I bolted off, only to be immediately paralysed by pain now striking my every nerve like lightning.  Perhaps in being flooded in all this agony were the throbs of broken bones drowned out.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Egh!”</i> I winced furrowingly.  No time to tarry and whimper.  Death was coming.</p><p class="calibre10">I forced one foot forward after the other and gained speed down the gangway, all the while sensing behind me the frenzied behemá tearing down the same path.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Gaufh!  Haufh!”</i> it fumed, the beastly breaths searing my back like sirocco winds.  But I pressed on, whipped into a fevered pitch by a primal fear, one of being gruesomely gored from behind.</p><p class="calibre10">Pain nagged away even now, ever so audible in its screams throughout my body.  And so I muffled them from my mind, focusing solely on flying down the darkened tunnel.</p><p class="calibre10">Water&mdash;if there is one dilemma that any and all mining ventures could name, underground water would be the first to be aired.  Strike the wrong rock and the entire minery could be inundated if left unchecked.  To deal with it, bellows are sent in to syphon the water away.</p><p class="calibre10">That one such contraption lay back in the caved-in stope meant that further ahead slept a wellspring.  Or at least, I hoped so.  But if true, then a sizable body of water must have built up in the course of these last four decades.  That would be my next destination, and if the fates remained kind, the catoblepas would be a fool to this fact.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Oufh&mdash;!”</i> I yelped, stopping dead in my tracks.  The gangway terminated&mdash;no more ground lay before me.  There I stood, upon the edge of another cliff.</p><p class="calibre10">Before me sighed a shaft, like a great tower of shadow.  Far down below was its sump, now as an abyss of black waters&mdash;just as I had predicted.  While murky, I could yet glean that it spanned far and deep.  A veritable lake, this was.</p><p class="calibre10">I swivelled around and locked eyes with the beast as it rampaged down the gangway.  Wrath writhed through its every sinew.  The wounded catoblepas, now but a creature bent upon the kill, set its course straight for me.</p><p class="calibre10">Standing firm, I peered through the thick dark to discern the behemá’s features once more.</p><p class="calibre10">The thing was but a mass of muscle and bones.  Clearly an illusion, for how else could blades merely bounce off its hide, and hammers and falling boulders scarcely slow its cruel career?  Nay, it should certainly be a specimen of steel, elephantine and insurmountable.</p><p class="calibre10">And that was precisely why it would not swim.</p><p class="calibre10">Neither could the “hippo”, waterborne critter of the southern lands as it is.  No, any creature, even with lungs of its own, would sink if heavy enough&mdash;the same should hold true for the beast before me.</p><p class="calibre10">“Come…  This race is run, my friend!”</p><p class="calibre10">I tempered my resolve, gulped down all the air my torso would allow, and bent low to readiness.</p><p class="calibre10">The catoblepas and I, how battered and bruised we were.  This would be the last exchange between us, the end of our game of cat-and-mouse.  One final, fierce moment.</p><p class="calibre10">Ten passūs.</p><p class="calibre10">Five passūs.</p><p class="calibre10">One!</p><p class="calibre10">I leapt backwards, right before contact could be made.  My hands rushed up to catch the incoming horns, keeping them from running me through.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Eaagh!”</i> I groaned behind clenched teeth.  My arms trembled against the sheer shock of having absorbed the catoblepas’ charge&mdash;though injured, my foe’s fury fueled the attack plenty enough.  Pain once again rattled my entire body; I felt as though my flesh had begun to unravel at its every seam.</p><p class="calibre10">There we fell once again, together, through the shadowy shaft.  I had avoided death by goring, but now another predicament loomed.</p><p class="calibre10">My back pierced the water.  Thunder slammed against my eardrums.</p><p class="calibre10">Then, all was muffled.</p><p class="calibre10">Behind the curtain of bubbles, man and beast melted into the watery black.</p><p class="calibre10">Within it, our battle was broken.  From the hulking horns were my hands freed.  Confusion arrested my wits, but they found purchase soon enough.  I squinted, scouring the turbid dark for the beast.</p><p class="calibre10">There it was&mdash;right beside me.</p><p class="calibre10">Then, softly, it sank.</p><p class="calibre10">I was right.  The thing could not float.  Not with an ungainly body like that.  Something went right at last.  Relief began to set in.</p><p class="calibre10">But the fates were conspiring.</p><p class="calibre10">Only a fool would fall for relief’s feint upon so cruel a place as a battlefield.  The catoblepas had till now walked through mountains and valleys of corpses of its own making.  Certainly many amongst those dead were taken by the same relief before their own ends.  Delicious opportunities, they must have been.</p><p class="calibre10">And the beast was not about to let another go unseized.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Bwafh…!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Precious air plumed from my mouth.</p><p class="calibre10">Sharp pain erupted from my left ankle.</p><p class="calibre10">Giant teeth were eating into my leg.</p><p class="calibre10">The catoblepas funnelled the last of its strength into its maw, all in a bid to share a grave with its final foe.</p><p class="calibre10">Down.</p><p class="calibre10">Down.</p><p class="calibre10">Down, into the deep I drifted, pulled along by spite incarnate.  But my leg was yet whole&mdash;the beast was soundly spent, its maw firm but mild in its bite.  Were it any other day, just a mere twitch of its jaw would have torn off a man’s limbs like wet paper.</p><p class="calibre10">But that was all well and fine for the beast.</p><p class="calibre10">There was no need to tear aught.  Not anymore.  Pulling me down sufficed.  A piece of paper is just as doomed at the dark bottom of a flooded sump, after all.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">Ye shall savour naught a scrap o’ vict’ry.</i></p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">By my shadow I’ll shut out the sun o’er all your future days, I will.</i></p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">Your days, and only yours.</i></p><p class="calibre10">I spied such thoughts in the beast’s eyes, vindictive ruminations that were as kindling to the conflagrations in its scarlet stare.</p><p class="calibre10">Eyes by whose fell light stabbed the darkness.</p><p class="calibre10">Eyes that craved murder, committed through any and all means.</p><p class="calibre10">Eyes that would shoot horror and hysteria into the faint of heart.</p><p class="calibre10">Eyes portending so much calamity&mdash;</p><p class="calibre10">&mdash;gored through with a shard of ore.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Vfwagh…!?”</i> frothed forth the final breath from the beastly lungs, freeing my leg from the bite of the slacking maw.  The ghostly sun in its eye was shut out by the silvered stone, a souvenir I had availed myself during my dazed planning.</p><p class="calibre10">Thus did the now half-eyed beast drift quietly into the deep.  Yet the other half’s gaze remained unbroken upon me, still and intent.  I stared back, watching as the beast was swallowed up by the abyss.</p><p class="calibre10">The thing had dealt death to droves of our knightly number.  No doubt it was our nemesis.  Yet it was we who had encroached upon its dwelling.  To curse it was foul duplicity and blatant bigotry.</p><p class="calibre10">Nay.  I admired its heart instead.  Curiously so.</p><p class="calibre10">The heart of the defiant, fixed upon the battle at hand, one fought to the end of all ends.  No matter the manner of the moment, that behemá struggled on and on.  With every bone and sinew and thought in its mind and body tasked to the fight, it failed in only one respect: to, at any point, relent before its last moment.</p><p class="calibre10">What look had I upon my face, I wonder?</p><p class="calibre10">The face of an ungraced, a man ever at odds with his fellow men.  A man that has now come to revere not his brethren, but a beast.</p><p class="calibre10">What was the look upon the face of such a man, witnessing that same vaunted creature vanishing beyond the verge of all knowing?</p><p class="calibre10">As if the thought to do so had just occurred to me, I began my swim back up, leaving the lifeless empty below.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">The catoblepas was slain.</p><p class="calibre10">With Godrika free from its menace, the 5th Chivalric Order resumed their efforts to secure the bloodied depths.  The knights’ diligence proved fruitful, for at just past sundown on the second day, the final squad emerged from the adit and gave the bookending report: the tunnels were at last emptied of their erstwhile inhabitants.</p><p class="calibre10">The Godrika Minery was back in Londosius’ hands, and the monolithic veins of silver with it.</p><p class="calibre10">But candles were kept lit, for the work of the knights was yet undone.  Many a time was the hourglass turned till late into the moon-crowned night, where adjourned a meeting on the stationing of troops at the mines, as well as the repatriation of the dead therein.  Yet again were we to camp under the stars; only on the morrow would we make our way back to headquarters.</p><p class="calibre10">Through the miracles of mending magicks were my wounds mostly sealed up, though my bones were left in their broken state.  The silver lining?  I was yet able to walk this time, a thankful convenience compared to the aftermath of Erbelde, where I was left bedridden for days on end.  And so I availed myself the opportunity.</p><p class="calibre10">Sword practice.  The daily rigour.  The daily comfort.</p><p class="calibre10">There was I, alone in a benighted grove.  Hands clasped about the hilt, I turned my eyes up to the moon.  Pain ran through me in an unceasing cycle, but by force of will, I pushed it from my mind.  I raised the sword and swung.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Egh…!”</i> I winced.</p><p class="calibre10">This won’t do.</p><p class="calibre10">The pain was the better opponent, sharp and sudden, leading my sword astray in its sailing.</p><p class="calibre10">“No good…  And no choice, either,” was my muttered relent.</p><p class="calibre10">And so I settled into the centre guard, blade forward.  If I could not swing with my body, then I would swing with my mind.  I emptied my lungs of their air, and purged from my head any remaining distinction between my hands and my blade.</p><p class="calibre10">Now I had but to repeat the same once more, this time between my consciousness and the ambience itself.</p><p class="calibre10">In my mind’s eye, the vision of a swung sword.  Then another.  And another.  Downward.  Upward.  Left.  Right.  Aslant.</p><p class="calibre10">In my corporeal eyes, the sight of a stilled sword.  Moonlit.  Motionless.</p><p class="calibre10">For countless times more, I continued to swing the sword with not a single budge from my body.  Each instance of the blade arc, carefully corrected.  Each swing, imbued with the whole of my soul.</p><p class="calibre10">My brows furrowed.</p><p class="calibre10">Even in my mind, the blade began to meander.</p><p class="calibre10">For there before me, that beast awoke.  A foe never to be forgotten.  The memory of the mines surfacing into the moment.  A harrier upon my heart.</p><p class="calibre10">The envisioned sword was swung many times more, but its course proved uncorrectable.  Bent it was in its travel, dull in its cut, slow in its fall.  Tonight would be another wasted night.  The distractions have won the bout.</p><p class="calibre10">I closed my eyes, finding there in my heart the blackened waters stirring once more.</p><p class="calibre10">In its depths, the eyes of the sinking catoblepas&mdash;eyes brimming with the brilliance of battle, bright and burning, till they were as embers stamped out by the cold abyss.</p><p class="calibre10">Those very eyes had shown me what a valley there was between their master and myself.  Of how unconquerable the catoblepas’ spirit was.  Of how dwarfed my defiance was.  I had won the game of life and death, but lost the war of wills.</p><p class="calibre10">‘I am without odyl.  If victory is not in the cards, then I have but to fold.’</p><p class="calibre10">Somewhere, somehow, I had fooled myself into believing such, that this would be the way of things from here on out.  And so I lost, and continued to lose, till the battle came whereupon my very essence was to be judged.</p><p class="calibre10">There, too, I lost.</p><p class="calibre10">The odyl of which I lacked, the world in which I lived&mdash;neither were factors in this fight.  Only my spirit was the participant, and by the end, it was beaten and brought low.</p><p class="calibre10">How pathetic.</p><p class="calibre10">Eyes open, I gave a deep breath.  With renewed determination, I clenched the hilt of my sword.  Back to the beginning now.</p><p class="calibre10">Till there rang a voice I knew very well.</p><p class="calibre10">“Brother.”</p><p class="calibre10">Long has it been since I’ve failed in sensing someone’s approach before their call.  Another defeat&mdash;how many more must I endure before the light of dawn?</p><p class="calibre10">“My Lady Felicia,” I answered.</p><p class="calibre10">A brooding mien shaded her fair face.  “…I am yet your ‘Lady’, now of all times?”</p><p class="calibre10">“As you must be.”</p><p class="calibre10">I knew well what she wanted to say, but breaking custom here would have done neither of us any favours.  This was not simply a matter of paying the requisite respect to a superior.</p><p class="calibre10">No.</p><p class="calibre10">Felicia would gain only grief in consorting with me so congenially, ungraced as I am.</p><p class="calibre10">What’s more, House Buckmann had forbidden even the sharing of words between us.  Were it to fall upon the ears of our parents that she yet harboured any warmth for her wayward brother, then surely a shadow would loom anew upon her future prospects.</p><p class="calibre10">For her part, Felicia must have been well-apprised of this by now.  Yet to her, knowing and accepting were hardly two sides of the same coin.</p><p class="calibre10">Such a troubled soul stared on at me, sullen.</p><p class="calibre10">“If I may ask, what is it that you’ve been doing here?” she said dispiritedly.</p><p class="calibre10">“Training, my Lady,” I returned.  “My daily practice.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yet those hands have hardly swung the sword even once, in all the time that I’ve watched you,” Felicia observed.  “Is it that your wounds have gotten the better of you?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay.  One may yet swing a sword that cannot be swung, as it were.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I… see.  I think…  Were this training only as constructive as it is cryptic.”</p><p class="calibre10">Lost upon my own sister, I see.  I couldn’t blame her.  Not least because our disciplines were worlds apart.</p><p class="calibre10">“Well?  How may I be of service to the Lady Felicia?” I asked, to which my sister began parting her lips for words that would surely issue with no small difficulty.</p><p class="calibre10">“…I… I owe you much and more… for your bravery.”</p><p class="calibre10">For having saved her from the catoblepas, perhaps?  There was a tone of gratitude in her voice, certainly, but I also sensed some regret couched in that timbre.</p><p class="calibre10">“And my words after the war council&mdash;they were bitter overmuch,” she continued.  “‘Twas an undue slight that I’ve let slip.”</p><p class="calibre10">“One I pay not a mind to,” I dismissed.</p><p class="calibre10">“But…”</p><p class="calibre10">“What left your lips was not so out of line.  But be that as it may, some biting words here and there are well and fine, I’d say,” was my admittance.  “We’re family, after all.  You and I.”</p><p class="calibre10">Anew upon Felicia’s lips: a faint smile.  She then let her gaze fall, and there our company sat still for a quiet, moonlit while.  At its end, she looked up again.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Brother…” she softly started, “…you’d slain that behemá all by yourself, hadn’t you?  That affrighting catoblepas… murderer of all our men&mdash;with just you alone was it felled…”</p><p class="calibre10">“I was hardly alone,” I corrected.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yet hardly had I and the others done aught.  ‘Tis certain: we were… we were of no avail…”</p><p class="calibre10">Her voice trailed off to quietude before another joined our midst.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf, Felicia.  You two’ve been here all along, I see.”</p><p class="calibre10">Felicia turned up.  “Emilie…”</p><p class="calibre10">Our young mareschal came into the moonlight.  Her timbre, too, was void of its erstwhile vigour.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Even on a day like this, you won’t rest from your training, Rolf?” Emilie asked flatly.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, Mareschal.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I see…  But do temper yourself.”</p><p class="calibre10">Her regard had the look of complete exhaustion about it.  We had won the day, but only upon the bodies of the vainly departed&mdash;those of none other than her own subordinates.  I could not imagine what a crushing burden it must have been upon her heart.</p><p class="calibre10">“Your counsel, Rolf.  It portended much… hadn’t it?”</p><p class="calibre10">Our point of contention.  Silence was my answer.</p><p class="calibre10">“The behemá menace, the tangled routes of retreat, the casualties…” Emilie resumed.  “Had I heeded your warnings, certainly the day would’ve sung a different tone.”</p><p class="calibre10">“The day is ours regardless,” I reaffirmed dispassionately.</p><p class="calibre10">“…I suppose it is, in the end.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie…” Felicia gently spoke up.  “Are you unwell?”</p><p class="calibre10">The two girls were as sisters to one other.  That Felicia would show such concern for the visibly haggard Emilie was most natural, for between them was shared a sympathy nurtured since their earliest days.</p><p class="calibre10">“Unwell?  I…  Yes.  I <i class="calibre3">am</i> unwell, I admit,” said Emilie.  “Felicia.  Not long ago, I bade your brother seek a different path&mdash;one of strategy and planning, perhaps, things of that sort.  He’s a wise one, as you well know.  And that’s why I thought he’d find some purchase, were he to sheathe the sword for good…”</p><p class="calibre10">“I see…”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yet… ‘twas that same wisdom that I took ill-heed of.  Only yesterday did I reject his counsel outright, and now…”  Emilie shook her head.  “…Now we’ve got graveyards to fill.  Families to condole.”</p><p class="calibre10">“But Emilie, ‘tis not…”</p><p class="calibre10">“You had your reasons,” I asserted.  “And they were valid enough.  To say you rejected my proposals outright is a bit much.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yet the losses we’ve suffered were both unreasonable <i class="calibre3">and</i> overmuch; no excuse or comfort now can bring back all the dearly departed,” Emilie insisted.  Her lips then slowly bent into a smile&mdash;a weary, lightless smile made to mock none other than Emilie herself.  “…When I’d heard the 15th’s report, I couldn’t contain my shame: I had to enter the mines myself and settle the matter with my own hands.  ‘Twas witless of me, looking back on it now…”</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh, Emilie…” Felicia consoled.  “’Twas a greathorn we all thought the beast to be, no?  Were that the case, certainly your levinblade would have felled the fiend.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…You thought to punish yourself, didn’t you?” I elucidated.  “Atonement, tempered by regret&mdash;impetus enough to send yourself into the tunnels, where you might right your wrongs.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes… that sorts well, I must say.  What a fool I was,” Emilie confessed, her eyes drifting off to some memory.  “And the Mareschal Tiselius…  I admit again, I see something of a rival in her.  She often fights on the frontlines, doesn’t she?”</p><p class="calibre10">Estelle Tiselius.  Dame Mareschal to the 1st Chivalric Order.  I had not thought her name would come up in this conversation, but here we were.  Widely reputed for her valour upon the frontlines she was, but I could not comprehend why that would stoke within Emilie the fires of competition.</p><p class="calibre10">“The Mareschal Tiselius is a hero-dame of our realm, that much is certain.  But the Lady Emilie is hardly wanting for merits of her own,” I observed.  “Am I wrong?  I see no reason why you must be compelled to play the rival so.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…You’re right…” Emilie relented, letting her gaze fall.  Yet another matter remained uncertain in her heart, one she brought to voice after much struggle.  “Rolf.  About what you said before, of how our kingdom means to expand its military might, should we take back these mines&mdash;will it come to pass, do you think?  Now that we’ve done just that?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’ve no doubt.”</p><p class="calibre10">Silver.</p><p class="calibre10">Londosius’ dearest fodder for its lions of war.</p><p class="calibre10">Godrika was at last the kingdom’s own, and eager were its royal hands to reach into the purified bowels and snatch up all the silver it so coveted.  And not to the crafting of coins or crowns would the precious metal be tasked.  No, every molten droplet of the argent would fill the moulds in which would form the pride of Londosius: silver weapons and silver armour.  Nothing else.</p><p class="calibre10">And certainly, many wills within the kingdom’s legislative halls were long bent upon seeing this through&mdash;Central, in particular.  Indeed, the administrative canopy over the five Orders was as an aviary aplenty with war hawks, each itching and impatient upon his perch.  Our success here at the mines would doubtlessly see that fiery flock flourish.</p><p class="calibre10">“We’ll be showered with decorations for what we’ve achieved today… won’t we?” Emilie wondered aloud with furrowed brows.</p><p class="calibre10">“Likely.”</p><p class="calibre10">Many souls here were lost.</p><p class="calibre10">And many amongst them again were the dear issue of the aristocracy.  The 5th, after all, is a grand gathering of ennobled sons and daughters all seeking to start their decorated lives.  The implication here cannot be understated.</p><p class="calibre10">But another implication, one of a newfound source of silver&mdash;a seemingly endless supply of it, one could imagine&mdash;is overshadowingly monolithic by comparison.</p><p class="calibre10">Londosius was changed forever.</p><p class="calibre10">An able commander is he who knows best how to kill his own soldiers, that his own ends might be given furtherance.  A cruel and cutting truth, one that undeniably manifested here at the mines, much to Emilie’s chagrin.  But I suspect Central would have fained to agree with frightening immediacy.</p><p class="calibre10">“…My heart tells me to step down as mareschal, that I might answer for my failings,” confided Emilie.  “It’ll hardly atone for all we’ve lost, only… I cannot see myself keeping the mareschal’s mantle for much longer.  Yet… yet stay, I must…”</p><p class="calibre10">Tears fell from the young mareschal’s eyes.</p><p class="calibre10">“House Mernesse… my poor, poor family…  We’re so small, so faint, I fear… I fear we are as a raft upon the fickle seas… ready to founder against the slightest wave…” she wept.  “…This victory&mdash;how I detest it so… yet I <i class="calibre3">need</i> it, if only to keep my family afloat…”</p><p class="calibre10">Mernesse.  A noble line fallen upon hard times.  With but a few servants and no land to call its own, House Mernesse was like to fade as a bubble set loose upon the barbed winds of aristocratic society.  Yet Emilie’s fortunes gave it the purchase it needed to survive.  Though, just the same, its heavy fate now rested solely upon her young shoulders.</p><p class="calibre10">But for her family to persist with any certainty, a further arrangement must be consummated.</p><p class="calibre10">“…And House Albeck…” Emilie continued.  “…If I’m to honour the engagement, then I’ve no choice… none save remain in the Order…”</p><p class="calibre10">House Albeck&mdash;its son and heir to whom Emilie was now betrothed.</p><p class="calibre10">It would seem her station as an elite within the Order gave substance to the engagement.  The shackles of aristocratic life, as it were.  I’ve since been freed from them, for better or worse.  Yet here, Emilie remained indelibly bound by them.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">Never would these worries have harried me had you found the grace of Yoná…</i></p><p class="calibre10">Words that Emilie dared not utter.</p><p class="calibre10">But they spoke the simple truth.  Were we yet betrothed and to be blessed with a happy ever-after, she would not have known the misery that now mired her so.</p><p class="calibre10">On and on, she sobbed.</p><p class="calibre10">Felicia, helpless, did naught but look on to great sorrow.</p><p class="calibre10">The night after a hard-won victory.</p><p class="calibre10">The victors&mdash;not amongst them was shared a single smile.</p>
