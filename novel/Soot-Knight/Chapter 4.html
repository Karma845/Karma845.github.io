<p style="text-indent: 40px">The margrave’s manor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Having found his upper-storey office too stifled, the lord had descended to the great hall where, for an aching while, he paced to and fro.  No other soul was present in the echoing space.  He had sent for certain persons, sure enough, but their arrival was overlate.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Oh, long indeed was the night prior.  Bright beams now breathed through the towering windows, welcoming in the clean and clear mirth of morning.  Yet such sweet air was ill-savoured; the margrave’s mien was most grim, pricked and prodded by impatience.  The reason: his fief-burgh was forayed, his defences <i>defeated.</i>  To this moment were the Nafílim invaders strutting through his streets, and he could do naught but let his city suffer their stains.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Two of his gates to the north were attacked, their defenders failing against the foe’s forces before allowing the latter into Arbel proper.  Two more gates to the east were harried, as well, and though they thankfully held the line, such success served no solace, for doubtless the enemies there would wind about to the north and welcome themselves in.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Nafílim, pressing into Arbel with numbers unanswerable—never had such a nightmare haunted the hills and homes of Ström till this day.  Many generations of the margrave’s line had looked after these lands for the Crown, but now did so enduring a history stand to be hewn, upon whose generation but <i>his.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The margrave stopped, grimacing at the foreboding boiling up from within.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">His own death.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The end of House Ström.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Notions never once a visitor in his thoughts.  But the present found them increasingly palpable, a cruel reality roaring louder and louder at his ears.  Rattled and wroth, the margrave struck his heel against the marble floor.  And as if on cue, a new echo sounded: double doors creaking open, through which then entered the Östberg siblings with Sigmund in tow.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Excellency,” Viola addressed the lord, bowing.  “Your bidding?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Late you are.  And lacking a head…” remarked the margrave, looking suspiciously at his guests.  Verily had he called for the leaders of the Zaharte Battalion to meet him here, though when last he met them, they numbered four.  “That shaven-pate churl—where is he?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Ulrik recuperates in the infirmary,” answered Viola.  “An ill-turn he took.  But not to worry; he plainly hungers for the soonest return to the fray.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And this fellow of yours, too, tumbled down the same turn, I take it?” the margrave pointed out, scowling at Sigmund.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Tch…”</i> clucked the swordsman’s tongue.  On his cheek was pasted a cloth poultice, concealing a blade-wound.  Hardly aught unmendable by magicks, but for whatever reason, he had chosen instead to eschew the enchanted treatment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The margrave sucked his teeth.  “&#8230;I suffer your boorish brood that you might serve a beacon in this darkest of hours.  ‘Bid us battle and boons be upon you.’  Whose words were those, hm?  <i>Whose?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lines of lividness, but delivered without dynamism; it would seem the margrave was weary and well at the end of his wits.  Viola cast her eyes down discerningly and offered an unresistant answer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Ours, Excellency.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Her own disappointment cut no less deep.  In hopes of completely crushing the main enemy force had she deployed Ulrik and Sigmund to the northern front.  But having met their seeming match, those very hopes were utterly dashed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A disappointment, indeed.  And a sore surprise.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yet never did we presume such power could be wielded by this Rolf Buckmann,” the Zaharte captain continued.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Power’?” echoed the margrave, bending up a brow.  “That <i>ungraced?</i>  Taking sword in hand and hewing our men?  I should sooner believe a bloodlusting hare did the deed.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“He was heard clearly claiming the name of ‘Rolf’, Excellency,” Viola explained.  “Eyes on the ground, too, attest to him matching the commandant’s mien.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hmng…”</i> the margrave heatedly groaned.  This was not to be believed.  And neither did he wish to.  A mistake of a man, disavowed by the Deiva—an ungraced, <i>vanquishing</i> those <i>wielding</i> grace?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Impossible.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A heretic of a happening.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Whatever foreboding the margrave felt before, now ballooned into a morbid image, a future finding his flesh sundered by the sword of that selfsame ungraced.  A lamb, ever loving of Yoná the shepherd, now set to be slain by some ragged wolf?  What nightmare was this?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Why, none other than a vision veering far from all rightness and reason.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Be that as it may,” the margrave spoke at last, “at present does the enemy loiter in my city…  The hour-sand empties—I must act.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Your Excellency,” said Viola.  “The hostiles to the east have moved; they’ve entered the fief-burgh from the north, and regroup with the rest of their companions as we speak.  Once rallied and reorganised, likely they shall march anew at the soonest.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so they would.  Such was the Zaharte captain’s hard-gained conclusion: if the past two battles taught her aught, it was that the enemy was capable, and arrantly so, at that.  They proved formidable enough when split in four… and now they meant to merge and set every blade loose upon the margrave’s neck.  So dread a momentum must not be left unchecked.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That I know,” snapped the lordly mark.  “My men make no less haste to muster an answer.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But too much haste and one hurries only to the grave.  This the margrave learnt well, for the battle of Balasthea was a bitter teacher.  Unbolstered by preparation and spurred on by false intelligence, there were his men struck a cunning blow.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Never again.  <i>Never.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">One trap was more than enough for the margrave, and so was he easily content with reamassing for defence what little remained of his men, rather than having them spring zealously upon unrallied foes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For her part, Viola was much relieved that, despite his dire plight, the margrave was yet sound of judgement.  She had well-thought him fain for another fool offensive, and one straightway, no less.  Not that any could blame her: long has the margrave waged war with the Nafílim, and fewer tongues were more swift to savour their misery than his.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And so have we,” she echoed.  “Our mobile detachments are returned and rallying presently, Lord.  We shall be ready for fresh orders soon enough.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“As you should,” returned the margrave, before facing Viola in full.  “Captain.  I bid some of your number accompany me.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ever so slightly did the elder Östberg narrow her eyes at those words.  “&#8230;You will depart the fief-burgh, Excellency?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola was nothing if not sharp.  To “flee” or “quit” the city—she dared no such diction before the fraught margrave.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I shall.  The whole of Ström sits upon my shoulders.  And should I fall, it goes with me, deep into the dust…  I must needs head to Tallien at once,” he clarified.  Right to the east laid the viscounty of Tallien, a fitting shelter for a lord in flight.  In fact, that was his very intention.  “You know much of my neighbour, do you not?  Zaharte’s deeds number many over in that land, I hear.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“An honour, Lord,” answered Viola, bowing.  “Indeed, the lay of Tallien is intimate to many of my men; you will find no better bodyguards than they.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Very well.  Assign them to me all the sooner.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The margrave then nodded to the Zaharte captain.  At the same time, her brother also sent to her a gaze of his own.  The remnant forces in Arbel—more must needs be known of their duties from here on, now that their master meant to leave them to the Nafílim wolves.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola returned a confirming look to Theodor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Lord Ström,” she began broaching.  “Might I ask, what shall be our charge, henceforth?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The Fiefguard shall be ordered to stall the enemy till I have long cleared the city walls,” the margrave explained.  “And you, Captain: you shall be the one to give them those very orders.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He looked clothed enough in calm as he aired those words, but in the seams there seethed spouts of displeasure, for it full-punctured his pride to so willingly hand command over <i>his</i> Fiefguard to these sellsword scum.  Yet the luxury of choice was long lost to him, gone with the many dead captains of his men.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It all fell to Viola, then, copiously practised in leadership and combat command as she was.  Such was the situation at hand.  Such was his sole choice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But bending her brows was a look of confusion.  “&#8230;I am to lead them, Excellency?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Having her own men escort the margrave in his flight was not to be argued.  After all, it was his coffers that contained their recompense, and not by his dead hand would the locks be undone.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No, what worried Viola was “risk”, for to stay in Arbel and make battle with broken numbers was a danger beyond daring.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Correct.  If I can hie me to safety, then you need only hold till Central’s reinforcements arrive.  And then shall I requite you all the more handsomely,” the margrave assured her.  “But you will not go unaided, Captain.  I’ve designs enough for your defence.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;What might be those designs, if I may ask?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hark.  To break Arbel, our foe must needs capture three key points: this manor, the Fiefguard’s garrison, and…” to the windows his eyes turned, “&#8230;the concentration camp.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">The margrave’s manor, the Fiefguard garrison—Arbel’s respective seats of policy and police.  Small wonder why the Nafílim horde should hunger for their fall.  But the concentration camp?  Hardly the heart beating in the fief-burgh’s bosom, as it were.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet this was the far march of Ström, straddling right up against Nafílim country from which it has reaped a great many “boons of war”, as its soldiery and slavers were wont to term it.  And what better coffer to contain such brimming “riches” than a concentration camp?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A veritable trove, indeed, ever the dirty buttress to Arbel’s weal.  But in the eyes of Rolf and his newfound friends, it sparkled with a different light—of vanished friends and family, of lovers lost yet unforgotten, of forlorn souls to be sold to a life of drudgery most unjust.  No doubt, then, that the Nafílim enemy should eventually seek their immediate emancipation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Of these, I appoint the camp as our final fastness,” so resolved the margrave to his Zaharte guests.  “A stronghold must needs be made of it.  A quagmire to unmake the enemy!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">His will was well-warranted.  A military headquarters though it was, the Fiefguard garrison was, in practice, little more than an array of offices and training grounds; a house of cards could boast of a sturdier defence than it ever can.  And of course, naught needs be said of the lord’s manor itself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That left the concentration camp.  Myriad and maze-like were its walls, and with a watchtower to boot, its dreadful and dreary spans shone as the most defensible of the three pillars.  Yet that alone ill-allayed the Östbergs’ worries.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Beside his sister stood a serious-faced Theodor, thick in thought, whilst for his part, Sigmund could not have cared any less for the conversation, and so had long left his eyes to wander like those of a witless fish.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Abandon the manor, muster ourselves at the camp… and there lay our last stand,” Viola wondered aloud.  “Theodor.  What reckon you of this?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I… reckon it rather sound,” her brother answered greyly, “if not for our dwindled numbers, that is…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hold there,” the margrave hastily said.  “I have plans enough, if you should lend an ear.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">His portance was dimming with desperation.  Needs and desires filled his head.  A need to have the Zaharte hellions dig in their heels and defend his fief.  A desire to have Viola helm the very effort, to unite both his Fiefguardsmen and her sellswords together in buying him precious time.  For above all else, the margrave wished to be whisked away at once to safety, and the scoundrels before him were his only wings.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yes, desperate, indeed, the margrave, as he verily pleaded for Viola’s heedance.  What a damning difference from the lordliness displayed only yesterday.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But undressed of his dread authority, Aaron Ström was not unlike the next man: blind to his own blunders, never minding his meek and mistaken self that his mirrors much warn of.  Yet the real rub was in how he might yet project a princely portrait, even as he was but a cornered creature, newly enlightened to the shallowness of his strength.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such was what Viola now discerned in the margrave.  She sighed.  Mixed in her mien was pity for the poor lord.  But that pity all but pounced past his pate as he continued speaking.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A herald shall hie hence and to our foes proffer this ultimatum: stand down, or we will cull the captives—each and every one!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Hostages, then, Your Excellency?” asked Viola.  The proposed connivery confounded her little.  In fact, she was convinced it could well-serve the stout rope out of this hole.  Not that it would inspire even the faintest idea of surrender in the Nafílim, no.  Mettle and momentum were on their side, no mistake there—but this ploy just might give the push the defenders needed to turn the tables.  Say, for instance, an offer to free some prisoners, all in exchange for the exiting of enemy troops from the fief-burgh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hostages, indeed,” the margrave confirmed, before glancing to a side door.  “And speak of the devil…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Into the great hall then came a Fiefguardsman.  In tow: a barefoot boy of a Nafíl—not more than six, seven years young.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola eyed him, coldly inquisitive.  “What’s this?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A message,” was the margrave’s curt reply.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A knowing nod.  “&#8230;Ah.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The ultimatum was no bluff—such must be made explicitly clear to the enemy.  And to prove it, this Nafílim boy would serve as the first scapegoat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A warm corpse should make a brilliant banner of our conviction,” proclaimed the margrave.  “Might one of yours do the honours of a flag-bearer, Captain?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But of course, Your Excellency,” Viola flatly accepted.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And then…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…tears.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Many, many tears, welling up in the boy’s eyes as he then slowly looked down.  His ears had heard every word.  His heart had swallowed their every meaning.  But why him?  There was nary a sin upon his head.  An urchin of a slave, chosen on a whim.  That was all he was.  And yet, to place so asudden upon his little shoulders the duty of death…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The weight finally set in.  Now knowing his end, the boy began to shiver and snivel, his tears quietly collecting on the floor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Oi.  Wot you on ‘bout, ah?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Piercing the silence: Sigmund’s gruff and grating voice.  Thereafter was the moment mired in another lull, till Theodor ventured forth an explanation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A deal, Sigmund.  We guarantee the captives’ lives, and our enemies guarantee their withdrawal.  Simple enough.”  The vice-captain then half-sighed.  “Though, whether they’ll comply is anyone’s guess, but we need only force their hand and—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yea, yea, all that rubbish be right clear an’ cut, coz.  But that’s not me point.  That there,” Sigmund said, then flicking his chin at the young Nafíl, “that’s a <i>squirt,</i> not some soldier.  Why’s ‘e got to be off’d, ah?  Makes fuck-all sense, innit?  ‘E’s jus’ a li’l boy, for cryin’ out loud!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Veritable question marks bloomed in all the others’ bosoms.  None knew why Sigmund would speak such spittle.  Then, as though to give voice to their confusion, Viola addressed her subordinate thusly:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Sigmund.  I scarce see the rub here.  Child or no, that’s a <i>Nafíl.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The rub ‘ere, <i>Cap’n,</i> is that we’re <i>fighters,</i> ain’t we?” the swordsman spat back, before pointing to the boy.  “That there squirt: ‘e look like ‘e’s <i>fightin’</i> back to ya?  Ah?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Despite his defiance, Sigmund earned only bewildered squints from his superiors, and as well, a spark of impatience from the margrave.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Enough with this.”  The lord looked to the Fiefguardsman.  “Have it done.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Aye, m’liege!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The soldier’s sword hissed from its sheath—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—and ran right through the boy’s bosom.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Agh…”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A small cry, almost a whisper.  A rivulet of red, spewing from little lips.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Östbergs shut their eyes, brooking none of the sight.  Not out of pity for the child, no, but for the solemn act of execution.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Such was precisely why the siblings, warriors though they were, could neither foresee nor forestall what struck next.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You <i>slag!!</i>  Come ‘ere──!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ghwagh—!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A long blade glinted bright: erupting with rage, Sigmund sprang forth and felled the Fiefguardsman with a mighty swing of his own sword.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Utter shock flashed across the margrave’s face.  “&#8230;Hellion, you!  What roguery is this!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But Sigmund’s indignance was undampened.  “Why!?  Wot’s with you wankers, ah!?” he screamed, canines gnashing, hair swaying.  “‘E’s jus’ a kid!!  A nose-pickin’ brat, damn it!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It was that very “brat”, now laying limp upon the floor, whom Sigmund then took into his arms.  The delicate act drenched his hands in young blood.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Red.  Oh so very red.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Gkh… hhnnggwwoo──hh!!”</i> resounded a roar of roars, ruesome yet wroth. “Blood!  Brat’s blood!  <i>Aaaegh!!</i>  All o’ you!!  All o’ you be <i>damn’d!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The great hall thundered.  Sigmund&#8217;s words: vacuous yet vociferous, violently shaking the very air they rode.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“S-Sigmund!?  Tame yourself!” shouted Viola, but before she could think to restrain him, someone else ventured the deed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ach!  Enough from you!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Fury, not fright, fumed from the margrave, as though teased out by Sigmund’s tantrum, for stinging his ears anew were the former maunderings of Rolf Buckmann: that civilians, Nafílim or no, need not be senselessly slain.  What folly.  Vexation was all he had felt when last he had argued with that ungraced.  And now was that very same vexation fully revived and revealed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">An exigency was at hand.  Arbel hung on the brink, Ström was strung over the pyre, devils stood at the doorstep—and yet did this fool sellsword fain interfere <i>further.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The margrave had endured much.  The failure of his men, consorting with these cutthroats, ceding command over to their captain…  Humiliation after humiliation.  But this was the last straw.  And so in his rage did he reach for the sword at his hip.  A sword worn that he might look the part of the proper commander-in-chief in this challenging time.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…A sword wielded to his own woe.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For never could the margrave have proven a match for Sigmund’s mettle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And never had Sigmund meted mercy to any blade brandished against him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;	</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Rroooaa──hh!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Zsshhrt.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Gahkh…!?”</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Too swiftly had it happened.  Too astonished were the siblings.  There was naught they could have done.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The margrave’s swordtip all but tottered about like a butterfly flitting over foreign fields.  In contrast, Sigmund’s was a straight brushstroke, dragging out of the lord’s flesh a flood of many reds.  From the margrave’s bosom to the marble tiles beneath spilt a splash of warmth, thick and wet.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Aaron Ström knew not the “how” nor the “what”—nor aught of this thunderswift plight.  Letting fall his blade, he bent his gaze down to his gaping breast.  Only then did he know at last.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He had been cut.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He had been <i>killed.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But one question lingered.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Why?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A margrave of mighty Londosius—laid low by a brute’s blade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>Why?</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He thought it most absurd.  So devout a lamb of Yoná he had been.  So devoted a slayer of the Nafílim devils.  And <i>this</i> was his due?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Why?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In seeking the answer with all speed did his mind then melt away unto naught—along with his life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There fell his corpse onto the cold marble, afore the flabbergasted Östbergs.  A corpse comforted by but one thought before its death: of having fallen to no blade brandished by the ungraced it so despised.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">The dust was long settled.  The blood, the bodies—all had been wiped and whisked away to the shadows.  Only silence lingered on in the great hall.  And standing amidst it: a lone Viola.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">After the slaying…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It was then that Sigmund had scooped up the unmoving boy and bolted from the manor.  So swift was the incident that the Östbergs were left arrantly pale and petrified, but a moment, and again were they composed.  After next pondering aught and all that should happen from this mishap, they then began setting their scheme into motion.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The present found Theodor outdoors, having left his sister to steep in her thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oi, Viola.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Stamping now into the hall was Ulrik, his face full-puckered with fury.  The retreat from Rolf Buckmann sore-stung him yet, a humbling pain all too obvious to his captain’s eyes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ulrik.  You seem sprightly,” Viola flatly remarked.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yea.  An’ right ready besides,” the halberdier hissed back.  True enough, Zaharte’s skilled surgiens had his wound soundly sealed up.  Not the full recovery he had hoped for, of course, but reckoning a return to battle as the meeter remedy than the infirmary bed, he had thought at once to seek his superior and implore deployment.  “That Rolf Buckmann…!” he seethed, clenching his fists white.  “Just give th’word, Viola, an’ I’ll ‘ave ‘is guts all gouged an’ garnish’d fer th’dogs t’dine on, I will!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Thin your enthusiasm, will you?” she sighed in answer, slowly shaking her head.  “Whether you face him again or no is mine to decide.  And I’ve decided that you’d best be a good boy for the time being.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The halberdier’s eyelids twitched.  “Don’t ye go pissin’ on me parade, Viola!  I’ve gots me an axe t’grind, I does!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ulrik.  Heed me.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Say wot ye wants, this score won’t settle itse—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ulrik.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All warmth was at once vanished from Viola’s voice.  And with the morning chill yet frosting the air in the hall, Ulrik could do naught but let the combined cold cut into his skin.  Her reason triumphed over his rage—the Zaharte captain was most resolute to loose him upon the ungraced <i>never</i> again.  He had proven fangless in a two-on-one; weighed down with a wound, what hope had this brute now in exacting his fool revenge <i>alone?</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ulrik pressed his lips shut and carefully gulped.  The slight sound resounded clear through the silent hall, before: “&#8230;Bah!” he spat, turning away.  <i>“Fine.</i>  More time fer maimin’ mirkskins it is, then.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Your butcher’s block’ll be busy, I assure you,” Viola remarked without spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hemph.</i>  An’ wot ‘bout you, eh?  ‘Ere all ‘lone?” asked Ulrik, finding none of the others present.  “Where be that brother o’ yers, mm?  An’ Sigmund besides?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Theodor’s busy outside,” answered Viola just as flatly, her visage unchanging.  “And as for Sigmund—he’s quit our company.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;Auh!?”</i>  Ulrik’s eyes widened at once, only to find Viola’s turning away swiftly without a word, as though to signal the sudden end to the topic.  Espying this, the halberdier crossly curled his lips.  <i>“Peh…</i>  Good!  Spare me yer squabbles—give me ‘eads to ‘atchet an’ I’m ‘appy.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Your cooperation is encouraging.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No further did Ulrik dwell on the matter.  From the outset had he always taken Sigmund for an untrustworthy churl: though theirs was hardly a long-standing partnership, Ulrik ever scried something… <i>astray,</i> deep in that swordsman.  Like a tree hiding strange roots, or a room with more doors than meets the eye.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The next battle’s a defensive one—a last stand at the concentration camp,” Viola continued.  “Go seek Theodor.  He’ll brief you on the rest.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yea, yea,” Ulrik replied brusquely.  Viola watched him with intent, pinning some hope in this yet-promising pawn of hers as he departed the great hall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Still here, Sis?” said Theodor, newly returned to the great hall.  “The briefing’s over with.  And Ulrik’s scurried off to the camp as told.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I see…  Well-done,” Viola greyly replied.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With orders freshly handed to the few remaining Fiefguard leaders, it was high time the Östbergs headed off to the concentration camp themselves.  There would they assume command of the late margrave’s men and dictate the particulars of the clash to come.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“How now, dear Sister.  The margrave’s left just about all the reins to you, hasn’t he?  Quite the silver lining, if there ever was one,” cheered a rather chipper Theodor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola faintly smiled in return.  “A fair point.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That the Zaharte captain should be appointed as their temporal commander was something full-suspected by the Fiefguard leadership.  After all, many of their late colleagues were now as feed for the worms outside Balasthea, a miscalculation that had moved the margrave to fevered scheming—even more so with last night’s breaching of Arbel’s gates.  Tense discourse was had before the break of dawn, during which was made most apparent the margrave’s mind: he meant to steal away to the viscounty of Tallien, whilst leaving the city’s defenders to stall for time.  Such explained the securing of a slave Nafíl for this very purpose.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thus did they bat not an eye when Theodor revealed to them the margrave’s intent for Viola.  Only, that selfsame margrave was now dead—a development the Östbergs opted to obscure, as airing the lord’s untimely death now would at once damn the defenders to admitting defeat, most certainly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not that any oath bound the Östbergs to this battle.  Hardly so; they were sellswords, after all.  Coin was their chief concern.  Were Arbel to fall, they had only to pack up and pelt away into the sunset, unchided and unchallenged.  The margrave had known as much; little wonder why his desperation was so doubled in leashing them to the fray.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Why stay, then?  Simple: it was Sigmund, a <i>Zaharte hand,</i> that had hewn the margrave.  Should such a detail come to light, doubtless the siblings would shoulder the heavy blame.  Not on pain of death, perhaps, but the stigma would surely spell the end of the Zaharte Battalion.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Hence was the free company yet coiled to this conflict, with the Östbergs intent on dressing the margrave’s death as mere “collateral damage” once the battle was done with.  But a silver lining loomed, just as Theodor had said.  An opportunity in this pale plight, promising furtherance for one precious fancy: the siblings’ secret ambition.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A fief, all to our own,” Theodor thought aloud wistfully.  “You really think we’ve the hand for such a gamble, Sis?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“We’ll know once all the cards are laid,” answered the other Östberg.  “But this, I can say: the reward is well-worth the wager.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Within her words could be felt the fire of determination.  In recalling the courses trod to reach to this moment, the sister steeled anew her resolve.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Four daughters.  Five sons.  Such was the issue of their father.  And such was Viola’s and Theodor’s misfortune, to be the youngest of them all, of a baron-house bereft of both land and leverage.  A bubble of a family threatening to burst—most lords so ill-starred ever drown themselves in dragging their households from the gaping maws of irrelevance and ruin.  The Baron Östberg was no different.  Of his many children, it was his eldest sons who earned a reflection in his cold eyes, for it was from amongst them that their father resolved to one day select as the house’s next head.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Why, not even as pawns for political marriage could the two siblings have served.  Above them stood no less than seven other brothers and sisters, each as capable as they were comely.  And plenty besides: the baron thought it enough to pour into them all his plans and leave his last two to while their days away.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So it was that Viola and Theodor were conferred the comfort of neither parental faith nor fondness, but merely food, clothes, and shelter.  Shunned they were not, no.  Only, they had no purpose imparted to them, no place in the great Östberg enterprise.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not even to the occasional manor banquet or soirée were they welcomed.  Such were stages wherein House Östberg could break bread and bond with the other nobility, not some playground for urchins of ill-promise, no, no, not at all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so would the two pretend their own party.  Whilst their elder brothers mingled with noble damsels over wine and witticisms, little Viola and Theodor instead tucked themselves away to the kitchen corner.  There they mingled like mice, just the two of them, prattling on about the day’s happenings over a saucer of assorted cheeses and nuts.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A humble mockery.  But for them, a happy memory.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Little Viola and little Theodor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Childish cheeks chock-full of peanuts and pistachios.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sister and brother, smiling and beaming in whole harmony.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Their brothers plied the sword on the daily, as well, with instructors watching closely anear.  And from the corridor or behind a cracked door could oft be found the two siblings sneaking a peek, their eyes filled with wonder and willingness to learn the same craft.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thus one day, with twigs picked from near the wood, they attempted to mimick their brothers’ mettle, and just as they had thought, it was a merry activity, indeed.  From noon till eventide did they swing and swashbuckle, panting and puffing, their twigs ever twirling and their sunny smiles never setting.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Soon enough, they sought the manor-soldiery’s attention, that their playful practice might be minded.  The soldiers humoured them, and when time allowed, even taught the siblings some tricks of the martial trade.  Only, the grunts wielded spears, not swords.  But no matter.  To the little ones, lessons of the spear were no less splendid.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Days absolutely singing with smiles.  So long as the two were together.  So long as the two had one another.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still, they were children, yearning no less than the next child for the love of their parents.  Hence whensoever their father flickered naught but callous eyes at them, little Viola and Theodor could but quail, lonely and sorrowful.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Children, neither neglected nor loved.  A tragedy, all the same.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And one that saw no alleviation, even with the passing of many seasons.  Thus did they chance a change by their own hands: soon after Theodor’s fifteenth birthday and his reception at the Roun of Orisons, the siblings quit the Östberg manor and made off into the wide open world.  Their destination: the mercenary guilds.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not that the doors of the knightly Orders were shut to them.  No.  Such a choice they eschewed.  The sellsword’s life was more their mind.  To fare far away from family and father alike.  To forge their own way, together and only together.  This was their solemn resolve.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A resolve their father ill-repudiated.  Oh, but of course.  He cared not.  Why, it was two fewer burdens upon his strained shoulders.  Thus was silent consent given, to go wheresoever and do whatsoever they pleased.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so from that day till this did the Östberg siblings scratch and scour their way through a world of coin and conflict.  With spears of splendour and magicks of might, they swiftly became a household name.  And before long, they even found themselves commanders to their very own band of mercenaries, richly regarded, known far and wide to the very fringes of Londosius.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Perhaps far enough to reach their father’s ears.  Or, perhaps not.  True enough, not since the day of their departure have the two heard from the baron.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">An annoyance this proved to the pair.  But just an annoyance.  Though more so for Viola.  Suppose they had wanted to surprise their father; tease out some regret from that mirthless man.  Even then, they would have confessed the fancy to be but faint and half-humoured.  Why, if surprise was to be had, it was on the part of the siblings themselves.  Here they were, already decorated and accomplished, and <i>still</i> not a single word from the baron?  How busied he must be.  How buried in bolstering the Östberg tree.  How oblivious to aught beyond the bounds of his corner of the world.  Of this, the siblings were reminded anew.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Suppose this, then.  Viola and Theodor, masters to a new <i>fief,</i> founders to a new and ennobled <i>family.</i>  What sayest thou, oh cold father?  Art thine uncherished children now worth thy warmth?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A jest, of course.  One exchanged many a time between the two siblings.  A jest and a dream, never to fruit beyond a fantasy.  But now was that fruit afore their very eyes, real and ready to ripen, as if nurtured by the heavenly hand of Yoná Herself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Margrave Aaron Ström left behind nary a child of his own.  This past year saw the last breath of his beloved, and not since has he thought to welcome in a new wife.  Why, he was himself the sole scion of his line, brotherless and sisterless.  Despite this, or perhaps because of this, always had he felt it his duty to dam the flood of Nafílim, and sure enough, to this very purpose had he spent all his days, as though his very pride were pennoned upon the spears of his men.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The margrave’ll be snug in his coffin soon enough, but with not one bloodkin alive, his will be a lonely funeral,” Viola explained.  Her voice was low, her conviction clear.  “This land of his, however… it’ll all be fair game.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Fair game, sure, but will <i>we</i> have a seat at the contest?  We’re but witnesses to the crime, after all.  Who’s to say Central’s hawks won’t swoop in and hand off this land to some other silver-spoon?  Or snatch the reins themselves, for that matter?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Theodor’s doubts were most warranted.  But his sister had a ready answer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Haven’t you heard?  The Mareschal Emilie Valenius—she herself was given a fief, one once ruled by a viscount, perverted and now punished.  A land lost of its lord; a lord whose son the mareschal was once set to wed,” she said at length, still low of volume.  “That was reason enough for Central to tie the bow on her boon… curious, given that she’s met the villain viscount not once.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Theodor’s brows bent up.  “G… ‘given’, you say?  A whole fief?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ah, yes—Emilie Valenius.  The Lady of the Levinblade, a Londosian hero-dame next only to Estelle Tiselius herself.  Famed for being first amongst all in history to serve as both mareschal to an Order and mistress to her own house.  But that such history hid behind the brilliance came as news to the Zaharte vice-captain’s ears.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Theodor.  Central’s talons grow bloodier by the day.  The lions of Londosius hunt more hungrily than ever before.  This kingdom craves for heroes; ones mighty enough to man its chariots.  Heroes like Emilie Valenius—like <i>us,”</i> Viola expounded.  A clear-cut explanation for her brother… and for herself, an affirmation of her dearest ambition.  “We’re not wanting of feats and fame, are we?” she continued.  “The Östberg siblings, twin spearheads of the Zaharte Battalion, renowned in <i>all the realm.</i>  A princely précis, wouldn’t you say?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I would… sure,” Theodor nodded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What’s more, the Mareschal Valenius is cut from the same cloth as we,” added Viola.  “A child of a troveless, landless baron, of a family with no future.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“An endling, just as we are…” her brother thought aloud, rubbing his chin.  “&#8230;Quite the compelling case, I’ll admit.  And a gamble truly worth our wager, as you’ve said.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thus were sibling minds as one again.  To assay the summit with sword and steeled ambition—such was the only constant in this cauldron of conflict.  Thus should this truly be a treasure chest of a chance, then they had but to reach and wrest it for themselves.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I suppose that’s why you’ve skipped on the margrave’s hostage scheme?” Theodor asked, to which Viola nodded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ström—a margravate now without a margrave.  A land now listing to its own doom.  And the ones to inherit the late lord’s will?  The heroes to hew the foreign harriers?  A sellsword sister and her brother, endlings to an ennobled line.  Truly the stuff of legends, given no small substance by their preceding repute.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But one key was missing: a vaunted victory.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A victory of arms, a victory of virtue.  Not by succumbing to vices, by claiming triumph through treating with the enemy on threat of disthroating helpless hostages, would Central have fancied the siblings worthy of a fief.  And so did the siblings <i>need</i> this battle, and they needed it <i>won</i>—cleanly, and without question.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“We’ll quit the manor and muster straightway at the camp,” said Viola.  “No doubt the rush’ll rouse the enemy’s ears, but all the better: we’ll welcome them into our den… and there rip them to pieces.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All told, the Zaharte captain saw much worth yet in the margrave’s former plans.  The concentration camp certainly was defensible, thick-walled as it was.  And an irresistible lure besides, rife with the stench of Nafílim captives too tempting to the enemy’s noses.  They would come, sooner or later.  And if later, then all the better.  Viola meant to use every afforded minute in perfecting her trap.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Our most prized prey will be the ungraced himself,” the Zaharte captain concluded.  “His is the keenest nose of them all—and the one most temptable.  Once in our midst, Östberg spears shall drink deep of Rolf Buckmann’s blood.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And be as pikes to present his traitorous head.  Such was the vision seen in Viola’s eyes as her brother looked intently back.  He then nodded fully, now on deck with his sister’s determination.  Nay, <i>their</i> determination.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Till there, within earshot—a third voice, murmuring.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Rolf… Buckmann…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Standing at the doorway was the sister to that very name.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola very nearly clucked her tongue, stung anew by the brigadier’s insistent presence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The margrave himself had deemed this dame a wildcard, a worry the Zaharte captain, too, came to share.  Indeed, Felicia’s plight perhaps struck a mite too close to home for Viola: Theodor was her constant companion, a brother for whom she brooked no replacement… but were he to turn traitor as Rolf the renegade had, what would become of <i>her</i> own heart?  <i>Her</i> own conduct?  The captain could scarce imagine, and that was precisely why she saw in the brigadier a bomb waiting to blow at the slightest spark.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Siren-bells were now blaring in her head, but to stay the dame from sniffing out any foulness afoot, Viola kept her tense visage turned away from the doorway.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“His name sounds a secret upon your lips,” Felicia remarked, walking slowly in.  “Why?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“W-Why?  Well, he’s er, he’s… he’s been sighted, Brigadier—on the other side, I fear,” Theodor relented, stammering as he saw to the side his sister racing through a thousand thoughts.  Something <i>must</i> be done about this dame.  But what?  Viola was yet concerned that in Felicia there burnt some secret fire, a yearning to break her Londosian bonds and join her brother in his betrayal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such must not come to pass.  This sister of Rolf—she must be caged off.  Far from the battlefield.  Far from her brother.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then… then pray let me see him, if he’s there, as you say,” Felicia earnestly entreated.  “He’ll lend ear to me.  I know he will.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">An amicable reconciliation?  Through discourse?  Damned words upon the Östbergs’ ears.  They rather desired Rolf Buckmann’s very death—nay, they <i>needed</i> it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“His Excellency said it himself ereyesterday, did he not?” Viola reminded the dame, turning at last to meet her ruby eyes.  “I’m afraid parleying is off the table, Brigadier.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia glanced about the great hall.  “And where might he be, the lord?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“He’s awayed to safety,” answered Viola, “but not before trusting all command to me.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At once, Felicia’s gaze flashed with urgency.  “Th-then allow me in the next battle!  I’ll find my brother, for certain!  And persuade his surrender!  He’ll heed me!  He will!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What ill.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola veritably grinded her teeth, if only in her heart.  Parleying was impossible, a truth aired with all clarity, and <i>still</i> this foe-sister insisted upon the contrary.  More and more she seemed steeped in self-deception, a damsel in denial, coursed away from all common sense.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Brigadier,” Viola began firmly.  “That brother of yours has sore-scorned both Crown and kinsmen, choosing instead to walk the treacher’s way—for why we can never know.  And in bringing to bear the full brunt of his fearsome prowess has he made culled and cornered curs of the once-proud Fiefguard.  Who with right mind, then, should reckon he surrender when such a <i>storm</i> it is he rides against us?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Strained silence was Felicia’s only answer.  Her gaze was turned away.  What emotion moiled in them was beyond the present ken of the Östbergs.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Brigadier?” pressed Viola, perturbed by the quietude.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">After a stifling moment, “&#8230;If he’ll not surrender, then I will <i>still</i> that storm of his… and leash him back with all limbs bound, if need be.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Low was her voice.  Uncharacteristically so.  Freshly apparent to the Östbergs’ eyes was something… <i>dark,</i> deep within the depths of the dame.  A shade in the shadows, roused wroth by some word uttered in the exchange just now.  But which word, which phrase exactly, Viola knew not.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There was no mistaking it, then.  Fraught as a field of thorns, this Felicia, a thought the Östberg sister was reminded of anew.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You look to unleash a storm of your own, Brigadier.  But even an errant breeze can dare to decide this delicate battle,” said Viola.  “The whole of Ström hangs by a thread.  Much succour you’ll serve by but sitting still.  And I beseech that you do.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I’ll not be a burden.  Not in battle, not in aught,” Felicia resisted.  “I mean only to meet my brother.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This dame was having none of it.  Not of reason, of restraint.  Such stubbornness seemed to have pushed the Zaharte captain over some cliff, for her next utterance, while quiet, grated with annoyance:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;If words shall still you not, then perhaps the lock and chain might.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You fancy yourself a keymaster like the margrave, Captain?” Felicia snapped back, undeterred.  “Martial command was what’s trusted to you, not provincial rule.  So unless you mean to wield the Excellency’s sceptre behind his back, I will do as I please.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Now was Viola herself strained with silence.  And indeed the whole of the great hall’s air.  Theodor stood petrified, sweat shining fresh upon his forehead.  Little need be said as to what havock his sister could wreak, given enough… persuasion.  But aface her was no less than a dame brigadier of the Order, a champion of matching mettle.  Such power and authority it was that invested these two, yet they seemed more keen to bicker like irritable babes than battle the foes now affrighting the fief-burgh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For her part, the Östberg sister was no less urged by the same imperative.  The grand plan was nearly in play, the pieces all set to pounce.  But barring their way: this mulish maiden of the Order.  Not more than twenty winters has she lived, and already was she proving more a handful than hot iron.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Stilling her own storm within her bosom, Viola yielded a deep breath and broached the most pressing matter.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Then allow me this, Brigadier: I trust you’ve not the same mind as Rolf Buckmann’s, yes?  To fly the same flag as his?  To curse the good name of Londosius, all that you might stand again by your brother’s side?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Do you take me for some fawning pup?” Felicia asked back, slightly narrowing her eyes.  “My bumbling brother’s the one at fault here.  Sisterly duty demands not that I echo his mistakes, but that I put them to rights.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola remained quiet against the cutting answer, calming herself and contemplating in the meanwhile.  So bull-like a brigadier would ill-brook a ban from the battlefield.  Indeed, force her away and she would force herself back in all the more doggedly, and there destroy all their dearest efforts.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No choice, then.  Bring her in, why not?  Let her drink deep the battle-air to her heart’s content—but from the far back, where would never be found any sight of Rolf Buckmann.  Such was Viola’s new reasoning, which she put to task at once.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Very well, then,” she relented, rising out of her thoughts.  “The battle moves to the concentration camp.  There shall we muster defences against the enemy’s forthcoming advance.  You have my permission to participate, but not at the frontlines—the rearguard is your place and <i>only</i> place.  Is that clear, Brigadier?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Tis indeed,” answered Felicia.  “My thanks, Captain.”  Bowing quickly, she turned heel and headed to the corridor.  The Östbergs watched on with nary a word, but then found the brigadier stopping asudden under the doorway.  To them she then turned her face, and with a sidelong look, gave them their warning: “Worry not.  I’ll churn up no trouble of my own… but for any shadows you send to haunt my steps.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;The thought never crossed my mind.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Verily, for by now, Viola sooner fancied snuffing out the dame altogether than babysitting her from afar.  But this Felicia purportedly shared intimate rapport with the Lady Valenius, and was herself set to be the next head of House Buckmann; though her brother’s betrayal might usher in some foulness to her family, Felicia’s was an ire too ill to earn yet.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A tightrope it was that the Östbergs were balanced on.  Their dreams, their hopes, all laid at the far end; not now could they afford to fall off, nor invite any sparks that might ignite their precarious purchase.  And though Felicia was proving the fire-wind of their fears, not by their hand could she be hushed or hewn.  Seeing the brigadier disappear into the corridor, they found themselves begrudgingly content with having leashed her to some lonely corner of the battlefield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A muffled thud sounded—the shutting of the manor’s main entrance, signalling the brigadier’s full absence.  Viola sighed audibly.  To his tired sister did Theodor then speak.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Well.  A pleasant little princess, wasn’t she?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Pain applauds that ‘pleasantness’ of hers,” Viola hissed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I’d say, you had the right of it, though: that Rolf Buckmann bloke doesn’t seem the sort to surrender,” Theodor remarked, earning a nod from his sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Dealing with the dame as they did was far from ideal, but better to nip a risk at the bud than after its bloom.  Such was the siblings’ reasoning.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf Buckmann—it was his head on a pike they wanted, not his surrender.  But that was fine and well, for just as Theodor had concluded, almost certainly would the ungraced traitor not be surrendering any time soon, even when so sued by his very own sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Though suppose such a meeting was the hand dealt, one precipitating a stalemate, for certain.  Felicia, in all her magicked mightiness, would bring her brother to heel, just as promised.  Hardly the unsought scenario, in fact, as the feat will have been performed under Viola’s command, and hence would the Zaharte name earn yet another lustre.  Indeed, more and more the situation sounded less fraught than first espied.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But I admit, the thought of the brigadier jumping to her brother’s ship has me shivering in my boots a little.  Even if she seemed unwilling,” Theodor continued.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then she’ll burn along with that precious ship of hers.  A fitting pyre for a perfidious witch,” Viola remarked coldly.  “Justice abets our banner; none shall bat an eye should we lay the torch.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet no torch should be needed; that the brigadier would follow her brother was a fool’s fancy.  <i>‘My bumbling brother’s the one at fault here’</i> were her own words, and in Viola’s ears, they had nary a note of deception in them.  Never, then, should she so much as stain a standard of Londosius—not according to the Zaharte captain’s keen ken, anyway.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Preferable she never meets her brother, all told.  Though if meet they do, he’ll not give in—not even to his own sister.  And if she does her ‘sisterly duty’, then all the better: Rolf Buckmann shall be brought before us, with Zaharte claiming the catch.  But if our brigadier joins her brother, then it’s the shared grave that awaits them,” Viola explained at length.  “All cases covered—our way is open, Theodor.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Well… there is <i>one</i> you left out,” said her brother.  “The case of the brother vanquishing his sister.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Quite the fair point.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf was reckoned to be feeble and fangless in battle.  Yet what flood was it that he single-handedly dammed and diverted into flight?  Why, one by the twin names of Ulrik and Sigmund.  Could the Dame Brigadier Felicia Buckmann bring a mightier challenge?  Perhaps not.  Perhaps she would be undone by the blade of her own bloodkin.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And if so, it would be with the sibling spears of the Östbergs that Rolf would next vie.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Why, Theodor,” Viola cooed, curling up her lips.  “Is that not the best case of them all?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Hers was a moon of a smile, crescent and crimson-rouged, as though she had found the next prey for her feast.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And contrary to the increasing rays of the morning, a great curtain was now closing upon this battle for Arbel.  A bloodfest of a fray, muddied in the myriad motives of its contenders.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">The sun was risen above Arbel.  Our braves buzzed and bustled with preparations as we were all mustered within a market square at the fief-burgh’s north end.  The citizenry here seemed long-evacuated; the townscape sat eerily still under morrowing rays.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not long before were we joined by Volker and his contingent after their harrying of the east gates.  Reunited now as we were, what remained was to reorganise and rearm ourselves for the principal push towards the margrave’s manor.  Only…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A mis’ry to admit, but no other way can I see: the sire of this city seeks flight… if not yet has he taken wing,” Volker concluded, slightly scowling at a map of Arbel splayed upon a vacant stall.  A fortunate find, procured by his braves from a local bibliotheca whilst en route to our position.  But that seemed where their—and our—luck ran dry.  Other leaders, too, were present for the meeting.  Their faces were no less furrowed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A pain without prevention…” Lise remarked without spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Painful, indeed, to let slip the margrave from our reach.  With backing from Central has House Ström presided over these lands for many generations.  Such history was a harrier to us: even were we to capture this fief-burgh, so long as the margrave yet drew breath—whether in hiding or hale in the home of some other lord—ours would prove only a vain victory.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Aaron Ström, lord of a land wrenched away by Rolf the renegade and his horde of Nafílim…  He has but to bellow and embellish this injustice, and droves would fast flock under his flag, and thence engulf us with numbers beyond our answering.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet Lise scried correctly another thorny truth: we had not the power to prevent such a scenario.  Arbel was too big a fief-burgh, its walls too long, its gates too many.  Superior to its defenders’ may be our number, but to <i>surround</i> the city itself?  Would that our current count were manyfold more for such a snare, but alas.  Should the margrave risk an escape, then, he would find it an easy flight.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Guessing his routes out of the city and waylaying them each was certainly actionable, but that would entail another splitting of our forces.  A sour proposition, made rancid by the look of last night’s battle.  There did the Fiefguard fight with newfound friends, whose mettle we’d yet to measure in full.  Unreckoned risks, unsought surprises; we could but abandon the chase.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The taking of the fief-burgh, then, seemed our most requiting course, despite its danger.  Thus did we devote ourselves to this very purpose.  Let the margrave run, but in his absence, capture the cruces of his city and neutralise the remnant Fiefguard—if all fares to plan, Arbel, and indeed all of Ström, shall be ours… for a tenuous while, at least.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Unfain be the Fiefguard to make a barricade of their garrison,” Volker uttered before turning to me.  “Rolf.  This stands true yet?  Or?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“It does,” I answered.  “The Fiefguard garrison might be a military facility, but it is hardly a fastness.  Mere offices make for poor protection, you see.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To this, the war-chief exhaled thoughtfully before looking back to the map.  “Then that leaves but one…” he said.  A finger of his next tapped upon a particular spot on the parchment.  All eyes followed.  All heads nodded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The concentration camp—one of Arbel’s cores we’d been well-set on capturing.  Innocents were interned there: friends, family, fellow kin.  We’d thought to liberate them as soon as the city fell… but if the Fiefguard meant to make their last stand there in that very camp, then we had no choice but to follow and fight, even at peril to the prisoners within.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Walls, surrounding ev’ry side…” Volker muttered on, arms folded, “&#8230;and a lone gate as its mouth.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">True to its purpose, the concentration camp was completely palisaded.  It had many gates, to be sure, but only the frontmost of them was of any substantial size.  All the others were side doors and entrances, really, through none of which can two persons pass abreast.  Indeed, a layout full-keen on keeping prisoners in—but what of keeping enemies <i>out?</i>  Not so on paper, but perhaps in practice; a gamble the Fiefguard seemed quite keen on.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Though that made our plight no less precarious.  The side gates would avail us little; our only course, then, was to crash right into the front gate and meet the Fiefguard at their fiercest.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A word, if I may,” spoke a Staffelhaupt, hand raised, at whom Volker nodded.  “Many of our kin are kept captive in the camp—nay, in all the city itself.  Though I fear it… might the Men make hostages of them?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Mm…  This, too, have I reckon’d, that our enemy should fain make demands than risk resistance.  But as yet, none have reach’d my ears,” answered Volker, before looking to Lise.  “What of yours, Edelfräulein?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A shake of the head.  “Not one chirp.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Resorting to hostage-taking indeed counted amongst the few paths left to our foe.  Yet just as revealed by Volker and Lise, it remained unventured to this moment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But absent such demands… what of injury?  To our captive kin?  They will yet quail in their cages amidst all the combat to come; won’t our enemy put them to the sword in some fit of desperation?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Staffelhaupt’s voice listed uneasily, yet his face had the look of determination.  Doubtless his bosom both brimmed with worry for the captives and burnt with a dream to see them all freed.  Thus I raised my own hand and spoke firmly, intent upon settling the uncertainty:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A word, if I may.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To which Lise gave a puzzled look.  “Courteous for a commander, aren’t you?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Embarrassed, I let fall my hand.  Mimicking the Staffelhaupt was, in fact, a courtesy on my part, albeit one as vain as it was a vice: cautious of conduct though I’d been thus far that I might earn recognition from my new comrades, it seemed my awkward ways weren’t doing me any favours.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Clearing my throat, I tried once more.  “&#8230;I say, his concern hits the mark: our enemies make no demands now, but corner them enough, and they might soon see the appeal of holding innocents at swordpoint.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Words bitter upon everyone’s ears.  Going by the gravity in their collective regard, it was clear this Staffelhaupt was hardly alone in worrying after the captives.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What’s more, these Men’ve made mice of themselves, huddled in their last hole,” I continued.  “If past battles have taught us aught, it is that fraught footmen seek solace above all.  But allowed none, they <i>will</i> find it where they can—even from the death-wails of innocents, as though to crave companions on their way to hell.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Grim grimaces from all around.  A natural response.  Grief, not gaiety, would be ours to bear if the trophies of our triumph were the corpses of the very souls we sought to save.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then… then what be our hand in this ill game?” asked the Staffelhaupt.  Any unease he had before now simmered with urgency.  My guess: one amongst the interned was most intimate to him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A swift one,” I answered. “We move as a gale.  Blitz the gates, speed a squad into the bastille; once inside, they will secure and extract the captives, each and every one.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The concentration camp was none too complex.  It had but three buildings of note: a bastille, a watchtower, and a warden-house.  In the first were the captives kept, and come the final clash, the turnkeys on duty would likely all be deployed to dam our offence.  <i>This</i> was the moment, the prime opportunity to pierce the chaos and collect the unguarded captives.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Simple, yet sound,” reckoned Volker.  “But that begs the question: to whom falls the task?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Those with mettle enough unaided—the standalone soldier,” was my answer, to which everyone began exchanging looks, as though to seek out the candidates for the undertaking.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In the midst of all the measuring, one voice spoke out.  “Rolf has my vote.  For his mettle can I vouch.”  The words of an intermediate commander, himself a participant in the northern offensive this past night.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But not for <i>mine,</i> hmm?” the jarl-daughter poked, lips pouting.  “‘Lise’s mettle is unmatched’; whose often words were those, I wonder?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A mere jape, of course, but not to the commander’s ears, supposedly.  “N-nay, Fräulein, yours be mighty enough, for true…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Well?  What think you all?” Volker asked the other leaders.  Silence gripped the group once more, till one amongst them stepped forth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Rolf’s is a sword swift and true,” he said.  “This have I seen.  And so do I measure him… a Man worthy of our trust.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…”Trust”.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For me.  A <i>Man.</i>  Their erstwhile enemy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet none uttered a wisp of dissent.  Some even nodded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You have their hopes, Rolf,” remarked Volker.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And I will answer them,” I returned.  “Only, you all trust to me more than is due—I can’t go it alone.  A few under my wing should well-suffice; Man that I am, I fear the sight of me will sooner cow the captives than comfort them.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Mete words.  The assignments be mine to make, then,” the war-chief agreed, at once drawing his attention down to a muster roll.  At his side was Lise, who gave me a glance of some urgency.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“One more matter, Rolf,” she said.  “On the sellswords, if you will.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Right,” I nodded.  Then, standing before the leaders, I raised my voice.  “Braves all, listen close!  The margrave has turned to mercenaries, that his diminished men might be bolstered.  And by the look of the last battle, already are they arrived and ready to fight.  I’ve seen for myself their symbol—we count amongst our foes now the Zaharte Battalion.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Intelligence delivered, with eyes looking all through the leaders’.  They deserved to know every detail… it might very well save them.  Such was the merciless mettle of our new enemies.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Zaharte’?” echoed another Staffelhaupt.  “A name I have heard.  Two siblings lead that legion.  A deadly duo, if memory serves—the sister, more so.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In the course of his words did his face increasingly pale with apprehension.  The Zaharte name, the Östberg brand—both were infamous even to the Nafílim, evidently.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“It serves well.  But strength attracts strength; <i>all</i> of the Zaharte fighters are a force to be reckoned with,” I confirmed.  “They sport arms and armour no Fiefguardsman wears.  Easy foes to find, but not to fell.  Keep your wits whetted, everyone!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Face them always with greater numbers!  Alone, and only death will be your reward!”  Lise chimed in.  “Indeed, ‘number’ be our key advantage; use it, sustain it, and stay alive!  Let’s not greet our captured kin as corpses!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A tide of nods for the jarl-daughter’s words.  Volker, too, seemed no less agreed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Worthy of mention are the mercenaries’ leadership,” I added.  “They are the deadliest of them all, and—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Enemy!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ears perked.  Eyes flashed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Enemy sighted!  In our vicinity!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Interrupting was a messenger brave as he broke into our gathering.  Tension and shock shot through us all at once.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“They have sprung…!?” Volker said with clenched teeth.  Truly an ill upheaval; at this stage in the battle, the concentration camp should’ve proven the best bastion for our foes.  But to <i>ambush</i> us, instead?  I glowered at the very thought, as did Volker as he growled on, “Right under our noses…!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet the messenger only shook his head.  “N-nay, Chief!  The enemy… something’s amiss…!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　∵　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">An anguished voice vaulted through Arbel’s air as we rushed to the square’s corridor.  Nearing the source, we came upon confounded braves all bunched in a crowd, encircling a single, squatting Man.  In his arms: a boy Nafíl, limp as sodden rope and steeped in blood besides.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oi!  Spare ‘im some mendin’ magicks already, will ya!?  ‘E’s fast fadin’, for shite’s sake!!” screamed the Man, his face full-red and flooded with tears and snot.  “L-look at ‘im!  A boy!  Jus’ a li’l boy!!  <i>Uoooaaa—ah!!</i>  Save ‘im, damn you!  <i>Save ‘im!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Bandaging the boy’s bosom were crude strips of cloth.  Though the bleeding beneath seemed ceased, his breaths wheezed on like a failing wind.  No physician was on hand, yet all eyes knew: this young one was not long for this world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lise turned at once to the nearby braves.  “Where’s the <i>lǣċe!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Already sent for!” answered one amongst them.  “Any moment now till he’s come!  Barbers withal!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Damn it!  Damn it all!!” the Man howled on, glancing desperately about.  “Quit gand’rin’ an’ get movin’, you wankers!  Come on!!  The boy’s one o’ you, innit!?  One o’ you!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Pained and pitiable were his screaming pleas, yet none of the braves dared answer them.  They stood perplexed—petrified, even, struck to stillness by the unsettling scene.  As for myself, sheer shock had rooted me in place; I’d ill-discerned it at first, seeing him so swollen and drenched with tears, but I indeed knew this Man’s face—I knew his <i>sword.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It was Sigmund.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A soldier of fortune… and a sword of Zaharte.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Soon enough, in the midst of his blustering screams, the press of braves made way as through them flew the lǣċe and a team of barber-surgeons.  Straightway, they surrounded the Man and the boy before incanting mending magicks unto the latter and tending to his injury.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A fraught moment followed as we watched in wonder and worry.  In its course, Lise approached the huddled healers.  “How fares he?” she asked, soft but strained.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The wound eludes his vitals,” revealed a barber.  “He may live yet.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Immediately, the crowd sighed a chorus of relief.  Through the entire ordeal was Sigmund, keeping a fevered vigil over the boy.  A look at him, and I understood at once:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This Man was no enemy of ours.<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Wot?  That mutton-pated margrave?  I rived ‘im right open, I did.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sigmund’s words, irreverent as they were revelatory.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The boy’d been treated and brought away to the beds, after which we pressed this Zaharte swordsman as to his puzzle of a predicament.  There he divulged his flight from his fellow sellswords and the plight that precipitated it.  It was then that we so learnt of the margrave’s fate: the lord of Ström, felled by none other than Sigmund himself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A great rustle was roused from all within earshot.  Of course we were shocked.  None could’ve anticipated so untimely a death of the enemy commander-in-chief.  And yet here we were.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Rived him, and what then?” Lise further pressed the swordsman.  “Did he give up the ghost?  Had you time to check, even?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A doubt well-warranted.  By Sigmund’s words, he’d whisked away the boy from the manor right after unmaking the margrave.  Queerly convenient upon the ears, I’ll admit.  But more than aught, we were much wary at the thought of revising our strategy on account of some unconfirmed development.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hah!” Sigmund snorted, shaking his head.  “No need.  That berk o’ a lord—’e’s belly up proper, ‘e is.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such he insisted.  Though strangely enough, I found myself rather convinced.  Sigmund’s sword was as a gashing bear claw, a goring bull horn—strength I’d strived against in the flesh, and thus well-knew the measure of.  And if indeed such strength girded the stroke against the margrave, then it was as Sigmund said: the lord was dead.  Gruesomely so.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The proverbial head we’d so sought to hew, then, was already nipped from its neck.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And yet… still the Fiefguard stir.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Another doubt, now from one of our Staffelhäupter, revealing raw the rub of this situation: our commanderless foe was yet fain to fight.  No demands were made, no safe surrender beseeched, though lost of lord they may be.  The scouts’ reports corroborated the same: the enemies were all of them mustering at the concentration camp, with banners of battle billowing more defiantly than ever…  Passing strange, indeed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yea—this battle’s ‘ad the margrave’s trousers right tricklin’, see,” explained Sigmund.  “So, ‘e thought to shog ‘is arse out o’ the city, an’ left Viola an’ them to lap up the dog’s dinner, ‘e did.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Escape was his scheme all along,” hissed another Staffelhaupt.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">If Sigmund’s account rang true, then so, too, did our reading of the margrave’s mind.  The dots lined up at last: in meaning to flee did he transfer command of his men to Viola, captain of the very band of mercenaries he’d hired.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then it’s Viola Östberg who holds the Fiefguard’s reins now, is it?  A spear-devout, and quite the commander besides, I hear—our foul luck to lock horns with her…” I said at length, all the while glaring at Sigmund, pressing him for more details.  Yet he seemed as helpful as a feral hound, turning the other way with a rather bothered bend in his brows.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hemph,”</i> he scoffed.  “Yea, ‘er spear’s somethin’ else, all right.  But ‘ow good a commander, you ask?  Bugger’d if I know.  Fightin’s me bread an’ butter; giz coin an’ combat, an I’m a ‘appy camper, ya get me?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“How now!” cried a Staffelhaupt.  “Awful lack-minded for a lacquey of hers, aren’t you?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oi, piss off, yea?  Can’t know if I can’t be arsed,” Sigmund barked back, scowling.  “But even if I did, I ain’t ‘bout to be some rat, know wot I mean?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A lone swordsman of a foe, flying into our midst, only to proclaim his taking of his client-commander’s very life—words and deeds too wild for our wits.  Yet that was precisely the skein presented before us.  And as we racked our brains as to how best to untangle it, Volker stepped forth and addressed a pouting Sigmund.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A hyaena you are, then, parted from the pack,” the war-chief reckoned of the mercenary.  “Yet one who refuses to ‘rat them out’, as your kin might say.  You live by some code, Man?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Code’?  Wot, I reeks o’ chivalry to ya, ah?  Bloody ‘ell,” was Sigmund’s bitter answer, earning a reasoned murmur from one amongst our lot:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;But suppose we squeezed a song out of this canary.  What stops him from lacing his lyrics with lies?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Exactly so.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Had Sigmund coughed up aught and all that our ears coveted, who, then, could corroborate his words?  Or soothe our suspicions for some foul ploy played by our foe?  We could ill-afford to exercise compassion in place of caution—not in this situation, at least.  Only, I yet believed Sigmund innocent of our scepticism.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“For shite’s sake—I’m no knight, but I ain’t a bloody knave, either, mate.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Of course not.  Sigmund had been spilling the truth all along.  His screams, his tears—no knave could be moved to such haunting emotion, after all.  And surely we’d given him the succour he so sought; what reason had he to deceive us in return?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Song or silence, we keep our course,” Volker said, resolved.  “Our foe bears a new head: the pair’d pates of the Östbergs.  We have but to sculpt our plans as appropriate.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Volker’s right,” agreed Lise.  “Attack the camp, free the captives, crush the enemy—our way remains unbent.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Hearing the two’s words, I guessed that they’ve scried in Sigmund the same as I had.  It was then that Lise turned full to the Man himself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Now—one last nail to drive in,” she said, sighing and arms akimbo.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You best watch that mallet o’ yours, Missus.  Ya hear!?” Sigmund hissed, pointing at her.  “I brought the brat ‘ere to save ‘im, not surrender meself to you lot, yea?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The swordsman’s insolence was yet undiminished.  In him lingered not an iota of awe or unease, even stood as he was in the midst of an enemy camp.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then ‘tis the ball and chain for you, <i>Mister,”</i> Lise bit back, before sighing again.  “That said, your situation deserves our hospitality than hostility, I admit…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then be hospit’ble-like an’ giz some grub, will ya?” Sigmund demanded, before turning sharp eyes in my direction.  “A full stummy brews back the blood, it does.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That stare of his stabbed with ire, rousing irritation from some amongst us.  Paying it little mind, I ventured a guess as to his seething attitude.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You mean the blood I hewed from your cheek?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hmph,</i> me cheek—wot else, you wank-wit!?” he cried, as though insulted.  “Look ‘ere, ey!  <i>Scraped</i> me skin what’s all ya did!  But if ya wants to <i>hew me,</i> you’d better cut a li’l more deep-like next time, yea?  Down through me very <i>bones!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…”My very bones.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In spite of his gruffness, this Man could air some rather inspiring words, I’ll concede.  My sword had severed naught but the flesh caging the soul that was “Sigmund”.  By that logic does he claim to suffer no wound at all—not till he’s cut free from his flesh.  Such was his meaning, his very mind.  A fascinating one, at that, well-earning from me an inward nod.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Intriguing words, Sigmund,” I returned.  “I’d ask more of you, if I could.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yea?  Then spit.”</p>
