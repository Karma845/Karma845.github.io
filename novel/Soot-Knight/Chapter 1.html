<p class="calibre10">Lilies.</p><p class="calibre10">Lilies-of-the-valley, as far as the eye can see.</p><p class="calibre10">Little bells abloom, all in a white tapestry.</p><p class="calibre10">And a sword, trained exactly upon me.</p><p class="calibre10">Only, not a thought of mine was tasked upon the threat, but instead to the flowers flowing all about.</p><p class="calibre10">Long have I loved them, these lilies.  They promise no pageantry of brilliant blossomings, but nurture in their distinct downcast dangle a particular beauty&mdash;one I well-sense.  One I struggle to weave into words.</p><p class="calibre10">Upon a whim of my wandering eyes was there caught a glance of the blade.  In its tip, a slight quiver, newly betrayed.  In its wielder’s grip, a consternation barely contained.  In its master’s mind, a realisation: how gapes the vaulting valley between our prowess.</p><p class="calibre10">But I paid it no mind.  My eyes left it to shiver ever more, and turned to drown themselves once again in the sea of lily bells.</p><p class="calibre10">Perhaps I should take one home with me.</p><p class="calibre10">They seem the sort to be content with life in a pot.</p><p class="calibre10">A broadly-built man well on his way home, with a stark-sable sword at his hip, and a potted white flower embraced to his bosom.  A silly sight, I admit, sure to garner a good chuckle or two&mdash;smiles I would like to see.  Laughter I would like to hear.</p><p class="calibre10">As these fancies, for battlefields ill-befitting, filled my mind, I took in the scenery once more.</p><p class="calibre10">Ah, yes.</p><p class="calibre10">Lilies like these bloomed, too, upon that hill, on that very day.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>

<p class="calibre10">“You were incredible, Rolf!  I can scarcely believe it!”</p><p class="calibre10">Unrestrained rejoicing from Emilie, her azure eyes wide and fixed upon mine.</p><p class="calibre10">There we were upon that hill.  An undulation of earth, enrobed in bell-bedight lilies.  Its crown: why, none else than Emilie herself, with sunrays scintillating through her flaxen hair and a hearty smile upon her fair visage.</p><p class="calibre10">“You and I both,” I said back, impressed by Emilie’s mirth.  “The fates smiled my way, that’s all it was.  And I’m sure Sir Simon stayed his hand.”</p><p class="calibre10">I had partaken of sword training earlier that day, during which a spar was held.  At its end, I somehow eked out a victory.  And my opponent: the instructor, full-grown and full-fledged.</p><p class="calibre10">At a mere fifteen years of age, my body was already both the height and build of an adult man, and so was not wanting of physical strength.  Would that the same held true for my skill, as I very well stood to lose for lack of it.  That I won at all was owed purely to the fates and my instructor’s own reserve.</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Twould seem the fates have an eye for talent, then!  Sir Simon <i class="calibre3">was</i> a lieutenant for the 1st Order, you know!” returned Emilie, hopping about happily.</p><p class="calibre10">All through to our earliest days, she had always celebrated whatever good fortune found its way to me, as if they were her very own.</p><p class="calibre10">The eldest daughter of House Mernesse, she was.  While a small, yet ennobled family, they held no domain of their own, and it was decided earlier on that she would be wedded to House Buckmann.  Though both houses were headed by barons, the one that owned land was the latter&mdash;the Buckmanns, my own family.</p><p class="calibre10">To put it simply, shining on the horizon was the promise of marriage between us.</p><p class="calibre10">“To think, my beloved husband-to-be is this strong already,” Emilie said after a giggle, “why, I’d burst with pride if I was any prouder!”</p><p class="calibre10">A girl of affection most assertive&mdash;that was the kind of soul Emilie was.  And here was I, flustered in receiving it.</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie…” began my modest answer, “…you’re too kind.”</p><p class="calibre10">For some time now, I had thought to more fully embrace Emilie’s love, but the right words ever fled my lips.</p><p class="calibre10">We were both fifteen, then.  While arranged marriages are a long-held tradition amongst the nobility, it is no strange phenomenon to harbour contempt in having one’s prospective spouse be chosen by others.  For her part&mdash;and by her own admission, no less&mdash;Emilie was pleased to have me as her future husband.</p><p class="calibre10">I suppose I should’ve confessed how thankful I was of her feelings.  Failing to do so was surely an insult to her, but my own words fumbled all too easily.  A coward, I know.  Not the prodigy that others saw me to be.  I wonder what it was that convinced them of such, speaking of which.</p><p class="calibre10">Yes.  That’s right.  ‘Rolf Buckmann, the boy prodigy,’ they’ve always said.  A wunderkind, brave and wise, excellent in myriad things&mdash;or so it seemed.  At the very least, I thought my own courage to be rather scant.</p><p class="calibre10">‘Emilie!  I, too, am proud!  To see your smile with such intimacy; what privilege!  Why, I might go door to door just to boast of it!’</p><p class="calibre10">If I was brave as they say, then surely these words would have been most enthused to leap from my lips.</p><p class="calibre10">While such thoughts thundered through my head, my betrothed continued to gaze intently upon me, and it was then that a voice echoed from a ways behind us.</p><p class="calibre10">“Brother!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Felicia!” I called back, turning about.  “How goes it?”</p><p class="calibre10">There she was: Felicia Buckmann, my younger sibling.  Her locks were long, and like mine, deep and dark like the night.  Our eyes differed, however: where mine were as onyxes, hers were as regal rubies, and the face they bejewelled was an even match for Emilie’s in its beauty.  A most charming sister, if I do say so myself.</p><p class="calibre10">“A berry pie to celebrate your triumph, dear Brother!” said Felicia, settling down beside Emilie and me before unveiling from a basket a pie replete with assorted berries.  Then with deftness, she proceeded to slice out a few wedges.  “One for you as well, Emilie.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh Felicia, it looks wonderful!” exclaimed Emilie, her eyes sparkling with joy.</p><p class="calibre10">“Celebrate my triumph, you say?” I wondered aloud.</p><p class="calibre10">“I heard you bested Sir Simon in a spar.  ‘A dynamic strike from the high guard!’ they all said,” recounted my sister.</p><p class="calibre10">“Did they now?” I returned.  “Well, I should thank you then, Felicia.”</p><p class="calibre10">Against my own heart, I dared not downplay the achievement at that moment.  After all, Felicia was in the habit of baking sweets to commemorate my every deed, little or no.  Not long before, our governess was most taken aback after I discovered an error in a heraldic tome.  For that occasion, Felicia presented to us a plate of gaufrettes&mdash;ah, delectable they were, indeed.  Though the berry pie before me was even more so.</p><p class="calibre10">“A fine pastry you baked for us, Felicia!  The aroma alone is a treat,” I complimented.</p><p class="calibre10">“Truly!” Emilie echoed.</p><p class="calibre10">“I made it with Staffen rum.  Orla told me it works wonders for a pie,” explained Felicia.  Often was she to be found in the kitchen indulging in pursuits of pastry production, and in that process got along very well with the maids and cooks, Orla included.</p><p class="calibre10">“My stomach growls for more.  Spare me another slice, Felicia?”</p><p class="calibre10">“And me!”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m glad ’tis to your likings both,” my sister softly giggled.  “Here you are, then.  Oh, we mustn’t forget the tea.”</p><p class="calibre10">Up the bell-lily hill billowed a balmy breeze.  The three of us were sat there, shoulder to shoulder, our faces beaming from the sour-sweetness of Felicia’s berry pie.  Silly chatter and conjoined laughter chimed through the air.</p><p class="calibre10">“Brother, won’t you regale us with another tale?” my sister requested.</p><p class="calibre10">“A tale?  Hmm, a tale, eh…  How about something I read in a book recently&mdash;one on the relative densities of heavy metals found in knights-wear.”</p><p class="calibre10">“R-Rolf!  That’s more a lullaby than a legend,” Emilie poked.  “How about something more thrilling, let’s say?”</p><p class="calibre10">The land, washed white with lilies-of-the-valley.  The sun, shining softly down upon the three of us.</p><p class="calibre10">“Hmm… right, how’s this?  From the chronicles of a southbound excursion: a creature most rare and riveting.  Does that tickle your curiosities?”</p><p class="calibre10">“It does!  Tell us more!”</p><p class="calibre10">“It’s settled, then.  Let me tell you of a southern specimen&mdash;a critter they call the ‘hippo’…”</p><p class="calibre10">Our childhood brimmed with bliss, and this was but a scene from its last day, one forever enthroned in my memory.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">“Tomorrow’s the big day, Brother.  I hope your nerves aren’t frayed overmuch!”</p><p class="calibre10">A remark from Felicia, made in the midst of our family supper.</p><p class="calibre10">“Hardly&mdash;I can do little, after all, besides let the chips fall where they may.”</p><p class="calibre10">A big day, indeed.</p><p class="calibre10">What awaited on the morrow was the “Roun of Orisons”.</p><p class="calibre10">One might call it a rite of passage.  But to us denizens of this kingdom of Londosius, it is much more: a centuries-old tradition, a divine ritual, a palpable paving of one’s path.  A solemn ceremony officiated by a priest of the Yonaic spirituality, held annually on the fifth month, open to those that have newly celebrated their fifteenth birthdays.  And most do partake in it, for none are turned away on account of status.</p><p class="calibre10">It is said that in the course of these rites, one shall commune with Yoná, the almighty Deiva of our faith, and to Her, bind one’s soul.  Through this bond shall She then share a gift: the grace of <i class="calibre3">odyl.</i> A power above the mundane.  The regenerative spring and store from which magicks are drawn.</p><p class="calibre10">How much is given differs with each recipient.  Most should hope to receive much, for that all but sets in stone the successes of their future endeavours.  Little wonder, then, as to why those many lambs of Yoná find themselves so seized with anxiety on the eve of this most decisive ceremony.</p><p class="calibre10">“I, for one, have little doubt that our very own Rolf shall be blessed with a veritable mountain of odyl,” my mother boasted.  “A great service he’ll do for the Order!  Won’t you, Rolf?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh come, my love.  ‘Twon’t do for our young man to sooner buckle under the mountain of expectation, now would it!” quipped my father.  “Already is he prodigious in matters of book and blade both.  Nevermind a mountain&mdash;a mere mound suffices, for he’ll flourish just the same.”</p><p class="calibre10">High praise from my parents, their faces fast abeam.</p><p class="calibre10">“Listen well, Rolf,” said my father, turning to me.  “No doubt the generosity of Yoná’s gift will prove crucial, but let it not fray you so.  Of greatest account is that through the Roun of Orisons, you commune with Yoná Herself, and thereby with Her, birth a new bond.  Keep this in your heart!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Of course, Lord Father.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hm, very good.  And while you’re at it, why not brush up on the Rounic scriptures?” my father continued.  “You’re well-versed in them, I know, but oft is there something to be gleaned from re-treading a trodden path, especially that of a saint’s.”</p><p class="calibre10">“That I will,” heeded I his counsel.  And once supper was finished, I did just that, dutifully heading over to the manor study.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>

<p class="calibre10">Six centuries past, there lived a saint by the name of Rakliammelech.  From the empyrean on high, he received the Revelation, and thereupon was enlightened of the Roun&mdash;a miracle most hallowed, the workings of godly hands and godly thought.  Through it could the souls of Man be bound to Yoná, and by Her grace attain the gift of odyl.</p><p class="calibre10">A story known to any and all in this kingdom, recounted in the book I now took to hand.  Scriptures telling of the lore of the Roun of Orisons&mdash;in the corner of the study, I opened its familiar pages, and, by my father’s earlier insistence, committed myself to reading through the familiar tale.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>

<p class="calibre10">Rakliammelech was then a youth in his prime, and most compassionate.  He cared for his mother&mdash;frail-legged, she was&mdash;and together they lived in a settlement nestled within  the vales.</p><p class="calibre10">Once upon a time, under the noontide sun, young Rakliammelech was busy afore his home, tending to his field.  It was then that into the settlement, they came&mdash;the <i class="calibre3">Nafílim.</i></p><p class="calibre10">His mother, weak of legs as she was, hobbled and could hardly suffer a hasty flight, and so Rakliammelech, gripped with desperation, took hoe in hand and went to scatter the invading Nafílim.  Though try as he might, the young man’s bark was worse than his bite.  No sooner was he skewered with spears, left to prostrate and perish whence he once stood.</p><p class="calibre10">Hours wound by.  Rakliammelech lifted the lids over his eyes.  By some miracle was his life spared&mdash;but as he would come to know, it was a miracle ill-shared.  Before him was his mother, hewn to pieces, her human shape far forgotten.</p><p class="calibre10">A death of unspeakable cruelty, handed down to his only bloodkin left in the land&mdash;the very sight of it sent the son into a howling fit of despair.  His wounds unwound themselves, basting his body in blood with none he shared any longer.</p><p class="calibre10">From then on, poor Rakliammelech committed much of his days to prayer.  He tended to the fields, but only to reap the least of what would sustain him.  Any other hour found him beside a great tree, praying to the gods.</p><p class="calibre10">In those olden days, Yoná was not worshipped as the sole deity, for throughout the lands, men practised each their own native faiths.  For his part, Rakliammelech was ill-apprised of the gods, and knew neither to whom he should pray nor how.  Nonetheless, he could not bear the thought of leaving his mother’s soul to linger on unsoothed.</p><p class="calibre10">Was she given to this “heaven”, as they called it?  Or did her destination lie elsewhere?  The answers were lost to Rakliammelech, but what wasn’t was his desire to bring about a peace where none would have further need to suffer.</p><p class="calibre10">And he could no longer deny the great yearning for grace with which to smite the Nafílim and undo their coil of misery.  For they were Unreason itself, with lightning immediacy trampling those who aspired to little more than living their lives in harmony.  The meek must resist, undauntedly, unfailingly&mdash;of how, he wished to know.</p><p class="calibre10">So it was that day by day, Rakliammelech persevered in his prayers beside that great tree, the most magnificent of all the trees he knew and within which he envisioned a godly presence.  ‘Better to rise up in arms than wallow in prayer,’ rebutted none, for in their despair against the terrible might of the Nafílim, men had made cowards of themselves.  What was left to Rakliammelech, then, was nothing but prayer.</p><p class="calibre10">Through days of snow swollen high, he prayed.  Through days of screaming storms, he prayed.  Through days of seething heat, he prayed&mdash;on and on, unmoving and unbending, prayers bereft of their erstwhile serenity.</p><p class="calibre10">Scarcer numbered the days that found him upon the field.  Prayer became his life, consuming him for days on end, during which he eschewed all sleep and sustenance.  His figure paid the toll, now too frightful to be rightfully that of a saint’s, it was said.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>
<p class="calibre10">Having read up to that point, I pried my eyes away from the text on a whim, finding Felicia coming into the study.</p><p class="calibre10">“There you are!” she called, smiling as our eyes met.</p><p class="calibre10">“Found me, I see.  Here am I to indulge in the scriptures again, just as Father bade me do.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And I bid you retire soon for the night, Brother.  You’ve such an important day tomorrow, yet I was worried you might still be cooped up in the study, as you are like to do for hours on end.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You’re very kind, Felicia.  Thank you,” I returned, “and good night.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh…  Yes, of course.  Good night, dear Brother,” she almost stammered, before taking leave of the study.</p><p class="calibre10">It would seem Felicia wished to chat a while more, and if so, I’ve done her a disservice.  But it was in believing it would not do to interrupt her brother’s literary duties that she left with such haste.</p><p class="calibre10">Warmed by my sister’s thoughtfulness, I turned my eyes back to the book.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">And then one day, at long last, came the Revelation.  In the recesses of Rakliammelech’s mind, there spoke a voice, intermittent, but infinitely warm and profound.</p><p class="calibre2">“…cheth… thi…<br class="calibre6" /> Hark… dost My voice reacheth thine ears?”</p><p class="calibre10">Right away, the young man sensed it to be the words of the divine.  He knew not why, only, his conviction had convinced him so.</p><p class="calibre2">“O son of Man, by thy Mercy<br class="calibre6" /> so gaol’d in durance of Prayer.<br class="calibre6" /> Lo, by My god-some name, Yoná,<br class="calibre6" /> this Roun, veil’d myst, thou art receipt.”</p><p class="calibre10">Rakliammelech then felt an unknowable flow coursing into him, and in that moment, there took form within him knowledge by which to link the soul to the Deiva Herself: the “Roun”, as She so called it.</p><p class="calibre2">“To thine own kin, pray bequeathest this Roun…<br class="calibre6" /> To the Wicked, dread-lorn… barest thy Fangs…”</p><p class="calibre10">Then did the voice begin to wane.</p><p class="calibre2">“O son of Man… pray, by Strength of thy kin,<br class="calibre6" /> redeemest the World… of Ages Pass’d…”</p><p class="calibre10">Quietude returned.</p><p class="calibre10">At the foot of the great tree, Rakliammelech slowly rose.  He felt then how alike the divine voice was to his late mother’s own.</p><p class="calibre10">From then on, the saint, newly enlightened, wandered throughout and sojourned in the disparate lands, conferring the Roun to his fellow man.  Through it, the wayward folk employed magicks to protect both their homes and their own lives.</p><p class="calibre10">In return, Rakliammelech was shown deep gratitude indeed, and was even offered coin and prestige, but abstinently did he refuse them all.  By his words, thanks should be given to Yoná, for he was merely Her messenger and mediator.</p><p class="calibre10">The saint eventually came into Death’s embrace, and thereafter the apostles who loved both him and the Deiva founded the Yonaic faith.  Knowledge of the Roun, itself the rites by which to commune with Yoná, was preserved in earnest, and the nascent Yonaic spirituality devoted itself to conferring it to the kin of Man.  It was then that these rites came to be known as the Roun of Orisons.</p><p class="calibre10">The apostles, on account of the burden borne of having one’s soul bound to a god, also ruled that the Roun of Orisons be carried out for those at least fifteen years of age.  So it was that the apostles continued to confer it to the kin of Man all throughout the lands, granting them strength.</p><p class="calibre10">In time, resistance against the Nafílim came to be institutionalised.  Cities were built.  Realms were born.  Of note was Rakliammelech’s own homeland, whereupon the foundations of Londosius were laid.  What grew from it would become the grandest of all the realms of Man.</p><p class="calibre10">And so, as they say, the rest was history.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">“…Well, that’s that,” I sighed, closing the scriptures.</p><p class="calibre10">The Roun of Orisons.</p><p class="calibre10">On the morrow would it receive me and many others alike.  And there, we would together attain odyl, the power to fight the Nafílim&mdash;they who so bear ill intent towards our kind.  They who commit ill deeds upon our meek and defenceless.  They, who from birth are each instilled with powerful odyl of their own.</p><p class="calibre10">It is said that in ages long gone, men were bereft of odyl and could do little against the Nafílim but be overrun by them.  St. Rakliammelech’s feats six hundred years past, however, brought odyl into the hands of Men at long last.  With it, they faced the Nafílim&mdash;an effort that continued on through the centuries.</p><p class="calibre10">Here in this kingly realm of Londosius, any of whom are received at the Roun of Orisons are also qualified to serve in the Chivalric Order.  Nobles in particular are keen on this, with no small number conscripting into the Order as soon as they are able.</p><p class="calibre10">The kingdom itself is founded upon the congregations of resistance against the Nafílim.  As such, the nobility sees itself honour-bound to join the fight.  Emilie and I were no different&mdash;we both planned to enlist together.</p><p class="calibre10">It is scarcely the case that the sons and daughters of nobility are sent to theatres of war deemed perilous overmuch.  Serve the Order for a number of years, receive the rites of investiture, gain a degree of combat experience, and then return home to one’s domain&mdash;such is the career laid out for us young nobles.  To those of our station, there is otherwise little reason to join the Order.</p><p class="calibre10">But I thought differently.</p><p class="calibre10">For as long as I can remember, the legends of chivalric gallantry were and are a great fascination to me, so much so that I came to harbour dreams of donning the knight’s mantle myself.  It is for that very reason that I’ve honed my swordsmanship more doggedly than any other I knew.</p><p class="calibre10">The time would come someday when the reins of this little corner of Londosius would pass to my hands, though thankfully, my father was yet hale in his health.  Knighthood is my ambition, and it is my aim to remain a knight for as long as I can.</p><p class="calibre10">And of course, there’s Emilie.  I dare not leave her out of the picture.  Apparently, there are nobles who’ve wedded in the midst of their military service.  A precedent of comfort, for I intend to propose to her sometime before I am made lord to this barony.  And after fulfilling my dreams and becoming a man that even I can be proud of, I would set out for my homecoming.</p><p class="calibre10">Such is my wish.  Such is my hope.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>
<p class="calibre10">“Today’s the day, Rolf!  Let’s give it our all!” Emilie cheered, her hands clenched with determination.  We were gathered before the Buckmann manor as our carriage was making ready.</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m afraid our ‘all’ amounts to little, Emilie,” I remarked.  “Kneel before the Reverend, close our eyes, and it’s done before we know it.”</p><p class="calibre10">And rightfully so, for the one officiating the Roun of Orisons was the priest, after all, and it was his shoulders that would bear the work.</p><p class="calibre10">“But wouldn’t it be nice to let Yoná know of our ardour?  Surely She’ll answer in kind!” my fiancée countered.</p><p class="calibre10">“I say Emilie has a point, Brother.  I’ll be coming to watch your heroic performance myself, so pray give your all to earn Her grace,” said Felicia, with a firm mind in accompanying us to the church.  But with so heavy a word like ‘heroic,’ I feared my own mind was aught but firm.</p><p class="calibre10">“Performance, you say?  Well… if you insist, Felicia,” I relented.  “For you, I’ll put on my best act.”</p><p class="calibre10">“One worthy of ovation, I should hope!” smiled Felicia.  “After the curtains close, ‘twill be long before we next meet.  ‘Twould please me to have one more memory of you for the while, Brother…”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie and I had arrangements to enlist in the 5th Chivalric Order very soon after the closing of the Roun of Orisons.  Its base of operations stood in the march of Norden, a province neighbouring the royal capital, and our departure for the march was scheduled on the day after the ceremony proper.</p><p class="calibre10">A trip between the Buckmann barony and our destination in Norden was not in and of itself a particularly long journey, but nor was it one to be taken at leisure.</p><p class="calibre10">“Though you’ll be enlisting yourself, won’t you Felicia?  In the coming year, that is,” I asked.  “We’ll keep a seat warm for you.”</p><p class="calibre10">“That’s right, Felicia!  A year passes before you know it!”</p><p class="calibre10">“My hope that it shall.  I’ll be chasing your heels, you two!”</p><p class="calibre10">Warm smiles were shared between us.</p><p class="calibre10">“And how about you, Rolf?” Emilie asked, turning to me.  “Knighthood’s right on the horizon at last, isn’t it!”</p><p class="calibre10">“The same horizon we both look upon, no?”</p><p class="calibre10">“True, but I’m hardly the one who’s been dreaming of it for, what, ten years now, it’s been?  Why, the wait’s almost over, Rolf!”</p><p class="calibre10">“I share in Emilie’s thoughts, Brother.  For such a momentous occasion, you seem the tree unswayed by the merry winds.”</p><p class="calibre10">That my dream alone gave spark to these girls’ gazes was most endearing indeed.</p><p class="calibre10">“A year of swainhood comes first; we’ll be as saplings toiling against winds of a different temperament, I’m afraid.  Once we’ve taken firm root, though, we must ply ourselves till we’ve earned our investitures,” I explained.  “I’ve no doubt it’s on the horizon, but the distance spans more deeply than we’d like.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh Brother, you’ve only to receive your accolade right as the second year opens.  Then you’ll be a proud knight by the time I’m a swain myself!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Felicia’s on to something!  We should celebrate both milestones at once!  Together, of course!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Now, you two.  Didn’t I just say it wasn’t going to be that easy…?”</p><p class="calibre10">A fretful shade hung in my heart, I admit, but thanks to the girls, I felt its mists lift as the carriage wended its way close, ready to whisk us off.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">Solemnity draped the church more palpably than usual.</p><p class="calibre10">Forgathered within were children from all corners of the Buckmann barony, each having celebrated their fifteenth birthdays this year.  A shared tension tugged at each of their faces as they lined down the nave.</p><p class="calibre10">Further in loomed a statue of our Deiva, Yoná.  Framed by a pane of stained glass from behind, She cast a grave gaze down upon us all.  At Her likeness’ base stood the priest, flanked by a pair of knights&mdash;personnel from the 5th Order, the same we were to enlist in.  Their twofold charge was to act as the priest’s bodyguards and to survey the odyl of prospective recruits.</p><p class="calibre10">“Well met and congratulations, all of you,” greeted the priest.  “For fifteen years has Yoná kept you in Her safe embrace.  Those fifteen years find you here now, ready for the rites, ready for the new path ahead of you.  Praises, all, to Yoná.”</p><p class="calibre10">What followed was a narration of the story of St. Rakliammelech.  How he suffered the malice of the Nafílim, realised the cruelty of the world, and communed with Yoná&mdash;all passionately recounted to us so gathered.</p><p class="calibre10">“To that end, only for that which is good and just must you employ the gift of odyl&mdash;the same to be bestowed upon each of you on this day.”</p><p class="calibre10">All those present had their eyes and ears fixed to the priest’s sermon in great earnest.  Glancing over, I found Emilie’s profile to be no less seized by the solemnity.</p><p class="calibre10">“Henceforth shall we commence the Roun of Orisons.  Pray mind your order.”</p><p class="calibre10">Our nerves collectively frayed further.</p><p class="calibre10">Up ahead, a youth was summoned forth.  To the transept he went, with steps unsteady with worriment.  Once there, he was, from the priest, presented with a satin cloth, nestled within which was a crystal, clear and of quartz.  Taking it, the adolescent then knelt down and closed his eyes.  There, the priest raised a palm to him, and with a sonorous voice, began to chant.</p><p class="calibre10">“O Yoná, Deiva Suprēma, Aegis of Man from the Empyrean on high.  Here, we adjureth Thee, Most Divine, of Thy Grace, that we may dammeth the tides of the Wicked, and answereth the entreaty of sons and daughters of Man set adrift.”</p><p class="calibre10">As the psalm finished, a deep blue glow sighed from the quartz in the boy’s hands.  In turn, he slowly opened his eyes and gazed at length into the crystalline light.  And once it had faded, the priest spoke again.</p><p class="calibre10">“It is done.  May Yoná’s blessing find you, my son.”</p><p class="calibre10">The next person stepped up as the youth turned and walked back down the nave.  Despite having received odyl, he seemed visibly dejected, and rightfully so.</p><p class="calibre10">The measure of odyl bestowed is decided by the depth of the quartz-light’s blue colour.  To put it simply, the paler the light, the more odyl one is bestowed, and it is said that a light of sky-blue hue is a most excellent result indeed.</p><p class="calibre10">For the boy, his was of a morose shine, like sunrays drifting in the ocean depths, a dark light indicating that odyl of no appreciable amount was given to him.  His drooping shoulders, then, seemed quite justified.</p><p class="calibre10">The Roun of Orisons proceeded further without trouble, granting odyl to each of us in turn.  The responses were mixed&mdash;some radiated with elation for their results, others slumped in defeat.</p><p class="calibre10">“Next: Emilie Mernesse.  Pray come forth.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Y-yes, Reverend!  R-right away!” she stammered, before turning to me.  “Rolf!  Off I go!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Calm your nerves first, lest your feet stammer as well,” I said back with levity.</p><p class="calibre10">Taking her turn, Emilie marched forth to the transept.  Like so many others before her, she, too, took up the quartz crystal, knelt down, and held it close to her heart.  Her fingers clasped tightly about it, almost as if it embodied the whole of Yonaism itself.</p><p class="calibre10">The priest’s palm then reached out towards her forehead, whilst Emilie kept both eyes squeezed shut, betraying in them a slight quiver.</p><p class="calibre10">“O Yoná, Deiva Suprēma, Aegis of Man from the Empyrean on high.  Here, we adjureth Thee, Most Divine, of Thy Grace, that we may dammeth the tides of the Wicked, and answereth the entreaty of sons and daughters of Man set adrift.”</p><p class="calibre10">A glimmer began to enshroud the quartz, as if on cue.  Emilie opened her eyes nervously, but instead, found it impossible to look&mdash;the quartz was as the sun itself, luminous and dazzling.  A beacon of pure white, its rays reaching up to set the vaults aglint, and down through the nave, shimmering against our faces, striking into our eyes.</p><p class="calibre10">The priest and the knights were taken aback, their faces stretched in shock.  Ill-bearing the brimming shine, I winced and turned away for a moment, there finding the same expression of awe in all the spectators along the aisle and narthex both.  Amongst them was Felicia, herself frozen in utter astonishment.</p><p class="calibre10">Moments later did the dawn-like luminosity begin to subside.  And upon its eventual vanishing, the officiators found their wits and broke into discussion.</p><p class="calibre10">“Reverend… That light…!  Was it not wholly pale just now…?” observed one of the knights.  “If memory serves, such brilliance would mean the fullest measure of odyl has been given&mdash; ‘Aureola’, the halo-light, as it were?”</p><p class="calibre10">“It… It would seem so!  Many years have I officiated this solemn ceremony, but this be the first mine eyes have beheld such a light!” exclaimed the priest.  “Miss Emilie, yes?  Oh!  Bless your soul, child!  Yoná embraces you with Her most profound love!”</p><p class="calibre10">An invigourated murmur arose through the church.</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie Mernesse!” approached one of the knights.  “Do tell: you mean to join the Order, yes!?  Surely!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Y-yes, sir.  I-I do.”</p><p class="calibre10">All eyes in the church were then trained upon Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">“And you felt the odyl manifest within you, yes?” asked the other knight.</p><p class="calibre10">“I-I did, sir, yes.  From within my chest, I sensed something… something tinged with heat, come coursing in.”</p><p class="calibre10">“In all the history of the 5th Chivalric Order, none till today have produced the Aureola!  Be proud, for you hold the greatest odyl of any recruit to this very moment!  We welcome you, Emilie Mernesse!  We welcome you with open arms!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Th-thank you, good sirs!”</p><p class="calibre10">After enduring a long while of exaltation from the officiators, Emilie came back my way, her cheeks fully ablush.</p><p class="calibre10">“R-Rolf…!” she gasped excitedly.</p><p class="calibre10">“Congratulations, Emilie!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Th-thanks!  Good luck to you too, Rolf!”</p><p class="calibre10">Between us was brimming mirth, till echoed the priest’s voice once more.</p><p class="calibre10">“Next: Rolf Buckmann.  To the fore, if you may.”</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">Summoned so by the priest, I stepped up to the transept.  Repeating the actions of my precedents, I received the quartz crystal, knelt, and closed my eyes.  Once more, the holy man’s psalm resounded through the church.</p><p class="calibre10">“O Yoná, Deiva Suprēma, Aegis of Man from the Empyrean on high.  Here, we adjureth Thee, Most Divine, of Thy Grace, that we may dammeth the tides of the Wicked, and answereth the entreaty of sons and daughters of Man set adrift.”</p><p class="calibre10">Then…</p>
<p class="calibre10">Silence.</p>
<p class="calibre10">And naught.</p>
<p class="calibre10">The air was stilled.  Breaths were bated.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet, there manifested nothing at all within my bosom.  The quartz, too, remained wholly immuted.</p><p class="calibre10">“…O Yoná, Deiva Suprēma, Aegis of Man from the Empyrean on high.  Here, we adjureth Thee, Most Divine, of Thy Grace, that we may dammeth the tides of the Wicked, and answereth the entreaty of sons and daughters of Man set adrift,” the priest repeated diligently.  Try as he might, no change came about the crystal.</p><p class="calibre10">“Reverend…”  whispered one of the knights, “…what’s this…?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I… I know not.  This should not be possible,” returned the priest.  “…O-oh Yoná, Deiva Suprēma, Aegis of Man from the Empyrean on high!  Here, we adjureth Thee, Most Divine, of Thy Grace, that we may dammeth the tides of the Wicked!  And answereth the entreaty of sons and daughters of Man set adrift!”</p><p class="calibre10">A third attempt.  A third failure.</p><p class="calibre10">“…What… what <i class="calibre3">preposterousness…!”</i> our Reverend relented.  “Young man.  I now know a fear in me.  A fear that Yoná, the Deiva Suprēma, has graced you not of Her gift of odyl.”</p><p class="calibre10">Upon hearing the priest’s words, the knights were seized by a surprise of a different sort.</p><p class="calibre10">“Why, has there ever been such a thing, Reverend?  To be given naught?”</p><p class="calibre10">“…Writ in our history, it is not, I’m afraid.  Though Her grace of odyl varies in measure, it is heretofore a gift always given.”</p><p class="calibre10">“But what of <i class="calibre3">reason,</i> Reverend?”</p><p class="calibre10">A shake of the head.</p><p class="calibre10">“I… I have not the answer.  Were it merely that the light was unthinkably faint… but this, too, I fear, was not so.  While sore incredulous, Yoná’s ways are mysterious.  Thus I can only surmise…” the priest reasoned, his brows furrowing at me as if beholding something most alien, “…that this wayward lamb is lost to Her blessing.”</p><p class="calibre10">I dared not dwell upon the matter.</p><p class="calibre10">Instead, I took in the weight of those words, rose up, and turned back.  There was I met with Emilie and Felicia, struck and silent out of all their wits.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">“…Rolf Buckmann…”</p><p class="calibre10">I stared on through the window from my room.</p><p class="calibre10">“…the man ungraced…”</p><p class="calibre10">In the high yonder, skies were awash with an evenlight drabber and more dreary than those of days past.  Home was never so heavy.</p><p class="calibre10">Our return trip from the rites bore a like weight, for nary a word was aired between Emilie, Felicia, and I.</p><p class="calibre10">Never do I make myself the sort to be bothered by mere silence, but today was different: enduring the two’s reticence required tangible effort.  From time to time, I had sensed the girls looking my way, their eyes darkened with both woe and worry.  What words to say, which wordless moment to break&mdash;all seemed lost to them.</p><p class="calibre10">Not that any blame was to be found in them.  Our Reverend said it himself: never has such misfortune befallen upon a Londosian in all the history of this realm.  Indeed, to be bereft of odyl is clearly an aberration.  Its absence brands one as being nigh powerless in battle; a stigma, then, for we kin of Man have long been at war with the Nafílim.</p><p class="calibre10">Though they be our enemy of many centuries, they are unlike us humans in scant ways.  They foster culture, share our appearance, our language&mdash;the sole difference that immediately strikes the eye is the tawny colour of their skin.</p><p class="calibre10">But what sets us apart most notably is not to be found without, but within: the strength native to their flesh.  While we progeny of Man must attain odyl through divine ritual, a Nafíl is instilled with the treasured force from the moment of his conception.  And with it, he and many brethren arm themselves with affrighting magicks, well-earning their place as a most terrible foe.</p><p class="calibre10">Fighting fire with fire was the chosen path for Men&mdash;we, too, came to wield the same odyl against the Nafílim.  A magicked defence best wards off a magicked offence.  Similarly, only a magicked offence can break through a magicked defence.  Without this supernatural succour, Men are as lambs left to the slaughter.</p><p class="calibre10">The Chivalric Orders themselves are founded upon this very basis, honing their knights in all manner of magicked combat.  So it is that those who lack odyl lack the means to fight the Nafílim.  It follows, then, that such impotence would be most unwelcome in the knightly institution.  Of course, for a man to be “odylless” is heretofore an unthinkable occurrence, but there was no doubt in my mind that such a man, powerless as he is, would find no comfort wherever he may wander, let alone the hallowed halls of the Orders.</p><p class="calibre10">Always have I longed to become a knight.</p><p class="calibre10">But the grace of odyl has spurned me.  I am that “odylless” man, lacking that which the knights hold to be most precious: the power to fight.</p><p class="calibre10">What, then, could I do?</p><p class="calibre10">“…Rather vain, I admit, to ponder on like this,” I muttered again.</p><p class="calibre10">Right.</p><p class="calibre10">I would join the Order, just as planned.</p><p class="calibre10">Knighthood forever eludes me otherwise.  No matter how meagre my chances, so long as the light of luck itself is not snuffed out, so long as I yet have the will to keep pursuing my knightly dreams, I can do little else but cast the dice.  Besides, there are other avenues to apply my mettle in battle, even without odyl; say, the extermination of the behemót vermin.</p><p class="calibre10">What’s more, the Order is hardly the only place in these lands that measures the worth of a man by his odyl.  Thus the barony itself affords no safe haven for an aberration like me, who has no odyl to begin with.  And with things as they are, inheriting the Buckmann estate is out of the question.</p><p class="calibre10">Here on the barony…</p><p class="calibre10">…or there in the Order.</p><p class="calibre10">What my future lacks in choices, it brims with blame and censure.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Such friction might be the least of my worries, I fear….”</p><p class="calibre10">Of course, to be denied odyl is to be denied by the divine.  Yoná’s forsaken child, as it were, for whom awaits nothing better than despisal, derision, and discrimination.  What foul a turn my life has taken…</p><p class="calibre10">Only&mdash;</p><p class="calibre10">“I yet have my sword.”</p><p class="calibre10">Sharp iron mirrored the thinning twilight&mdash;in my hands, my trusty blade, the sole companion in all the toils of my training.  Used through and through, its patina was riddled with scuffs and scratches, yet by my unfailing care, the weapon was kept most serviceable.</p><p class="calibre10">Yes.  The sword may yet avail me.  I can still wield it, ungraced as I am.  I would further ply my technique in the Order, and fight by the sword.  And then, I would become a knight.</p><p class="calibre10">This I swore upon my very heart.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">With the setting of the sun came the hour for supper.</p><p class="calibre10">Only, not a single servant came to bid my presence, as per usual.  Worried, I went down to the dining hall, finding my parents and Felicia in the wordless midst of supping.</p><p class="calibre10">Neither Father nor Mother spared a single glance my way.  For her part, my sister found the impulse to do so, but just once, and only before immediately turning her gaze down to her plate.  It was then that I noticed my chair wholly missing from the room.</p><p class="calibre10">From behind approached one of our servants.</p><p class="calibre10">“This way.”</p><p class="calibre10">Obliging, I followed him to the kitchen.  The other servants, let alone the cooks, were absent therein; no more meals would be prepared for the rest of the night.  But there, set unceremoniously upon the counter was a smattering of food: black bread and a bowl of soup conjured from vegetable scraps.  To them the servant pointed, and then went about his way without a word.</p><p class="calibre10">Before the counter was a wooden box&mdash;my new “chair”, from the look of it.</p><p class="calibre10">“A meal with all the trimmings.  Fancy that,” came my hollow quipping.  “More than I could’ve hoped for, if I’m honest.”</p><p class="calibre10">Sat upon the box, I grabbed the stiff black bread and tore off a morsel.  Into the soup it went before I endeavoured a bite of it.  Not too terrible.  Who could’ve imagined that the combination of cold, hard bread and tasteless soup was a match made in heaven?</p><p class="calibre10">My chewing stopped.  I stared into the bowl.</p><p class="calibre10">This sort of treatment was to be my reality from now on.</p><p class="calibre10">That’s to say nothing of the Order; I would sooner rouse some magicks of my own than be welcomed more warmly than a sickly cur there.</p><p class="calibre10">Indeed.  Even a cur has its place, unlike a man unloved by the Deiva.  An intruder upon Her cherished land.  An alien ailing Her flesh.  A mistake within Her machinations.  A good-for-nothing to be disdained&mdash;that was I, Rolf, the ungraced.</p><p class="calibre10">I resolved to accustom myself to such treatment.  For meals even, I would partake of aught I am accorded, no matter how crude the menu.  I was yet growing; to deprive my body of sustenance now would leave it stunted and fain to fail me in a future battle.</p><p class="calibre10">Silently, then, I took up another scrap of bread and pushed it into my mouth.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">Supper was done with.</p><p class="calibre10">In the dimly lamp-lit kitchen I remained, still sat upon the box, arms folded.  Up to the ceiling I then gazed.  My thoughts turned to my family, now fractured by the day’s happenings.</p><p class="calibre10">That I would be treated this way falls well within my expectations, but one small matter did not: I sense little in the way of anger or sorrow from my parents.</p><p class="calibre10">Thinking upon it now, the warmth of our familial bond is, all through to my most faded memories, not especially warm at all.  I am, to them, a progeny of potential.  A fine cog in the Buckmann machinery.</p><p class="calibre10">But never a <i class="calibre3">son.</i></p><p class="calibre10">A heavy cloud of an epiphany it is, one that settled in not recently, but during the course of my tinier years.  Murkily.  Steadily.</p><p class="calibre10">Of course, no parent should be so blamed for fixing at least one eye upon his child’s future promise.  Only, the eyes of my own parents are all bespectacled by the jealous lenses of “self-interest”, as it were.</p><p class="calibre10">Who they need is not “Rolf”, but an able heir to House Buckmann&mdash;a cold conclusion, I admit, but one I somehow settled upon regardless.</p><p class="calibre10">“No…  Perhaps I read too deeply.”</p><p class="calibre10">Or perhaps this situation had taken its toll, and my thoughts couldn’t help but turn to negativity, turbid as they were with cowardice, self-resentment, and resignation.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet my plight is grave.  That much is true.</p><p class="calibre10">Truer still is the influence of one’s environs: deep as it is inescapable.  But discrimination is as a cage, sapping all hale that might give growth to one’s character.  A cage that now very well surrounds me.</p><p class="calibre10">The laws of Londosius hold the age of fifteen to be the dawn of one’s adulthood, and it is at this same age that one can enlist in the Order at the earliest.  But let there be no doubt that one’s heart is yet immature at this unripened age.  Thus, even after reaching adulthood must the heart be allowed to mature further yet.  The Order, too, exists for this purpose.</p><p class="calibre10">Let there also be no doubt, then, that to live in such a space, where one is so harried by malice from others, one would surely be impaired by no small degree.</p><p class="calibre10">Those who are hurt time after time eventually come to fear all too much the thought of being hurt yet again, and so does the integrity of their character begin to shrivel.  They fret over the words and conduct of others, seek stagnancy when their hearts desire action, and ever avert their eyes from the gaze of society.</p><p class="calibre10">All too often have I witnessed this for myself in others.  And now, the fates deign to count me amongst those pitiable droves by throwing me into the same misery that produced them.</p><p class="calibre10">This, I will not abide.</p><p class="calibre10">But to brave the breaking and battering winds, I must, at all costs, keep myself from falling apart.</p><p class="calibre10">“Through discipline, temper thyself,’ was it now?”</p><p class="calibre10">My lips bent into a wearied simper.  I realised then just how given fifteen year-olds are to feigning wisdom.</p><p class="calibre10">Shaking my head, I rose up to make my way back to my room, only to find a figure standing at the kitchen doorway.</p><p class="calibre10">“Dear Brother…” came her quiet, quivering words.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p></div>

<p class="calibre10">“Felicia,” I called to my sister.</p><p class="calibre10">A look was upon her face&mdash;one that I’d seen her make never once before.  I thought then, how hers seemed the sort of gaze to be given at the last breath of a loved one, or at the embers of one’s burning home.  I then, too, came to share in her sorrow, as none other than the brother who caused his own sister such suffering.</p><p class="calibre10">And it was behind that sister of mine that the shadow of my parents then appeared.</p><p class="calibre10">“Felicia,” Father said.  “Look not upon that <i class="calibre3">thing.”</i></p><p class="calibre10">“Do heed your father, Felicia dear,” added Mother.  “Consort with traitors to the Deiva and you are like to share in their filth.”</p><p class="calibre10">To such sharp words, Felicia did little but quietly set her eyes downward.  Seeing the futility of any conversation to be had, I strode past the three without a word.</p><p class="calibre10">“Hold,” my father threw at my back.  “Heirship of the Buckmann name falls to Felicia.  Know this, and <i class="calibre3">keep it.”</i></p><p class="calibre10">“Aye,” was my curt answer.  I continued on to my room without sparing them a look back.</p><p class="calibre10">“Felicia shall not be made to suffer your presence from this day forth,” warned my mother.  “Understood?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I do.”</p><p class="calibre10">It was one thing to be branded a man unblessed by the Deiva.  It was another to be a son who betrayed the single most important hope of a noble house: succession.</p><p class="calibre10">Little wonder then, why the words uttered by Mother and Father alike so oozed with both enmity and discontent.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">That next day.</p><p class="calibre10">The day of our long-awaited departure.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie and I were to set off by carriage from the Buckmann abode.  Her parents and servants all were gathered to send her off.</p><p class="calibre10">Long possessed of a mirthful magnetism, Emilie had gotten along well with even her servants.  To point, a veritable crowd had come to celebrate.</p><p class="calibre10">Amongst them was a very young handmaiden of House Mernesse by the name of Maria, whom Emilie thoroughly adored.  The little girl had her hands clasped about Emilie’s, prattling to her mistress with the eagerness of a songbird at sunrise.</p><p class="calibre10">The Baron Mernesse and his wife, for their part, then held their daughter in a tight embrace.  Word had already spread of the Aureola, indicating Emilie’s receipt of the fullest gift of odyl, and her parents naturally were well-apprised of this.  Their eyes were reddened from shedding tears, but brimmed no less brightly with pride.</p><p class="calibre10">The same could not be said of the Buckmanns.</p><p class="calibre10">While present for the departure, Mother and Father kept silent, sparing me only looks bitter and cold.  It seemed they meant not to see me off, but rather to make certain I had well and truly left.</p><p class="calibre10">I turned to board the carriage, but then, for the briefest moment, stopped.</p><p class="calibre10">Fifteen years.</p><p class="calibre10">For fifteen years, I’d lived on this estate.</p><p class="calibre10">Fifteen years, each filled with bliss.</p><p class="calibre10">Nothing but fond memories composed the collective childhoods Emilie, Felicia, and I shared together.  How unfortunate that the day I take wing from the nest would be this dreary.  Unfortunate again, that I could not see myself ever returning.</p><p class="calibre10">With such turbid emotions roiling within me, I looked up at the Buckmann manor, spotting in one of the windows a lonesome silhouette.</p><p class="calibre10">Felicia.</p><p class="calibre10">From high up in her room, she watched on.</p><p class="calibre10">I returned a look of my own, as if to say ‘sorry’.  After all, a new burden now pressed upon her shoulders, what with the heirship of the Buckmann estate having been passed asudden to her.</p><p class="calibre10">My sister, however, is an exceptional soul.  Light work she’ll make of this new trial, I’m sure.</p><p class="calibre10">The air clapped, sharply, dryly,&mdash;the sound of Mother’s hand slapping her son across his face.</p><p class="calibre10">“Don’t you <i class="calibre3">dare</i> even look at Felicia,” she hissed.  “Our dear heir has suffered your profane gaze long enough!  Have you no shame!?”</p><p class="calibre10">“…My apologies.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You held such promise…!  Where’s it gone…? <i class="calibre3">Where…!?”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Her voice quivered as tears welled from her eyes.  Dearly and tenderly had she loved her son, certain in the brilliant days ahead of him.  But then came that son’s betrayal.  At the very least, that was how she and Father must’ve felt.</p><p class="calibre10">Nay.  Certainly, given the common thought of this kingdom, anyone else would feel the same.</p><p class="calibre10">Father then embraced Mother by her quaking shoulders.</p><p class="calibre10">“Felicia enters the Order in the coming year,” he began.  “You will <i class="calibre3">not</i> meddle with her.  Not in the slightest.  Do you understand?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, I do,” I answered, boarding the carriage.  “Be well, then.”</p><p class="calibre10">A farewell unreturned.  As I thought.</p><p class="calibre10">Not long after, the carriage departed in earnest.  The crowd, the manor, the memories, the familial fetters&mdash;all shrank into the distance behind me as the ride wheeled down the estate avenue.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie and I.</p><p class="calibre10">What awaited at the end of the long road before us both was the 5th Chivalric Order’s headquarters.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“…Disinherited!?”</i></p><p class="calibre10">“That I was.”</p><p class="calibre10">Well were we on our way, the end of an hour finding us on the highroads through the Buckmann countryside.  But between Emilie and I, the better part of that long while was spent in silence, one broken only after her cup of patience had seemingly overflowed.  The stammering conversation that ensued centred on what else but the happenings of the night before.</p><p class="calibre10">My future claim to the headship of the Buckmann estate was wrested away&mdash;a ”disinheritance”, as it were.  Divested of all promised investment…  An ill tiding that left Emilie in no mild shock when it finally met her ears.</p><p class="calibre10">“A… a-are you sure that’s what he meant?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Clear as day, Father’s words were.  ‘Heirship of the Buckmann name falls to Felicia,’ he said,” I confirmed, to which her shoulders sank and all spirit left her mien.  The sight wounded me.  “Emilie.  I’m sorry.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Why do you apologise…?”</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Why’?  Emilie, you and I… we’re no longer betrothed,” I answered carefully.  “Your life&mdash;it’s gone to shambles, I fear.”</p><p class="calibre10">Stupefaction flashed across her face.  The moment saw her paralysed.</p><p class="calibre10">“Wh… what do you mean we’re no…  But… <i class="calibre3">why!?”</i></p><p class="calibre10">A question asked with a voice wishing to scream.</p><p class="calibre10">“I wish it weren’t so, but it is.  It very well is.”</p><p class="calibre10">The breaking of our bond was set in stone the moment I was abjured by my family.  An outcome as crushing as it was clearly seen from yonder, but that it was obscured from Emilie’s ken told much of how mired her thoughts had become.  The course of our conversation found her in constant shock, after all.</p><p class="calibre10">“You were to wed the coming master of House Buckmann,” I reiterated.  “But that claim is lost to me now.  And with it, the betrothal once binding us.”</p><p class="calibre10">“B-but that can’t…!  No!  Rolf, I still…!  I…”</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie…  It’s my fault.  I failed the rites.
