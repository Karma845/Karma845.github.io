<p style="text-indent: 40px">Balasthea Stronghold.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Fort and fastness of Ström—though fast no more, and only faintly a fort, for now was its soldiery boiling in bedlam, whilst its commandant’s seat stood dark and unsat.  North of the gates loomed a stretch of Nafílim country, hemmed in by forests, near the mouth of which newly scintillated with a sea of candles.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That is, torches beyond count.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Night was fallen, and those far-off firelights seemed to seethe all the more hotly.  Only some-odd hours before had a few Fiefguardsmen emerged from those very same forests, sallowed and dispirited in their flight.  Their words for the fort-men: Hensen was a failure.  Absent the appalling report, any man would have taken the torches to be the Fiefguard’s own, but oh, <i>alas.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Why, dominion over this very domain hinged on Hensen’s sacking.  Such was the mind of each and every military man here.  What fright they knew, then, upon learning of both the Fiefguard’s loss and the spears of reprisal now bared balefully at Balasthea’s battlements.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">None could have predicted such a contingency.  A madness made more mad by the unmaking of the fort’s chain of command: neither commandant nor vice-commandant were anywhere to be seen at present.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All the while, the lurking Nafílim horde seemed a more enormous enemy, and in fact, it very much was: never before had so great a hostile number rallied before the margins of Ström.  A number perhaps mustered in the wake of the fighting at the fólkheimr: felling the Fiefguard looked only to have whetted the devils’ bloodlust, and now were they come to the margravate to slake it in full.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Who, then, would challenge so tremendous a foe?  The fort-men certainly fancied themselves too fraught for the feat, commanderless as they were.  The larger half of them fumed and flailed in confusion.  The smaller all but sank in place, panicked.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But one amongst them was different.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Morten full-moiled with fury.  His fingers fidgeted, all too fain to lay the blame.  Much of it was reserved for the Vice-Commandant Ebbe, who, though left in charge of the fort, had frolicked off to Hensen with the now-fallen Fiefguard and his band of silvered soldiers.  But the one who most annoyed this nail-biting bloke was none other than Rolf himself, for surely enough, the moment found the acting commandant off on some merry holiday.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Well, any situation less mad than this was a merry one, no doubt.  Nevertheless, that gear-grating ungraced had ostensibly sped off to the forested foe-lands for some reconnaissance.  Yet his return was unreported.  Mayhap he was maimed?  Unmade upon meeting some Nafílim force?  A soothing salve upon Morten’s nerves, if so.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That guffin’ good-fer-naught…  Damn ‘im…!” was his lip-biting outburst.  Though true enough, Morten made himself a civil, simpering man whensoever aface his commandant, for truer still was the fort made a fairer place thanks to Rolf’s rigours.  So long as that fangless leader did the leading, Morten and his fort-mates were most content to couch under the commandant’s secure shade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And yet Rolf was, at the end of the day, a defect, a Deiva-spurned sprout in which no growth ought be expected, for all odyl was denied from him.  Thus Morten’s mind deigned not to harbour a hint of reverence for Rolf.  Empty praises were all the commandant would earn from him, and that was exactly what the soldier offered.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Morten well-fancied himself a savant of diplomacy as a result, thinking Rolf ill-discerning the dagger hidden behind his back.  For Rolf was an ungraced; how <i>could</i> his hollow pate previse Morten’s deep designs?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Indeed, concealed scorn and derision were all he had for his commandant.  How pale with appalment Morten was, then, when he spotted Rolf returning at last—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—riding amidst a Nafílim envoy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hmph,” scoffed Volker.  “That Balasthea should break ere a bead of blood be spilt…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Writ on his face was faint shock, an expression shared by Lise as the two walked through the corridor alongside me.  Quiet, dark, and empty was the keep interior; the fort defenders had chosen surrender without resistance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A rather wise decision on their part.  The men were leaderless, after all, and faced with a foe of affrighting numbers.  But to drive the nail in the coffin, counted amongst those enemy ranks was myself.  The months of employ in this stronghold have imprinted in me every nook and cranny of the place, as well as every dot and detail of its operation and capabilities.  Victory against so knowledgeable a foe, then, was all but a fever dream to these fort fellows.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">They had at first quaked with confusion when I confronted them, and then with veiny fury.  It lasted but a little while, however, for it soon set in for them that resistance would sooner wreak their bloody reckoning.  I then compelled their quick decision on guarantee of their safe flight to Arbel, and realising their lives were otherwise on the verge of vain sacrifice, the soldiers at once saw the appeal of capitulation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so was precipitated the fall of Balasthea, without so much as a single swing of a sword to sting the scene.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But here on hid the main hurdle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In spite of the broken chain of command, word was likely making swiftly to the fief-burgh.  Indeed, the margrave would be apprised apace were his precious fort to ever fall.  And now that it did, we must do our part and prepare to oppose his war-like answer with all alacrity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For that reason, I had set aside a moment to meet with a certain man.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Time for a talk,” I said as the three of us stopped along the corridor, afront the appointed room.  “Wait here a while.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Fair wi—ah, fair words find you, Rolf!” cheered Lise in a spirited whisper.  Expectation, or perhaps even enjoyment, jubilated in her voice as I turned the doorknob.  Entering, I found the room cast in grainy gloom, illumed only by a lonely lamp.  Next to it was one of Balasthea’s bulwark-men: Morten.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Rather long since last we met,” I greeted him, closing the door behind me.  “Nay; ‘long’ be too long, thinking on it.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Morten: the very man who ushered me out of Balasthea as I departed with Mia to her village.  Though but a scant three days and a half had passed since then, it felt to me an age ago.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“C-Commandant, sir…” he said, sat at a small table, his hands in view as they vexedly fidgeted, “&#8230;wot be th’meanin’ o’ all this?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And his voice was just as vexed, quivering confusedly.  My actions seemed to him an impenetrable puzzle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Can’t believe your eyes?” I began.  “I’ve <i>turned</i> on the kingdom, Morten.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“T… <i>turn…!”</i> he wheezed.  “Ye lost yer marbles, man…!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nay, I’m afraid not.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Amidst the mirk of the room, I leant back upon the door and folded my arms, staring intently upon the appalled man.  Glinting against the lamplight was sweat beading on both his brows.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“In Hensen, were it?  When th’Fief-men fell,” he said unsteadily, pointing a finger at me.  “Ye ‘ad a gander o’ their bodies, bloodied an’ all—that’s when yer ‘eart flip’d, when ye abandon’d th’banner, is it?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I shook my head.  “Wrong, Morten.  All wrong.  In fact, the Fiefguard hasn’t fallen.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“W… <i>wot…?”</i>  The face of a fool was then upon him… and perhaps upon me, as well, for I had little confidence in faking a look.  Much gratitude, then, to the eigengrau veiling the air between us.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The men’ve smote the fólkheimr’s defences, my friend,” continued my lie.  “The Fiefguard holds Hensen as we speak.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“B-bu… but that sorts opposite wit’ wot th’return’d Fief-men said!” Morten began disputing.  “Wot ‘bout that ‘orde wot’s loomin’ at th’wood-edge, ey?  Wot explains ‘em?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Those ‘returned” Fiefguardsmen be turncoats themselves, Morten.  The Nafílim paid them with fattened purses on promise of spewing lies to their fellow liegemen,” I explained.  “That horde you see is but half a host, lighting twice-fold torches to pretend a meaner number.  A ruse, Morten.  A <i>Nafílim</i> ruse.  And a common one, at that, well-recounted in our war chronicles.  Don’t tell me you’ve little taste for literature, my good fellow?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The soldier then flapped his lips like a fish out of water.  It seemed his wits were too whelmed by my wiley words.  And so I went on.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The Fiefguard fought with perfection.  Their numbers, their tactics all proved the tailwind to take Hensen.  But to have <i>fallen,</i> instead?  Balderdash, Morten.  This, you know as well as I.  Don’t you?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I-I does, sir.  I <i>should,”</i> Morten relented, wrinkling his brows.  “&#8230;But wot then, Commandant?  Wot’s this ‘bout turnin’ on th’kingdom, ey?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Not to worry,” I assured him, before resuming in a sharp whisper.  “I’m only knifing along with the Nafílim for a while.  They be desperate to spite the Fiefguard for their defeat at home, you see.  Thus they give me aid, and I their prize.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Prize, sir?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Indeed—this <i>very fort.”</i></p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">───────── ∵ ─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Unfolding my arms, I started forth, the wooden floor squeaking under my slow steps.  Then, reaching Morten, I sat down across from him and stared deep into his eyes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Morten.  Of all my men have you—and you <i>alone</i>—regarded me with any respect.  Me: an ungraced.  Yoná Herself ought shudder with shame, knowing you take for an equal whom She curses a coistril.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Uh er, th-that…” muttered Morten, uneasy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yours… be a heart of <i>gold,</i> Morten.  A far cry from the coals blackening the other blokes’ bosoms,” I continued with constructed pain, as though to squeeze blood out of a stone.  “You <i>know,</i> don’t you?  Of how I’ve long suffered their snideness, their <i>scorn.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I felt then my farce having gone a mite too far, a too-passionate thespian catching himself in his craze.  But from the look of him, Morten seemed quite convinced of the act.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Well… I’ve had my fill of their <i>filth,”</i> the play persisted.  “Keen am I to leave Londosius.  But not before lining my coffers full of coin.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“C-coin?” Morten cocked his head.  “Wot means ye, Commandant?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“From the Fiefguard, my friend.  I reckon they’ll soon return from Hensen, swaggering with heads held high and waggons wiggling with loot.  But those sots’ll be too sotted from victory to see the snare abiding them at Balasthea.  Should prove easy enough: parade the prey into their cage, and then… drop the doors shut.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To this, the soldier stayed silent.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Serves them right, I say,” I went on.  “Stings my stomach every time I see those flaunting fools.  You feel as I do, don’t you Morten?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Slowly did he start nodding.  “Y… y-yea, I-I feels it, yea.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Soldiers oft find guard duty dull and damnable drudgery.  Many would rather follow along on forays, to plunder riches and enlarge their names.  And so is conceived a hierarchy amongst the soldiery, of attackers being at the top and the defending rest doomed to the bottom.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Fiefguard followed this to a tittle, always sporting their supposed superiority over the fort-men.  Such flagrancy, of course, earned the latter’s grating disgust, birthing between them friction of no small heat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My thought, then, was to stoke that fire, as it were, hence my tempting Morten with a pretend ploy to pilfer the Fiefguard.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But there’s the rub, my friend,” I sighed.  “Coin alone ill-makes a flight less fraught.  I need company.  I need <i>women.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Another slow set of nods.  “&#8230;Er… y-yea, I sees why, sir.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Good.  Very good.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Morten was beginning to pick his words, that he might pander to my increasing desperation.  Where he once fidgeted frailly, he now stood at last upon the arena of negotiation.  What remained was to lure him into outwitting me—with him none the wiser.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But can you <i>help,</i> Morten?  For <i>help</i> is all I beg of you,” I said pleadingly.  “Pray seek a sound selection of Arbel’s women and whisk them to me.  Please—you’re the only man I trust enough with this trouble.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But sir, er… I reckons only a fat an’ full coffer’s got coin ‘nough, if ye be wantin’ brothel-bints fer a whole journey, yea?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I shook my head.  “No matter.  I’ll strip the Fiefguard of all their troves.  That should fill coffers enough for a great many journeys, no doubt.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“N-no doubt, indeed.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Of course, you’ll not go unrequited, Morten.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“H… haha,” he half-smiled.  “Oh, ye be too kind, Commandant.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And Morten be a man too contemptuous to play along with the ungraced he so scorned.  No, he himself was pretending, showing me his false spark of treachery.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This fidgeting fellow—over the past moment were his eyes stuck down-left.  We Men are like to look up when tending to a truer answer, and down when a lie is upon our lips.  And when guilt sits heavy on our hearts, we hook our eyes towards our indextrous hand.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thus was Morten’s a mind for the lie.  Of course, it’s all just a generality, this matter of trends of truth and untruth.  But here it held water, for unwicked was the sweat upon Morten’s meandering mien.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“So what’s your mind, Morten?  I ask not that you come with me.  Two, three gainly gamesters be all I beg you bring,” I pressed him.  “Please, Morten.  For me.  We are <i>friends,</i> are we not?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Uh, ermm,” he sighed, folding his arms.  “W-wot <i>ever</i> shall I do…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I had thought my theatrics thin of all credibility, but Morten’s was no less crude.  Two hams, hammering out deceitful diplomacy with all gravity—a masterclass in comedy, to be sure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Mm…” Morten moaned in thought.  “&#8230;Yea.  Yea, why not?  Fer me friend!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Good man, Morten!  You have my debt!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There I beamed most awkwardly, whilst the man himself simpered amidst his sweat.  Why, I could almost hear the standing ovation.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">After watching Morten gallop off to Arbel, Volker, Lise, and I retreated to a chamber within the fort keep.  There in the dim, we faced one another to discuss what course our cause should take… and what hand the fates might deal us.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Rolf,” Lise began, “the talk went well?  Or…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Well enough, I’d wager,” answered I.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Doubtless Morten would immediately divulge my defection to the margrave.  And as well: my plans to pinch and pilfer the Fiefguard as they file through the fort on their glorious return.  Only one of these strings strummed true, of course, but the margrave should be none the wiser.  Thus I foresaw his answer being but one: the immediate mobilisation of his remnant men to recapture and secure Balasthea.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ours, on the other hand, would be that of open war, to strike back the brutes directly as they come.  Such was unavoidable.  To ensure victory in the coming all-out assault on Arbel, its men must be whittled down as much as our knife-edges could suffer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Two thousand—the number of the Fiefguard’s fallen at Hensen.  A number of which veracity the margrave must mull over, but a number we ourselves knew to be true.  Given that, were we to succeed in drawing out the remnant Fiefguard from their fastness at Arbel, and there in the open cull their ranks by ambush, then we carve out for ourselves a preemptive advantage in our later attack on the fief-burgh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And there would be witnessed a reverse of the battle of Hensen, a flipping of the gameboard—this was the result we sought, the battlefield we aimed to artifice.  The Nafílim had defended their home at a disadvantage.  Now it was the margrave’s turn to quaff that cruel medicine, a brew of our own making, unbeknownst to him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“We braves once savour’d much advantage.  But the taste was taken from our tongues the day you don’d the commandant’s coat,” Volker reflected, looking at me.  “How affrighting the fair winds be, that once again should we find ourselves in a vie for advantage—on what day but the very day you damn’d your kingdom and offer’d us your sword.”  He scoffed at the irony.  “You be a wolf that moves the moon, Rolf.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Affrighting, for true,” echoed Lise.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nay, my part is small.  The mightier merit invests you, Volker.  Hensen stands now by the buttress of your bravery,” I said.  “Besides, not all the cards be laid yet: the deck is dire with <i>two</i> jokers, and both must move to our mind, lest a poor jest be made of our plans.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Jokers by the names of Morten and the Margrave Aaron Ström.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The latter likely already caught wind of the Fiefguard’s defeat at Hensen.  But at his other ear would soon be Morten, unknowingly feeding the margrave my worm of a lie: to wit, news of the Men’s <i>victory</i> at the fólkheimr.  A tiding with a sweeter tune, no doubt, but numbering only one of two, all told.  Which shall earn the lord’s heedance?  Our scheme saw heavy need of his trusting to his pride than his prudence, and so it was that our fortunes were borne upon Morten’s shoulders, whether he knew it or no.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Given the margrave’s mind and circumstance, more likely than not should he be inclined to Morten’s mouth.  But likeliness was smaller solace than certainty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Our hand finds frail challenge, I think.  The winds do seem warmer to your bending, Rolf,” Volker conjectured.  “At the very least, that dolt of a Man earlier ought amount to little more than a pawn, one whose simple play we need not guess.  For no doubt the defeat has wounded the pride of these Men, and this scheme offers them the too-sought salve of self-deception.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Self-deception, denial—powerful salves, indeed.  Morten is a simple man of simple pleasures; to him, there is comfort in contemning an addle-pated ungraced.  He thinks himself the eagle-eyed angler to have scried my naked scheme when he is sooner the fish, flailing with not fear, but euphoria for his biting the bait.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So it is, then, that the temptation to unmake my skein, to strop and stroke his pride, should prove a current too fierce for his fins to defy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Though frankly, I did feel our feint overzealously zested.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Speaking of deception,” I said, turning to the war-chief, <i>“&#8230;’women’,</i> Volker?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The ploy was put together by myself, but it was Volker who added the finishing touches.  Indeed, the inspiration to task Morten in finding for me the bawdy-women that I so “needed” came from no one else’s mind but Volker’s calculating own.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A necessity.  Details decide the day,” he asserted with not a flinch.  I suppose “meticulousness” should be added to my measure of him.  Thankfully it looked to have served us well, for it has given Morten exactly what he wanted: a sight of Rolf the reproachable gadabout.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I say, ‘twas a part played perfect!” giggled Lise with a sidelong smirk.  “A coxcomb of a character, a Man with more mind paid to women and mammon than the prizes of prudence—you <i>reeked</i> of the role, Rolf!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I groaned.  “Your compliment cuts deep…”</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thinking on it, she <i>was</i> quite livid upon our reunion, Lise.  Could this be revenge, then?  For my hailing her a “raging beast”?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A warm wound, from Lise with love!” she prodded on.  “You ought savour the sweet sting!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Edelfräulein,” Volker said after a slight sigh at the exchange, “our forces stand ready.  We move now, or?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">His tone echoed with uncharacteristic tiredness, as though worn from many a winter of humouring the jarl’s daughter.  Though it seemed her esteemed title of <i>Edelfräulein</i> had yet to unstick itself from Volker’s tongue.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Right,” nodded Lise.  “Rolf, you’ll not mind if everyone files into the fort?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Not at all.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Suffice it to say, we had indeed marched along with the Nafílim “horde”.  And “horde” be accurate enough: it comprised quite nearly the whole of Hensen’s hosts.  The torches being twice-fold lit—<i>that</i> was the lie.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The next step was to welcome this bristling number into Balasthea and begin preparing at once for the coming clash.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Best we temper ourselves for aught untoward,” I said.  “Even should the margrave and his men move to our liking, it means little if we do not break them in battle.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To this, the two nodded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The capture and occupation of Arbel—such was our grand objective, and the next battle would serve as its opening blow.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Only, at this point, a certain soul was come to the fief-burgh.  A soul I knew all too well, but one I never dared imagine would make an appearance—now, of all times.</p>
