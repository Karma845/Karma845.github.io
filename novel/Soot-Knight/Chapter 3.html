<p class="calibre10">“Reinforcements?  For the 1st, my Lady?” I asked.</p><p class="calibre10">“That’s right,” answered Emilie.  “Even now, they’re battle-locked in the waters of the Erbelde&mdash;they’ve called for aid, and we’re to answer.”</p><p class="calibre10">Two years have passed since Emilie and I enlisted in the Order, and we now stood at the precipice of our first real battle.</p><p class="calibre10">To go this long without any action was apparently not too uncommon an occurrence here at the 5th, known as it was for being rather sheepish about getting its hands dirty.  Regardless, Mareschal Tallien himself and the leadership were quite thrilled about this new development&mdash;the boredom had finally taken its toll, it seemed.  As such, it was by then a certainty that most of the 5th would be mobilised for this mission.</p><p class="calibre10">At present, the 1st Chivalric Order and the Nafílim horde were staring each other down at the Erbelde Broadrun, a prominent river snaking through the kingdom’s eastern reach.</p><p class="calibre10">To the Nafílim, it was a line they meant to jealously defend, and thus were dug in their heels trying to ward off the invading knights of the 1st&mdash;no easy task, given the latter’s distinction as the crème de la crème of the kingdom’s military menu, as it were.</p><p class="calibre10">The knightly host, for its part, was charged with breaking through the enemy line and securing the fertile river basin from which the Erbelde flowed&mdash;a foray that the 5th now wholly tasked itself to assist.</p><p class="calibre10">“And when do we leave?” I asked further.</p><p class="calibre10">“In three days hence,” Emilie confirmed.</p><p class="calibre10">“Quite the hurry.  Though if the 1st saw need of reinforcements, time would be precious, I presume.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m told the 1st’s numbers count greater than the enemy’s, actually.  Winning there shall prove most lucrative; ‘twould seem they won’t settle for aught less than a certain victory.  That’s where we come in.”</p><p class="calibre10">Where we come in, she said?  I see.  It would seem our kingdom deemed the potential boon too precious to give up.  Our role as reinforcements was to make certain this victory they so sought&mdash;meaning a spark of opportunity had at last been found at the end of much struggle.</p><p class="calibre10">“A month and more it’s been since the 1st moved to retake the Erbelde.  If they’ve been stalled by a stalemate that entire time, then they’ve called for reinforcements to try and pierce the impenetrable… or is it that the fates have revealed an opening, my Lady?”</p><p class="calibre10">“They have, from the looks of it.  And the 1st means not to squander their newfound fortune.”</p><p class="calibre10">Put another way, failing to capitalise on this opportunity would likely mean a return to the dreaded stalemate.  No wonder our kingdom was bending over backwards to settle the battle once and for all.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf, let’s give it our all!” Emilie smiled.</p><p class="calibre10">“My all, I will give,” I returned.  “Though pray tell, who draws the plans for our march?”</p><p class="calibre10">“The mareschal does, with the commissariat under his wing.  But I’m afraid all the haste has whipped them into quite the fevered flock.”</p><p class="calibre10">“The march will be no birdwalk, let alone the coming battle itself,” I observed.  “If the Erbelde is our destination, cutting through the Belithas Steppe is sure to save us time, but I fear the midsummer sun’s glare dares to sap us of our strength and spirits both.  I say we must needs march through the Sewell Wealdlands insteadーthe air is cooled by the trees there, and with waters running aplenty, our men need not worry of thirsting along the way.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Se-Sewell, you said?  Hmm…  You do have a point,” said Emilie.  “Right, I’ll be sure to take up this matter with the mareschal.”</p><p class="calibre10">From then until the day of departure, the 5th was aboil in its busied bustling.  All within were in high spirits, but each also found himself itching with unease.  Training was officially held off till departure as well, but defying this, I resumed my own regimen as usual.  The coming mission was all the more reason to continue honing myself.</p><p class="calibre10">On the benighted eve of our departure, I peered up at the eastern sky, having just finished sword practice.</p><p class="calibre10">Would I be of some use, odylless as I am?  Will I find some part to play in the looming battlefield?  These, I need only to find out for myself.</p><p class="calibre10">Somewhere beyond the eastward horizon, the knights of the 1st were mired in the heat of battle&mdash;to them, I sent these uncertain thoughts.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>

<p class="calibre10">“Rolf!  Forgive me!” were Emilie’s first words right upon the day of our departure.</p><p class="calibre10">I’ll hazard a guess: I’m to remain here as a watchdog.  Or perhaps the marching scheme remains unchanged?  The only one to be troubled would be myself, were it the former.</p><p class="calibre10">The latter, however…</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Twas no good: the mareschal’s settled on the route through Belithas.  I insisted on Sewell, but my words fell on deaf ears,” Emilie explained.</p><p class="calibre10">“I see,” was my sunken response.  “My Lady, did you perchance mention that I had aught to do with the Sewell proposal?”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie twiddled her fingers in regret.  “I… did.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Would that you hadn’t.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Th-the other leaders, they sought speed over all else!  A march through Belithas would take seven days, and Sewell nine.  ‘Detours are not for reinforcements to take,’ they said,” Emilie elaborated.  For why, I could not know; there was little point in it now.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes.  You are certainly right, my Lady,” I resigned.  “We must move with utmost dispatch.  It won’t do to keep the 1st waiting.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Right,” Emilie replied.  “We leave soon.  I trust you’ve made ready?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I have, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">Hence marched the 5th Order to the eastern fringes of the realm, where ran the Erbelde’s embattled waters.  In spite of the occasion, however, my spirits failed to match themselves to the surrounding excitement.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">Five hours had gone by since the morning of our departure.  We Owlcranes marched alongside the Mareschal Tallien on horseback, save for myself, of course: the entirety of the trip so far saw me afoot, pulling Emilie’s mount along.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…” she called to me from upon her saddle.  “How are you faring?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Well enough, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">A look around revealed the 5th’s officers quietly bearing themselves under the sweltering sun, the toil having stolen the mood for idle chatter.  Many were not given a steed of their own, such as my fellow swains and officers whose specialisations eschewed the luxury.  Regardless, they all suffered the heat just the same, as their furrowed faces and laborious breaths indicated.</p><p class="calibre10">“Heard you came up with the Sewell route, eh ungraced?” Gerd hissed.  “Thought we’d be better off sauntering under the cool canopies, now did you?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I did, Lord Gerd.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hah! <i class="calibre3">Reinforcements</i>&mdash;out on a jolly, wooded safari, taking their sweet time along the way.  What folly!” struck Gerd.</p><p class="calibre10">“Hurrying through hell, only to be paralysed with exhaustion&mdash;a fool’s errand any <i class="calibre3">reinforcements</i> should avoid, I would think,” I countered.</p><p class="calibre10">To this, Gerd audibly clucked and made ready to shout.  “What’s that, now?  Sharp be his tongue the hound who but tugs the master’s steed till <i class="calibre3">his</i> own exhaustion!  Don’t think for a second that our ranks suffer aught should you drop dead, ungraced!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Oi, mickle-berk.  Quite the softy, ain’t ye, fer a giant?” Raakel chimed in.  “Don’t ye go beefin’ on us when it gets proper maftin’, ey!”</p><p class="calibre10">“My words were misplaced.  Forgive me, Lord Gerd, Lady Raakel.”</p><p class="calibre10">We soon took and finished our midday meals.  The march resumed under the unrelenting glare of the sun, which conjured up from the ground  a veil of mirages, wriggling and seething.  Through them, the 5th’s footfalls dragged, heavily and heavier still.</p><p class="calibre10">Two, three hours crept on by.  The march’s momentum noticeably slowed all the while.  Even those mounted have all but ceased their utterings.</p><p class="calibre10">Each and every one of our throats begged for water, but they could scarcely be slaked: unlike the Sewell Wealdlands, abound with runnels and rivulets as they were, the steppes of Belithas afforded no source of water by which our stores of it could be replenished.  We could only partake according to a strict regimen, though that unfortunately had not stopped our water supply from running low.</p><p class="calibre10">Merciless was the screaming sun in searing away our stamina.  Haggard breaths scratched against the air all around.  Some soon even found their eyes meandering from all the strain.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Oi.  Ungraced,” muttered Gerd.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, my Lord?”</p><p class="calibre10">“A break.   That’s what you want.  Isn’t it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay.  I can keep the course.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hah.  You traitorous lot.  Brew your lies to taste, I see,” Gerd retorted.  “Too bad.  No break for you.  Not for a long while yet.”</p><p class="calibre10">He was right.  There would be no breaks, not where we were: Belithas lacked not only water, but also aught that could spare even a sliver of shade.  And raising tents each and every time we were to take rest was simply out of the question.</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m well aware, my Lord.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hmph.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hardly do I see your course being kept for much longer, dear swain.  Already, you have quite the shimmer of sweat about you,” Sheila remarked.  “I understand you long to pretend the paragon, but if knighthood be your aim, you had best lay down your lies.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay, Lady Sheila,” I began to rebut.  “I will keep my course.  This much sweat warrants no worry.  If there is a concern to be had, it should be of lacking salt.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Salt, you say?” Sheila wondered aloud.</p><p class="calibre10">Veritably so.  The summer months saw coal miners and their ilk regularly partake of salt. But it was vain to expect the others here to know of this, pampered princes as they all were.</p><p class="calibre10">“Was that why you insisted that we lick some salt, Rolf?  During lunchtime?” asked Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">“Indeed, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Suckle on salt as though it be a teat o’ water&mdash;yer brightest idea yet, ye twiny-twonk!” heckled Raakel.</p><p class="calibre10">Such hollow conversations continued on as we marched east.  The skies sank into twilight, but that did little to abate the heat.  Our formations had by that point dissolved into disarray.  Those mounted resigned themselves to hanging their gazes down onto the backs of their horses, silent all the while.</p><p class="calibre10">In spite of the sheer toil, the 5th somehow managed to arrive at the first day’s designated destination.  Everyone was all but spent, eager only to quit.  For their part, the leadership were gathered around the mareschal, discussing plans for the overnight camp.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Make sure all goes as planned,” ordered Tallien.  “Emilie, the nightwatch proceeds as we have arranged.  Go ahead and confirm the particulars with the other lieutenants.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Right away, Mareschal.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Permission to speak, Lady Emilie,” I interjected.</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh?” she said with a startle.  “Yes, go ahead, Rolf.”</p><p class="calibre10">Apparently, the others still had the vigour to show their unbridled disgust towards an ungraced, whose sole role in the meeting was to stand idle by Emilie as her dutiful swain.  But I couldn’t let their livid looks stop me.  The situation was dire; it was now or never.</p><p class="calibre10">“Requesting a change in plans,” I began proposing.  “We should finish supper without erecting the tents, and resume marching through the night after a short break.  This, I believe, best serves our interests.”</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Cover ground whilst the sun is sunk,’ is what you are saying, now?” Tallien summarised.</p><p class="calibre10">“That is correct, Mareschal.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And you’d best mind your tongue, ungraced,” Gerd cut in, his voice low and lethal like a knife upon the neck.  “We’ve not trained in night-marching, and you would have us leap into a trial by fire?  Spent as we are?”</p><p class="calibre10">“It is hardly an affront to common sense as you may believe, Lord Gerd.  Marching by cover of night in the midst of summer is a measure frequently undertaken, as our military annals would gladly attest,” I rebutted.  “Furthermore, the lay of Belithas is both level and open, and lies firmly within friendly territory.  I believe we scarce imperil ourselves were we to proceed as I’ve outlined.”</p><p class="calibre10">“There’s little comfort to be had in a ‘scarce peril’, ungraced!” Gerd yelled.</p><p class="calibre10">“We have been quite conservative in our consumption of water, Lord Gerd, and yet our stores of it already find themselves depleted two-tenths beyond projections.  At this rate, many of our men will be forced to withdraw before ever reaching the 1st&mdash;all on account of severe dehydration.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Dam that tongue of yours, you bloody wastrel!  Don’t you dare speak as though you know aught!”</p><p class="calibre10">Well, this is going rather swimmingly.</p><p class="calibre10">Gerd had all but surrendered himself to his emotions, and they were to him as a horsewhip set upon the horse, lashing to be beat of my every word.  Talk of the Sewell route earlier that day must have been crossing his mind, in spite of his thorough mocking of it.  That we hadn’t chosen the wooded route precipitated the sorry state the soldiers of the 5th now found themselves in, and in light of this reality, Gerd was moulding his shame into fresh anger with my name writ large upon it.</p><p class="calibre10">But as it stood, the march itself was in dire straits in every sense.</p><p class="calibre10">“Mareschal Tallien.  I support Rolf’s idea,” came Emilie, cutting in.  “Had we marched according to his design, we would not find ourselves in such circumstances as we are now.  I believe we should change our marching scheme while we are yet able, just as he had described.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ach!” Gerd groaned bitterly.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie’s words were as oil doused upon a flame.  Glad was I for her support, but with the mention of routes worming into his ears, Gerd was at that point right about to explode.  Emilie speaking to the mareschal instead did not help in calming the Owlcrane’s fuming temper, either.</p><p class="calibre10">It was then that reinforcements of a different sort arrived.</p><p class="calibre10">“An’ ye best quench that flamin’ tongue o’ yours, Gerd.  I see yer worry’d ‘bout this ‘scarce peril’, but what with the likes o’ us, it be child’s play, no?  Besides, runnin’ dry o’ water’s a mite tough, if I’m honest.  Why not treat us selves to a nice mooch under the stars?  Save some water along the way, ey?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Mr. Gerd,  I must confess: I, too, am agreed with the Misses Emilie and Raakel.”</p><p class="calibre10">Rational thought still had a home in Raakel and Sheila, it looked like.  Gerd very much seemed the brat being coddled by more calm and collected souls.  That he did not take offence spoke of the long years the two women had suffered his company; indeed, by now, they’ve become quite deft in dealing with that firebrand of a man.</p><p class="calibre10">‘I, too, am agreed with the Misses Emilie and Raakel.’  Likely a phrase not carefully contrived, but one that slipped quite naturally from the lips.  Well said, Sheila.  Leaving me out of the picture and agreeing instead with the other girls was rather tactful.</p><p class="calibre10">“Gerd, you’re one of our prized aces, aren’t you?  ‘Twould be a great ease to us all to have you in tip-top shape for the coming battle, wouldn’t you say?” Emilie followed up with a smile, one that seemed to seal the deal to no small effect.</p><p class="calibre10">“…I would,” Gerd relented with a coarse sigh.  “Fine, then.”</p><p class="calibre10">The other brigades found no reason to doubt the Owlcranes’ will, seeing as the latter were their superiors in rank.  Things were beginning to look up, at last.</p><p class="calibre10">“All who oppose?” Tallien inquired, looking all along the other lieutenants.  Their collective silence signalled consent.  “None.  Right, we resume marching tonight.  Leaders, finish supping and tell your men to rest.  Meet back with me once that is done.  Adjourned!”</p><p class="calibre10">Disgust and contempt twisted the faces of the leadership as they dispersed&mdash;Tallien included.  Compromise was a bitter medicine indeed, but one they were compelled to swallow.</p><p class="calibre10">It was settled: we would march by night.  Our troubles were sure to continue, but nonetheless, Emilie couldn’t help but smile amongst the sea of frowns.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">Resting at day under the canopy of canvases, treading at night under the canopy of constellations&mdash;we, the 5th, slowly but surely made our way to the banks of the Erbelde Broadrun.</p><p class="calibre10">Our progress was ever in the company of sweltering temperatures and nagging fatigue, but it was undoubtedly preferable to the hell that was the first day’s march.  In accordance with the leadership’s revisions to the logistics guidelines, we’ve offloaded extraneous supplies and equipment along the way.  With our burdens cut down to the barest minimum, we were able to maintain a slightly more expedient march.</p><p class="calibre10">Our collective fatigue mounted as the days wore on, but on the seventh, at long last our perseverance carried us beyond the fringes of the Belithas Steppe.</p><p class="calibre10">We rested under the shade of our tents, waiting for the sun to set.  The hour of departure was soon upon us.  By my estimation, we would reach the Erbelde in the dead of night.</p><p class="calibre10">It was by no small miracle that we’ve gotten as far as we did.  Even then, such a miracle afforded little succour for the worn and weary officers.  Despite the progress made, their faces were masked in grim shadows, for each and every one of them were fully aware of the boiling battlefield that loomed at march’s end.</p><p class="calibre10">“Commence the march.  We arrive tonight.  Stay sharp, little lions!” ordered the mareschal.  His words were of paltry power and pluck&mdash;the gravity of the situation was not lost to him either, it seemed.  Nevertheless, we picked ourselves up and hoofed the last stretch of the journey to the Erbelde Broadrun, where awaited both our friends of the 1st and our Nafílim foes.</p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">Through the thick veil of night, I continued to pull Emilie’s horse along, my lips long parted from any mood for unprompted words.  For their part, the Owlcranes yet retained the strength for the battle to come, from the looks of it&mdash;able-armed professionals, just as one would expect.</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie, love,” Raakel called out from the darkness.  “There be a meetin’ with the 1st straight away when we arrive?  We Owlcranes have to plant us bums fer it too, ye reckon?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Not just us Owlcranes; everyone’s showing up,” Emilie confirmed.  “Be on your best behaviour, all right Raakel?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Bloomin’ ‘eck…” winced Raakel.  “Aye aye, m’lady Lieutenant.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Miss Emilie, what do you suppose of the operation’s design?”</p><p class="calibre10">Sheila’s question earned a troubled face from Emilie.  “I’ve… not been told of it much myself, to be honest.  Though I’m sure the 1st would have us hear of it to our heart’s content.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You don’t mean to say the 1st will snag the reins over us Owlcranes, do you Emilie?” came another inquiry, this time from Gerd.</p><p class="calibre10">“Not at all.  Our other brigades will fall under the 1st’s command, of course, but the reins of the Owlcranes remain in my hands.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Fine with me, then.”  It would seem Gerd’s palate held no savoury impression of the 1st, shelved highly as they were in the hierarchy of Orders.  The kingdom’s sharpest sword, the mightiest Order of them all&mdash;I, for one, cannot see their power with my own eyes soon enough.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf,” Emilie called, turning ahead to me.  “What sort of battle awaits us, do you think?”</p><p class="calibre10">“One that has us fording the river, my Lady,” was my answer.</p><p class="calibre10">“What’s that now, mud-wit?  Fordin’ the river, ye say?  The Des Ailes <i class="calibre3">Greatbridge</i> is where we’re headed; why swim as fish when we’ve a proper foothold to cross upon?” Raakel quipped.</p><p class="calibre10">“Our fins will sooner avail us than our feet, Lady Raakel,” I responded.  “Neither side holds claim to the bridge, hence why the past month has seen nary a budge in the Erbelde line.”</p><p class="calibre10">Control the bridge and one controls the banks both.  That such hasn’t happened thus far attested to the stone-solid stalemate petrifying that battlefield.  And for as long as it remained unbroken, one crosses the bridge at great peril.  More likely than not, the two sides were dug in their heels on opposing sides of the bridge, staring each other down.</p><p class="calibre10">“My silly swain, is that not our purpose, then?  To temper the spear that pierces that line?” Sheila probed.</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay, my Lady.  The Des Ailes Greatbridge lives up to its namesake, true, but it can only harbour so many soldiers upon its berth, wide though it may be.  To chance forcing our way through, 1st and 5th combined, would prove a fool’s wager.”</p><p class="calibre10">“The Erbelde’s namesake be not too shabby either, muscle-pate.  Even a fool has the wits not to wager a wade through the <i class="calibre3">Broadrun</i> o’ all rivers!” Raakel retorted.  And she had a point&mdash;one that no longer stood ground, that is.</p><p class="calibre10">“And yet the 1st saw need of reinforcements&mdash;a shift in their fortunes, they’ve glimpsed.” I reminded her.</p><p class="calibre10">“That much is true.  What could it mean?” Emilie wondered.</p><p class="calibre10">“A drought, no less.  It takes a long-spanning bridge like the Des Ailes to connect the Erbelde’s banks, but the river itself is rather shallow&mdash;all the more so with the current dry spell.  Such thinned waters should expose ample purchase, enough for a large host to ford upon.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hold there, ungraced,” Gerd broke in.  “A hound should know to wag his tail and not his tongue.  How does a cur like you know of all this?”</p><p class="calibre10">“At the time of the bridge’s construction, surveys of the area were carried out by the royal geographers.  Their findings were well-documented&mdash;you can have a look yourself in the headquarters’ library.”</p><p class="calibre10">Findings from forty years ago, albeit.  But that the bridge stood to this day was proof enough of their trustworthiness.  To that, the Owlcranes could find no fault.</p><p class="calibre10">“And I’m to believe you stuck your nose that deep into the books?  All within the last few days?” prodded Gerd.</p><p class="calibre10">“The ink on my nose would attest to that belief of yours, yes, Lord Gerd,” I confirmed.  “I had merely wished to come prepared for battle.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…A battle you’re useless for,” Gerd cut under his breath.  “Well done, indeed.”</p><p class="calibre10">A look up found the moon in a march of its own, crossing past its zenith. <i class="calibre3">Soon,</i> I thought to myself, and just as I did, there rose spirited cheers from the vanguard&mdash;we’ve arrived at last, from the sound of it.</p><p class="calibre10">As we marched further, little lights twinkling in the distance revealed themselves from the darkened landscape.  The 1st’s garrison, it looked like, and from its direction came rhythmic hoof-falls&mdash;those of three mounted knights, I gathered.  They eventually appeared from the murk of night, aglimmer with argent armour.  The standards borne by our ensigns, indicating our mareschal’s presence, must have done their duty in beckoning the flying knights from their roosts.</p><p class="calibre10">“Forgive me for hailing from horseback.  I am Erik Lindell, Lieutenant of the 1st Order’s Owlcrane Brigade.  The march must have been long, yet you have all answered our call nonetheless; glad we are, and most grateful,” saluted the knight at the head of the greeting party.  He seemed almost thirty in his years, and was stately in his appearance with rich brown hair and a virile visage.  “I would lead you to the Mareschal Tiselius, but I must needs seek audience with the Mareschal Tallien first.  Is he present?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Well met, Sir Lindell.  I am Lieutenant Emilie Mernesse, also of the 5th Order’s Owlcranes,” she introduced herself.  “I see no need for such an audience.  May we proceed towards the garrison as we are?”</p><p class="calibre10">“This audience, I shall entertain,” the mareschal called out.  “Worry not, Emilie.  Erik and I are well-acquainted.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Pardon my conduct, Mareschal.  Sir Lindell, as well.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay.  ‘Tis no matter.”</p><p class="calibre10">Our mareschal then emerged from the gathered ranks.  “Erik Lindell.  How many moons has it been?  You seem sprightly as ever.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And I have Her grace to thank for it,” cordially returned this ‘Erik Lindell’.  “Yet I must apologise, Mareschal Tallien, seeing as you have all just arrived, but we would have you attend the war council right away.”</p><p class="calibre10">“As you would.  Lead the way, then.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Aye, sir!”</p><p class="calibre10">With Lindell’s guidance, we were led into the 1st’s garrison.  At last, we’ve arrived at the appointed battlefield.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">Preparations for the war council were underway, but with even the largest pavilion scarcely able to accommodate the combined leaderships of both Orders, the venue was summarily moved outside.  Chairs and tables were set up by the swains of the 1st and&mdash;by Tallien’s orders&mdash;myself.</p><p class="calibre10">The other Order was loath to include me in the elbow work, seeing how spent the 5th was from so taxing a journey, but I insisted it was of no account&mdash;our seven-day march pales in comparison to the sheer drudgery of their month-long standoff, after all.</p><p class="calibre10">With the venue set up, the two leaderships were summoned in.  Our side consisted of the mareschal, under-mareschal, the Owlcranes, the brigadiers all, and their lieutenants.  For their part, the 1st’s side consisted of the same, save for their lieutenants currently engaged in combat.  Their mareschal also appeared to be absent.</p><p class="calibre10">“My apologies, sir.  The madame will not be long,” Lindell informed Tallien.</p><p class="calibre10">“Duly noted.”</p><p class="calibre10">Moments after the exchange, there emerged a woman in her mid-twenties.  All those present promptly rose to their feet to hail her arrival.</p><p class="calibre10">“Pray forgive my late return!” rang her voice.  “I am Tiselius, mareschal to these men.  I must thank you for suffering the long march here.”</p><p class="calibre10">A blazing presence she was, crowned with flowing fuchsia-blonde curls, gentle in their undulation.  Her figure&mdash;one passus and twelve digitī in height, thereabouts&mdash;scintillated with slates of silver, and was cloaked in a crimson cascade.  A heated sigh was teased out from a soul amongst the 5th, whether by her sublime beauty or the reputation that preceded her.</p><p class="calibre10">Estelle Tiselius, Dame Mareschal of the 1st Chivalric Order.  A hero known by every Londosian through every corner of Londosius’ reach, she was esteemed as the mightiest amongst all those knighted in this realm.</p><p class="calibre10">“Mareschal Tiselius, a great pleasure after so long a while,” greeted our own commander.</p><p class="calibre10">“A while indeed!  The pleasure is mine, Mareschal Tallien,” Tiselius returned.  “The 5th’s arrival puts us at no small ease.  My deepest gratitude is yours.”</p><p class="calibre10">At her urging were those present seated, save for us swains&mdash;three from the 1st and myself, the only one from the 5th&mdash;who remained on our feet a ways back.  I looked all through the ranks of the 5th, settling upon the seat reserved for the head of the 1st Sorcery Brigade&mdash;filling it was none other than Felicia.</p><p class="calibre10">Supported by her impressive stores of odyl and a future filled with promise, Felicia had well-answered the expectations of her peers and superiors both.  Such blossoming talent earned her the station of lieutenant in just a year from her enlistment.  And with it, of course, came the title of dame.</p><p class="calibre10">The sorcerers make no use of horses on the usual, but for an executive officer like herself, Felicia was furnished with a mount for the march.  Perhaps it was in thanks to this that she was not overly exhausted by the seven-day trek, from what I could make of her condition.</p><p class="calibre10">Our eyes met for an instant before she turned hers away.  It was then that Tiselius’ voice rang forth, steady and sincere in its timbre.</p><p class="calibre10">“Let us begin the war council now, shall we?”</p><p class="calibre10">Our first battle, upon our first battlefield, for Emilie, Felicia, and myself.  Our breaths were bated as the proverbial curtains drew open.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">Mareschal Tiselius, hero-dame of our kingdom, looked all through the forgathered leaderships of both the 1st and 5th Orders.  Her lips then parted once more to address them.</p><p class="calibre10">“Our sovereign has deemed control of the Erbelde river basin to be a national interest of utmost imperative,” she began.  “The Des Ailes Greatbridge attests to our capture of this region forty-five winters ago, but our dominion lasted not twenty-five before it fell back into Nafílim hands.  The situation remains unchanged to this very moment, yet Londosius ill-abides the shame any longer.  The basin must needs be retaken.  Failure is not an option.”</p><p class="calibre10">The leadership lent their ears with grave sincerity.  Emilie and Felicia, for their part, were tense of visage, sitting with their backs both straight and taut as they paid their fullest attention.</p><p class="calibre10">“The Greatbridge measures seventeen passūs wide and spans eighty-one long,” the 1st’s mareschal continued.  “Generous, true, but deeply wanting if we intend to field the numbers needed to force our way through.  My men assay to push into the enemy’s shores as we speak, but I fear our efforts have long overspent their momentum.”  She then paused for but a moment, giving a glance to our side.  “Thankfully, the 5th has come to our aid; with them, we plan to breach the shores yonder by fording the river itself.”</p><p class="calibre10">Given both spotlight and revelation, the 5th was roused to a whirlwind of whispers and worries.  It wasn’t long before one of our brigadiers raised both hand and inquiry.</p><p class="calibre10">“Fording the river… madame?  How might we achieve this feat?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Of that, Under-Mareschal Behrmann will explain,” answered Tiselius, before turning to the side.  “Francis, you have the floor.”</p><p class="calibre10">On cue, there rose the so-named gentleman, white-maned and seeming of five decades in age.  With a firm and purposed timbre, he addressed us all.  “The 1st Order proposes to ford the drifts of Erbelde by foot, and thereby directly penetrate the enemy banks.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Afoot?  Sir, the Erbelde is tremendous; is such a manoeuvre even possible?” the brigadier pressed further.</p><p class="calibre10">“Quite it is, good soldier.  A lingering drought has sapped this region’s waters by no small degree.  We estimate the Erbelde to now measure no more than ten to fourteen palmī at her deepest.  She flows gently meanwhile; you need not worry of being whisked away by her wiles.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And pray tell, from where exactly might we ford from, Sir Behrmann?” another question, this time from Sheila.</p><p class="calibre10">“Direct your eyes to this map, if you may.  The fording points are four in number.  Teams at each will embark in tandem.  From here… and here.  On the other side, two more, as marked.”</p><p class="calibre10">The under-mareschal was earnest in his explanation, but as his finger pointed to each of the red-marked fording points, his words were met with only further commotion from the 5th.  Gerd’s voice sailed above the noise, his face now sallowed with doubt.</p><p class="calibre10">“S-sir!  Those points, they stray not seventy passūs from the bridge itself!  The enemy will have clear eyes on the forders&mdash;the drifts will be a killing field!  You don’t suppose we make easy pickings out of our own men for the Nafílim artillery?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Your worries are warranted, but I’m afraid our choices face a drought of their own,” answered Behrmann.  “Acceptable fording points number few and precious. To begin with, the entirety of the basin ever bristles with Nafílim patrols, each overeager to capture our men, should they stray too far and thin from the main battlefield.  Our best option, then, is for our bridge-stationed forces to provide the forders with cover as they brave the waters.”</p><p class="calibre10">“But sir… that’s…”  At a loss for words,  Gerd shifted his gaze elsewhere.  “Emilie, what think you?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Me?  Well, let’s see, then…” Emilie blinked.  “We reinforcements now give the 1st an even greater advantage in numbers.  The better course of action, then, is to make full use of our resources and commit to a focused attack, rather than scattering our forces far afield from the bridge.”</p><p class="calibre10">Exactly that, just as the both of us discussed prior.</p><p class="calibre10">“To be more precise, we execute an unrelenting offence via the bridge, forcing the enemy to answer in kind,” Emilie went on.  “Meanwhile, our fording teams make their way to the opposite bank, where they will all simultaneously tear holes in the enemy defensive line.  They will then press their offence till the enemy response can no longer keep up… is what I’ve gathered of the whole plan.”</p><p class="calibre10">To me did Emilie turn, and I returned the gesture with a subtle, silent nod.</p><p class="calibre10">“And you gather it well!” praised Behrmann.  “I’ve gleaned nary an error in your explanation, good miss.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Under-Mareschal,” spoke our commander.  “With our resources being precious as they are, am I correct to assume that the boats will be tasked to more pressing purposes, and our men left to cross the river unassisted?”</p><p class="calibre10">“You would be correct, yes, Mareschal Tallien.  Though the skiffs may be employed to transport the wounded of the forders back to our banks.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hmm…” Tallien ruminated.  “And what of command?”</p><p class="calibre10">“At this point, we invite only trouble by tinkering with the chain of command, I’m afraid.  The 1st, thusly, will continue to oversee operations upon the bridge, as well as comprise one of the fording columns.  Charges for the other three, we shall leave in the 5th’s hands.”</p><p class="calibre10">Our leadership responded with looks and turns at each other.  In the seeming anxiety, Felicia raised her hand.</p><p class="calibre10">“May I ask, sir, what are your designs for the defence of the forders?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Water-borne as they are, the forders will, before their departure, be bestowed with succouring magicks as a bulwark against lightning attacks.  Furthermore, a sorcerer will be placed at every three passūs along each line, his charge it is to sustain the paling over others less protected.  In addition, the vanguards will be outfitted with greatshields to bear the brunt of the enemy’s aggression.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Thank you, Under-Mareschal,” Felicia responded, before turning to Tallien.  “Sir, I request that minor adjustments be made to the 5th’s fording columns.  How wide a paling can be unfurled is a factor that varies between each of our individual sorcerers.  It is my intent to account for such margins of safety and optimise our compositions accordingly.”</p><p class="calibre10">A most reasonable proposal from Felicia.  In response, Tallien turned to the hero-dame.</p><p class="calibre10">“Mareschal Tiselius.  You shall not mind this, I take it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I shall not, of course.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Lieutenant Buckmann,” Tallien called, looking back to my sister.  “We leave this matter in your hands.”</p><p class="calibre10">“As you will, Mareschals both,” Felicia bowed.</p><p class="calibre10">Further questions and elaborations followed, at the end of which the operation’s details were reviewed.  To such, our mareschal confirmed there to be no remaining objections, and seeing this, his counterpart from the 1st gave one last glance through the gathered personnel.</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Tis settled.  We execute as planned on the morrow’s noontide.  Officers of the 5th, I bid you all take ample rest in the meantime,” announced Tiselius.  “The war council is adjourned.  Dismissed!”</p><p class="calibre10">With that, the seated leadership rose and went about their ways back to their respective tents, including those from the 5th, whose canopies were by then erected in full.  In the middle of that clamorous dispersal, Tiselius approached our commander.</p><p class="calibre10">“Mareschal Tallien,” she called.  “I must thank you once again for your aid.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You are most welcome, madame.  Rest assured, we shall spare naught to see this battle through to its rightful end.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Your men seem more in need of rest than I, lord Mareschal.  To arrive so soon from the winding woodpaths of Sewell&mdash;I can scarcely imagine what an arduous march it must have been,” she observed.  “Pray take a well-earned respite for the night.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ah… yes, the march,” Tallien hesitated.  “It was not woodpaths we crossed, but flats&mdash;those of Belithas, that is.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Belithas, you say?” came Tiselius’ surprise.  “A feat, to be sure.  And not a single soul lost, no less!”</p><p class="calibre10">“B-but of course.  I have the fates to thank; they saw fit to have us fare unscathed.”</p><p class="calibre10">“They did, indeed!”  The 1st’s mareschal’s voice was tinged deep with amazement, from the sound of it.  And while watching their exchange, I was soon to be engaged in one myself as Emilie came up from behind.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf.  Are you busy still?” she asked.</p><p class="calibre10">“Not at present, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You must be sore all over, having been afoot these past seven days.  Why not rest for the night?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay, it would appear I cannot just yet.”</p><p class="calibre10">She gave me a look.  “Wh&mdash;”</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie!” our commander interrupted.  “Have your swain tidy up this place, will you?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh y-yes, right away, Mareschal!”  Emilie’s eyes gleamed with guilt as she turned back to me.</p><p class="calibre10">Time to get back to work, it looked like.  Besides, it certainly wouldn’t do to leave all the menial drudgery to the 1st.</p><p class="calibre10">“My Lady.  It seems a bit of housekeeping is in order,” I said.  “I shouldn’t keep the 1st’s swains waiting.”</p><p class="calibre10">“All right…  Sorry, Rolf.”</p><p class="calibre10">‘By your leave’ had scarcely left my throat before another interruption beset us.</p><p class="calibre10">“The Lady Emilie Mernesse.  May I have the pleasure?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Why, Lieutenant Lindell,” answered Emilie, turning about.  “Yes, of course.  The pleasure is mine as well.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Pray be at ease.  And do call me Erik, if it pleases you.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Sir Erik it is, then.  Likewise, just Emilie will do.”</p><p class="calibre10">“But of course, Miss Emilie,” Lindell smiled.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie had garnered no short supply of attention from the members of the 1st ever since we entered their garrison.  This Lindell fellow seemed to be the boldest amongst them, meeting her face-to-face as he did.</p><p class="calibre10">“Much ado have I heard about the ‘Aureola’ of the 5th, but now I see the vaunted title speaks more of her brilliant beauty before aught else,” Lindell sang.  “What’s more, ‘twas a sparkling display of acumen you have shown us here at the war council.  Yes, most illustrious indeed!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ah… ahaha…” Emilie smiled back tensely.</p><p class="calibre10">The young woman he so lauded was very much taken by a pending engagement, but Lindell seemed not the type to be unwise to this.  I would even go so far as to say, he was not the man to be constrained by such “inconveniences”.</p><p class="calibre10">Pondering such, I took my leave of the two and got to clearing up the meeting space, working hand-in-hand with the 1st’s swains to put away the tables and chairs.  We siblings of menial toil soon indulged in a bit of chatter, where I learned they had all not been swains for more than half a year.  ‘Really now?’ was their response as I told them of my two-and-a-half year tenure.  No further words were exchanged between us thereafter.</p><p class="calibre10">I found Felicia looking on from a ways back as I silently continued to clear away the furnishings.</p><p class="calibre10">Till now, she had witnessed my bruised and battered state after training, witnessed me veritably steeping myself in soot as I swept the hearth, witnessed me attain to no more than servitude under Emilie… and at this moment, witnessed me busied with dull chores as a pivotal battle loomed on the morrow&mdash;her dear brother’s shameful lot had stolen the hopeful shine from her eyes, a loss hardly lost to me.</p><p class="calibre10">I suppose disappointing her was preferable to disheartening her, at least.</p><p class="calibre10">Such pathetic thoughts chafed about in my mind as I finished up my charges.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">Well worn-on was the night, but I would not retire to the tents just yet.  Through the 1st’s garrison I walked, and a short while of the stroll took me to the foot of a hill, to the top of which I climbed.  There splayed before me in the moonlit landscape was the object of my egging interest: the Des Ailes Greatbridge.</p><p class="calibre10">It arched over the barely babbling Erbelde, not terribly far and below from the high slope whence I stood.  Seventeen passūs wide.  Eighty-one passūs long.  A latticed mass of timberwork, ponderous in its girth.  Arrays of campfires dotted both ends, illuminating the long-sworn foes as they gnashed their teeth at one another.</p><p class="calibre10">I continued observing the war-torn scene for a few more whiles.</p><p class="calibre10">The Nafílim&mdash;this would be the first time in all the years of my life that I’ve laid eyes upon them.  And just as I had heard, they were inseparable in appearance from us humans, their sole distinction being their tawned complexion.</p><p class="calibre10">Our warring methods differed little as well: with weapons and magicks they fought, all under the guidance of codified chains of command.</p><p class="calibre10">Adept were their movements.  Intriguingly so.  Unfortunately for them, the men of the 1st were steps ahead.  Their knightly deftness was a thing of awe, sure to raise many a brow.</p><p class="calibre10">This battle saw our kingdom’s forces as the aggressor, seeking to secure the opposite banks that the Nafílim defended with no small jealousy.  Reason dictates that the latter should simply demolish the bridge, and for their part, the Nafiílim seemed to agree, if their movements were anything to go by.  But in the face of the 1st’s masterful tactics, that goal remained beyond reach.</p><p class="calibre10">The Nafílim were not fain to blow up the bridge, not as long as their own ranks were stationed upon it.  Ever were the 1st wise to this, fighting in such a way as to leave their foes with little choice but to permanently maintain a presence upon that great wooden span.</p><p class="calibre10">At any point when the Nafílim pulled back, the 1st would push forth, preserving both distance and formations all the while.  And when the Nafílim pressed forth, the 1st would fall back, shields and palings rigidly raised.  A veritable tug-of-war, one that the 1st partook with unbroken concentration.  Only by alternating their active brigades and optimising the employment of their surgiens were the 1st’s hosts able to sustain themselves through so long a struggle.</p><p class="calibre10">On occasion, the 1st would unleash a fierce offence, full-keen on shattering through the embattled line.  Well-timed, these tactics were, let loose whenever the Nafílim had already fallen far back, and the sheer aggression acted effectively in keeping our foe constantly on their toes.</p><p class="calibre10">In beholding such cunning warcraft, it was readily apparent that the 1st held within their numbers commanders of superb prowess, even amongst their intermediate ranks.  Here were the Nafílim likely reminded of a grave truth of war: retreating from such a formidable force would surely come at a dear and deadly cost.</p><p class="calibre10">“Ey up, mickle-berk!” came a call as I observed the battlefield.  From further down the slope climbed Raakel, with Gerd and Sheila in tow.  “What ye faffin’ up here ‘bout, ey?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I thought to have a look at the bridge, no less,” I answered.</p><p class="calibre10">“To see with your eyes the state of affairs, I take it?” guessed Sheila.  “My sweet swain, ever the eager schoolboy, you are.  I doubt you will glean aught, but the effort certainly earns mine admiration.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Such words, I am not worthy,” I humoured her.  “Are you all here to observe as well?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Why else?  Unlike you, we have need of knowing the goings-on of the battlefield&mdash;at all times, of course,” Gerd quipped.</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh?  Surprised am I to find company up here,” spoke a shadow.  “Hasn’t the march taxed you all enough?  I think it best to retire for the night, honoured knights of the 5th.”  Up the slope emerged Erik Lindell, Lieutenant of the 1st’s Owlcranes.</p><p class="calibre10">“And rest we shall.  We are merely come to glean a glimpse of what awaits us on the morrow,” Sheila replied.  “I, too, bid you a sweet slumber tonight, Lord Lindell.”</p><p class="calibre10">“As sweet a slumber a battlefield will bestow.  But before I retire myself, I should like to have a word with this young fellow, if I may,” Lindell returned, shifting his gaze to me.  “The fair lady Emilie spoke highly of you, my young yeoman.  Particularly of how instrumental you were in the success of the Belithas march.  A laudable deed for a mere swain, I will admit.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You humble me, good sir.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I take it you are well-versed in matters of military strategy?  Where might have you honed that keen ken of yours, my good man?”</p><p class="calibre10">“My teacher is but myself.  Books have long been a fancy to me.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ah, and so they have.  A marvellous man indeed!”  Lindell’s face was aloft with the glow of surprise.  “Yet to be made to fight in so far-flung a fringeland…  The fates never spare an inkling of ease for fresh swains nowadays, do they?”</p><p class="calibre10">“By your measure, I would be quite the pickled swain, sir, for I now serve in my third year,” I corrected.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Third year, you say?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I am but an inept and unblessed swain, shamefully so to this very day.”</p><p class="calibre10">If there ever was an unmistakable example of befuddlement, it would be Lindell’s face at this very moment.</p><p class="calibre10">“His is but a soul to which no measure of odyl has been granted, Lord Lindell,” Sheila began explaining upon seeing the lieutenant so puzzled.  “Yoná, Deiva Suprēma, has spurned him of Her holy grace.  What was given to him was only Her silence.”</p><p class="calibre10">“S… so the rumours rang true… that such a man loitered within the ranks of the 5th…  I see.  ‘Twas you.”</p><p class="calibre10">The quizzical astonishment that once misarranged Lindell’s features crumbled into quaking animosity, twisting his face into one of reddened wrath.</p><p class="calibre10">“Unholy <i class="calibre3">hound.</i> What foul business have you with the Order?  Hm?  What make you of us knights, that you would consort with us so for your own merriment and mockery?” seethed Lindell, his voice grating with unfettered anger.  Drawing up dreadfully close, the lieutenant threw forth his hands and seized me by the collars.  “Speak!  Why oh <i class="calibre3">why</i> must I share a battlefield with this… this <i class="calibre3">half-souled heathen!?</i> Come to play now, have you!?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay, it is neither my intent to idle nor play, sir,” I tried to answer calmly.</p><p class="calibre10">“A godless dreg such as you shall not be suffered here!  For this battle reckons both the holy and the profane!”</p><p class="calibre10">“And I reckon that it does not, sir.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Y… <i class="calibre3">you!”</i> fumed Lindell, before forcing me to the ground.  Impressive was his strength, befitting a knight of his high stature.  With it, he dropped down upon my torso and wrung up my collars once more, before jerking my face up to his, that he may scream into it with full fury.  “Misbegotten wastrel!  Feign to stand by her side, do you!?  Do you, now!?”</p><p class="calibre10">Ah.</p><p class="calibre10">I see the way of it.</p><p class="calibre10">Behind the storming curtains of rage and contempt for the ungraced was a smitten heart beating out the fair name of Emilie Mernesse.</p><p class="calibre10">I figured as much, given his honeyed manner whilst conversing with her earlier, when the war council had ended.  The dame of the “Aureola”, veritable jewel of the 5th, beautiful and breathtaking in her brilliance&mdash;and a lieutenant of the Owlcranes to boot, just like him.  Simple to see, then, how this man might have been so utterly taken with her.</p><p class="calibre10">And what name would sooner sing from her lips than that of “Rolf Buckmann”&mdash;my own, and as he just discovered, the name of the notorious ungraced.  Erik Lindell was not one to suffer such a farce.</p><p class="calibre10">“I am but a swain, and to the Lady Emilie, nothing more,” I attempted to explain.</p><p class="calibre10">“Of damned course you are!  Don’t you dare wet my ears with that obvious drivel!!”</p><p class="calibre10">It would seem I had driven him past the burning brink.  Still sat upon me, Lindell proceeded to hammer at my face with his two fists, their vehemence clearly bent on taking my life.  I shielded myself with both my arms, but to inadequate avail: blood was shed, darkly drenching Lindell’s coiled hands.</p><p class="calibre10">“Heretic!  Cur-bastard, you!” he screamed.  For all things a person of passion he was, whether in courting a mistress or killing a man.  Crossing his path was a fell misfortune, one that earned my untarnished displeasure.</p><p class="calibre10">“S-sir!  Stay your hand!  You mean to murder him!?” came Gerd, rushing in to part us two.</p><p class="calibre10">“I do!  Why, we ought to <i class="calibre3">gain</i> from his immediate death!  Here! <i class="calibre3">Now!</i> This rubbish has been spared the pyre overlong!”</p><p class="calibre10">“You speak madness!  He’s one of us!  Shog off, will you!?”  With heaving effort, Gerd tore the lieutenant away.</p><p class="calibre10">“That bastard… belongs not by her side… belongs <i class="calibre3">nowhere</i> at all…!!”  Lindell coarsely hissed, his eyes crazed with rage as he trained them upon me.  But even if I were to heed his wailings, I could not just up and vanish before his eyes, all to simply soothe his nerves.</p><p class="calibre10">I got back on my feet, in the while wiping away the blood coursing from my cut lips.  In time, the dust settled, and the ire in Lindell’s eyes cooled to a smoulder.</p><p class="calibre10">Collected once again, he looked to us all.</p><p class="calibre10">“…You will forgive me for the ruckus,” he said.  “Owlcranes.  My leave, I take.”  Words reserved only for the other three.  Turning on his heels, Lindell left the hill.  We watched on in silence till he faded from view.</p><p class="calibre10">“Lord Gerd, you have my thanks,” were my honest words.  Had I given in to resisting the lieutenant’s raining fury, Lindell likely would have flown further into a frenzy&mdash;from there, who knows what might have transpired?</p><p class="calibre10">“If you think I stopped him for your sake, you thought wrong,” Gerd corrected before returning to the garrison.</p><p class="calibre10">“That Lindell fellow&mdash;by gum, a loose bag o’ bolts he be, eh?” Raakel commented.  “Right then, I should go hit the sack meself.”</p><p class="calibre10">“My poor swain,” spoke Sheila.  “You had best treat those wounds on your face soon, lest they harry you in the heat of the morrow’s battle.”</p><p class="calibre10">With that, the remaining two left for the tents themselves.  Sheila had not the epiphany of soothing the wounds of an ungraced, it seemed, surgien though she was.  But what she lacked in inspiration, she made up for with consideration, at the very least, even if all she offered were words.</p><p class="calibre10">She was right, though.  I had better wash and salve the wounds, lest my eyes swell or somesuch.  After one last look at the bridge, I descended the hill and made way to the medics’ tents.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf!  Your face…!  What’s happened!?”</p><p class="calibre10">Morning had come, and just as expected, Emilie was aghast at the sight of my sudden injuries.</p><p class="calibre10">“I kissed the ground too enthusiastically, my Lady,” I tried to pass off the situation.</p><p class="calibre10">“You mean you tripped?  No trip would wound you so, Rolf!”</p><p class="calibre10">Of course not.</p><p class="calibre10">Let’s not fool ourselves here.</p><p class="calibre10">While I anticipated that Emilie would respond as she did, I had not the wherewithal to come up with a proper excuse.  More than anything, I wished to avoid sowing in Emilie any seedling of doubt towards the 1st, this very hour being the eve of an important battle and all.  But knowing her, she might have deferred to Gerd had I kept silent.</p><p class="calibre10">“Lieutenant Lindell of the 1st,” I let slip from my lips.  It was no use hiding it now.  “It would seem I’ve earned his disfavour.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Sir Erik?  But why?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Because I am ungraced, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">“What?  All because of that…!?”</p><p class="calibre10">And because he yearned for your affection, and in so doing, lost himself to his base emotions and precipitated the situation before you.  This, of course, I chose not to reveal.  Had Emilie known of such, she most certainly would have partly blamed herself for it.</p><p class="calibre10">But to read of Lindell’s fancy for her just from his manners, and see the jealousy that sprouted from such feelings&mdash;it would seem I’ve grown enough to discern delusions of dalliance when I see it, if I do say so myself.</p><p class="calibre10">Would that I was more so, perhaps I could have showered Emilie with honeyed words of my own affection while we were yet betrothed.  Whether or not the fates would have torn us apart anyway, at the very least I felt shame in not having done for her aught befitting of a fiancé.</p><p class="calibre10">Be that as it may, I could not let Emilie be taken by her own emotions.  She would surely try to declare a protest to the 1st at the earliest, but I foresaw only trouble in doing so.</p><p class="calibre10">“Lady Emilie.  We can ill-afford to stir up strife between the Orders now, not when we’re to join arms in the battle to come,” I stated calmly.  “Victory comes first, before all else.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I know that, all too well, yet…  You cannot expect me to just sit idly by, Rolf!”</p><p class="calibre10">“It will be dealt with once the battle settles.  But at present, more pressing matters demand your full attention, my Lady.”  The mired moment that followed found her roiling in silence. “Lady Emilie?”</p><p class="calibre10">“…Fine, then,” she consented with no small reluctance.</p><p class="calibre10">Too much hinged on this day.  The fording operation sure to decide the battle, the knights who would wager their lives to see it through&mdash;now was not the time to debase the gravity of it all with a play of finger-pointing.  Fortunately, such was not lost to Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">And at the heart of the garrison was Mareschal Tiselius, giving a briefing on the fording operation to come, one that would decide the fate of the month-long struggle for dominance over the Erbelde basin.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p><p class="calibre10">From ahigh, a hill overlooked both the Des Ailes Greatbridge and the fourfold points of deployment leading into the Erbelde’s waters.  Upon that perch were Mareschal Tallien and his Owlcranes gathered, looking on as far below, Mareschal Tiselius herself took position upon the embattled bridge.  Such was necessary to fully dictate the battle there, but alone she was not, for her own Owlcranes stood ready by her side.</p><p class="calibre10">Amongst them could be seen Lindell, a sight not lost to Emilie.  Her eyes cut a gashing glance at his distant form before swiftly turning away.  It would seem she cleared the hurdle, one of putting her emotions aside for the battle at hand.</p><p class="calibre10">Below our overlook at the riverbanks, the columns of forders were already assembled at their respective starting positions.  Four points, four columns: one composed of the 1st Order, the remaining three of our own, the 5th.</p><p class="calibre10">Our boats were finite.  They could not rightly avail the whole of our fording efforts.  But by going afoot instead, we could commit to the operation an unrestricted number of forders.  From their starting positions, it would take nearly seventy passūs of river wading to reach the enemy banks.</p><p class="calibre10">Such unassisted toil is not a strange occurrence for folk who live in bridgeless lands, so long as the rivers themselves are calm.  There are labourers, too, who earn their living like so.  Without boats, they brave the waters whilst carrying passengers upon either their shoulders, or wooden boards as a makeshift litter.</p><p class="calibre10">The Erbelde seemed at present just the kind of river for such folk: its currents were calmed, and at their deepest, the waters reached no higher than the hips.  Fording it would be a simple chore.</p><p class="calibre10">But this was no pastoral scene&mdash;it was a battlefield.</p><p class="calibre10">Our foes were fain to commit every arrow and every spell available to them to stop our charge.  The forders, for their part, had palings and greatshields to defend with, while upon the bridge, the 1st would commence a constant offensive to draw in the foe’s aggression, pulling it away from our vulnerable forders as much as possible.</p><p class="calibre10">The whole of the operation hinged on this tactic, and upon the shoulders of none other than Mareschal Tiselius was borne the responsibility of its command.  But from the vantage of this hill, I discerned not a tinge of ardour upon her expression.  Estelle Tiselius: the master of blades and the whisperer of armies&mdash;not even a decisive battle like this could dare shade or sallow the hale hue upon her face.</p><p class="calibre10">But our own Mareschal Tallien shared not in her mountainous resolve.  Though abundantly divorced from the battle upon his high perch, he could do little to free himself from the anxiety now writ boldly upon his visage.</p><p class="calibre10">The 5th Order he so commanded had little combat experience to call their own, and now they were to be let loose, to gingerly ford a river so dearly defended by a vehement foe.  Of course, that was to say nothing of the 5th’s fatigued condition, or of the fact that some amongst their ranks have never beheld a Nafil before this day.</p><p class="calibre10">The forders stood poised to begin crossing the river.  The reality of it all began to sink in for some as they silently questioned why they were even there to begin with; after all, they were careerist passers-by, not personages of courage.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet it was also true that the 5th stood much to gain from this conflict: to answer the 1st’s call for aid in a month-long battle they could not win alone, and emerge victorious at the end of the day, itself presented no small degree of potential prestige.</p><p class="calibre10">Those who thought as much, and those who thought little of it&mdash;both ventured their first steps into the river.  The battle had begun.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">Mareschal Tiselius’ industry was a marvel to behold.  Under her command, the knightly offensive upon the bridge was as an unceasing torrent, shearing off droves of the foe’s numbers in its course.  The Nafilim were left to perpetually refill their bridge-stationed ranks, thinning out their efforts to stall our forders below.  All was going according to our designs.</p><p class="calibre10">The 1st’s mareschal herself commanded the battle from all the way up to the midpoint of the bridge’s span, verging on the fiery edge of the frontlines.  This was clearly not the stage upon which a commander should play her part, but Tiselius was a hero unbound by conventional wisdom&mdash;this stage was made for her.</p><p class="calibre10">Indeed, Tiselius’ performance saw her rushing headlong into the frontlines, fire-ensorcelled sword in hand.  With but a blazing swing of her weapon, hellfire flashed forth, blasting a ghastly hole through the enemy ranks.</p><p class="calibre10">But it would not remain unfilled for long, for the Nafilim restocked their stations and pulled their fallen back for treatment, all immediate and without a single wasted effort.  Our foes were fain to have their fair share of the spotlight, it seemed.  Yet even for them, their surgiens were limited in count.  And of those precious few who could treat the grievously wounded?  None.</p><p class="calibre10">As such, the Nafilim’s numbers upon the bridge were unable to sustain themselves, and more were called in from elsewhere to fill the void.  All this culminated in the diminishment of aggression upon our forders.  Only arrowfire, scarce and scattered, greeted their approach, but with greatshields to deflect the bolts with, the columns of river crossers made slow but steady progress.</p><p class="calibre10">Mere iron comprised these hulking shields, yet enough odyl coursed through them from their vanguard wielders to be effective in their purpose.  And further bolstered by arrow-repelling palings, not even the foes’ ensorcelled arrows could bear any teeth.</p><p class="calibre10">Our forces were faring well.  By this point, the tangible progress of the forders found them reaching the midline of the Erbelde’s drifts.</p><p class="calibre10">“They might as well hand over us laurels already, why don’t they?” spoke Raakel.  “A mite shame we’ve tasted not a lick o’ the action, eh loves?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Indeed,” Sheila responded.  “The enemy shores are soon be breached, Yoná willing.”</p><p class="calibre10">We held the advantage, that much was true, but I could not, with clear conscience, match my mind to the sentiments of those two.</p><p class="calibre10">“Looks like we’ve a ribbon to deck our first battle with, right Rolf?” said Emilie with high spirits.</p><p class="calibre10">“Ribbons better to tighten our boots with, I’m afraid,” I doubted.  “We can’t count our laurels just yet.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh?  Why’s that?” she asked.</p><p class="calibre10">“Victory is only certain once the winning cries resound, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">“What’s it now?  Don’t ye go waggin’ that tongue like ye know what’s up, me good ninny,” Raakel pricked.  “A bit smart ye were, sure ‘nough, gettin’ us through that maftin’ march like ye did, but that’s naught to be full o’ yerself with!”</p><p class="calibre10">“I merely voiced a generality, Lady Raakel.  But what’s more, the 5th’s forders are slow in their pace&mdash;moreso than Mareschal Tiselius would like, I fear.”</p><p class="calibre10">A closer look at the riverbourne 5th betrayed their ill-endeavoured movements.  As I thought, the march’s toil had exacted from them a toll too steep, and that price was neither lost to Tiselius as she both commanded the battle and checked the progress of the forders below.</p><p class="calibre10">Sensing this unevenness, orders roared from her lungs to Under-Mareschal Behrmann back at the bridgehead.  The old soldier heeded this at once, and after relaying the mareschal’s words down the ranks, the forders of the 1st slackened their wade to match that of the 5th’s.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Slow on account of exhaustion, you mean to say?”  Tallien’s inquiry dripped with resentment.  Choosing the wrong route was a wound to him, and it would seem my words had unwittingly salted that bitter seam.</p><p class="calibre10">“There is that, yes.  But there are yet many within our ranks whose eyes have never laid upon a Nafil&mdash;not till this very moment,” I presented of a different view, for I was not reckless enough to injure our commander’s pride any further.  “That their deeds could ever hope to match the 1st’s expectations was never in the cards.”</p><p class="calibre10">A deflection, I admit, but one that spoke the truth.  Tallien offered only a disinterested scoff  in hearing it.  Turning to Emilie, I continued on.</p><p class="calibre10">“Moreover, for more than a month, the Nafilim host has managed to keep at bay the <i class="calibre3">1st Order,</i> of all armies.  Not once has our foe ceded the bridge, and here they yet hold the line.  They are able beyond our liking&mdash;I cannot fathom they will yield so easily.”</p><p class="calibre10">And as if waiting for my words to finish, a growl of a boom hammered the air.  The origin: the bridge.  Looking down, another hole had opened through the ranks&mdash;those of the 1st, that is.  The work of a Lancea Calōris spell.  It would seem the Nafilim saw fit to bring their <i class="calibre3">wiċċan</i> to the fore.  The timing was conspicuous: they had waited till Tiselius backed off, and with the frontline threat abated, ran the knightly ranks through with a magicked pillar of fire.</p><p class="calibre10">The 1st’s forward press was halted.  Meanwhile, the Nafilim formations regrouped.  Their ranks now optimised, more of their number was reassigned to dealing with our forders, who for their part, had come into range of the enemy’s spellfire&mdash;what was pummelling the river crossers now were not arrows, but powerful magicks.</p><p class="calibre10">“Ach!” groaned our mareschal as he beheld a forder collapsing into the waters.  Solid shards of bloodied ice protruded from that poor soul’s abdomen&mdash;the work of a different spell, the Glārea Pruīnae, fired straight through a crack in the column’s protective paling.</p><p class="calibre10">That column being one of the 5th’s.</p><p class="calibre10">The nearby forders scrambled to get the wounded soldier into a boat, covering it with another paling as it was pulled back to friendly shores.  A valiant effort, but with a horrid wound like that, a doomed one.</p><p class="calibre10">Elsewhere, another mighty spell, the Flagrum Grandinis, was unleashed upon a fording column, this one, too, belonging to the 5th.  A reaching tendril of water snapped across the air, landing a direct hit upon three forders.  In the wake, a head was ripped off its neck.  Instant death, no doubt.</p><p class="calibre10">“That Tiselius!  Why does she tarry!?  There’s a massacre upon our men!  A massacre, damn it all!” came Tallien’s outburst.</p><p class="calibre10">But the sheer artistry of Tiselius’ actions was all but lost to his eyes: down upon the bridge, the hero-dame wagered her own life to minimise casualties upon the knightly forces, while in tandem dictating their every movement.  The Nafilim by all rights should have held the advantage, being the defenders in this contest, but by Tiselius’ valour alone, such advantage and more were firmly in our hands instead.</p><p class="calibre10">Once again, the 1st re-persisted in their push through the bridge.  Meanwhile, an engorged gale slammed into the enemy shores, utterly hewing down a trio of Nafilim soldiers to their deaths: Lūstrāns Ventulus, an aeolian magick, woven by one amongst the fording 5th.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Felicia!” Emilie cried out with delight.  “That was Felicia’s!”</p><p class="calibre10">A lieutenant and commander of the 1st Sorcery Brigade.  The keenest spear, as it were, of all the forders.  My sister, Felicia Buckmann.</p><p class="calibre10">From her staff flew forth two more swordwinds, unmitigated and unrestrained by their master’s unsteady foothold, up to her waist in water as she was.  Her marks avoided the spell by the skin of their teeth, but the effort was useful enough as suppression.  The foes backed off, re-erecting their own palings.  With enemy aggression lessened for the time being, the forders continued their advance.</p><p class="calibre10">From up high, I could not make out Felicia’s expression, but the determination instilled within her movements was to me as clear as day.  Perhaps out of disdain for our Nafilim foes was she so freed from the fear of losing her own life.</p><p class="calibre10">“Good going, Felicia!” Emilie cheered.  “This tides well for us!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hah.  Oi, ungraced.  You pretend well the touting pontiff,” Gerd started, shooting a look at me, “but too bad your words were as hollow as your mitre, eh?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Was that not your sister, my silly swain?” Sheila observed.  “How sweet that a superb sibling as she would assay so, that her beloved brother might know a moment of relief.”</p><p class="calibre10">Only, there was none.  A flicker of foreboding fell upon me.  The scene below.  I peered and peered.</p><p class="calibre10">Something was amiss.</p><p class="calibre10">But what?</p><p class="calibre10">“Dearest swain?  Have you no words?”</p><p class="calibre10">…It can’t be.  The fates conspire!</p><p class="calibre10">“Lady Emilie!  Mareschal!” I yelled with sudden thunder.  “Pray pull back our forders!  Right away!”</p><p class="calibre10">“R-Rolf!?  What are you saying?” asked Emilie, startled.</p><p class="calibre10">“The river!  It rises!”</p>




<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p class="calibre10">“‘Rises’… ye say?  The river?” said Raakel.  “What’s this ’bout, muscle-pate?  Waggin’ that tongue ‘gain, are we?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay!” I shot back.  “We cannot tarry!  Our men, they must fall back immediately!  Lest they&mdash;!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf!  Tame yourself…!” Emilie soothed with urgency.  “None here can issue such an order.  You know that…!”</p><p class="calibre10">…She was right.  Absolutely so.</p><p class="calibre10">Losing my composure was ill enough.  Losing it here, upon a blasted battlefield of all places, however…</p><p class="calibre10">Little wonder that Rolf Buckmann, addle-pated prodigy, remained yet a swain, a cur-pup pouncing at shadows.</p><p class="calibre10">With a deep chestful of air, I stilled the storm inside.</p><p class="calibre10">“My Lady.  The waters have risen by half a digitus.  Little, true, but it won’t stop there&mdash;no, it only rouses the currents all the more.  The forders will soon find themselves fighting the flow rather than our foes.  Left as they are, the waters will surely claim them.”</p><p class="calibre10">Just having water up to his knees is enough to sweep a man off the ground.  The forders were no different.  The river had crept up to their rear guard’s thighs.  And the front?  Up to their waists.  I had no doubt: they would surely be rooted in place, resisting the rising depths, and when the waters surge at last, they would be left to vanish into the murky rapids.</p><p class="calibre10">And along with them?</p><p class="calibre10">Felicia.</p><p class="calibre10">“If there’s any meat to your maunderings, then I would have you explain yourself at once,” Tallien hissed.</p><p class="calibre10">“The proof lies in the risen waters,” I answered.  “Sir, the tributary&mdash;it’s been dammed.”</p><p class="calibre10">The mareschal’s brows furrowed.  “…Dammed?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I must away!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Wait, Rolf!?”</p><p class="calibre10">I bolted from the Owlcranes’ company and slid down the hilled overlook’s slopes, tumbling as I went.  Landing at its base, I bolted forth once again.  My destination: the Des Ailes Greatbridge.</p><p class="calibre10">The war council.</p><p class="calibre10">The map.</p><p class="calibre10">I should have realised it then.</p><p class="calibre10">Also drawn upon it was a tributary cutting away from the Erbelde and running through Nafílim territory.  Damming it would feed the main river, fattening its girth and flogging its flows into a frothing frenzy&mdash;a foul manoeuvre that would pen the end to the tales of Felicia and her fellow forders.</p><p class="calibre10">The bridgehead.</p><p class="calibre10">Behrmann was there.</p><p class="calibre10">Under-Mareschal Francis Behrmann of the 1st.</p><p class="calibre10">Relaying the situation to him won’t do.  Time was scant.  Only the head of the whole knightly host could suffice.  Mareschal Tiselius&mdash;with her direct order, the forders would surely pull back, no questions asked.</p><p class="calibre10">This was it.</p><p class="calibre10">After sprinting with great dispatch, I arrived at the bridgehead.  Death and desperation reigned here, damning every soul into an unceasing whirlwind of violence…</p><p class="calibre10">…and voices.</p><p class="calibre10">Voices demanding coordination.</p><p class="calibre10">Voices requesting treatment.</p><p class="calibre10">Voices reporting situations.</p><p class="calibre10">Voices screaming for the vulnerable wounded.</p><p class="calibre10">A palpable, heated cacophony, one that immediately struck and offended each of the senses.</p><p class="calibre10">The frantic fighters here&mdash;only a moment before was I speaking of them from so high and safe a perch, as if they were curious little ants to be fancied.</p><p class="calibre10">‘You pretend well the touting pontiff.’  Truer have Gerd’s words never been, and they now bit all the more balefully.</p><p class="calibre10">How ashamed I was.</p><p class="calibre10">But shame greater still awaited me were I to tarry any longer.</p><p class="calibre10">I threw myself onto the veritable wall of knights, forcing my way through their bristling ranks.  ‘Sorry’ wasn’t enough for intruding upon their life-wagering war like I did.  Yet those same wagers, and those of each and every forder, had fallen to my very hands.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yield the way!  Yield!” I yelled over the tumult.  “The mareschal!  I must speak with the mareschal!  An urgent matter!  Urgent!”</p><p class="calibre10">Through the bridge I struggled, pushing aside the knights of the 1st.  Where my way was shut, I pried them from whence they fought and squeezed my way through&mdash;at no worse time could the inconvenience of being so large a man rear its ugly face.</p><p class="calibre10">Bathed in the growls and gripes of the victims of my haste, I somehow alighted at her presence: there she was, Tiselius, fresh from stepping back from the frontline, her blushing platinum hair a rare splash of beauty against the death-drab of battle.  Her voice was raised high, dictating the next movements of the frontline fighters and handing orders down the ranks further behind.</p><p class="calibre10">“Damned waif!” came a bitter roar.  “This is no playground!”</p><p class="calibre10">Lindell.</p><p class="calibre10">Paying him no mind, I raised a roar of my own.</p><p class="calibre10">“Mareschal Tiselius!”</p><p class="calibre10">Her gaze darted to me.  “You… why, you’re the swain from the 5th!” said the hero-dame, puzzled but for the slightest moment.  “Leave it for later!”</p><p class="calibre10">A suitable reaction.  Who could blame her?  The surrounding war-storm demanded her fullest attention at every instant.  There was no time to coddle this cur of a swain.  But this time was like no other: it was an emergency.</p><p class="calibre10">“Later is late overmuch!  The river, Mareschal!”</p><p class="calibre10">“…What?”</p><p class="calibre10">“It surges!  Soon!”</p><p class="calibre10">Her eyes widened.</p><p class="calibre10">“Spare us your fanciful spitting!  Any more and I’ll cut you!” came Lindell yet again with a gashing threat.</p><p class="calibre10">The river’s climb had clearly eluded his ken.  Even now, it was rising.  Steadily, but higher still&mdash;a full digitus since I last inspected.  But Lindell was not alone in his unknowing.  Far from it.  It wouldn’t have been strange for even the forders themselves to be oblivious to the creeping peril.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet no moments were left to spare before the straw would break the camel’s back.  Water is fickle.  Rivers even more so.  In the blink of an eye, a slender snake of a stream can swell into a surging, sundering serpent.</p><p class="calibre10">Such was not lost to Tiselius, who peered down to the Erbelde.  Fright then flashed across her face&mdash;she saw, and knew.</p><p class="calibre10">“The enemy has dammed the tributary!  There’s no time; the forders must retreat!” I loudly pleaded again, and her sword answered.  Up it rose, high, for all the 1st to behold.  From her lungs to her lips erupted pure thunder, a voice more vast than her figure could seemingly conceive.</p><p class="calibre10">“Forders, all!  Heed me now!  Withdraw at once!  I repeat, all forders!  Withdraw at once!”</p><p class="calibre10">Shock beset the entirety of the river crossers, their eyes stretched round in light of the sudden order&mdash;Tiselius’ vociferous command had reached them, it seemed.  The exigency in her voice impelled them to action: the 1st’s forders initiated their withdrawal, with the rest soon following suit.</p><p class="calibre10">For her part, Tiselius wasted not a grain of the hourglass.  Her mind back to the battle, further orders flew from her lips.</p><p class="calibre10">“6th Squad, onward!  4th Squad, pull back and recover!  3rd sorcerers, make ready!  The paling must return upon the next shift!”</p><p class="calibre10">Yet those same lips would be lightly bitten, an expression betraying the question that now roiled within her: ‘Why hadn’t I noticed sooner?’</p><p class="calibre10">But time was up.</p><p class="calibre10">The fates sneered upon us.</p><p class="calibre10">The Erbelde’s grip was fast about the forders’ legs&mdash;they could move no further.  The columns’ rear guards, once wading through the shallows, also found themselves barely able to budge, for the shallows were shallow no more.</p><p class="calibre10">Only a scant few minutes prior were these souls making headway across the river.  Now, they were all of them halted, with their swords and staves thrust into the riverbed for support, to better bear themselves against the burgeoning flow.  Unease seized their faces, but the tide, teeming and teeming still, spared them no solace.</p><p class="calibre10">The forders were now trapped.</p><p class="calibre10">To be washed away was inevitable, should they choose to stay and resist the river.  But what else was available to them?  They could not move.  And now the Nafílim were keen upon their plight.  Arrows and magicks were made ready as scythes, and the forders were as wheat for the coming harvest, for they could neither raise their shields nor wave their wands in resistance any longer.</p><p class="calibre10">The yield was bloody and bountiful.</p><p class="calibre10">The mere sight of it left the bridge-stationed brigades aghast.  For half a minute, they stalled, struck.  These knights of the 1st were all valiant fighters, unebbing in their efforts to hold the line for so long a time.</p><p class="calibre10">And so to stand there, bewildered as they were, was a blunder soon to be unforgiven.</p><p class="calibre10">The end of that fleeting, frozen moment found the Nafílim presence thinned upon the bridge.  Time slowed to a crawl as I witnessed all that followed.</p><p class="calibre10">The foes began to fall back from the frontline.  None of ours endeavoured a pursuit.  In the wake of our enemy’s retreat were crates.</p><p class="calibre10">Crates of wood.</p><p class="calibre10">A whole array of them, sitting upon the bridge.</p><p class="calibre10">I pushed through the knightly crowd, and to the frontlines began a desperate sprint.</p><p class="calibre10">‘Spellwaters, to the front,’ I heard.</p><p class="calibre10">Tiselius.</p><p class="calibre10">She was close behind, equal in her haste, yelling, yelling.</p><p class="calibre10">Too late.  Our foes have all fled the bridge.  Arrows flew aflame, aimed straight at the wooden boxes.</p><p class="calibre10">My feet neither halted nor turned heel.  Rather they took me further, over and past those crates, pushing me further into the unmanned span.  Ardent arrowfire formed a glowing canopy overhead.  With all of my strength funnelled to my legs, I rushed under and past it.</p><p class="calibre10">There were others behind me with the same idea.  Tiselius amongst them, of course.  Of the others, I could not discern.  There was no time to look back and know.</p><p class="calibre10">And the crates.</p><p class="calibre10">Thinking further of their purpose was useless.  Their contents were no mystery either.</p><p class="calibre10">Black powder.  Serpentine.  Quickfire.</p><p class="calibre10">The boxes were explosives.</p><p class="calibre10">All of them.</p><p class="calibre10">The air coughed.  The sound of flaming arrows finding their marks.  My ears heard.  My heart sank.</p><p class="calibre10">Thinking further of what would follow, too, was useless.</p><p class="calibre10">Eternity shrank into an instant.  An instant stretched on infinitely.</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre6" /> &nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">An explosion.</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre6" /> &nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">From behind me flashed an ear-splitting sound, a rush of heat, a wall of air.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Gwagh!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">I catapulted through the air, thrown like some ragged toy, only to land upon where else but the enemy banks.  Chips and splinters of timber showered down upon my entire being&mdash;pieces of the Des Ailes Greatbridge.</p><p class="calibre10">Bites and stings harried every nook and corner of my body.  A creature by the name of ‘pain’, but it was no carrion bird&mdash;not yet a corpse was I.</p><p class="calibre10">Death had not taken me.</p><p class="calibre10">If this be his mercy, then there was still much to do.</p><p class="calibre10">My body quivered all about in my laboured attempt to get back on my feet.  This was the opposite bank, the den of our foes.  No good would come from just lying about.</p><p class="calibre10">I scanned through my surroundings, finding little, hearing less.  I was in the thick bowels of a great shroud of dust, and an incessant ringing screeched at my ears.  Nothing could be gleaned.</p><p class="calibre10">Desperation took hold as I rose and wiped the blood coursing over my eyes.  Disoriented, I peered across my environs once more, my glances wending every which way.  Just then, there appeared for an instant a break in the occluding dust.  Through it was revealed a vista&mdash;one that I dreaded the most.</p><p class="calibre10">The bridge was no more.  Shattered.  Unmade.</p><p class="calibre10">The brave souls of the 1st that once fought upon it were now as vagrants, vanquished and left to scatter to the four winds.</p><p class="calibre10">The floundering forders were yet fixed against the riverflow’s fury, their fate it was to be either swallowed by the waters or shot to pieces by our enemy.</p><p class="calibre10">The knights of Londosius.</p><p class="calibre10">Utterly crushed.</p><p class="calibre10">None could feign a look upon the scene and so much as whisper any doubt that the day was lost.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p><p class="calibre10">Dust billowed about in boundless ubiquity, content in its continued suspension.  The veritable depths of an earthen sea, where teemed my foes, and I, their lone prey.  I was unseen, but I could not remain so forever&mdash;I had to spring to action and quit the place soon, before the dust could settle.</p><p class="calibre10">Steadily did the ringing in my ears begin to fade, and in the meanwhile, I searched about for some particular necessities.</p><p class="calibre10">The demolition unit responsible for the Des Ailes’ undoing… they still had to be here somewhere&mdash;likely not far from the foot of the bridge itself.</p><p class="calibre10">I waded through the dust in that direction, soon coming upon a Nafílim group.  Their gear betrayed their purpose: archers charged with firing hot arrows into the explosives that ended the Des Ailes.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet they were restless.  Fracted and fraught.</p><p class="calibre10">The scope of the prior explosion must have soared beyond their expectations, and its dusty aftermath was proving too much to deal with.  In fact, their chain of command might have been paralysed in the time being, for in the murky air, there appeared a Nafíl loitering alone, separated from his unit.</p><p class="calibre10">Visibility was already poor, but the blasting and bellowing tumult of the battle further provided the perfect mask for my footfalls.  No slinking was needed to get up behind my mark.  Once there, I swiftly lunged at his back.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Uagh…!?”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Grounded, I curled both my legs about his arms, restraining them, and wrapped my right arm about his neck in a chokehold.  With my free hand, I seized and wrung the back-left of his collar, and pressed against the side of his neck.  No more blood would reach his brain at this rate.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“…kh…!?  …gk… dh…!”</i> Words, let alone sounds, were failing to leave his constricted throat.</p><p class="calibre10">I maintained the hold for another moment till all strength and strain left my victim’s body.  Quickly then, I divested his limp person of its arrow-quiver&mdash;just what I was looking for.</p><p class="calibre10">But I wasn’t done yet.  I peered about.  It had to be here somewhere.</p><p class="calibre10">Next to the bridge?</p><p class="calibre10">“…There you are.”</p><p class="calibre10">Wooden crates.</p><p class="calibre10">These things&mdash;explosives, to be sure&mdash;tended to be overstocked in their number, and for good reason: one could scarcely predict just how many would be needed to get the “job” done.  They were all stacked in a pile, in the shadow of which I hid the unconscious Nafíl’s body.</p><p class="calibre10">I next hoisted up one of the crates to my shoulder.  Quite heavy, this.  A third of a passus on each of its sides, reaching up to the knee if put to the ground.  Certainly not something for a man to carry all on his own.  Its edge sank and bit into my shoulder, rousing incredible pain, but I could ill-afford to tarry about and complain.</p><p class="calibre10">Now, a horse.</p><p class="calibre10">Before the explosion, mounted personnel had trotted up and down the banks, their charge it was to coordinate the artillerymen in dealing with our forders.  Those same commanders should still be in the area.</p><p class="calibre10">I strained my ears, listening through the ruckus of war for any telltale sounds.</p><p class="calibre10">There.</p><p class="calibre10">Beyond the dusty haze.</p><p class="calibre10">The rhythmic thump and thud of hoof-falls.</p><p class="calibre10">Cautious ones, I might add.  Awfully so, on account of the occluded visibility.</p><p class="calibre10">I waited, just long enough that a break in the dust plumes revealed my next victim’s whereabouts.  Spotting him upon his horse, I crept up to his side.  It was all or nothing&mdash;I sprinted across the remaining distance and threw myself upon him, crate and all.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Aagh!?”</i> yelped the now dismounted Nafíl.</p><p class="calibre10">No time to waste.</p><p class="calibre10">I wrangled the horse and climbed up to its saddle.  Taking its reins into my free hand, I kicked the critter into a full gallop, leaving behind the barks of its former rider.  With newfound speed, I shot out of the mountainous plumes of dust at last, and drove upstream along the bank.</p><p class="calibre10">The Des Ailes.</p><p class="calibre10">When the flaming arrows struck the explosives in that dreaded moment, the bridge was all but doomed.  Utter defeat loomed, but the day was not yet decided&mdash;there was still one more wager to make.  And it was this very wager that had compelled me to run past the explosives like I did, that I might somehow end up in the enemy’s lap and there cast the deadly dice.</p><p class="calibre10">But those same dice had yet to leave my hands.  For that, I headed to a new destination: the tributary.</p><p class="calibre10">From the fraught mire of my mind emerged the map from yesternight’s war council.</p><p class="calibre10">The Erbelde Broadrun.</p><p class="calibre10">At a fork further up that river, the tributary veered off and slithered into Nafílim territory.  Reaching that fork would not take long&mdash;less than three mīllia-passūs separated it from the bridge proper, a punctually closable distance if I made haste.</p><p class="calibre10">From what I recalled of the map, the tributary’s breadth hardly compared to that of its mother stream, but it was nonetheless well-endowed in its own right.  If dammed, its diverted waters would engorge the Erbelde into a raging tide.</p><p class="calibre10">Why in the name of all that is good had I not noticed this sooner?</p><p class="calibre10">Whilst envisioning the fording operation, whilst scrutinising the strategy during the war council&mdash;not few were the times when I could have scried this one fatal detail.</p><p class="calibre10">What’s more, I had not even entertained the possibility that our Nafílim foes might have foreseen our willingness to cross the river afoot.  If I myself could predict that the 1st would hazard such a risky operation, then surely Nafílim minds would have been capable of the same prescience.  That they crafted a contingency plan to answer our foolhardy ploy was painful proof of this.</p><p class="calibre10">Cursing my own ignorance, I stirred the steed to its fullest speed.</p><p class="calibre10">Felicia.  Her fellow forders withal.</p><p class="calibre10">Were they all yet holding on?</p><p class="calibre10">They must be.  They have to be.  This, I trusted, for there was nothing else left to trust.</p><p class="calibre10">Forcing the enemy into funnelling their forces onto the bridge was now all but a tactic lost in its purpose.  But the explosion, the chaos of their own creation, had left the Nafílim chain of command broken along its links.  Thus if the forders could just regain their footing, they may yet survive, whether they then choose to pull back or make for the enemy shores.</p><p class="calibre10">The tributary now came into view, and with it, the Nafílim engineers stationed in its vicinity.  They were poorly defended&mdash;their strategists well-predicted the fording operation, but perhaps they were too prideful to imagine that any of our number would come up this far.</p><p class="calibre10">Arrows whistled past.  I ducked closer to the saddle, maintaining my speed and course both.  Taking it easy here would avail me nothing.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Gegh…!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">An arrow ate into my left shoulder.</p><p class="calibre10">Pain shrieked inside my head.  My vision rattled dizzyingly.  Yet I pressed on.  Nevermind that my right shoulder was in no better shape, it, too, being eaten, but by the sheer weight of the wooden crate instead.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">Just a little further.  A little further!</i> Upon steeling myself with those words, my steed let out a horrible neigh&mdash;an arrow had dived into its body.  And just like that, the poor animal collapsed, throwing forth its own body into the midst of the Nafílim engineers, who all dispersed in every direction to avoid the downed beast.</p><p class="calibre10">Torn from my mount, I quickly collected myself and sprinted toward the tributary.  Further pain raged through my body.  The trauma of falling off the horse must have exacted its price of broken bones.</p><p class="calibre10">Reaching the riverside, I peered down.  By my estimation, the tributary was almost three passūs wide, about the arm spans of two large men.  Its waters were stilled: sacks of sand had been piled high upon it, stilling the flow.</p><p class="calibre10">Swords were drawn&mdash;the engineers were in fast pursuit.  Bracing myself, I leapt down onto the damming mound, the crate of explosives still on my shoulder.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Agh!”</i> I groaned upon landing.  Or perhaps “landing” is too graceful a word.  I was, by that point, beaten and battered to pieces.  But I dared not stop, not while in my head flashed visions of Felicia and her fellows holding fast against the fury of the river.  My heart begged them, each and every one, to bear the Erbelde, if only for a while longer.</p><p class="calibre10">Dropping the crate of quickfire upon the mound, I drew an arrow from the stolen quiver slung about my back.  Coiled about the base of the arrowhead was paper laced with flammables, while yellow phosphorus coated its striker.</p><p class="calibre10">Classic Nafílim weaponry.</p><p class="calibre10">Glad was I to have “stuck my nose” in the books before the march.  Sudden friction upon the phosphorus was all that would be needed to get the thing going.  Indeed, with a strike against the sole of my boots, the phosphorus gave a sharp gasp, and the arrowhead was soon wreathed in flame.</p><p class="calibre10">I looked to the wooden crate&mdash;how fills the explosives within it?  If packed to the fullest, no doubt the thing would flash into a ruthless fireball the very instant I jammed this flaming arrow into it.  But if there was some space within, I may yet be afforded a moment’s mercy.</p><p class="calibre10">What of the bridge explosion?  Was there any time between it and the sound of the flaming arrows striking the explosives?</p><p class="calibre10">I wondered further, but failed to recall.</p><p class="calibre10">How pitiful.</p><p class="calibre10">But no matter.  The black powder filling the crate was to be this fire-arrow’s next meal, and nothing else was on the day’s menu.</p><p class="calibre10">A look up found the engineers arrived and gathered at the riverside.  They were frozen with fright, their eyes fixed upon the ignited arrow in my hand.</p><p class="calibre10">‘Fancy some fireworks, my good fellows?’ I could have taunted, but I quickly purged the thought.  Perhaps a fine line to utter if it were my foes that would be blown away, but here, I stood to be the victim instead.</p><p class="calibre10">No more distractions.</p><p class="calibre10">I jammed the arrow into the crate.</p><p class="calibre10">The sound of splintered wood.  The arrowhead was in.</p><p class="calibre10">At once, I leapt from the mound and into the murk of the tributary.  Right as I hit the water&mdash;</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre6" /> &nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">&mdash;a roar of pure fire.</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre6" /> &nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">The newborn shockwave, being so close, rammed through my submerged body with tremendous force.  A pall of heat pounded the water’s surface, while fierce winds whipped the river’s flow into a frenzy.</p><p class="calibre10">Within those merciless whirls was I, taken along like some discarded rag, utterly helpless against their ferocity.</p><p class="calibre10">The mound, now unmade, spewed its innards into the water, filling the depths with thick plumes of sand.  But now the river was freed, and its renewed flow propelled the sand forth into a veritable landslide.  Like a raging bull, it charged clear into my back, throwing my body about like a leaf made to dance against a sudden gale.</p><p class="calibre10">Or was it my stomach that was struck?</p><p class="calibre10">No longer could I know.</p><p class="calibre10">The torrents wrung me in one instant, and threatened to tear me to pieces in the next.</p><p class="calibre10">What position was my body in?</p><p class="calibre10">Which way was I facing?</p><p class="calibre10">Were my limbs even there anymore?</p><p class="calibre10">These, too, I could not know, just as I could not breathe.  Not even my eyes dared to open: all that they would have seen was a sandy gloom too incomprehensible for my brain to process.</p><p class="calibre10">Fiercely and fiercer still, the tributary surged with waters making their violent homecoming, and I was but a pebble kicked every which way by the stampede as we both rushed downstream.</p><p class="calibre10">But in those fiery flows, there was comfort.</p><p class="calibre10">Comfort in knowing the ploy had worked.</p><p class="calibre10">My sorry state attested to it.</p><p class="calibre10">The string that was my very life threatened to snap at any moment, but my duty was done: I had destroyed the tributary dam.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Gwugh!  Gaegh!  Gaugh!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Coughing.  Gagging.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“…Haa…!  Haah…!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Washed upon the rivershore further downstream, I hungrily gasped for air.</p><p class="calibre10">How long had I been drifting through the tributary?</p><p class="calibre10">Beyond the shore stretched fields parched and plain, while overhead hung the searing sun.  Life seemed all but lost in the land; one could mistake it for purgatory and be rightly forgiven.</p><p class="calibre10">But purgatory this was not, for I yet drew breath&mdash;the pain eating away at every corner of my body was proof aplenty of it.  Where it was most ravenous was my left shoulder, run through with an arrow as it was.  A parting present from the Nafílim engineers back at the tributary.</p><p class="calibre10">Little remained of its shaft.  Well-broken, both it and I, fellow farers through that merciless “swim” down the river.  But this was where we would part.  I clenched the broken arrow in my right hand, and with sudden force…</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Geaagh!!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Tossing it aside, I laid there on my back, spent, lungs heaving up and down from the turmoil.  My mind turned to my beaten body.</p><p class="calibre10">Arms.  Legs.  Still sound.  Or rather, still “attached” is more the word.  My left arm was broken.  Hands&mdash;the little finger of each shared the same fate.  Beyond the puncture wound in my shoulder, many more riddled my body in the form of cuts and bruises.</p><p class="calibre10">My legs… their bones were yet whole.  A sprain was in my right ankle, and a great pain blared from it, but I could still walk.</p><p class="calibre10">And a rib bone was broken somewhere.  Perhaps more than one.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Haa… heagh…”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Even still, I was alive.  A miracle, or close to one.  Generous enough for a man so scorned by the Deiva.  If it was not by Her will that I survived, then by what?</p><p class="calibre10">No answer.</p><p class="calibre10">I lay there, face-to-face with the full sky.  Not a single part of my body did I think to move, not even the tip of a finger.  I was tired.  Drowsy.  Dreadfully so.</p><p class="calibre10">Without a sound, I closed my eyes.</p><p class="calibre10">My mind… I should just let it take flight.  Be free.  Yes.  Perhaps I will.</p><p class="calibre10">My thoughts thinned like a mist before the rising sun.</p><p class="calibre10">My body melted into the soft dark…</p><p class="calibre10">…</p><p class="calibre10">..</p><p class="calibre10">.</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre6" /> &nbsp;<br class="calibre6" /> &nbsp;<br class="calibre6" /> &nbsp;<br class="calibre6" /> &nbsp;<br class="calibre6" /> &nbsp;<br class="calibre6" /> &nbsp;<br class="calibre6" /> &nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">.</p><p class="calibre10">..</p><p class="calibre10">…</p><p class="calibre10">“…Not yet…  Not like this.”</p><p class="calibre10">Hands on the ground, I pushed myself up.  Not once in my life did waking up require so mountainous an amount of willpower.  Back on my feet, I read the arc of the sun.</p><p class="calibre10">“The Erbelde… there yonder, is it…?”</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">Through the wasteland I walked.  Not a single soul haunted the place.</p><p class="calibre10">The hour of eventide loomed, but the sun cared not in its scorching glare.  My gear, once woefully waterlogged, was now as dry as any pebble I stepped upon.</p><p class="calibre10">My armour.  Half of its leathered portions were in shambles, which I tore off to fashion a crude splint for my broken arm.  The ragged rest, I tossed.  Shedding such a burden greatly lightened my body, yet it still laboured forth as if its flesh were of lead.</p>

<div class="calibre6"><figure><div class="calibre6"><img src="https://lightnovelstranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sskvol1illus05-1.png" alt="" height="500" width="350" /></div></figure></div>



<p class="calibre10">Sweat seeped from every pore, worming over my wounds and searing my senses with sharp pain.  Though my “trip” down the river had me swallowing more water than I would have liked, my throat was now coarse and sticky with thirst.  My breaths gasped and grated against the heat, but with every try, my broken collarbone cried out in agony.</p><p class="calibre10">My right ankle, sprained as it was, complained no less.  The arrow-hole in my shoulder sighed excruciatingly.  A wound upon my head unwound, letting blood trickle down my face.</p><p class="calibre10">Horribly harrowed and hurt as I was, I yet walked on, for walking was my only choice.</p><p class="calibre10">“This day… I’ll mark… on every calendar I cross…”</p><p class="calibre10">As I should.</p><p class="calibre10">Few are they who could boast of having survived an explosion from behind.</p><p class="calibre10">Twice.</p><p class="calibre10">On the same day.</p><p class="calibre10">“This tale thrilling enough for you, Emilie…?”</p><p class="calibre10">But I could scarcely imagine a third.  Surely the fates should know to let jests run their course.  Though I suppose I owe them thanks for letting me live this long, what with all these wounds, and all the battering and tumbling through the barbed throat of the tributary, tiny as it was compared to the Erbelde.</p><p class="calibre10">Felicia.  The forders.  Were they saved?  I wondered.  Not much time elapsed between the destruction of both the bridge and the dam.  Less than three mīllia passūs separated the two, a distance I had crossed at full gallop.  Freeing the tributary should not have taken long, either.  All in all, not more than a few minutes.</p><p class="calibre10">Yes.</p><p class="calibre10">I should have made it in time.</p><p class="calibre10">Or at least, I’d like to think as much.</p><p class="calibre10">If they had managed to weather the enemy’s attacks, then surely they must be well.</p><p class="calibre10">They must be.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">For how long have I walked?</p><p class="calibre10">The skies darkened with dusk.  Only the vapid vestiges of twilight spared any illumination…</p><p class="calibre10">…as well as the braziers bespeckling an encampment.</p><p class="calibre10">Off ahead in the yonder, tents and pavilions peeked out of the evening gloom.</p><p class="calibre10">Of course.</p><p class="calibre10">It was only a matter of time before I would meet the enemy’s heart: the tributary wormed through Nafílim lands, and having emerged from it and trundled my way towards the Erbelde, it was natural that I would cross the foe’s garrison at some point.  What’s more, my approach had brought me right to the backdoor, as it were.</p><p class="calibre10">I slinked my way closer, ducking behind bushes along the way.</p><p class="calibre10">A fence.</p><p class="calibre10">I climbed over, my falling feet placing me squarely within the enemy’s dominion.</p><p class="calibre10">But where were the enemies themselves?</p><p class="calibre10">Passing strange.  Only a scant smattering of their number was I able to glean.</p><p class="calibre10">A high hill cast a shadow over the encampment from the latter’s rear face.  Sidling up to the summit, I gave a peek, spotting the Erbelde Broadrun in the distance, coursing through the landscape in a great brushstroke.  Peering down, I found the entirety of the Nafílim garrison splayed before me&mdash;and a sight that stole my breath.</p><p class="calibre10">A raging battle.</p><p class="calibre10">Already, the knightly host had broken into the enemy base.  It would seem the forders had found their footing and crossed the Erbelde.  Met with this flood of knights, the Nafílim were pouring each and every one of their number into resisting the teeming tide.  No wonder there were so few loitering about their garrison’s rear.</p><p class="calibre10">The bridge explosion had certainly toppled the gameboard and the knights along with it.  But destroying the dam had reset the pieces, and the two sides now found themselves locked squarely in battle.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet this was the Nafílim’s heart of operations, and they spared neither their pawns nor their princes in mustering a fierce resistance.  Indeed, the knights had their hands full and more: their entire offence threatened to buckle under the foe’s defiance should a single step be yielded.</p><p class="calibre10">What was left for me to do, then, was to thin out the Nafílim aggression by drawing their number away from the fore of the fighting.  In other words: a bit of deception and disorder.</p><p class="calibre10">I scanned about, discovering four horses reined together.</p><p class="calibre10">Perfect.</p><p class="calibre10">Now I required fire.</p><p class="calibre10">I searched for braziers, an easy task given that dusk had already dimmed the area.  The Nafílim fashioned their night-fires in the form of torches thrust into an iron basket of sorts.  Kicking over one such contraption, I helped myself to four of the lit torches, bringing them over to the horses and tying them to the saddles.</p><p class="calibre10">The animals jerked and jostled at the idea, but their worries found no warrant: after such an eventful day, I knew a thing or two of pain, and was loath to impart it upon another so wantonly.</p><p class="calibre10">Freeing the horses, I goaded them into running wild, to which they obliged, frightened by the fires on their backs.  Across the encampment they galloped, spreading flames throughout the tents they barged through.</p><p class="calibre10">After seeing them off, I stole into an unmanned tent, therein finding quivers packed with arrows, the same sort I used back at the tributary.  Taking one of them along with a bow, I returned to the overlooking hill, and from there let loose a one-man show of flaming shots.</p><p class="calibre10">With my broken arm did I bear the bow, hence the imprecision of my arrows.  But my marks were mere tents&mdash;they would certainly not sprout legs of their own to flee the shots, imprecise or no.  Just setting them aflame well-sufficed my purpose.  The aim was to sow chaos, after all.  And indeed, the harvest was bountiful, with fires cropping up through the corners of the garrison posterior.</p><p class="calibre10">The sight inspired disorder within the Nafílim fighters at the frontline.  It would seem they guessed a flank attack had befallen their domain.  Well, they weren’t exactly wrong.  Only, it was but a broken-armed bloke who solely manned the entire “charge”.</p><p class="calibre10">The knights, for their part, capitalised on the confusion and moved to smite the enemy full sore.  Even from high upon the hill, I could make out the figure of a certain cherry-blonde dame as she braved the raging fray.</p><p class="calibre10">Mareschal Tiselius&mdash;even to this hour and to this point so deep in enemy lands was she fighting upon the frontlines.  Veritable infernos fumed and flew from her spellblade, mowing through the enemy formations to their despair.</p><p class="calibre10">But there was one more within that royal host that caught my eye.</p><p class="calibre10">A dame of flaxen hair.</p><p class="calibre10">From her silversword pealed and cracked webs of lightning, and with just a swing of the blade, laid low the foe’s number.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Emilie?” I wondered aloud.</p><p class="calibre10">The Owlcranes are ever at the mareschal’s side.  By Tallien’s own words, they need not seek battle so eagerly.  So what was Emilie doing all the way out here?</p><p class="calibre10">As doubt danced about in my mind, a shower of sharp ice slammed into the Nafílim horde&mdash;the Glārea Pruīnae spell.  From where it sprung, there stood Felicia with her silverstaff held high.</p><p class="calibre10">“Felicia…  Thank the fates.  You were saved,” I sighed loudly, relieved beyond measure.  My broken collarbone throbbed painfully at the gesture, but I cared little.  My sister was still alive, good tidings to which my heart brimmed with gladness.</p><p class="calibre10">The battle was becoming more precarious&mdash;a checkmate was close at hand.  The knightly host shattered through the Nafílim line, now thinned by my earlier diversions.</p><p class="calibre10">“Right… time to make a move.”</p><p class="calibre10">I heaved my body into motion, throbbing as it was with pain from every possible part, and made my way down the hill.  Fires fluttered all about the encampment in myriad folds and fingers.  Painted red in their heated glow was my wound-riddled face, scanning about the complex with utmost caution.</p><p class="calibre10">Nafílim detachments now coursed about the garrison rear, fooled by my fiery feints.  I eluded their eyes, quietly shifting from shadow to shadow.  I then laid low, searching for my next mark: a mounted Nafíl, preferably armed lightly and well-separated from any other Nafílim soldiers.</p><p class="calibre10">“No, not him… or him.”</p><p class="calibre10">I continued searching, uncompromising in my criteria, until at last, one fit the bill: a cavalier from a detachment of four, lagging a ways behind the formation.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Today’s your lucky day, my man.”</p><p class="calibre10">Through the shadows, I sidled my way up close.</p><p class="calibre10">The day has already seen me stealing a horse only hours before.  I shouldered a burden of the explosive sort then, but this time found me with hands empty and free.  Things should go swimmingly.</p><p class="calibre10">Or so I should hope.</p><p class="calibre10">For however less burdened I now was, my body complained with pain and broken bones.  But it mattered little.  I had only to do what I set out to do, for “doing” was the only thing left to me at this point.</p><p class="calibre10">Corroborating myself with such thoughts, I rushed up to the cavalier’s side.  Our eyes locked.  His face wrung in shock as he instinctively swung his spear down upon me.  But it was overlate&mdash;already, I was within arm’s reach of him.  His swing struck me upon the right shoulder, but with the shaft rather than the spearhead.  With the attack unsuccessful, I seized the Nafíland pried him from his steed.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Aaugh!”</i> came his wild whimper, of which his comrades took heed.  I hastily mounted the horse, turned it about, and whipped it into a full gallop.</p><p class="calibre10">“You!  Stop there!” one of the Nafílim barked as I quickly quit the place.</p><p class="calibre10">“That went well enough,” I muttered in the heat of the moment.  “Practice makes perfect, does it now?”</p><p class="calibre10">Merely repeating my first attempt earned me another steed.  I admit I had the element of surprise on my side, but if that cavalier had been armed with a sword instead, this tale might have ended differently&mdash;and abruptly.  A bit of caution was in order for my next attempt, whenever that may be.</p><p class="calibre10">I continued driving forth my newfound horse, with Nafílim cavaliers giving chase from behind and the main battle bellowing in the distance ahead.</p><p class="calibre10">At last.  The frontlines.  The blazing tip of the sword that was Londosius’ foray into the Erbelde basin.  Just a little further now.</p><p class="calibre10">With a good kick, I urged the horse onward still, straight into the enemy ranks.  No doubt my previous diversions had placed the Nafílim on high alert for further attacks from the flank, but it seemed they failed to anticipate a mounted rush at the rear.</p><p class="calibre10">I ducked low, goading my horse to its fullest speed.  We cut a path through the deceived Nafílim forces, effectively splitting them in half.  None from the knightly host trained their arrows or spells my way.  And with the enemy horde already dispersed between two points within the garrison, I successfully broke through the Nafílim formations and rode back into the midst of friendly forces.</p><p class="calibre10">There I found both Emilie and Mareschal Tiselius, to whom I approached.  In my attempt to dismount the stolen steed, I found my legs too spent to endure the simple task, and so landed roughly upon my knees.</p><p class="calibre10">“What’s this…?  Man’s come from the other side, he did!”</p><p class="calibre10">“The lad’s beaten and bloodied all over.  What hell harried him on the way here…?”</p><p class="calibre10">Out of the din of battle came utterances from fellow Order fighters, surprised at the sudden sight of my return.  Emilie was amongst them, but in lieu of words, there was only utter amazement writ upon her face.</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Twould seem you’ve earned our debts…” said Tiselius, “…Rolf Buckmann.”</p><p class="calibre10">The hero-dame knew of my name?  Perhaps Emilie apprised her of it.</p><p class="calibre10">No.  None of that mattered.  My thoughts were tangled, but one thing was clear: I had made my way back to the Order.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf!” Emilie gasped.  “Good grace, you’re hurt…!”</p><p class="calibre10">“My Lady.  I’m well,” I tried to calm her.  “You needn’t worry.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Not to mine eyes, you are,” came Tiselius’ arrow-shot of an observation.  And its mark was true: no man so bloodied and broken of bones could rightly be well.  Yet such a man must have quite the tale to tell, and for this particular moment, one most exigent.</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m well enough, madame.  But enough of me,” I said, now with more urgency.  “Mareschal Tiselius, pray draw back the left wing.”</p><p class="calibre10">“What’s this now?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Vermin!  You wormed your way out of the woodwork, and now you dare pretend the tactician!?” Lindell cut in, his wrath-filled voice clapping against the air.  It would seem the short-fused lieutenant of the 1st’s Owlcranes had also managed to cross the Erbelde.</p><p class="calibre10">But I did not back down.  “The enemy’s sole line of retreat traces from our left wing up to a hill, and from there exits the encampment proper&mdash;this, I’ve seen for myself upon that same hill ere my return.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Then all the more reason to press the offence!” yelled Lindell.  “Why draw back when we can cull the curs right then and there!?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay.  Deny our foes their retreat and we only make cornered beasts of them.  They would bare their fangs all the more bitterly and make prey of our own men in return.  We cannot chance this; if the enemy seeks retreat, we must yield it to them.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Then yield it, we will,” said Tiselius. “Boris!  Reign in the left wing!  Have the 2nd Squad circle back to the centre; the rest reforms at the rear!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Right away, madame!”</p><p class="calibre10">The mareschal of the 1st, Estelle Tiselius of all people, not only agreed with my counsel, but acted upon it&mdash;swiftly and resolutely so.  This shook and shocked me by no small degree, as I watched this “Boris”, the mareschal’s deputy adjutant, summarily pass down his madame’s orders to the ranks of the left wing.</p><p class="calibre10">For their part, Emilie and Lindell both were taken by the same surprise.  Only, much to the latter’s chagrin.</p><p class="calibre10">“Mareschal!  Pray lend not an ear to that vagrant’s guile!  He is sodden-witted&mdash;an ungraced!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Erik.  Our foes are well-honed and well-positioned.  I’ll not hazard their extermination if it means our losses run overhigh.  We whip them till they whimper on their way, and in their retreat find our victory,” spoke Tiselius with adamant calm.  “This matter is settled.  I’ll not hear further of it from you.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…As you will, my Mareschal,” Lindell lowly folded.</p><p class="calibre10">With her errant Owlcrane grounded, Tiselius raised her silverblade high and proclaimed her next order.</p><p class="calibre10">“Centre brigades, all!  From here we strike the enemy full sore!  Give them no quarter; onward, now!”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ooouuh!”</i> a bright chorus of battlecries bellowed in answer, and the knights were off at once.  With her forces let loose, the hero-dame turned next to Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">“The left wing joins with the centre; the frontlines won’t find our numbers wanting,” Tiselius explained.  “As for me, I make for the entrance of this encampment.  Lieutenant Mernesse, I would have you join me&mdash;and your swain in tow.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Aye, Mareschal,” Emilie saluted before looking to me.  “Rolf, let’s fall back.  We should have the surgiens see to you quickly.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">Closing wounds, stopping blood loss, restoring a measure of stamina&mdash;these and more are possible with mending magicks, but it would take a surgien of superb skill to fix broken bones and grievous injuries.  As such, I saw little point in being seen to, to be frank, so dreadfully cut up as I was, but more pointless again was turning away Emilie’s consideration and concern.</p><p class="calibre10">“Boris, I leave the rest to you,” commanded Tiselius.  “Exhaust the enemy.  Herd them to their route of retreat.”</p><p class="calibre10">“By your will, my Mareschal!”</p><p class="calibre10">“As for you, Rolf Buckmann,” the hero-dame continued, now facing me, “after the day is won, I mean to hear much from you.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, madame.”</p><p class="calibre10">With that, Emilie and I followed the 1st’s mareschal as she began making her way back through the Nafílim encampment, accompanied by a retinue of knights under her command.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">“Lady Emilie,” I called out in the midst of our withdrawal.  “What brought you here to the enemy fields, if I may ask?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Why, you ran off with such haste, I couldn’t help but chase after you!” she smiled.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Chase?”</p><p class="calibre10">Ah yes&mdash;the moment when I first spied the Erbelde’s burgeoning waters.  I broke away from the Owlcranes and made a mad dash off to the bridge; apparently, Emilie was hot on my heels when I did.  And when the explosion happened, she, too, flew over to the enemy shores, along with Tiselius and myself.</p><p class="calibre10">“I <i class="calibre3">am</i> your superior, you know!” Emilie reiterated, beaming and brimming with pride.</p><p class="calibre10">“Were it not for your bravery, Miss Emilie, I fear we would not have wholly delivered the forders like we did,” Lindell slithered in.  “Ah, to behold the beauty of your spellblade in the flesh!  And to stand shoulder to shoulder with you upon the battlefield&mdash;truly am I unworthy of such a benison.  Praises all to Yoná!”</p><p class="calibre10">“…I’m glad to find you so pleasant, Sir Erik.”</p><p class="calibre10">A rather skewed exchange between Owlcranes, this.  One looking upon the other with a gaze engrossed in passion.  The other&mdash;disimpassioned in return.</p><p class="calibre10">By his words, it would seem Lindell followed his mareschal right before the Des Ailes was undone.  From there upon the opposite banks, he, Tiselius, and Emilie worked to suppress the enemy artillery, thereby protecting our forders.</p><p class="calibre10">Truly a feat no mere trio can rightfully call their own, but include amongst them Emilie and Tiselius, the keenest blades in the 5th and all the kingdom respectively, then such a feat would not seem so much a fantasy.  With the explosion having frayed the enemy’s chain of command, no doubt the three capitalised on the chaos and confusion to safeguard our forders, all in the short time leading up to the tributary’s liberation.</p><p class="calibre10">By their bravery were Felicia and the river crossers able to reach the enemy banks, albeit not without casualties.  And through cunning use of the resources available to them, the forders pushed into enemy lines, bringing the battle all the way up to the foe’s camp.</p><p class="calibre10">While discussing such details, our group arrived at the mouth of the foresaid encampment, finding and joining with the knightly forces stationed there.</p><p class="calibre10">“Lieutenant Mernesse, Owlcrane Brigade, 5th Order,” Emilie saluted them.  “I come requesting treatment for my subordinate, Officer Buckmann.”</p><p class="calibre10">“My my… whose cat did you cross, lad?” remarked a surgien team member.  “Right then, come along now.”</p><p class="calibre10">But not another step was taken before a spire of magicked flame shrieked across the evening air&mdash;a Lancea Calōris, aimed straight at Tiselius.</p><p class="calibre10">Impact.</p><p class="calibre10">A boom blasted through our ears.  An eruption of feathery fires, illuminating the twilight.</p><p class="calibre10">But as those fires faded, there remained a light of a different hue: a paling enshrouding the mareschal, one swiftly erected by her sorcerer subordinates just in the nick of time.</p><p class="calibre10">“Enemies!!” roared Lindell, drawing his sword.  “On the fore!!”  To the dusk’s shadows he trained the tip of his blade.  All eyes followed: lurking in the murk was the Nafílim horde.</p><p class="calibre10">“This, I did not foresee…” Tiselius muttered, teeth clenched, “…has my mind’s blade been blunted?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay, Mareschal.  Our steps fall squarely on the enemy’s haunt.  ‘Tis as you’ve said: the lay of the land spans wholly in their favour!”</p><p class="calibre10">“An ill excuse, that!” Tiselius countered, brushing aside Lindell’s consolation.</p><p class="calibre10">Our present forces totalled a meagre score and a half.  The enemy, double that.</p><p class="calibre10">What foul odds.</p><p class="calibre10">But it would seem things had not gone as planned for our foes as well: these ambushers themselves must have intended at first to initiate a flank attack upon the frontlines once our knightly host had pushed deeper into their territory.</p><p class="calibre10">‘The first contact with the enemy heralds the first casualty of battle: our plans.‘  Fewer words ever spoken more truly.  I had the injuries and the day’s happenings to attest to that.</p><p class="calibre10">Tiselius raised her voice.  “Surgiens, pull back!  I’ll handle th&mdash;”</p><p class="calibre10">Instinctive caution shot through us all like lightning.</p><p class="calibre10">I sensed it: a looming presence.</p><p class="calibre10">Terrible.  Immense.</p><p class="calibre10">And from the dark, it sprang, unseen and straight into our ranks.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p><p class="calibre10">Was it mere murderous intent?  Nay.</p><p class="calibre10">A sheering, gnashing assault fast approached us, naked in its violence and ferality.  A blink of an eye, and already was this “bestial” force thundering through our ranks&mdash;and straight for me.</p><p class="calibre10">In a slice of a second, I drew my sword with my yet unbroken right hand.  Through the darkened air, my sword sailed forth, till in the midst of its cutting arc, there appeared before its glinting edge a Nafíl.</p><p class="calibre10">“Wha&mdash;!?” came the assailant’s yelp.  Shock overcame the thought-speed bearer of the “bestial” force as my blade neared its target: the neck.</p><p class="calibre10">But the steel would find no flesh, for its wielder was but I, a man ungraced: there, my weapon was fully halted, little more than a digitus away from meeting its mark.</p><p class="calibre10">And in another slice of a second, there came Tiselius, discerning the situation.  The hero-dame’s silverblade flashed forth.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Syah!”</i></p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Tch!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">The “bestial” Nafílpulled away, avoiding the mareschal’s sword-strike by no more than a hair’s width.  With a leap back, our assailant was immediately rejoined with the other Nafílim.</p><p class="calibre10">“A keen blade, they have…” rang the Nafíl’s voice&mdash;a girl, “…but how?”  Suspicion sallowed her words as she glared straight at me.  This girl seemed quite young, more so than Emilie and I, seventeen years of age as we were.  It would not be a stretch to call her a child even, whose twin daggers she so held ill-befit her image.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet, it was this same image, this same child that had attacked us with swiftness unimaginable.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf!  You’re not harmed, are you!?” Emilie exclaimed, coming up to my side.</p><p class="calibre10">“Not any more than I was, my Lady,” I assured her.  “Such speed.  That Nafíl&mdash;has she bolstered her own body with odyl?”</p><p class="calibre10">“She has, and frightfully so,” Tiselius confirmed.  “Take her for a damsel and she’ll take you to the dead.”</p><p class="calibre10">With those words, the mareschal summoned forth wreaths of flame about her silverblade, the fires snarling thunderously in their spiral motion.</p><p class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre7">“Igneō Trūdendō!!”</strong> roared Tiselius, and with a thrust of her firebrand, hell itself spewed forth in a fell line, blasting a hole through the Nafílim ranks.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ooaagh!”</i> they screamed from within the inferno.</p><p class="calibre10">“There breathes Tiselius, our mark!  Spread and smite her down!” one amongst them commanded.  “Tarry not!  Or a pyre she’ll make of us all!”  It was heeded with all speed, for in another moment, Tiselius was beset on both sides by Nafílim fighters.</p><p class="calibre10">“Not on my watch!” Lindell interjected, and at once, both he and the other knightly underlings of Tiselius clashed with the ambushers, their weapons biting bitterly against each other in sharp symphony.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ggrrgh!”</i> groaned the knights in their outnumbered and increasingly futile struggle.</p><p class="calibre10">“Sir Erik!  Away!”</p><p class="calibre10">Lindell quickly shrank back, and then in his place was Emilie, rushing in with her blade taking wing through the embattled dark.</p><p class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre7">“Ferum Fulgur!”</strong></p><p class="calibre10">But dark was it no more: lengths of lightning fanned forth from her sword, flashing through the Nafílim.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ggaaagh!”</i> The struck handful of foes were together laid low by the lethal levin.</p><p class="calibre10">Elsewhere, the Nafílim magi readied their spells, but were swiftly set upon by Tiselius’ sword.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Seh!”</i> her voice cut the air, answered by death-screams in quick succession.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Eaahh!!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Already had the hero-dame sundered deep into the midst of the belligerents, having at once seen that Emilie and Lindell were perfectly capable of handling the enemy vanguards.  There, her silverblade flew in flowing flashes, finding and felling her foes one after the other.</p><p class="calibre10">“Surround her at once!  Strike in concert!” grated the voice of another Nafílim&mdash;orders boiling with agitation.</p><p class="calibre10">But they were followed nonetheless, and Tiselius soon found herself encircled with blades all around, closing in quick.  Yet this did not stir her in the slightest.  Indeed, she was the eye of tranquillity within a hurricane of chaos, and with neither wasted effort nor delay, she then swept wide her sword, as if to trace a ring through the air itself.</p><p class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre7">“Levis Crematio.”</strong></p><p class="calibre10">Immediately from about the mareschal, there arose a towering whirl-fire.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ggeeaaahh!”</i> so wailed the foes that fell into its flaming walls, both their bodies and their screams fading into ashes.</p><p class="calibre10">Such strength.  Dreadful, yet majestic.</p><p class="calibre10">By her blade alone, thirty Nafílim were slain here.</p><p class="calibre10">I knew it then.  The Des Ailes Greatbridge, from the dawn of the month-long battle till this very day, was never victim to the fury of her firebrand on account of but one fact: the mareschal had heretofore been holding back her flames.</p><p class="calibre10">Estelle Tiselius&mdash;the mightiest amongst all Londosian knights and dames.</p><p class="calibre10">Her swordskill was of another plane, like a living legend, beautiful and fatal.  Tell any that Tiselius, along with just two other souls, had managed to defend a legion of trapped forders, and an undoubting nod would surely be returned.</p><p class="calibre10">But upon the face of that same Tiselius, there flickered a grim regard.</p><p class="calibre10">A danger was sensed.</p><p class="calibre10">One that I shared.</p><p class="calibre10">I quickly brandished forth my sword into the seemingly empty air once more.  This time, again, its slashing course was stopped before the neck of the female Nafílim.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Hah…!!”</i> she gasped, before backstepping away with immediacy.   “…My blade&mdash;how can you see?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’ve my eyes to thank,” I quipped.</p><p class="calibre10">“…So you should,” she returned, “but why still your steel?”</p><p class="calibre10">“The thing stills itself.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Mayhap it needs more thanking!”</p><p class="calibre10">Lightly then did she lunge forth, intent upon another attack.  Deftness haunted her daggers, guiding them into an unbroken flourish.</p><p class="calibre10">That speed, no less phenomenal now than it was prior.</p><p class="calibre10">But I saw through it.  And avoided it.</p><p class="calibre10">Only&mdash;</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Aagh!!”</i> came my clenched howl.</p><p class="calibre10">Ungraced flesh ill-resists magicked fury.  Even if I could avoid the blade, the odyl fraught within it would find me without fail.  As proof, my chest burst open with a gash, a long line clear across my pectoral muscles.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf!!” Emilie shrieked.</p><p class="calibre10">The wound was shallow enough that it did not cross any bones, but much blood was made to course from its ghastly depths.</p><p class="calibre10">I yet had this much blood within me?  An honest surprise.  And now a haze was filling my vision&mdash;not good.</p><p class="calibre10">“What’s this, now…?” the Nafílim girl muttered, taken with doubt.  But I shared none of it in guessing she’d never before crossed paths with an odylless soul such as I, not in her entire life.</p><p class="calibre10">Just then…</p><p class="calibre10">…strikes upon a gong.</p><p class="calibre10">One.</p><p class="calibre10">Two.</p><p class="calibre10">Three.</p><p class="calibre10">Three resounding rumbles from the heart of the encampment.</p><p class="calibre10">At once, the female Nafílim’s face furrowed in frustration.  “…Curses!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Looks like the curtains are coming to a close,” I pointed out to her.</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Twas a play too-brief,” she remarked.</p><p class="calibre10">“Now’s a fine time to exit stage, wouldn’t you say?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Will we meet again?”</p><p class="calibre10">“The playwrights willing.”</p><p class="calibre10">To this, she fell silent, but in the next moment, vanished right before my eyes.  At the same time, I crumbled to my knees.  This was my limit.  Not another step could I endeavour.</p><p class="calibre10">The other Nafílim were now scurrying away.  Looking further across the encampment, I spotted the enemy horde flowing past the overlooking hill.</p><p class="calibre10">They were retreating.  The day was ours, it seemed.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf!  That wound… so much blood…!” Emilie wailed, rushing to me.  “Surgiens!  Surgiens, please!  Over here!”</p><p class="calibre10">From just a little ways off, there stood Mareschal Tiselius, turning my way.</p><p class="calibre10">To her flew an arrow of fire.</p><p class="calibre10">Just one.</p><p class="calibre10">A vengeful present from our parting foes, perhaps?  But it was ill-given, as it struck not the mareschal, but the tent situated just behind her.  Through the canopy the flame-ensorcelled bolt went, landing somewhere within.</p><p class="calibre10">The other knights, seeing this, breathed a sigh of relief.  The foe’s final attack, all but a failure, they thought to themselves.</p><p class="calibre10">But it was a thought eager to betray them.</p><p class="calibre10">Of course the arrow would not find Tiselius.  The Nafílim archers knew as much.  That was precisely why it was made to find another mark: the tent itself.</p><p class="calibre10">I peered through the distance and into a tear within the pierced canopy.</p><p class="calibre10">Hiding there were crates.  The sort with which I was painfully acquainted.  And it was not a meagre few that the tent concealed.</p><p class="calibre10">There were many.</p><p class="calibre10">Too many.</p><p class="calibre10">A whole hill of them.</p><p class="calibre10">I screamed.</p><p class="calibre10"><strong class="calibre7">“Estelle!!”</strong></p><p class="calibre10">Off to her I bolted at once.  A look of menacing horror wrung my face, a dot of desperation within a sea of relief.  But Tiselius saw it and knew.  Eyes wide, she turned to the tent, the target of my attention.</p><p class="calibre10">There, she shared in my realisation.  With all the might her legs could muster, she erupted into a dash towards me.</p><p class="calibre10">Her silver armour.  The paling it provided would save her from an explosion.  But not from its heat.  Not from its shock waves.  And being so close to such a monstrous density of explosives, she would not escape unscathed.  Not in the slightest.</p><p class="calibre10">Tiselius, rushing to me.</p><p class="calibre10">And I, to her.</p><p class="calibre10">In my eyes flickered a reflection most foul&mdash;crates, all aflame within the tent.</p><p class="calibre10">This was it.</p><p class="calibre10">The fates have played their hand.</p>

<p class="calibre10">Knowing of the hell that was to ensue, I took hold of Tiselius from behind right as we passed each other, at once bringing her to the ground and shielding her body with my own.</p><p class="calibre10">How small she was, more than I ever imagined.</p><p class="calibre10">As the ill-placed thought bubbled up in my mind, there burst an ear-breaking boom, bellowing all throughout the encampment.  An unseen force flashed through the air, slamming onto my back with the weight of a giant’s falling foot.</p><p class="calibre10">And then…</p><p class="calibre10">…blackness.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p><p class="calibre10">The River of Lorn Fates.</p><p class="calibre10">At waters’ end, I would there be judged.</p><p class="calibre10">At long last… or so I had thought.</p><p class="calibre10">I yet drew breath, and by no small fortune, woke to find myself lying in bed.</p><p class="calibre10">The medics’ tents&mdash;a familiar sight, this place.  Already had I paid it a visit, namely after drawing Lindell’s ironfisted ire on the eve of the battle.</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh?  Up now, are we?” spoke a nursing aide, peeking in.  “Stay put, will you?  I’ve got someone to fetch now that you’ve awoken&mdash;orders and all.”</p><p class="calibre10">‘Someone’?  Who exactly?  I wondered.  As I thought to ask, I found the aide already gone from the tent.  Likely she had found out who&mdash;or what&mdash;I was, for all gentleness was stolen from her mood, a contrast to my prior visit.</p><p class="calibre10">A still moment dragged by, till another soul came briskly into the tent: the Dame Mareschal Tiselius herself.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf!  Oh gladness, you’re awake!”</p><p class="calibre10">…’Rolf’?</p><p class="calibre10">“My Lady, Mareschal Tiselius,” I saluted, as I began bending up from the bed.</p><p class="calibre10">“At ease, now.  You’ve toiled enough,” said the mareschal, staying my attempt to get up.  She then alighted upon a chair right beside me.  An odd… blush was about her face&mdash;thoroughly tired from the battle, she must’ve been.  “How fare you, Rolf?  Are you in pain?” she asked.</p><p class="calibre10">“I feel something of a fever, perhaps from broken bones.  Otherwise, I fare well enough,” I answered.  “What of you, madame?  Were you wounded yourself?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay, thankfully.  You did well to protect me in that moment, bringing me down and covering me like you did.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I see.  Then I am most glad.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes…”  Her voice faded into quietude.  Curious.  I yielded a blink of puzzlement before she continued.  “…Do you remember calling me?  By just my name?”</p><p class="calibre10">That I did.</p><p class="calibre10">If memory serves, I had spotted a flaming arrow piercing a tent behind her&mdash;one crammed with quickfire crates.  The scream I let out to warn her was but of a single word: “Estelle”, her naked name.</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Twas an ill offence I’ve committed in the heat of the moment.  Please, forgive my insolence,” I entreated her.</p><p class="calibre10">“And you held me close as we were both bent down upon the ground,” Tiselius went on.  “You recall that, as well, I take it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“A-again, my deepest apologies, madame.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ah, so you <i class="calibre3">do</i> remember.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I-I… yes.”</p>

<div class="calibre6"><figure><div class="calibre6"><img src="https://lightnovelstranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sskvol1illus06.png" alt="" height="500" width="350" /></div></figure></div>

<p class="calibre10">A soft laugh.  “…I see,” she said, before reaching up to stroke her own shoulder&mdash;the same I held during my bid to shield her from the explosion.  “It pleases me to see you up and lucid, anyhow.  ‘Twas a whole day you’ve slept through, I’ll have you know.”</p><p class="calibre10">Her lips curved up tenderly.  Was she the sort to smile when incensed?</p><p class="calibre10">“Madame,” I started, my mind turning to matters more urgent.  “The battle&mdash;what became of it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Our foes committed to their retreat, just as predicted.  Some amongst our number insisted on giving chase, but I stilled their steeds,” she explained.  “And that was the end of it&mdash;the battle was won.”</p><p class="calibre10">I let loose a deep sigh of relief.</p><p class="calibre10">It was finally over.</p><p class="calibre10">“Your sister and senior officer both are faring well, I should add,” she said.</p><p class="calibre10">More relief.</p><p class="calibre10">With this, Emilie, Felicia, and I had a victory to decorate our very first battles with.  And from that battlefield, we would make our return, unbroken and unscathed, heads held high.  Well, I can’t exactly say I escaped unharmed from it all, but regardless: we lived to tell the tale.</p><p class="calibre10">“Your solace is much appreciated, madame,” I responded.</p><p class="calibre10">Tiselius paused for a while before speaking up once more.  “…That moment, mere seconds before the bridge was undone.  Do you recall?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I do.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You realised something then, and bolted off to the bank yonder&mdash;all in an instant.”</p><p class="calibre10">“As did you, Mareschal.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Right.  I’m well aware of mine overeagerness, but I must admit, rushing headlong to the other bank like I did&mdash;’twas most ill-becoming of a commander,” she confessed, shaded with remorse.  “My body betrayed the better of my wits.  Before I knew it, I… found myself sprinting for the enemy shore.  But had I not, ‘twould’ve been the final day for our dear forders.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay, madame.  I believe your judgement was most sound.  No commander of right mind would fain to have her own troops be made as scrap-feed for the fishes.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Thank you.  Your words are succour most welcome,” she smiled.  “Yet you thought&mdash;and did&mdash;as I had, am I wrong?  Sooner than I, no less.  And further on, you took quick action on the enemy banks before making for the tributary.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You saw?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Indeed I did.  Upon stolen steed, you raced to the tributary, bearing a full-packed explosive upon that shoulder of yours,” she recounted.  “I saw you then… and resolved to wager our fortunes upon your enterprise.  Thus till the dice revealed their tally did I commit to safeguarding the forders.”</p><p class="calibre10">“A bet you took along with Lieutenants Lindell and Mernesse, yes?  I gather they were able to cross over to the enemy banks as well?” I asked.</p><p class="calibre10">“That’s right.  For some minutes, the three of us harried the enemy artillery, that our forders might know of some relief.  We heard it then&mdash;an explosion from upstream, like a most unexpected drum-strike.  Not too long after, calm returned to the Erbelde, and the forders found their footing once more.  ‘Twas a gamble of much gain.”</p><p class="calibre10">“But not one without its losses.  What of that end?”</p><p class="calibre10">“…Till that time, a third or so of the forders were lost… whether to the waters or to the ire of our enemy.  A search scours the river for their whereabouts as we speak, but to this moment, we’ve turned up naught.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I see…” I said lowly.</p><p class="calibre10">So it came to be that our forces suffered no small number of casualties.  But perhaps that was the best we could have hoped for.  After all, with the Des Ailes destroyed, there was little else that anyone could have done to draw the foe’s fury away from the forders.</p><p class="calibre10">In spite of it, the mareschal could only wring out embittered words from her heart.</p><p class="calibre10">“Would that I were keen enough to previse the Nafílim’s designs in damming the tributary…  ‘Tis a deep regret that ill-relents,” she said, her topaz eyes downcast as they recalled that fateful scene.  “The forders all, they were teetering at their limits.  Any longer, and…”</p><p class="calibre10">And all would have been lost, our forders as pieces wiped away from the gameboard.  Though that thankfully did not come to pass, by Tiselius’ account, it truly was down to the wire.  Paying no mind to the enemy engineers like I did, charging through without a moment’s hesitation&mdash;all had been sound decisions.  The fates would not have forgiven me had I tarried for a moment more.</p><p class="calibre10">“Were it not for you, our defeat would’ve been writ large upon the history books&mdash;disdainfully so,” Tiselius admitted.  “I cannot thank you enough.”</p><p class="calibre10">“A thanks misgiven, I fear,” I proceeded to give my own admittance.  “It was we, the 5th, who were slow overmuch in wading through the waters.  The toll of an ill-planned march was weighing woefully on our backs.  Had we lightened ourselves with a sounder scheme, the day would have been ours and all&mdash;ere the bridge was blown to bits.”</p><p class="calibre10">“That, I wonder.  Would the 5th have arrived at all were you not there to suggest marching under moonlight?” she reasoned.  “Nevermind that&mdash;was it not you, Rolf, who vouched for the better route from the very beginning?”</p><p class="calibre10">“You’re well-informed, madame.  How, if I may ask?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I had Officer Kranz apprise me of it all.”</p><p class="calibre10">‘Kranz’?  Our Gerd Kranz?</p><p class="calibre10">That’s… quite the surprise.</p><p class="calibre10">The mareschal pressed on.  “Pray tell.  What became of you after the waters were freed?  By what fortune did you end up so deep behind enemy lines?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I was… swallowed up by the tributary itself.”</p><p class="calibre10">“When the dam was destroyed?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes.  The fork was appointed with enemy engineers&mdash;I had not the luxury to detonate the charge in safety, not on their watch.  And so I broke through.  I destroyed the dam with as much haste as I could muster, and in the aftermath, I was whisked off by the waters.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…Quite the foolhardy one, aren’t you?  ‘Tis a miracle you’re yet of one piece.”</p><p class="calibre10">“This fool’s flesh is nothing if not hardy, madame,” I admitted.  Perhaps I owe my parents some thanks for it.  Though, they hardly seem fain to lend even an ear to the son they so disavowed.</p><p class="calibre10">“And from there, you infiltrated the enemy camp from behind, played a ploy to pull their numbers away from the battle, and made your return to the frontlines.”</p><p class="calibre10">“That I did, yes.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Such valour&mdash;one most worthy of praise.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…Pardon?” I asked, puzzled.</p><p class="calibre10">“Your actions as recounted&mdash;all taken while severely wounded.  Even then, what we have reaped from your pains is undeniable.  For such bravery on the battlefield, you’ve earned mine applause and admiration both.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Y-you’re very kind, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">A rosy glow then sang upon Tiselius’ cheeks.</p><p class="calibre10">Never could I have imagined her to be the sort to so warmly laud a swain of another Order.  I saw further then why she stood so prominently within the knightly echelons.</p><p class="calibre10">“But of another matter, I should ask,” she began again.</p><p class="calibre10">“Another matter, madame?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Your sword&mdash;with such sleight do you wield it.  How did it come to be, pray tell?”</p><p class="calibre10">…What’s this now?</p><p class="calibre10">“’Sleight’, madame?” I blinked.  “I fear I do not follow.”</p><p class="calibre10">“The technique you so employed upon that Nafíl,” she elaborated.</p><p class="calibre10">“I had merely swung the sword twice&mdash;with but a single hand, I must add,” I answered plainly.  “The other was broken, you see.”</p><p class="calibre10">“So you say.  But mine eyes saw both to be unthinkably superb.  No less than some millions of swings before them could have forged such swordsmanship.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Millions…  Yes.  Thinking of it, that number would be more on the mark.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I-I see,” she stammered.</p><p class="calibre10">If there was one thing I could be proud of, it was in not skipping a single day of sword practice since my earliest days.  Of course, that long chain was broken by this adventure of a battle.  For that, I would have to step up my regime once I return.</p><p class="calibre10">“One more matter,” Tiselius continued.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, Mareschal?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Why did you brandish your blade against the Nafílim?  No doubt full-knowing that it would never reach their flesh in the first place?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ah, that…”  My hands instinctively clenched the sheets.  “I wanted to convince myself.  I wanted proof.  That my blade would not reach them.  Of course, I knew that it wouldn’t, most certainly.  But knowing wasn’t enough.  I had to feel it for myself, with my very own hands.”</p><p class="calibre10">An explanation met with silence.</p><p class="calibre10">“A fool’s fancy, I know, but I&mdash;”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay…” Tiselius interrupted.  “…Yes.  I see now.  Of course you had to.  What else was left to you otherwise?  ‘Tis hardly a fool’s fancy that guides your heart, Rolf.”</p><p class="calibre10">Such soft sympathy, conveyed with a voice most tender in its timbre.  I felt glad then&mdash;that my wayward ways were not lost to the mightiest amongst the kingdom’s knightly court.</p><p class="calibre10">The mareschal then straightened herself up.  Turning to me, with both graveness and a shade of sorrow upon her mien, she began her next words.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf.  By rights, I cannot infringe upon the 5th’s handling of honours.”</p><p class="calibre10">“But of course,” I affirmed.</p><p class="calibre10">“The deeds you’ve displayed in this battle are truly without equal.  Yet, I fear they will ill-bear you any boon to which you are rightfully due.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I should not think otherwise.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…Your lot.  I cannot fathom how difficult it must be for you.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You are most gentle, madame.  But I enjoy myself quite well.”</p><p class="calibre10">“So I see…” Tiselius smiled lightly.  Any expression upon her face would be worthy of a portrait.   “…Rolf.  Suppose I bid you join me in the 1st.  What say you?”</p><p class="calibre10">Words I never expected.</p><p class="calibre10">In pondering the point of her proposal, there came another voice from behind her.</p><p class="calibre10">“W-wait!  Rolf is <i class="calibre3">my</i> subordinate!”</p><p class="calibre10">A voice I knew very well&mdash;Emilie’s.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p><p class="calibre10">Tiselius turned to the tent’s entrance.  “Why, Lieutenant Mernesse!  You’ve come to visit too, I see.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I-I have, yes!  When I’d heard Rolf was awake, I came running as soon as I could,” Emilie explained herself before bowing to the mareschal.  “Forgive me, madame.  I did not mean to eavesdrop.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You’ve done no wrong.  There’s hardly a door under this canopy to knock upon, anyhow,” Tiselius pardoned.  “Nay, I must beg for forgiveness myself.  You are his superior, and yet I could not help but have a few words with him before you’ve had your chance.  I must’ve broken a rule somewhere in mine eagerness.”</p><p class="calibre10">The mareschal then bade Emilie forget any need for apologies, after which she rose up from her chair.</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh, and speaking of forgiveness,” said Tiselius.  “Again, I must apologise to you two for Erik’s ill-conduct.  He’s been handed a censure, if ‘tis any comfort.”</p><p class="calibre10">“A censure, madame?” I asked.</p><p class="calibre10">“For how he madly mistreated you the other night, Rolf,” Emilie explained.  “I told you I’d protest to the 1st, had I not?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Come to think of it…”</p><p class="calibre10">Indeed, Emilie was most incensed upon seeing me so cudgelled on the eve of the battle.  Telling her to put it aside till after the dust had settled was all I could do to appease her, so keen as she was on taking up the matter to the 1st.</p><p class="calibre10">But to think she actually followed through on it.  It would seem Lindell’s pursuit of her heart had met a dead end.  I felt sorry for him, really.</p><p class="calibre10">Well, almost.</p><p class="calibre10">“Ever the wolf shrouded in a sheep’s fleece, that Erik,” Tiselius confided.  “Though I confess, never could I have imagined the man would bare his claws so capriciously…”</p><p class="calibre10">“‘We ought to gain from his immediate death,’ were his words, which he howled whilst acquainting me with his fists, no less,” I recounted to them.  With Lindell’s censure made official, I thought to capitalise on the opportunity and air a warning of this man.  A fellow furtively fraught with malice&mdash;even barring our little tangle, such a truth remained unfaded, one that deigned to be but a blight upon the Order.  “If he’s a wolf as you say he is, Mareschal, then I’d reckon further that he’s of the rabid sort.  A most dangerous one at that, to be frank.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hmm…  Yes.  I’ll heed your measure of him.  Only, he wears the orator’s jerkin just as well as he does the knight’s cuirass; that wolf is well-practised in rousing the packs to his purposes, you see.  That he got off with a mere censure is proof enough of his cunning,” the mareschal revealed.  “His punishment was vain overmuch.  I am sorry.”</p><p class="calibre10">“N-nay, madame…!” Emilie said, flustered.</p><p class="calibre10">Violence against a fellow Order member comes with it grave consequences.  But the exception here is that the target was me, an ungraced.  Little wonder then as to why Lindell’s sentence was as feckless as it was.  In spite of this, Tiselius did indeed task herself faithfully in punishing her own subordinate, something none could deny.</p><p class="calibre10">“You’ve done more than enough for us, fair Mareschal.  We are most grateful,” I assured her.</p><p class="calibre10">“Hearing that frees me greatly,” Tiselius smiled.  “I’ve kept you two long enough.  ‘Tis time I took my leave.”</p><p class="calibre10">With that, the mareschal made way to the tent’s exit, but not before offering up some last words.</p><p class="calibre10">“Be well then, Rolf.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I will, madame.  Thank you,” I returned.</p><p class="calibre10">The exit flaps billowed and swayed as Tiselius disappeared behind them, at which Emilie looked on for a while with silent intent.</p><p class="calibre10">“…’Rolf’, she called you,” Emilie started.</p><p class="calibre10">“That she did.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And since when have you two gotten so cosy, might I ask?”</p><p class="calibre10">“From when I awoke, my Lady.  The Mareschal Tiselius is in the habit of calling her yeomen by their first names, you should know.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And you should know that you’re no yeoman of hers, Rolf,” Emilie asserted.  “…You’re mine, after all.”</p><p class="calibre10">Passing strange for her to say that.</p><p class="calibre10">“But of course, my Lady,” I confirmed.</p><p class="calibre10">To have my name known and so remembered by the keenest blade in the kingdom filled me with delight.  But delight was all it was, really.</p><p class="calibre10">“…You were awfully desperate to save her when you did.  Why was that?” Emilie inquired.</p><p class="calibre10">“The Order cannot abide losing any of its commanders,” came my obvious answer.</p><p class="calibre10">“She was wearing armour, you know.  I scarcely believe she would’ve needed another set&mdash;one as big as you, at least.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay.  Were she not low to the ground, not even her armour could have saved her from the blast wave.”</p><p class="calibre10">“But… nevermind,” Emilie desisted.  A peculiar look had been on her face, one rather… ‘unbecoming’ of her, if that’s the word.  “…That reminds me, Rolf.  The 1st shall remain here for a while longer yet, but the 5th heads home on the morrow.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I thought as much.”</p><p class="calibre10">What occurred in this battle, feats and faults all, would have to be recorded and re-investigated with great scrutiny.  Drafts for the Des Ailes’ reconstruction would also have to be drawn up, after all details concerning its destruction and the damage to the surrounding area were collected.  Once that’s done, troops would have to be organised and stationed throughout Erbelde basin.</p><p class="calibre10">“Cleanup”, as it were.</p><p class="calibre10">The Chivalric Orders are all effectively the military wings of Londosius.  Fighting is but a facet of a knight’s office&mdash;he must hone his acumen for such mundane business just as much as he does his own blade.</p><p class="calibre10">The 1st would remain busier yet for the time being.  But the 5th, with no official obligations to the river basin themselves, were free to return home, now that the curtains had fallen over the hard-fought battle.</p><p class="calibre10">“Except for the injured; they’re to remain till they’re well again,” Emilie explained.  “That includes you, Rolf.  Be good and get well soon, all right?  And then come back when you’re able.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I will, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’d like to stay if I could, but Mareschal Tallien wouldn’t heed my request.”</p><p class="calibre10">“It won’t do to tarry here just for me,” I reasoned.  “You needn’t worry.  I’ll return soon enough.”</p><p class="calibre10">“If you say so,” she answered.  “I should get going myself.  There’s a meeting for the return march soon.  Take care, all right?  And no swinging that sword of yours till you’re well again!”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’ll give it my all, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">With that, I rested my head deep against the pillow, looking at Emilie from the side of my eye as she made her way out of the tent.  Before she made herself absent, however, I found her halted by the exit.  There she stood, taken with a wordless and unmoving while, after which she turned to me.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…” she called softly.  “…Um…  About what Mareschal Tiselius said earlier… about joining th&mdash;”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m not going anywhere,” I interrupted, purposeful in my discourtesy.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Even if she approached you again?” Emilie re-inquired.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…I see.”  Her visage softened.  “Right then, off I go.  Come back soon, Rolf!”</p><p class="calibre10">And with a smile, she left the tent.</p><p class="calibre10">For as long as I can, for as long as I am allowed, I would stay by her side.  This I resolved to do, and with the decision made, I let my eyes fall to a close.</p>
