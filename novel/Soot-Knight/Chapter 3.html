<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ten were gathered in the stateroom at the Margrave Ström’s mansion.  Astride the long meeting table they sat, with the lord himself at the head.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">On one side was seated the visiting envoy of the Zaharte Battalion, comprising its most central members.  Nearest to the margrave were Viola and Theodor Östberg.  Elder sister and younger brother they were, and as well, the free company’s respective captain and vice-captain.  Ulrik and Sigmund were the other two, brutish men who both chafed about in their chairs.  Four figures total, all looking in the second decade of their lives.  But for however young they were, theirs was a mettle of mighty measure, pillars upon which was held the housetop of Zaharte’s name.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Across from them sat the other five guests: the Fiefguard commanders and—furthest from the margrave—Felicia herself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Such be our present plight,” so concluded a commander’s briefing.  He then leant forth, clasping his hands together.  “Any questions, Captain?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Meeting his gaze was Viola Östberg, upright of posture and crowned with tufts of rich russet hair trimmed to a short, boyish length.  Fair was her face, but bejewelled with sagacious eyes most beseeming a leader of so esteemed a band of mercenaries.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Withal I sense much cause for concern in this ‘acting commandant’.  His treachery intrigues,” spoke Viola with flowing eloquence, who then turned slightly to her side.  “What think you, Theodor?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Why, very much the same, good Sister,” assented the vice-captain.  Like his elder sibling, Theodor’s tresses were of an earthen hue, but longer by a degree.  Tall was his stature, straight and somewhat slender, whilst his own face seemed gentle as it breathed a benign air.  “What’s his name again?  Rolf?  Rolf Buckmann, is it?” he wondered aloud.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“It is,” answered a Fiefguard leader.  “He’s fallen in with the Nafílim, if our reports ring true enough.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And by our eyes, a figure alike to his was found fighting in the prior battle,” the margrave added, before looking to Felicia.  “Brigadier, if you will.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For a little while, she sat paused.  “&#8230;’Twas when the fore of the Fiefguard’s file had nigh-gained the gates of Balasthea,” Felicia began hesitantly.  “There I gleaned a far figure sallying forth to engage the vanguard… with a mien seeming to match Rolf Buckmann’s.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And how certain was your sight?” Viola asked her.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Certain enough, Captain,” the margrave answered in Felicia’s place, “for she is none other than Buckmann’s own blood-sister.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Sister?”</i> Viola almost gasped.  “Dear me…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For a moment, mercy mingled in with the sharpness of the Zaharte captain’s gaze.  Unbreakable was the bond and trust she shared with her own brother, thus it astounded Viola to behold a like bond, but of an unlike strength: lesser, and languishing in languor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia fidgeted with unease.  “N-nay, that man—that <i>figure:</i> it looked to me to have felled many a Fiefguardsman… single-handedly.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Her words elicited widened eyes from the Fiefguard commanders, who then turned glances to one another.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That her brother counted amongst the Nafílim blades so bared against Arbel was a bitter reality to Felicia, one she dearly disbelieved.  And so did she cling to clouded uncertainty, wishing for that fighting “figure” to remain naught but an anonymous anomaly.  For though that battlefield had been a far and chaotic canvas, shuddering with no surety, Felicia’s eyes saw one fact true enough: that figure, with sword in hand, was <i>hewing</i> through Fiefguard flesh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such ferocity could not possibly be found in so frail a man as Rolf Buckmann.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oi, quit beatin’ ‘round the bush, yea?  Ain’t got time for puzzles an’ prattle!” barked Sigmund: Zaharte hatchet-man and a boorish blade of a youth.  Yawning next to him was Ulrik, legs crossed and eyes long loitering elsewhere.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Tame your tongue before His Excellency, you…!” came another bark from across the table.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Let it alone,” the margrave soothed his incensed commander.  “These <i>sellswords</i> sit as honoured guests.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sure enough, nestled in his princely diction and demeanour was disdain for these freelances and their foul lot, a fact not unfound to the Östbergs.  The Zaharte Battalion boasted regard high enough to count nobles amongst their frequent clientèle, and being ever the duo to deal with such silver-spooned patrons, Viola and Theodor had, by now, grown keen to their muted, malignant mannerisms.  Subtleties the two were careful never to take open offence to; this, too, was a lesson learnt from many a year of selling their swords.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Your good will gladdens, Excellency,” Viola bowed slightly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ours be a line of business more begging skill than civility,” Theodor chimed in.  “So we are as we are: a band of brutes, not least these two fine fellows of ours.  But bid us battle and boons be upon you, good Lord.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Following their superiors’ words, Ulrik curled his lips up in a smirk, whilst Sigmund sang in scornful laughter.  Felicia could but knit her brows at such a scene.  In the Östbergs was refinement enough, but for the two grisly grunts, not one dam could stay her displeasure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No matter.  The margrave had made the point himself.  Sellswords are truly an off-shot strain of Men; there is no helping such hawkish souls.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Then I’ll not mince words,” Felicia began again, having quelled her discontent.  “My brother, Rolf Buckmann—he has not in him an iota of odyl.  Even with sword in hand, he is of small succour in battle.  The figure I saw, then, cannot be him.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Not an iota, you say?” Viola asked, cocking her head in confusion.  Answers were offered by the Fiefguard commanders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Not one.  This Rolf Buckmann was given no grace of odyl from our Deiva.  Hence is he unfit for the fray.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Only a portion of our personnel is bedecked with silver, for certain.  Still, a slight against reason it is to think an ungraced should gain aught against any of our men, let alone cut them down.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A snicker then scratched at the stifled air.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“No odyl doled t’this dastard, is it!?” Ulrik echoed, before blasting laughter out from his throat.  “I right guff’d t’that, I did!  Hahah!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Amidst the noise, the Östberg siblings looked to each other, wheeling their many cogs of careful thought.  At length, Theodor turned to the rest and proposed the next step.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The fled soldiers of the fort nevertheless attest to the acting commandant’s turncoating, no?  That best serves a base lode to all our plans here on, I say.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“My brother speaks aright,” Viola followed.  “Nevermind the ungracedness of this ‘Rolf Buckmann’, nor his apparent presence in the prior battle.  What now presses us most is amidst the Nafílim, there breathes a treacher with troves of knowledge—as to the lay of this fief-burgh and its Fiefguard defenders.  We ought train all caution to this account.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Zaharte captain’s point was as precise as it was painful, not least to the Fiefguard commanders, who all sat still and sombre.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Hitherto were the Nafílim empty of intelligence on Arbel.  But with Rolf in their ranks, such no longer held true, for sure enough, after having assumed charge of Balasthea did he hunger for information pertaining to the plight of this march of Ström.  And oh, what a feast he fed upon.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The layout of Arbel was but an appetiser; the main course was the particulars on the Fiefguard itself.  Its make-up, its manoeuvres, its tactics, its tendencies—tastes all savoured and likely remembered to a tittle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The silence hung for a moment more before its breaking by the youngest amongst the Fiefguard leaders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What of parley?  Of discourse?” he timidly broached.  “Might speech sooner avail us than spears…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Parley?”</i> cried a senior commander.  “With that <i>ungraced!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Your</i> speech be madness, you mite-wit!” remonstrated another.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such was the speed of their displeasure that the young leader shrank back.  Still, he went on.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Yet surely our shoulders were loved by levity only <i>after</i> this man took to the post.  And now that it is vacant—now that Rolf Buckmann sets his gaze against us—are we burdened more than ever… that we might buckle to our ruin.  Challenge him, and we well-chisel our own headstones, do we not?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To words weakly spoken and wrung with much strength of shame, the fellow Fiefguard commanders could do naught but bend their brows bitterly in silence.  Pained expressions, as though the truth were stabbing them with sore certainty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Further on did the young commander murmur ruesomely.  “Best we offer him the regular commandant’s seat… and promise him his peace.  Recommend to him an easy return to our ranks, why don’t we?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Recommend” rather than “request”—this seemed the limit of his shame.  But his choice of words only echoed how cornered the commanders all felt, as on and on they sustained their silence.  Acknowledging their plight and peril was the only path forward, but it was pride that jealously stayed their first step.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Till today were they sat comfortably upon Rolf’s shoulders, mocking and mealing him even as he toiled to turn Balasthea’s fortunes around.  Yet certainly enough, it was the great height of his achievements that afforded them a safe perch for the very act.  Indeed, though the commanders did not scorn the battlefield, they well-scorned the man that availed them much advantage upon its fiery spans.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But from today onward was he their foe, much to their aching woe.  The pain was an epiphany: that the man they so disdained was now dealing them the very cards upon which their lives were wagered.  And his was no deck of mercy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But will this ‘Rolf Buckmann’ see the appeal of the parley?” Viola enquired the quieted commanders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Beyond all doubt did Rolf Buckmann seem a man loathing a loving return to the realm of his breeding—not after baring this many blades against its sons.  A parley, too, would prove a poor purse for buying time.  Such was Viola’s thought.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“For my part, I see none, to begin with,” the margrave answered bluntly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“If I may!” Felicia raised her voice.  “Allow <i>me</i> to sway him!  Or at leas—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Brigadier!” growled the margrave.  “Do not take my words for some hollow wind.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Another proposal butchered with all speed.  It was a forgone conclusion to the margrave, absent even his private misgivings for the ungraced man: Rolf was <i>not</i> to be negotiated with.  The sin of high treason hung heavy on that head of his; to extend to him the expiating hand would sully the holy lustre of Londosius.  And with clemency certainly not in Central’s interests, parleying, then, was a path shut tight.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia’s gaze fell.  “&#8230;As you will, Excellency.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Let us touch upon tactics, shall we?” Viola broached anew.  Battle was her main concern, one she wished to quickly confirm the particulars of.  “I propose our company reinforce the Fiefguard’s frailest ranks, whilst a select few of our finest shall sally forth and strike when and where at need.  Might this please Your Excellency’s ears?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“It does,” the margrave nodded.  “But intelligence must be shared between our forces—unbrokenly, and to all detail.  This, I demand.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But of course,” bowed Viola.  “Much gratitude for your heedance, Excellency.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Arbel was blessed with many a grand gate along its walls; which of them the Nafílim horde would assault was a worry to the margrave.  And so long as he and all the others knew not the answer, a force speedy in the response was most appreciated.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Truth be told, the margrave was very much warm to the idea of reining in the Zaharte grunts under his Fiefguard’s command, though little abated was his coldness for having to play along with the sellswords’ tactics.  Still, Arbel and more were on the line, and clear even to his eyes was the superior worth of Viola’s plan.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A rush of air.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And following it, a chair groaning against the granite floor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Eyes turned, finding Felicia asudden on her feet.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Your Excellency,” she said sternly, “pray allow me to join the battle.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;I’ve allowed you once,” the margrave began answering, “but twice I’ll not brook, for your position be <i>perilous,</i> Brigadier.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“My Lord, I beg of you!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The spark of desperation was in her ruby regard.  And deeper in it, a sisterly concern that was not so… <i>simple.</i>  Not to the margrave, no.  For his own eyes saw in her a sibling bond nigh-bordering on obsession.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">An aberration she was, then.  The thought grew on the lord as he looked upon Felicia.  Indeed, an aberration of untold trouble, uncertain and ill-leashed in.  That she shared blood with this new foe was reason enough to restrain her from the battlefield.  But now he did he see more reason to restrict this wild card from all further involvement.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Mind your meddling, Felicia <i>Buckmann!”</i> the margrave shouted.  “The course of this king-given fief hinges on the fortunes of this battle!  ‘Tis not some venue for your family feud!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia winced, hushed by the lordly anger.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Near might be her brother.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Near, and bearing the Nafílim banner, though she wished it not.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But if so, then she must meet him.  Only, she could not.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Amidst the friction of many feelings, Felicia stood with fists white and stiff.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lise looked all along the portcullis gate.  Even with sixty passūs and more spanning between them, its scale left her no less daunted.  Against the mirk of midnight, too, was it shrunk little, for torches were set about its base, revealing it as a maw muffled by a grille of metal and hemmed in by an armour-like arch of stone.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It was but one of Arbel’s many gates, and soon to be beset by the braves of Hensen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Many of Londosius’ marches and provinces operate in a manner not unlike city-states.  In one would stand a capital—the fief-burgh, seat of the lord and heart of his rule—whilst scattered about the countryside would be satellite towns and villages, each eking out their due in agriculture and other like trades.  This march of Ström was no different.  Thus to bring Arbel to its knees and smite the margrave would surely precipitate the fall of the fiefdom itself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Long-burning was the battle waged upon this land.  Only now could its quenching be glimpsed.  And the sole standard to see the next sunrise: the Nafílim flag.  So thought Lise as looming in her heart was a great anxiety.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The very gate in her gaze would be hers to attack, but not on her own, of course.  Marching with her was her own contingent of braves.  At another gate, too, was amassed a separate force, one led by Rolf.  The rest were in the reins of Volker, himself helming the entire operation as high commander.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Of the many mouths of Arbel, four would be struck, and simultaneously, at that.  Such was Rolf’s scheme, but the inspiration was owed to the Nafílim themselves, for on many a past occasion had they employed like stratagems against Balasthea.  The swordsman of soot found it quite the fair manoeuvre, enough to reenact it here at so pivotal a battle.  Its effectiveness was attested against Rolf himself in his time as Balasthea’s commandant.  To have it surface again was his way of admitting such, and rather openly, earning wry smiles from the Nafílim privy to the irony.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still, more was at stake here, thus were changes in order.  Two, three concurrent targets was the norm for the Nafílim, but not so for this night.  Four was their chosen number; worrisome, yes, that their host should be so divided, but much deliberation saw more handsomeness in the reward than hazard in the risk.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Arbel’s interior roads were many, but those connecting the four targets were not laid with efficiency in mind, as from one to another needed quite the trek.  Should word and alarum be sent from the foresaid gates, the Fiefguard would find much friction: messages would travel slowly, orders received belatedly, and reinforcements mustered and moved with great difficulty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The contrary was the crowning advantage for the Nafílim host.  Outside the gates was even and mild terrain, four fine theatres for easy, offensive coordination.  Hence only the defending Fiefguard would be whipped into chaos in the combat to come.  Already were the Men’s numbers culled to their dire disadvantage; now they further stood to be stretched and strained like a fraying string.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No Nafílim mind on that night could have devised such a plan.  The lay of the land, of the fief-burgh—critical as they were, only Rolf had knowledge enough of them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lise began to recall what she had heard.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘True; ours is a superior number.  Attacking straight as we are should pierce the city with pain enough.  But much merit do I find in Rolf’s strategy.’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Volker’s evaluation of the scheme, given to the jarl-daughter after Rolf had headed off to his target gate.  The war-chief could well-challenge the ill-wisdom in spreading one’s forces so thinly, but for Rolf’s designs, he saw little reason to.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘Through all crannies and corners does he seek key advantages, but never does he full-trust to any one.  Wolven, indeed, his wisdom.  Strange, yet intriguing.  His schemes here and at Balasthea prove it clear.’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lise agreed with the war-chief’s every word.  Though if given the choice, intrigue, to her, was most immediately found in Rolf’s swordsmanship.  Those swings, those lunges, those thrusts of his that she had beheld at Hensen and yestermorrow’s battle—all were bladestrokes most beautiful to her eyes.  And it was no fluke, either, for even at the Battle of Erbelde three winters past was she no less a bewildered witness to his sheer skill.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A hero of legend, brandishing his blade and felling his foes—such well-beseemed Rolf’s fighting form.  Merely remembering it brought a fiery fluster to Lise’s cheeks.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;hh!”</i> she gasped.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A flapping fluttered through the air as Lise vigorously shook her head to and fro, catching herself dipped in daydreams unfit for the battlefield.  The sight baffled her nearby braves.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Right.  No time for daydreams.  Berta was watching.  The battle at hand demanded all attention.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Switching gears, Lise peered piercingly at the gate.  Then, with a voice vaulting clear through the night, she cried out her command.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“To the city!  Attack, attack!!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Four?” Theodor thought aloud as he minded the map upon the table.  “Daredevils, much?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Arbel—the Zaharte Battalion had already settled into this fief-burgh, and erected in one of its squares a command centre of their own.  A breeze was blowing, but it did little to lighten the air: as per the sentries, four of the fief-burgh’s gates were being attacked—all at once.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It was but the night following the Fiefguard’s defeat afore the battlements of Balasthea.  A single day, then, was all the Nafílim horde had needed to reignite their momentum.  Hardly strange; their number suffered few losses, after all.  Arbel’s strategists therefore had concluded that in short order would their gates be gained; Central’s reinforcements were days away yet, and the Nafílim knew well enough to strike the city at its feeblest hour.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A prediction proven by this moment.  Still, the devils struck sooner than the defenders would have liked.  Such speed well-presented the horde’s organisational agility, and as well, that their victory at Hensen was no mere whim of the fates.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But there was a queerness to this new commotion: that very horde was now harrying Arbel with forces split in <i>four.</i>  A strategy straining reason.  Why spread so thinly against defenders this desperate?  Theodor asked himself this same question, finding it likely a strategic blunder or some brazen insult.  All along the map he looked as he kept pondering this fortuitous folly, till…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Mm?” he muttered, eyes newly wide.  Comfort turned to caution.  “You see what I see, Sis?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola followed her brother’s gaze.  “North-One and Four… and to the right, East-Two and Four…  Not physically are these gates so distant.  But the roads betwixt seem awfully… <i>scenic.</i>  This bodes ill for us.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ill, for sure,” Theodor echoed.  True enough, the arterial streets connecting the targeted gates wound widely about the fief-burgh’s blocks  Thus was it no fool offence as Theodor had hoped: the gates were chosen specifically to give the defenders as tough a time coordinating as possible.  “The reports rang true, then.  If they’ve scried this far…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…then amongst the Nafílim was someone with much intelligence on the city.  And the most immediate candidate?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>Rolf Buckmann.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Tell of his turncoating feigned no lie all along.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola nodded in agreement.  “Tell me.  What’s <i>his</i> worth in your eyes?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With Theodor’s insight did the Zaharte captain hope to piece together an actionable answer to this development.  Her brother’s was a boon of a brain; ever in times like this did Viola trust to his mind first and foremost.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Worth?  Well, let’s see…  He’s ungraced, for starters.  A proper sting in the pious arse, certainly; mine included.  And a treacher besides, through and through,” he opined gravely, holding his chin in thought.  “Whichever our lot, ever are we all lambs loved by Yoná.  But a black sheep damned by the Deiva Herself?  A rightwise retribution, I say: if it bleats to an alien tune, then it is a beast <i>disbelonging</i> on Her earth—and naught more.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Words, right from my lips,” Viola agreed.  Two lambs, confirming details undoubtable by any from Her herd.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But as for worth…” Theodor went on, “&#8230;my eyes see the <i>wolf</i> under the black wool.  Think on it: Balasthea, delivered in mere <i>months.</i>  This Rolf had a plan and the means to execute it.  As he does against us now, I’m sure.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Oft was the vice-captain taken for a softie of a soldier, and not without reason: meek was his image and elegant was his gait.  His foes, too, were fast in mocking his mild mien.  But they were all of them silenced, and Theodor had their many heads to prove it.  Hence was he keen never to echo their mistake, as Death was wont to wear robes gentlest to the eye.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such sombre thoughts served a foundation for his next words.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Suppose a man, a prolific contributor to the annals of scholastic achievement.  But meet him, and you find him infirm, his every limb long lost to leprosy.  Yet must that diminish his regard?” Theodor expounded, pacing off to the side.  “Suppose another man: a lifelong imbecile.  But behold in a cathedral’s niches many standing statues, marvellous in all their marbled mastery.  And graven upon their pedestals?  His signature, chiselled and proud.  How much of an imbecile is he, then?”  Turning heel, the vice-captain looked to his sister.  “Suppose the same with this Rolf.  Look ill beyond his ungraced label, and we look only into the dark of our graves, I say.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Fair enough,” Viola concurred, folding her arms in thought.  “Then suppose he dons the grand strategist’s garb.  Where might he be amongst these four points?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Theodor shrugged and shook his head.  “My ken can’t scry that far, I’m afraid.  How fares yours, Sis?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“It fares with this finger,” the sister answered, sliding her digit across the map before stopping at the northern edge of Arbel.  Circled in ink: the gates North-One and North-Four.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Why’s that?” asked Theodor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I’ve heard tell he much hates hostilities meted upon Nafílim civilians.  The same be true with plundering; wish it upon Nafílim or no, and you earn his swift rebuke.  Balasthea’s former bulwark-men attest to this,” Viola explained.  “A puzzle of a pate, he has.  But humour his game and we can guess his play.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That being mercy upon Arbel’s meek, I take it?” guessed Theodor.  “If that’s your thought, then certainly the north seems the front of focus.  There is it farther away from the residential district than the east.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Exactly so,” said Viola.  The siblings then nodded together.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The Fiefguardsmen defend North-One most dearly,” the brother confirmed.  “We ought do our part and shore up North-Four with forces of our own.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In answer, Viola wasted no time.  “New orders!” she cried.  “Dispatch Ulrik and Sigmund to North-Four at once!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Saluting, a soldier anear speedily left the scene with her message.  The command centre buzzed anew with activity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ulrik <i>and</i> Sigmund?” Theodor asked his sister amidst the bustle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You heard aright.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The vice-captain’s visage broke with surprise.  A natural response; after all, Ulrik’s and Sigmund’s mettle were unmatched by any other in the free company besides that of the siblings.  Forget the Fiefguard—those two brutes were mountains more menacing than even the standard Londosian knight.  In all the battlefields of their braving have they known naught but triumph.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And on this night was this no more apparent.  Four fronts, four frays—though each theatre was small in intensity, reinforce it with either of these men, and the scales would tip most asudden.  Such was their strength.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But to bring <i>both</i> to bear at a single point?  Theodor frowned, still dim to his sister’s designs.  Rolf had renown enough, sure, but what hunter looses two tigers upon a rat?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Necessity…” Theodor guessed.  “Is that what nags you?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“It is.  Though Reason remains silent,” Viola confessed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Zaharte captain was ever the careful leader.  But this was caution verging on overkill, Theodor felt.  Yet he did little but seal his lips and comply.  A sellsword’s hunch was keener than most, and if one as honed as Viola’s blew alarums at the thought of Rolf Buckmann, then surely would her worries find warrant.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That same captain cast her eyes back down to the map.  Seeing her mien so grave, Theodor thought anew.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola: his blood-sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ever by his side, ever his ally, come what may.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It was she who gave him cause enough to keep the fight.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But in merely fancying her a foe for a moment, Theodor almost drowned in dread.  And that alone was enough for him to feel what Brigadier Felicia herself might have felt.  The vice-captain knew not what fork it was that split the paths of the Buckmann siblings so starkly.  Nevertheless, such partings surely precipitate only sorrow.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>Too much a sorrow for me to bear?</i> Theodor wondered.  <i>Should the day ever dawn where we are lost from one another…  I shudder to think…</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Theodor.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A voice like velvet, reeling him back to reality.  Theodor looked to his sister, finding her smiling gently back.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“It’s all right,” she said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;What is?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Us.  We’ll always be together.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I… don’t recall saying aught—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Straightway, Viola thrust her face close to Theodor’s.  Then, with a tapping finger upon her brother’s breast, broke open a broad smile and said to him:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I hear your heart.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Theodor chuckled nervously.  Never in their many winters together was he ever able to conceal aught from his sister’s ken.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“S-so, will the man himself show up, you think?  This ‘Rolf Buckmann’?” he broached, as though to hide away what blush his sister’s simmering boldness might have teased from his cheeks.  This effort, too, was full-fathomed by Viola, but she humoured him, anyway.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nay…” she answered, drawing back, “&#8230;not likely, at least.  Not at the fray.  Sure enough, we can assume the figure Felicia had espied at Balasthea was not the ungraced himself.  After all, both she and the Fiefguard commanders made their doubt clear: not without odyl could so many foes be felled at once.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A mete point,” Theodor remarked.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Though I rather prefer he rear his face in this fight,” admitted Viola, to which her brother nodded in agreement.  Ulrik and Sigmund were set loose, and not against them both could Rolf ever hope to escape with his hide—not in direct combat, no.  But should the ungraced prove himself worthy of Viola’s caution, well, all the better to behead him at the soonest.  “Whichever way, defeat be his if fight he dares,” Viola continued, “no matter how sweetly the fates may smile upon him.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Along with those words: a hand alighting upon the spear set beside the captain.  Hers was no boast, but rather a blunt assessment.  Whatever teeth and talons the black sheep might hide under his shroud, he would fare not in the slightest against Viola’s battle-zeal, for she was of the Östberg siblings, spear-devouts renowned throughout the realm.  Of fearful note was her weapon, a spear inspiring terrible winds in its wake, a spiteful spire just as famed as its mistress for all the ruin it has wrought.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola’s eyes narrowed.  At once, Theodor sensed a chill in the air.  About his gentle and loving sister, there swirled a stinging, snapping pall.  Remembering anew what violence Viola could easily invite, Theodor inly shuddered as sweat broke out along the length of his back.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nary a cloud marked the moonlit sky.  In its stead was a battle boiling far below, a war waged by night alike to the sacking of Hensen, but unlike in one way: <i>we</i> were the aggressors.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Under my command strove a division of braves, their arms and magicks tasked to the fall of Arbel’s fourth northerly gate.  Certainly curious that the Nafílim should fight by orders of a Man, but with reasoned heads and Lise’s vouching, the arrangement found no resistance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For their part, our foes feigned no strength greater than their due.  Defenders of ill-defensible gates, couching hares harried in concert—the Fiefguard’s diminished numbers were indeed proving a poor dam against our tide of braves.  Soon enough, their mettle failed at last, a development heralded by a long and undulating boom through the air.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In the same moment, amidst the crush and clashes of arms, a call came to my ears:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Commander!  It’s done!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To the gate I glanced.  Beyond the smoke: a massive grille gaping open, marred by many Nafílim magicks.  “We’ve a long way yet!” I cried back.  “Don’t let up!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Unfain for surrender, the Fiefguard salliers then rallied with reinforcements in the portcullis’ passage, fast forming a column to bar our breach.  Their lord’s life was on the line; if his head fell, with it would go the whole of their home, the march of Ström itself.  This, the gate defenders well-fathomed.  Thus did desperation quicken their courage, spur their speed, and give ghastliness to their very gazes.  Bravery burns more brightly in a cornered cur than a complacent lion, and so bracing ourselves all the more, my braves fought forth with all due caution.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Though for my part, caution was the costlier course.  Loath was I to linger in the rearguard and dictate the battle unassailed.  What’s more, my cause laid with the Nafílim now; to walk with them, I needed their trust.  I needed to <i>fight.</i>  Thus did I find myself at the fore of our offence, cutting through the enemy vanguard and laying lightless steel upon their rank-and-file.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It was then that another report reached my ears.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Commander!  Our sister forces’ve gained the other gate!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Understood!” I cried in answer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lise and her contingent, too, sounded to be faring well.  A glad tiding, for on this night, only hers and mine composed the main thunder of the Nafílim’s lightning.  Elsewhere at the eastern gates, Volker played the partisan commander, dictating his two smaller contingents of cavalry in further harrying and drawing out the city defenders.  Such was their sole duty, hence it fell to us at the north to breach the fief-burgh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Hounding the enemy, pouncing upon them at opportunity, and pinning them down in place—a tactic employed by the Nafílim many a time before against the defences of Balasthea… and all with forces numbering but a few.  Under the war-chief’s command, this night saw that exact expertise put on perfect display.  The result: a chaos sown amongst the defenders, one reaped as fruits of advantage by our main forces at the north.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Truth be told, our success hinged upon not two, but just one breach.  It mattered little whether it was my force or Lise’s that entered Arbel first: the sooner invaders were not to charge straight to the margrave’s manor, but rather wind to the other gate and strike the defenders from behind, and from there reunite with the other three forces.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Battlecries crescendoed.  Again the Fiefguard faltered.  Into the streets now spilt the currents of combat.  Rallying, the defenders attempted to array themselves, only to be beset as I broke straight into their file.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Sseh!”</i>  Black steel blasted through air and armour.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Eaaagh!?”</i> screamed a Fiefguardsman.  Blood burst from his bosom as the <i>svǫrtaskan</i> cleaved through metal and bone.  His fresh corpse sparked new fear in his fellow soldiers, who then fled swiftly like spiderlings afore a famished crow.  In their wake was left a gaping hole in their formations.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This was it.  The momentum was ours.  A little more, and—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—the thought severed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">From their rearguard rushed forth a storm of a man.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Rrryyyaaahh!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hn!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sparks flashed.  Shocked steel stung the air.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A hammer-blow of a blade, biting deep into my last-second guard, with power enough to push me back by two whole passūs.  Reeling, I felt in my arms a mad tingle, as though the impact had shaken them to the very bone.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There—now to my side: the blur of a spear, bent on stabbing me through.  I broke away, avoiding the spearpoint.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nay—it was no mere spear.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For it was not retracted as spearmen oft do post-thrust, but shifted straightway into a half-circle sweep, intent on maiming its mark—with the keen axe-blade upon its head.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Spying it for an instant, I bent down low—<i>“Hhup!”</i>—and back-rolled at once.  Hewn air blew above me like a gust.  Yet in danger, I dared another leap back, distancing myself further from the fray.  Fast on my feet again, I stared sharply at my new foes, finding them two in number.  One bore a sword.  The other: “&#8230;A halberd, is it…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A spear with an axe on one face, and at the other, a protruding blade, shaped like the sharpened bill of a bird: the thrice-threatening halberd, seldom seen in Londosius.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">As for the duo themselves, they were clearly not of the Fiefguard rabble.  No; <i>sellswords</i> seemed more on the mark.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hwahhah!</i>  Came to catch the bull by the ‘orns, an’ wot’s this I find!” the swordsman cried, with canines full-bare.  His height reached a mite lower than mine, but brimmed with bulk nonetheless.  Wildly grown was his olive-dark hair, his mien coarse and uncouth.  No doubt he wielded the sword with savagery to match.  “Black ‘air, black eyes!” he barked on.  “A beast o’ a diff’rent breed!  ‘Rolf Butt-mince’, ain’t ya!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I am,” I barked back bluntly.  “Just ‘Rolf’ serves.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Mine was no chivalrous introduction, but a bait.  Of all the fighters in this front, I measured these two the most terrible of them all: hell-hounds to be leashed in, lest my braves fall to their ferocity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I ‘eard ye be too much a babe fer battle, but looks like th’rumours’ve reckoned ye awrong, eh?” spoke the halberdier.  His stature matched his mate’s, whilst about his pate grew a turf of dull-gold hair, all shaved to a wiffle.  Lumber-like were his neck and arms, boasting of all the other brawn hiding beneath his armour.  And if his prior attack was aught to go by, in them was not only power, but deathly precision.  “No matter,” he said.  “Th’bells be tollin’, mate.  Into th’grave with ye!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">As though on cue, the swordsman slowly began to poise himself for the pounce.  “Oh, but let’s ‘ave a bit o’ sport ‘fore the burial, shall… <i>we!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">An explosion of steps.  Such speed—the swordsman swooped in, heaving his hewer down unto me, the strike shouldering a mountain of momentum.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Gkhahhnn!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Blades clashed and clapped like thunder.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I had pride in my physique, but the impact proved heavier than I could handle.  I faltered for an instant, humbled, yet the exchange repeated without relent.  One more strike, and then another—vying metals shrieked in my ears as I guarded against the swordsman’s bear-like blade-swipes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The force of it all trickled down to my very fingertips.  Every swing of his was a waterfall of fury.  But in the violence was revealed vulnerabilities enough.  With patience, I could pierce one of them and land a lethal blow…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…if only this were a one-on-one.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Ffwoohh!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Another howl of hewn air.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The halberd sailed in, not in a stab, but a wide swing helmed by its axe-head.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">As I’d thought: the halberdier was honed of eye and arm, for the sweep of his weapon was aimed squarely at my legs.  A smart target; in bearing myself against the swordsman’s maniacal cleaves had my feet been fixed to the ground.  But with the axe-blade well on its way to them, time was already up: an unscathed escape was impossible.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Vsshrt!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Redness streaked from my leg.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I’d leapt back at the last slice of a second, avoiding the axe-blade but not the odyl wreathing it.  My shin paid with a shallow wound, a fair price for what could’ve been a lost leg.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The swordsman scowled.  “Oi, wot’s up with this wanker, ah?  ‘E should’ve peg’d it ten times by now!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Ere I were thinkin’ I shear’d off ‘is shanks.  Bugger,” said the halberdier, sucking his teeth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The duo’s faces furrowed with fresh caution.  I answered with a reassumed centre guard, keeping them both in my sight as we slowly circled each other.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Mismannered much?” I asked them sharply.  “You had me spit out my name.  Why not return the favour?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hah!” the swordsman scoffed.  “You fancy us knights prim an’ proper-like!?  Well, a fico for you, Bitch-moose!  Names be nothin’ on the battlefield!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yea,” the halberdier sneered threateningly.  “If ye be so keen fer court’sy, why not wring us names out o’ us throats, then, eh?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">These two were quickly proving a pair of barbs, deep on the prick.  But the halberdier—he could be laid low sooner.  Rush in, cut him down in close quarters… a valid gambit.   Decided, I began biding for the ripe moment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Only, there was a rub: the halberdier hardly seemed the one-trick churl.  His thrusts, I could evade.  Their imbued odyl, as well.  But doubtless he’d garnish his wicked menu from here on—likely with post-thrust swings sent straight to my neck.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That halberd of his looked the heftier of its varied brethren.  Dauntingly so.  Its axe-blade boasted both broadness and thickness, an unmaker of armour; wielding so top-heavy a weapon much seemed like leashing a livid lion.  Yet this halberdier was handling that exact feat, to much finesse… and my peril.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But in my hands was a lion of my own, one with no less heft.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A match of mighty arms it is, then.  I’ll not avoid his next attack—I’ll stop it, instead.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Just as the thought finished, a weighty whoosh sounded: the halberd, charging in.  I answered.  Metals clashed and groaned.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hmgh!?”</i> grunted the halberdier, visibly surprised.  Likely a first for him, to be halted by a single sword.  Unceasing, I moved to seize the moment, but the attempt was swiftly cut short.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Khrraaahh!!”</i> the other foe roared, rushing in with a down-cleave from the high guard.  I broke to the side, skirting it by a wide margin.  Distancing myself further from the halberdier, I next trained my eyes to the swordsman, who returned the look.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Come on, mate!  Pretendin’ the turtle?  That your play, Rolf Bint-milker!?” he taunted.  “Even turtles know to bite back!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Do they, now?  Cunning creatures, turtles,” I humoured him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But his point pierced the mark: I had to strike back, lest “Rolf the timid terrapin” be full-writ on my headstone.  That said, dancing with so deadly a duo demanded all caution.  A careless step, and I’d be left a long smear on these streets.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Steadying my breaths, I stared at them anew, seeking the ever-elusive opening.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It was then that a comrade called to me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Commander!  The other gate’s breached!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Good news to my ears, but hardly so for the duo.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Bloody ‘ell!” the swordsman cried with a strike of his tongue.  “Flaccid Fief-cocks, the lot o’ them!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“This is sour,” said the halberdier.  “They’ll be peltin’ in soon fer th’pincer, they will.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He had the right of it.  Lise and her braves were most certainly making their way here.  And once they arrive, any defenders yet lagging would find all escape severed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then best we clean ‘ouse an’ shog off, innit?” said the swordsman, readying himself anew.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Music t’me ears,” the halberdier echoed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The pincer comes, and <i>still</i> you tarry to tussle…” I remarked lowly.  “You both bleat for battle as wasters pine for poppy.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Laughter belched and boomed.  “Aha hahahh!  Says the priest puffin’ the same pipe!” the swordsman retorted, before straightway rushing in to resume our fight.  His diction lingering bitterly in my ears, I resteeled my stance and gripped the soot-steel all the more tightly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　∵　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Time’s up, turtle!  To the butcher’s block with you!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Gkhakh!  Khhaeen!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Bashing blades tolled through Arbel’s benighted air.  Afore me was my frenzied foe, battering away at my guard.  Constraining his every strike was neither doctrine nor discipline; no, his was the sword of instinct, the mind of a fencer fighting by feel.  Such I gleaned as his blade barked and bellowed in from the blindest of angles, nigh-snaring me with each swing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The violence was not solely physical, either, for much odyl trailed and buttressed the swordsman’s storm-like challenge.  A violence that surely would’ve made minced meat out of me were it not for the sword of soot in my hands.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Impact after impact, shock after shock, the force of it all flew from the black blade down to my very bones.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Who’s the bull here…!?” I thought aloud, clenching my teeth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This swordsman—sheer strength was not his only forte, but also the imbuement of his weight into every cut.  My very arms were taking a beating from merely fending off his fury.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Much of my own sword-mettle was moulded in the formal training of my greener days; to face a sword so foreign to that familiar logic was proving my undoing.  His stances, his footwork—all ignored the norms.  Ill-guessing his coming moves, I soon found myself answering his assault either overlate or under-steeled.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But that wasn’t the end of it.  Even were I to scry an opening in the swordsman’s maelstrom, curtailing any capitalisation would be the halberd, sailing in from the side.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To wit:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Off with ye!” cried the halberdier.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Not today!” I shouted, striking aside the thrust and breaking away from any sweep that might’ve followed.  But the escape afforded little respite.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Come back ‘ere, Bush-mouse!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thundering in straightway was the swordsman—unwaning stamina, too, seemed a strength of his.  Our song of swords resumed, in which course glinted the glee of battle in my foe’s fevered eyes.  Mine glared gravely as I watched my opponent with all mustered composure.  Dire though my plight was, I spied some hope, assuming my defence could endure.  For in that moment, I knew at last the method to this swordsman’s madness—and how best to unmake it: this bear of a man was ever borne by the winds of his own wildness, swinging and swinging away with abandon, blind to any secret blade abiding his blunder.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">True, his was a self-smithed style, but that ill-equated to uniqueness, for there were other styles alike to his; namely, those favouring the fatal strike to the exclusion of feints and rebuffs.  Such practitioners wore themselves upon the blade, endowing every slash the whole of their might and momentum.  This foe of mine was scarce different.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Perilous pressure was his game, a gambit to force his foes into guarding, to bear his brunt down upon their very bones and wholly root them in place.  The snared opponent, then, is left with little to do but guard and guard, ever late on the answer and never solaced by a solution.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The weapon to pierce this impasse, then, was naught else but the blade of absolute resolve.  Decided, I continued guarding, seeking the soonest sign of opportunity, a period not unharried by the halberdier as he stabbed and swept from the deadliest of angles and most dire of timings.  Still, I could not break here.  On and on, I awaited the wind of chance, all the while fending off and foiling sword and halberd alike.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Bloody brussen, this weasel!” the halberdier hissed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Aach!</i>  Die already!!”  With that howling cry, the swordsman heaved his blade up to the high guard.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There it was.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The straight-down stroke—my patience paid off.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Aimed at my skull was the blurring sword, imbued with such might so as to split the skies themselves.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My answer: the exact same stroke.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The swordsman’s mien—<i>“Kh!?”</i>—flashed with surprise at my foolhardy hew.  But too late: vertical versus vertical, our skyward swords arched, plunged, and clashed at the subtlest of angles.  Two half-circles, meeting like scissor blades, but the soot-steel’s proved the mightier momentum as it bit the foe-sword’s central ridge.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Khaheeen!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Both weapons plunged further on down, but victorious in the contest, the <i>svǫrtaskan</i> struck the enemy metal against the cobblestones below like a hammer-beat upon an anvilled blade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The “vieglance”—a technique secret and arcane amongst some schools of sword-thought.  And risky besides; glad was I that this first field attempt succeeded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ggwagh…!?”</i> the swordsman grimaced.  Though harrowed by the shock, his hands yet held fast to his hilt.  Only, the higher half of the blade was lost, broken clean by the blacksword.  A most expected outcome; the sheer weight of wolfsteel would’ve exacted no lesser toll.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">From there, I began shifting to the low guard for the follow-up, but glimpsing this, the swordsman did not choose retreat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No.  He lunged forth, instead.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Rrwooaaaa──hh!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Low but unstanced, the soot-steel shot up in response, slicing an up-line on my foe’s cheek.  Skin split open, blood spat out.  But the swordsman ceased little as he drove his pate forth in a headbutt.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Gugh!?”</i> I reeled back, struck straight upon the side of my face.  The swordsman, too, was no less shook as he shambled in place.  Dazed, he dared an indignant scream.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Daaamn <i>yeeuuu!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My sentiments exactly.  This bull of a man was proving a pain in the arse, but such was the naked nature of the battlefield.  All prior practice amounted to mere preparation for this hard-learnt lesson.  I had but to swallow the bitter medicine, to live and turn trial to true strength.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Out th’way, Sigmund!” the halberdier hollered.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Shut it an’ shog off, will ya!?” the swordsman spat back.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The duo seemed more scavengers scrambling for the same scraps than a well-tuned team.  In practice, their play saw little beyond the swordsman handling the immediate fight, with the halberdier simply sniping away at easy openings.  A tactic most serviceable, but hardly stellar.  Had these two meshed any more tightly, I might’ve been pushing up daisies by now.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Tch!”</i> tutted the halberdier, before hastily relocating and launching a stab of his spearpoint.  Disoriented though I was, I managed a deflection with the soot-steel before flying forth immediately unto his midst.  <i>“Uwofh!?”</i> came his dismay.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Over the course of this combat had I scried his scheme.  Not for the mired mêlée was the halberd made.  It instead craved space and breath, away from crannies and corners that might catch it.  For his part, the halberdier had lost his stride: angered at his nuisance of a partner, the axe-sweep was an option lost to him.  The thrust, then, was his sole choice—and my chance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Having closed in, I readied the sword of soot, holding it to the side in a single hand.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hn!!”</i>  The sight of it stirred a light in the halberdier’s eyes.  And then, a smirk: he’d found my opening.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Opposite of his axe-blade was the talon-like barb, one he’d used not once this entire contest.  No doubt to numb my mind to its existence and, at the ripest opportunity, punish my ignorance with it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thus I thought to hand him the opportunity myself.  That barb-blade of his—it lost to the axe in lethality, for it wasn’t meant to lay down the cut.  Instead, it served to snare and snag, exactly as it was doing now to the sword of soot.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At once, the halberdier flicked his wrists to reel in his catch, but before he could, I immediately answered, two-handing the black-hilt.  Easy enough when anticipated; bringing its full weight to bear, I sent the soot-steel straight down—<i>gkackk!</i>—slamming the halberd hard against the cobblestones.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ungh!?”</i> its wielder yelped, falling to the same folly as his mate’s.  But unlike the latter, the halberd was wrenched from his hands.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My mark, now unarmed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I lurched forth at once for the felling.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Yehgh!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Uaafh!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Sshhrr!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Through the paling the <i>svǫrtaskan</i> sliced, and there found the halberdier’s breast.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Gwah…”</i> he groaned grimly.  “&#8230;Bloomin’ ‘ell!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But the man was yet a professional: at the last slice of a second had he retreated, leaving the soot-steel to taste but a shallow cut from his bosom.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oi, Ulrik!!” cried the swordsman.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Sigmund”.  “Ulrik”.  Swordsman and halberdier.  Their names I now knew.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ehgh…</i> yer a dead man, you…!” Ulrik scowled at me, gripping his warm gash as blood dripped from his fingers.  Tightening mine anew about the <i>svǫrtaskan’s</i> hilt, I headed back in for the kill.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But just as my first step stamped, so did the earth tremble—into my ears then rushed a great rumble of hoofbeats.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;Mn!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I halted—now galloping in right before Ulrik’s last rites were many horse riders, severing the space between myself and the wounded halberdier.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ulrik!  Sigmund!  Th’devils be floodin’ in from North-One!” hollered one of the horsemen—and a sellsword comrade, from the sound of him.  “They mean t’flank us!  Come—let’s quit this grave whilst we can!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lise and her braves were right near, then.  Met with the bitter report, Ulrik and Sigmund both turned their stinging stares to me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;A stalemate,” Ulrik hissed as he hurried on up to horseback.  “Thass all ye’ll savour from this!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sigmund followed suit, giving me one last glare before mounting a different steed.  They weren’t wasting any time; a moment, and my two foes were whisked away, leaving me in the dust.  And just like that, the herd of horsemen hasted away into Arbel’s bowels.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…A “stalemate”.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So reckoned Ulrik of our contest.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I stood there, silent and reckoning quite differently from the halberdier.  Had we went on as we did, victory should’ve been mine, surely.  But those men were of a particular lot.  For them, life and death decided the score.  And so long as they yet drew breath, ours remained a draw: not before one side was extinguished could this battle know its end.  Such was what their fiery eyes told me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Commander!” called one of my braves, who, too, had been battling anear.  “Have you taken wound!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Just a scratch,” I answered.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Our gazes next trained to the receding sellswords, finding in their tow a rush of fleeing Fiefguardsmen.  The nightly offence was a success; the Nafílim flag, too, should fly soon above this gate.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Forgive us,” the brave said, turning to me.  “Our aid was ill-lent.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I shook my head.  “Nay.  To each soldier, his own duty.  There’s naught to forgive.”  Airing those words, my thoughts bent back to the battle.  I was convinced anew: that duo’s was a strength mountains above the Fiefguard grunts.  And as though to settle my suspicions, emblazoned upon the sellswords’ saddles were designs of crossed spears: the emblem of the Zaharte Battalion.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No cog in the machinations of war can wheel long without knowing so infamous a name.  And the two I’d just fought: likely they were of the band’s upper echelons, if their comrades’ haste in awaying them served any sign.  At their top, then, should be the Östberg siblings: two-fold spear-devouts renowned throughout the realm.  And if the rumours were right, those twin spears fought in flawless unison—doubtless a more lethal threat than my prior opponents.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“More spiders to this web than I’d like…” I thought aloud, looking up to the night.  There, the waning moon was beginning its ascent up the eastern reaches.  Without knowing why, I then found myself fixed upon its pale brilliance.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Beneath benighted skies was a little girl, gazing up at the flame-felled townscape of Hensen.  It was till not a day ago that she was sheltered in a settlement elsewhere, hid from the hungry eyes of marauding Men—but not from souls of solace: Hensenite soldiers, they were, who had come to deliver the last living vestiges of her village.  Thus was she saved and whisked away to this fólkheimr.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But in her time with them, she saw the soldiers’ spirits grow pale with great unease, for it happened that on the same day, the winds of war had reached their own home of Hensen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What she, her saviours, and her fellow refugees had found at the fólkheimr, however, were but the fading embers of that battle, with the Mennish invaders all slain or long fled.  A section of the townscape was scorched to ruin, but that in itself was a miracle.  Worse could have transpired: the whole of Hensen, sinking into seas of flame, its folk either felled or carted off in manacles.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet such did not come to pass.  Indeed, though few were lost, none were snatched away.  None at all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Much relief this brought to the little girl.  For whilst Hensen was spared, her own home was not.  Oh, the horrors that had unfolded in its unmaking.  Nightmares she wished dearly never to see again.  Not here, not anywhere.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But now safe in the walls of Hensen, she began to look for a certain soul, who she was certain was come, as well.  Yet wheresoever she searched, her efforts found no fruition.  A kin of Man, of likeness unalike to the Nafílim folk—such was the soul’s semblance, sure to strike the eyes from amongst the crowds of Hensenites.  But struck her eyes were not.  No matter how far she wandered, no matter how long she looked.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">She tried enquiring her saviours of the soul she sought, but to no avail.  They knew naught and—regular rank-and-file that they were—knew neither that this very person had, in truth, dealt Hensen the dear hand of deliverance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But when asked in return for the name of this person, the little girl could not answer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For it was unknown to her.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A soul unforgettable, yet unnamed—the weight of that woe now sat more heavily on her heart than ever.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Up at the surrounding townscape she looked once more.  Its burnt and blackened husk hid the fortunate fact that few folk were slain, yet bared most nakedly the brutality of the battle itself.  Was <i>he</i> safe?  Spared from the swords and spells of that battle?  Within this fólkheimr that was, to <i>him,</i> a veritable fastness of foes?  This, she wondered.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And as she did, thoughts of the worst scenarios welled up from within.  A nightmare most morbid, a fancy most affrighting, an end most dark—just imagining them well-made her ready to claw away at her own bosom.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Oh, how she wished for <i>his</i> well-being.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For his living breath, for the mercy of the fates upon his hard-lived lot.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But to the little girl, tragedy was an ever-chasing chariot.  She had grown weary of wishing, fearful of believing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet <i>he</i> was different.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Never did <i>he</i> stop believing.  Never did <i>he</i> surrender, nor deceive, nor damn <i>himself</i> to remorse.  <i>He</i> was as a lodestar, showing her, <i>teaching</i> her that hope was not to be abandoned, that wishing yet had its worth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thus dearly did she wish to believe.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Dearly did she wish hers a heart yet fain for faith.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But always would the woeful shadows spring up from the depths of her bosom.  To tear away at her.  To torment her to all tiredness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Were that her heart had strength enough to weather such wiles.  This, she wistfully thought, and in so doing, she looked up to the soot-black sky.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not yet did she know.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That to this moment still was <i>he</i> fighting.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Confronting the killing fray for a gentler future, for a promise made.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Up the waning moon went.  Up and up through the eastern mirk, a slow, white star wheeling to the west.  In the little girl’s eyes did such splendour show.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Would that <i>he</i> could see the same.  What gladness, what joy would she know.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such was her one wish upon that night.</p>
