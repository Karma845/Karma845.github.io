<h2 style="text-align:center;">Ⅱ</h2>

<p>“Good to meet you, Mia.”</p>
<p>Glad was I to hear her name at last.  And for such an occasion, common sense dictates that I return the favour in kind.  Only…</p>
<p>“I hear you’re attuned to the covenantal magicks.  And that, well, ‘ill’ awaits me should I tell you my own name.  Though… I certainly would like to, truth be told.”</p>
<p>My words proved to be of little avail, for upon hearing them, Mia but shook her head fleetingly.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Master…” she murmured, “&#8230;your name… please don’t…”</p>
<p>Hmm…  “Master”, is it now?</p>
<p>The ring of it sat rather unwell.  Indeed, I much preferred to be called by name, but alas.</p>
<p>Well-known it was that a thrallspell could be thwarted by one capable with the covenants.  But to a soul enslaved like Mia, there was also danger: were it discovered that she knew and spoke the name of her master freely, then she would surely be disposed of with all haste.</p>
<p>Not by my hands, of course, but by those clad in iron—namely, that of Londosius’ legislature.  Thus, more so for her sake, I could not give her my name.</p>
<p>“Well, I’ll think on it, then,” I relented.</p>
<p>Yet indeed were our eyes met, and her name heard.  There was light at the end of this tunnel, however faint, however far.  But there was little hurry in reaching it.  Softly now, one step at a time.</p>
<p>“Right.  Let’s have supper, then,” I said, rising up to my feet.  “Mia.  How about you make yourself comfortable while I cook something up?”</p>
<p>I pointed to a chair at the dining table.  Mia’s eyes followed.  Only, her feet didn’t.  Not for a while.  During that lull, she stared at it, until at last, she slowly stepped forth and took her seat.</p>
<p>Satisfied at the sight, I stepped forth myself—into the kitchen I went.</p>
<p>It would be a dire lie to say that Mia was in good health.  I knew not how long she’d been captive, but doubtless it must’ve been a most trying time, to say the least, during which none gave thought to her care and comfort.</p>
<p>Thus for her supper, a bowl of porridge, warm and gentle to the stomach.</p>
<p>Just the other day in the markets did I happen upon a pumpkin, sound in its size and scent.  And there was milk available.  On the daily, no less.</p>
<p>It’s settled, then.  For Mia, a meal of mild sweetness: rice pudding, bedight of milk and pumpkin.  With a bold knob of butter melted in, it was sure to be a delight.</p>
<p>Resolved, I set out a pot and went to work.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Wisps of sweet steam swirled through the air as I brought the bowls to the table.  One for Mia, set right before her, filled with rich rice pudding.  Sure enough, it caught her attention, though her stare seemed empty as ever of emotion.</p>
<p>“Mia.  Let’s eat,” I said, sitting myself down.  Yet even then, I found her unmoved.  “&#8230;Mia.  A meal lifts the spirits just as well as it fills the belly, you know.  Don’t be afraid.  Have at it.”</p>
<p>‘Cheer up’ was the gist of what I wanted to say—brash overmuch of me, perhaps.  Certainly her sullenness was not something to be solved with so little effort.  But Mia needed to eat, and that was the simple truth of it.  Only with a body healed can the heart itself start its mending.</p>
<p>Before long, Mia moved her eyes from the bowl and looked to me.</p>
<p>“&#8230;supper…” she began, vanishingly.  “&#8230;Master’s suppertime…”</p>
<p>“Nay, Mia,” I shook my head.  “It’s <i>our</i> suppertime.  Yours and mine both.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;table… same table… why…?”</p>
<p>Words of doubt.</p>
<p>How could a master ever suffer a slave at the same table, and upon the same supper-hour, no less?  For Mia, this was surely a situation most unthinkable.  That any goodwill would ever come her way was evidently a hope long lost to her.</p>
<p>And yet…</p>
<p><i>‘&#8230;why…?’</i></p>
<p>…there was hope, to be found in that one word, verily uttered.</p>
<p>To ask ‘why’ is to express a need for knowledge; there yet remained in Mia a wisp of wonderment for the world.  In other words, she still had the will to live.  Buried beneath her bosom, it smouldered on, tiny and dim.  And it would be my duty to seek it out and have her awaken to its warmth.</p>
<p>“Supping at the same table means we’re friends, Mia,” was my answer.</p>
<p>“&#8230;but I… I’m a slave…” she reasoned.</p>
<p>“And I’m the son of a noble house—disavowed, that is.  And a soldier of a fort nearby, as well.  Ah, and I live by the blade and like to indulge in books,” I told of myself at length.  “What about you, Mia?  What sparks your fancy?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Right.  A topic for another day, then.  Come.  There’s your supper.  Eat up.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;proper food…  not scraps…” she observed.  “&#8230;I can eat it…?  …really…?”</p>
<p>“Of course you can, Mia,” answered I, with mildness.  “Carefully now.  It’s quite hot.”</p>
<p>Soon enough, she very gingerly took up her spoon, dipped it into the rice pudding, and brought the spoonful into her mouth.  And—fates be gentle—she repeated it, at last partaking of the pudding, little by little.</p>
<p>I looked on intently, or perhaps in wonder.  But as I did, a question crept up from within: why, exactly, did I buy her?</p>
<p>Mia is a war-slave.</p>
<p>By the throes of war, waged between Man and Nafílim, she was made to bear the manacle.</p>
<p>And myself?</p>
<p>What else am I but a kin of Man?  A willful participant in that war, duty-bound to fight Mia’s own kin?</p>
<p>Indeed, within all that I’ve wrought may be found some inconspicuous deed, now the provenance of her pitiful plight.</p>
<p>Did I buy her, thinking to atone for it?</p>
<p>I very well should’ve known—always, even—that for as long as war was my livelihood, my actions would beget many others not unlike Mia: sufferers of fates most forlorn.</p>
<p>But knowing ill-amounts to beholding.  Was the burden made unbearable only after I had seen for myself where led the long course of my deeds?  If so, then I was but a wayward waif, a fool blind to his own folly.</p>
<p>Or…</p>
<p>Was this revenge?</p>
<p>A hateful strike against a hateful world, so willful as it is in rejecting my very being?</p>
<p>An act of vengeance, veiling itself as compassion for a little girl, who so suffers the same scorn that I do?</p>
<p>Should that be the way of it, then Mia, to me, would merely be a means to an end.  Incorrigible, yes.  Dreadfully so.  And yet, I could not bring myself to wholly deny it.</p>
<p>On and on I set upon my soul these confounding questions.  Moments mired in self-doubt as I watched over Mia taking a pudding-decked spoonful to her mouth, slowly on in silence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Humble this abode may have been, but it was, in the end, a residence reserved for the respectable commandant of Balasthea.  Thus was it hardly strange that the house had a guest room of its own—one I’d never availed myself of, admittedly, for not once have I had to welcome a staying visitor through my doors.  But so much the better, for this home now housed two.</p>
<p>“Use this room, if you will, Mia,” I said, showing her inside.</p>
<p>“&#8230;?”</p>
<p>Little about my words seemed to make sense to her.</p>
<p>“It’s yours from now on,” I reaffirmed.  “And as well, over there—a bed for your bedtime.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;room…?” she asked timorously.  “&#8230;I don’t… need a room… or a bed…”</p>
<p>“No, Mia.  You very well do.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;but…”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry.  I’ve not used this room once myself.  Besides, no one should be without a bed.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I can sleep… in a cellar… or outside…”</p>
<p>“As can I.  Out in the fields, up on the rocks, everywhere’s a bed, really.  But this home has all the creature comforts, and so I sleep on a bed of sheets and pillows—just as you should, Mia.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>Was it right to take her reticence as acceptance?  To know not was panging proof of my witlessness for common communication.  But to be witless <i>now,</i> of all times?  Self-pity stung more by the second.</p>
<p>Down beside Mia I knelt.</p>
<p>“Mia.  Resting in itself is also a duty to be done.  No matter your means or your lot in life,” I attempted again.  “And when you sleep, it’s best to do so on a bed.”  Finding her unchanged, I rose back to my feet.  “Right.  It’s your bedtime.  But if you need aught, just say the word.”</p>
<p>With that, I left the room, letting off a deep sigh upon shutting the door behind me.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>A new day dawned over Arbel.  The sunlit chirps had yet to be lost within the stir of the streets sure to come.  In that dewy hour was the sound of a door creaking open.</p>
<p>“Mia,” I greeted from the kitchen.  “Good morning.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;good morning…”</p>
<p>A proper response.  Awfully timid still, but one of no small relief to me.  Heartened, I began putting the last touches on our breakfast.</p>
<p>“Have a seat.  I’ve got some soup ready.”</p>
<p>A glad sight it was, seeing Mia rightly sit herself down.  Before her, I set her share of the morning’s meal: a warm bowl of soup, some slices of fresh-baked bread, a helping of halved figs, and a mug brimming with milk.</p>
<p>I then took my own seat opposite of her.</p>
<p>“Right.  Let’s eat.  Breakfast is important, you know.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>A lull upon her lips.  But not for long.</p>
<p>“&#8230;many thanks… for this meal…”</p>
<p>Thanksgiving—ostensibly a custom unique to the Nafílim, said before and after each and every meal.  Gratitude expressed for both the bounties of nature and the great pains taken to put them to the plate.</p>
<p>None amongst the Londosian citizenry found either prudence or profit from such a practice.  After all, what was to be gained from offering thanks to food that could scarce offer any words of its own?  That was the mind of this kingdom, and one that I shared, to be frank.</p>
<p>Until now, that is.</p>
<p>Only after hearing it with my own ears did the epiphany fall upon me.  Simple words of simple beauty, wishful for serenity, thankful for sustenance.  And so the question was no longer of ‘why’, but ‘why not’.</p>
<p>“Many thanks for this meal,” was my hand at imitating her.</p>
<p>Did I seem the maudlin mummer?  To mindlessly mimick the manners of a foreign folkway?  I could hardly know, but what I did know was that they were good words to utter, and that I was glad indeed to do so.</p>
<p>And across from me was Mia, looking on with a rather curious, if not mesmerised air about her face.</p>
<p>I then broke bread along with her.  A morning meal, muted of conversation.  As always, I’ve never been the sort of man to mislike silence, but this moment found me feeling otherwise.  The quietude was as an empty pit, and there was I, egged on to try and fill it.</p>
<p>Thus did I broach the only thing that seemed fitting at the time.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Fruits for breakfast are a boon to the body.  Did you know that, Mia?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Though I admit, I’ve not prepared any real ones today,” I went on.  “That’s right.  Figs aren’t fruits.  Did you know that as well?  The red bits inside—they’re flowers, actually.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“They bloom inward.  All with not a petal upon them.  Peculiar, aren’t they?  Figs.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>As of yet, no response was had from Mia.  It would seem the finesse of improvisation was also all but dead in me.  I felt then as if I truly knew naught with which to spark in her the slightest curiosity.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Mama…” she muttered out of the blue.</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;‘figs… are fruitless’&#8230;” she then seemed to reminisce.  “Mama…  Mama said it, too…”</p>
<p>“Did she, now?  And here I thought to play the pointed scholar, but I see your mother donned the cap sooner than I could.”</p>
<p>An attempt at levity.  A mask for concern.</p>
<p>‘Where is your mother now?’</p>
<p>A question I had not the courage to ask.  Will the day ever dawn when I could?  And not just of her mother, but of all her loved ones?</p>
<p>This, I wondered.  But for now, Mia’s words were more than enough.</p>
<p>A half-step it was.</p>
<p>Just half.</p>
<p>But a happy half, one closing the distance between us both.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>“&#8230;is there… anything… I can do…?”</p>
<p>A fruit born from much effort.</p>
<p>With pluck and persistence had I been sharing my words with Mia, that she may, given time, share with me more of her own.  Though to be precise, it was more a one-way flow, for she was yet given to timidness and quietude.</p>
<p>But the progress made was undeniable, as evidenced by her innocent question, asked upon the morrow of our fifth day together.  A request for something, anything at all, to do—surely it must’ve grown unbearable for her by then, to have so little to fill her days with besides idle dilly-dallying.</p>
<p>Perhaps I would give her just that.  The timing seemed right.</p>
<p>Mia was, by nature, a child imbued with an independent spirit.  Pure conjecture on my part, of course.  But of late, the feeling was always there: though she yet said very little, I saw in her something of a sprout, slowly, ever so slowly beginning its bend towards brighter rays.</p>
<p>As such, giving her something to do for the mere sake of it wouldn’t have sufficed.  Instead, I would have her do something <i>for</i> me.  A lesson in tandem, to teach her that she was still a soul of value: someone who was needed, someone to be relied upon.</p>
<p>And so, to her, a duty all of her own.  A simple, but vital bit of housekeeping was sure to fit the bill.  Truth be told, a humble, standalone home such as this was hardly in need of a housekeeper.  But I cared not.  The ‘what’ of her job should matter less than the ‘why’, after all.</p>
<p>Housecleaning it was, then.  To be done in the sunlit hours.  I would be away at the fort from morning on, till my return at dusk.  In the meanwhile, Mia’s charge would be to tidy up the house.  And once she has grown accustomed to conversation, I mean to rely upon her some more.  Perhaps with a bit of laundry and the like.</p>
<p>“&#8230;no chains…?”</p>
<p>A question asked asudden.  But of course I wouldn’t chain her up.</p>
<p>I do admit that I had reservations, to leave Mia all alone during the day.  Spending those many hours in solitude was sure to ail a growing child like her, but my choices numbered few.  Arbel was a bastion of Man, after all, and bringing her along with me to Balasthea was certain to beckon trouble beyond my arbitration.</p>
<p>Therefore, the best I could do before my daily departure was set aside some lunch for her.  A meal of bread, assorted fruits, and such.  And speaking of meals, two a day was the common custom, whether it be for the kin of Man or Nafílim.  For my part, I favoured three, and partook accordingly even during my time in the Order.</p>
<p>So it was that I had Mia follow suit.  Three meals a day for the growing girl.  Though truth be told, the mere thought of her having lunch all alone upon that dining table was disheartening enough.  But more disheartening again was providing her too little at so paramount a time: her heart and body both were yet healing, and ample sustenance was key to their corroboration.</p>
<p>To make up for it, I went well out of my way to ensure we shared our breakfasts and suppers together.  And of course, each occasion was an opportunity for conversation: included with every meal were earfuls of prattle on my part.  Stubborn, yes, but it was for her own good.</p>
<p>Yet in all things there are limits, and the same holds true for words.  I knew this well enough, and so endeavoured upon her a touch from time to time.  Certainly, no lady should suffer an unpermitted stroke of the hand upon her person.  But Mia was a special case.  Her heart was woefully broken, and my wits well-convinced me that warm contact was just the remedy needed for its mending.</p>
<p>All well and fine.  Albeit by most measures, my figure was a towering one.  Indeed, I myself had grown into a rather rugged and looming mould by this age of twenty.  And so to Mia, I might’ve seemed the imposing presence.</p>
<p>Hence with all caution paid, with as much meekness of mirth as I could muster, to Mia I would give a tap upon the shoulder, or a touch upon the cheek.  Gestures of gentleness, given upon entrusting some duty to her or thanking her for fulfilling them.  And of course, all with a smile, without fail.</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>Even then, there would be little of what one would call a “response” on her part.  Only, she would often look up to meet my gaze.  And in those amber eyes, I would discover a candlelight of emotion, tiny, quivering, and vanishingly faint.</p>
<p>And there was the hug.  A step above the gestures before, but one I could not commit to.  Somehow, I had the uneasy feeling that an embrace would unearth from her a memory fraught with misery.</p>
<p>To stay myself for her sake.</p>
<p>To task all tact to her consideration.</p>
<p>Kindnesses, these were.  Yet ones only skin-deep.  Ones I wished never to retreat to.  Intimacy is most frightful indeed, but I could ill-afford to be fettered by such fear.  The part of the pale-livered pansy, who paints himself the prudent man by mistaking distance for discretion, was a role I was resolved to reject.</p>
<p>An ill-abled ungraced, a fool of an exile flung to the far fringes of the kingdom—these I may be, but a coward?  Nay.  I cannot and will not entertain cowardice, whether in my conduct or my conscience.</p>
<p>Yet there I was.  Frozen.</p>
<p>The moment: when I was first fain to give Mia an embrace.  But as I came close, a vision stopped me in my tracks.  One of glass, at once whole yet frail, and then fracted into many fragments.  In the end, I relented, petrified.</p>
<p>Once again, I realised that there were still many a hurdle to overcome, and over the coming days, a veritable mountain of dilemmas to deliberate.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>

<p>“&#8230;welcome… home…”</p>
<p>Mia’s meek greeting as I opened the door, now home from my duties at the fort.</p>
<p>Such etiquette likely resulted from the education of the slaver himself.  Still, it was one Mia acted upon by her own free will, a fact none could deny.  And the deed earned no small gladness from me, for it was the first time I’d heard the greeting from her lips.</p>
<p>Already, it’s been two weeks since I’d taken her in; perhaps the frail bud that was her heart had begun to bloom?  If even by just a little?</p>
<p>“Mia.  It’s good to be home.”</p>
<p>Grateful, I reached down and ran my fingers lightly through her locks.</p>
<p>And then a thought struck me.  Indeed, Mia’s hair was fine and fair, flowing like glossy strands of gossamer—so much so that I suddenly saw myself boorish to touch such a delicate thing without reservation.</p>
<p>Of course, I was yet committed to reacquainting Mia to the gentle touch.  But a woman’s own tresses were to her a treasure most cherished.  And so to lay a hand upon Mia’s own so freely was perhaps reckless of me.</p>
<p>Whelmed by the epiphany, I found myself frozen yet again as a silent lull stretched on between us.</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Mia’s gaze was pointed up, firmly fixed upon mine.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Master…?”</p>
<p>“Ah—sorry, Mia.  Your hair, it seemed like silk.  In a good way, I mean, soft as it is and all,” I stammered.  “And er… its black strands shine well.  Beautiful, really.”</p>
<p>My words, rushed though they were, echoed my honest sentiments.  Truly, her sable hair was as silken satin, though I certainly should’ve been more artful in articulating aloud my measure of it.  To be frank, the failure might’ve made me seem vain, if not vulgar.</p>
<p>“&#8230;thank you…”</p>
<p>And yet, Mia was gentle enough to offer those very words in return.</p>
<p>What an oaf I was.  A trusty laughingstock of the fates, to be sure.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>“Dear Commandant!  A matter!”</p>
<p>“What’s it now, Ebbe?  Not come to pitch your proposal again, I hope?”</p>
<p>Balasthea Stronghold.  There I was in the command chamber, my gaze dug deep in some organisational charts, till its upheaval by Ebbe’s arrival.</p>
<p>Of course, this wasn’t the first of such unannounced intrusions.  Ebbe had been bent of late on a plan to deploy the fort’s forces into Nafílim lands.  A counteroffensive, to be exact, one he saw promising much profit, now that Balasthea’s fortunes were quite favourable, and what with our men presently able to repel the Nafílim aggression to little trouble.</p>
<p>And he wasn’t alone in his bloodlust.  Many others in the fort echoed Ebbe’s call for belligerence, seeing the sound state of affairs.  That’s not to say their sentiments were fresh.  No, Balasthea’s plight prior to my arrival, dreadful and deathly as it was, yet burned bitterly in the men’s minds, and they meant more than ever to pounce vindictively upon this newly arisen opportunity.</p>
<p>“How now, Commandant!  Pray unclog thine ears an’ lend ’em to unclouded reason!” Ebbe resumed his theatrics.  “The enemy wanes an’ wavers in this while, thus we must strike!  Come!  While the iron glows hot, ey!”</p>
<p>Our foe was waning indeed.  But that’s not to say victory was at hand.</p>
<p>“Cool those veins along with that iron of yours, Ebbe.  Need I remind you—again—that this here is a fort, and its defence is our sole charge?” I stated firmly.  “Balasthea is our bedrock.  What good does it do any of us to abandon its walls for some foolhardy foray?”</p>
<p>It was the margrave’s men, the Fiefguard, who swung the sword of Ström, whilst we of the fort shouldered the shield.  This must be emphasised, for apparently it wasn’t in Ebbe’s blunted pate.  To merrily sortie our defensive ranks and leave empty the ramparts of Balasthea—purely on account of a newly held advantage—is naught but a filth-stain of a strategy.</p>
<p>“Well then, I ‘spose I’ll fare off on this ‘foolhardy foray’ on my own—with my unit in tow, that is,” Ebbe shrugged.  “Worry not, Commandant!  Our swords’ve sang in Nafílim air no few times ’fore, they have.”</p>
<p>I shook my head.  “You but drave those swords into the backs of our foes as they fled, Ebbe.  Yet here, you are intent upon invasion—another manoeuvre entirely, one that demands numbers you well-lack.”</p>
<p>“What’s this now, ey?  You think Balasthea some cradle, Commandant?  An’ we its babes, scarce able to eke out a vict’ry without its coddling walls?  I think not!”</p>
<p>“The only babe I see here is <i>you,</i> Ebbe.  One drunk from his rare bottle of victory, babbling and bumbling after the bait of ‘invasion’.  Time and again have Londosius’ finer forces fumbled on that familiar path—to their own regret.  Rather than wending down where their feet and flesh once fell, you might do yourself some good to grow up.  Trade that bib of yours for a burgonet, why don’t you?  And tighten its straps all the more tautly should you ever find the lulling taste of victory sweet upon your viper-tongue.”</p>
<p><i>“Tch…!”</i>  Anger twitched on his face.  “Fine then, Commandant.  I’ll bow t’your spirit, I will.  But tell me this first, yea?  Our plans for the headwaters—why strike it down, hm?”</p>
<p>The headwaters—a springpool spied by our scouts not more than a few days past.  Located in the woodlands behind enemy lines, we surmised it to be a source of fresh water to the Nafílim, and the more ruthless amongst our ranks proposed we poison it.  Corroborating tracks were found in its vicinity, ones that indicated its use by Nafílim civilians.  Thus to befoul the waters would beget their widespread waste and woe.</p>
<p>Such was what was reported to me.  But in the end, I rejected acting upon it.</p>
<p>“A gainly gambit, it is, fraught with only a little danger to us forces,” Ebbe continued.  “Why, we once had it done t’great effect, ‘fore your arrival!  So I ask again: why?”</p>
<p>I remained silent, staring back at Ebbe only to see in his own eyes a speck of savagery.</p>
<p>“No…  That look on your face.  I spies a tongue well-ready t’spew the same nonsense as ‘fore.  Some spit ‘bout staying us hands from the civilians.  Say it ain’t so, Commandant!”</p>
<p>My brows furrowed.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Befouling this fair land is our last resort.  We owe much to the earth, to its winds and waters.  We cannot be so wanton in laying waste to it, not least when the war-momentum already wheels in our favour.”</p>
<p>A smile.  “Ah, then you <i>do</i> admit, ey!  That it be very much a plan worthy o’ action, given a pretext with a price t’match!”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I do.”</p>
<p>“Hmph.  Well an’ good.  Well an’ good, indeed…” he said fadingly, “&#8230;for now.”</p>
<p>“Ebbe,” I called to him as he turned his back.  “I’ll say it till it is seared into that pate of yours.  Do <i>not</i> act upon any plan that has met my rejection.  Next time you get out of line, and there won’t be a ‘next time’ for you.”</p>
<p>A nail driven in, just in case.</p>
<p>Once before was this man insubordinate, taking his lackeys along to pursue the Nafílim in their retreat—after my express orders not to do so.  Only by the margrave’s intervention was he let off the hook.  But never again.</p>
<p>“‘Course, Commandant.  I am a soldier, after all.  Obeyer o’ orders, subject t’the rule o’ law,” Ebbe leered and sneered.  “But orders have their limits.  Rules have their exceptions.  Oh, let’s say—were my dear Commandant too ill-abled and dim-wit’d t’do his office, for example.”</p>
<p>“And what does that make you, Ebbe?  So able-bodied and bright-witted a babe you are, to think only of tearfully tattling to your margrave,” I shot back.  “Only after I assumed command were the fort’s fortunes turned ‘round.  Your dear lord knows well of this—and of my irreplaceability.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Graceful words from an ungraced.  But you’re no less a babe than I, Commandant.  Be not too tipsy off your own bottle o’ milky merit, hm?  Lest you find the mornin’ after a mite much for you t’stomach.”</p>
<p>“Ebbe.  Your plan to poison the headwaters is dead.  You shall <i>not</i> act upon it.  Do I make myself clear?”</p>
<p>“Oh, you very well do, Commandant,” he smirked, making for the door.  “You very well do.”</p>
<p>A deed to be done, must be.</p>
<p>Even when harried by hesitation.  Even when left with lingering questions.</p>
<p>As long as I believe it must be done, so shall it be done.</p>
<p>This, I found myself pondering as I glared at Ebbe’s parting presence.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>Now that the breaches brought upon Balasthea had been stilled, and the fort spared of its fate withal, I’d been finding myself freed from my daily duties rather regularly.  Well, “regularly” being the word here, for on this particular day, work had piled up, and my hours at the fort alongside it.  Thus was I home not a minute sooner than midnight.</p>
<p>At the porch, I unlocked the door and began my way in, but took not more than a step further before my body jolted, startled.  For there, standing in the sombre gloom, illumined only by the light of my lantern, was Mia.</p>
<p>“&#8230;welcome home…” came her quiet greeting.</p>
<p>“Mia,” I returned, somewhat breathless.  To her I went, kneeling down and setting the light upon the floor.  “I’m glad to be home.  Gladder still had you not waited for me, not on nights like this.  But then again, I’ve not told you so before, have I?  I’m sorry.”</p>
<p>Despite my words, Mia did all but stand there.  The lantern-lit amber of her eyes were locked in their look upon me, amidst the orange murk of our otherwise unlit home.</p>
<p>“My work takes up my time however it pleases, for better or worse,” I went on.  “I’ve been home rather early as of late, I know, but there’ll be days of the contrary, just like today.  So don’t you worry about waiting for me.  Whenever you’re done with your duties, you can retire to your room as you like.  Can you do that for me, Mia?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes…”</p>
<p>With that, I picked myself up and set alight some oil lamps, filling the house with their humble glow.</p>
<p>‘Retire to your room as you like.’</p>
<p>‘Light the lamps as you need.’</p>
<p>That it had slipped my mind to tell her such meant that Mia knew to do little else but stand here in the dark, waiting, waiting, waiting for me through the many silent whiles.</p>
<p>‘Think for yourself and do as you will.’  This, I certainly could not say.  Were it so simple, but alas.  Mia was a child whose every privilege was plundered; not without consent could she even dare to do aught.</p>
<p>We have within all of us freedoms most fundamental—that goes for Mia, as well.  Especially Mia, more like.  Of this, she must be enlightened.  But till that time comes, I must do my part and guide her with all due diligence.</p>
<p>How witless of me indeed to not realise this sooner.</p>
<p>“The lamps—I’ll show you how to light them later,” I said, coming back to Mia’s side.  “And as for supper, well… I’d like nothing more than to sup with you whenever possible.  But should my work keep me late, I’m afraid you’ll have to sup alone.  Bear with me, all right Mia?  I’ll be sure to leave bread and bacon out for you to eat as you wish.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;all right…” she answered softly.</p>
<p>“Very good.  Right, time for supper then.  Wait a while for me, will you Mia?  I’ll cook something up right quick.”</p>
<p>With the matter settled, I immediately went about preparing our meals.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Having set out the victuals, I joined Mia at the dining table.  The freshly cooked food was deliciously asteam, yet my dinner-mate’s eyes were ever empty of emotion as they stared on at her dish.</p>
<p>Seeing her so still—surely she must’ve been just as quiet whilst awaiting my return through those many slow hours.  Diligently so.  And where else but in the dusked and unlit loneliness of our home?</p>
<p>The mere thought of it was enough to awaken an ache upon my heart.</p>
<p>And anger withal—anger, to be given to none else but myself.</p>
<p>I wished only to take good care of Mia, yet it seemed my fate to fail whenever and wherever it mattered most.  Indeed, it well-explained why I was exiled in the first place: always was I one to falter in forming and nurturing meaningful bonds with those around me.  No farmhand can reap aught from unsown fields, after all.</p>
<p>How I resented myself so at this moment, to find that I’d not grown one bit over these past few months.</p>
<p>…Nay.</p>
<p>I mustn’t be given to regret.  No good ever comes from so corrosive an emotion.</p>
<p>Reflecting upon one’s past faults for the betterment of future deeds is a habit most fruitful, to be sure.  But to regret?  Naught but a seed for foul fruits, regret.</p>
<p>A coward—that was I.</p>
<p>A coward from the start, uncouth, hapless in giving help to a girl in dire need of it.  For that reason, Mia’s heart remained yet unreached.</p>
<p>A carpenter, then.</p>
<p>This coward shall be as a carpenter, free from his shackles of shame.  A bridge he’ll build, to cross the chasm at last and reach the girl so abandoned.</p>
<p>The same girl who now sat across from me at this very table.</p>
<p>“Sorry, Mia.  Wasn’t as quick as I’d promised,” I spoke at last.  “Right then, let’s eat.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;many thanks… for this meal…” she said, and I followed suit.</p>
<p>“Many thanks for this meal.”</p>
<p>Spoon in hand, I helped myself to the late-night meal of lentils—a warm and hearty stew bedight with the lovely legume.</p>
<p>Ah, yes.  Legumes, and peas and beans besides, simple yet superb.  Veritable bricks and mortar for the growing body, a meal sure to be of great avail to Mia’s health.  Why, I’d even heard that the cuisine of her own kin makes a staple of lentils and the like.</p>
<p>Bolstered by the thought, I looked to Mia, ready to vouch for the virtues of our meal.  Only, I found her frozen in her seat.  Her dish of lentils remained undisturbed as she stared down upon it, unblinking.</p>
<p>“&#8230;le… lentils…” she murmured, almost in a whisper.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Mia?”</p>
<p>The moment remained unmoved.</p>
<p>But then came a change, for there upon Mia’s cheeks was the glimmer of tears…</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;uu… hic… auu…!”</i></p>
<p>…and the sound of her soft sob.</p>
<p>Emotion—the first I’ve seen of it from Mia.</p>
<p>What ailed her, I wonder?</p>
<p>What words might I comfort her with?</p>
<p>Such worthless thoughts never crossed my mind.  No.  A fool I was, but by this point, wise enough to not be halted by hesitation.</p>
<p>At once, I left my seat and rushed to Mia’s side.  There, I took her into my arms and clasped her close to my bosom.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;u… uu… auu…”</i></p>
<p>Into my chest, her heartwrenching hiccups and cries echoed.  On and on, Mia wistfully wept, and after a while, she wound her own arms about me.  In her little hands was a pained strength as they clenched dearly at my shirt.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;uu… uaaah!  aaaah…!”</i></p>
<p>What was once a whimpering weep now grew into a wail wild with tears.</p>
<p>Met with it, I summoned forth some strength of my own, to hold her closer still.  Now, there was no thought, no fear that flickered in my mind that I might shatter her frail person from so strong an embrace.</p>
<p>No.  I gave all of myself to Mia this one hug, whole in its hale, filled with but a simple wish.  A wish that she would know in this moment that I was here for her.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;uu… hic… auu…”</i></p>
<p>On and on, Mia snivelled and sobbed.</p>
<p>On and on, I held her close upon my bosom.  A vigil for her lament, kept till her vaulting voice settled to a soft stir and her tears were tamed at last.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Deeper now was the benighted hour.</p>
<p>Supper was had.  I now found myself in my own room, sat at my own desk, skimming through some reports.  The day’s work at the fort had overflowed; some of it, I had to bring home with me.</p>
<p>Yet try as I might, the words and letters were dammed at the very papers they were scrawled upon, for not even a trickle of their meanings made their way into my mind.  Instead, in my heart was the memory of moments before, of Mia’s pitiable weeping.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;Haa.”</i></p>
<p>I sighed, dropping the papers on the desk.</p>
<p>My eyes looked up to the ceiling, seeing there a vision of Mia once more.</p>
<p>My ears yet rang from her sobbing.</p>
<p>My heart was yet sore from the weight of her suffering.</p>

<p><i>…knock.</i></p>
<p><i>…knock.</i></p>

<p>A rap upon my door, soft of sound, one I might’ve missed were my wits any more occupied.  To the door I went, and upon opening it, found Mia standing there in her sleepwear.</p>
<p>“Mia,” I said.  “What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;um…” she wavered, looking up at me.  “&#8230;I… um… s… sorry…”</p>
<p>Hesitant words.  At their end, Mia seemed to give up, and so turned to leave.</p>
<p>“Mia,” I called.  She halted.</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Couldn’t sleep, I take it?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I…”</p>
<p>“Not many can, I’d think.  Not after recalling so sad a memory.  Not while alone, afraid of being swallowed up by something unseen.  Am I wrong?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>To me, she turned.  A silent surprise was writ on her face.</p>
<p>Having met foes mightier still than myself, whether deep in their bristling garrisons or the bloodied bowels of their lair—I knew something of fear.  More so than most, at that.</p>
<p>“It’s all right, Mia.  Come.”</p>
<p>Words said welcomely, only, they inspired all but stillness in Mia.  Thus was I the one to venture forth.  Not asudden, but with softness in my steps, as if threading through a narrow bridge, precarious in its span between us.</p>
<p>At its end were we met again.  Her amber regard gazed up to me.  As if peering for some purchase.  As if to ask, ‘can I depend upon you?’</p>
<p>Not by words would I answer.  Instead, I took her into my arms and picked her right up.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;ah…”</i></p>
<p>Into my room we went, and then with all gentleness, I let her alight upon my bed.</p>
<p>“&#8230;oh…”</p>
<p>With no further care for the reports left on the desk, I snuffed out the lamp and laid myself beside Mia.  The bed was humble and for but one, furnished along with the rest of this little residence.  And so to share it with me, burly as I am, was surely a snug affair for Mia, but it would have to do.</p>
<p>Only, there was but a single pillow upon this bed.  I certainly thought to let Mia have it all to herself, but then sensed she might have pitied me had I done so.  Indeed I surmised as much, what with her emotions now making their steady return at last.</p>
<p>And so with a little lift of her head, I let my arm serve as her pillow.</p>
<p>“&#8230;um…?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Mia.  There’s just one pillow here.  My arm’ll have to do.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;oh… all right…”</p>
<p>Timidly then, Mia leant herself upon me, and there I felt the gentle weight of her head.</p>
<p>“&#8230;stars…”</p>
<p>“Hm?  Ah.  That’s right.  Nice view, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>In the ceiling just above us was the skylight.  Through it was revealed the veil of night, unclouded and richly starred.  A sight, brilliant to behold.  From the cramped comfort of the bed, we quietly admired it together.  Some celestial peculiarity then seemed to pique her sight, the wonder of which moved her lips.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Stöhr…”</p>
<p>“Good eye, Mia.  Stöhr’s <i>Sternbild,</i> right?” I echoed, finding what she found.  A sequence of stars, forming something of an image—“Sternbild,” as the Nafílim called it, and the one in question depicted a famed figure of many fables.  “Stöhr—belle-maiden of bygone days.  She’s well-recounted in Nafílim tales, isn’t she?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;oh…?”</p>
<p>I then sensed Mia’s gaze turning to me.  What emotion filled them, I did not find, but fair enough to say, it was likely naught else but awe.</p>
<p>“Nafílim lore.  I’ve read a thing or two on it in my spare time.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;books… you like books… you said…”</p>
<p>“Remembered, I see.  That’s right.  I’m a bit of a bookworm.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Stöhr… what’s she called here…?”</p>
<p>“Nothing at all, in fact.  The Men of this land aren’t given to naming stars, you see.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;oh…”</p>
<p>“‘Oh’ indeed.  It’s a shame, really.  Gazing far up… giving your thoughts and dreams to the night sky…  A wonderful thing, I’d say.  And poetic, too, to name stars after things most dear.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I like Stöhr…”</p>

<p>At last.  This would be the first favourite I’ve known of Mia’s.  To yearn to know more of another, and then to hear of it from her own lips…</p>
<p>What an honour.</p>
<p>What a blessing.</p>
<p>“Fairest Stöhr.  Belle-Maiden of the Hinternorth,” I recounted aloud.  “And a saviour, at that—one who led thousands of Nafílim folk on an exodus to lands more fertile.  A myth to move the heart.  And no less moving are her tales with Knight Aurél.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes… I admire her… very much…” said Mia, with a tinge of mirth in her timbre.</p>
<p>Taken with it, I pointed up.  “Look.  The Sternbild next to Stöhr’s.  There’s Gweil&#8217;ǫrr, my own favourite.  The great <i>gamalldrekinn…</i>  They say his fiery breath turns even steel to ash.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;dragons… boys like them… a lot…”</p>
<p>“We do, at that.  Dragons… welcome figures in our fancies, they are.”</p>
<p>In uttering those words, I myself turned to look upon the side of Mia’s mien.  There, I found the familiar amber of her eyes, once utterly empty of aught, but now beautifully brilliant, for reflected in them was the sea of stars soaring above.</p>
<p>A precious moment.  A precious time.  One filled further on with wondrous conversation between us, till at last the lids of Mia’s eyes hung heavily, and the songs of sleep began to breeze from her lips.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>A new dawn.</p>
<p>Silver skies, scented with rain.  In them, the clouds roiled in a fine curtain, and wrung from themselves a gentle drizzle.  A wet pitter-patter was all about, like an airy hum, intersected by the swish-swash of a sword swung many a time over.</p>
<p>One last slash.  The steel stopped.  The rain resumed.</p>
<p>With the morning training done, I stepped inside from the backyard, body and blade both steeped in rain, which I summarily wiped down.  Indeed, even in exile, I yet swung the sword without cease.</p>
<p>Now dry and with a change of clothes, I began preparing breakfast, one a bit more elaborate than usual.  A day-off this was, after all.  I had time and more to spare.</p>
<p>It was in the course of my cookery that I noticed Mia standing beside me.  Her eyes seemed tightly taken with my hands as I prepared the ingredients.</p>
<p>“Mia,” I said.  “Want to lend a hand?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes…”</p>
<p>To her were handed a grater and a peeled potato.</p>
<p>“We’re having pancakes for breakfast.  Of the potato sort, that is—’tattie fish’, they’re called ‘round these parts.  Not a fish in them, though.  But to make them, we first need some grated potatoes.  Think you’re up to the task?”</p>
<p>Nodding, Mia took tool and tuber both, and steadily went to work.  Albeit the kitchen counter was rather high compared to Mia’s humble height.  She stood against it, as though to peek over it.  An uncomfortable position, to be sure, and one that convinced me of the need for a stepping stool henceforth.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;huff… huff…”</i></p>
<p>With innocent industry did Mia work away, giving her all into grating a potato larger than the hand that held it, so much so that I couldn’t help but watch over the precarious pluck of her efforts, earnest though they may have been.</p>
<p>“Careful now,” I reminded her.  “Wouldn’t want grated fingers in with the potatoes.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes… Master…”</p>
<p>Content, I went to work myself, mincing an onion before setting out some flour and a frypan.  The rustling rain washed away the quietude in the kitchen as Mia and I immersed ourselves in making breakfast together.  Before long, her toils bore fruit: the potatoes were all perfectly grated.</p>
<p>“A job well-done, Mia,” I remarked.  “Right.  Now, salt.  There’s some on the shelf there.  Can you fetch it for me, Mia?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;oh… I’ll try…”</p>
<p>Elbow grease was what’s needed for the preparation, and finesse and a fine eye besides, for next came the cooking.  The batter was done: a mixture of minced onions, grated potatoes, and flour, seasoned with salt.  Into a hot frypan it went, the ensuing sizzle delicious to our ears.  And apparently to Mia’s eyes as well, mesmerised in their stare upon the enticing sight.</p>
<p>“Heat—that’s the key,” I broached over the singing batter.  “Fry the tattie fish well and they’ll turn right crispy.  If not, you’re in for a sad meal.  That’s why a bit of boldness goes a long way: cook them like you mean to burn them.  Well, almost, anyway.”</p>
<p>In the midst of my explanation was Mia, looking intently up to me, her head nodding and bobbing to my babbling words.  Right.  For next time, a lesson, then, on how to handle the hearthfire, to complement her new stepping stool.</p>
<p>“And they’re done.  Can you set out the plates for me, Mia?”</p>
<p>With the “fish” fried to perfection, we then moved to the dining table.  After plating up the potato pancakes, we sat ourselves down across from one another.  But we wouldn’t dig in yet: into our mugs, I poured a hearty helping of hot milk.</p>
<p>To be sure, the bovine beverage is not a common accompaniment upon the dining tables of Londosius.  Instead, many amongst the disparate provinces find milk more fitting in a potion than a potation.  The Buckmann barony, however, bucked the trend, for its folk indulge in the drink with fair frequency.  For my part, I, too, partook of it no less fervently, as it was pleasing indeed to my palate.</p>
<p>Perhaps this burly body of mine owed much to the miracles of milk.  The assumption seemed sound enough: the nutrients therein well-nurtured the growing body, after all.  And as luck would have it, here in Ström was milk a common commodity.  Often did I offer coin for it in my visits to the market; more so of late, even, for I made certain Mia had her own good share of it on the daily.</p>
<p>“Many thanks for this meal.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;many thanks… for this meal…”</p>
<p>With our usual graces given, we dug into breakfast at last.  Into my mouth went a morsel.</p>
<p>Ah.  Delicious.</p>
<p>The crispy crust: toothsome and aromatic.  The centre: roundly rich and creamy.  No doubt the perfect breakfast for a grey day such as this.</p>
<p>“&#8230;yummy…”</p>
<p>A compliment from cheeks chock full of potatoes.</p>
<p>“Think so, too?” I echoed.  “They’re like velvet on the inside.  And it’s all thanks to you, Mia.  A fine job at grating the potatoes, you did.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;next time… I fry, too…”</p>
<p>“Ambitious now, are we?  Glad to hear it.”</p>
<p>Down her gaze went.  “&#8230;I’m sorry… for having you cook, Master…”</p>
<p>“It’s quite all right, Mia.  Cleaning and washing on the daily—you do plenty enough ‘round here already, I’d say.  It certainly doesn’t sit right with me to ask too much of you.  Besides, like aught else, cooking doesn’t come easy.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;cooking… I want to learn, too…”</p>
<p>“Then you’ve some lessons to look forward to,” I grinned, gladdened by her spirit.  “Ah, Mia.  Don’t forget your milk.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;oh…”</p>
<p>Thus went our breakfast, served and savoured to our greatest satisfaction.  Thereafter did the both of us go about our disparate duties: Mia with her foresaid chores, and myself with the work I brought home.</p>
<p>The hour-sand flowed by till nigh-noontide, when I found Mia coming into my room.</p>
<p>“Hm?  Oh, right.  My thanks, Mia,” I said, taking her offer of tea, the brewing of which she’d taken up just recently. “&#8230;Ah.  A fine cup, this is.”</p>
<p>And as I sipped away at the scarlet brew, my eyes wandered to the window, discovering the morrow’s rains to have receded.  Indeed, splashes of cerulean skies now peeked from between the parting clouds.</p>
<p>“Mia,” I started again, inspired by the sight.  “How about we go for a walk?”</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Across avenues and through the thoroughfares we walked.  Wet cobblestones snooped conspicuously above the pools and puddles of rainwater, like bales of turtles tarrying about a pond.  And as we stepped through them, there was roused in the air the perfume of rains now passed.</p>
<p>The soaked streets themselves were as a speckled mirror, reflecting the silver-blue mottle of the skies above.  Flanking the footpaths were the shops and stalls, their eaves and awnings collectively adrip with the drizzle’s dew, each drop a gem bedazzled by the silver sunbreak.</p>
<p>The beauty of boulevards, fresh from a rain’s farewell—if memory serves, there once lived a particular playwright who penned songs of high praises for idyllic scenes such as this.  An effort well-inspired, I’d say, for I shared in his admiration.</p>
<p>And amidst it all were Mia and I, just now nearing the town centre, where awaited the marketplace.</p>
<p>I should say, Mia was free to venture off outside as she pleased.  Of this I’d apprised her well before, though truth be told, it was not so simple a matter.  While she was lawfully a slave, she was yet a Nafíl, and the fates were ever fain to rain misfortune upon a soul of her kind, were she all alone in her wanderings through the warrens of Man.  And that’s to say nothing of Mia’s mind itself, fraught as it was with fear for the mere presence of my own kin.</p>
<p>For that reason, it’d been my earnest intention to take her along on such a stroll were the opportunity to ever arise.  And today, it finally did.</p>
<p>“Hmm,” I wondered aloud as we browsed through the grocers’ stalls.  “Next… we’ll get some sausages.  And a head of cabbage, too—good for a pickled side-dish, it is.”</p>
<p>After a trip to the butchers and the green-grocers, I found my purse a bit less burdened, but my hands all the more so.</p>
<p>“&#8230;can I carry, too…?”</p>
<p>“Ah, right.  Here you are, then.  My thanks.”</p>
<p>Not this colossus of a cabbage would Mia hold.  To her, a pack of dried apricots instead, sure to be a delight in meals to come.  As if knowing this, she held the pack with all preciousness, till there came a stillness in her stare, fixed as it was upon some stalls further ahead.</p>
<p>“First time seeing them, Mia?”</p>
<p>A nod.</p>
<p>If my readings ring true, then it’s certain that open-air markets such as this are also a convenience common in the Nafílim cultural sphere.  Though looking at Mia, it would seem none of theirs offer the sort we Men like to call “street food”.</p>
<p>A perfect chance, then.  There’s a first time for everything, as they say.</p>
<p>“Right.  Looks like lunch is in order, and I know just the menu for us.”</p>
<p>And off we went to the foodstalls, where greeted us sights and scents delicious enough on their own.  A moment later and a few coins lighter, we came away with lunch in tow: two skewers of pork, grilled and glazed with sauces both sweet and savoury.  Then, upon a nearby bench we sat ourselves, having set down our purchases.</p>
<p>“Here’s yours, Mia.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;thank you…”</p>
<p>After taking her share rather clumsily, we were then ready to eat.</p>
<p>“Many thanks for this meal.”</p>
<p>“…many thanks for this meal…”</p>
<p>Shoulder-to-shoulder, we began nibbling away at our lunch.  A tasty one, at that.  For however divorced Arbel was from the coasts of the continent, it more than made up with its illustrious livestock industry.  Hence could one scarce go wrong in selecting any of this province’s myriad samples of pork.  Why, Mia herself seemed quite taken with it, for her share was soon all but polished off.</p>
<p>Albeit a bit too quickly, perhaps.  Was it a meal too meagre?  One more visit to the foodstalls it was, then.  It wouldn’t do for naught but meat to compose her meal, anyhow.</p>
<p>My mind turned to menus more filling—perhaps a sausage roll on a stick would do the trick.  Pondering such, I scanned about for any foodstall that might offer the treat, till my eyes spotted Mia staring off to the near distance.</p>
<p>For there in her view was a family.</p>
<p>One of four, filled with warmth and felicity.  Mother and daughter, hands clasped.  The son, seated upon his father’s shoulders.  Within the waxing sunshine, their smiles, their laughter, beaming, brimming.</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>Down did Mia’s gaze turn.  A heavy gloom then veiled her visage.  Even from the side of her face was it painfully apparent.  And so did my hand alight upon her head.</p>
<p>“You all right there?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes…”</p>
<p>A reply most quiet.</p>
<p>“You know, Mia.  Sorrow’s not something to be suffered alone,” I broached.  “Share it with a friend.  You might find it a lighter burden than before.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Sharing—that’s what friends do.  Whether it be food or fun.  Happiness or hardship.  Or laughter and lament,” I went on.  “That’s why, I’d be very glad if you would share with me your burden, Mia.”</p>
<p>Her languishing look, once fallen, then wended its way up to me.  Slowly, but without surety.</p>
<p>“&#8230;you’re… my friend…?”</p>
<p>“Aye.  That I am.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;even though… you’re my Master…?”</p>
<p>“‘Master’?  Not really, I’d say.  By the covenant, sure.  But of the bond between us, well… I’d like to think we’re warmer than that.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“How about it, Mia?  I’ll lend both ears to aught you have to say, if you have the heart for it,” I said as softly as I could.  “Your story.  Might I hear of it?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>For a mired moment, Mia looked fixedly at me.  Her eyes had not the empty and soulless quality of before.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>In them was emotion.</p>
<p>Quivering emotion, steeped in sorrow.</p>
<p>I thought to free her from that deep dolour, a paralysis upon her heart as it was.  Perhaps then, with her bosom unburdened, might her true and erstwhile nature find the spirit to sprout once more.</p>
<p>Before long, after a while of looking upon each other, Mia at last parted her lips with all quietness.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Master… I…”</p>
<p>What followed was indeed her story.  Her journey.  Her struggle.  Told most timorously, her words waxing and waning with the hurt in her heart.</p>
<p>Then was it known to me that Mia was once one of six.</p>
<p>Six souls, bound by both blood and love—a family.</p>
<p>Her father was a lumberjack, carving out a living for his dear family.  But with the times as war-like and uncertain as they were, so, too, was her father a serving soldier.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Papa…  Papa was the strongest…” Mia recalled, “&#8230;no one else in the village… used a big axe like him… and he… he often went… into battle with it…”</p>
<p>“A battle-axe?  Impressive.  No common man can wield such a thing,” I remarked.</p>
<p>“&#8230;but… but one day… Papa didn’t come home…”</p>
<p>What came instead were the rank and file of Londosius, there to ravage and rifle her village.</p>
<p>Mia continued on with her tale, her voice at times wavering and broken.  Indeed, a voice of a most gentle and endearing quality, made to relate details most jarring and dismal.</p>
<p>Of how her brother bore himself against the soldiers assailing their home, only to be cut to his death.</p>
<p>Of how her father had returned as a war-fallen corpse, only to have his head presented as proof of his death.</p>
<p>Of how her mother was bound up and left to scream for her children, only to be struck to her death.</p>
<p>Of her two sisters.  One, left to an unseen fate.  The other, captured along with Mia herself, only to quail to her death.</p>
<p>The tragedies upon her family, all told with appalling particularity.  Only, Mia said very little of herself, and even less of what she had suffered in captivity.  I knew then, more than ever, that Mia was indeed a child who cherished her family more so than she did herself.</p>
<p>But it need not be said: this child, too, was victim to viciousness and cruelty, more so than the mind can conceive.  That much, I was certain of.</p>
<p>“Mia…  You’ve been through much.  Truly.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes…”</p>
<p>There we sat, the weight of the past pressing upon our spirits.  After sorting in silence all that she had said, I spoke once more.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Mia.  What’s done is done.  None amongst us can ever hope to change that.  All the hurt, all the suffering…  The pain of the past never goes away,” I said heavily.  “But you know, Mia.  The future is different.  It can be changed—and by my hands, I will see it done.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Your days yet to come—they’ll all be free of sorrow.  And I’ll make sure of it.  I promise.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Master…”</p>
<p>In my bosom I then embraced her.  The ensuing while, long and wordless, was filled with her weeping.  What those tears portended, I could not know.  But for her, some comfort, at least, to shed them in the company of another.</p>
<p>“Tell me one more thing, if you can, Mia?” I asked upon seeing her sobs subsided.  “The day your village was attacked—when was it?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;seventh…” she answered against my chest.  “&#8230;the seventh… of <i>Visdrekmánuðr…”</i></p>
<p>“&#8230;That long ago, was it?”</p>
<p>Of late, a certain possibility prowled about my mind.  Only, something unspoken in my heart stayed my lips from speaking of it.</p>
<p>“Visdrekmánuðr”: a month of the Nafílim calendar.  That would be four moons ago from this moment.</p>
<p>That meant only one thing.</p>
<p>Mia was taken—nay, <i>abducted,</i> on whose watch but my own.</p>
<p>Rolf Buckmann, Acting Commandant of Balasthea Stronghold, allowed this to happen.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>That night.</p>
<p>Once again was Mia asleep upon my bed.</p>
<p>Not long ago was the supper we shared of lentil stew.  I remembered all too well of how she broke down in tears so asudden then.  Only thereafter was it known to me that her father well-favoured the foresaid legume, and that a meal of it was to be had with the whole family upon his return.</p>
<p>A tragedy, then, that such would never be.  Forever was he lost to war, and with him, the happiness of a family supping together with their dear father.</p>
<p>This was what Mia recalled.  The sorrows, unearthed.  The tears, roused.</p>
<p>In the bedtime that followed, Mia had thought to visit my room, too shaken as she was by the awoken weight of the trauma.  It was then that I shared my bed with her, and together we stared at the stars till our sound slumber.  From then on, every so often would Mia visit me in like fashion, when the memories were a reminder too vivid, when the solitude of the night proved too affrighting for her heart to handle.</p>
<p>Earlier today, in the course of our outing did Mia at last relate to me her plight and past.  The gentle persuasion to do so was founded in my simple desire to lighten the burden of her sorrows, if even by a little.  But just as before, to reminisce upon misery of such might was a tax too dear upon Mia’s mind.  So it was that again, she now slept by my side.</p>
<p>Serenely so.</p>
<p>Her slumbering breaths were unabated.  It would seem her dreams had found some peaceful purchase.</p>
<p>But the same could not be said of my heart.</p>
<p>For the tragedies that befell upon her—not least her captivity and indenturement—all transpired only after I had assumed my post as acting commandant of Balasthea.</p>
<p>Of course, that possibility was hardly a thought unvisited in my mind.  But to think earnestly upon it only now…  Yes.  In the end, I may have been merely afraid to confront so cold a truth.</p>
<p>By her words, Mia’s village was violated four moons ago.</p>
<p><i>Visdrekmánuðr.</i></p>
<p>Within the first days of that fateful month.  A time I recalled too well.  One that found me yet unaccustomed to my new life and duties here.  One that found me in friction with the margrave.  Indeed, the words and ideals we exchanged were as a clash upon a battlefield.</p>
<p>Yet neither of us yielded in the end.  The margrave went ahead and sent his men through the gates of Balasthea, their hearts steeled with the singular aim of pillaging all that they would find in the Nafílim domain.  Whether it be trinkets and treasures, or innocent souls to be sold as slaves for a pretty coin, nothing was to be spared from their eager grasps.</p>
<p>Oh, did I sue for the staying of those hands.  But my reasonings were alien in these lands as they were to the margrave’s mind.  So it was that we could not find accord with one another.  So it was that I could do naught but look on, powerless to stop the rape and ransacking that ensued thereafter.</p>
<p><i>An ease upon my heart, were Mia’s abduction an affair well-transpired before my charge.</i></p>
<p>Needless to say, I wouldn’t dare fancy such folly.</p>
<p>Even then, there lingered in me some indelible lament or misgiving that left me breathless.  Like a stone of solicitude set squarely upon my bosom, to press upon my lungs till their beleaguerment.</p>
<p>Why was I so wrung?  Well…</p>
<p>There was but one reason.</p>
<p>Not more than a few days after my argument with the margrave did I find his Fiefguardsmen returning from their greedy excursion.</p>
<p>Across the fort they coursed, their carts and carriages packed with plunder.</p>
<p>Across my presence they passed, homebound to the bowels of Arbel.</p>
<p>And within one such waggon was surely Mia, her sister withal.</p>
<p>Fresh from the massacre of their family.  Their hearts, fracted.  Their fates, forever shadowed.</p>
<p>The both of them passed right…</p>
<p><i>…right by me.</i></p>
<p>What now welled up within my heart, I knew not the nature of.  Whether it be self-resentment.  Or whether it be sympathy for those blameless victims.  But what I did know of was the shallow extent of my grasp.  The true worth of a man utterly powerless.  Now, more so than ever.</p>
<p>The Nafílim are a kind to be killed, if not imprisoned and enslaved.  Nevermind whether they bear arms or amity.</p>
<p>Such is the creed of Man, common throughout all his realms.</p>
<p>This, I knew.</p>
<p>That the waggons passing under my watch were possibly bedecked with prisoners…</p>
<p>…this, too, I knew.</p>
<p>Yet it was not till a living example was presented before me that the weight of that truth was first and full-impressed upon my conscience.  An example by no other name than “Mia”.  Indeed, not till our chance encounter did I ever realise what my actions exacted from my victims.  Of what plights my battles precipitated beyond their boundaries.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;no one else in the village… used a big axe like him…<br />
and he often went… went to battle with it…’</i></p>
<p>Of her war-dead father, Mia spoke as such.</p>
<p>Words, passing familiar.</p>
<p>The day before the Fiefguard’s raid.  Sternly did I turn down Ebbe’s wantonness for pursuing our routed Nafílim foes.  Yet in spite of this, he sallied out with his men and did just that.</p>
<p>Karl.</p>
<p>The greenest youth of Ebbe’s unit.  Verily was he inebriated amongst his like-sodden mates, celebrating the fruits of that selfsame pursuit within one of Arbel’s pubs.  His rambunctious ramblings rang clear to me, even now.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Git this…!  They ran…!<br />
…Wit’ them tails tuck’d under them bollocks like the curs they are…!<br />
…Then I came t’cut ‘em all down, I did…!’</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Got one o’ ‘em good, I tell ye…!<br />
…Biggest o’ ‘em bastards thought t’stay b’hind an’ let ‘is beefin’ brothers run off…!<br />
…Nice fellow wit’ a giant axe, ‘e was…!<br />
…Then I gave ‘im a good scratchin’ on ‘is back fer the noble deed, I did…!<br />
…Wit’ the keen side o’ me sword, tha’ is…!’</i></p>
<p>In cold blood did Karl cut down Mia’s father.</p>
<p>The dots certainly lined up.</p>
<p>I was commandant to these men.  Yet command them, I could not.  Thus did they give in to their grim bloodlust.  Thus did they kill Mia’s father.</p>
<p>Men.</p>
<p>Nafílim.</p>
<p>War was what bound these two together.</p>
<p>And so long as that fell fetter was uncut, so, too, would continue the cruelties.  The losses.  The tragedies.</p>
<p>Man and his kin were also culled in grievous numbers.  That, none can doubt.  And for that very reason does he take up sword and magick, to dam the tides of turmoil.  To him, the sword is keen not just for the killing.  With a swing of it can he protect those dearest to him.  With a strike from it can he defend his beloved homeland.</p>
<p>Such a man, bound to battle as he is, finds himself obligated to his country, and only his country.  To engender generosity towards his foe, to be derelict in his duties to his lord and land, amounts to naught but treason.  What he shall protect must ever and always be none other than his dear neighbour.</p>
<p>One does not err, to think so.</p>
<p>One is not deceived, to believe so.</p>
<p>And yet…</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>To Mia’s slumbering face, I looked.</p>
<p>The face of a child, innocent, faultless in this bloody affair.</p>
<p>What…</p>
<p>What must I…?</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>The following day.</p>
<p>Work resumed.  Thus was I back at the fort, sat within my chamber, nose deep in the records of four months prior.  Included were copies of the Fiefguard’s operational reports, shared by its commander.  Begrudgingly so, that is, but with my insistence that Balasthea’s defence would only benefit were I privy to all of Ström’s military activities, he could but comply.</p>
<p>The Fiefguard’s raid.</p>
<p>Their warpath had wended through the northwestern span of the woodlands yonder, past which laid a Nafílim village.  There did the men massacre any Nafíl ill-suited for enslavement; the rest were captured and carted away.</p>
<p>Treasures, coins, and commodities—these, too, were plundered.  The village itself, structures and all, were then deemed non-essential, and thus left no more destroyed than they already were.</p>
<p>At present, the village stood as a mere memory of itself, a den without its denizens.</p>
<p>With the reports read, I began piecing together all that I’d learnt with what Mia had related to me.</p>
<p>Not more than half a week before the fateful raid, her father had set out with his fellow Nafílim on a campaign to breach Balasthea’s walls.  A short-lived endeavour, for at its end awaited defeat, and in their retreat, the Nafílim assailants were pursued by Ebbe’s unit.  It was then that Mia’s father was felled.</p>
<p>The Fiefguard’s foray commenced the day after.</p>
<p>But in the waning light of the afternoon, a few hours before the Fiefguardsmen’s arrival, Mia’s mother left their home.  Not long after did her eldest sister follow, to check upon the orphanage where she oft gave a helping hand.</p>
<p>As evening came, so, too, did the Fiefguard.  Soldiers set upon Mia’s home, and her brother, dire in his deed to protect both it and his sisters, was cut down.  With no less than three men did he measure swords.</p>
<p>…A brave lad.  Would he were yet alive.  I certainly would like to meet him.</p>
<p>Indefensible, Mia and her elder sister were dragged out and taken to the village square.  There were the befouled remains of her father presented, and her mother later killed.</p>
<p>After that ordeal came another: the two girls were brought to Arbel.  To wit, a concentration camp therein, where the elder sister ailed till her last breath.</p>
<p>I dug my face into my hands.</p>
<p>Truly, a tragedy.  And such strength there was in little Mia.  To survive it all.  To retell it.</p>
<p>And it was thanks to her strength that there lingered one untended truth.</p>
<p>The eldest sister.</p>
<p>Not yet was her ill end established.</p>
<p>The Fiefguard’s findings recount no more Nafílim left in that land.  A right mind would reason that the orphanage, too, was attacked, and Mia’s eldest sister along with it.  Indeed, to re-tread this bloodied path would surely do naught but invite new nightmares to Mia’s haunted heart.</p>
<p>Yet, at the end of this unravelled thread may be hope, however faint.  And so long as there was, I thought it a worthy endeavour to seek it out and know its nature.</p>
<p>And espy whether it portended some semblance of solace.</p>
<p>Or despair.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>“&#8230;A conundrum, this.”</p>
<p>I pondered, homebound.</p>
<p>Not without visiting that eviscerated village could I, or anyone, know the fate of Mia’s remaining sister.</p>
<p>Indeed, four full moons have wheeled by since the coming of the raid.  Odds are, naught would be found.  Naught would be known.</p>
<p>But suppose I did find someone.  Not by my faculties would I be able to tell Mia’s sister from that of a mere stranger.  And that’s to say nothing of leaving Mia alone for however many days the trip would take.</p>
<p>Mia is key in this.  I must take her along.</p>
<p>Yet the way is not without its dangers; such woods are wont to host in their shadows any manner of beasts or behemót.  And to begin with, I am a kin of Man.  To wander unguarded into Nafílim lands is tantamount to suicide.</p>
<p>It bears no mention here: those territories are hostile now as they ever were before.</p>
<p>What’s more, I have my position to consider: as acting commandant of Balasthea, I am beholden to my men just as much as I am to Mia.</p>
<p>Am I a fool, then?  One sodden with the idea of deserting his office, all to protect a pitiful little girl?  An ungraced, chivalrous not by occupation, but by delusion?  A white knight—syndromically so?</p>
<p>What foul jest.</p>
<p>Steeped in such thoughts, I found myself arriving at my porch.  With the door opened, Mia came forth to greet me.</p>
<p>“&#8230;welcome home…”</p>
<p>“Glad to be home, Mia.”</p>
<p>To her, I looked.  The very subject of my worries—what did she herself think of all this?  No optimism was to be found in her words when she recounted to me what had befallen upon her family.  None, even for her missing sister.</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>It was by that same tragedy that such pessimism was conceived.  Mia was made to surrender all hope she had for the world.  Of late, her emotions were reawakening bit by bit, sure enough, but her heart remained fracted.  Not yet had it found an anchor.  Not yet was it ready to believe in aught.</p>
<p>Thus had she given up on the very idea of stepping foot once more upon her homeland.  There&#8217;s no escaping this realm of Man, she likely thought.  Not anymore.  So it was that to Mia, to ponder upon the simple possibility that her sister might yet draw breath was naught but a seed of fatigue for a heart already fatigued through and through.</p>
<p>But in that same heart.</p>
<p>At its very core.  At its very bottom.</p>
<p>Was therein any hope that it still nurtured?  For a dear sister so unaccounted for?  Did it yet have the strength to set forth into the unknown?  And make known the fate of her last family member?  Knowledge that can only be found in her homeland, the hearth of tragedy itself?</p>
<p>What must be done?</p>
<p>By my estimation, the chances that her sister still lived were exceedingly low.  But “exceedingly low” was not “nought”.  Though, truth be told, my conjectures, my considerations—all were based on this fragile fancy.  One ready to shatter unto shards set upon our hearts, were we to find not what we hoped for.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;Haah…”</i></p>
<p>A heavy sigh from my languished lungs.  My mind did all but ail as of late, ever since hearing Mia’s story.</p>
<p>Rolf Buckmann.</p>
<p>A man as much a giant as he is a want-wit, ever and always wavering when it counted most.</p>
<p>And true to his nature, not on this night, like so many other nights, would he find his resolve.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>The dawn of another morrow.</p>
<p>The beginning of another work day.</p>
<p>With a check of my boots, I started off on my commute to the fort.</p>
<p>“&#8230;be safe…”</p>
<p>“I will, Mia.  I’ll be home at the earliest.”</p>
<p>Mia, of late, has been given to venturing beyond our doorstep just to see me off.  There she stood upon our porch, looking quietly on as I stepped towards the road.  What prompted such courtesy, I could not say for certain, but I’d like to think it was a sign of our warming bond.</p>
<p>…Was the course of my thought, till at that moment, a one-horse waggon happened to wheel down the road.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;ah…”</i></p>
<p>Mia’s meek voice, heard as I watched the waggon pass by.  Her eyes were turned to a different matter, for in their view was a flower.</p>
<p>A lily-of-the-valley—</p>
<p>—crushed into the ground.</p>
<p>The dainty bell-flora were given to growing in great beds with their brethren.  Thus was it passing peculiar for a specimen to sprout upon an unceremonious wayside—not amongst its kin, but all by itself.</p>
<p>An ill-starred solitude, then.  To grow upon a path that would one day be driven over by a waggon, and in the wheels’ unwitting wending, be laid low.  Flattened—a smear of white and green upon the fresh furrow.</p>
<p>“&#8230;little flower…”</p>
<p>There was sorrow upon Mia’s mien.  A deep sorrow for the death of a flower.  Though she herself was victim to tragedies more grim and graver again, she had yet the heart to pity a flower.</p>
<p>To it, she went.  And then upon it, her caressing fingers.  Gently then, she began to stretch up its stem, that it might stand once more.</p>

<p>Only, it could not.</p>
<p>The bell-lily was forever broken.</p>
<p>“&#8230;poor… little white flower…”</p>
<p>The Nafílim.</p>
<p>The cunning curs.</p>
<p>The nemeses of Man.</p>
<p>An evil to be extinguished.</p>

<p>Who was it?</p>
<p>That first aired such curses?</p>
<p>A thrall of the Deiva?  Some sainted servant of Yoná?</p>

<p>I should like to meet him.  And end his wicked wiles.</p>

<p>For I’ve made a promise.</p>
<p>A promise to Mia.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;But you know, Mia…  The future is different…<br />
…It can be changed…<br />
…and by my hands, I will see it done…</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>&#8230;Your days yet to come…<br />
…they’ll all be free of sorrow…<br />
…And I’ll make sure of it…</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>…I promise…’</i></p>

<p>Am I ungiven to honouring my promises?</p>
<p>Of course not.</p>
<p>I keep my promises.</p>
<p>Down at Mia’s side I knelt, and put upon her shoulder a hand unwavering.</p>
<p>“Mia.  We must talk.”</p>
