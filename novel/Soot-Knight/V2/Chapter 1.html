<h2 style="text-align:center;">Ⅰ</h2>

<p>It was done.</p>
<p>The 5th Chivalric Order saw fit to expel me from its halls.</p>
<p>A wingless fledgling to be flung from the nest—only, not immediately so.</p>
<p>No, the Orders are each a military organisation, composing the arms of the vast royal army.  Not even the process of purging one of its own could escape the burden of bureaucracy.  And though I’d lost affiliation with the Order, let alone my meagre lot as a long-serving swain, I was yet a soldier of Londosius.</p>
<p>And where else would a soldier be sent but a battlefield?</p>
<p>In our lands, it is custom for a fallen knight to be driven off to the frontiers, where the fires of the frontline burn fiercest.  A knight I was not, of course, but it betrays neither reason nor reverie to think that the same fate awaited me.</p>
<p>Life in a faraway fringeland…</p>
<p>But which, exactly?</p>
<p>Even now, the top brass were deliberating upon it.  A whole ten days it would take, during which time, I was to be put under house arrest.</p>
<p>A rather toothless sentencing, to be frank.  I had not a house, much less a room of my own to be arrested within.  And so I spent my days dallying in the library.</p>
<p>Despite being warned to venture not a step outside the headquarters building itself, I routinely left its confines for my usual morning and evening training.  Not even this sad situation could deter me from the daily rigour.</p>
<p>That was the pattern, really.  Perhaps it was in the comfort of knowing that I’d be gone for good that the other officers were generous—or indifferent, more like—of my blatant rule-breaking.  Luckily, not a soul thought to question my actions the entire time.  Yes.  Lucky indeed.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Lucky?  I’m an exile, and wrongfully so, no less.  What am I, if not shrivelled up and dried of all luck?”</p>
<p>Such words I would put to the wind as the uneventful days dragged on by.  On the tenth of that span, I was told at last of my destination.</p>
<p>Balasthea Stronghold—in the far march of Ström the fort stood, and it was quite the distinguished one, at that.  Infamous for the extreme rate of fatality amongst its soldiery, Balasthea guarded a hotly contested territory, one rightly labelled as being amongst the most murderous killing fields in the entire realm.</p>
<p>Balasthea itself was manned by the Fiefguard of Margrave Ström, who managed the fort via funds and support from Central.  No vestige of the Orders were to be found on his land; all that I’ve grown accustomed to over the years would likely stand in stark contrast to the folkways of that frontier.  The very thought of it was enough to fray my nerves.</p>
<p>And if I’m honest, the last ten days were a strain upon my heart.  A shadow was cast upon it, darker again than I could ever have imagined—a dusk born from having to part from Emilie’s side.</p>
<p>I harbour no regrets in making that fateful decision.  But pain does what it does, and wounds are wounds in the end.</p>
<p>I’ve known Emilie ever since my mind could know aught, from the day the light of awareness first dawned upon me.  She was the one woman to whom I promised a life of love and happiness.</p>
<p>So many years…</p>
<p>…and now to ponder upon forgetting them all.</p>
<p>The heart is not so simple a thing, I’m afraid, to be able to sever asudden so dear a bond.</p>
<p>But the past forever dies, the present is forever here, and the future forever awaits.  Unbending truths for the kin of Man, and so I must forge ahead.</p>
<p>My destination is decided.  I can ill-afford to wallow in my woes much longer.  Death is where my way wends; it would not do to meet him without my head held high.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>The official day of my exile.</p>
<p>Unspotted and infinitely cerulean the morrow-skies were, as if to rain blessings upon my departure.  Were that truly so, then I suspect whoever wields the weather must be quite the dim-witted deity.  After all, what good comes from exalting an exile as he sets out upon so perilous a path?</p>
<p>There I stood at the main portcullis, where five years past I passed through with Emilie as we started our new lives here at the 5th.  Never did I think that I would leave it under such sullen circumstance.</p>
<p>The life of a man is truly uncertain, if nothing else.</p>
<p>Gracious were the fates indeed to have garnished my lot with such an assortment of surprises.  I should thank them.  Though the gesture might feign too brave a face, I feel.</p>
<p>“Word has been sent to Balasthea Stronghold,” spoke one of two leaders standing before me.  “Hand them the papers when you arrive.”</p>
<p>“Keep that nose of yours on the grindstone this time, yea?  And try not to get yourself kicked out again,” the other droned.  In fact, I’d say the both of them seemed rather bothered, to be left with the unenviable chore of officiating my disposal.  “Hah.  Whom am I kidding?  Wouldn’t put it past an ungraced to get the boot twice.”</p>
<p>With those words, the leaders then went about their business, hasteful in getting me out of their sight as soon as possible.  Of course, no horse would be furnished to me.  I was to travel to town by foot, and there make use of stagecoaches for the rest of the way.</p>
<p>Not that I was troubled much by it.  My sword, a smattering of sustenance, and a trusty waterskin I’d been using for the longest while now—beyond these, I carried little.</p>
<p>The air thudded.  Hoof-falls clopped close.  I looked, finding a formation of mounted knights cantering in.  They were all of them leaders, and foremost amongst them: Emilie.  This was the first time I’d laid eyes on her in the ten days since the hearing.</p>
<p>“Madame!” greeted one of the prior leaders.  “Come to send off the ungraced for good, I presume?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I suppose I have,” she answered.  There, from high up on her steed, did she look down upon me.</p>
<p>Our eyes met.</p>
<p>A heavy while, kept wordless throughout, till I turned my back.</p>
<p>“Be well.”</p>
<p>A simple goodbye from my lips, one unrequited from Emilie’s own.  Her silence was sustained as I stepped through and out of the portcullis.</p>
<p>And thus was executed my exile from the 5th Chivalric Order.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Reaching Ström was in and of itself a journey.  But of course it had to be.  It was a march of Londosius, for which its brand of “border province” was hardly for show.  Given the kingdom’s sheer breadth, no less than seven days passed between my departure from the 5th’s grounds to my arrival at the frontier.</p>
<p>Through Londosius had I gone, faring by one stagecoach after the other.  At times, it would stop at a stage station for a change of horses.  Other times, I would transfer to another service entirely, and resume on my horse-drawn way.  Countlessly did this occur, and by the seventh day of that long chain, I at last crossed into the hilly, evergreen stretches of Ström.</p>
<p>Disembarking from my final stop, I then spent another full day afoot, trekking alone through the treacherous spans till I found the fort looming before me.</p>
<p>Balasthea Stronghold.</p>
<p>The redoubted redoubt.  A veritable edifice facing the Nafílim lands squarely on.  Solid stonework composed its ramparts, while the fort proper was oaken in construction.  A rather drab and dreary place compared to the grandeur of Order architecture.  And intact it was not: Balasthea was riddled with scars, reminders of blistering, bygone battles.</p>
<p>Beyond it were the Nafílim territories, an expanse strewn with woodlands that blanketed the base of a cragged mountain.  The lay of this immediate land was such that no Nafílim host could venture an offensive without being funnelled through a single geographical point.</p>
<p>But the same could be said of Londosius’ own forces.  And so what did such men build upon that imperative point but Balasthea itself?</p>
<p>Not too far from the fort spanned the fiefburgh of Arbel, the urban administrative centre of the Ström frontier.  And in that burgh-city stood the residence of the margrave himself.  To be sure, Arbel was well-defended in its own right, but if bereft of Balasthea’s shielding shadow, then it might as well be a sheep shuddering alone in a wolven wilderness.</p>
<p>No wonder, then, that the Nafílim were utterly fierce and focused in their offence, a seed of violence that sprouted Balasthea’s repute as a deathtrap battlefield some years past.</p>
<p>The margrave himself was not one to stay his hand in answering such aggression, as evidenced by occasional incursions of his own into the Nafílim lands.  But the men composing the margrave’s military were of a sort different than those stationed in Balasthea.</p>
<p>Make no mistake, the soldiery of Ström was all the margrave’s own: the Fiefguard.  Yet a distinction must be made between those stationed at Balasthea and those that the margrave directly commanded: the former were charged strictly with the defence of the fort, their very flesh made as shields to guard against its fall.</p>
<p>And that selfsame fort was to be my new place of employ.</p>
<p>“Hail!” I called to the guardsman at the gate.  “I am Rolf Buckmann, a transfer from the 5th Order.  The vice-commandant is wise to my arrival, I take it?”</p>
<p>“That he is,” he answered.  “This way, ser.”</p>
<p>The gates groaned open.  The guard then guided me through the fort grounds.  We soon entered the keep, and after winding through its corridors, emerged in a room where waited but one man.</p>
<p>“Ebbe’s the name.  Vice-Commandant o’ this here fort,” he introduced himself.  A bony man of about thirty years of age, this “Ebbe” was given to maintaining a constant, sarcastic furrow upon his brows.  “Quite the long way you’ve come, eh?”</p>
<p>“Rolf Buckmann,” came my own curt introduction.  “A long way indeed.”</p>
<p>“Fortunate we are t’have you, good Commandant.  Let us hope you’ve not come all this way for naught,” Ebbe returned, already bothered by my arrival.</p>
<p><i>“Acting</i> Commandant,” I corrected.</p>
<p>That’s right.  I was instead charged with a position of leadership, spared from the dread and drudgery of soldiering.</p>
<p>The men of the fort were each in the employ of the margrave; none, and nothing, had anything tangible to do with the Chivalric Orders themselves.  Yet by the laws of Londosius, Balasthea and all other forts like it are subordinate to the knightly institution.</p>
<p>Intimate is the link between Central and the Orders, for better or worse.  In contrast, the forces of a fort are fairly divorced from the kingdom’s grip, being composed of only common soldiers from the surrounding region.</p>
<p>But this land, by rights, belongs to the king himself, and the margrave is merely its steward.  All under the latter’s purview, then, are subject to the will of Central, and by extension, the Orders themselves, cruces of the royal military that they are.  This naturally includes the dictation of human resources and staffing—and the handling of my exile.</p>
<p>But that was not all that undergirded my charge here.  Balasthea’s actual commandant was beset by a chronic ailment, and so was put out to pasture for the time being.  It was there that Emilie herself saw an opportunity to make me acting commandant to this fort.</p>
<p>Her designs were undimmed: no doubt she thought I would die both immediately and unceremoniously were I made a regular grunt upon so lethal a battlefield.</p>
<p>The soldiers of this fort all hailed from the common citizenry.  Thus was it entirely reasonable to assign an aristocrat from the Order to fill the commandant’s seat.  That was a bill I snuggly fit: despite having never rose beyond swainhood, and having been denied inheritance of the Buckmann barony, I was yet a noble hailing from the Order.</p>
<p>Given how so many pieces of the puzzle fell into place, it was easy to see why Emilie was so impelled to place me in this post.  Though if I’m honest, to be exiled straight into a position of power was itself enough of a seed for a strange tale.</p>
<p>It was my hope that Emilie had not stepped on too many toes to get this affair approved.  Thankfully, this was to be the last.  Never again would she have to imperil her position.  Yet it was very likely that she’d accrued a hounding debt to Central in the process… all just for my sake.</p>
<p>It was clear as day, then, why Ebbe’s behaviour was so briared upon our meeting.  A second-in-command such as him is certainly whom one would expect to take over the duties of an absent commandant.  Yet here was I, an ennobled—and exiled—newcomer, suddenly snatching away the selfsame privilege.</p>
<p>The very sight of me must’ve stung him sore, I’m sure.</p>
<p>“And how fares the erstwhile commandant himself?” I asked.</p>
<p>“Oh, he fares.  The afterlife’s busy rolling out the red carpet for the poor master, you’d be glad t’know,” Ebbe answered dismissively, before turning a pair of sneering eyes to me.  “But here’s another Commandant right in this room, an’ he piques the whiskers o’ Ebbe, the curious cat—a question, sir!”</p>
<p>My eyes narrowed.  “What tickles you?”</p>
<p>“Your expulsion.  What else?” Ebbe smiled as he continued.  “A comely kick it was what sent your arse all the way t’this neck o’ the woods.  What <i>tickled</i> the knee, hmm?”</p>
<p>“An itch you should know well of.”</p>
<p>“The one upon the horse’s hind!  Ahah!”  The vice-commandant’s grating giggles filled the room.  “Y’hide quite the hoof-mark on your haunches, don’t you, my aching Commandant!  Not a cutpurse nor a turncoat you are!  No no!  A stablehand too ‘handy’ in his handling o’ a horse, I’d wager!  An’ now the steed’s a runaway, whilst you’re the stun&#8217;d castaway!  <i>Hoh!</i>  No more slapstick a shtick there’s ever been!”</p>
<p>“Slapstick indeed.”</p>
<p>My flat humouring all but goaded a goatly grin from Ebbe’s bony face.  If his unceasing chuckles were anything to go by, I’d say he was having a grand time at my expense.</p>
<p>“How now, good knight!  Cheer up!” he squawked.  “Or should I say, ‘good swain’?”</p>
<p>“Then you’ve said right.”</p>
<p>“Good <i>swain!</i>  Such a short time with the Order it must’ve been!” Ebbe bellowed with arms wide, before tucking them in akimbo.  “No more than half a year, was it?”</p>
<p>“Five.”</p>
<p>“Mm?  What’s that?  Five?  <i>Five</i> years, y’say?”</p>
<p>“You’ve read my records.  Why play this farce?”</p>
<p>“I’d misplaced my reading glasses, y’see!” he smiled, more toothy now than ever with delight.  The man was certainly revealing himself to be quite the articulated puppet to his own emotions.  “Come now, Commandant.  Do tell.  Five years, was it?  As a swain?  What kick&#8217;d off <i>that</i> career, eh?”</p>
<p>“You well-know why.”</p>
<p>“Be not so cold, Commandant!  Come.  Let us hear it.  Straight from the <i>horse’s mouth!”</i> he squealed with restrained laughter.  “I can’t scratch this itch myself, ey!  Your secret, sir!  Your <i>secret!</i>  How does a man simmer the swain-stew for five long winters?  Oh, do enlighten me!  I beg o&#8217; you!”</p>
<p>With the theatrics of a thespian, Ebbe shrunk and leant in, hands clasped together imploringly.  Yet his face remained ever ugly with its jeer.</p>
<p>“Play the japing jester all you want, Ebbe.  I care little,” I shot back.  “But even a jester has an office he ought to serve well, and I will have you serve yours—properly.”</p>
<p>From the vice-commandant’s throat came a roaring laugh, like a saw eating into a tree.</p>
<p><i>“‘Office’,</i> y’said!?  Ah hah!  I’d say you’re quite the clown yourself, Commandant!  A blind an’ bumbling bloke has but t’lift his finger t’be told he’s served his office better than you, my good man!”</p>
<p>With those words, the ghoul-like grunt’s guffaws echoed on and on.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>The fort baileys.</p>
<p>Drumming through the air were grunts and clanks, the stamping and sliding of heavy feet, the huffs and hisses of swung weapons.  For there was gathered the soldiery, busied in its exercises at my behest; before all else, I needed to measure the might of these men—or lack thereof.</p>
<p>“What think you, Commandant?” asked Ebbe, his face strained with a great grin.</p>
<p>“The men are meagerly armed, but they move well enough—each on his own, that is.  A flock of headless chickens coordinates better than they.”</p>
<p>“‘Coordinate’!  Hah!” Ebbe snorted.  “Eagle-eyed, are we, Commandant?  Tell me, how sweet ‘pon that beak o’ yours was it t’squawk such lordly words, hm?”</p>
<p>“This soldiery is oddly sorted, to start with,” I continued, unheeding of the vice-commandant’s vitriol.  “And the platoons… I see too great a difference in prowess between them each.”</p>
<p>Whoever organised these men had long abandoned any notion of balance.  Clearer than the summer sun was the intent to match the strong with the strong, and leave the weak to wallow on the wayside.  A warped piece of wood this was, one in need of some honest planing.  Left lop-sided as they were, the men would remain incapable of coordination, even if their lives depended on it.</p>
<p>“Do you, now?” Ebbe sighed.  “Sing t’me more o’ this lullaby, my dear balladeer.”</p>
<p>“You first, Ebbe—those men over there.  What are they?” I asked, flicking my chin off to the side.  There in the distance was gathered another group of men, a score and a half in number, each encased in argent armour.  Just by the look of them, I could tell they were the standouts of the soldiery: well-armed and well-trained.</p>
<p>“Why, they’re mine, o’ course.  Guardsmen o’ the Vice-Commandant, yours truly,” Ebbe explained, but seeing my unimpressed response, he blinked.  “Hmm?  Are they not mete with your measure, my man?”</p>
<p>There is no fault to be found in surrounding a commander with a group of select soldiers, highly-skilled and made separate from the rest of the pack.  The Orders’ Owlcranes attest to this.  No, the problem laid elsewhere.</p>
<p>“Not in numbers, they are.  Why so many?” I enquired keenly.</p>
<p>“Because many’s what I <i>require,”</i> Ebbe answered with pomp.  “What?  Your eagle-eyes failing to espy why, now are they?”</p>
<p>Well, let sleeping dogs lie, as they say.</p>
<p>Balasthea was a fort, defence being its primary charge.  Were a battle to break upon its walls, certainly these men under Ebbe could prove useful as reserves, sent to match swords with any overly ambitious aggressors.  Besides, leaving but thirty men at the rear would not necessarily amount to a tactical flaw of any substance.</p>
<p>It was readily apparent that Ebbe’s personal guards were a point of pride to the man; in exchange for turning a blind eye to them, I would have the vice-commandant himself consent to another matter.</p>
<p>“Fine, then.  They’re your men; I’ll not shuffle them about,” I relented.  “But of the others—all of them—they’ll be mine to reorganise as I see fit.”</p>
<p>“Yes, yes, almighty chessmaster.  Play with your pieces <i>however</i> you like.”</p>
<p>As I thought.</p>
<p>Ebbe is a man jealously protective only of that which is his own.  Aught else is trivial as rags to him.  Right then.  Changes for the good were on the horizon at last, with not a peep from Ebbe to bar their implementation.</p>
<p>“Good.  You’ll be briefed on the results once the re-sorting’s done with.”</p>
<p>“Oh, do <i>take</i> your time, Commandant,” Ebbe waved off disinterestedly.  A dim grin remained on his face, its corners propped up by contempt.</p>
<p>“Ebbe, I’ve said this once already: you’re free to mislike me as you like—<i>privately.</i>  You all well-risk life and limb to defend this fort, I know, and know very well.  That your commandant’s seat was unceremoniously re-suited for the Order’s designs is certainly something to scorn.  Howev—”</p>
<p>“Well now, kind hawk o’ a Commandant!  Is that an olive branch I spy in your talons?  Hm?  A fort is but a sprig sprouted far from the Order’s boughs, oh certainly.  T’be taken over by a noble—disgraced an’ rotted fruits, the lot o’ you—is not so rare a sight, yea?”</p>
<p>That simper of his wrinkled deeper as he continued.</p>
<p>“Yet Balasthea is an aegis essential t’Londosius’ defence.  But you?  What’re you but a broken, knightless blade, ill-pair’d with the pavise o’ Balasthea?  An’ you would have me <i>respect</i> you.  How precious.”</p>
<p>“Precious indeed, respect.  A man pays it to whomever he pleases, sure,” I conceded, before turning a glare to Ebbe.  “But I am your superior officer, and I will <i>not</i> brook insubordination.”</p>
<p>“Well!  Yoná be merciful—<i>oh!</i>  The squawk o’ this hawk!  How it affrights my meek soul!” the farceur squealed smilingly, shrinking back and clutching his shoulders to great theatricality.  “Yes, <i>yes,</i> Commandant.  Tuck ’way your talons!  I shall heed your <i>every</i> word.”</p>
<p>What a pain in the arse.</p>
<p>Further troubles would surely follow with this pierrot snapping at my heels at every turn.  But no greater good was ever achieved without much toil: Balasthea’s situation must be turned around, lest it remain a graveyard ever-piling up with the vainly deceased.</p>
<p>Reform.</p>
<p>That was what this fort needed, and what I resolved to bring about.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>One grey day led to the next.</p>
<p>Under the dull and misted morrowlight, the platoons were assembled in the fort outskirts.  The air of the early hour was broken by barks from whom but Ebbe’s men themselves as they paced here and there, proud in their silver armour.</p>
<p>“Wot’s it now, eh!?” screeched one of those elites.  “4th Platoon: late in settin’ out fer patrol!  5th Platoon… no’ yet done fettlin’ the bloody rampart!  Ye wankers, can’t even do a ‘andyman’s work, is it!?”</p>
<p>“S-sir, right ‘bout t’set off, we was,” bleated a platoonsman of the 4th.  “But y’see, we then got ‘anded orders asudden, t’patrol some other place, an’ er…”</p>
<p>“We ain’t got many ‘ands fer the job, sir,” a 5th platoonsman chimed in.  “We should like t’fix up the rampart right ‘an proper, only command’s not ‘eeded a word o’ us request fer more men, see.”</p>
<p>“Excuses!  All I ‘ear is wet excuses!  Whimperin’ windfuckers, the lot o’ ye!”</p>
<p>“A-a-apologies, s-sir!”</p>
<p>On and on, this went.  A pitiful repetition of lambastings from the high-ranks, answered with naught but sorries from the low.</p>
<p>“Ebbe,” I called, watching with not a wisp of warmth.  “What’s with this nonsense?”</p>
<p>“Morning assembly.  What, can’t tell, good Commandant?  Eh?  What’s it look like t’you?  Tea at dawn?” yawned Ebbe.  “We gather ‘em all up, y’see.  Drill into them all they did wrong yesterday.  That way, they know the proper thing t’do t’day <i>and</i> t’morrow.  A try’d an’ true tradition, if I do say so myself.”</p>
<p>A self-important summary.  It would seem he was the very culinarian who cooked up this sorry stew of an exercise.</p>
<p>“Tried, yes.  True?” I shook my head.  “No, Ebbe.  No more of this farce from here on out.”</p>
<p>The grin vanished.  <i>“&#8230;What?</i>  How’s it a farce, ey?”</p>
<p>“How’s it <i>not</i> a farce, is more the question.  You but line these men up and drown their ears with the queerest quibbles.  Why, I’d wager you do all this just to stroke your egos against your subordinates, to drill into them instead of who&#8217;s high and who’s a hound,” was my bitter assessment.  “Naught but a <i>tree</i> that ill-bears a single <i>fruit</i> is all this is.”</p>
<p>“Oi you!  Think t’make us <i>yer</i> hounds, is it!?” came a shriek, one from the veiny throat an Ebbe-elite.</p>
<p>From the look of him, he seemed the youngest of that guard: a trace of childishness yet lingered on that fuming face of his as he stamped his way closer.</p>
<p>“Thass quite the tongue fer an <i>Actin’</i> Commandant, yeh!” he went on wildly.  “An’ proper swollen!  Bit it bold on yer way down, did ye?  When they kick’d yer arse off the Order’s saddle!  Well, ye can clam it up f’good, ye’ll be glad t’know!  Fer Master Ebbe be the one runnin’ the show ‘round ‘ere!”</p>
<p>“Karl, my boy.  Show a bit o’ pity for the man, will you?” Ebbe soothed the youth with uncharacteristic calm.</p>
<p>“Pity?  Wot’s this ‘bout, Master Ebbe?” blinked this ‘Karl’.</p>
<p>“Us good Commandant here is ungraced.  A sad an’ sodden-wit’d lad who knows not left from right on the battlefield.”</p>
<p><i>“‘Ungraced’?</i>  Wot’s that then, eh?”</p>
<p>“Spurn’d o’ Yoná’s good graces, as it were.  The man has got nary an iota o’ odyl in ‘im, see.  A full slap t’the arse was all he got from Her, I reckon.”</p>
<p>A revelation that inspired a stunned silence from both Karl and the other elites.  But another moment, and they were all of them in stitches, laughing their lungs out.</p>
<p>“W-wo—hwaha!  Wot’s this!?  ‘Ow&#8217;s ‘e even alive, eh!?”</p>
<p>“Thass a proper bit o’ kiddin’ there, Ebbe!  An’ look—got sent t’this ‘ellhole o’ all places!  A sad lot fer this sad lad!”</p>
<p>Through the midst of that commotion cut the sound of an unsheathing sword.  Gripping it was Karl, who then trained its tip to me.</p>
<p>“‘Ow ‘bout it, Commandant?  Spare a lil’ spar for good ‘ol Karl?  I promise I’ll be easy, yea!” the foul youth smiled, his threat rousing a ruckus from the elites.</p>
<p>“Bwahah!  Ye teach ‘im a stinkin’ lesson, Karl!  Show ‘im wot a stellar schoolboy ye be!”</p>
<p>“Come on, Karl!  Stand down!  Ye makin’ the commandant cry!”</p>
<p>“Ahah!  Ahahah!”</p>
<p>The Ebbe-guards continued their guffaws, clutching their bosoms from the hilarity of it all.  My duty it was indeed to scold their nonsense, but it was painfully apparent that they had not a mind to heed their ungraced commandant.</p>
<p>What other duty was left to me, then, was but to produce results.  Decisively so.</p>
<p>“No more morning assemblies from this day forth,” I announced sharply.  “And the 5th Platoon’s short on hands—too short to shore up some stone walls.  That in itself calls for a thorough restructuring of every platoon.  I’ll see to it myself that it gets done over the next couple of days.  That is all.  Dismissed!”</p>
<p>With my motive made clear, I left the ever-laughing scene.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Less than a week later found me standing in the command chamber, eyes fixed upon some papers in hand.</p>
<p>“Ebbe.  This report—whoever penned it certainly wasn’t in a hurry.  Not in defining the gap between both projected and verified damages, that is.  Why’s that?”</p>
<p>“Why the hurry t’go nowhere?” shrugged Ebbe. “Knowing just the actualities well-suffices.  You split hairs, Commandant!”</p>
<p>“I split hairs that we might survive another day, <i>Vice-Commandant,”</i> I shot back, lifting not an eye off the report.  “You and your men.  I would have you all be more thorough from here onwards.”</p>
<p>A snorting scoff. <i> “‘Thorough?</i>  What’s this now?”</p>
<p>“Make certain that you write in your reports both projected <i>and</i> actual results,” I elaborated firmly.  “And while you’re at it, go and inform the platoons that henceforth they are to include in their reports the reasons for such disparities.”</p>
<p>Balasthea well-lived up to its name: a facet of Londosius’ vast frontlines such as this had its fair share of skirmishes over the last few days.  Par for the course, but what had changed was the number of fatalities, fewer now than before my arrival.</p>
<p>I pulled out all the stops: platoons were reorganised, chains of command were recomposed, posts were repositioned, shifts were rescheduled.  Much ado it was, but the results were unmistakable.  Balasthea saw its silver lining at last, and it was a vivid one, at that.</p>
<p>Only, Ebbe’s attitude towards me had not improved in the slightest, as our conversation sadly attested.</p>
<p>“Come now, Commandant!  We are warriors!  Men o’ battle!  Not miserly bookkeepers!” he whined.</p>
<p>“You might’ve made yourself a more whetted warrior had you learnt how to keep a book, Ebbe.  Your years of service yet find you dim to following orders—now&#8217;s a good time to learn, I’d say.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Hmph.  Fat talk for an ungraced—”</p>
<p>Ebbe’s snide remark drowned in the bellowing air.  I glanced up from the papers.  The warning horns were sounded—an attack was upon us.</p>
<p>I sprang up and went to the window, finding men scrambling about in the fortyards below.  Before long, a platoon captain burst into the room.</p>
<p>“Commandant!  We’ve enemies at the gate!  They strike from the east!”</p>
<p>“Their numbers?”</p>
<p>“Us surveyors be countin’ t’this moment, but the Nafílim number the same as yesterday’s, from the looks o’ it!”</p>
<p>“Can’t deploy the 1st… their wounded have yet to recover,” I thought aloud.  “Have the 2nd and 3rd Platoons defend the west gate!  The 6th goes to the east!”</p>
<p>Unwelcome words to Ebbe.</p>
<p>“Have you got wax stuff’d in those ears, Commandant?” he quipped, taken aback.  “The devils’ve come t’the <i>east</i> gate, the man said.  What good’s it do t’guard the west so thickly, eh?”</p>
<p>“We do ourselves much good to sniff out ruses wherever they rustle.  Yesterday’s attack—the Nafílim struck the east gate then, too.  A trick to train our noses there, that we might not catch their scent coming from the west today,” I reasoned.  “A bait-and-switch.  We best be on our toes.”</p>
<p>Yet again, Ebbe snorted in scorn at my words.  Paying no mind to his subsequent giggles, I turned to the soldier.</p>
<p>“Captain.  You have your orders.”</p>
<p>“Right away, sir!” he saluted, and quickly quit the room.</p>
<p>Gearing myself up, I followed him soon after.  It won’t do to idle by, safe and divorced from the struggle; I would dictate the battle right in the thick of its throes.</p>
<p>Balasthea Stronghold—the fatal fort and veritable mound of the war-dead.  No longer would it be so dreaded.  This, I swore.  But for now, I would see to it that starting on this day, not a single soul would be lost to the fighting.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>The clank and clamour of battle burgeoned.  But its crescendo now crested from a direction different from the outset: just as I’d thought, the Nafílim’s main forces flooded in from the west instead.  By my orders, we had our defensive ranks reinforced accordingly before the clash.  The preparations bore fruit: our men met the foe, unmoved by their ruse.</p>
<p>“Keep the ranks filled!” came my command to a captain.  “Maintain our numbers and we maintain the upper hand!”</p>
<p>“Aye aye, sir!”</p>
<p>A facet of my reforms saw the formation of a new platoon of sentries, their charge it was to observe the battle from the high safety of a watchtower.  There, they would glean any gap in the numbers of both our forces and the enemy’s own.  This precious information would then be reported and relayed down to each captain, who would then dictate his platoon to the demands of the battle.  A veritable heart, the pulsing arteries of which allowed our numbers to swiftly shift between different sections of the fort as needed.</p>
<p>Such would not have been possible without disciplined coordination.  To achieve it, open communication was fostered at the organisational level, after which the platoons themselves were revised and reassembled.  From then on were each subject to stringent drills and exercises, all meant to make keen their coordinative capabilities.</p>
<p>The results were unmistakable: no matter where the enemy fell upon us, our men were able to meet them head-on with ample numbers in tow.</p>
<p>The erstwhile lack of flexibility and swiftness had regrettably begat no small number of soldiers left to twiddle their thumbs in the thick of battle.  And who could blame them?  They were situated in the wrong places at the wrong times, after all, on account of a complacent command.</p>
<p>All that was changed.  Now, Balasthea’s men were as blades honed anew, with not the smallest span of their edges left untended.</p>
<p>The battles breaking upon our bulwarks began to lose their teeth as my reforms bore further fruits.  In the midst of this heartening trend stood I, judging today’s clash to soon be another success.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Three turns of the hourglass later.  Victory was ours.</p>
<p>“The foes’re fallin’ back!” a captain reported.  “Might we give chase, sir?”</p>
<p>I shook my head.  “Leave them.”</p>
<p>“‘Leave ‘em’!?  Fer wot now, ah!?” came Karl crashing in.  “Why, we ough’ t’cull ‘em curs ‘ere, ‘fore they come chompin’ at us arses ‘gain!”</p>
<p>“A butcher earns no coin cutting meat that flees fast from his knife, Karl.  Besides, we’ve more pressing issues on our hands,” I sternly returned, before looking to the others.  “Check for casualties!  Report to me your findings!”</p>
<p><i>“Tch!</i>  Yellow-liver’d chick’n, you!” lashed Karl’s tongue, after which both he and the rest of Ebbe’s men made themselves absent from the scene.  Keeping the side of my glance upon them, I hastened the efforts to count the casualties.</p>
<p>But there would be none on that day, a fact found out not long afterwards.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>An hour had sailed by since I hurried from the fort on horseback.  The end of the rush found me in the Arbel fiefburgh proper.  Night had set in; the pubs were full-lit and alive.</p>
<p>I pushed open the door of one such establishment, quickly finding in its rowdy innards the shrill of a certain youth.</p>
<p>“Git this!  They <i>ran!</i>  Wit’ ‘em tails tuck’d under ‘em bollocks like the curs they are!  Then I came t’cut ‘em all down, I did!”</p>
<p>Karl.</p>
<p>There the youth was, with a tankard of ale in hand, thrust high in the air.  Surrounding him were Ebbe and the elite guards, to all of whom he sang of his feats earlier in the day.</p>
<p>Feats from pursuing the Nafílim in their retreat.</p>
<p>“Got one o’ them good, I tells ye!” he tattled on.  “Biggest o’ them bastards thought t’stay b’hind an’ let ‘is beefin’ brothers run off!  Nice fellow wit’ a giant axe, ‘e were!  Then I gave ‘im a good scratchin’ on ‘is back fer the noble deed, I did!  …Wit’ the keen side o’ me sword, tha’ is!”</p>
<p>The air swelled thick with laughter.</p>
<p>“From the <i>back!”</i> an Ebbe-guard wheezed from the hilarity.  “Karl the Coward, cutter o’ hindquarters!  Git a cockscomb an’ a wattle on him an’ he’ll look the proper poultry!  Haha!”</p>
<p>“Yea, wag that tongue all ye want, brother!” Karl quipped.  “This be war, ey!  Fuss ‘bout the champs an’ chick’ns ‘mong us an’ ye’ll be on the butcher’s block soon ‘nough, ye will!””</p>
<p>“Oh—!  Then I’ll be hangin’ with the ham-hogs right soon, eh!?  A charmin’ cut o’ charcuterie, I’ll make!  Hwahah!”</p>
<p>“Big ol’ butcher’s shop’s all it is, innit!  War!  Ahahah!”</p>
<p>A soldier I’d enquired back at the fort was right on the money: Ebbe and his brutes were wont to patronise this pub straight after a battle.  There they all were, pissed out of their wits, bellies bulging with downed bitters.</p>
<p>I had not a mind to join them.  No, grilling these men was precisely why I came to this watering hole in the first place.  To their tumultuous table I went, and raised a matter with one of those seated.</p>
<p>“You’ve got something to spill, Ebbe?” I growled at the vice-commandant, who was sat quiet and content, soaking in Karl’s gloating.</p>
<p>“&#8230;None, Commandant.  Not from this empty cup o’ mine,” he deflected.</p>
<p>“‘Leave them,’ I said,” came my cutting reminder.  “Only you didn’t.”</p>
<p>A shrug.  “What I do with <i>my</i> men is up to <i>me,</i> Commandant.”</p>
<p>“And what <i>you</i> do is up to <i>me,</i> Vice-Commandant.  Not least when we’re in the midst of battle.  I promised only to keep your guardsmen out of my reforms.  Nothing else.”</p>
<p>My words seemed to sting Ebbe’s ears as he forced out a sore sigh.</p>
<p>“Commandant!  <i>Commandant!”</i> barked Karl from the side.  “Give us a break, will ye?  Right jigger’d we be from ‘avin t’cut an’ kill the devils, all whilst ye sit comfy on yer ungraced arse!”</p>
<p>“Insubordination—that’s what you’ve committed, Ebbe,” came a bark of my own, sparing Karl not a moment of my mind.  “Report to my chamber first thing on the morrow.”</p>
<p>Pressing the matter any further here was futile.  With my command firmly given, I turned from the men and made for the door, catching a click from Ebbe’s tongue.</p>
<p>“Oh, wot!  Come on, Commandant!  Where ye be ‘eadin’?  ‘Ave a gulp wit’ us, yea?  Why, I’ll even throw in a free lecture: ‘ow t’swing a sword all proper-like!”</p>
<p>Again, I ignored Karl’s drunken drolling as I parted from the buzzing pub.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>The next morning.</p>
<p>I stood within the commandant’s chamber, having received a particular guest from Arbel.</p>
<p>“Buckmann,” said he, a man none other than the lord of this land: the Margrave Aaron Ström himself.  “The very first of our meetings, yes?”</p>
<p>“And one overlate; my sincerest apologies, Your Excellency,” I bowed.  “My hands were tied in turning the fortunes of the fort; I hope your generosity sees me fit for forgiveness.”</p>
<p>“Fit or no, I care little.  Even <i>my</i> generosity can be tested in having to humour an ungraced.  I’m a busy man, you see,” he brushed off, with a smile bending that moustached mien of his.</p>
<p>He seemed not much more than an ennobled bourgeois: conventional to a fault, with not a speck of scrupled inspiration in his eyes.</p>
<p>“You find Ebbe&#8217;s actions to be lacking in ‘lawfulness’, I take it?” the margrave went on.  “He is quite the capable commander, I’ll have you know.  You’d do right to learn a thing or two from a man like him.”</p>
<p>To that, I had no words.  The margrave’s smile faded.</p>
<p>“Do not deign to discipline him for his deeds,” he warned.  “Have I made myself clear, Commandant?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Yes, my liege,” I yielded.  I was but an exile of the Order, a soldier bound to this borderland; disobedience would be not brooked by its lord before me.  “And you are come for other business, as well, I presume?”</p>
<p>“I am, indeed.  A send-off, if you will.”</p>
<p>To the window, he pointed.  The view from the commandant’s chamber encompassed the gate leading to Nafílim lands.  There, I found a conspicuous congregation, its constituents neatly lined up.</p>
<p>Two-hundred men and more they were, freshly deployed from the fiefburgh.</p>
<p>My eyes narrowed at the sight.  “They move to attack?  My liege, I’ve heard naught of this.”</p>
<p>Balasthea was but a bulwark, the shield of Ström and nothing more.  Thus it stands to reason that the force formed before me was not the fort’s own, but the margrave’s: the Fiefguard.</p>
<p>“I’ve given speed to the schedule,” the margrave remarked.  “The fort is well-defended of late, and the Nafílim seem content to lick their wounds and wallow in their cowardice.  Not least in thanks to yesterday’s pursuit by Ebbe and his men; ‘twas a fruitful routing they’ve accomplished.”</p>
<p>In the outside view, a peculiarity caught my eye.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency.  A matter, if I may?”</p>
<p>“Speak it.”</p>
<p>“The covered waggons,” I pointed out, gaze locked upon the vehicles below.  “Rather large, are they not?  Yet they bear nary a load upon their decks.  What is their purpose?”</p>
<p>“Even one as dim as you ought to know.”</p>
<p>I turned to the margrave.</p>
<p>“&#8230;To pillage, my liege?”</p>
<p>My words earned a turn of his own to me.  There was puzzlement plastered on his face, but it soon congealed into a look of pity.</p>
<p>“I see the grace of wits has also been denied to you, Buckmann,” he softly scoffed.  “Frightful indeed, to be abandoned by so warm a mother as Yoná.  Oh, mercy!”</p>
<p>“I fear I do not follow.”</p>
<p>“Buckmann… poor and pitiful Buckmann!  We do not <i>pillage</i> the Nafílim, no!  <i>Hoh!</i>  Your pate has parted too many a passūs from its tracks, my dear and derailed cart of a Commandant!”</p>
<p>The margrave’s words were far from uncoupled.  It was common sense itself, whether within Londosius, or in the mind of Man.</p>
<p>We are at war with the Nafílim.</p>
<p>To plunder their property or their person is not an act to be lambasted, but one to be lauded instead.  After all, our enemy’s extinction is this war’s very aim.  Mind not whether they be of the soldiery or the citizenry, an infantryman or an infant, a grim garrison or a humble home.  All is to be spoiled.  None are to be spared.</p>
<p>Of course, such would not be suffered between nations of men.  It would be labelled as a “crime” or an “injustice”, an affront to human dignity.  But the tone swiftly turns were the Nafílim the target, “baneful barbarians” as they are branded.  This is the collective conscience of Man, his unbending and unchallenged truth.</p>
<p>But it is one that I cannot, for the life of me, fathom nor affirm.</p>
<p>Why must we maraud the meek?</p>
<p>And that is to say nothing of the citizens we seize and send to who knows where.</p>
<p>This is our “justice”, a holy banner raised for our own convenience, its weave unstained by the spit of dissent.</p>
<p>Those covered waggons—empty they were now, but certain to brim with riches upon their return.</p>
<p>And included in those spoils?</p>
<p>Slaves.</p>
<p>Labourers to be damned to enduring indenturement.</p>
<p>This, too, is “just”, acts whose barbarism Man is blissfully blind to, for they bring to him boons of too much benefit.</p>
<p>But my eyes were unclouded, and they could not bear the sight.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency,” I said sternly.  “With all due respect, I find it meaningless to sully so hard-won a prize as peace.  Pillage, and we but vilify ourselves beyond all vindication.  Such vices ill-become the lordly name of Londosius—even should the victims be the Nafílim.”</p>
<p>The margrave’s face furrowed.  “‘Pillaging’ the Nafílim ill-becomes the term itself, Buckmann.  The subtlety escaped you, has it?”</p>
<p><i>“‘Virtue’</i> is what has escaped from all of this, my liege,” I returned.  “None is to be found in taking from those who cannot fight back.  Yet say the victims are of a different sort, a different blood, and you would not only praise the act, but partake in it yourself.  Surely the sophistry is not lost to you?”</p>
<p>“Buckmann!” barked the margrave.  “‘Tis the <i>Nafílim</i> we speak of here!  The nemesis of Man!  The kin and kindred of crawling beasts!  Our sworn foes from the days of fair St. Rakliammelech himself!”</p>
<p>Even in the face of much fury, I could not back down.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, pray give ear to these humble words: accustom ourselves to wanton rape and robbery, and we debauch our hearts in the act.  We are men of war; it is our lives we wager on the frontlines, not our morals.”</p>
<p>“Hmph!  Sophistry, indeed!  I see the sophist before me!” he seethed, stamping his foot and thrusting a finger to me.  “To rape and rob the devils is morality <i>itself!</i>  You would do well to remember that, you want-wit, you!”</p>
<p>“Victory can be ours without this villainy, my liege!  That much is certain!”</p>
<p>“Commandant!” frothed the lord’s lips.  “Their labours, their luxuries—we make them all our own, that their brethren—our foes—might flounder and we, flourish!  For every prize we procure, for every devil we indenture, another of our meek and misfortuned might be spared the pale hand of Death!  Sear these words into your ill-starred soul!  For I am long drained of all generosity to further discuss so evident a truth!”</p>
<p>“But, my liege!”</p>
<p>“Enough!!”</p>
<p>…How futile.</p>
<p>Reason cannot reach him.</p>
<p>I could scarce see myself being in the wrong here.  No matter how painfully I peered.  No matter how much I mulled.  Yet all that I aired were as the howls of a heretic, words long parted from Man’s wicked wisdom.</p>
<p>And that was why the margrave and I could not see eye-to-eye.  Realising it, I found myself silent, hands and teeth clenched hard.</p>
<p>Afterwards, the margrave made his return to Arbel, whilst the Fiefguard funnelled through the gates and marched into Nafílim lands.</p>
<p>I stood there in solitude.</p>
<p>Overpowered by powerlessness, I watched on as the covered waggons wheeled close behind.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>


<p>Silver sunlight blessed fair Redelberne, city of splendour and capital of Londosius.  Its impearled walls and promenades glinted with the seeming glow of royal authority itself.</p>
<p>The marquisate of Norden, home of the 5th Chivalric Order’s headquarters, neighboured this bastion of Man.  And so it was not at all strange that Redelberne found a rather regular visitor in the vaunted Lady Emilie Mernesse, Dame Mareschal to the knights of the 5th.</p>
<p>Only, such trips were not partaken for pleasure.  No, no, not at all.  Business called her, and it was a busy caller indeed.</p>
<p>Many a Londosian would love to lavish themselves with a visit to the marvelled and marbled city.  But the Lady was different.  Where she wished to go, where she yearned to be, were all found elsewhere.</p>
<p>Certainly, any soul aspiring to greatness would jump for joy, to so receive a summons from Central.  Not an opportunity to be left unsavoured, this.  Yet what Emilie aspired to was not fame and fortune, but her own humble share of happiness.  The girl that once smiled so brightly upon the bell-lily hill was now a lady, listless in her stroll through the unsought streets.</p>
<p>Indeed, she was tired.  Tired of the meetings with the ministers and magisters of Central.  Tired of fraternising with the cloistered courtiers of the royal palace.  Tired of the feints, the facades, the faux smiles.</p>
<p>But Emilie was a young woman set upon tackling the challenges of her office head-on.  Hers was a soul of sincerity, a magnet of much trust from all those around her.</p>
<p>A meteoric mareschal.</p>
<p>A hero for the new age.</p>
<p>Who <i>wouldn’t</i> want to forge a fellowship with the fair Lady?  Only a scant few, if any, to be sure.</p>
<p>In the enthralled droves were to be found not just adults, but children as well, such as the ones encircling her at this moment.  Their eyes sparkled with fascination as they beheld before them a dame of much distinction.  For her part, Emilie had grown accustomed to such baby-faced phenomena.</p>
<p>This particular occasion—one of many—was begot at the behest of the little ones themselves.  They had enough pull for it, children and grandchildren of high officials as they were.  A longing to witness the wondrous dexterity of the dame was their excuse.  An innocent one, if not frequent.</p>
<p>Strangely enough, the children were already afforded the luxury of their own instructors, each distinguished and outstanding in his tutelage.  Suffice it to say, the little ones were hardly in want of instruction in the ways of the sword.</p>
<p>Emilie was wise to this, of course, but also to her own shortcomings as a teacher.  Indeed, that same humility had driven her to turn down the very opportunity to meet the children.  But the storm of insistence was unceasing.  In the end, the young mareschal could only relent.  And though she saw the redundancy of the situation, she did not, at first, discern the true desires of the children themselves.</p>
<p>The blade of the Aureola was surely show-worthy, but the little ones were hardly here for a fencing lesson.  Why, they simply wished to meet her, for she was, in the springtide skies of their hearts, a star of much awe and admiration.</p>
<p>But in indulging them so, Emilie at last saw the idolatry in their eyes.  Their enthusiasm being born from a wish to behold her blade-dance was, in fact, merely a misunderstanding on her part.  The summertide skies of her own heart blushed upon the realisation.</p>
<p>Yet their excuse was aired anyway.  ‘A swing of your sword please, madame.’  And so Emilie obliged, a humouring to hide her embarrassment, perhaps.</p>
<p>Pillars of lightning pealed and flashed, painting in pure white the wide breadth of the training grounds.  A moment, and amazement buzzed through the young crowd.</p>
<p>Before long, a pair of adolescents approached the mareschal, eyes upturned and hearts curious.</p>
<p>“P-pardon us, madame,” enquired the boy of the two.  “Might you have a moment to spare?”</p>
<p>“The Roun of Orisons,” began the girl.  “Is it true what they say?  That you’ve been blessed with the Aureola from the rites?”</p>
<p>A slight pause.  A slight smile.  “&#8230;As true as can be, I suppose.”</p>
<p>The conversation continued, during which the pair revealed themselves to be but fourteen years of age.  The Roun of Orisons was to receive them in the following year, an upcoming occasion that surely inspired expectation and anxiety alike in their hearts.</p>
<p>“What was it all like?” the boy asked.  “I can scarce imagine the spectacle, let alone the nerves!”</p>
<p>“Hmm, I wonder myself,” Emilie looked off in the distance.  “‘Tis been a long while—too long, really.”</p>
<p>“The both of us, we mean to give it our all and more, that Yoná might be generous in Her grace,” the girl gushed.  “Enough that we might fight for our families, our fellows—for all the good people of this good kingdom!”</p>
<p>“Knighthood’s my aim,” the boy chimed in.  “Big and strong is what I’ll become, and I’ll do all it takes to be knighted!”</p>
<p>To that came Emilie’s mirth, gentle, fragile.  “&#8230;You most certainly will, love.”</p>
<p>“‘Cause if I can’t, well, worrywart here’ll get her tighties all in a tangle.”</p>
<p>“W-who’s a worrywart, now!”</p>
<p>How warm they were to one another.  Emilie couldn’t help but beam broadly.  Yet the tinge of sorrow therein all but escaped the youthful pair’s knowing.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>A brief lesson on the basics of bladework was given thereafter.  To be sure, Emilie was, by then, fully aware that this truly was not what the children wanted, but to end the meet-and-greet then and there with just a demonstration of her levinblade would’ve been poor form.</p>
<p>Fortunately, she wasn’t alone.  The Owlcranes accompanied her on that day, and they certainly proved helpful—Gerd and Raakel in particular.  Numerous were the practice sessions they hosted back at the 5th, and so to instruct wide-eyed children was, to them, not too towering a task.</p>
<p>Soon enough, the sun went to slumber.  In the evanescing evenlight, the mareschal and her Owlcranes parted from the training grounds, their ears yet tingling from the lively gratitude of the children.</p>
<p>Through the starlit streets of Redelberne they then strolled, until the warm conviviality of a pub beckoned their patronage.  There, they reflected on the day’s happenings over glasses of golden ale.</p>
<p>“I’m truly sorry for dragging you all to the capital today,” broached Emilie.  “A big bother, I know, but just the thought of having to handle it all alone was enough to fray my nerves.”</p>
<p>“No need to fret over it,” Gerd assured.  “We saw much and did even more.  It was time well-spent.”</p>
<p>“Yea, Gerd’s got the right o’ it,” Raakel added.  “Teachin’ ‘em bright-eyed bairns a thing or two’s quite the honour, if I’m honest.”</p>
<p>“My, Miss Raakel.  How unlike you to be so honourably honest.  What has softened that sauciness of yours, I wonder?”</p>
<p>“Eh, shut it, Sheila.”</p>
<p>Yet it was certain, just as Emilie’s self-reproach had revealed: this kind of outing hardly required the attendance of the entire Owlcrane Brigade.  The day’s function was founded more in politics and high society sweet-talking than aught else.  The Owlcranes were soldiers, after all, souls who earned their living laying their lives on the line.  And Emilie was very much the sort to blush with shame in dragging them so far from their place of employ.</p>
<p>But between the commander and her combatants, there was camaraderie, one fostered for years now—bosom buddies, they were.  Thus did the Owlcranes quickly answer Emilie’s call in her time of need, confident in knowing she would have done the same for them.</p>
<p>“And I owe you a special apology, Sheila,” Emilie continued.  “They insisted that I might as well bring the entire brigade if I was to bring anyone at all, you see.”</p>
<p>“There is naught to be sorry for,” the surgien softly giggled.  “But if another such occasion comes along, I should certainly like to savour a chance to teach more magick-minded youths.”</p>
<p>Smiles, all around the table, brightened further by the brimming bitters in their cups.  To them, a waiter came, bearing samples of exquisite cuisine.</p>
<p>“Now here’s the stuff!  Roasted venison, tender an’ juicy!” Raakel salivated.  “Can’t come home from the capital without me tummy full o’ this grub!”</p>
<p>“Good grace, Raakel,” Gerd shook his head.  “Came along just to stuff your cheeks with those deer chunks, did you?”</p>
<p>“Hah!  What ye been takin’ me fer, Gerd?  I ain’t a saint, y’know!”</p>
<p>Loose lips japed and chuckled in concert.  An atmosphere drunk with jolly and joy.  As their merrymaking went on, so, too, did the late hour wax on, all within the benighted bosom of fair Redelberne.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>“&#8230;Phew…”</p>
<p>A warm breath, blown from flustered cheeks, aglow as they were from many a sip of ale.  The night breeze, cool and crisp, coursed against them to much welcome.</p>
<p>Emilie took in the pearl-dusk cityscape, having taken a moment from the pub to sober up.  It was quiet.  The streets were asleep.</p>
<p>To be sure, Redelberne’s thoroughfares and promenades were no less packed even in the dead of night.  But Emilie’s was a face too famous around those parts.  So it was that the considerate Owlcranes had chosen instead an establishment well off the beaten path, that they might while away the moonlit hours in relative peace and privacy.</p>
<p>It was but a hole-in-the-wall, this pub, humble and quaint, but it brimmed with both brightness of light and levity.  Even outside, Emilie’s ears could faintly make out the merrymaking.  She found the moment to be most romantic, in a way, to behold such liveliness from so tranquil a perch.</p>
<p><i>“Haa…”</i></p>
<p>How delightful, this night.</p>
<p>Yes.  Delightful, indeed.</p>
<p>To brush off a bothersome workday, and then with friends in tow, eat, drink, and mingle till the moon fancied a bit of slumber itself—it was nothing, if not delightful.</p>
<p>If not…</p>
<p><i>If only…</i></p>
<p>Emilie was quiet as she peered up into the everdistant sky.</p>
<p>A sky that arched on and on, well into the borderlands beyond.</p>
<p>She recalled then of the boy and girl she’d met earlier that day.  How excited they were, with but a year till their own reckoning at the Roun of Orisons.  They had asked her of her own experiences at the rites.  She did not recall, was the simple sum of her answer.</p>
<p>A little lie, that was.</p>
<p>Emilie remembered.  All too well.</p>
<p>Of how her heart swelled with anticipation.  Of how thoroughly she thought that from then on, there awaited only days of hope and happiness.  An era of innocent dreams for an innocent future.</p>
<p>Only, that future never came.</p>
<p>Leading up to the rites were bygone days blessed with bliss, each and every one.  Yet the Roun of Orisons was a door that forsook it all.  Emilie had crossed it, beguiled, and when it slammed shut, she found herself ever longing for all that was lost behind its lock.</p>
<p>And for that reason, the rites, to her, were not a welcome memory.</p>
<p>But they were a memory she well-remembered nonetheless.  A memory she could never forget.  Oh, if only she could.</p>
<p>“Emilie love.”</p>
<p>A voice rang through the thick marshes of her thoughts.  Emilie turned, finding Raakel coming close.  Upon her face, too, was a fluster from bingeing too many bitters.</p>
<p>“Raakel,” Emilie returned.  “Come to sober up a little, too, I take it?”</p>
<p>“Can’t help it,” the warrior grinned.  “That Sheila’s got a friggin’ well fer a stomach, whilst Gerd’s a fool fer tryin’ to keep up.  I call’d it quits fer a bit, see.”</p>
<p>A quiet laugh.  “&#8230;Of course.”</p>
<p>Silence suffused the nightscape.  Against such enormity, the dames were as two blades of grass swaying contently against the starlit breeze.  The air was delicious, and Raakel was happy to partake.  After a lungful, she exhaled, and motioned her lips once more.</p>
<p>“So.”</p>
<p>“Mm?”</p>
<p>“Ye be thinkin’ ‘bout ol’ muscle-pate ‘gain, ey?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I…  I have been, yes…”</p>
<p>There was little avail to be had in hiding it now.  Emilie was well-aware: many a sigh had left her mouth of late, after all.  Perhaps even her countenance was conspicuously clouded, a gloomy pall for all to wonder and worry over.</p>
<p>But they were not fools.  To them, the source was clearer than uncoloured crystal.</p>
<p>“Bet ye both could’ve been a fine couple; the talk o’ the town, even,” Raakel admitted, “were he ord’nary like the rest o’ us, odyl an’ all, that is.”</p>
<p>To this, Emilie was silent.  It was, by now, a world she had dreamt of far too many times to count.  A world where Rolf was given his due.</p>
<p>From Yoná to him, a measure of odyl not more than a common man’s.</p>
<p>Nay.  Even less would have sufficed.  So long as it wasn’t naught at all.  Were he blessed so, however meagerly, then maybe…</p>
<p>Just maybe…</p>
<p>How fruitless and fallow a fancy it was.  But to Emilie, it was one she could not have gone long without humouring, if even to her own sorrow.</p>
<p>“Well, the fates won’t bless a man an’ woman both just ‘cause they be warm to each other, ye should know.  Life be a mite more fickle than that, I’m ‘fraid.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I were warm to one meself, once upon a time,” Raakel confessed, faintly forlorn.  “A man I thought was me destiny.  Truly.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“A dozen winters between us, it were.  But I loved him.  I really did.  Couldn’t think o’ me future days without him bein’ in the same picture.”</p>
<p>That such soft words could ever issue from Raakel’s lips was a whelming wonder to Emilie.  Certainly, the mareschal measured the Owlcrane warrior to be youthful and fair in her own way.  But Raakel was a soul who sought—and found—purpose in battle, and nothing else.  That was Emilie’s long-held estimation of her, though admittedly one shaded with shame for how shallow it was.</p>
<p>“He were a bastard son, y’see.  A viscount’s, no less.  There was naught at all what could’ve stopped us from bein’ happy together… well, that’s what I thought, anyway,” Raakel recounted, uncharacteristically quiet.  “His half-siblings—heirs, all o’ them—died, one after the other.  So his pa suck’d it up and call’d him home.  Made him heir an’ all that.”</p>
<p>“I… I see.  And so… he was given a bride, then.”</p>
<p>“That he was, yea.  Wedded to some dainty gentlelady.  I weren’t a good pick.  Not noble ‘nough, see.”</p>
<p>“And… what did he say?”</p>
<p>“Well, the whole deal was a bite to his arse, ‘course, but thass aristocracy fer ye.  Couldn’t do aught ‘bout it, really.”  Raakel blinked slowly at the stars.  “We had one last moment together.  Hug’d, an’ cry’d fer a long while… an’ that was that.”</p>
<p>The Owlcrane warrior—in her frailer years, tight in the arms of a man, her tears telling of the painful parting to come.  Hardly a fanciable scene, certainly, but there was a look on Raakel’s countenance, one of softly distant eyes and a smile ready to fade at any moment.  Seeing it, Emilie knew then that what her friend recounted was the bare and unblemished truth.</p>
<p>“Things—they hardly turn out.  An’ that be the gist o’ it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, Raakel…”</p>
<p>“Yer the same, ain’t ye, love?  The Lady Emilie Mernesse, Dame Mareschal to the 5th Chivalric Order.  Ye’ve got yer family to protect, an’ knights to lead withal.  All the trappings o’ a trap, chain’d to yer ankles both.”</p>
<p>Resigning from her vaunted post was a frequent thought in Emilie’s heart, but it was never to be.  Not while she had yet to find a foothold for her family.  Not while there was a betrothal to consummate.  What’s more, her responsibilities as mareschal of late had ballooned along with Londosius’ whetted appetite for war.  Thus the time to run away from it all had long since left; to even entertain the notion was vain.</p>
<p>These troubles and more were never spoken of to the Owlcranes.  But deep down, they knew.  After all, they were each, by now, roostmates too intimate with their mareschal to not notice.</p>
<p>“Life be a bunch o’ things we can’t do aught ‘bout, things what go the way we never thought they could.  Innit?”</p>
<p>For King and Country.</p>
<p>For thine own Family and fellow Man.</p>
<p>Feudalism is the foundation of this society.  To renounce one’s Duty is reckless.  To defy the Ways is death.  A most natural course, like the ebb and flow of the tides, the arc of the sun and moon, the comings and goings of the seasons.  Such was the meaning in Raakel’s words.</p>
<p>But to air them so was not easy, for she was certainly not the sort to engage in intimate talk.  Only with the help of many helpings of ale was Raakel able to work up the will to console Emilie.  None of this was lost to the mareschal; upon realising it, she couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p>“So…  I guess you’ve had your own fair share of heartbreak, haven&#8217;t you?”</p>
<p>“No beatin’ ‘round the bush here, Emilie,” Raakel smiled back.</p>
<p>“Beat around what bush, now?”</p>
<p>“Can’t see me in a gorgeous gown, can ye?  I <i>were</i> a prim an’ prissy princess once, ye know.  Well, shy an’ shelter’d, more like.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;You’re right.  I really <i>can’t</i> see you in a gown.”</p>
<p>Maul in hand, a whirlwind of a womanーRaakel the ruffian.  As she was now, there was indeed nary a wisp of her princely past.  A look at her and one would be forgiven for believing she was born with a battleaxe wrapped in her babe-fingers.  Emilie certainly had, and doubtful she was alone in making the mistake.</p>
<p>“With baggage like that, I thought to put it all behind me.  So, I cut me ties.  Came to the Order,” Raakel went on.  “Was all pain at first, to be frank, like I were punishin’ meself fer me past follies.  I fought an’ fought, on an’ on.”</p>
<p>There are those who saw the world for what it was, and despaired at the sight.  The sorry souls would oft consign themselves to life in a convent, cloistered from the goings-on beyond.  But another path can be found, one that wends into the bowels of battlefields.  Not few are they who chose it instead.</p>
<p>Yet never could Emilie have guessed that Raakel counted amongst them.</p>
<p><i>One can never truly know another,</i> she thought.</p>
<p>“An’ thass how I forged me new motto.  Strength be ev’rythin’.  Fightin’ be ev’rythin’.  Naught else matters.”</p>
<p>Raakel shook her head, as if to silence the echoes of a past she’d long since left behind.  The two stood there for another while, deep in thought.</p>
<p>“Thass why…” Raakel began again, low, but firm, “&#8230;thass why I <i>hate</i> him, an’ all whimperin’ wimps like ‘im.”</p>
<p>Words of resolve.  A resolve by the name of “wrath”.  For Raakel was a woman who relinquished everything to seek but one thing: strength.</p>
<p>Emilie was a mareschal, unequalled in all of the 5th.  But not only that, she well-fulfilled the duties of both her office and her societal obligations in tandem.  Such was strength, Raakel concluded, and for that, Emilie was surely someone to be respected.</p>
<p>And then there was Rolf.  The man ungraced, a weakling who chose to flee rather than fight.  For him, Raakel knew naught but anger.</p>
<p>But weakness was not the only crime he committed.</p>
<p>Indeed, he was a cowardly cur most unwilling to confront even that selfsame weakness.  Such a mien of sallowed meekness was the very thing that Raakel detested, and thus did Rolf earn her scalding scorn.</p>
<p>“Raakel…  I… I never knew.”</p>
<p>Things none can do aught about.  Things that turn out not as they ought to.  These were Raakel’s own words.  Defiance was cheap in a world so unforgiving; this, too, she understood well.</p>
<p>Even so—or, perhaps, it was precisely so that she sought strength on the battlefield, the one place unfettered from the shackles of society.  To be strong was to be human.  To fight was to be human.  This was the compass of Raakel’s conscience, of a woman who saw battle to be life itself.</p>
<p>Rolf is weak.</p>
<p>Emilie is strong.</p>
<p>He who is feeble, who is not fain to face his own faults, is so to the sorrow of she who is mighty.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>The weak weave sadness for the strong.</p>
<p>The ill irony could not find acceptance in Raakel’s heart.</p>
<p>“&#8230;We put us lives on the line, don’t we?  To bring the world back to how it were, like the scriptures say,” Raakel began to reason.  “Thass why <i>I</i> say strength be whole and holy, an’ weakness be naught but a vice, a <i>sin.</i>  But look at ol’ mickle-berk.  All that muscle an’ he can’t be arsed to stand up to his own weakness.  That…”</p>
<p>An impalpable pang ran through the cold night air.  Emilie shivered, sobering before the sombre of the moment.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Thass the sort o’ sin I won’t pardon—ever.”</p>
<p>A feeble fledgling who but flew the coop.  That was Rolf, the fool fowl.  To worry over him was worthless.  Time was precious, to be spent elsewhere—anywhere, really, so long as it wasn’t on him.</p>
<p>That was the essence of Raakel’s message.  As Emilie lent ear to it, she found herself frozen by its undressed animosity.  In her own heart, there was anger over Rolf, of course.  But it was but a candle before the conflagration that was the world’s own ire for the man ungraced.</p>
<p>Of it, Emilie was reminded anew, whilst behind her speechless person, the tiny tumult in the tiny tavern clamoured on quietly through the night.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>Three full moons I’ve counted, since my arrival here at the margravate of Ström.</p>
<p>In that time, the fatality rate amongst the fort’s soldiery had plummeted.  It was done: Balasthea had at last lost its place amongst the realm’s most notorious killing fields.</p>
<p>Reporting to Margrave Ström of such trends and goings-on numbered amongst my many duties.  Today, too, found me fulfilling that office, as I stood before the lord at his Arbel residence.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Very well, then.  Keep the course, Commandant,” he said, turned away to the window.</p>
<p>“Yes, my liege.”</p>
<p>I saluted him, ending what had been quite the concise report.  With no further business there, I summarily left the manor.</p>
<p>Perhaps it bears little mention that the margrave was ever ill of mood upon our meetings.  Yet it was beyond all doubt that my deeds delivered to him much avail: Balasthea stood more firmly than ever before, and with its casualties curtailed, so, too, were the margrave’s military expenses.  For that reason, despite my reviled repute as an ungraced, not once did he attempt to dispose of me.</p>
<p>Equally doubtless, I suspected, was the indignance surrounding my assumption to Acting Commandant of Balasthea, whether harboured by the margrave or Central itself.  Likely they thought the ungainly ungraced would slip up soon enough, given so prestigious a post.  A shame their “expectations” were betrayed.</p>
<p>Yet verily I was, to them, a rather convenient pawn as commandant, one better left upon the gameboard till his moves were spent.  A bitter medicine of truth for their throats, sure, but one they swallowed nonetheless.  And from the look of things, it would be a daily taste upon their tongues.</p>
<p>Speaking of tastes, it was made apparent to me that the fort commandants of other provinces were oft treated to fetes hosted in the pleasure of their lords.  Just the thought of such wining and dining was a surfeit too sour for my palate.  Thus one can say I shared in the margrave’s convenience, though not so uncomfortably: our interactions were strictly business—quick and curt—and when such business was done and dealt with, I was more than happy to quit his quarrelsome company.</p>
<p>These thoughts I humoured as I made my way home.  Well, “home” in this case was a residence officially furnished to the commandant of Balasthea.  Being also within the confines of Arbel, the commute was none too terrible.</p>
<p>And perhaps “official residence” is a term too high-brow for what was nothing more than a rather small cot.  A home fit for but one, it was ostensibly stayed in by the many commandants before me.  My predecessor, taken ill as he was, had returned to his homestead elsewhere, thus was the cot allotted to me.</p>
<p>It was by no means a freshly founded home.  But even its dusty spaces were preferable to the sweaty barracks at the 5th.  Curious indeed that my standard of living improved only upon being exiled.</p>
<p>Today, however, was to be the beginning of many more curiosities, for I found myself stopped before the high street leading home.  Closed off, it was.  The forgathered townsfolk told of a flame burning further ahead, and of the firemen barring traffic to keep passers-by away from their dangerous work.</p>
<p>Thus by this pure coincidence was I compelled to take a detour down an alley outside of my usual commute.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Through the shadowy alleyways I wended.  The sun had long set, and the sky above was a fading fuchsia, cut down to a soaring strip by the jumbled and jostling roofs.  Hence did I brave this veritable labyrinth with a lantern in hand.  Yet it was not long before I stumbled upon a middle-aged man, standing hunched, haggard of breath, his own hand gripping a knife—one adrip with blood.</p>
<p>The drops pitter-pattered upon neither dirt nor cobblestone, but more of its red self.  For at the man’s feet was another figure, younger, yet placid and prostrate upon a pool of flowing crimson.  A look at the collapsed fellow found etched about his ankle a telling tattoo.</p>
<p>I raised the lantern for a better look.</p>
<p>“&#8230;That lad there a slave?” was my guarded question.</p>
<p>To me the man turned, growling.  “Yea.  An’ a bloody criminal,” he drawled.  “Shog’d off ‘is shackles, ‘e did.  An’ tried t’take me knife, so I show’d ‘im the pointy end o’ it, heheh.  Well, I jests, but the bloke’s dead, an’ me profits ‘long with ‘im.  An’ <i>that</i> ain’t a joke.”</p>
<p>Shackles, profits—a slaver, the man was.  I then found him bent over, wiping his knife clean upon the fresh corpse.  Sheathing it, he turned to me again, face half-furrowed.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Wot?  Think me the villian ‘ere, is it?  Ye be glad t’know then, this sinner snuff’d out two souls ‘imself in ‘is time.  Got wot’s comin’ to ‘im, I says.”</p>
<p>A rather defensive tone.  It would seem he spied an air of condemnation upon my face, my brows having bent bitterly without my knowing.</p>
<p>It must be said that the laws of Londosius deem slavery a sound practice, so long as it is purposed for manual labour.  But those same laws also decree that none save felons and “fruits of war” may be subject to the shackle.</p>
<p>The former—”criminal slaves”, they’re called—are typically those whose sins are judged to be grave, though not enough to warrant an execution.  The corpse before me was of this unsavoury sort, if the slaver was to be believed.</p>
<p>“I’ll not blame you for the deed.  Only…” I said, pointing behind him, “&#8230;that one, too, be a ‘sinner’?”</p>
<p>Indeed.  Another slave stood upon the scene.  Silent.</p>
<p>“Hah!  Can’t ye tell, lad?  A war-slave, this one is.  The worst o’ the worst.  Evil incarnate!” he smiled, but with a look at the foresaid slave, the bitter grin vanished into the dark.  “Eh, I takes it back.  ‘Evil’ ain’t ‘nough t’judge this devil.”</p>
<p>War-slaves—persons dragged from the fires of battle and into chains of iron.  In other words, captive Nafílim.  The one I pointed to was a clear example, and also the first of whom I’d seen beyond the bounds of a battlefield.</p>
<p>Only, this Nafíl was but a little girl.</p>
<p>I then recalled the quarrel with the margrave three months past.</p>
<p>Most certainly, it is the common creed of Man, shared amongst the sons of his many realms, that the Nafílim are to be spared from no cruelty, whether it be of violence or imprisonment.</p>
<p>Nevermind whether the Nafílim victims themselves are combatants—or otherwise.</p>
<p>I had made my case to the margrave then, and it stood unchanged now: this creed found no home in my heart.</p>
<p>The girl before me attested to the “why” of it: none, not even a Yonaistic devout, could feign a look upon her and say with right mind that aught about her became that of a “combatant”.</p>
<p>No.  She was just a small girl, maybe ten in her years, no more than twelve.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img src="https://i0.wp.com/lightnovelstranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sskvol2illus04.png?resize=759%2C1079&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="759" height="1079" class="wp-image-118077" data-recalc-dims="1" />
<p>Behind her black, soiled, and unkempt hair were amber eyes, both of which did naught but gaze at the ground, as if bereft of any and all spark of spirit.  And clothing the light tenné of her skin were nothing more than meagre, threadbare rags.</p>
<p>She stood there, still.  Oh so very still.  As if she’d given up on everything—even life itself.</p>
<p>“Awfully young for a slave,” I cuttingly observed.</p>
<p>“Yea?  An’ wot ‘bout it?” the slaver cut back.  “A <i>Nafíl,</i> it be.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Of course she is.”</p>
<p>I turned to her once more, lighting her lightless mien with my lantern.  No response was to be found.  She merely stood, soundless and downcast, her bare and shackled feet planted upon the cold cobblestones.</p>
<p>“Look at it,” the slave shook his head.  “All glum an’ gloom-like.  Can’t sell it off fer the life o’ me.  Bah!  Bloody <i>alga…”</i></p>
<p><i>“Alga?”</i></p>
<p>“Yea.  <i>‘Alga’</i> be wot I calls it.  Shiverin’ in a stove, it were, when the snatchers came a-snatchin’.  They drag’d it out an’ found it all steep’d in soot, they did.”</p>
<p><i>Alga…</i></p>
<p>How curious a connection.</p>
<p>Was it the whispers of the fates I heard just now?</p>
<p>Or something felt from deep in my heart?</p>
<p>A stirring within, welling up to leave my lips.</p>
<p style="text-align: center">“I’ll buy her.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>From my lips left those words, simple, yet urged by neither imagination nor motivation.  To be sure, not once before have I humoured the thought of buying a slave for myself.</p>
<p>And yet, here I was.</p>
<p>“B… <i>buy,</i> ye said?”</p>
<p>“I did.”</p>
<p>What was it that scribed my words?  That put them to air?  That steeled my resolve?</p>
<p>Was it sympathy?  Empathy?  A defiant cry against the caprice and cruelty of this world?</p>
<p>Perhaps a pang of compassion for the poor girl, who so suffered the scorn of others, just as I had?</p>
<p>Or was it guilt?</p>
<p>The heavy burden borne by a man of battle, whose very words and deeds compelled the creation of these war-slaves?</p>
<p>“A million reugoles.  An’ two-hundred thousand more.  Thass me price,” said the slaver, fingers raised.  “‘ow ‘bout it?  Yer purse fat ‘nough, lad?”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>Not cheap, but not beyond my means either.</p>
<p>While my time at the Order had earned me all but a regular pittance, I was also quite the penny-pincher.  Add to that the salary from my post here at Ström, with which I’ve done little but let pile up, and no lie was to be found in my curt assurance to the slaver, whose face brightened as his ears drank it up.</p>
<p>“W-well then—oh, but er… a word o’ warnin’ ‘fore we settles the deal,” he said, now lowly.  “Don’t ye go tellin’ it yer name, eh?”</p>
<p>I blinked.  “And why’s that?”</p>
<p>“This one.  It’s got a knack fer magicks—the covenantal kind, that is.  Can’t make a slave out o’ weavers o’ battle magicks, thass certain.  But not so with this one.  Well, I says that, but covenants be proper wicked in their own way, yea?”</p>
<p>I see.  Fair enough.</p>
<p>To consummate the purchase of a slave, a sort of covenantal magick must first be woven, binding bondsman to master.  A “thrallspell”, as it were.  This, too, is decreed by Londosian law.</p>
<p>Yet one who, from the outset, is gifted in or knowing of covenantal magicks may, naturally, overwrite the essence of such thrallspells.  To do so, only the name of the other party is needed.  Hence the slaver’s warning: if the master’s name is known, the so-gifted slave may turn the tables, and make himself master of his own master.</p>
<p>“So er… we gots a deal still, good lad?”</p>
<p>“We do.”</p>
<p>“Hah!  Chuff’d t’hear it, I am!” the slaver gleamed with glee.  “Phew.  Here I thought, t’day be ‘nother stinkin’ day, wot with <i>that</i> one dead an’ burnin’ a hole in me pocket.  But fates be fair, t’bring me a buyer fer <i>this</i> one—all in the same moment, no less!  Hwahah!”  After a toothy cackle, he turned to the girl.  “Oi, alga.  Sold ye off t’this kind ser, I did.  Good on ye, ey?”</p>
<p>Silence.</p>
<p><i>“Tch.</i>  Oi, ‘ow ‘bout a smile, at least, ah?”</p>
<p>“Has she got a name?” I asked.</p>
<p>A shake of the head.  “Damn’d if I know.  ‘Alga’ be all I calls it.  An’ ye should too, if it pleases ye.  If not, well, call it aught what suits yer fancy then, heheh.”</p>
<p>Never in the uncaring course of the slaver’s words did the little girl budge by the tiniest bit.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>The next day.</p>
<p>With my duties done at Balasthea, I returned to Arbel at twilight.  There, I finished off one more duty for the day: paying the million and more reugoles, having the thrallspell incanted for the Nafílim girl and me, and so on.  All were handled by the slaver of yesterday, whom I made sure to enquire of eschewing that shackling spell.  But as expected, he was quick to expound to me the illegality of the very notion.</p>
<p>It couldn’t be helped.  I was not wont to break any laws, thus, pressing the issue no further, I sealed the deal and soon found myself at home.  There in the sitting room did we stand, the girl and I.</p>
<p>I certainly had the manners to offer her a seat to rest her sore feet, but it was for naught.  The girl merely stood and stood, silent and stolid of soul.</p>
<p>And so I knelt before her.  With my eyes level with hers, I then asked my first question.</p>
<p>“What’s your name?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>No answer.</p>
<p>A sorry surrender anchored her vacant stare to the floor.</p>
<p>“Right.  Names come later.  We should get you washed up first,” I relented.</p>
<p>I then went to warm up some water, with which I filled a large basin.  After setting it beside the girl, I knelt before her once more.</p>
<p>“Look—I’ve left a flannel right here,” I said, pointing to a washcloth hanging upon the rim of the basin.  “You can wipe yourself down with it.  Will you do that for me?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“I’ll not hurt you.  Don’t worry,” I assured her.  “Well, I might not seem like it, I admit, having just emptied my coffers for a slave, but… I do mean it.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>First and foremost, some understanding was needed between the both of us, but as I feared, my words fell flat.  In lieu of answering, she went on watching the wooden floor, eyes empty of emotion.</p>
<p>“&#8230;I’ll not hurt you.  Truly.”</p>
<p>Another try.  The same line, admittedly.</p>
<p>How vacuous a vocabulary I had.  A damn shame; even I was exasperated at myself.  I searched and searched within, but the right words all escaped me—ones with which to reach her heart.</p>
<p>Helpless.</p>
<p>That was what I was.  Helpless.</p>
<p>Was there aught I could do for her?</p>
<p>Battlefields demand deeds, of which I would readily oblige.  But words were needed here.</p>
<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Deeds?</p>
<p>Perhaps action might avail me here?  To communicate to her what words cannot?</p>
<p>It was worth a try.  Too much of a tongue-twisted want-wit was I, when it came to sensible things to say.</p>
<p>And so I slowly reached out a hand to her.  A deed decided, deliberate and delicate.</p>
<p>She seemed the frailest of figures, one who might shatter at the slightest nudge.  But were either of us to remain fearful of the intimate touch, then certainly the day could never come.  The day when our eyes can gladly meet—and our hearts along with them.</p>
<p>Gently, and gentler still…</p>
<p>…my callused hand set upon her soft cheek.</p>
<p>And for the faintest moment, I sensed a quiver in her eyes.</p>
<p>For however much she seemed a soul surrendered of all life, there was yet warmth welling up from that cheek of hers.  Thus I stayed as I was, surrendered of all words.  A long lull stretched on.  In it: silence, save for the breaths rolling from our lips.</p>
<p>Yet how long of a lull exactly?  Where we but faced each other, connected by a simple touch?  I could not know, but by its eventual end, the girl’s eyes slowly, oh so slowly, searched up to meet mine.</p>
<p>Our gazes locked at last.</p>
<p>I remained there, returning my regard, with not a thought to utter a word.  Instead, I tried a bit of a smile, albeit a clumsy one.  I never could trust myself to smile with any grace.  A fumbling affair, it’s always been.</p>
<p>Her own regard, an amber-gold stare, fixed itself upon my onyx-black own.  Indeed, hers were round and heartfully fair… only, they cast a most heartbroken glint.  A reflection, hollow of any hope for tomorrow.</p>
<p>With all I could muster, I set into my gaze a simple promise.</p>
<p>A promise to never hurt her.</p>
<p>And as I did, I wished dearly that it reached her heart.</p>
<p>By the end of those many moments, my hand left her cheek just as gingerly as it had reached out to it.</p>
<p>“I’ve some shopping to do,” I said at last.  “Food, clothes, whatnot.  Be good while I’m gone, will you?  And wash yourself up for me.”</p>
<p>With that, I rose and left the house.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>The soft evensky began to twinkle as I walked down the thoroughfare leading to the markets.  Yet I had not the mind to take in the dusking townscape.  My thoughts were trained elsewhere.</p>
<p>I knew not of what impelled me to purchase the girl like I did.  And I knew even less of what I wished to do from here on.</p>
<p>Did I truly believe that I could avail her in some way?</p>
<p>Am I even capable of forging for her—or anyone, for that matter—some semblance of a future?</p>
<p>Me?</p>
<p>An ungraced?</p>
<p>A muscle-pated pawn who knows little beyond a smattering of swordplay?</p>
<p>What could I accord her?  What could I teach her?  What could I <i>do</i> for the poor girl?  She seemed utterly lost—a soul that had given up.</p>
<p>And yet, I knew not even her name.</p>
<p>I knew not by whom, and through what dark paths she was led to arrive in this place.</p>
<p>Of where she once lived.</p>
<p>Of the life she once had.</p>
<p>Of what she cherished.</p>
<p>Of what she dreamt.</p>
<p>Of the people she knew.</p>
<p>Of the family she loved.</p>
<p>…And of what circumstance that made her into what she was today.</p>
<p>“&#8230;’Won’t know till you try,’ they say,” I thought aloud.</p>
<p>Night was falling.  A darkness not unlike the murk of the alleyway where we first met.  She did all but stand there, empty of aught—even of fear for her slaver, for the bloody knife clenched in his hand, for her fellow slave then lying dead on the ground.</p>
<p>Witless as I was, I knew wholeheartedly of one thing: to just leave her there was never a choice.</p>
<p>The life of a war-slave is crushing.  Excruciating.  Ruthless.  Yet for however much they suffer, their numbers are far from few.</p>
<p>Saving the girl does naught to change that tragic truth.</p>
<p>Saving the girl was naught but a self-serving solace.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Most certainly.</p>
<p>And yet…</p>
<p>More certain again was that I did what I did because I believed it the right thing to do.</p>
<p>I saved her because I <i>wanted</i> to.  And simply that.</p>
<p>“Wayward vagrants, you and I.  A glad thing indeed if we can get along.”</p>
<p>The vague hope, upon a half-hale voice, vanished into the night sky.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>There once lived a little girl.</p>
<p>A Nafílim girl.</p>
<p>Tender and bright.  A child of much love.</p>
<p>Her mother was fair as a flower, and famed for it.  And from her did the daughter inherit a gaze of amber and locks of obsidian.</p>
<p>Eyes, large and lovely.</p>
<p>Hair, long and lustrous.</p>
<p>Over the coming moons and winters, she was sure to bloom into a shimmering belle herself.</p>
<p>Six was her family.</p>
<p>Her father, giant yet gentle.</p>
<p>Her mother, beautiful yet benevolent.</p>
<p>Her brother and two sisters—elders to her, all of them—were each copious of ken and principled of personage.</p>
<p>And the girl—a springtide sprout, ever smiling.</p>
<p>Smiling, smiling, amidst the sunshine that was her family.</p>
<p>In it was warmth.</p>
<p>In it was serenity.</p>
<p>In it was happiness.</p>
<p>But over yonder whirled the wheels of war.</p>
<p>Every which way.  At every corner of the continent.</p>
<p>A great war waged with Men.</p>
<p>Her mother and father did their best to keep its tidings at bay, that their dear daughter might know not a moment of worry.  A difficulty, for beyond their home-forest spanned the fields and halls of Man.</p>
<p>And from time to time from such places, Men in their arms and armour would sally, with greed in their eyes, with grim in their hearts.</p>
<p>Of this, the girl knew.  Despite the pains of her parents, she knew.</p>
<p>Her people fought back.  Indeed, they fought back.  Unbroken.  Unafraid.</p>
<p>Only, a fearsome fort confounded their way.  And so, their retreats repeated, on and on.  And so, the fort endured, on and on.</p>

<p>Once upon a night, the girl was sound asleep.  But then by a tickle was she roused awake.  In her sight was the hand of her father, large and reliable, gnarled and knobby, the fingers of a proud bough.</p>
<p>“Awake?” he whispered. “Forgive me.”</p>
<p>There her father sat, beside her bed, quietly caressing her head.</p>
<p>“How precious your face, when asleep.  What father cannot adore it?”</p>
<p>A smile upon his lips.  Half sorry.  Half bittersweet.</p>
<p>Yet instead of forgiving him, the girl held her father’s hand with both of her own.</p>
<p>Tiny hands, clasped tightly about callused fingers.  The daughter’s grip could not hope to encircle the father’s.</p>
<p>But a smile was upon her lips, too, as she drew his hand closer.  Fast in its warmth, she closed her eyes.  Gladly, quietly, her father watched on, till once again his daughter sang the sounds of slumber.</p>
<p>How dearly she loved her father.</p>
<p>How dearly she treasured the surety of his hands.</p>

<p>How dearly she would come to miss him.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>

<p>Off her father went into the mists of dawn.</p>
<p>A woodcutter, he was.  But also a warrior.  So it was with all the brothers of the village.  Indeed, each of them bore his own burden of battle.</p>
<p>For days, the home was without its father.  On the third, he should be back.</p>
<p>Only, he wasn’t.</p>
<p>“A little late, your father.  But do lighten up.  Before next sundown, he’ll be home with us again.”</p>
<p>To her children at the supping table, the hope-woven words of the mother.</p>
<p>Trusting them, the girl sipped her stew.  Oh, what a favourite it was.</p>
<p>But then a thought occurred.  And so to her mother, she smilingly said thus.</p>
<p>“Mama!  Let’s make Papa’s favourite tomorrow!  Warm, warm lentil soup!”</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>Let’s.</p>
<p>The smiling answer of her mother.  The smiling agreement of her siblings.  But miring their mirth was unease.  One the girl was yet too young to sense.</p>

<p>The sun woke again, and so did she.</p>
<p>Up from her bed she sprang and through the house she flew, so eager to find her father home again.</p>
<p>Only, he wasn’t.</p>
<p>To the kitchen she came, where her mother busied herself with making breakfast.</p>
<p>Bread was baking.  The soft scent of rye.</p>
<p>“‘Morning, Mama!”</p>
<p>“Good morning, my little flower.”</p>
<p>A sunny smile from her mother.  Warm.  Assuring.  Just as always.</p>
<p>Soon, her siblings were gathered as well, and the family of five then sat at the table, to begin the day with filling their bellies.</p>
<p>“Many thanks for this meal.”</p>
<p>“Many-many thanks for this meal!”</p>
<p>Words of grace from the family.  Brightly so from the little girl.</p>
<p>The wisdom of thanksgiving, given to the children by mother and father both.</p>
<p>With measured manners, the girl took to hand a fluff of bread and nibbled upon its pillowy crumb.</p>
<p>“Papa not home yet…”</p>
<p>She yearned aloud.</p>
<p>But hope was hale in her.  Tonight, five will be six once more.  A happy six, all supping together.  And so, again, did she brave her father’s absence.</p>

<p>The girl then knitted away her morning hours.</p>
<p>Quilting was a craft best left to the artisans.  Certainly not something the fellow village children were capable of.</p>
<p>But her mother and sisters were skilled with the skein.  Loving them each and everything they do, she long mimicked them.  Those many moons of diligence had imparted to the girl some deftness in the art.</p>
<p>A hat.</p>
<p>What was, days ago, just a thread of yarn, would soon be a crocheted crown for her mother.</p>
<p>Father’s share was already finished.</p>
<p>A present for her parents.  To be given when they are together again.</p>
<p>Socks were what the girl wanted to make at first.  But a bit too difficult it might be, her elder sister said.  How about a hat, she then suggested.</p>
<p>That same sister now watched the girl warmly.  The tiny hands tamed the needle as the hat took shape.</p>
<p>Such a sight to smile upon.</p>
<p>But also a secret to be kept.</p>
<p>Not till the presents were complete could either parent know.</p>
<p>So requested the girl of her sister at the start, answered with giggling acceptance.  A promise protected till this day.</p>
<p>Noon came, and at last, the final thread was threaded.  Two hats together, graceless of form, but filled with gratitude.  Two messes of yarn, but to the girl, two masterpieces.</p>
<p>“Lovely hats, lovingly made.  Mother and Father will be most glad!”</p>
<p>Her sister’s seal of approval.</p>
<p>How happy they would be, mother and father both.  Dreaming of the moment, the girl beamed brightly.</p>

<p>A little later, a villager visited.</p>
<p>Mother met him at the door.  Words were shared for a while, and taken by a bit of unease, she left the house.</p>
<p>To her children, a promise to return by dusk.</p>
<p>Till then, the two sisters gave their time: an hour or two of play with the girl.</p>
<p>Suppertime was setting in.  Mother was sure to be home by now.</p>
<p>Only, she wasn’t.</p>
<p>“Lentils, lentils!  Warm lentil soup for supper!”</p>
<p>The girl sang with excitement.</p>
<p>Tonight, and together, they would all be gathered, to give their father his favourite, and enjoy it themselves in his sorely missed company.</p>
<p>A warm and lovely time it would be.  One the girl looked forward to.</p>
<p>And then came a buzz about the whole village.  Brother looked rather grave.</p>
<p>But the eldest sister could not bear it any longer.  To her feet, she rose.</p>
<p>“The orphanage… I must go look,” she said.  “Don’t worry.  I won’t be long.”</p>
<p>Charitable, her eldest sister was.  Ever a lender of helping hands for the orphanage, where lived children of parents lost to tragedy.</p>
<p>There was concern upon her face as she left the house in haste.</p>
<p>Not once before was there any warrant for worry.</p>
<p>What could it be?</p>
<p>The girl thought.</p>

<p>An hour went by.</p>
<p>Neither mother nor sister were returned.</p>
<p>By now, the village was veiled in some tumult.  Brother worried quietly.  His face was furrowed.  His heart was heavy.</p>
<p>A bellow.  From beyond the safety of home.  Angry.  Echoing.</p>
<p>The elder sister held the girl tightly, picking her up.</p>
<p>Brother sprang to his feet.  His eyes darted about.</p>
<p>The stove.  A hearth of much happiness, earthen, large.  Enough to cook for their family of six.</p>
<p>To it, he pointed.</p>
<p>To it, the sister rushed.</p>
<p>In it, she hid, with the girl wrapped in her arms.</p>
<p>“Be still!  Be silent!  Stay in there—no matter what!”</p>
<p>Brother’s whispers of warning.</p>
<p>To them, the sister nodded.  Cold beads of sweat sailed down her cheeks.  For an instant, they glinted.  In them, a reflection of the brother’s unbound blade.</p>
<p>Then by his hand, he sealed the stove.  Turning, he stepped towards the entrance.  But before he could emerge outside, into their home barged unsought visitors.</p>
<p>Three.</p>
<p>Three kins of Man.</p>
<p>Cold swords in their hands.  Cold armour binding their bodies.</p>
<p>Bellowing blurs of iron they became, sending steel to the brother.  There, he met them with his own sharpness.</p>
<p>The sound of clashing swords.  A first for the girl’s ears.  Her home, once filled only with happiness, now echoed with the throes of war.</p>
<p>Tightly and tighter still, the sister held her with bated breath.  Verily did she try to turn the girl away from the violence outside.  But to no avail.  The stove was too cramped inside.</p>
<p>How sad, then, that the girl could gaze through the grates, and see for herself the battle beyond.</p>
<p>She beheld in those gaps the sight of her brother brought down in cold blood.  Skilled he was with the blade, but not enough to fight three at a time.</p>
<p>And so the brother fell, cruelly cut.</p>
<p>And so the sister knew woe.</p>
<p>But keeping the scream from leaving her lips, she held the girl ever more tightly.</p>
<p><i>“Peh.</i>  Right pain in the arse, the scrawny scoundrel.”</p>
<p>“Ey.  Ye think there’s more?”</p>
<p>“More?  Well I don’t see… wait… ’ear that?”</p>
<p>The cold words of Men, whetted sharp.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;uu… hic…”</i></p>
<p>The warm tears of the little girl, wetting her sister’s bosom.</p>
<p>Happiness was all she knew.  And as well, the delightful days spent with her warm and loving family.  Such innocence was ill-prepared to bear the sight of it all breaking to pieces.</p>
<p>The lid flew open.</p>
<p>The sickening smiles of Men.</p>
<p>“Well well well.  Wot we ‘ave ‘ere, ey?”</p>
<p>“Hah!  Look at ‘em!  Steep’d in soot, the devils!”</p>
<p>Cold hands reached in.</p>
<p>Girl and sister both were dragged out.</p>
<p>By rope the two were tied up.</p>
<p>To the village square they were led down.</p>
<p><i>“Uuaah!  Aaaaah!”</i></p>
<p>The screaming sobs of the little girl.  The unceasing sorrow of her sister.  The sadistic smirks of the Men.</p>
<p>At their destination was found the villagers, bound and brought together.  Surrounding them were the soldiers of Men, jeering.</p>
<p>“Thass all o’ them.”</p>
<p>Said a Man, bringing the girl and her sister before the others.  Then, with a sharp shove to their backs, he sent the two tumbling down into the dirt.</p>
<p><i>“Aeck…!  …hic… uu…”</i></p>
<p>The girl continued to cry.</p>
<p>And there, echoing across the air, were their names.</p>
<p>A familiar voice.  The voice of their mother, vaulting, desperate.</p>
<p>To her the girl looked.  Mother, too, was bound amongst the villagers.</p>
<p>“Oh?  Wot’s this, now?  Those two brats be yers, is it?”</p>
<p>“Yer good pa’s come ‘ome, ‘e ‘as!  But ‘e be doin’ a lil’ ‘ide an’ seek!  Why don’t ye… be a good mam, yea?  Tell yer kiddies where the pa be ‘idden!”</p>
<p>Sinful words from sinful smiles, said to the mother.  Choosing not to obey, she but shook her head.</p>
<p>“Ey.  Ey!  I said, <i>tell ‘em!</i>  Ye bitch, you!”</p>
<p>“Why ye gots t’be a big boot in the arse, eh?  Bloody Nafílim.  Devils, the lot o’ ye!”</p>
<p>“Well thass all right, then.  We’ll tell ‘em fer ye, we will.  Oi.  Which one’s their pa, ey?”</p>
<p>“Should be eh… in that pile, methinks.  The one with all the run-aways from yesterbattle.”</p>
<p>“This one ‘ere, yea?”</p>
<p>The uncaring conversation of the Men.</p>
<p>“No!  Don’t!  Stop!  Sto—p!!”</p>
<p>The nigh-crazed cries of the mother.</p>
<p>There, a waggon sat, covered.  Then, by the hand of a soldier, it was covered no more.</p>
<p>At first, the girl could not comprehend what her eyes saw.</p>
<p>For they saw a heap of heads.</p>
<p>Each and every one of them, a face she knew.</p>
<p>And amongst them, a face she loved.  A face she missed.</p>

<p>The face of her father.</p>

<p>Her breath was wholly stolen.</p>
<p>The cold grip of the fates seemed to clench at her heart and lungs both.</p>
<p>Next to her was her sister, seized by the same shock.</p>
<p>Down and down, slowly and soundlessly, the girl’s gaze fell.</p>
<p>“C’mon now.  There’s yer pa!”</p>
<p>Called one of the Men, who then snatched the girl’s chin with his iron hand.  Back to the horrid heap he then made the girl look.</p>
<p>“See ‘im?  Nice smile on ‘is face, eh?  Heheh!”</p>
<p>“Sto—p!  Sto───p!!”</p>
<p>The wuthering wails of the mother.</p>
<p>But the girl had stopped crying.</p>

<p>Her eyes.</p>
<p>In her eyes was no longer the light of her heart.</p>

<p>“Yea, yea.  Playtime’s over, ye wankers.  Back t’work!”</p>
<p>“Right right.  Ey, ye devils!  Get in ‘ere, the lot o’ ye!”</p>
<p>And thus the Men had the girl, her sister, and some others make their way to another covered waggon.</p>
<p>But the girl budged not a bit.</p>
<p>“Ey, runt.  Get movin’.”</p>
<p>A Man’s command.  Yet the girl’s feet were unmoving.</p>
<p><i>“Tch.</i>  Oi, look ‘ere, you!  Get in, I says!”</p>
<p>No avail.  In his frustration, the Man called to another, who then held a blade to the mother’s neck.</p>
<p>“Oi, ye bloody brat!  Get a move on with yer sis!  I’ma count now, an’ if ye ain’t in the waggon by three, why, I’ll ‘ave yer mam join yer pa, I will!”</p>
<p>Oh, dearest daughter.  How the mother cried and cried.</p>
<p>Seeing the sword set against that neck, the girl slowly started moving.</p>
<p>Such pain and sorrow upon the sister’s face, as she picked up the little girl.  Quivering caresses were given.  Then, onto the deck they boarded.</p>
<p>Sister knew well where the waggons would go.</p>
<p>To where else but sunless suffering?</p>
<p>Yet even then, she thought only to comfort her little sibling.</p>
<p>“Right.  Got ‘em all loaded up now.  Let’s move!”</p>
<p>With a signal, the waggons were off.</p>
<p>“Oi, brother.  Wot ‘bout these ones, ey?”</p>
<p>“Eh, ferget ‘em.  They’ve got battle magicks, they do.  Can scarce make slaves o’ ‘em.  Bugger.”</p>
<p>A cruel conversation amongst Men yet in the village square.</p>
<p>“Rubbish, they be, eh?  Oi!  Off with their ‘eads now, yea!?”</p>
<p>Orders given.  Swords swung.</p>
<p>The Nafílim folk, bound and defenceless.  Each was felled.  One after another.</p>
<p>Home.</p>
<p>Now distant.</p>
<p>Forever distant.</p>
<p>The girl’s last sight of it was not to be forgotten.</p>
<p>The sight of her mother’s final moment.</p>
<p>Held tight in her sister’s arms, the girl lost all strength.</p>
<p>Something lingered on her cheeks, and now ran down.</p>
<p>“&#8230;hats… Mama… Papa…”</p>
<p>Her amber eyes dulled.</p>
<p>Now empty.</p>
<p>Oh, so empty.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>Whither the waggons whisked the little girl was a city of stone.</p>
<p>From the idyll of the fields and forests, and into the metropolitan maw of Man; there in the fangs of the fiefburgh was she caught, her fate it was to be made a slave.</p>
<p>But not immediately so, no.  Deals had to be done.  Prices had to be promised.  Not yet was she set and sold.</p>
<p>In the meantime, she was instead shackled and sent to the cages of a concentration camp.  A cold and unkind place where her kin and kind were kept, to await whatever ill reckoning may come—whether it be death by cruel treatment, or a life of enslavement.</p>
<p>Meagre scraps of food were afforded to her.  But it was beyond the girl’s broken will to muster up any sort of appetite.  Yet ate she tried, for fear of being served a meal of a different sort.  One of fury, of foul affronts.</p>
<p>Certainly, the soldiers there were loath to keep even one Nafíl alive.  Only, their pay coursed from margrave’s coffers, which filled all the more fully as he cashed out the captives to the slavers.</p>
<p>Thus was the girl not a cur to be culled, but a commodity to be kept intact—to the barest adequacy, that is.  With their wages on the line, the soldiers spared this “product” of her early death whensoever they had a mind to punish her.  In times when she ill-stomached her meal, they would whet her appetite with the whip, livid lashings sent to slash her back.</p>
<p>It was not long before they found her to be attuned to the covenantal magicks.  The discovery threw the soldiers into a flying fit of rage, for to be so ungainly gifted was injurious indeed: her prospective price was now but a pittance.</p>
<p>As punishment, fists and feet were driven into her belly, till she collapsed onto the cold stone floor, vomiting what little sustenance she had ably swallowed.</p>
<p>But to do so was alike to not having eaten it at all.  Thus another punishment was in order.  The Men, with their wrath unravelled, thrust torches onto her thighs.</p>
<p>There, she writhed.</p>
<p>She screamed.</p>
<p>She cried.</p>
<p>A sight most sorry—ostensibly enough to soften the soldiers’ veins, for they soon quit the cell.</p>
<p>In it, she was then all alone, left to weep the days away.  A gaol most dark, where echoed the girl’s grief forevermore.</p>
<p>But there was a soul within the soldiery who acted not like the others.  One of many turnkeys keeping the peace in the prisons, the guardsman seemed the sort to sympathise with the girl’s plight.</p>
<p>“Well, er…  Yer sis be alive still, yea?” he revealed quietly, “&#8230;‘ang in there, if not fer the lass, at least.”</p>
<p>With that, he went about his way.  The Man, forty in his years, perhaps, apparently kept the girl’s elder sister, too, under his watch.  Hence any occasion where he crossed the girl’s cell was also an opportunity to glean from his yet lukewarm heart the condition of her sister—of the sole vestige of her dear family.</p>
<p>By his words, the sister was haggard and unhale, a young woman wasting away.  Only, she yet had the will to partake of her meals, and that was hope enough.</p>
<p>The moment the girls first entered the concentration camp was the moment they were torn from each other, to be locked up in separate cells.  By then, the little girl had lost all strength to raise even a whisper of protest.  So it was that she could do naught but shed tears, watching on as the soldiers sent her sister away.</p>
<p>The days since then were a long and enduring darkness, empty of aught but pain and punishment.</p>
<p>And of worry.</p>
<p>Indeed, much of the girl&#8217;s waking hours were spent deep in thought for her sister.  In the mire of such uncertain circumstance, what could she do but worry?  And so worry she did, on and on, of what might befall upon her dear sibling.</p>
<p>This was always so for any member of her family.  In each of them was instilled a selfless sympathy for the other.  Perhaps truest for the girl, ever a child who thought more of her family than of herself.</p>
<p>More than once did such compassion compel her to speak to the soldiers, but their answers were always of cold violence.</p>
<p>The sole exception being the foresaid guardsman.</p>
<p>In him, she sensed some possibility of discourse.  Thus she mustered up what meagre courage remained in her heart, and enquired him of what fate awaited her sister.</p>
<p>And sure enough, what moved were not his fists, but his lips, quietly.</p>
<p>“Same as ye, methinks.  A war-slave, she’ll be, made t’do ‘er master’s biddin’.”</p>
<p>A thoughtful silence followed, in which was found the Man with his eyes cast wistfully.</p>
<p>“I’ve got a lass o’ me own, I do.  Weren’t more than ten ‘fore she went t’serve a lord,” he spoke again.  “Mm… ‘ow many years it’s been, eh…?  I’ve not seen ‘er since.  She be doin’ all right, I wonder…?”</p>
<p>And with those words, the girl was left alone once more.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>

<p>At the end of many sunless days, it was at last decided where the girl was to be handed off.  Not more than a week now till a slaver would come to collect her.</p>
<p>News of unknown portent, most certainly.  On-duty during the night it was given was none other than the pitying turnkey himself.</p>
<p>“Not sure if this’ll brighten yer day or wot, but…” he broached, before relating to the girl of further news: that she and her sister were to be reunited and sold off together.</p>
<p>A light, then, the girl felt.</p>
<p>A light within all the dark.</p>
<p>Faint, yes, but one lit at last.</p>
<p>No day was without pain.  No day was without suffering.  No day was without sorrow.  But her sister was still alive, and that was reason enough to endure them.  To keep the family’s memory.  To breathe the life given to her.</p>
<p>For her one and only remaining bond.</p>
<p>For her warm and loving family.  So dear.  So dear.</p>
<p>She had lost enough.  No more could she bear.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Sister…  Sister…”</p>
<p>Whispers within the dark.  Tears within the solitude.</p>
<p>Ones different from before.</p>
<p>Oh, to be together again.</p>
<p>Only two now, but together nevertheless.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Well.  Good on ye, eh?”</p>
<p>From beyond the iron bars, a warm smile.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>

<p>“Oi, <i>alga!</i>  Out with ye!”</p>
<p><i>Alga.</i></p>
<p>An epithet earned from the peculiarity of her captivity.  A soot-steeped girl, hiding in the earthen hearth of her home, only to be dragged out by the hands of Man.</p>
<p>The air still rang from its utterance as Men dragged her out yet again, this time from her sunless cell and out to the sunlit grounds.  A morning scene to herald her purchase.</p>
<p>The girl wended the way barefoot, with shackles at her ankles and wrists, and naught but rat-eaten rags as her raiments.  To the camp’s service gates was she led, pulled along by chains at the hands of the soldiers.  There, she would have to wait.  The slavers had yet to arrive.</p>
<p>Restless was her gaze as it glanced about.</p>
<p>Her sister was nowhere to be found.</p>
<p>In the midst of the confusion, she spotted the Man of pity.  Their eyes met, and so she thought to speak to him.</p>
<p>“uh… um…”</p>
<p>“Shut yer trap, runt!” howled her chain-handler.</p>
<p>“Now now, brother, s’all right.  We talk’d ‘bout this,” soothed the gentle guardsman.</p>
<p>“Ah?  Wot, she the one, then?”</p>
<p>Knowing looks.  Knowing nods.  The Man then turned to the girl.</p>
<p>“Worry’d ‘bout yer sis, yea?”</p>
<p>“y… yes…”</p>
<p>“Look.”</p>
<p>The Man thrust forth his thumb, pointing to a corner of the concentration camp.</p>
<p>A hollow was dug there.</p>
<p>At its edge was something set to be thrown into its depths.</p>
<p>“A grave pit, that is,” the Man explained.  “Jailbirds that’ve ‘broken their wings’—well, that be where they fall, the lot o’ them.”</p>
<p>No eye could mistake it for aught else.</p>
<p>A mass grave, with not a gravestone to mark it.  And the “thing” to be thrown into it—naught but a corpse.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>

<p>“Burial’s a mite lateーperish’d a long while ‘go, she did.  The pneumonia got ‘er right good.  Never got better, ‘course.”</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;a… ah…”</i></p>
<p>The girl trembled.</p>
<p>“Wot?  Not that nither’d out ‘ere, is it?  Oh—yer sis?  Hah.  Yea, ‘er bein’ well ‘nough, an’ gettin’ sent off with ye—a funny lil’ lie, is all it were.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>She stood.  All but stood.</p>
<p>“Can’t ‘elp meself, ey,” the mummer of a Man smiled.  “Gaol-watchin’s bugger’d an’ borin’ work, it is.  Gots t’do somethin’ t’pass the time, yea?  Thass why me an’ the lads, we like t’prank ye prisoners sometimes, heheh.”</p>
<p>“Hah!  Hahah!  Oh, always the cruel one, ain’t ye, brother!”</p>
<p>“That some mighty fine mumm’ry it were, man!  If I were more a fool, why, I’d say ye was quite the lonely pa!  Wot with all that ‘daughter’ rubbish!”</p>
<p>“Yea, me: a bastard <i>bachelor</i> o’ a ‘pa’!  Hah!”</p>
<p>“Ahahaha!”</p>
<p>Their japery.  Their jeers.  All but a faraway fuss to the girl as she stared at what was once her sister.</p>
<p>Just a single glance.</p>
<p>A single one.</p>
<p>And she knew then and there the immovable truth.</p>
<p>That the body no longer harboured within it a wisp of life.</p>
<p>Her sister was ever fair, with her complexion of pastel tawn, and a warm smile ready at a moment’s notice to brighten the girl’s day.</p>
<p>Always had she given time for talk and play.</p>
<p>Always had she listened with a gracious grin.</p>
<p>Always was she a loving sister.</p>
<p>Until that moment, where she was but a limp and lifeless figure, blackened by a ruthless blight, silenced by dreamless sleep.</p>
<p>Until that moment, when she was tossed into the dim of the pit.</p>

<p><i>“&#8230;ah…”</i></p>

<p>The world was then shadowed.</p>
<p>The girl’s heart was then broken.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>Into the hands of a slaver she went.</p>
<p>No Man of this trade, to wit, would dare purchase for his own wheelings and dealings a slave with an affinity for the covenantal magicks.  But of affinities, the mercantile sort seemed spurned from this slaver.  Indeed, he was bereft of both clout and acumen, a tradesman of no repute in his trade.  Thus upon this fool was forced the purchase of the ungainly girl, and the Fiefguard’s traffickers were, by no means, wont to abide complaint.</p>
<p>A slave, in whom was instilled the potential to turn her master into her own slave.  What foul fortune.  To be damned with such dead stock, with so defective a product, was, to the slaver, a hounding headache.</p>
<p>“Oi.  <i>Alga,”</i> he growled at her.  “Bloody ‘ell.  Even yer mouth be broke, is it?  Eh?”</p>
<p>Often were the times when her reticence ignited his rage.  Often did her silence precipitate a beating by his hands.</p>
<p>But it was nothing worth caring about.</p>
<p>Not to the girl.</p>
<p>Not anymore.</p>
<p>The half-week of this hell was in no hurry to hie by.  At its end did the girl find herself stepping through a sunless alleyway, tugged along by the slaver.  Across the cold cobblestones her naked feet coursed, chains jangling with every pace, each as empty of speed as her lips were of speech.</p>
<p>Then, a gale of motion.</p>
<p>The fellow slave before her, a felon in his time, somehow shed off his shackles and assailed the slaver.</p>
<p>“Wot—b-bastard, you!”</p>
<p>A glint in the dark.  The draw of a knife.</p>
<p>The two Men struggled and strained against each other.  A brawl as brief as it was bloody, for when the dust settled, the aggressor was laid low.  His bosom bled.  His days, numbered.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Bloody shite!”</p>
<p>A stamp of the foot.  A spit upon the corpse.  The slaver, livid at the loss of his merchandise.</p>
<p>It was then that a light illuminated the alleyway.  Another Man arrived at the scene.  The lantern in his hand revealed his towering figure and the youth of his features.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>

<p>The slaver set the price, and the young Man paid up.  A deal sealed and settled; henceforth was the latter her master, and the girl his slave, in law, lot, and life.</p>
<p>The next evening, she was neither in the clogged alleys nor out upon the cold, scorning streets, but in the quaint quarters that was the young Man’s home.</p>
<p>But of homes, fear found none in her.  Beatings, burnings, or whippings.  Derision, deceit, or wrath.  The girl knew not of what was to come, but come what may, it mattered not.</p>
<p>For pain was no longer painful.</p>
<p>Yet the young Man said something rather peculiar.</p>
<p>“I’ll not hurt you.”</p>
<p>Peculiar indeed.  To be pained was now her purpose.  For why else was she here?</p>
<p>This, the girl thought.</p>
<p>But what the young Man endeavoured next further escaped all reason and expectation that the girl’s wit could muster.</p>
<p>His hand alighted upon her cheek.  Delicately so.</p>
<p>And there, stayed for many a moment.</p>
<p>The girl had lost all care and curiosity for the world, and she certainly nurtured none for the young Man.  Hence why she had hitherto given him not a single glance.</p>
<p>And hence, why she could not comprehend how it came to be that her empty gaze, in the course of that long lull, gingerly made its way up to meet his.</p>
<p>Then and there, a smile upon his rugged regard.</p>
<p>At the end of those innumerable moments, the young Man made himself absent.  Out to the streets he went, to—by his words—buy some food and clothes.</p>
<p>An errand rather abrupt.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had missed a meal during the day.</p>
<p>Perhaps he had not a change of attire for business on the morrow.</p>
<p>The girl could not know.  And truth be told, she had not the heart to care.</p>
<p>And for whatever reason, the young Man had left home not thinking to set chains upon her, slave that she was.  Instead, words were said.  That she was to “wash herself up”.</p>
<p>Sure enough, a basin of bathwater had been prepared and placed beside her.</p>
<p>An order from the young Man, perhaps?</p>
<p>Yes.  Orders are to be obeyed.  A teaching verily beaten into her during her time at the concentration camp.  Her heart may be too broken to act upon it, but her body recalled well enough to move by its own accord.</p>
<p>Off her battered body was her ragged raiment slipped off.</p>
<p>Then, with flannel in hand, into the basin she slowly went.</p>
<p>Sat in the bath, she began washing herself.</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>Water most warm.</p>
<p>A comfort not felt in three moons.</p>
<p>Warm?</p>
<p>Ah, yes.</p>
<p>Warm, as well, was the young Man’s hand.</p>
<p>A gentle and deliberate warmth, set upon her cheek.</p>
<p>To that same spot the girl’s own hand went, the caress of her fingers coursing across it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>

<p>With a sack in hand, filled with food and a set of clothes, I returned to the residence.  Opening the door revealed the Nafílim girl all but standing there, stark naked, having just finished her bath.</p>
<p>Keeping my composure as best I could, I quickly handed to her both a garment and a set of smallclothes.</p>
<p>“Here.  Wear these,” I said, before turning away.  Soon enough, the rustling of fabrics met my ears.  Not till its ceasing did I think to turn to the girl once more.</p>
<p>There she stood, shrouded in a simple chemise, plain and white.</p>
<p>Of course, no soul such as I could feign a feel for the intricacies of women’s fashion, thus I had I gone with the safest selection of clothes.  And glad was I that I did, for it seemed my sense was not mistaken.</p>
<p>The white fabric matched most splendidly with the fair tawn of her skin, uniquely Nafílim in its warm hue.</p>
<p>“It well-suits you.”</p>
<p>My concise conclusion, met with no overt response on the girl’s part.  Only, our eyes did meet at that moment.</p>
<p>Face-to-face as we were, I realised then that, though she was yet quite young, her visage was verily lovesome to behold.  Not before could I have perceived such grace, soiled as it was from her prior hardships.</p>
<p>I continued to gaze into her eyes, giving my all to find even the faintest wisp of emotion in them.  And in the course of trying to bridge our minds as best I could, I found her lips slowly parting open.</p>

<p>“&#8230;I… I’m… Mia…”</p>

<p>At last.</p>
<p>“Mia”.</p>
<p>Her name.</p>
<p>And a charming ring upon the ears, at that.</p>
<p>There was gladness in my heart.  To hear her name.  To hear her voice.  Thus I could not go for long without some words of my own.</p>

<p>“Good to meet you, Mia.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>

<p>And then there was mirth upon the young Man’s face.</p>
<p>A smile made with mustered sincerity.</p>
<p>For it was not in his nature to smile much.  And his life of late gave little to smile about.</p>
<p>But a smile it was, nonetheless.</p>
<p>The gladness of a large Man glowing upon a little girl.</p>
<p>For her part, she had earned it by doing little but looking back at length and airing her name purely out of politeness.</p>
<p>Yes.</p>
<p>A politeness, long ago once taught, now remembered.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>“…Now, Mia…  First, your name… to whomever you meet…”</i></p>

<p>Remembered, from within the mists somewhere deep down inside.  A voice most dear, and dearly departed.</p>
<p>And that was why she told him her name.  And only because of that.</p>
<p>Yet, the moment it met the young Man’s ears was the moment his heart welled with warmth and cheer.  For to him, it was a momentous moment, indeed.  A bond was born between them at last, he felt.</p>
<p>His gift of the white garment glimmered upon her person, breathing back the merry light of the hearth nearby.</p>
<p>But upon the young Man’s own person were spans of leather and plates of iron.  Attire not unlike the sort donned by the Men who marauded her home.  Thus he was, beyond any doubt, a Man of war-waging.</p>
<p>And what awaited him from here on out would certainly be more battles to come, burning and burgeoning evermore.</p>
<p>The young Man kneeling before her—</p>
<p>—at whom shall he bare the blade?</p>
<p>And for whom shall he swing the sword?</p>
<p>The answers—none, could the little girl have known.</p>
