<h2 style="text-align:center;">Ⅲ</h2>

<p>Ever was Rolf our paragon.</p>
<p>To everyone, the model Londosian, all the way since his greener days.</p>
<p>If aught could be known, he would know of it.</p>
<p>In aught he endeavoured, he would succeed in it.</p>
<p>Amongst his peers, his sword abided no rivals.  In his spars with the grown-ups, they, too, would know humility on occasion.</p>
<p>And as with the sword, so Rolf was with the book.  Not even the most cryptic essays on provincial governance were spared from his curiosity.  And ‘twas not such a rare sight to catch him in wordly discourse with our fathers, barons though they were.</p>
<p>He was perfect.  As a budding nobleman.  As a treasured son.  House Buckmann’s prospects seemed all but ensured.  None within its halls dared gainsay this.  They had scarce reason to.</p>
<p>And to such a prodigy was I betrothed.</p>
<p>There was promise between us.  A horizon we both looked fast to.  In those shining reaches awaited a happy ever-after.  A time we would share with all certainty for years, and years, and years to come.</p>
<p>To be at his side, from now till evermore—how blessed I felt.  How proud I was.</p>
<p>The many days we spent in each other’s company.  The many more days we would herald, together.</p>
<p>All seemed so brilliant.</p>
<p>Till there loomed a spot of darkness.</p>
<p>One by the name of the “Roun of Orisons”.</p>
<p>The day we were received at the divine rites was the day we found Rolf to be “ungraced”.  He but knelt there before the Reverend, his bosom cold of Yoná’s odyllic warmth, the quartz in his hands unbrightened by Her light.  And ‘twas so on that very same day, that the very same black spot yawned agape, like a maw beneath my feet, to swallow me whole.</p>
<p>‘Twas then that I knew darkness.</p>
<p>‘Twas then that I saw shadows growing upon the horizon we shared.</p>
<p>Ours is a society bent on war upon the Nafílim.  No matter how studious and wise one may be, no matter how deft and marvellous with the sword, to be empty of odyl was to be empty of promise.</p>
<p>How dearly I believed that Rolf would’ve made it all work out somehow.  That he would’ve been able to defend his honour.  That he would’ve made due and more with his ill-starred lot.  For a wunderkind like him, it surely could’ve been so.  That is, were he graced with even the faintest sliver of odyl.</p>
<p>But he wasn’t.</p>
<p>He had <i>naught.</i></p>
<p>None… none at all.</p>
<p>And without it, he was but fodder to be cast to the Nafílim.</p>
<p>Magick can be overcome only by greater magicks, whether in offence or defence.  For Rolf, this was a forgone conclusion.  He could not attack.  He could not defend.  He could not know victory when it matters most.  He could not thwart defeat even if it spelt his own end.</p>
<p>Odyl is, to begin with, a blessing endowed to each kin of Man by Yoná, our Deiva Most Divine.  ‘Twas through the holy Revelation shown to St. Rakliammelech that he conceived the Roun of Orisons: rites by which to commune with the Deiva, then disseminated to all spheres of Man.  From Her is gifted the grace of odyl, and there is not a soul that She has turned away.</p>
<p>Just as a child would be given flesh and blood from mother and father both, so, too, should we lambs of Yoná receive from Her our odyl.</p>
<p>How rooted in certainty this was.</p>
<p>But Rolf was as a fledgling of a different nest.  An apple fallen too errantly from our tree.  The black sheep of the herd, abandoned even by Yoná, our one shepherd.</p>
<p>We Londosians are ever bound to our odyl.  Its measure is our worth.  And so for someone like Rolf to be void of it, naught but ill and disdain awaited him.</p>
<p>Rolf Buckmann.  Not a prodigy, but half a man.  Not a model for us all, but a “defect”, through and through.  This was what Londosius had deemed of him.  Adamantly, no less, as though ‘twere the sacrosanct word of Yoná Herself.</p>
<p>And that was why Rolf was disavowed by House Buckmann.  Why the ink was washed away from our deeds of betrothal.  Parchment, now full-white as they were the day they were bleached.</p>
<p>But in the face of such misfortune was I, accorded a lot most can only dream of.</p>
<p>Attaining the highest distinction of “Aureola” from the Roun of Orisons, I enlisted into the 5th Chivalric Order to great fanfare, for it happened that, of all the uncountable knights and dames to have ever joined its halls, I was foremost in my store of odyl.</p>
<p>By that alone, the powers that be made me not a swain in my first year, but a dame, knighted with all haste and ceremony.  Yet their indulgence seemed unending, as I was then made to stand amidst their high echelon: a member of the leadership, one under the direct command of the mareschal in his personal unit.</p>
<p>Breathless as I was, the fates were keen to toy with our fortunes ever more.  Yes…  How appalled I was to find Rolf as a swain to none other than myself.</p>
<p>‘Tis expected—and indeed, the usual course of things—that a recruit of the Order must first endure the toils of swainhood.  But for Rolf himself to be made mine?  No less a fledgling in my own right, vacuous of the office of a dame?</p>
<p>I sensed then, and now, some foul hand at work in all of this.  Was there some humour to be found?  A savoury note in this bitter irony?  To so make a “defect” a swain to his former betrothed?  I could not know, but I feared there were many who did and indulged in it just the same.</p>
<p>And thus did I know sorrow.</p>
<p>To see Rolf, burly and proud of figure as he was, pitifully hunched over as he tended to my armour.</p>
<p>To see the prodigy, gentle and full of promise, left to such drudgery as tugging my horse along on foot.</p>
<p>To be addressed by my once-betrothed with all deference, but cold of the warmth of our more innocent days.</p>
<p>I made sure to give him the freedom to speak to me as he always had.  Only, to him, ‘twas a liberty too fraught.  I realised then, that somewhere in the course of this whirlwind, we were separated.  Farther from each other now than ever in our lives.</p>
<p>And yet… I also knew happiness.</p>
<p>Happiness in being yet by his side.</p>
<p>Our prospects for marriage may have been undone, but my feelings?  Nay.  I still very well wished for a life spent together with him.  Dearly and more dearly again, no less than before.</p>
<p>Because to be with him was as to breathe.  The wheeling of the sun, the blowing of the winds, the coursing of the riversーthese were, to me, no less natural than Rolf’s company.</p>
<p>‘Twas so, then, that beside Rolf Buckmann was where I belonged.</p>
<p>I, Emilie Mernesse.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Within a year of my enlistment, I was made lieutenant to the Owlcranes.</p>
<p>And not long before did Felicia herself join us in the 5th.</p>
<p>Hers was a fate most contrary to her brother’s, for at her own rites did Felicia receive a ponderous store of odyl.  So much so that she was considered for a seat in the Sorcery Brigade’s leadership.</p>
<p>But she was no less astounded than I, upon seeing for herself the ill treatment exacted upon Rolf.  Astounded, and disheartened.</p>
<p>For his part, Rolf was yet a swain.  Though in spite of his hardships, he never faltered in his training: his swordplay was as sharp as ever.  But to the members of an institution so steeped in the practice of magicks, there was, at least, some measure of contempt for pure swordsmanship.  Nonetheless, ‘twas this art that Rolf continued to ply with great assiduousness.</p>
<p>He was, most apparently by this time, of a physique most imposing in the entirety of the 5th’s ranks, with strength of arms matched by none else.  In spite of it, the others—all of them, really—were quick to disparage his usefulness against the Nafílim.  But ‘twas during physical training with him that they were quieted to some degree.</p>
<p>Though that changed most asudden whenever he faced any of our leaders, for ‘twas they who were donned with silver armour, wonders of odyllic conduction that they were.  Try as he might, never could Rolf reach them with his sword, and without odyl of his own to defend with, the sparring matches were ever cruel and one-sided travesties.</p>
<p>Of course, it never occurred to those leaders to contend on equal grounds.  Their silver arms and armour stayed on at all times, as they were taught to do by both instruction and the rigours of the battlefield.  And so to keep the gear on was, in and of itself, a form of training.  Sportsmanship, then, was to them a poor excuse to take it all off.</p>
<p>But just the same, practicality was their own ill excuse, to beat and deride Rolf as they pleased, all from the security of their argent raiments.  The grins roused upon their lips was proof enough of their sadism.</p>
<p>That’s not to say Rolf went the entire way without some respect paid to his skill.  There were those that acknowledged him, surely, but they were as droplets in a sea ever roiling with disdain for him.</p>
<p>I recall a day when I was yet a lieutenant.</p>
<p>A day that saw Rolf grievously injured by a spell during what should’ve been mere sword practice.  From what I’d heard, the offender was overwhelmed by Rolf’s strength, and on the verge of defeat, resorted to magick to turn the tables.</p>
<p>That same opponent was none other than a member of the Sorcery Brigade, joining sword practice on some whim.  The blade was naturally not his forte, but the thought of losing to a “defect” was evidently more than his pride could handle.</p>
<p>Apprised of what’d happened, I raced to the infirmary at once.</p>
<p>“Rolf!  Oh, the wounds…!  Are you all right!?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I am.”</p>
<p>An unhurried, unbroken answer from Rolf, reclined as he was upon a bed, dressed in head to toe with bandages.  Mottling them was blood, freshly red.</p>
<p>My worries unabated, I pressed the physician nearby for answers.</p>
<p>“Sir, his injuries—how do they fare?”</p>
<p>“Well, let’s see then,” he responded methodically.  “Multiple lesions he’s had, and internal haemorrhaging to boot.  Took a while of mending magicks to patch him up, but the wounds should be nicely sealed now.  I shouldn’t expect any sequelae to harry him henceforth.”</p>
<p>Hearing those words was a relief.  Though what the physician uttered next stoked my ire.</p>
<p>“Though truth be told, this sort of thing could’ve been easily avoided, even with the most basic of palings.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Why, sir,” I returned, unaware of the sharpened quietness of my voice.  “‘Tis his fault,  you mean to say?”</p>
<p>“Not my place <i>to</i> say, of faults.  I don the doctor’s coat, after all,” the physician countered.  “And as per my station, I say this: treatments do not come cheap, you should know.”</p>
<p>A response that earned my irritation many times over.  Yet I hadn’t the patience to humour him further.</p>
<p>“Your opponent,” I said, having turned back to Rolf.  “What madness was in him!?  To spit out magicks in a sword spar!  His superiors should hear of this!”</p>
<p>With that, I very well had a mind to burst out of the infirmary and protest against the incident to the other leaders.  But I was stayed by Rolf’s curt words, delivered as he did nothing but stare at the ceiling.</p>
<p>“It’s useless.”</p>
<p>“Wh—!  Why’s that!?”</p>
<p>“They’re not the sort to lend an ear.  Not to trifles such as this.”</p>
<p>Never did Rolf do aught but quietly suffer the injustices dealt upon him.  Not even when he was injured so.  Whatever grievances he may have nurtured, never were they aired.</p>
<p>That stolidness of his racked me horribly.</p>
<p>“No.  They <i>shall,”</i> I replied with spirit.  “This won’t stand, Rolf.  I’m going!”</p>
<p>True to my word, I flew out of the infirmary and alighted upon the offices of the Sorcery Brigade.  ‘Twas there that I found the lieutenant and superior of Rolf’s opponent, to whom I complained fiercely.  And ‘twas there that I knew the meaning of Rolf’s words.</p>
<p>“Had your swain the odyl to resist it, surely he would not have suffered what he did.”  An echo of the physician’s own insolence, aired with hollow interest.  “The problem, then, lies with him, does it not?”</p>
<p>I struck his desk.  “Enough of your nonsense!!”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Lieutenant Mernesse,” he sighed, “I mean all the respect in the world, I do.  But to sink our standards for the comfort of a ‘defect’ is, itself, nonsense.  Injurious to our Order, even.  Pray understand, my Lady.”</p>
<p>We were of like rank, he and I.  But seeing as I was of the Owlcranes, perhaps this lieutenant felt compelled to pay deference to me.  Though he certainly hid none of his prejudice for Rolf.  Not in the slightest.</p>
<p><i>“Tch…!”</i></p>
<p>By then, I’d lost all patience.</p>
<p>Heated, I went to the Mareschal Tallien himself and broached the very same matter, only to be met with the very same complacence.  The same apathy.  The same hatred.</p>
<p>A sentiment shared by all in the Order—nay, in all of Londosius, for a man who lacked only in odyl.</p>
<p>Rolf spoke not a word against it.</p>
<p>And I could do naught but accept it.</p>
<p>How it pained me so.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Another memory, then.</p>
<p>Here, too, was I lieutenant to the Owlcranes.</p>
<p>A time haunting even to this day.</p>
<p>Rolf and I were to spar one another.  Not by choice, but by an order from the Mareschal Tallien himself, to—in his own words—”hammer my swain into shape.”  Emphatically did I insist upon at least doing so with the same equipment as Rolf’s, but like the many leaders below him, the mareschal brooked none of my words.</p>
<p>I wonder.</p>
<p>What look was upon my face?</p>
<p>As Rolf and I measured swords?</p>
<p>As iron and silver coursed against one another?</p>
<p>A paling, unseen to the eye, breathed from my armour to inwreathe every seam and length of my body.  And ‘twas this paling that dammed the force of Rolf’s sword.  No matter where he aimed, no matter how quickly or strongly he swung, not once did his blade reach my person.</p>
<p>A denial most absolute.</p>
<p>He who is unmagicked cannot defeat one who so is.</p>
<p>Just as one added to one becomes two.  Whether calculated a hundred times over or a million, the outcome remains the same.  ‘Twas so, then, that Rolf’s blade was stayed by the paling.  Absolute indeed, as if the hand of Yoná Herself were there to stop it.</p>
<p>And ‘twas not for a lack of trying.  In Rolf’s grip, the iron sword flowed scythingly.  With more quickness than the senses could follow would his blade race to my vitalsーaccurately so, as if driven there by the gales of his will.</p>
<p>Only to be stilled no further than a hair’s width before its mark.</p>
<p>But of my own blade, the story couldn’t have been more different.</p>
<p>None were the times that it landed where ‘twas aimed.  And yet all about Rolf’s body were injuries, accruing more and more.  Where he evaded, the odyllic stream would find him and tear away at his flesh.  Where he defended, the odyllic blast would strike him and lay low his body into the ground.</p>
<p>However one-sided it may have been, the mareschal was loath to end the match, let alone mitigate it—not while Rolf and I yet stood.  ‘Twas more a farce than a spar, and to my great dismay, one prolonged beyond all reason.</p>
<p>But never did Rolf let up.  His were movements of daunting precision, ever minimising the severity of the wounds inflicted upon him.  His was a mind of steeled focus, keeping him always on his feet.  Though his sword was humbled with every swing, never reaching me in its unseeable career, Rolf fought on.</p>
<p>On, and on, and on.  For as long as his body yet had the strength to move.</p>
<p>And ‘twas never in him to play at frailty and willfully couch in defeat.  Always did he accept derision and scorn from others, but the moment a sword was put in his hands, Rolf was a man transformed.  An avatar unrelenting, defiant of aught and all set against him.</p>
<p>How it broke my heart.</p>
<p>To see him yet afoot, bruised and thrashed, bloodied to great waste, whilst I suffered not a graze upon my skin, to say nothing of the untouched silver reams of my armour.</p>
<p>Ever was he our paragon.</p>
<p>Strong, more so than anyone.  Dependable, more so than solid ground.</p>
<p>How I long dreamt of standing shoulder-to-shoulder with him in our fight against the Nafílim.  A dream I thought was within reach, so long as I applied myself, that I may keep up with him.</p>
<p>Why was it, then?</p>
<p>That we were so fraught as we were?</p>
<p>That Rolf had become so pitiable a man?</p>
<p>Further and further still our spar went, till Rolf lost all consciousness and foundered into the dirt.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>My third year with the Order.</p>
<p>‘Twas then that I was made one of its high commanders: Emilie Mernesse, newly appointed Dame Mareschal of the 5th.</p>
<p>The reasons were as simple as they were sudden: Bartt Tallien, my predecessor, and the under-mareschal both retired to their respective provinces to assume mastership of their estates.  All whilst my deeds at the Battle of Erbelde were given no small recognition.</p>
<p>To great exaggeration in truth, for I very well knew that Rolf’s own merits towered by comparison.  Even then, turned to those same merits were naught but blind eyes.</p>
<p>And though ‘tis certain that the 5th’s leaders come and go as quickly as the seasons pass, ‘twas something of a miracle, to be given the mareschal’s cape not more than three years into one’s stay at the Order.</p>
<p>But ‘twas no less exceptional for a swain to remain so three years into his own tenure.  That’s right—Rolf was yet my swain, my housecleaner, my hostler, my armourer… my servant.  All was as when he first enlisted.</p>
<p>Whilst for her part, Felicia was made brigadier at the same time.  Her ascent, too, was no less astounding in its speed.</p>
<p>But as their stations differed more and more, so too did Felicia’s view of her brother muddy with disillusionment.  Since the dawn of their lives, Rolf was ever the focus of his dear sister’s unquestioning admiration.  Little wonder, then, as to why Felicia found it a Sisyphean task to accept her brother’s lot.</p>
<p>‘Twas heartwrenching, to look on as their sibling bond ailed like it did.  Heartwrenching again, to be of no avail to them in the slightest.  Even as mareschal.  Even as their most intimate peer for all of their lives.</p>
<p>I very well did what I could to free Rolf from the yoke of swainhood.  To be granted a knightly accolade was a surefire way, and ‘twas in my power as mareschal to nominate him for that exact honour.  The Marquis Norden gathered such requests not less than twice a year—opportunities that I seized with great proaction.</p>
<p>Our foul fortune, then, that each and every time, Rolf’s was the lone nomination to bear no fruit.  The Marquis seemed adamant in his scorn for the ungraced, and so by his cold heart was Rolf made to remain my swain.</p>
<p>Of course, status was but one avenue to afford him the respect that he deserved.  As mareschal, I was vested with authority over human resources in the 5th.  Thus was it always in the back of my mind to perhaps make Rolf a swain to another knight.</p>
<p>But in the end, ‘twas a fancy never acted upon.  By that time, I’d grown somewhat adept at suppressing my more… <i>unsightly</i> feelings.</p>
<p>Those of… no longer wanting to see Rolf tend to my horse.</p>
<p>Of pitying my once-betrothed, whose hands, once destined for gallantry, seemed of late more acquainted with steed-reins than a sword grip.</p>
<p>Though perhaps the choice was long since lost.  After all, no mareschal would be suffered were hers an authority exercised for her own interests.  And ‘twas a fact that the Orders were fervent in their observance of hierarchies.  To blatantly ignore the status quo and move personnel about as I pleased was to betray the expectations of my office.</p>
<p>Hence did I surrender the thought.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Upon a day of that same year, I’d brought back a reconnaissance report to my chambers, and there, skimmed through its contents as per usual.</p>
<p>Our patrollers here at the 5th follow a certain protocol.  Any region subject to their watch would be divided into a number of areas, and the hostiles discovered therein would be tallied—be they Nafílim, behemót, and the like.  The results are next juxtaposed to past observations, and through some arithmetics, what we’d coined the “threat level” for the region would then be calculated and any notable trends recorded.</p>
<p>This was hardly fruitless ado, for it very well served to guide where we might more effectively allocate our resources.  ‘Twas none other than Rolf himself who devised it all in the year prior, and I who brought it to Tallien’s desk when he was yet mareschal.  Then, too, did I insist that ‘twas all of Rolf’s design, but Tallien’s were not ears receptive to praises for a man ungraced.</p>
<p>As for the report itself—upon one of its sections did my eyes linger.  If the patrollers saw true and the calculations were sound, then ‘twas certain: over the last few moons, the threat levels at Mt. Godrika had been waning.  And markedly so, at that.</p>
<p>A mountain, hiding in its bowels whole monoliths of silver ore.  Or more a haunted lair, for whilst Londosius once called the place its own long ago, the mountain and the tunnels beneath it soon became the stamping grounds of the behemót.  But as with all things, this, too, changed.</p>
<p>Behemót themselves are as varied of forms as they are fickle in their migrations.  And like their more mundane counterparts, they are prone to interspecies conflict, whether for territory or sustenance.  All this can culminate in rather sudden fluctuations in their disparate populations.</p>
<p>Possible, then, that the thinning of their numbers at Godrika was but a part of this temporary pattern.  Possible again was the arisen prospect of cleaning them out altogether.  Were we to strike while the iron is hot, Godrika would be ours again.  And then, into the eager armouries of Londosius would go its mounds and mounds of silver.</p>
<p>I thought then—strongly, albeit naïvely—that this must needs be acted upon.</p>
<p>Inspired, thereafter did I summon the leaders of the 5th and broached to them a plan to recapture the Godrika Minery.  The waning threats within the region, the opportunity newly unveiled—all was related to much detail.  And once their ears had their fill of my vouching, the leaders’ enthusiasm was unanimous.</p>
<p>Untold prestige would be bestowed to the 5th, were we to succeed.</p>
<p>This, we all believed.</p>
<p>This, we were all taken with.</p>
<p>We were of the 5th, after all.  For &#8217;tis by Londosius’ own decree that the Orders are numbered as befits their strength, with the 1st being the most capable by far—to say nothing of its mareschal, in her own right a sword unmatched in all the kingdom itself.</p>
<p>And what of the 5th?  The bottom of the barrel, to put it one way, where gathered the coddled issue of the aristocracy, there only to idle their days away till brighter prospects fell upon their laps.</p>
<p>And fall one did, to <i>all</i> of our laps: Godrika.  Recapture its depths, and our wayward lot might attain distinction far greater than any of the other Orders’ ever had in the last few years.  How fevered we were then, goaded by dreams of medals, decorations, and titles, as we worked to bring it all to fruition.</p>
<p>Almost a month of preparations followed, riddled with meetings with the leadership.  We sent scouts to peer through Mt. Godrika with a fine-toothed comb, to reassess the behemót’s numbers to greater accuracy.  Then did we rally the brigades, brief them on their duties, and establish a chain of command specific to the operation.</p>
<p>Forming the rest of the plans was a charge I was keen to shoulder alone.  Whether it be devising the logistics, charting out our marching path, selecting the ideal location to erect our camp, all and much more I sleeplessly handled over those few weeks.</p>
<p>By the end of it, I was sapped and wearied.  But the plans were, at last, complete—perfect, even—and drawn to my wholehearted satisfaction.  How long had it been since I’d last felt such fulfilment?</p>
<p>I wasn’t alone in the effort.  The leaders, too, were spent, but no less aglow with pride in their work and excitement for all that was to come.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Again was I sat at my desk, thumbing through papers of a different purpose: the operation plans, full-writ to the tiniest detail.  My magnum opus, one could say.  Just looking upon it warmed my face to a smile.  ‘Twas then that I broached to Rolf of it, who stood nearby, busied with cleaning.</p>
<p>“Rolf, we’ve drawn up plans for the next operation.  Come and have a look, if you can?”</p>
<p>“Plans, my Lady?”  Rolf turned to me, and then to the papers I held to him.  “Classified materials—are you certain?”</p>
<p>“I am.”</p>
<p>His doubt was warranted.  To willfully draw the eyes of a swain to the plans of an operation—upon the eve of its announcement, of all times—no doubt breached many protocols.</p>
<p>But I could scarce help myself.  Dearly did I wish for Rolf to see it: the first set of plans drawn by my quill since assuming the post of mareschal.  An operation produced from mountainous toil, to be executed on a scale hitherto unseen.  And perhaps… I wanted to see the look of surprise on Rolf’s face once again.  For ‘twas certain: I count in years since last I saw any brightness upon his mien.</p>
<p>The shuffling of paper.  The quietude of his perusing gaze.  In that eternal moment, my heart raced.</p>
<p>But when words most unexpected parted from his lips, I very well felt my own face turn to stone.</p>
<p>“My Lady,” he said at last, looking up from the papers.  “I believe these plans are in need of some reassessments.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Reassessments?”  My heart stopped.  “Where, exactly?”</p>
<p>“‘Where’, might not be the word.  If I may be blunt, this operation’s actionability itself must needs be reexamined.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;What?  How can you say that!?”  The disbelief almost left me breathless.  ‘Twas indeed blunt of him, to put it lightly.  “Rolf, need I remind you of all that our kingdom stands to gain should we capture these mines?”</p>
<p>“We would gain much, true, but I believe that there loom losses greater again.  Godrika offers us only silver, my Lady—nothing else.”</p>
<p>“I’m fully aware.  But ‘tis the sheer bounty of the silver itself that is more the point, Rolf!”</p>
<p>“Silver is a resource most precious to our military pillars, my Lady, one that our kingdom forbids the export of.  All that we extract from Godrika goes into meeting the demands of the war effort.  Put simply, we stock our store of silver and our armies shall swell along with it.”</p>
<p>Rolf spoke right.</p>
<p>Were we to avail ourselves with all the silver Godrika had to offer, ‘twas very likely that not a single knight in any of the Orders would go unfitted with argent gear.  But that was hardly a prospect to dread.</p>
<p>“Listen, Rolf.  Suppose for a moment we capture Godrika, and put silver arms and armour into the hands of all of our officers.  You must know just how tremendous of an advantage that avails us in our fight against the Nafílim?”</p>
<p>Such an obvious matter this was.  That Rolf himself seemed dimmed to it sparked some irritation in me.</p>
<p>‘Twas by no means a swain’s office to consider things well beyond his grasp, and from them make decisions more sweeping than he can imagine.  Yet that was hardly what I expected from him at the moment.  I strove to much exhaustion to see this through.  Could he not see that, at least?</p>
<p>“Think of all the comrades-in-arms we can save!” I went on.  “And our families!  Our loved ones!  But more than anything, it brings us so much closer to ending the Nafílim once and for all.”</p>
<p>“Nay, my Lady.  Godrika only portends a greater need of gravestones for our comrades.”</p>
<p>“And why’s that!?”</p>
<p>“The battles we bear at present are plenty enough, yet Central seeks to stretch the lines of each of these battlefields all the more.  The burdens upon them will weigh heavily and heavier still should we arm and sharpen ourselves further—burdens Central is overeager to heave upon us.”</p>
<p>“Burden?  The only burden I see is the one upon your shoulders!  Proof, Rolf!  Have you any at all?  That Central would be so insatiable!?”</p>
<p>“None, my Lady.”</p>
<p>“Then why speak against it so!?”</p>
<p>Before I knew it, my voice had grown hoarse.</p>
<p>How long ago was it that I began sharing in Felicia’s feelings?  Of being frustrated with Rolf?  With his plight?  His conduct?  Perhaps much further back than I’d like to admit.  Only, the whole time, I was wont to blind myself from it.</p>
<p>A riling annoyance, once bottled up, but now ready to burst into the fore.  This, I felt.  And yet, there Rolf was, unmoved by it as he continued on.</p>
<p>“Furthermore, I cannot see the need to bring an end to all Nafílim.”</p>
<p>“Rolf…!?”</p>
<p>An utterance I wished were an illusion upon my ears.</p>
<p>Ours are days filled with battles.  Ours: the good people of the good realm of Londosius.</p>
<p>And for what?</p>
<p>Peace for all of Man.</p>
<p>Surety for all our futures.</p>
<p>Both and more forever slips from our grasp, so long as the Nafílim are left unextinguished.  ‘Tis grave folly to deny it.</p>
<p>Was it, then, that in the course of too many days of too much grief, and surrendering himself to meekness and servility, that Rolf began to look where the rest of us dared not?</p>
<p>“My Lady, it betrays reason to expect that we may ever bring about the extinction of any kind.”</p>
<p>“‘Tis precisely why we toil away in our duties, is it not!?  That we might usher in some chance to an impossibility?  Rolf, we have momentum in this war!  Were we to stay the path at all costs, then surely the day would come!  The day when the war is done at last—and the Nafílim along with it!”</p>
<p>“‘Tis naught but a path of pure carnage you would have us walk, my Lady.”</p>
<p>“You speak nonsense, Rolf!”</p>
<p>By now, I was forgetting myself.  My head was aboil.  For never could I have imagined that Rolf, of all people, would so spurn our reason to fight.</p>
<p>‘Tis true that he himself faced no meagre spurning.  Yoná had denied him of his due.  Of Her grace, of the odyl we all hold so dear.  And its lacking was as a mark of sin upon his head, there to rouse groundless enmity from any lamb of Yoná that might spy it and know its meaning.</p>
<p>Still, ‘twouldn’t do for anyone, even for one as misfortuned as Rolf, to be derelict in this holy battle against the Wicked.  What good does it do him, to be so cowed?  To give up fighting in the name of our Deiva for want of Her love?  He is born a kin of Man.  And so must he fight for those he holds dear, for all his fellow Men, and for the world itself.</p>
<p>So simple and pure a truth this was.  Yet, why couldn’t Rolf, in all of his wisdom, understand it?</p>
<p>“Moreover,” he spoke again, “I cannot abet the soundness of this operation, if it executes on grounds that the threat within the mines is thinned.”</p>
<p>“Threat?  <i>Threat,</i> Rolf?  ‘Twas none other than you who came up with the calculations for measuring such threats!”</p>
<p>Verily.  ‘Twas his own counsel that birthed it.  Ironic, then, that it played so vital a role in bringing to fruition an operation he so opposed.</p>
<p>“I believe the behemót may have vacated themselves rather too asudden.  Why this came to be bears much needed consideration and scrutiny,” Rolf explained.</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I mean that, as an example, a menace of a behemá may have made itself home in the mines, and by its ruthless nature, has been weeding out its weaker kin.”</p>
<p>“What’s this?  A ‘menace of a behemá’, you say?  Your fancies have taken a flight too far, Rolf!”</p>
<p>“Perhaps they have, my Lady.  Perhaps there is no such specimen.  But just as well, it simply may be that our scouts have not discovered it as of yet.”</p>
<p>Not a step would Rolf yield in this matter.  That much was clear to me by then.  And so did I take a deep breath, to soothe my quivering veins.</p>
<p>“Rolf,” I began anew, “I understand well that your place here may become all the more perilous should we avail our armouries with more silver.  But I’m the mareschal of this Order now.  Much injury and injustice it has done you, I know.  Yet with me as its commander, I’ll make certain that you’ll not be ailed by such abuse any longer.”</p>
<p>With my eyes locked squarely upon Rolf, I delivered those very words.</p>
<p>With a wish that this sincerest thought of mine might be conveyed to him, I delivered the following.</p>
<p>“I am ever and always your ally, Rolf.  But just as I would give my all for you, I need you to do the same for me—to think upon yourself, of what it means to be a knight, of why we fight with so much desperation.  Won’t you do this for me?”</p>
<p>Were even our greenest knights to be donned with silver gear, no longer would Rolf know victory, not even in sword practice where he dominated so.  This ill prospect hardly escaped me.  But hardly again could I, mareschal to this Order, abort this operation, just to secure what precarious standing Rolf had in these halls.</p>
<p><i>‘I would give my all for you.’</i></p>
<p>With no frail will had I uttered those words.  The operation must go on, but in return, ‘twas my full intent to do all I could to mitigate the abuses trained upon Rolf.</p>
<p>My most intimate resolve, one that Rolf seemingly disregarded with his next words.</p>
<p>“Even still, my Lady.  I am opposed to this operation.”</p>
<p>A chill through the body.</p>
<p>A freezing of the blood.</p>
<p>A sapping of the humours.  Felt then.  Remembered, even now.</p>
<p>Thereafter did I take another deep breath, and with all emotion killed from my heart and timbre both, I spoke again.</p>
<p>“Rolf.  This is what the Order itself has decided upon.  Such strategic matters shall neither heed nor abide dissent from a mere swain.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;My apologies, Mareschal.”</p>
<p>Thus did Rolf return to his chores.</p>
<p>Thus did I lean back heavily into my chair.</p>
<p>A richly leathern chair, made to complement a grand desk of mahogany wood.</p>
<p>How frigid it felt against my skin, that leather.</p>
<p>And how distant I felt from Rolf.  Though we were right in the same room.  Though he was right beside me, doing his duty of housecleaning.</p>
<p>Oh, how I wanted to run away from it all.</p>
<p>But left with nowhere, I merely shut them from my sight.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>The operation was a success.</p>
<p>Godrika was retaken.</p>
<p>And yet, the spirit of cheer found no home in me.  For just as Rolf had prevised, there indeed lurked in that subterrane a behemá more savage than our imagining.</p>
<p>Our eagerness stirred the monster below: a catoblepas, dread fiend of myth, one that tore through the 5th’s ranks in their frantic escape.  ‘Twas a folly that exacted from us a price too heavy to bear: droves upon droves of our number, dead.</p>
<p>And none deserved the blame more than I.  To Rolf’s counsel did I turn my back, only to then face the families of the lost.  To condole them.  To answer for my indiscretion.</p>
<p>And how ironic again, that ‘twas not our knights that had slain the catoblepas, but Rolf himself.  And only himself.  Where my levinblade and all of our magicks failed, Rolf’s wits and daring succeeded.</p>
<p>Yet for however dear and vain our sacrifices were, the prestige accorded to the 5th was unmistakable.  A ceremony followed, wherein medals were bestowed to the participant leaders, as well as the knights distinguished in their feats.</p>
<p>I had the honour of officiating the solemn affair, but not the honour of giving Rolf his rightful due.  For ‘twas not vested in me to decide who earned what, but in the Marquis Norden himself.  Verily had I nominated Rolf, but in the end, he was a hero left unsung.</p>
<p>‘Twas perhaps something we both expected.  Hardly a sigh issued from our lips.</p>
<p>“Rolf…  I’m sorry,” I had said to him.  “I made especially sure to bid the marquis you be honoured, but… I’m afraid he…”</p>
<p>“Pay it no mind, Mareschal.”</p>
<p>That was his answer.  And all he ever said of it.</p>
<p>A man ever trudging up the Sisyphean hill to knighthood.  But never a man to despair at every tumble he took to the bottom.</p>
<p>A man by the name of “Rolf Buckmann”.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>A scant two years from Godrika, and the myriad ranks of the Orders were each and all fitted with silver.  Even the swains themselves were bedight with the argent, for it happened that Godrika hid veins of it far more bountiful than any could’ve foreseen.</p>
<p>Ironic, then, that what I <i>had</i> foreseen was soon realised: Rolf no longer knew the taste of victory, silvered as his sparring partners now were.  Hence did I exempt him from all requisite training.  There was little meaning in them if what awaited him were naught but injury and derision.</p>
<p>But that hardly stopped him.</p>
<p>On and on did he brandish his sword, its blade never reaching its mark.</p>
<p>On and on was he beaten down into the ground, left with naught to do but writhe and gasp for air.</p>
<p>Gone were the scant inklings of awe for his prowess.  To all the others, he was a rag doll to be torn and broken day after day.</p>
<p>And not just a rag doll, but a blotch of iron in an ocean of silver.  True, swains were themselves also afforded the shimmering gear, but Rolf was an exception: in the entirety of the 5th, he was the only one left unfitted.  This, too, was a development beyond my wildest dreams.</p>
<p>More astonishing was the influence of silver on the minds of the officers themselves.  Their argent gear: effective in battle, splendid to behold, and now, a status symbol of no small degree.  Parading about in their newly given shine had fattened their conceit to the fullest.  And along with it, their scorn for the yet iron-clad Rolf.</p>
<p>Apprised of the situation, I ordered the quartermaster to also have made for Rolf a suit of silver armour to call his own.</p>
<p>“Madame, I’m afraid I fail to see the point in this,” the quartermaster tilted his head.  “What purpose might silver serve a man of no odyl?”</p>
<p>“I would have the whole of the 5th be in full lockstep, a purpose silver should serve well enough,” I answered firmly.  “Deprive him of it and we but mark him the black sheep of our herd, do we not?”</p>
<p>There was no lie in what I’d said.  My reasoning should’ve proven sound enough.  Even then, the quartermaster was oddly given to resistance.</p>
<p>“Pardon me, madame, but is it not the hobbling sheep of a man himself that keeps our herd <i>out</i> of lockstep?”</p>
<p>“Just do as I’ve requested, will you now?  A suit of silver armour for Rolf, <i>please</i> and thank you.”</p>
<p>Words of my own, spoken by my own, then echoed up in me.</p>
<p><i>‘&#8230;I’ll make certain that you’ll not be ailed by such abuse any longer…’</i></p>
<p>A promise I’d made to Rolf.  A promise I meant not to betray.</p>
<p>“I fear I’ve not the final say in this, madame,” on did the quartermaster resist.  “Silver equipment was once the privilege of the executive officers, accorded only by Central itself.  Theirs is an authority that stands, even now.  To receive any at all, I must needs first inform Central of the number we require, and thereafter gain their approval.”</p>
<p>“Then why not do just that?  Tell Central to include a set for Rolf in the next shipment.  Is that so difficult?”</p>
<p>“My Mareschal.  It bears no mention that silver is soft amongst the many metals.  Have an odylless soldier wear it, and he might as well wear paper.”  A sigh.  “With all due respect, could you, with clear conscience, so poorly outfit one of your own, just that he might match more merrily with his peers?  By my measure, you but imperil this man, good-for-nothing that he is.”</p>
<p>Had this officer omitted that last remark, I might’ve thought him half-considerate of Rolf.  But in them was laid bare the way of his heart: he believed Rolf to be most undeserving of silver gear, magnificent of power and beauty as ‘twas in his mind.</p>
<p>“&#8230;I’ll hear no further excuses.  Get Rolf his share.  Do all that you must.”</p>
<p>A conversation severed by my own irritation.  That same ire further harshened my steps as I quit the quartermaster’s presence.  Yet ‘twas the sullen truth that no consent would come from Central.</p>
<p>There was no avail in sight for Rolf.  How nagging, how unendurable ‘twas.</p>
<p>And so tugging my horse along now was the same man, of the same towering physique, clad in the same iron.  A man that sooner seemed a manservant than a swain.</p>
<p>By that point, there were indeed those that’d begun to treat Rolf as such.  What was once “abuse” was now flagrant persecution.</p>
<p>I made a point to request again a suit of silver for Rolf during a summons to the royal capital.  But there in Redelberne was I met with the same excuses as the quartermaster’s.  There, my hopes were dashed yet again.</p>
<p>The officials observed anew that a suit made to match Rolf’s large figure would require a custom fit.  Reasonable, if not for the tone of scorn laced in their timbre.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>The bitter winds sent against Rolf only crescendoed from there on.</p>
<p>But I did not stand idly by; with quill set to parchment, I decreed to the whole of the 5th that all members strike from their conscience any discriminatory misgivings for another, based whether on capability or equipment.  Though in the end, like so many of my prior efforts to shield Rolf, it amounted to naught.</p>
<p>In the course of those heavy days, an incident unfolded: a horse of mine had gone missing from the stables.</p>
<p>The leadership boiled with panick: the steed was a gift from none other than His Majesty, King Londosius.  As my swain, ‘twas Rolf’s duty to look after the horseーa responsibility hardly forgotten by the leadership, for they all then pounced upon him, so eager to lay the blame upon a lapse of his wits.</p>
<p>Some secret malice was at work, a design to set the horse loose and brand Rolf the culprit—a design to have him expelled.  I found it hard to believe that the very Order I commanded could be so insidious, yet the suspicion remained a ghost haunting my thoughts.  Nevertheless, nary a spot of proof was ever brought to light that could substantiate those doubts.</p>
<p>I quickly attempted to calm the situation, but the effort was more quickly again washed away, for Rolf’s ensuing defiance was as salt upon the leaders’ angered blister.  And yet, for however much he refuted the accusations brought against him, ‘twas a dark curiosity that Rolf couldn’t explain his activities in town, taken on the very same day of the horse’s vanishing—all on account of insobriety.</p>
<p>When pressed, he but pursed his lips shut like a child loath to admit to the virtues of the apology.</p>
<p>Were he more of himself of our bygone days, surely Rolf would’ve confessed to his ill actions and made proper amends.  But he was changed.  The long years of discrimination seemed to have left him thoroughly sallowed.</p>
<p>Of course, I grieved for his situation.  His pain, his troubles, all were suffered unjustly.  Yet I also couldn’t bear the thought that he could be so changed, so withered of his former valour.  Thus, to much of my own grief was I dashed by his sunken conduct.</p>
<p>‘Twas the truth that a single horse was all that was lost.  A slight against His Majesty, to neglect his royal gift, sure.  But ‘twas not as though I or the Order saw a heavy sin upon Rolf’s head.  No, that head of his was yet steeled against the temptations of spite and treachery, that much I knew.  ‘Twas but an innocent slip of his hands that freed the horse, no doubt, were the fault truly his.</p>
<p>Indeed… a simple mistake.  One that could’ve been settled just as simply.</p>
<p>An apology.</p>
<p>With but a single word, he could’ve earned my immediate forgiveness.</p>
<p>With but a single utterance, this commotion could’ve met its swift end.</p>
<p>And yet, Rolf refused.</p>
<p>‘Twas in parallel that the matter of my betrothal to Kenneth of Albeck was given speed.  A development that clouded my spirits and had me weary of any hope for the future.</p>
<p>Set against those troubles was this tangled knot of a scandal, doomed to be left no less coiled.</p>
<p>I saw no other choice—I had Rolf exiled.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Why did it come to this?</p>
<p>Why didn’t Rolf have it in him to apologise?</p>
<p>Oh, the countless times I asked myself so.  In the following days of processing his expulsion.  In the following days of listening to gleeful lips sing of his punishments.  At their end, my heart knew no answer.</p>
<p>When it finally came time for him to leave, I had set out to meet him.  However small, there was yet hope.  Hope that he might have some words.  Hope that he might see the worth of the apology.  This, I nurtured to the very last moment.</p>
<p>A simple yet sincere “sorry” would’ve been all it took for me to wipe his sentence clean.  The retraction, at so late an hour, surely might’ve riled every corner of the 5th to no small vexation.  But I cared not.  My own end loomed near.  To be wedded off to some son of a viscount.  To hang up the mareschal’s cape and quit the halls of the Order forever.</p>
<p>Would Rolf at last be wise to his faults?  To realise what relief a single apology could accord him?  Met now, as he is, with the reality that soon would we go our separate ways?  His erstwhile self has ever and always done the right.  Surely, then, there is in him the spark to do the same here.</p>
<p>These thoughts rumbled in my heart as I looked intently upon him.  And Rolf, standing on the verge of departure, looked back.</p>
<p>“Be well, then.”</p>
<p>His last words before he set out.</p>
<p>Words, terse and clean.  A sword cutting the ties between us.</p>
<p>I but remained there on horseback, utterly aghast, drained of all strength and inspiration to leap off and run to his side.  On and on, I stared at his vanishing figure.</p>
<p>He had but to bow his head.  He had but to bend the knee.  And all would be as before.  Why hadn’t he, then?</p>
<p>Again, the questions cackled away at me.</p>
<p>Again, the answers remained silent.</p>
<p>Rolf was ever at my side.  From our earliest days.  From our most faded memories.  From when we were wide-eyed babes, scarce able to keep a running stride through a world we barely knew aught about.</p>
<p>When there was joy, we rejoiced together.</p>
<p>When there was sorrow, we rued together.</p>
<p>A party dress.</p>
<p>My very first.  Gifted with it, I frolicked all through the room in elation, twirling with haphazard steps.  Then did I take Rolf’s hands, and together we danced and danced, till I was a spent and breathless mess.</p>
<p>A canary.</p>
<p>My very own.  Dear little Thibaud, filled with pluck and song.  But on the day silent of his last vitality, I wept on and on, till came Rolf to my side.  And there he stayed for the rest of the day, quiet and condoling.</p>
<p>Never could I have imagined that Rolf would be gone.</p>
<p>Ever and always would he be here with me.</p>
<p>This, I believed.  For the longest, longest time.</p>
<p>But ‘twas not so.</p>
<p>‘Twas never to be.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>To a border province goes he so branded a knight-exile.</p>
<p>‘Tis a rule writ in neither stone nor law, but in precedence, one that curtailed my efforts to select for Rolf a closer destination.  What was chosen instead was Balasthea Stronghold, sat in the yonder province of Ström.</p>
<p>Nary a soldier or banner of an Order would be found there.  Protecting those lands in lieu of our knightly presence were the presiding margrave’s own men.  The same held true for Balasthea.  Thus was there no direct connection between the fort and any of the Orders themselves.</p>
<p>But ‘twas a plain fact that we knights compose the royal military.  Hence did the margrave—himself appointed and funded by the Londosian royalty—find his army subordinate to our own, by rights.  Were a post in his ranks vacant, ‘twas well within my authority to fill it, an opportunity I quickly seized for Rolf’s sake.</p>
<p>“Seasoned noble serviceman” was to be his official status upon employment at Balasthea.  Admittedly, a “serviceman” whose entire tenure was spent as a swain, and a “noble” who was all but disinherited—caveats that would be most difficult to hide, I’m sure.  Yet the technicalities bore little weight in the end, and ‘twas thanks to this very designation that the transferral went through at all.</p>
<p>Rolf…</p>
<p>No matter the cost, he must not be made to fight.</p>
<p>From now on would he live in a land straddling the terrible den of the Nafílim.  A land that my protective hand ill-reached.  For him, to step into the frontlines would be to step through death’s door itself.</p>
<p>‘Twas a fate he could not defy.</p>
<p>And for why but that he was weak?</p>
<p>Not even I could deny that sad truth any longer.  And ‘twas neither for his lack of odyl nor his defeats at the end of every spar of late.</p>
<p>Nay…  ‘Twas simply that he was no longer one to confront his faults.</p>
<p>Admitting to weakness.  Aspiring to strength.  Virtues most absolute in their necessity, honoured by all who wager their lives on the battlefield.  Virtues, now lost to Rolf.  There, on that same battlefield, would the fates send every arrow and spell to pierce him in his tragic flight.</p>
<p>And there… there, would he die.</p>
<p>I could not let that happen.</p>
<p>Heretofore have I constrained myself and silenced the beggings of my heart, that I might not give to Rolf any undue favour or treatment.  But to set him loose to his own end?  Such was a mercy stroke, not constraint.  I’ll not hide my reservations, my despair for his changed conduct, but to have him suffer a senseless death was something I could not, for the life of me, allow.</p>
<p>A bittersweet fortune, then, that the commandant of Balasthea was taken ill, whose now-vacant seat I gave to Rolf.  ‘Twas not at all an arrangement met warmly by Central, but through my sheer persistence were its magisters convinced.  Likely they thought him one most wont to fatally slip up somewhere, but I thought otherwise.  After all, for however much he lacked teeth in battle, he excelled in dictating it.</p>
<p>From the war-table, then.  Donned with the title of Acting Commandant would Rolf thrive.  This, I believed.</p>
<p>With him safe from the maw of the frontlines, I at last knew some measure of relief.  Yet it did little to fill the void in my heart.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>Moons had passed.</p>
<p>The season had turned.</p>
<p>A span of days empty of Rolf’s company.  The emptiest, then, of all the days I’d lived.</p>
<p>But in it, some solace from the fates: the unmaking of my betrothal to the son of House Albeck, on account of a scandal unveiled in his manor.  ‘Twas nothing less than a cause for celebration, to be sure.  Only, the one with whom I wished most to celebrate was now long gone.</p>
<p>There was, however, a spark in these sullen days.  Meagre, yes, but a source of mirth nonetheless: of late, I found myself keen on reading the reports.</p>
<p>Of course, such reports—in their many reams—were hitherto quick to earn my daily dread just as they were to pile upon my desk.  And pile they did, for we mareschals of the disparate Orders are duty-bound to share amongst one another the tidings from the many battlefields of Londosius.  Especially so from the border provinces, foremost bulwarks as they are against the Nafílim tide.  Indeed, nary a frontline goes unheard on the daily.</p>
<p>My ears had heard their fill too long ago, to be quite honest.  The reports were as birds teeming into my columbarium of a chamber to great bedlam; just the sight of them flocking on my desk was enough to turn my stomach.</p>
<p>But in the last few months, there was, amongst the irksome bundles, a line of reports that brought colour to these grey days.</p>
<p>Namely, tidings from faraway Ström.</p>
<p>A fringeland where stood Balasthea Stronghold, Rolf’s place of employ.</p>
<p>‘Twas there that he alone turned their fortunes: the soldiery, reorganised; the tactics, revised; the battles, won at last.  The fort was now a distant cry from the hungry coffin that it once was.  Why, ‘twas that very same ill-repute that so enticed the 5th’s leadership to send Rolf to the terrible fort in the first place…</p>
<p>…and what drove me to save him.  Given the mantle of commandant by my decree, he was safeguarded from the obligation of frontline fighting.</p>
<p>Imagine the throbbing veins on the leadership’s temples as they learnt of Balasthea’s turnaround, all thanks to Rolf’s command.  The reports were well worth the reread, for I found great joy in recounting his deeds.</p>
<p>Yet, sallowing those moments was the shade of discontent.  Had he done for the 5th what he did for Balasthea, perhaps Rolf would’ve long been made a knight.</p>
<p>True; he never was given the breadth to spread his wings.  And neither was his circumstance ever blessed to much degree.  But always had I wished for Rolf to apply himself more than he did.</p>
<p>And then.</p>
<p>An idea.</p>
<p><i>…Circumstance.</i></p>
<p>Yes…</p>
<p>Given proper circumstance, it may yet be possible to bring Rolf back from exile.</p>
<p>I sat more deeply at my desk, clothed in thought.</p>
<p>‘Tis certain that he was cast away from the 5th’s halls on account of faults he dared not admit to.  But perhaps his fruitful time in Ström has scraped off that stubborn patina.  Perhaps he may yet become a man willing to confess to his mistakes.  Perhaps… someone with the strength to confront his weaknesses.</p>
<p>And then, were he to reflect upon himself with all sincerity…</p>
<p>And apologise with all due gravity…</p>
<p>Whilst irrefutably decorated with his merits at Balasthea…</p>
<p>Then, perhaps his return to the 5th might be within reach.</p>
<p>It didn’t have to be now.  He may take his time.  But given it, the possibility may be born anew upon the horizon.  And with my betrothal to Kenneth now undone, my tenure here at the 5th should continue well into the foreseeable future.  If so, I’d very much like for Rolf to be here beside me along the way.</p>
<p>“Rolf…”</p>
<p>Is he changed?</p>
<p>Nay…</p>
<p>Is he back to his past self?</p>
<p>Has he abandoned the servility nurtured in these dark years, for the former gallantry of years more blissful?</p>
<p>To the window I looked, where spanned the far skies of the fringelands.  There, my once-betrothed yet drew breath.</p>
<p>And for him, I yearned.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>“Well, if it isn’t our star!  Heard the big news, we have, Emilie.  Why, I’d be a plump and happy man were pride a treat to be savoured.  This calls for a celebration: to a baroness reborn!”</p>
<p>“O-oh, you shouldn’t, Gerd.  But thank you.”</p>
<p>“Hold, now.  Not a promotion, were it?  What’s the diff, then, ey?”</p>
<p>“It was no promotion at all, Miss Raakel.  Our dearest mareschal here has instead been accorded a fief all her own.”</p>
<p>The collective rejoicing of the Owlcrane flock.  ‘Twas celebratory enough, really, to see them so aglow with merriment.  Smiles were all about—even upon my own lips.</p>
<p>“And headship, as well, to a new family,” Sheila went on.  “‘House Valenius’, if I am not mistaken?”</p>
<p>“You’ve the right of it,” I confirmed.  “Though I should admit, the name plays much at pretension.  Airing it alone flusters my cheeks.”</p>
<p>It all began with the Albecks’ wrongdoing.</p>
<p>When I’d been given the news, that the engagement was off the table asudden, I’d assumed the cause to be of the usual affair: embezzlement, infidelity, the sort of cunning that the nobility were so wont to indulge.</p>
<p>Appalling, then, that ‘twas more nefarious again than anything I could’ve imagined.  For the sinful natures of Viscount Albeck and Kenneth were laid bare: both were paraphiles to an extreme, hedonist princes who derived fleshly pleasure from the violence and humiliation they inflicted upon women.  Such victims were kidnapped, gaoled, and made to suffer all manner of atrocities.</p>
<p>The evidence astounded no less: below the Albeck manor were discovered the skeletal remains of countless souls lost.  And amongst them were the remnants of none other than the viscount’s prior wives, all once falsely assumed to have perished by accident.</p>
<p>There was I, well on the verge of joining them.</p>
<p>Kenneth himself was apparently quite… “taken” with me, and from testimonials gained, he had tasked much thought to our “honeymoon”.  When the foul particulars were revealed to me, I well-remember being sickened to abrupt nausea.</p>
<p>No family, even decorated with such historical repute as the Albecks, could dare endure in the face of such travesty.  And so, House Albeck knew ruin.  Their land as well, the eponymous viscounty, was beheaded of its lord.</p>
<p>And now, filling that vacancy: myself.</p>
<p>That’s right.  The Londosian royals saw fit to pass the Albeck territories over to me as a fief.  House Mernesse was to remain untouched, whilst I was to be made founder to a wholly new family: House Valenius.</p>
<p>The Lady Emilie, Dame Mareschal to the 5th Order.</p>
<p>And now, mistress to the Valenius barony.</p>
<p>The arrangement was one of convenience.  I was originally to involve myself in the affairs of that province anyway, as wife to Kenneth and future viscountess of House Albeck.  And I had prestige enough to warrant the wedding: namely, my hand in the recapture of Godrika, the Battle of Erbelde, and so on.  The puzzle pieces were already in place, so to speak.</p>
<p>But of course, the solving hands had a motive of their own.</p>
<p>The Lady Estelle Tiselius, Dame Mareschal to the 1st Order—hers was a fraught relationship with Central, if the gossipers were to be trusted.  Indeed, the illustrious hero-dame was more a thorn in Central’s side, though one too ingrained to be extracted by the pliers of political artifice.</p>
<p>And so the magisters saw need of a new hero.  Someone whom they could groom with gifts of prestige and clout.  A seed of their own choosing, from which would sprout their next idol.  And as the fates would have it, I was the one selected from amongst the many specimens, meritious and folk-favoured as I was.</p>
<p>For that reason, I was kept from undertaking the rigours of my new office as baroness of Valenius.  Central espied much use in me as a mareschal, thus was I to continue my duties here at the 5th, whilst a Central-appointed consul was to preside over the province in my stead.</p>
<p>“Hah.  Well, fair <i>Baroness of Valenius,”</i> poked Gerd.  “You are yet our mareschal, and for that, I should like to make a toast: to many more years of your leadership!”</p>
<p>“Oh, stop that…”</p>
<p>I felt friction, then.  Of being celebrated when I had not the spirit for it.  Of being called a baroness, when I had not a baron to be by my side.</p>
<p>There were, however, those that celebrated my situation for a different reason: I was, apparently, the first in all of Londosian history to be both a serving mareschal and the sitting head of a noble family.  Such was hitherto seen only in bedtime fables, what with princesses or dukes not rarely taking up the sword to make battle.  That the trope of legend was realised, here and now, caused quite the stir amongst the knightly ranks and common folk alike.</p>
<p>‘Twas blind revelry, really.  I was no princess nor duchess, but a mere baroness, one whose provincial charges were relinquished to a faceless steward, no less.  And yet the people of this realm still lionised me as some swashbuckling mistress.  I had gratitude for their affections, certainly, but of late their zeal was stoked by naught but half-falsities.  ‘Twas very much a development that had me ill at ease.</p>
<p>“Come now, Emilie love!  Yer high an’ mighty now, yea?  Have a bit o’ fun, why don’t ye!  Throw yer weight ‘round like a real noble!  Why, if I wore yer heels, I’d have that miser o’ a mess hall rebuilt proper—big, an’ roomy-like!  Oh, an’ a roof fer the trainin’ grounds ain’t a bad idea either, innit?”</p>
<p>A bit of tomfoolery from Raakel, met with laughter all around.  But she had a point—a rather convincing one.</p>
<p>An epiphany, actually.</p>
<p>My mind raced.</p>
<p>Loath though I was to admit, I had in fact gained no small sway.  My voice reached many ears, and just as many were fain to listen, even to requests of unreason.</p>
<p>Like, let’s say, of welcoming back an exile.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>I perused through the desk-strewing reports once more.  It was quiet; nary a peep sounded in my chamber, save for the occasional shuffling of papers and parchments.</p>
<p>Balasthea—not yet has its stream of merits let up.  What once saw nigh-catastrophic casualties on the daily now sees nearly none at all, a development clearly following Rolf’s instalment as commandant.</p>
<p>‘Tis a turnaround that impresses no less with each reread.  Not long ago at all was Balasthea a veritable killing field.  Miraculous, to be so transformed into a steeled bastion, where casualties have been made a rarity.  Such an achievement paved more boldly the path to Rolf’s return to the Order, a possibility waxing to probability with each passing day.</p>
<p>But an impasse well-stunts its fruition—to bridge it, I need a plan.  While true that my words now carry great weight, heavier still is the stigma of Rolf’s exile, a stain that cannot be so easily wiped clean through meritous service alone.</p>
<p>In dire need of a hint to unravel this skein, I rummaged through the other reports.  ‘Twas then that a certain word caught my eye.</p>
<p>“Chief Adjutant”.</p>
<p>The skein revealed a loose thread at last.</p>
<p>Over the past two winters, Londosius’ war-waging had expanded in both scope and vigour, a trend sparked by my costly success at Godrika.  To cope with the belligerent demand, each of the Orders underwent changes to its regime.  Not least of which was the birth of the chief adjutant role, for ‘twas swiftly understood that we mareschals might require a close advisor to better manage the new rigours of our office, in light of the burgeoning scale of the battles.</p>
<p>Of the Orders, the 2nd had already commissioned an adjutant of its own, and to that moment, the post was serving its purposes well.</p>
<p>Certainly none would protest were I to avail the 5th of the same.</p>
<p>And just as the 2nd had done, I should open the position to all aspirants—that is, regarding little if they hold any present affiliation with the Order or no.  But to match the acumen required of an adjutant, they must have some years of prior service in the Order under their belt.  And to pair with it, some experience in field command as well.</p>
<p>Ah, that’s right.</p>
<p>“Applicants seeking frontline service shall also be accepted”—a condition I should not do without.</p>
<p>A chief adjutant minds warcraft more than he does war-waging, true, but ever the connoisseur of the sword, Rolf would inevitably find himself close to the action.  ‘Tis certain: once in the near past did I bid him throw down the sword and brave anew the path of the strategist.  ‘Twas an earnest suggestion that he ultimately refused.</p>
<p>‘Tis certain again, however, that he did admit strategy as being amongst the pillars of chivalric duty.  His heart, then, was that he simply wished not to give up the blade.  This I should not deny him of, regardless of the erstwhile nature of the adjutant role.</p>
<p>Now, one more condition.</p>
<p>“Neither past deeds done nor offences justly disciplined shall be of any account”—the one line of greatest import.  In other words, Rolf’s exile shall be a matter wholly unenquired of.</p>
<p>…Oh, were it so simple.</p>
<p>To regard that very line, with nary a worry for its implications, would surely be a failure of my office.  As a mareschal, as a superior, this was the one facet I could not leave uncut.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, I have hope.  Hope that Rolf will answer my veiled call.  Hope that he will come back.  And when he stands before me at last, an apology is what my ears must first hear from his lips.</p>
<p>Only…</p>

<p>Were I to find him fast believing that all is forgiven…</p>
<p>…were I to find him forgetful of all that has come before…</p>
<p>…then what’s left to me is to abandon him once and for all.</p>

<p>But ‘twill be all right.</p>
<p>I believe in him.</p>
<p>From his deeds at Balasthea, I can rightly tell: back in his heart is his once-lost strength.  The strength to admit his faults.  The strength to confront his weaknesses.</p>
<p>The Rolf I’ve always known.  The Rolf who would gladly apologise.</p>
<p>Had this strength found him during the hearing, certainly he would be right here with me in this very chamber, at this very moment.</p>
<p>Once more, then.  Just once more will I accord him a chance.</p>
<p>Taking it, he shall unfurl his sail of remorse.</p>
<p>Seeing it, I will call my winds of mercy.</p>
<p>And then, together, shall we resume our voyage anew.</p>
<p>A voyage upon seas of a different temperament, for no longer am I a hare ensnared in an unsought betrothal, but the head of House Valenius.</p>
<p>I feign no doubt that Central will infringe upon matters of my marriage.  But I’ll not brook their gall.  Not one bit.  No matter how viciously they come to bite and tear us apart, I’ll stay them by their leashes, one way or another.</p>
<p>And then…</p>

<p>…And then, I will marry Rolf.</p>
<p>And together, we will be lord and lady of Valenius.</p>

<p>A future long-faded.</p>
<p>A dream long-deserted.</p>
<p>Now renewed.</p>
<p>Now within reach.</p>
<p>Oh, how my heart raced.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>And still did my heart race.</p>
<p>From morning till this moment, for today was the long-awaited commencement: to be held was the official screening for the post of Chief Adjutant of the 5th Chivalric Order.</p>
<p>But ‘twas more an intimate affair, held in a small conference room in the headquarters proper.  Gathered were the top brass of the 5th: myself, the under-mareschal, the Owlcranes, and the brigadiers, including Felicia herself.  And together, ‘twas our charge hereupon to meet the aspirants one-by-one.  To enquire of them, to know of them, through and through.</p>
<p>Yes…</p>
<p>Long-awaited, indeed.</p>
<p>Months now, it’s been, since I’ve last laid eyes on Rolf.</p>
<p>To see him again…</p>
<p>The thought was as a fresh wind billowing upon my dour sails.</p>
<p>But I’ll not forget my office, of course.  The screening must be carried out with all fairness.  To that end, I mean to spare Rolf not an inkling of leniency.  To earn back his place amongst us, and my side as chief adjutant besides, he must prove himself more worthy again than all others of like ambition.</p>
<p>A knock upon the door.  In peeked a knight, one charged with the day’s clerical duties.</p>
<p>“Madame,” he called, “we’ve a fair gathering of aspirants at present.  Shall we start soon?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes,” I answered before yielding a deep breath.  “Right.  Let us begin.”</p>
<p>“As you wish.  The first shall appear shortly.”</p>
<p>The wheels were turning at last.  And with them, the fraying of my nerves.  A bit silly, really.  ‘Tis not I that’s being screened, after all.</p>
<p>Nay…  There’re worries aplenty to be had.  The leaders, gathered here to judge the aspirants alongside me—there’s no doubt in my mind that they would resist full-fervent Rolf’s very presence, let alone the idea of selecting him for so notable a position.</p>
<p>But Rolf himself has done many an outstanding deed in Ström.  Deeds that none here can overlook.  And with a show of sincere remorse for the incident of months past, as well as my ensuing support, the pieces of the puzzle are sure to fall in place.</p>
<p>And when they do, the way shall finally be unbarred: the way towards a future, together.</p>
<p>“Pardon.”</p>
<p>With a knock, the first aspirant entered the room—a man seemingly in his forties.</p>
<p>“Good morning, ser,” I greeted him.  “Pray have a seat.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, madame.”</p>
<p>And there in a lone chair did he sit, one vis-a-vis us leaders, sat as we were in a single row.  Intimidating, to be sure.</p>
<p>“&#8230;You’d have done well had you been first…”</p>
<p>A murmur from Felicia, verging on a whisper too faint for an unattentive ear to catch.  And who else were they for but her own brother?  Truth be told, she spoke the words writ also in my own heart, for I, too, wished Rolf had been the first to cross that door.</p>
<p>But alas.  I yet had my duties as a mareschal to fulfil, and any aspirant passing through the doorway must be accorded my fair and earnest judgement.</p>
<p>With my spirits set, I looked to the gentleman before me and commenced the assessment.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>The screenings went on uninhibitedly.  ‘Twas on the eve of noon that we were sat afront our fourth aspirant.</p>
<p>“&#8230;‘Tis writ here that you’ve assumed command on the field.  To wit, on the southern fronts of yesteryear,” I said, looking at the papers.  “Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Indeed I have, madame,” nodded the aspirant.  “There we were, cornered, <i>disadvantaged.</i>  My men were fraught and affrighted, and our foe saw victory on the horizon.  But by my wits did we wear them down with nary a hole in our stores.  And on the seventh day of that long struggle, we drove them off and snatched victory—right from the front of their noses!”</p>
<p>“Faith!  ‘Twas <i>your</i> hand that checked that game, good sir?” gasped one of the leaders.  “Why, we hardly talked of aught else when we’d read the reports!  And justly so; ‘twas a fine manoeuvre, sir!  Standing steadfast like you did!”</p>
<p>“Good man!  Glad am I to be so warmly remembered,” our aspirant beamed.  “Oh verily, the moment bears my proudest mark.  No other soul in that battle could’ve hoped to match my merits, I dare say!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, sir, for that glowing account,” I said.  “Right.  I believe we’ve heard enough.  We shall apprise you of the results in the coming days.”</p>
<p>“And with bated breath shall I wait,” he returned, rising and bowing.  “Though you should know, madame.  I am quite the steal, if I do say so myself.  Hm hm!”</p>
<p>“That you are, sir.  Thank you.”</p>
<p>With that, the fourth assessment was concluded.  As for the aspirant himself, he made certain not to leave without looking straight my way and airing another expectation of a good tiding.</p>
<p>“My…” Sheila sighed.  “Our aspirants thus far—with such spirit do they sell themselves.  To some success might they pitch the selling of this very kingdom for a coin, were they to try.”</p>
<p>“I likes it well ‘nough, their spirit,” Raakel chimed in.  “Shows motivation, <i>passion.”</i></p>
<p>The words of the two rang quite true.  The aspirants certainly imbued ardour in their persuasion.  And as if that weren’t enough, some amongst them belonged to the higher Orders.  I had wondered of what compelled them to apply to the 5th, the lowest of the bunch.  ‘Twas then that Gerd offered an answer.</p>
<p>“Hah.  Likely the work of the ‘Emilie effect’, as I like to call it.  All riled and ready to fight alongside our new hero-dame, they are.  As they should be!”</p>
<p>Loath though I was to admit, he spoke the grain of truth.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Whatever the case, we break here,” I said, standing up from my seat.  “Let’s reconvene in an hour hence.”</p>
<p>With that, the leadership collectively shuffled and stretched, whilst I promptly exited the room.  To the knight clerk I went.</p>
<p>“Pardon.  How many remain?” I asked him.</p>
<p>“Twelve, madame.  They wait in the parlour as we speak.  We expect more to arrive as the day waxes, however.”</p>
<p>“Is that right…”</p>
<p>“More again have answered your call than any could’ve imagined.  I’ll bat not an eye if our work continues well into the night.  Stringent indeed were the criteria, but they have done little to abate the flood of aspirants drawn to your beacon, madame.”</p>
<p>“H-have they now…?” I yielded, somewhat afluster.  “Right.  Let’s keep at it then.  There’s much ahead of us.”</p>
<p>Parting from the clerk’s company, I went down the corridor, stopping just before the entrance to the parlour.  There, I took in as deep a breath as my lungs allowed, and oh so slowly exhaled.  Hand upon my heart, I calmed my nerves.</p>
<p>Then, with perhaps too much caution, I peeked inside.</p>
<p>Within were twelve, all of different ages.  And amongst them—</p>
<p>“Emilie.”</p>
<p><i>“Hya!?”</i></p>
<p>—a voice prodded me from behind, teasing a silly yelp from my lips.  I swivelled about, finding Felicia standing near.</p>
<p>“Has the man shown himself yet?” she asked, surely referring to Rolf himself.</p>
<p>Of late, she’d ceased speaking of him with any warmth.  It must be months now since I’d last heard the word “Brother” from her mouth.  ‘Twas a change, I gather, precipitated by his silent incapacity for apology at the hearing of months past.  A change that only darkened her despair for her once-beloved brother.</p>
<p>“N-no, not yet, from the look of it.”</p>
<p>“The nerve…” she sighed.  “Such a boon that awaits him.  And he had but to be the repentant earlybird to claim it.  How clouded be his eyes, that so simple an appeal is lost to their sight?”</p>
<p>How biting they were, the words of a sister for her own bloodkin.</p>
<p>Yet in faith, her heart was willing to forgive him.  This I knew very well.  She was amongst those I had privately consulted of putting together this very affair.  A conversation, in which course, found her immediately wise to its true intention: to give Rolf another chance.</p>
<p>Even then, in spite of her bitter demeanour, she aired nary a breath of disapproval.</p>
<p>Indeed, the will to forgive Rolf was yet hale in her.</p>
<p>Or perhaps, the desire.</p>
<p>“He sees well enough, Felicia,” I attempted to assuage her.  “‘Twon’t be long before he arrives, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>“And you should sooner give up on coddling him so, dear Emilie,” she said, softening upon addressing me.  “There’s no need to humour him if he intends to keep playing the pouting toddler.  We otherwise chance slighting the other aspirants.”</p>
<p>“Yes, Felicia, I know.  The assessments shall be done in full fairness, I swear,” was my assurance to her, after which I gave one more glance through the parlour.</p>
<p>Not less than five years of service in the Order…</p>
<p>Field experience in military command…</p>
<p>The souls I saw inside were all mete with those conditions.  And as such, they were each a tempered knight, full-fledged and full-ready to tackle the burden of chief adjutant.</p>
<p>But Rolf will be just fine.</p>
<p>He has to be.</p>
<p>By none of them would he be outshone or overshadowed.</p>
<p>This, I kept pondering.</p>
<p>And thus, did I keep yearning for our reunion.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Four hours had gone by since we reconvened for the afternoon session.  Titian noonlight sighed through the windows.</p>
<p>“Thank you, honoured knights all.  I shall await the good word.”</p>
<p>The aspirant dame before us curtsied, and summarily left the conference room.</p>
<p>“She, too, is quite the star, I must say,” said one amongst the leadership.  “That she had a hand in the Rossantine defence is most assuring.”</p>
<p>“Yes…” I remarked.  “It certainly is.”</p>
<p>Truly, the dame’s deeds were not wanting.  Just as true, however, was that the stronghold of Rossant was not especially fraught in its plight.  A pale comparison, really, to the deathly circumstance of Balasthea, made deathly no more by Rolf.  ‘Twas his deeds that I found to be more vaulting, miraculous even.</p>
<p>I looked to the clerk at the doorway.  “How many more?”</p>
<p>“Four in the parlour, madame.  The stream of late arrivals looks to be drying up, too, from the look of it.”</p>
<p>“I see.  Thank you.”  I rose from my seat once more.  “Everyone, let’s break for now.  We reconvene in twenty.”</p>
<p>A rustling rose from the leaders once more as I left the room.  Met with fresher air, I gave a stretch.</p>
<p><i>“Haah…”</i></p>
<p>How tiring.</p>
<p>Even as mareschal, I yet ill-take to measuring others with such stringency.</p>
<p>…Nay.  That wasn’t it at all.</p>
<p>‘Twas the hours of disappointment.  Of welcoming in aspirants to the assessment, one after another, to see not Rolf’s face, but only unacquainted ones.  A repetition ever-wearing away at my nerves.</p>
<p>By now, there nagged in me the itch of annoyance.  But casting it off with a shake of my head, I went and peeked into the parlour once more.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Mm…”</p>
<p>Rolf wasn’t there.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>Felicia’s prior words rang through my mind.  More clearly, and truly now, as I pondered further of them.  ‘Twas to Rolf’s utmost benefit to show up at the earliest and make plain his remorse to us all.  Yet to instead have us sit in grating anticipation… ‘twas passing strange.</p>
<p>The rumination did little but tinge my annoyance towards anger.</p>
<p>But in the course of that reddening, a new concern was awakened in me.  One I felt was beyond all possibility.  And yet I found myself unable to silence the foreboding.</p>
<p>…Could it be?</p>
<p>That Rolf’s not coming?</p>
<p>No.</p>
<p>What in the world am I thinking?</p>
<p>‘Tis Rolf’s long-lived dream to become a knight.  And so it is that here, the Order, honoured hall of chivalry and esteemed service, is where he truly belongs.</p>
<p>Admittedly, he has erred along his path.  But I am here.  Here to give him another chance.  Here to let him retrace his steps and tread anew the right way.  Here to welcome him back to my side.</p>
<p>He will come.</p>
<p>I know he will.</p>
<p>But in knowing such did I feel every minute and second drag on grindingly.</p>
<p>How tiring, indeed…  More so than I’d anticipated.</p>
<p>With a deep breath to renew my spirits again, I wound about and began to make my way back to the conference room.  ‘Twas then that I found Gerd approaching from down the corridor.</p>
<p>“There you are, Emilie,” he called.</p>
<p>“Why, Gerd.  We reconvene soon.  You should head bac—”</p>
<p>“Still waiting for that ungraced, aren’t you?”  There was a flatness of tone in his timbre.  A clouded guardedness from which nothing could be gleaned.  “The criteria—tailor-made for him, weren’t they?  No point in hiding the tale now, Emilie.  These eyes of mine are hardly the sole pair that’s seen through the smoke.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I’ll not forget fairness in my duties here.”</p>
<p>“And so you won’t.  Not that I had any doubt, of course.”  With those words aired, Gerd went and had a glance through the parlour himself.  “Hm.  The man of the hour—nowhere to be seen.”</p>
<p>“Nowhere indeed.”</p>
<p>An answer of mine, dammed by as much reticence as I could muster, for I felt then that committing to aught would’ve soured the moment immediately.</p>
<p>“Tell me, Emilie,” Gerd said, turning back to me.  “Have we real need of him?  That ungraced.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I should think so,” I returned carefully.  “You’ve heard of what’s happened at Balasthea, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“That I have.”</p>
<p>“And Erbelde, Godrika…  You saw with your own eyes.  We all did.  How lost we would’ve been, were it not for him.”</p>
<p>“I know that full-well, sure.”</p>
<p>“Yet still you brand him an ‘ungraced’?”</p>
<p>Remaining non-committal was my intent in this conversation, but in its course did I find my words smouldering more and more redly.</p>
<p>“As I ought to.  That’s what he is.  That’s what he’s been <i>denied.”</i></p>
<p>“And to be denied is too profane a stigma, in your eyes?”</p>
<p>“Profane enough.  For me, and for many, many others,” Gerd answered, before stepping past me and beginning his way back to the conference room.  “Still, you have my trust, Emilie.  And my ear, and my sword.  As well as everyone else’s, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>Words from his parting figure.</p>
<p>I stood there, somewhat whelmed by it all, before I thought to follow him back.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>More turns of the hourglass.</p>
<p>The moment found us done with our twentieth assessment.</p>
<p><i>“Hoo—ah,”</i> Raakel stretched.  “Ay, I’m shag’d.  We’ve met, what, a full score o’ them so far, ey?  By gum, had even got pensioners back from their pastures, we did.”</p>
<p>A sentiment hardly hers alone.  By now, the nightly hour and the other leaders both were weary and wearing on.</p>
<p>“How many left now?” I asked.</p>
<p>“All but two more,” the clerk answered.  “The finish line’s in sight, madame; let’s have this race run.”</p>
<p>Two…</p>
<p>More and more were my doubts given reality, as that very number dwindled with Rolf absent from its count.  Felicia, too, had clearly lost much hopeful softness from her face.  Yet however taxed we were, the clerk relented little in showing in our next aspirant.</p>
<p>A bow.  “My fair Mareschal Valenius.  How long has it been?”</p>
<p>This man.</p>
<p>I knew his face.</p>
<p>With him did I brave the Battle of Erbelde.  With him did I often meet in the halls of Central—more times than I care to admit.  Nevertheless, I gestured for him to take his seat.</p>
<p>But no sooner did Gerd begin to mutter with some sharpness.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Erik Lindell.”</p>
<p>Indeed, ‘twas Sir Erik Lindell—knight of the 1st, leader to its Owlcranes.</p>
<p>My warm impressions of him were scant, if not wholly vacant.  Of Lindell, I recall foremost the pummelling vehemence he exacted upon Rolf on the eve of the Erbelde operation.  The bruises shading my once-betrothed’s face were as clear in my mind as when I saw them three years past—just as clear as the vaulting words with which I then protested to his mareschal.</p>
<p>And that’s to say nothing of his advances, however subtle and unsettling they may be.  Yes.  There was in Lindell a fixation upon me, the nagging capstone to my dim opinion of him.</p>
<p>“That I am—Erik Lindell of the 1st Chivalric Order,” he bowed again.  “At your service, gentles all.”</p>
<p>No few amongst the leadership were then roused with awe.</p>
<p>“Why, in faith!  ‘Tis the lieutenant of the 1st’s Owlcranes!”</p>
<p>“Mareschal Tiselius’ bosom-blade!  Here in the flesh!  What earns us this pleasure, now?”</p>
<p>“My good knights!” Lindell heartily laughed.  “Oh!  You lionise me doubly-half than I half-doubly deserve!”</p>
<p>Byzantine modesty, concealed by a honeyed smile—the other leaders were quick to revere the lieutenant, but I myself shared none of their enthusiasm.  But then did Sheila part her lips with a gentle blade of a question, as if to air my very thoughts.</p>
<p>“Lord Lindell.  A matter, if I may?”</p>
<p>“Hm?  Ah, the fair Dame Sheila Larsen, yes?  Most certainly, my Lady.”</p>
<p>“The illustrious lion of the 1st seeks to join the 5th—curious, I must say,” she began with not a break in her mild smile.  “Oh, Yoná be merciful: are those puppet strings mine eyes espy?  Dangling from the hands of Central?”</p>
<p>There were some amongst our leaders in whose ears Sheila’s words rang with uneasy meaning.  In their faces now were smiles fading against some throbbing suspicion.</p>
<p>“Come now, my dear Lady.  You but espy a fancy from the faeries, I’m afraid,” Lindell returned, his visage wholly unstruck by the turn of the moment’s tone.</p>
<p>Yet in spite of his denial, there was weight to Sheila’s observation.  Friction was what’s immediately found between Central and the Mareschal Tiselius.  And ‘twas this very friction that compelled the administrative grasp to swipe from her the mantle of hero-dame, and with it, drape my shoulders instead.</p>
<p>Thus was there cunning afoot, to wear away at her influence and fame, and pedestalise me in the same stroke.  Lindell’s intent to join our ranks seemed but a tendril stemming from those shadowed designs.</p>
<p>Little corroboration was to be found, then, in Lindell’s rebuttal, for our collective suspicion faded not in the least.  Once more did he then speak, as though the scent of doubt was rank to his nose.</p>
<p>“But suppose for a moment that there is, indeed, some of Central’s puppetry at play.  What matter?  The 5th shall suffer no ill from it, I’m sure.”</p>
<p>“Nay, Sir Erik.  I, for one, see much ill and more in meddling with politics.  And thus do I ill-take to it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, my fair Lady Emilie,” simpered Lindel.  “Your worries, I understand full-well.”</p>
<p><i>Your nonsense, I pity full-heartedly,</i> his mind might’ve said.  Averse to politicking, in such circumstance as I am now—in his ears, I perhaps sounded more the bellyaching child than a prudent leader.</p>
<p>‘Twas then that I recalled his mareschal’s very words.  A man on whom fits the orator’s jerkin just as snugly the knight’s cuirass; a wolf well-practised in rousing the packs to his purposes—not even from the hero-dame was Lindell’s love of political knifery hid.</p>
<p>Lightly, then, must I tread whilst in his company.</p>
<p>“Right,” I spoke anew, cutting the tension.  “In any case, you sit as an aspirant, and we as judges.  Let us proceed, shall we?”</p>
<p>Thus did another assessment commence—now with much caution.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>

<p>“Well then, good leaders all.  Do judge me gently,” Lindell bowed after rising from his seat.</p>
<p>“And so we shall.  You will know our resolve in the coming days,” I answered flatly.</p>
<p>“Ah yes, resolve.  I must say, though there burns in me both reverence and adoration for my mareschal, the Lady Tiselius, more brightly aflame is my own resolve, to lend both hand and heart in ushering in the new age.  My hope, then, that you will accept it.”</p>
<p>With those slithering words did Lindell finally quit our presence.  How serpentine he is, thus we ought to treat him accordingly.  Though truth be told, the moment found me caring little of it, for another matter pressed me more exigently.</p>
<p>I looked to the clerk.  “The next shall be the last, I take it?”</p>
<p>“That is correct, madame.”</p>
<p>“Are you certain?  There remains none in the parlour?”</p>
<p>“Very certain.  One more and the day is done,” he nodded.  “Your endurance astounds, madame.  Just a little more, now.”</p>
<p>Then did the clerk leave to summon the next—and last—aspirant.  The door shut, and at once, my nerves frayed altogether.  Sounds, all of them, seemed to pull away into a weighty silence.  In that ensuing hollow were but two: the heaving of my breaths and the quickening of my heartbeat.</p>

<p>‘Tis all right.</p>
<p>Rolf is most certainly here.</p>
<p>When that door next opens, ‘twill be him that I see.</p>
<p>Him, and no one else.</p>

<p>The stars are aligned.  The stars of our futures, intertwined anew.</p>
<p>Rolf will soon be home again.</p>
<p>Home, by my side.</p>
<p>And together, we’ll fight the Nafílim.</p>
<p>Together, we’ll start a new family.</p>
<p>And then, we’ll walk towards tomorrow and on—together.</p>

<p>Time then seemed to tarry.</p>
<p>Water would’ve flowed like winter honey.</p>
<p>A blink would’ve spanned a whole moment.</p>
<p>In that slowness, leashed taut by suspense, did the door creep open at last.</p>

<p>A man.</p>
<p>Half-greyed.</p>
<p>And not less than twice my age.</p>

<p>Rolf…</p>
<p>…did not come home.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>

<p>The good mister left naught to be desired.</p>
<p>His history found him well-noted: six years in the 4th Order, some spent at the helm of a brigade, and a transfer to Central for a long tenure in its halls.</p>
<p>Eloquent of wit and manner, sagacious and gentlemanly—he was the ideal candidate, truth be told.</p>
<p>“Mareschal Valenius.  Gracious leaders withal.  I pray for patience to endure the long deliberation—and the good news to come.”</p>
<p>Thus did he bow and exit, and in his place then came the clerk.</p>
<p>“Most excellent, everyone.  The screening is ended.”</p>
<p>Breaths exhaled from all around, as if a pent-up wind was released from everyone’s lungs.  Relief, weariness, cheer, corroboration—all were expressed and exchanged.</p>
<p>Yet in its midst…</p>
<p>“&#8230;why… <i>why…?”</i></p>
<p>A poor whisper from Felicia’s lips.  Upon her brows, a grave furrow.  But in her eyes, an emptiness.</p>
<p>To any other, such a mien might’ve seemed too fraught a book to read.  A mist enshrouded her heart, turning away all empathy.  But she is as a sister to me, and so did my own heart know full-well what ailed hers: disbelief, pure and dark, in the face of this newly unveiled reality.</p>
<p>A disbelief I shared.</p>
<p>“Is this… is this truly it?” I asked the clerk.  “We’ve no more aspirants to meet?”</p>
<p>“Indeed, madame.”</p>
<p>“W… what of late arrivals?  For them, we can wait, perhaps…”</p>
<p>A slightly quizzical look.  “The cutoff is passed, madame.  I’m afraid not a soul more shall show up at our doorstep.”</p>
<p>“The kingdom…” I pressed on, “&#8230;to all corners of the kingdom have I opened recruitment.  Sure enough, we’ve met some today hailing from the far reaches.  There may yet be one more making his way here—from too far a corner, perhaps, to make it in time.  For him, we can wait, if even for just a little while.”</p>
<p>We souls of Man are wont to lose our better wits, when afront a reality we cannot bear.  How painfully this resonated, as I aired words unreasonable to any other ear.</p>
<p>“Come now, Emilie,” spoke Gerd.  “If ‘he’ did like the rest, he would’ve arrived the day before, and stayed the night at some inn, no less, as any right-minded travel-folk should do.  Rules are rules, and being on time is one we’ve set.  Bend them, and we forget fairness with full-intention.”</p>
<p>Gerd’s words rang too true.  But I felt in me a wall of denial, shutting away all calls to rationality, just to protect an empty hope.  Rolf <i>must</i> be coming; that he would not was simply inconceivable.</p>
<p>“B… but…”</p>
<p>There did I begin to gainsay Gerd’s argument.  Try as I might, however, what left my lips was but silent air.  The moment that followed, then, was just as quiet.  The leaders, all of them, turned their eyes and ears to me.</p>
<p>Yet to them, I must’ve seemed more the forlorn damsel than a hero-dame, as with my own eyes did I look all through them, seeking their counsel, their corroboration.  Only, their lips remained unmoving.  Justly so, for ‘twas mine that were being begged for motion.</p>
<p>And in the stretches of that muted lull did I finally recognise an aching truth: my dreams, my desires, all that felt so close at hand coursed through its fingers like fine sand.</p>
<p>Just to be blown away by the winds.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Nay…” I surrendered at last, “&#8230;you’re absolutely right.  We end here.”</p>

<p>Yes.  From here on would we, the leadership, deliberate all that we’ve gathered today, and in due course, select the 5th’s new chief adjutant.</p>
<p>One whose name will not be “Rolf Buckmann.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>

<p>I looked all along the parlour, alone.</p>
<p>Here once waited a score and more aspirants.  But the marbled and embroidered room was now dim and empty, even of sound.  Not a soul waited in the lonely space, no matter how much I searched.</p>
<p>‘Twas overlate.  The leaders have all retired for the night.  Through the entryway would come not another person.  Not Rolf.  Not anyone.  A thought, simple as ‘twas crushing.</p>

<p>…Why?</p>
<p>How resolved I was in forgiving him.  How eager I was in reaching out my hand to him.  How certain I was in thinking he’d take it.</p>
<p>Yes…</p>
<p>Certain.</p>
<p>How certainly did I believe that he would come racing home from the faraway frontier.</p>
<p>That he would reflect upon his faults.</p>
<p>That he would apologise for them.</p>
<p>That he would then, from his own lips, say how much he longed to be with me.</p>
<p>The path was all laid out.  I would welcome Rolf into House Valenius as my husband.  Then with the new name would we start a new family and a new life.  A fancy that filled my many whiles.  A path that should’ve been unbarred.</p>
<p>But Rolf isn’t here.</p>
<p>He never came.</p>
<p>The path is vanished.</p>
<p>Was it my fault?  Had my judgement erred somewhere?  Had I unwittingly chosen for myself a world without Rolf?</p>

<p>I stood, and stood, and stood.</p>
<p>All alone, in a soulless parlour.  A sight, a scene, a figure ill-becoming that of a commander of knights.  A lauded prodigy.  A star of Londosius.</p>
<p>Emilie Valenius.  Hero-dame for the new age.</p>
<p>…What a seed for laughter.</p>
