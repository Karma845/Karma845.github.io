<h2 style="text-align:center;">Extra</h2>

<p>Norden air chimed with birdsong as I strolled beneath the green shade.  The avenues were swept and clean, but bustled alive just the same.  Quite the breath of fresh air from the manicured courts of Central, from which I’d gleefully departed but a while ago.</p>
<p>The marquisate laid a ways off the homebound road, of course, but I was hardly here on business.  No, suffering the summons from Central was dreary business enough.  Rather, I merely thought to have a reprieve ere mine earnest way home.</p>
<p>Speaking of homes, ‘twas in this very marquisate that the 5th was based.  Rumours were abound: ‘twas not too long ago that one within its ranks was made an exile—the same rumours that piqued mine interest, enough that I’d a mind to delve more deeply.  And where better to task mine eyes and ears than the gossiping streets themselves?  After all, there are myriad things to be privy to beyond the stifling halls of an Order.</p>
<p>“Mademoiselle, ‘tis clear even to my own well-worn eyes that you mean to stick your nose into the affairs of the 5th—from the very start, I should say!  You speak of touring the town for a mite of merriment, but no, I know that tongue of yours to be <i>too</i> honest to tell a good lie.”</p>
<p>Francis’ words, aired with a sigh here and there as he walked in tow.</p>
<p>But I brushed them off lightly, for the burden upon my shoulders was aught <i>but</i> light: weighing them down, amongst many other things, was the high charge of Londosius itself.  Alas, I could not attend only to mine own Order; I must needs ever set watch upon the goings-on within the realm.</p>
<p>Indeed.  I <i>most certainly</i> was not here on a whim of the heart.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>The talk of the town was all but warmly aglow for the Dame Mareschal of the 5th.  Be they errand-running maids, craft-honing artisans, mischief-making urchins, wheeling-dealing peddlers, or day-wasting gentles, the townsfolk were all enamoured of their new hero-dame.  Nevermind that hers was a house of a different province entirely.</p>
<p>To be sure, it had come to light that the Lady Emilie was no longer of House Mernesse, but by the grace of Central, she was given both land and a fresh slate for her new start.  “Valenius” was her surname now, the title of baroness withal.</p>
<p>Emilie Valenius.  The very portrait of the 5th.  Ask of that Order, and hers is sure to be the likeness first upon the mind, for that certainly was the case with all the local folk I’d approached.  Curious then, that the Aureola of the 5th herself desired none of this fame.  Such an appetite the fates have for irony, if naught else.</p>
<p>‘Twas then…</p>
<p>“&#8230;Hm?”</p>
<p>A window.  That of a shop I happened by in the course of my thought-filled stroll.  Through the linty pane did I spy… <i>it.</i></p>
<p>And so, like a petal drawn in by a lusty gust, I entered the shop.  Miscellanies and curios were on full display, but what hooked mine eyes laid further within.</p>
<p>There.  Lounging upon a counter.</p>
<p>“My, what have we here…?”</p>
<p>A cat.</p>
<p>Always had I a love for adorable things.  Fitting, wouldn’t you say?  I <i>am</i> a girl, after all.  Oh, but for darling critters, what fondness!  The cat in question—how it strummed my heartstrings so!</p>
<p>A closer look revealed the feline’s wizened character.  From its body came nary a budge; only when its glower of a gaze met mine did it turn its whiskers away.  And most asudden, at that.</p>
<p>Ah…  What boldness.  What <i>pomp.</i>  In port and appearance both.  Irresistible, I tell you!</p>
<p>And so, resist I did not.  Mine unsteady hand reached forth, all for a chance to pet the feline’s fuzzy pate.</p>
<p><i>“Hhyehh!”</i></p>
<p><i>“Aah—!”</i></p>
<p>My hopes, dashed by a lash of its paw.</p>
<p>“Be not so glum, mademoiselle.  Come rain or shine, the felines never fail to find yours a foul company.  ‘Tis certain!” prodded Francis.</p>
<p>Words that bit with much truth.  ‘Twas ever my fate to fawn for critters and be not requited in kind.  Just as cats would punch were I to pet them, so would pups flee upon meeting mine eyes.  The winged ones, too, ill-took to me, billowing their feathers affrightedly whensoever I drew near.</p>
<p>My shoulders sank.  <i>“Haa…”</i></p>
<p>Oh, why…?</p>
<p>‘Twas my wish but to caress the precious thing…</p>
<p>“This one please, guv’nor.”</p>
<p>From beside my pitiable self: the bright voice of a young boy.  In his palm was a vial of rust-red pomade, presented forth to the storekeeper.</p>
<p>“Right, what we’ve got ‘ere, ey?”  Then, after a quick but puzzled look, “Why, that’s some pomade, lil’ master!  Not fer a wee lad like ye t’buy, no no!”</p>
<p>“I-it’s for me mum!  She’s off to work ev’ryday, she is.  Till long past sundown…” the boy explained with increasing gloom.  “This pomade’s the proper present, innit?  For a workin’ woman like me mum?”</p>
<p>Indeed, it very well was.  Distilled from the fragrant ixora flower, the pomade was a trendy pick for women of business.  Albeit one scarce worth a pretty coin.  Though for his age, the boy surely must’ve pinched many a penny to afford it.  And as if to confirm my measure, gripped in his other hand was a smattering of coppers, also presented forth.</p>
<p>“Here we are!  I founds it!” came a shout from behind.  ‘Twas a wide-girthed, coarse-throated man who, with not an inkling of reserve, snatched the vial from the boy’s palm.  “This—what’s it worth then, eh guv?”</p>
<p>“That be the last o’ its stock, ser,” answered the storekeeper.  “Might I int&#8217;rest ye in a diff’rent one?  This lad ‘ere was right ‘bout t’buy it, see.”</p>
<p>“Come now, good guv!  You knows me office well ‘nough: I purchases from the marquis’ purse, I does!”</p>
<p>Ah.  An errand runner.  For who else but the Marquis Norden himself.</p>
<p>Not against the very master of this land and his underlings could this unassuming shop do aught but fold.  And so was the storekeeper gripped with silence, the up-looking boy with sorrow, and the scoundrel of a runner with self-importance.  Indeed, he seemed the exact sort to derive glee from playing the lord himself, what with those lips of his simpering crookedly.</p>
<p>“Let the lad have his way, won’t you?” I cut in.  “Hand that back this instant.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Eh?  What’s this, now?” the overgrown errand-boy hissed, leaning close.  “Wax stuff’d your ears overmuch, love?  I’m a man of the marquis, I says again!  The lord Marquis Norden!  Me vaunted master!”</p>
<p>“And I say again: hand the poor princeling his pomade—and some coin, while you’re at it, for the shopkeep’s trouble,” I returned, till mine eyes narrowed, inspired anew.  “&#8230;Nay.  Empty your pockets, lint and all, and wend off on your merry way, why don’t you?”</p>
<p>“My good Lady, you sound quite the brutish brigand, if any less I knew of you,” Francis remarked, whilst firmly resting his hands upon the boy’s shoulders and turning the young eyes away.  A consideration for what was to come.</p>
<p>Violence.</p>
<p>“Hah!  Your crowing’s crazed, woman!” the runner snorted, ere his brows arched up as he gave my features a harder look.  “Ah…?  Well I’ll be!  Aren’t you a flowery face?  I’d say you’d make quite the mistress for the marqu—<i>ack!?”</i></p>
<p>Never had I the charity for fruitless argument.  My fist was what settled this one, whipped straight into the man’s slimy face.  Up spewed an arch of blood from his nose; down to the ground he crumbled.</p>
<p><i>“Ooufh…!”</i>  And from his gnashing teeth, an uproar.  “V-vile vixen, you…!  Raised a hand ‘gainst the good name of the marquis, you have!”</p>
<p>A hand in resistance to unjust authority, that is.  Nothing more.  Of course, no good would come from striking a man so, on account of farcical conduct.  Only, his was farcical overmuch for my tastes.</p>
<p>“Oi!” he yapped on.  “You best looks at me as I’m talking, woman!”</p>
<p>“What’s all this hubbub about?” came a new voice, this one from the shop entrance.  “Why upon Her watch must so simple an errand become so…”</p>
<p>Now at the doorway was another man, freshly arrived, as if leashed in by the commotion.  His broad shoulders implied a built physique, whilst his raiments betrayed his noble station.  And from his words, ‘twould seem he was the runner’s lord, all this time waiting yonder for the errand to be done.</p>
<p>An aristocrat—of such a status that ill-suffers the humble confines of a trinket shop.</p>
<p>High hubris, then.  Fitting for the master of this land.</p>
<p>“M-Marquis!  M’liege!  This woman—”</p>
<p><i>“This woman…</i> is the hero-dame herself,” spoke the vaunted marquis as he slid his bleak glance to me.  “Dame Mareschal of the 1st Chivalric Order—Your Mightiness, Lady Estelle Tiselius.  Quite the pleasant surprise, I must say.”</p>
<p>Up at me was the runner’s gaze now wide.</p>
<p>“Wha… Ti-<i>Tiselius!?</i>  Good heavens!”</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>“Oh, perish the thought,” the marquis scoffed.  “No soul of my stead, be he sire or servant, should deign to divest a child so.  Should he, my good yeoman?”</p>
<p>“No-n-n-not at all, m’liege!  S-s-sssorry I am, tr-truly!”</p>
<p>With but an unblinking glare from the lord of Norden, the runner was made to run.  Out the shop he flew, tripping over himself along the way.  ‘Twas a fact that from his bloody-nosed and sweaty-cheeked face was wrung an apology to none other than myself.  Misplaced, unfortunately, but ‘twas clear that such a sorry sight would’ve been unsought by the true victim: the boy.  And so I let it be.</p>
<p>“My dear Mareschal,” the marquis turned to me, “might I know your pleasant business here on my streets?”</p>
<p>“Central missed me, it seemed,” I answered with no warmth.  “The chore’s done with, and so am I bound for home.  But then I thought to stretch my legs here, along the way.  You won’t mind, I hope, dear Marquis?”</p>
<p>“Oh, not at all, Your Mightiness.  This is a merry meeting, indeed,” began his doublespeak.  “Already an honour and pleasure both to see you at the royal capital, but never could I have imagined a chance to entertain you here in my own lands.  Yoná is ever playful with Her lambs, hm!  To Her, a thousand thanks, for I may now boast to my subjects tonight of meeting here the kingdom’s keenest blade.”</p>
<p>From his words: a noisome whiff of suspicion at mine unexpected visit.  This marquis—more beguiling and cutthroat again than most of his ilk.  He was a lion, ever sniffing for the unguarded nape.  The iron-stench of a bloodbeast was neither lost to Francis’ own faculties, for his vigilance was reared as he stood guarding the little boy.</p>
<p>Theirs was a long-reeking smell, the marquis and the 5th.  To mine own nose, right from the outset.  Why, make absent the matter of the recent exile, and I would’ve meant no less to seek out the source of their stench.</p>
<p>“Your praise is profuse, Marquis.  But I’d say of late, blades sharper still have freshly left the anvils of Central,” I returned.  “If I’m to speak my mind, such praise is best left to said steel.”</p>
<p>“One by the name of Emilie Valenius, perhaps?  Indeed, the Lady has cut quite the impression, to be yielded a fief all her own at so young an age.  Yet her edge is… soft, untempered; I should say that amongst blades of late, its bite is blunt compared to your own heroic hew, Lady <i>Estelle Tiselius.”</i></p>
<p>A honeyed eulogy, sweet only to the undiscerning ear.</p>
<p>“Oh, my oh my, pardon!  It was not the 5th’s mareschal you meant?  Allow me another guess, then, of one more mete with your measure.”  There: a grin upon the dread visage.  “&#8230;Ah, yes.  What of <i>Brandt?</i>  Bo Brandt!  Now there’s a beau of a blade!”</p>
<p>“Nay, good Marquis.  I did not <i>mean</i> anyone in particular.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?  Well.”</p>
<p>Terseness, followed by a lidless stare upon mine own, prowling for some secret or fault to lunge upon.  The passing silence, tingling with barbs and briars between us, occupied but a moment, till at last the marquis’ lips cracked open again.</p>
<p>“Oh, the hour waxes.  Business calls; I must be off.  Fare you well, my fair Mareschal.  May we meet again upon another pleasant day,” ended the marquis, ere stepping to the counter.  “Shopkeep, a pittance for the pandaemonium.  May it suit your purse.”</p>
<p>From the marquis’ hand: a gold reugol, now glimmering on the dusty counter.  Then did he take his leave.</p>
<p>Were it a coin of respect, he would quickly find himself a man bankrupt.  Yet ‘twas the aching truth that the marquis brought no shame to his robe of dignity: to neither the storekeeper nor the boy would he dare wield vain retribution.</p>
<p>This I reckoned as the unsought encounter was brought to its well-sought close.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>“H-ha-hallo!  Good miss!”  A bright greeting from the bright-eyed boy.  We were all yet in the shop, now liberated from the lord’s company, and up to me did the little lad look.  “M-might you t-truly be the Lady Estelle Tiselius, pray tell!?”</p>
<p>Bright indeed.  His glowing timbre was enough to leave me abashed.</p>
<p>“That I am, my little prince,” I affirmed, bending down to meet his gaze.  “You well-know my name!  ‘Tis an honour.  And a gladdening one, at that.”</p>
<p>“Let his kindness be neither forgotten, mademoiselle,” Francis observed.  “‘Miss’, he said!  Though you scarce match the meaning.”</p>
<p>“And your mouthing scarce matches the moment, <i>Francis.”</i></p>
<p>How blunt, this butler!  I am <i>yet</i> a miss.</p>
<p>‘Twas then, in the midst of mine inner indignation, that the boy spoke again.</p>
<p>“M-may I ask somethin’ o’ you, m’lady?”</p>
<p>“You may, my little master,” I said gently.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Have you really got no one in mind?  When you said what you did?”</p>
<p>Ah.  My prior words to the marquis.  Children certainly are keen of ken at the most unexpected of times.</p>
<p>“Oh!  Sorry!  I-I didn’t mean to pry.  Just, it tickled me fancy when I heard your words.  You sounded mighty taken with somethin’… or someone.  I’d like to know more o’ this special soul, if it pleases m’lady.”</p>
<p>“‘Twould very much so, but I’m afraid ‘tis a name you know nary a letter of,” I answered with some heaviness.  “But of names, I should hear yours, my love.”</p>
<p>“C-Connie!  Me name’s Connie!”</p>
<p>“‘Connie’?  My, a charming name you have, Connie!  More charming again that you keep your mother so dear in your heart.”</p>
<p>“Me mum… she works hard ev’ryday; I thought to give her a little somethin’, you know, to put a seldom smile on her face,” he described, before a thought happened.  “Oh, that’s it!  Would you mind if I ask’d one more thing, m’lady?”</p>
<p>“Not at all, dear Connie.”</p>
<p>The boy’s shoulders rose as he took in a deep breath, as if to muster up some courage.</p>
<p>Then, with earnestness in his eyes, “I want to be big an’ strong when I grows up!  So me mum shouldn’t worry ‘bout me as much.  But… I, er… I don’t know how, see.  Maybe you can teach me somethin’ secret, m’lady?  So I can be strong like you someday?”</p>

<p>How many times is it now?  That mine ears have met this question?  More than I care to count, truth be told.  Thus do I have a reply always at the ready.</p>
<p><i>‘Have conviction.  Have humility.  Learn from others.  Apply thyself.’</i></p>
<p>A crafted answer for the thousand same questions.</p>

<p>“&#8230;You mustn’t lose.”</p>
<p>“Ohh?”</p>

<p>But not today.</p>
<p>The one most mete with my measure.</p>
<p>The one most deserving of decoration.</p>
<p>My words with the marquis had indeed sparked the memory of that ‘special soul’, and ‘twas perhaps the pull of Connie’s question that teased it out to the open.</p>

<p>“You must never lose.  Not once.  He who walks the path undefeated shall arrive at true strength.  So long as he loses not…” I answered distantly.  Then, as if catching myself, I looked to the boy before me once more.  “Hark well, dear Connie.  Lose not once, not ever, and strength shall duly be yours.”</p>
<p>The boyish face wrinkled with confusion.  Of course it did.  I admit, heady overmuch was mine honest answer for that spring-green mind of his.</p>
<p>“But… but I…  I can’t,” he reflected with difficulty.  “&#8230;Nothin’ goes well for me—ever, really…”</p>
<p>A sullen pall then came about him as Connie cast his eyes down, dejected.  “The strong are born so”—surely a notion branded into him from the very start, and one that immured him to this moment.</p>
<p>“Yet that matters little, Connie,” I returned, with firmness uplifting.  “So you’ve not won.  Yet have you lost?  ‘Tis not so simple.  You might be laid low, brought low, on and on, and have nary a soul beside you to say what valour you’ve shown.  But that is fine.  Rise, and give in not to loss.  Then shall you know strength—just like that ‘special soul’ I spoke of.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Oh…”</p>
<p>What silliness was this?  That slipped from my lips to drum the ears of a small child?</p>
<p>What was I?  In the wide eyes of dear little Connie?</p>
<p>“Worry not, my good Lady,” Francis whispered.  “Your words have met his heart.”</p>
<p>Gladness, if so.</p>
<p>My faith that they have.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>Thereafter did Connie part from my company, but not ere a shower of many thanks.  Out of the dustiness of the shop he went, and into the sunniness of the streets.  Secure in his palm: the purchase of the ixora pomade.</p>
<p>His mother.</p>
<p>How blessed she was.</p>
<p>But in turn, how unblessed their lives must be, that she must labour so late into the night…</p>
<p>A solace, then.</p>
<p>To know that in her heart and home both, there waits a gentle son for her daily return.  Waiting, to comfort his weary mother.</p>
<p>Not so different, she and I, working women as we were.  Only, I had none to confide in.  None from whom I might find comfort.</p>
<p>Catching myself ensnared in self-pity, I then thought to lift my spirits and treat myself to some trinket.  To the display of wares mine eyes turned.  And there, displayed upon a lower case, was a comb that piqued my fancy.  I bent down and took it to hand.</p>
<p>Here, too, my measure did not fail: ‘twas a modest little treasure, this.  Simple, shaped with care, and…</p>
<p><i>…pit-pat.</i></p>
<p>“&#8230;Mm?”</p>
<p>A touch or two upon my pate.  I looked up.  There was I met with the elderly cat, yet lounging upon the counter above, with its forepaw stretched and stroking my crown.</p>
<p>From my lips, soft laughter.</p>
<p>From the moment, some bliss.</p>
<p>“You would comfort me?”</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>
<p>I am most glad.</p>
<p>You seem long in your years, yet as wise as you are wizened.  Perhaps you’ve caught a glimpse of my thoughts?  Then I hope you’ll not mind hearing my heart for this while.</p>
<p>Though I seem the dainty damsel, I am quite strong, if I do say so myself.  ‘Tis why I’m rather given to lonesomeness at times.</p>
<p>Many are those that would lavish praise and applause upon me, just like that little boy moments ago.  Yet of those that would share some care and comfort, I have none.</p>
<p>What they have for me is awe and admiration.  And naught else.  Seeds for solitude, really.</p>
<p>What’s this, now?</p>
<p>‘Sorrow beseems not the strong,’ you say?</p>
<p>Why, even the strong are no strangers to woe.  Myself, especially.</p>
<p>I’ve saved many a soul.  In that, I take pride.</p>
<p>But who, then, shall save me?</p>

<p>Someday…</p>
<p>Someday, there shall be a soul stronger than I.</p>
<p>A soul that would say:</p>
<p>‘You did well, Estelle.’</p>
<p>A day I long to reach.</p>
<p>Words I wish to hear.</p>
<p>A soul I yearn to meet.</p>

<p>From the feline sang not a sound.  Instead, its gaze was locked upon me, unmoving.  Words seemed to flow from its elderly regard.</p>
<p><i>Leavest behind thy childish fancies.</i></p>
<p>Or perhaps…</p>
<p><i>Steelest thyself, to savest thyself.</i></p>
<p>Or even…</p>
<p><i>What ill is there?  In holding on to hope?</i></p>
<p>These, it seemed to say.  And so to myself, I said:</p>
<p>“&#8230;‘Hope’, then.  For tomorrow and on.”</p>
<p>Then did I rise again, in my palm not a comb, but a pomade of mine own.  An azure vial, brimming with the essence of blue sages, popular as a celebration for the new journey ahead.</p>
<p>Indeed.  A fair fragrance, filled with jubilation for the future.</p>
