<h2 style="text-align:center;">Ⅴ</h2>

<p>Scars of grey rose into the red night.</p>
<p>The smell of smoke—already had the Fiefguard sown fire within the first houses at Hensen’s west end.  Likely the gate defences were breached with ease, a fault of too little time to muster against the march of Men…  A march no doubt tasking its thousands of feet to Hensen’s very centre.</p>
<p>I turned.  “Berta, the evacuation?”</p>
<p>“By this hour… the homes nigh the west gate should be well-emptied!” she confirmed.  “And left in them: the folk’s valuables!  Just as you proposed!”</p>
<p>Good.  Some time was bought.  Having marched all this way, the Fiefguardsmen were surely starved for spoils.  Fair to say, theirs would be a march slowed by their own rampant ransacking and arsonry.</p>
<p>“Then the west gate is exactly where the Fiefguard must be dammed.  Lest…”</p>
<p>Berta’s brows rose.  “&#8230;Lest they flood into this very district…!”</p>
<p>The keen calculation of a war-chief.  And quick: already did she foresee the Fiefguard’s projected paths.</p>
<p>The margrave’s swine could scarce keep a straight march now that they’ve filed into their feeding trough.  Indeed, the chain of command leashing in the Fiefguard was loose at best: what should’ve been a coherent column focused on felling the fólkheimr’s heart was instead a splash of soldiers, disparate divisions now out to pillage as they please.  A hazard of a guess, sure, but if the erratic smoke plumes were any indication, I’d say the horde’s own haphazardry had well-got the best of them.</p>
<p>Hence should Hensen’s centre remain reasonably safe in the meanwhile.  But the same couldn’t be said of the other districts, where evacuations had scant time to start—districts, not unlike the one I stood within.</p>
<p>Braves were needed here, and soon, to protect the people in their flight from the Fiefguard’s warpath.  The exigency was hardly lost upon Lise.</p>
<p>“This district is defenceless…!” she cried.  “I must find my father!  To sue for soldiers!”</p>
<p>Not a second later did she set off like lightning.  Time was of the essence; the populace must be moved whilst the Men were yet mired in their own mammon.</p>
<p>“Volker and his spears are swift; already they make for the west gate, I think,” said Berta.  “I remain here, to protect this plot and await the coming of my braves!”</p>
<p>“Then I’ll make for the west gate myself,” I said, before turning to head off.  “Fates smile upon you, Berta.”</p>
<p>“Young fellow,” she called, “you mean to face the Fiefguard?”</p>
<p>I knew well what she wished to say.</p>
<p>Confront the kin of my kingdom—and what then?  Cut them down?  Me?  An ungraced?  With what?  The sword I’d surrendered at the west gates?</p>
<p>Indeed.  This fool’s path is fraught.  Fatal, even.  But a deed to be done, must be.</p>
<p>“That’s the plan,” was my answer as I broke off westward.  “But I’ll join Volker before I do!”</p>
<p>“Tread lightly, lad!”</p>
<p>With Berta’s words a tailwind to my haste, I left the languished district, full-knowing that the end of this night would find my fortunes forever changed.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>I arrived at the west end, only to come upon cliff-faces of fire.  What were once homes were now husks of blazing ash, for hardly any hewn stone had ever buttressed a hall of Hensen.  Thus was the simple spark a fell foe to this old and oaken fólkheimr.</p>
<p>“There!  In the left wing—sorcerers!  Silence them!” cried a command from horseback.  “Let not another home be torch’d!”</p>
<p>The voice of valiant Volker.  Berta had thought right: he and his spears were keen to cut off the Fiefguard’s westborn advance right at the mouth of their flooding.</p>
<p>“Volker!” I roared above the raging battle.  The nearby Nafílim fighters then fixed their fury upon me, a Man appearing anew in their midst.  But with a hand raised high, Volker stayed their spite.</p>
<p>“Rolf!  You are come!” the war-chief spoke, rounding his steed to my side.  “Would that our quickness match’d your counsel’s correctness: the western defences we muster’d too slowly.  And now we pay.”</p>
<p>“Nay, it was I who should’ve paid!  More mind to the margrave’s bloodlust!” I reprimanded myself.  “The evacuation!  Is it done with!?”</p>
<p>“Here, yes.  Elsewhere, no.  What of it?”</p>
<p>In the war-chief’s words: a yet undiminished distrust for the wayward Man before him.  But for Hensen to stand in the light of the next dawn, cooperation was key.</p>
<p>“The fires!” I exclaimed.  “Leave them to burn!  And should the Men set flames anew, let them!”</p>
<p>Volker narrowed his eyes.  “Let them <i>what?”</i></p>
<p>“The Fiefguard ill-foresees how speedily the flames spread!  Not before have they fought in so oaken a place as this!  They know only the stones of Arbel!” I explained amidst a battlefield of embers and bellowing warriors.  Volker kept quiet, training his ears to my every word.  “The buildings ablaze—they’re more a labyrinth barring the Fiefguard’s advance than aught else!  Have your braves form a deep column—draw back and let the Men give chase!”</p>
<p>Writ then on the war-chief’s face was not incredulousness, but calculated consideration: he let a hand alight upon his chin, and after a half-moment, turned to his spears.</p>
<p>“Change of plans!  Harry not the sorcerers!” he ordered them anew.  “Reform ‘round the centre!  Deep column, deep column!”</p>
<p>Volker—a commander swift of sense, a gust veering to every advantage.  His spearmen as well; theirs were movements much honed.  Likely the lay of the townscape itself was mapped in their very minds.</p>
<p>With precise paces, they spread and rearrayed themselves into a deep formation, contracting back in as the adjustment was underway.  Their ranks were now almost as filled as their files.</p>
<p>“Get back ‘ere, ye devils!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha!  Be cleansed, filth!”</p>
<p>Grim glee from the Fiefguardsmen, mixed in with rumbling hoofbeats as they galloped after the reforming Nafílim.  But their offensive would prove fangless: the Men’s indulgences in avarice and arsonry had left their formations fragmented.</p>
<p>With Volker’s warriors winding back whilst deeply ranked, only a few of the Fiefguard’s forces were in immediate position to bite at the bait that was the Nafílim flanks.  And bite they did, though their craving was quenched with woe: overextended, the ambitious Men were soon skewered by bristling maws of Nafílim spears.</p>
<p><i>“Gagh…!”</i></p>
<p><i>“Uwagh!?”</i></p>
<p>The air of battle, newly delirious with death screams.  The sights and sounds of their fallen fellows all but incensed the frothing Men.  They had come, expecting more a campaign of ill-contested conquest than a hard-fought foray.  And their sizeable headcount of a hundred-score was reason enough to expect a poor challenge, to say nothing of the fields of fire they had sown, the searing light of which had swollen their pride.</p>
<p>Indeed, they had full trust in their own triumph—an arrogance swiftly answered with Nafílim aggression.  Felled, the too-foolhardy amongst the Fiefguardsmen were now as feed for worms, an indignance ill-suffered: the remaining Men next roused their steeds and swords both, and broke into a charge.</p>
<p>But Volker’s braves were undisturbed as they dealt back deathblows.</p>
<p><i>“Gwahagh!?”</i></p>
<p>Lag-wits, laid low by a lesson in humility.  In fright and fury both, the surrounding Fiefguardsmen then pulled back their ranks to attempt a regrouping.  The ploy turned no profit, for barring them now were fiery billows of their own making.</p>
<p>“Captain!  We’ve lost footing!  The fires—they trap the rear right wing!”</p>
<p>“Bloody shite!”</p>
<p>Confusion flashed through the Fiefguard’s files.  Still, the art of soldiery was not wholly lost to them.  Whipped into action by barks from their commanders, the Men immediately began fixing their formations.  A moment, just a moment, was all they required.</p>
<p>But it was ungiven: Volker was void of charity.  His foes baring their vulnerability to all nakedness, the war-chief issued his next orders.</p>
<p>“Wind-spells!  Three volleys!  Strike the front to the right flank!  Fire!  Fire!” Volker vociferated.  “Horse-braves, to me!  Charge!  Cha—rge!”</p>
<p>Time and place were pounced upon to perfection.  In their self-inflicted chaos, the Fiefguard’s right half was left conspicuously shallow, a brief opening into which were poured the spells of the Nafílim.  Men were marred and unmade, as mercilessly did Volker and his cavalry next crash into their foes’ cracked columns.</p>
<p>“Draw back, men!  Draw back!”</p>
<p>There: the Fiefguard regiment began retracting its pruned and panicked ranks.</p>
<p>“Hold!” the war-chief shouted.  “Let them run!  We regroup!”</p>
<p>His mind knew enough caution not to commit his foes’ same mistakes.  His braves cut off the chase and reformed—a sound decision.</p>
<p>In spite of its success, Volker’s contingent could not compare to the Fiefguard’s numbers.  Fighting in this flaming battlefield, harrying the Men into awkward corners, barring their advance with deeply formed ranks—these stratagems gave the Nafílim advantage enough to overcome the contest of quantity.  An advantage dearly lost were they to wantonly pursue the scrambling Men into more open spaces.</p>
<p>No force of many files can so keep an unmanacled march through flaming, Byzantine corridors.  Much consideration must be given to where clashes might occur.  Like a well-tended garden, the battlefield must be as a thing curated and configured with all care.  The Fiefguard stand to win by numbers, thus numbers must be made the source of their undoing.  This was Volker’s thought, his way to victory.</p>
<p>But it was a way hard-trod.  Having little, the Nafílim here were tested to their limits, and their faces showed it.  All well and fine to fight back a larger force with tactics deft and devious, but to <i>keep</i> the fight with dwindled numbers dwindling on—that was a weight overbearing upon the braves’ few shoulders.</p>
<p>And that’s to say nothing of the folk they must defend.  To leave the west end would tempt an end of a different sort for the districts yet to be evacuated of its citizens.</p>
<p>I approached the war-chief, having witnessed the winding back of the Fiefguard… and knowing it was soon that they would return for a reprisal.</p>
<p>“Your braves battle well, but I can’t see them lasting long—not with these numbers,” I warned Volker.</p>
<p>“I dread the same,” he confessed.  “But there is hope: reinforcements come as we speak.  Hold here, and victory vanishes not from us.”</p>
<p>Tidings a sweet solace to the ears.  Numbers were these Nafílim’s most glaring shortcoming.  Should it be shored up, they well-stood to smite the Fiefguard full-sore, enough to send the Men hence from Hensen’s sight.</p>
<p>I looked to where such reinforcements might come, till my eyes caught a distant glimpse of a Nafíl, collapsed and unconscious before an unburnt house.  One of the smallfolk, it seemed, one too late in vacating the area.</p>
<p>To the poor soul I ran, breaking away from Volker’s contingent.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>Across the embattled townscape I sprinted, clearing fences and cutting through the thoroughfare before arriving at an unburnt block of houses.  My destination: a Nafíl lying limp upon the dirt.</p>
<p>Quickly I rounded by, finding him a fellow greyed by a great many winters.  Kneeling down, I helped him off the ground…</p>
<p>“Fates be cruel…”</p>
<p>…only to feel no life in him.  His head drooped back, baring a throat slashed redly through.</p>
<p><i>“Hwoah!</i>  ‘Allo!  Now ‘ere’s a surprise, yea!”</p>
<p>A yelp from within the nearest home.  Out of its rammed-in doorway then issued a squad of soldiers: five figures, each enrobed in reams of silver armour, which cast cold lights from the far-off fires.  And their faces bore features familiar to my eyes—Ebbe’s men.  Though not amongst them was the vice-commandant himself to be found.</p>
<p>Fast in their fists were handfuls of fineries: purses, pendants, and what seemed a comb of agate.  Trinkets and treasures, all wrenched from the very home they quitted.  And the elderly Nafíl in my arms: its former master, maimed upon meeting them at the foyer.</p>
<p>A sneer toothily glinted from the middlemost—and youngest—of the men.</p>
<p>“Well!  If it ain’t the Commandant!  Wot’s yer arse reekin’ ‘bout all th’way out ‘ere, eh?”</p>
<p><i>…Karl.</i></p>
<p>Cantankerous, conniving Karl.  That grime-teethed grin of his was as unfading as a filth-stain upon a long disused latrine.</p>
<p>I let rest the coldending corpse and rose, requiting Karl’s question with a scowl.</p>
<p>“You fort-men are awfully far from your fort.  I would hear why,” I sternly said.</p>
<p>As I should.  Standing guard at Balasthea was their given charge, not marching along with the likes of the margrave’s men.  To leave their post so capriciously was an action I’d forbidden more than once.</p>
<p><i>“Non non!</i>  Me lips ask’d first,” Karl wagged his head and finger both.  “Wot <i>ye</i> be doin’ out ‘ere in this shite-shire, eh?  Actin’ Commandant <i>Rolf Buckmann!”</i></p>
<p>My eyes narrowed at him.  “Your commander asked you a question, Sergeant <i>Karl.</i>  You <i>will</i> answer at once.”</p>
<p>The youth yielded a full-mouthed sigh, next taking up a tinge of theatrics in his demeanour.</p>
<p>“Oh, ye bastard o’ a Man,” he said, shaking his head again.  “Can scarce find a kindred spirit ‘mongst us, so ye came crawlin’ ‘ere, all t’sell yer soul t’these devils, ‘ave ye?”</p>
<p>“‘Soul’ be a profanity upon your lips, Karl.  I see the sins you’ve savoured here,” I countered, then pointed to him.  “That agate comb you clutch… it is a gift from a Nafílim husband to his wife, a commemoration of fifty winters endured together.  That husband is now this very corpse—cut down by the <i>devil</i> before me.”</p>
<p>From Karl’s throat, a false gasp.  “Ah… so <i>thass</i> why.  Well-explains the nanna’s wild weepin’&#8230; when I filch’d it from ‘er fingers!  Ahah!  The devils!  <i>Commemoratin’!</i>  …Makes me vomit, it does.”</p>
<p>My own fingers rolled fast into fists, quaking along with my clenched teeth.  The wife, too, was dead, then—another corpse added to Karl’s nefarious count.</p>
<p>The youth himself hung a corner of his lips even higher upon spying my spite.  A glee also glimpsed on the faces of the other four.</p>
<p>“Oy, ‘e’s lost it, lads.  ‘E really ‘as.  Methinks ‘e were misbegot’n—shat out o’ th’wrong mam, ‘e were,” Karl sighed, before flinging his own sword down at my feet.</p>
<p>I gave it but a glance.  “What farce is this?”</p>
<p>“Farce?  No.  A <i>fight.</i>  Come on, Commandant.  ‘Ave at it.  It be yours,” he coaxed.  “I’m Karl, Yoná’s blade ‘gainst these wicked Nafílim devils, an’ a proud crusader well-gilt in honour—honour ‘nough not t’wag swords with a swordless Man, even were ‘e an ungraced good-fer-nothin’ like yerself.”</p>
<p>The Ebbe-brutes whistled for their wunderkind, whose lips were crooked with a self-content simper.  Indeed, his was a face drunk with foul justice, fair only to himself and his fellow lambs.</p>
<p>Sickened by the sight, I took up the sword, only to toss it back to its master’s feet.</p>
<p>“&#8230;The sheen of this farce has faded little.  You’re but a choirboy, Karl.  One costuming a crusader, come to plunder common curios as though they be relics for your toybox reliquary,” I retorted.  “You know very well I’ve no odyl of my own.  A vauntless victory is all you’ll savour from one whose sword scarce reaches that silver armour of yours.”</p>
<p>“Oh… thass right.  Yoná <i>save</i> me, I misspake.  Ye <i>was</i> good fer somethin’, wasn’t ye, Commandant?” Karl coyly cooed as he came close.  “Good… fer rousin’ me <i>veins!”</i></p>
<p>His fist flew fast at my face.  I flung forth my arms, damming the assault, but not the burst of odyl that followed, for Karl and his kinsmen were all of them bedight to their fingers and toes in silver.  An ill-fortune that found me blown clear back.</p>
<p>Into the ground I crashed and tumbled.  <i>“Gagh… hhah…!”</i></p>
<p>“‘Nother question fer ye… ye cockless cock-’bout,” Karl continued, strutting his way to me as I laid in a daze.  Nearing by, he bent down and pulled me back up by the hair, bringing my face close to his sputtering mouth.  “Wot props up that pride o’ yers, hm?  I haven’t got th’noggin’ to understand why, Commandant.  Really, I ‘aven’t.  Why act so ‘igh an’ mighty?  When yer as mild an’ meek as a limpin’ <i>pauper!?”</i></p>
<p>An unmitigated jab, driven straight into my abdomen.</p>
<p><i>“Gwahh!!”</i></p>
<p>Through my bent body: blasting and bursting odyl.  Through my mind: seeming sensations—as alien as they were ill—of my organs whipping about inside.</p>
<p><i>“Gh… ahgh…”</i> I gagged, yet in Karl’s grasp.</p>
<p>“See wot’s sheath’d at us hips, eh Commandant?  <i>Swords.</i>  Ye spots us sportin’ ‘em plenty o’ times ‘fore, yea?  But ‘ave ye swung one, hm?  Ever?  Even once?” the youth spat on.  “Us soldiers, we swings it fer practice on th’weekly, we do.  Ooh, I wishes ye knew wot a right <i>pain</i> in the arse it be, practice!  Oooh, I <i>wishes!”</i></p>
<p><i>“Aungh—!”</i></p>
<p>Next: an upcutting strike into my chin.</p>
<p>Once more into the air I flew, falling into the dirt nape-first.  My brain rattled.  My vision jolted.  Through its flickering field was the shadow of Karl’s hand, reaching in to snatch my dishevelled hair again.  With a yank, I was pulled up to my faltering feet.</p>
<p>“Ye be but a guppy in this pond o’ piranhas!” Karl’s voice echoed viciously.  “A guppy, spittin’ on ‘ow we fights!  Fussin’ o’er th’fort’s rules!  Railin’ on us whene’er we sallies!  Stealin’ ‘way ev’ry dear chance o’ battle brought to us laps!  But then ye gots th’gall t’jump pond, in t’this pool o’ devilfish!  A mistake o’ a Man!  ‘Ere t’meet an’ mingle with the <i>enemy!”</i></p>
<p>Gripping me still, Karl let loose a hail of fists into my face.  The silvered knuckles crashed into its every corner, whilst crunching cracks—sounds most unsettling—cackled from my cranium.  In the course of it all, through my brain shot crests and swells of odyl, each pluming out the back of my skull.</p>
<p><i>“Kha… huahh…”</i></p>
<p>The fists fell silent.</p>
<p>My sight seared with stars.  My mind melted into mud.  My breaths reduced themselves to naught but bated and broken huffs.</p>
<p>“I’m right tired o’ ye.  Right an’ proper tired.  But not just me.  Us lads o’ Londosius—no, us <i>Men.</i>  Us <i>lamb o’ Yoná.</i>  Yer naught but an unsought burden ‘pon us shoulders, Commandant.  Sinful, an’ more ‘eavy than ye’ve got ‘ny right t’be,” the youth kept hissing.  “Ye could’ve done a mite good, ‘ad ye sat still in a corner somewhere.  But if ye’ve got th’ballocks t’get in us way, well… <i>get ye gone,</i> I says.”</p>
<p>Karl’s blurred form turned back to his mates.  Their distant faces nodded knowingly.  The youth returned the gesture.</p>
<p>His cold grip next dragged me through the dirt, taking me to the side of the ransacked home.  There awaited a well.  The young hellion then hoisted me up by the hair once again, and with his free hand, seized my jaw.</p>
<p>Those eyes of his, wide and unblinking, stared daggers into mine.</p>
<p>“Piss off,” he spat flatly.  “An’ don’t ye go beggin’ Yoná fer a ticket back—ever.”</p>
<p>With sudden action, many hands heaved my listless body over the lip of the well.  A push, and there came a great rush of air all about me.</p>

<p>Down through the well I fell.</p>
<p>Black waters slammed against my ears.</p>
<p>Into the lightless depths I sank, sensing all sound sail away from me.  A numb thud bounced through my body—another splash from above.  The bucket seemed to have followed me, cut loose by Ebbe’s lacqueys.</p>
<p>And with it, my means of escape.</p>
<p>Not that any witness might’ve spied any strength left in me for the deed.  But I suppose those men were nothing, if not thorough in their cruelty.</p>
<p>Thorough in stopping Yoná’s spurned offspring from setting another foot upon Her beloved lands.</p>
<p>Thorough in keeping this repugnant apostate from crawling out of his cold cage.</p>

<p>A fitting grave for a dreg unfit.</p>
<p>And so, down and down into its deep and undulating dark I drifted.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>Berta.</p>
<p>Child of the Víly clan.</p>
<p>And a war-chief besides, cherished by soldier and civilian alike.</p>
<p>For cheer was ever hale in her, and mirth missed nary a moment upon her mien.  And with wit never wanting, Berta was indeed a bedrock to the rank and file, to the fair and the frail, to the youth and the many-yeared.</p>
<p>One could say this lack of coldness and cunning made for a war-chief without wherewithal.  But in Berta, there was also boundless strength.</p>
<p>Strength enough to affright the frontlines with wild and whirling hammer-fury.</p>
<p>Strength enough for the peers and pawns of her pennon to see in her a beacon of courage, corroboration, and camaraderie.</p>
<p>Thus was she worthy.  As a warrior.  As a war-chief.</p>
<p>And as well, a mother.</p>
<p>This, none could doubt.</p>
<p>For whilst the blessing of childbirth was unbestowed to her, Berta was mother to many a motherless child.  Oh, indeed.  What many they were.  Hensen was hard-lived, home to those harried by war, of whom not few were little children lost of all parentage.  But Berta gave them hope.  A smile to look to.  A love to soothe their loss.</p>
<p>They were all of them like faeries, fast in flocking to and frolicking about their minding mother.  And to them would Berta lend both ears, always with a bent most benign.  She was sure to scold them whensoever they crossed a line, but the stringency was more surely followed by an embrace—one bountiful in its rounding reach, for rotund was Berta’s girth, and with ease could she invest the many little ones in her arms.</p>
<p>Ah, yes.  What warmth they knew.  What solace.  What surety.</p>
<p>But it was the unbent truth that Berta’s was a past wholly unbrightened by her unbreakable smile.  Few realised it.  Fewer still knew of it.</p>
<p>A time when she was twenty.  A time when she walked the warrior’s way, a battler in a battalion under the Vílungen banner.</p>
<p>A time when she was with child.</p>
<p>Blessed, she took leave from the frontlines.  A visit to her home village was in order, for respite, for familial revelry.  Her husband was to follow soon after, busied as he was with leading the battalion.  Thus did the newly expectant mother make her way home without companion.</p>
<p>It was then that, not more than a day after her arrival, the sword-bearing sons of Londosius thought to pay a visit of their own.</p>
<p>No Nafíl foresaw the assault.  Berta’s hamlet was humble at best.  An abode bereft of all riches.  What worth could the eyes of Man espy in its penury?  The future war-chief knew not, and thus thought the trip an untroubled one.  How fickle, how hounding, trouble.</p>
<p>But the Men themselves thought much the same.  Theirs was an ill irony in finding amidst the folk of the far-off hamlet whom but a hammer-wielding warrior of a woman.</p>
<p>Oh, the woe they knew.</p>
<p>Their blades barked much, but bit little against the girth of Berta’s battlehammer.  And whensoever the warrior swung its smiting head, the partisans of Man would be sent sailing through the air like shreds of paper given to a gust of wind.</p>
<p>What boundless strength there was in Berta.  Many amongst the Men had their heads unmade.  Many more were soiled in misery and mortification.  But such strength was cut short by cunning.</p>
<p>A blade.</p>
<p>A keen, flesh-famished blade, held to the neck of an innocent.</p>
<p>But of course Berta would stop.  The village was small.  Everyone knew one another.  Everyone was friend and family both, from birth till deathbed.  And so was each and every villager a valid hostage to be leveraged against the gracious Berta.</p>
<p>Clenching her teeth, the warrior wound down, till the butt of a Londosian lance was brought down upon the back of her head.  Blackness took her mind and sight.</p>
<p>When next they were restored, the tables were turned: Berta found herself bound of hands and feet, with all garb and gear parted from her person, whilst the Men were anear, deep in discussion for who shall be first to violate this victim of theirs.</p>
<p>Oh, what caustic conversation.  Each uttered word an alarum upon her ears, a trampling heel upon her pride.</p>
<p>He whose deeds were deemed deficient in this raid was to defile Berta’s body.  This, the Men aired, all with half-simpers upon their lips.  It was but a game to them.  A pastime of “punishment”, for pleasure was nowhere to be found in raping a Nafíl.  No, not to these Men.  But games are games, and entertainment is scarce on the battlefield.</p>
<p><i>“Ech…</i>  Fuck me luck, ey…”</p>
<p>Grumbles shared by a number of them.</p>
<p>Giggles shared amongst the rest.</p>
<p>Shadows then crept close—the foresaid Men of meagre merit.  Their fingers formed fists and flew at Berta every which way.  She could not resist.  The violence was unmitigated.  The violation unfolded.</p>
<p>Of course, no sufferer of such molestation would fain favour lust than loathing from her offender.  Still, Berta could not stay her tears, for loath the Men did.  Loath, whilst they retched and gagged with every heave of the hip they hurtled into her.  All as the air was garbled by their glee and utter disgust.</p>
<p>That isn’t to say Berta herself was barren of charm.  No, quite the opposite, for her womanly allure was lucid amidst the many curves of her constitution.  And with a comely countenance of almond-round eyes and a mirthful warmth to boot, no Nafílim beholder could gainsay the bounty of beauty before them.</p>
<p>But Men beheld with eyes of a different sight.  Very few found Nafílim flesh worth coveting.  And nowhere was this truer than amongst the Mennish soldiery.</p>
<p>What was it in the Nafílim mien that earned Man’s aversion?  Not in their fleshly features, no, as it was a given that a Nafíl was distinct from a Man only by the hue of the skin.  Rather, the repugnance was one resonating from deep in the minds of Men.  An abhorrence they could scarce abort, as the Mennish partisans did their penance of raping Berta.  For that was all it was to them: playful penance.</p>
<p>On and on it went.</p>
<p>One Man after another, belittling Berta with their scathing barks.</p>
<p>Raping and raping, whilst roaring out their revulsion for the very act.</p>
<p>“Better to bed with a beast,” they would bellow in her ear.</p>
<p>“I’d sooner savour a sow than you,” they would hiss at her face.</p>
<p>By the end of that terrible eternity, Berta was left broken upon the ground, steeped in the soldiers’ fleshly fluids, her gaze aimless and lightless, long-spent of all tears.</p>
<p><i>“Hwah!</i>  Right glad that’s done with!” said one.  “Bless me knob, it be stain’d with sin!”</p>
<p>“Oi,” called another, “we snuffin’ this sow or wot?”</p>
<p>“Yea, have it done.  We headin’ home, boys!”</p>
<p>Cold words, more rightly said for the riddance of rubbish.  But rid they did: into Berta’s belly bored a Londosian spear.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;hh…!”</i></p>
<p>A wince from the woeful warrior.  No further motion followed.  The soldiers suited up and set off, content with their cruelty.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>

<p>In time did tidings of the attack reach the ears of the Vílungen braves.  To the harried village they made haste.</p>
<p>There, from the misery was birthed a miracle: Berta, discovered and rescued, took well to her clanmates’ remedies, for it happened that the spear savoured but a shallow wound from her flesh.  Likely a charity chalked up to the laxness of the Londosian hand that wielded it.</p>
<p>But that was where the miracles stopped.</p>
<p>The villagers—none save Berta were spared a despicable end.  The hostage, too, was hewn.</p>
<p>And one more life was taken: the yet-begotten babe in Berta’s belly.</p>
<p>That tiny spark of a life, inspiring to form and shape, was left a lifeless smear.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry… my dear…  Oh… I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>The endless lament of a mother for her child.  A child she could not welcome into this world.  A world where waited more woe for the bereaved Berta.</p>
<p>What foul chance: the Londosians at the village were evidently but a detachment of a larger force, with which Berta’s beloved had made battle.</p>
<p>And there was her husband slain.</p>
<p>A death that served a dirge for the warrior’s family.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>

<p>Her concerned comrades, all of them, could not conceive of further battle for Berta.  But such a conception was nearsighted.</p>
<p>Berta was unbroken.</p>
<p>Hatred did not hound her.  Tragedy did not chain her.  The deaths, the defilement—none of them could dare damn her heart to dwelling upon dark thoughts.</p>
<p>It was all a simple matter to her.  The warrior’s way was now a warrior’s life.  A life led to save lives in need of deliverance.  A resolve revived from deep in her bosom, where the vigil-light of her husband and child both yet burned.</p>
<p>For him would she ever be the wife he so loved.</p>
<p>For her unbegotten babe would she ever be the mother it surely would have loved.</p>
<p>The will of a woman unwhelmed by wanton woe.</p>
<p>Oh, what boundless strength there was in Berta, indeed.</p>
<p>But make no mistake: the orphans she later fostered were not themselves surrogates for her fallen child, no.  And neither were they but salves to soothe in her heart the longing for all she had lost.</p>
<p>No.  Berta simply was as she ever was.</p>
<p>A woman of warmth.</p>
<p>A presence of protection.</p>
<p>A mother.</p>
<p>Indeed, over the next nigh-score years, countless children cherished their “Auntie”, whilst she plied in parallel the duties of a Vílungen warrior.  And in that span, never did her fair smile fade.</p>
<p>Never, did she display undue disdain for the sons and daughters of Man.</p>
<p>But just the same, she sheltered no fellowship for them.  For in her heart beat the steady belief that with brumeless eyes must another be judged, regardless of his lineage or lot.</p>
<p>Of Man, such vision would see much, but vouch little for aught contrary to his callous character.  That is, till a day dawned where one of his sons set foot afore the gates of Hensen.  A son, whose sole company was his own, claiming himself acting commandant to the baleful battlements of Balasthea.</p>
<p><i>How preposterous,</i> Berta thought. <i> What be his mind, this Man? </i></p>
<p>Questions clouded her conscience.  But the mists soon dissipated, for this Man, this “Rolf”, said thus:</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;The innocent and faultless…<br />
…divested and sent to their deaths…<br />
…Families… taken and torn asunder…<br />
…These… I wish never to see again…’</i></p>

<p>Berta’s heart skipped a beat.</p>
<p>And in the dusk of that same day would she share delightful discourse with this Rolf.  Hours of amity, held in all places a paltry, parentless home, nestled within Hensen’s harrowed nest.  Lise herself was there, no less taken with the tameness and meaningfulness of the moment.  Amidst their exchanged words, in Berta was newly birthed a trust for this child of Man.</p>
<p><i>Oh, a gladness.  To find amongst Men a model of meekness,</i> Berta reasoned anew.  <i>Not all of them be cruel.  No… not at all.</i></p>
<p>The thought was a thankful one.  The war-chief felt then a friendship with this Rolf.  A bond that sooner seemed brimming with many years shared between them.</p>
<p>But then came a shift to this Rolf’s eyes and a fastness to his feet as he flew out of the house most asudden.  Berta and Lise soon followed, only to next know the reason for his unease.</p>
<p>Where he looked was alive with flame, skies cast in scarlet heat.</p>
<p>The Fiefguard were at the gates.</p>
<p>An army of Men whose hearts shared not a beat with Rolf’s.</p>
<p>The children—at all costs must they be spared the spear.  This was Berta’s mind, made with all immediacy.</p>
<p>Her hand ran along the length of the battlehammer at her hip.  And upon her face was then the fierceness of a warrior.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>The Fiefguard were as a flood breaking through the west gate.  The fólkheimr’s belatedly-formed defences had failed; more speed was mustered by the Men than any other mind could have conceived.  And now the hatchetmen were come, ready to hew and havock the waking Hensenites.</p>
<p>Rolf knew this day would darken Hensen.  But today?  Nay.</p>
<p>With lightning haste did he head westward to meet with Volker’s regiment and stop the Fiefguard from gaining Hensen’s centre.  The war-chief and his champions were well-whetted; if there stood a force apt to fence the Fiefguard in at the gates, his would certainly be it.</p>
<p>But more certain again was the lack of numbers and nimbleness at this nightly hour.  Volker’s command had no hope of accounting for every Man with a mind to foray further in.  And so it was that Berta herself stood upon a battlefield-to-be.</p>
<p>The destitute district’s evacuation had scant time to start.  Yet with Death at its doorstep, time was precious.  The folk must be made to flee.</p>
<p>“Calmly now, everyone!  Calm!  Hie to the plaza!  Help is on the way!” Berta’s voice vaulted as she guided the paupers in their panick.  “Have heart!  For Hammerweib Berta shelters you all!”</p>
<p>As she corralled the chaos, there stood about her the little orphans of five and their afflicted brother, Theo, each with uneased eyes looking up at their Auntie’s own.  For her part, the war-chief felt every second a full minute.  There was no telling when and where the Men might assail the civilians.  Any moment, and there might have arisen from the masses a swelling of screams and the slashing of swords.</p>
<p>It was in that wearying wait that there appeared forces of a different affiliation.</p>
<p>“Berta!” called an alighting Lise.  “I come bearing braves!”</p>
<p>The jarl-daughter had done her duty: in tow were ranks of reinforcements, every soul of which then saluted their superior.</p>
<p>“Chief!”</p>
<p>“Hammerweib!”</p>
<p>Though, they all numbered no more than forty.  Meagre, but a matter ill-helped; Hensen had more pressing need of spears at the war-like west end.</p>
<p>“My fighters!  Oh, how I’ve waited!” Berta sighed with relief.  “The Men come as we speak!  The smallfolk must flee; Lise, I leave the exodus to you and yours!”</p>
<p>“I’ll have it done!”</p>
<p>Lise tarried not.  At once, she went to the forgathered folk to soothe their worries and set the course for the evacuation to come.</p>
<p>The girl, though young, was yet very much of Alban’s blood.  Echoes of his acumen rang clarion in her character, and to Berta’s ears, it was a song of great solace, indeed—enough to task the jarl-daughter with escorting the defenceless droves to safety.  A charge most challenging, but unchallenged was Berta’s trust in Lise.</p>
<p>Content, the war-chief faced her fighters.  “To me, my braves!  Here we stay!  Here we fight!  Steel your hearts!  Ready your blades!”</p>
<p><i>“Ooouuh!”</i> roared the roused ranks, their morale unmarred.</p>
<p>Lise was not a step behind, delegating the braves under her own command and beginning the evacuation in speedy earnest.  The masses were moving at last.  But ten little feet did not venture forth, for ten little eyes were still locked upon their Auntie.</p>
<p>“My dears.  Listen well to Lise, you hear?  And stray not from the others,” Berta told them.  “Go on, now.  To safety!”</p>
<p>Though Theo, their elder, found little consolation.  “A-Auntie…”</p>
<p>“Mm?  What matter, my little champion?”</p>
<p>“I-I heard many west-end folk were killed,” the boy broached.  “W… will the same happen here?  Our home?”</p>
<p>“Not at all, Theo,” Berta buoyed his spirits.  “It is safe.  Your <i>home</i> is safe.  For your Auntie is <i>here.”</i></p>
<p>These words the children’s ears well-heard, yet haunting their eyes still was worry.  Of course, their confidence in Berta was uncut.  But the lots of these little ones were forever changed by the trampling chariot of war.  The return of its wicked wheeling, then, was, to them, a phantom of infinite fright.</p>
<p>The burden on their hearts was hardly lost to Berta.  And so did she sustain the smile upon her face to frighten away their fears with her familiar warmth.</p>
<p>“Be not so blue, my dears!  I’ll let the baddies lay not a finger on any of you!” the war-chief soothed them, before setting a hand upon the weapon slung at her waist.  “See Auntie’s hammer?  With it, I’ll swing and spank!  And send the scary ones on their way!”</p>
<p>“Auntie, Auntie…” came a tug at Berta’s hem, “&#8230;will you be safe, too?”</p>
<p>The unease of a little girl, her large eyes wet with worry for the war-chief, and a cherished plush bear borne tight in her tiny arm.</p>
<p>“Oh, Alma dearest,” comforted Berta, her beam unbroken.  “I might take a scratch or two.  But no matter!  Scratches do nothing but tickle your Auntie!  And I’ve taken many a tickle from you before, haven’t I?”</p>
<p>Though her words meant to mitigate the children’s unease, they were met with only more tugs upon her hems.</p>
<p>“Auntie…  Auntie, come with us!”</p>
<p>“Yea, Auntie!  Come!  Let’s run away!”</p>
<p><i>“Uu… hic…</i> Auntie…”</p>
<p>“Oh, Romy!  Kurt!  Nora!  You all!  Have heart and worry not!  I’ll stay here only for a bit, to give the naughty ones a nice lesson!  And then I’ll be with you all soon enough!  Soon!”</p>
<p>Next from their Auntie came pats upon their pates, all around, lively and with love.  Their eyes squinted with ticklish comfort, and seeing this, Berta then looked to the jarl-daughter as she returned anew.</p>
<p>“Lise, dear.  They’re in your hands now.”</p>
<p>“I’ll have them awayed to safety, each and every one,” vowed Lise.  “Fair winds find you, Berta.”</p>
<p>Words shared, Lise then ushered the children from their Auntie, and at last they left with the fleeing flock of Hensenfolk.</p>
<p>Berta broke her gaze from them, winding it west to find the fires and their many fingers reaching and writhing ever nearer.  Beneath their heated hum rumbled hoofbeats.  The fires, then, came not alone.</p>
<p>She turned shoulder back to the evacuating crowd, catching sight of the little ones looking back to her over and over again.  Berta sent them off with a smile till they vanished from view.  Then did her beaming lips bend down at last, her newly knife-edge eyes narrowing at the road whence the Fiefguard might gain.</p>
<p>The war-chief filled her lungs.</p>
<p>“Enemies draw nigh!  Defensive line, now!” she thundered.  “Look alive, my braves!  Let not a toe of theirs touch any further ground!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Chief!”</p>
<p>And what braves they were, seasoned by battles beyond count.  Swift perfection possessed their feet as they formed a phalanx; not a few minutes more, and Fiefguard faces finally reared from the flaming mirk.  The pieces were placed.  On that gameboard of a fray, the long-fought foes clashed at last.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>

<p><i>“Wooohh!”</i></p>
<p>Affrighting the air were Berta’s braves with their bellows, whilst their spears spun and struck with all sharpness.  Theirs was a prowess of much prestige: such strength shot into their shafts that a single swing held heft enough to wholly unhorse a mounted Man.</p>
<p><i>“Khwach!”</i></p>
<p>“Fear not the fiends!  Charge, men!  Cha—rge!”</p>
<p>The Nafílim fighters were certainly more war-worthy than the Men before them, but where the latter lacked in quality, they made up for in formidable numbers.  This was no small advantage: from horse-height, the Fiefguardsmen crashed and ebbed in tides of swords and spears, testing the fire of their Nafílim foes.</p>
<p>“Shog off, realmers!  Your way be shut!”</p>
<p><i>“Ggwaahh!”</i></p>
<p>The braves were as a bulwark, yielding not a step as time and again they smote back the Mennish ranks.  A single sight of them, and one could glean clearly the long years of service that gave mettle to their mien.  Indeed, what boldness that brimmed from every facet of their bodies.  And from their hearts: a determination to dam the massacre that so craved their meeker counterparts.</p>
<p>“Stop flinchin’, ye windfuckers!  Break through here, and naught more bars the way!” riled a Mennish captain.  “These devils deserve cleansin’!  The filth ‘fore us, the fleein’ ones yonder—in the name o’ Yoná, hand ‘em all Her holy retribution!”</p>
<p>Yoná’s hounds fancied themselves hunters.  Exacting extinction was their aim.  Their mark: who else but the Nafílim.  Meek or militant, fleeing or fighting—they cared not.  Mercy was a candle snuffed.  All was game.  And so did their hands itch and twitch for the spearing of Nafílim spines in their fevered flight.</p>
<p>This was justice itself.</p>
<p>But staying the sentence were the soldiers of Berta.</p>
<p>“No more than thirty o’ them, there are!” the Mennish captain cried again.  “Harry ‘em in waves!  Give ‘em not a moment’s breath!”</p>
<p>Finding full solace in their numbers, the Fiefguard gained on the Nafílim ranks.  Their captain grasped well this game: wear out the devils and the day would be theirs.  The Nafílim were too firmly fixed upon the fray, however, and failed not in keeping their file as they fought back the Fiefguard.</p>
<p>But the holy banner of justice brought such joy of battle to the Men that their might knew no mitigation.  It was then that the burden of numbers began to weigh sharply on the shoulders of the braves.</p>
<p><i>“Agh!”</i></p>
<p>“Tobias!”</p>
<p>A crack at last: through the deltoid of a brave pierced a length of lancing steel.  Berta broke forth, smiting away the Mennish spearman with a heave of her hammer.</p>
<p>“Just a flesh-wound, Chief!  I can fight yet!” gnashed the bloodied Tobias.</p>
<p>“Then fight you shall!” the war-chief nodded.  “Come, switch with Utz!  Heino!  Cover his left!”</p>
<p>“Right away!”</p>
<p>Berta’s orders, obeyed with unbroken speed.  And they proved the remedy, for whatever faults that might have tempted frailty were fast faded.  The clash continued on unabated, but in the fever of the fight, the war-chief chanced upon a strangeness in the struggle.</p>
<p>The Fiefguard were thinned.</p>
<p><i>Too</i> thinned—more were missing than did fall fey to Nafílim fauchards.</p>
<p>“Ach!” Berta bit her lip.  “The cowards!  They’ve split!”</p>
</p>
<p>This was the sole path apt to host the Fiefguard horde, yet barring their march were braves of baleful fastness.  Thus many of the Mennish number went on the move, forsaking their steeds to sneak afoot.  Theirs was a mind to slither and slide through the alleyways, that they might skirt the braves and gain on the unsuspecting evacuees.  Such was their bloodlust: rabid and all too hungry to hew the innocents.</p>
<p>“My braves!” Berta roared.  “Stragglers hunt afoot!  Go!  Find them, all of you!”</p>
<p>“Then who holds the line!?”</p>
<p><i>“I</i> hold it!”</p>
<p>“Wh—!  But, Chief!”</p>
<p>Little was left of the Mennish marauders before them: a captain and his smattering of soldiers.  Easy pickings for a lone war-chief, was Berta’s thought.  But more of her mind was on the Fiefguard gadflies now gone.  Without a full pursuit by her braves, to the butcher’s block would go the fleeing folk.  Lise escorted them, certainly, but she and her own braves totaled not even ten.</p>
<p>The evacuation proceeded assuming a rear safeguarded by the war-chief.  Were spears to spring upon it, no doubt death would be dealt to the evacuees.  And amongst them: the Auntie’s cherished children.</p>
<p>Indeed, each of their little faces was flashing quick in her conscience.</p>
<p>“Hie now!  Have not one of them near our innocents!” she goaded.  “Find them whence they hide!  Hew them all down!  Let none live another day!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Chief!”</p>
<p>“Fair winds find you, Chief!”</p>
<p>Wits of gust-wind speed and legs that lagged by not a stride: the braves broke from Berta and made immediate haste to the heart of the district, where the buildings bristled like a labyrinth.  Thus began their hunt for the hunters.</p>
<p>“You’re deserted, devil!” screeched a Londosian scoundrel.  “Think you the dam that stays the deluge!?”</p>
<p>With his sword held high and a seeming wound in his pride, the partisan giddyupped his horse and howled forth.  But fright was not in Berta: with a bend of her legs, she bound straight at the soldier.</p>
<p><i>“Ah!?”</i></p>
<p>A gaping gasp.  A misaimed sword, attacking naught but air.  Perhaps its wielder foreknew not that Berta would be so bold so to meet his head-on charge with one of her own.  But before a reversal could be ventured, the war-chief’s hammer was already a blur, its head a bull’s horn blasting into the soldier’s bosom.</p>
<p><i>“Ghhah!!”</i>  Off his horse he flew, his cuirass cratered, his breastbones broken.  And when he landed at last, it was his nape that bore the brunt of his fall.  <i>“&#8230;hck…!”</i></p>
<p>He laid there, limp, limbs in all directions.  A look at him, and his remnant fellows flew into a rage, rearing their steeds and stampeding towards the Hammerweib.</p>
<p>“Why, yo—u!!”</p>
<p>“Death ‘pon ye, demon!”</p>
<p>Screams, met with uncut calm from Berta as she brandished her battlehammer.  Swords were repelled, spears were rent, horses were thrown down, heads were blown up.</p>
<p><i>“Ggagh!”</i></p>
<p><i>“Eaakhh!!”</i></p>
<p>His comrades all were now but corpses, a reeling realisation upon the captain’s conscience.  When he at last collected himself, in his view was a whirlwind of steel.</p>
<p><i>“Hghoh…!”</i></p>
<p>The last muffled cry of a careless captain.</p>
<p><i>“Hah… hahh… hhah…”</i> breathed Berta, triumphant, but starved of stamina.  Such a toll could not be paid lightly, not even from a war-chief’s bulging purse of prowess.  And so to a knee she bent down.  <i>“Haa… ha…</i>  I’ve made… quite the mess.”</p>
<p>Not a graze marked her person, but her might was brought near its brink.  Her odyl, too, teetered on empty.  Little wonder there—her hammer-swings were many-score, with each enchanted generously with magicked judgement.</p>
<p>Would that generosity were yet a flicker in the eyes of the fates, for in Berta’s own was reflected the rank and file of fresh foes.</p>
<p><i>“Hahh…”</i> she shook her head.  “What’s this…?  More roaches… for my hammer?”</p>
<p>Before her now: a different detachment, but composed of lions from the same Londosian den.  A score of them, to wit.  But worn upon their persons were plates and arms of silver.  Berta knew it then: they were of a sort superior to the routed rabble.</p>
<p>“Master Ebbe,” said one of the soldiers.  “Just one o’ them, there is.”</p>
<p>Upon the visage of the so-named skeleton of a rapscallion, this “Ebbe”, grew a grin most grim.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>The other brutes, too, broke abeam, even as strewn about them were their Fiefguard brothers: bodies many in number, but each numb of all life.</p>
<p>“Lo, Master,” said a lackey.  “Right smash’d in, them flesh ‘an faces.  An’ wot did th’smashin’ but the ‘ammer in that there virago’s ‘ands, eh?”</p>
<p>“Virago, for sure,” Ebbe half-snorted.  “But just the same: a sow spent o’ all spirit, from the look o’ her.”</p>
<p>Ebbe’s unit—an elite platoon more rightly belonging on the ramparts of Balasthea.  Their official headcount numbered more than what Berta presently beheld, for a band from their ranks had broken off prior for some plundering on the west end.  That group was led by one Karl, whilst Ebbe himself had marched forth with the remaining troops.</p>
<p>“Th’margrave’s men try’d t’shog through this shantytown, methinks,” guessed another grunt.</p>
<p>“Ah.  Then it were this bint what bar’d their way—all t’let ‘er dear folk flee.  Folk, fresh for the culling… after we culls this <i>covess</i> from us course,” Ebbe hissed, baring his teeth and pointing a finger at Berta.  “No time t’waste!  Have at it, boys!  The hunt awaits!”</p>
<p>“Aye!”</p>
<p>The Men moved in.  The war-chief clenched her hammer.</p>
<p>“Boys… best keep their bedtime!” she snarled with laboured breath.</p>
<p>The fray was affrighted anew.  Two Men made of themselves silver streaks as they speeded in, flanking Berta from both sides.  She sprang to action with no less alacrity, meeting the rightward sword with a deflecting swing of her hammer.</p>
<p><i>“Eaghh!”</i> she groaned, her boldness blunted by the blade’s instilled odyl, large and boisterous in its breadth.</p>
<p>With too little of her own for resistance, her hands were buffeted back, the hammer along with them.  An opening; from the other side assailed another sword, keen on the cut.</p>
<p><i>“Ech!”</i>  The war-chief recoiled, saving her skin from the slash as it sailed but a hair’s width away, and next bounded backwards to break from the exchange.</p>
<p>Yet it was a hounding one, for there followed a third sword head-on.  Berta brought up her hammer-haft, halting the blade, but not its bite: from its silver length leapt a wave-breath of odyl, passing the hammer and crashing unto the war-chief.</p>
<p><i>“Gahh!”</i> Berta cried as she was blown clear back.  Though as she met the dirt, her body did not tumble and fail, but bore itself erect again, for undergirding its girth was sheer agility unjust for its size.</p>
<p>She readied her hammer again in time to contend with yet another stubborn sword.  Her head ducked beneath its sweep, her shoulders heaved next—up soared her battlehammer.</p>
<p>The uncontested counter caught the brute from below: a half-circle strike, jowling his jaw.  Teeth and bone cracked and crunched.  His maw unmade, the soldier groaned grimly, and to the ground expired to all stillness.</p>
<p>Fury flared anew upon another Man’s mien.  “Ye sty-whore, you!”</p>
<p>His sword wuthered, wild with indignance.  But its ungainliness was a gift to Berta, who brought her hammer up once more and met him straight on.  Her bull-like boldness stunned him still, and in that slice of a second, the hammerhead came crashing down.</p>
<p>The time spent tarrying exacted too heavy a toll: his skull exploded on impact.</p>
<p><i>“Aaach!”</i> howled another.  “Begone, bitch!”</p>
<p>In the same moment, one more livid sword, delivered from the left.  The war-chief wound about to ward off the strike, flinging from her hammer bone chips and churned brains.  But it was a defence endeavoured too direly, for silverborn odyl flashed forth and stung her arms to a throbbing sore.</p>
<p>The opportunity was seized: to Berta’s right ran a spear.  She twisted her body to avoid the voulge—</p>
<p><i>“Gghhaah!!”</i></p>
<p>—but made a victim of her right shoulder instead.  The silverpoint pierced and poured out searing odyl, teasing a tearing scream from Berta’s bosom.</p>
<p>Ebbe broke for joy.  “That’s it!  Let ‘er have it, lads!”</p>
<p>But Berta was defiant.  “&#8230;Hmph!  There’s naught to be bullish ‘bout, boys!”</p>
<p>The war-chief wrenched herself from the offending spear and stood away, newly poised.  Renewed as well was the vigour of the Men, to which Berta gave a grinning glare.</p>
<p>Sprawled now on her face was unfeigned fatigue.  Sweat coated her cheeks.  Hoarseness wrung her breaths.  Still, her spent stamina dampened her spirit little, which enlivened every limb and length of her body that she might bar the Londosians all the more doggedly.</p>
<p>“Her candle’s all but burnt!” Ebbe barked.  “Snuff ‘er out!  Now!”</p>
<p>Berta scowled.  “There’s… loads more wax… left… on this wick, lads!”</p>
<p>The Mennish hounds heeded their master.  One after another, they swept and stabbed with their swords and spears.  Berta bore the brunt of them all, biting back with many a heave of her battlehammer.  But her bravery was requited less and less as more and more the silver blades bit and burrowed away at her flagging flesh.</p>
<p>At length, wounds could be seen every span of her body, myriad seams from which flowed blood that blotted the earth rich in red, drop by drop.</p>
<p><i>“Haa… hahh…!</i>  Hmph…!  You boys burn… more like embers… before my blaze!”</p>
<p>But, oh—a fearsome sight.</p>
<p>For beneath the blood-veil upon Berta’s face, there glinted a glower of white, grinning and gnashing.</p>
<p>At last, the sons of Londosius began to feel themselves prey before a predator, whose mettle they guessed now to be immeasurable.  Some of their knees buckled.  Some more had a mind to flee.  But Ebbe’s scolding was quick on the catch.</p>
<p>“Panick not, you pansies!  What’s the covess now but a corpse?  Put ‘er in her coffin, damn you!”</p>
<p>Their wits whipped back in place, the pale-faced partisans then sallied forth another charge unto the war-chief.  Her grip was abating by the second, but galvanising it with the vim of her very life, Berta clenched fast her foe-smiter and flew into the fray once more.</p>
<p><i>“Woouhh!”</i>  From her throat: a thunderclap coupled to her career.  “Come!  My hammer craves a fine drum!!”</p>
<p>And the drums came aplenty.</p>
<p>Over her head the hammer wheeled, roaring down centre-wise before reducing a soldier to a smear upon the earth.</p>
<p>Then did it rise again, sailing sidelong to rend and reveal the ribs of another.</p>
<p>Next it leapt aslant, catching one more at the collarbone and stamping a crater into his sternum, and therein flattening his deepest flesh, lungs and all.</p>
<p>Once more, the mother of battle hoisted up her hammer to meet her fourth mark, but in the motion, received through her right breast a spear unseen.</p>
<p><i>“Gwh… oofh…!”</i> Berta groaned.  Blood, fresh and flesh-red, ran down the length of her chin—a savoury sight to the spearman that did the deed.</p>
<p>“Hyahaha!” cracked he a hyaena-cackle.  “This mark’s <i>mine!”</i></p>
<p>Words upon the soldier’s grave: the Nafílim hammer howled anew, upheaving from half of the Man’s too-proud pate a languid splash of skull-liquor.  Not a second, and the rest of him retired to the dust.</p>
<p>“And now… it’s <i>mine…!”</i> Berta hissed.  “You celebrate oversoon… spear-waggers…!”</p>
<p>Life-red spat from her lips, the latter bent up in a death-daring smile.  A semblance most sinister to the soldiers, for one of them then lowly let out a yelp.  The momentary cowardice painted a mark upon his head: Berta bounded unto his midst and broke the air with a sweeping swing of the hammer.</p>
<p><i>“Uwahh!”</i></p>
<p><i>“Geagh!”</i></p>
<p>Power, once waning, waxed instead, a candle crowned with a conflagration, as by its unbridled fury not one, but <i>two</i> Men were sent into the air.</p>
<p>Ebbe grated his teeth and stamped his foot.  “This filth-fiend all but clings t’this coil, brothers!  Hell hath hunger!  Have it fed!”</p>
<p>Goaded, revived grips tightened about silver hilts and hafts, and once more the brutes flocked to the fray.  It was but a sacrificial sallying, a death trip fueled by fear dyed in delirium.</p>
<p>“H-half-dead ha—g!!”</p>
<p>“Die now, damn you!”</p>
<p>A blade lunged in.  To it, Berta brought forth her left hand.  Off her centre finger flew, and into her palm the edge passed.  But there it stopped, snatched by the bone, before a hammer steeped in blood and brains blasted into the offender’s face.</p>
<p><i>“Bwarhh!!”</i></p>
<p>Eyeballs burst from their sockets, and with them the soldier’s soul as his cranium caved in.  But from beside the fresh corpse sprang another spear from another soldier.  This weapon, too, found flesh, eating deep into Berta’s belly.</p>
<p>Yet the war-chief wailed not, instead winding her halved hand about the shaft and, paying not a mite of her mind to the spearpoint set in her flesh, pounced forth to let fall her hammer once more.</p>
<p><i>“Gheu…!”</i></p>
<p>“H… hmph…”  A scoff afore the fountain of red—and a seething voice.  “&#8230;You’re all moths… too-fain for the flame…”</p>
<p>But Berta’s defiance had not gone unanswered.  Already steeping her soles was a pool of her own blood.  Cakes of red dirt dotted her legs.  And hanging out of her flank: a sword.</p>
<p>“Yes!  <i>Yes!”</i> Ebbe yipped.  “Lo, brothers!  The <i>end!”</i></p>
<p>From his sheath hissed his own sword.  And to Berta he began his way.  His mind was set, confident the curtains shall close here, by his hands, by his triumphant stroke.</p>
<p><i>“Haa… hhah… ghhah…!”</i></p>
<p>Yet, Berta drew breath.  Though her veins were dry, though her vitals were eviscerated, Berta yet barred their way.  And before the unfailing Hammerweib, the Londosians knew fear anew.</p>
<p>“Y… Yoná ‘ave mercy…” one of them uttered.  “Wot madness be this might…!?”</p>
<p>How they trembled, beholding so bloody a being.  She oozed the red, drooled it from her lips, and yet would not bend the knee before their number.  Oh, how they trembled, indeed.</p>
<p><i>“Hhhaa… aa…”</i></p>
<p>But Berta all but stood.  Action had left her.  The brink, it seemed, was reached.</p>
<p>Though, not crossed.</p>
<p>Death had yet to take her.</p>
<p>From the rotundity of her form, there flowed faintly still some respiration.</p>
<p>And then, with eyes cast down, her breaths began to form words.</p>
<p>“&#8230;I’m sorry… so sorry… my dears…” she muttered.  “&#8230;Auntie… will be… a bit late…”</p>

<p>It was mere minutes since she had last seen them.  And now, they were all she could see.</p>
<p>Tears will be shed.</p>
<p>Surely.</p>
<p>Tears for their Auntie.</p>
<p>How heartbreaking.</p>
<p>If for them, so for Berta.</p>
<p>“&#8230;But… have heart… my loves…  Auntie… will scare them away… all away… for you…”</p>

<p>“Hah!  What wickedness this churl-wife chants!” Ebbe jeered, gained closer and closer still.  Their way unbarred, the brutes followed, now cocky in their stride and crooked smirks.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Look… my dears… they’re gone… all gone…”  The war-chief whispered on.  “&#8230;Come… smile again…”</p>
<p>“Filth-fiend!  Die!”</p>
<p>To the air, Ebbe’s blade rose.  But as it did, a new fury flashed!  Steeped in blood, sweat, and tears, the face of Hammerweib Berta!</p>
<p>“&#8230;My dears!!  <i>Live!!”</i></p>
<p>Mightiness returned to the battlehammer!  Up it leapt and down it lunged, eating into the earth and wrenching from its bowels a bellow of a bang!</p>
<p>The air snapped, the skies flinched: the rallying of all remnant odyl—nay, of all remnant <i>life</i> in Berta’s body into this one swing.  A mortal manoeuvre, taught in secret, honed out of sight; rightwise retribution, wielded to the self-exaction of the steepest price.</p>
<p>This, Berta brandished.  And with it, every drop of life that might be wrung from body and soul both.</p>
<p>Thus, life turned to light.</p>
<p>From the hammerstrike, from the shattered earth, there shouted a thunderous shine, thrusting up and out in throes of palpable power most immense.  Through a stunned Ebbe and his brothers it stampeded, stamping out all sight.</p>
<p><i>“Ggeeaaahh!?”</i></p>
<p>Heat and pressure harried and pounded the Londosians.  And amidst the mighty light, their lives, too, were left to ruin.</p>
<p><i>“Aagh—!?”</i></p>
<p>Odyl, silver, flesh—all were pierced by the primal surge.</p>
<p>The sun-like light washed whitely through the scene.  A brilliance most beseeming Hammerweib Berta: ungaudy in its glister and merciful to none of its marks.</p>

<p>And with the passing of a moment, the mightiness faded unto night.</p>
<p>What remained were the remnants of the Londosian sons, all scattered about Berta, who now was bent upon both her knees.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>

<p><i>…My dears.</i></p>
<p><i>…It is done.</i></p>
<p><i>…You are saved.</i></p>
<p><i>…But…</i></p>
<p><i>…I’ll not see your faces again, I fear.</i></p>
<p><i>…Neither your lovely little cheeks…</i></p>
<p><i>…nor the worldly smiles of your later years.</i></p>
<p><i>…But those years…</i></p>
<p><i>…they are yours now.</i></p>
<p><i>…All of them.</i></p>
<p><i>…A little gift from your Auntie.</i></p>
<p><i>…Keep them well.</i></p>
<p><i>…Live them well.</i></p>
<p><i>…My dears…</i><br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>“&#8230;Berta…!  Berta…!”</p>
<p>Through a vision veiled in blood: a tearful Lise, screaming, sobbing.</p>

<p><i>…Oh?</i></p>
<p><i>…Dearest… you’ve come for me?</i></p>
<p><i>…No… don’t cry.</i></p>
<p><i>…Be not so sorrowed.</i></p>
<p><i>…But… oh, how glad you make your Auntie.</i></p>
<p><i>…Glad… to have you with me at my last.</i></p>

<p>“&#8230;Aunti—e!!”</p>

<p><i>…Lise.</i></p>
<p><i>…I leave them to you.</i></p>
<p><i>…For them…</i></p>
<p><i>…be as big a sister as you can be.</i></p>
<p>…</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p>.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>…</p>
<p><i>…Ah.</i></p>
<p><i>…My dear.</i></p>
<p><i>…Was I…</i></p>
<p><i>…a good mother…?</i></p>
<p>A wistful wondering, perhaps for the soul once set to be her own child.</p>
<p>And as well, the very last thought of Berta.</p>
<p>Upon her unmoving mien was mild mirth.</p>
<p>A smile unbroken beyond her final moment.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>Deeper.</p>
<p>And deeper still.</p>
<p>I sank.</p>
<p>Or was swallowed by the soundless dark.</p>
<p>Headfirst.</p>
<p>Down to the last lengths of the well’s depths.</p>
<p>Karl’s wrath had wrought arrant harm: from my many wounds ran ribbons of red, rising to the surface like snaking smoke, a trail tracing my drifting journey down.</p>
<p>And in the drinking dreariness, I felt in me a longing.</p>
<p>Longing, for someone—anyone—to save me.</p>
<p>I’ve come to these foe-lands seeking no fight, but honest fellowship.</p>
<p>And so perhaps a fellow of a soul might send down for me a ladder.</p>
<p>Such was my thought.</p>

<p>…And a sore selfish one, at that.</p>

<p>Selfish, if not foolish.</p>
<p>They are all of them swept up in war.</p>
<p>A war, heaved upon their hearth and home.</p>
<p>As yet, they are all of them desperate in defence.</p>
<p>A defence for dear life, for all their dearly beloved.</p>
<p>Yet here I am.</p>
<p>Craving their succour.</p>

<p>Though, there is no harm in seeking help from another.</p>
<p>It can be a virtue, in fact.</p>
<p>But a virtue best endeavoured after all other avenues are ventured.</p>

<p>Have <i>I</i> done all I could?</p>
<p>Exhausted all enterprise?</p>
<p>Fought to my final breath?</p>

<p>On and on, I sank.</p>
<p>And as I did, I looked down.</p>
<p>Down to see up.</p>
<p>Up at the night sky, beyond the stirring surface.</p>
<p>In it hung the moon.</p>
<p>A perfect circle of serenity.</p>
<p>Soundly cinctured by the well’s mouth.</p>
<p>A moon, round and red.</p>

<p>Yet the moon is only ever red as it rises from the ridges of the horizon.</p>
<p>How curious, then, to redly hang at so high a zenith.</p>
<p>…Ah.</p>
<p>I see now.</p>
<p>That is not red.</p>
<p>No.  Not at all.</p>
<p>The colour, I know very well.</p>

<p>Amber.</p>

<p>An undented disk of lambent amber, looking down like an eye from heaven on high.</p>
<p>Looking down—at none else than I.</p>
<p>And in its stare I espied sorrow, slight and subtle.</p>
<p>In its gaze I gleaned graciousness, great and golden.</p>

<p>Yes.</p>
<p>You’re right.</p>
<p>I’ve not done all I could.</p>
<p>I’ve not yet fought.</p>

<p>And so fight I must.</p>
<p>Fight, I <i>will.</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;Bwhhah…!”</i></p>
<p>My face broke out of black waters.  Lingering in my every limb were searing sensations: veins verging on boiling, blood beating to the rhythm of a new resolve.</p>
<p>Gaping and gasping for air, I looked up.</p>
<p>The well—up and up it stretched to no shorter a height than fifteen passūs.  And its width: one and a half, thereabouts.  Quite the endowed well; too endowed to endeavour an L-figure climb.</p>
<p>There’s no helping it—hands and feet, it is.  The old-fashioned way.</p>
<p>Decided, I waded to the wall and laid a palm upon it, finding stones composing its construction.  They’d been laid with care: between each, they protruded to produce ledges of little more than a quarter-digitus.  Dagger-ridges be thicker than these handholds.</p>
<p>Upon them I placed my fingers and proceeded to clamber up.</p>
<p><i>“Gh… ach…”</i></p>
<p>Wedging my nails into each tiny width, I continued to climb with all due caution.  The whole of my waterlogged weight, shouldered by fingertips hanging on ledges no broader than a lip of a bowl—a burden borne by my nails as they bit into every stone.  Blood soon seeped from the seams between skin and nail.</p>
<p><i>“Ha… hhah…”</i></p>
<p>Sharp stings seared down the lengths of both my arms, like screams above a cacophony of pain already pulsing through my body, beaten and bruised as it was.  Yet I had to go on.  And the only way out was up.</p>
<p>Stone by stone, I ascended the echoing shaft.</p>
<p><i>“Ngh… gheh…”</i></p>
<p>I’d read chronicles of accomplished climbers, who with but their fingertips found purchase upon cliff-faces most fatal.  All their weight, upon the pads of their digits—here was I, endeavouring the same, though measuring little to their mighty mountaineering.  Still, the stories resonated now more than ever; with his mind put to it, a man truly can accomplish aught.</p>
<p>Investing all vigour to my fingertips, I toiled my way up.  Every stone I seized with strength of such desperation that my fingers seemed fangs set on biting the rocks from the very wall itself.</p>
<p><i>“Khehh… egh…”</i></p>
<p>Grit and grime mingled with blood fresh from my fingers as they moved from stone to stone.  My right hand rose, catching another section.  Then, with teeth clenched, I carried myself up, and in the same motion, caught a higher stone with my left.  My right followed suit, speedily ascending to snatch the lip of the well-mouth—the exit was reached at last.</p>
<p>Quitting my would-be grave, I glanced up.  There, the moon hung as whitely as ever; my life was delivered yet again, it would seem, but not by this light.</p>
<p>With thoughts remembering amber, I clambered out into the ashy air.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>

<p>Lise lamented.</p>
<p>There, clinging to Berta’s lifeless body, the girl wept and wept to the winds.</p>
<p>At the very first light of her life was Lise forever parted from her mother.  Alban doted on his daughter all he could, sure enough, giving her what his wife might have given.  Yet more surely was he jarl to the Víly clan.  His people deserved priority, and he duly obliged.  Thus were the days many where father and daughter could not see one another, many where they could not be as family.</p>
<p>Still, lonesomeness was a lair ill-lived in by Lise, and with all the vitality of a vernal sprout, she grew fast into a spritely young frau.  It was all thanks to one woman, one soul whom she might have called a second mother:</p>
<p>“Berta”.</p>
<p>But now, too, was this most beloved mother lost.</p>
<p>Lost to time, lost of life—a breathless body, embraced by Lise as she lamented on and on, broken, bereaved.</p>
<p>Amidst her sorrow, there then came a <i>clink</i> and a <i>clank.</i>  Behind her laid the Londosian lost; a pile of partisans, out of which emerged one Man.  With an ungainly up-swing of his yet-gripped sword, he rose out of the fleshly rubble.</p>
<p><i>“Wuooo—hh!!”</i></p>
<p>A roar, leaping from the lungs of Lise!  As though the ghost of Berta’s fury yet haunted the battlefield!  Tears turned to living rage: rising, Lise lunged, a lioness with fangs of longdaggers in her hands, her soul set on the kill.</p>
<p><i>“Uoh!?”</i> the Londosian flinched out of the way, never imagining that so distraught a damsel could endeavour so swift a strike.  His high sword too-slow, the Man chanced it not, choosing retreat over reprisal.  “Bloody shite!” he shouted, scrambling back.  “Out with the bear, in with the rabid cub!  Curse the fates, curse ‘em!”</p>
<p>The biting, blubbering words of one Ebbe as he glared back unbrokenly at the fiery Nafíl.  He owed his life to his Londosian brothers, whose shadows served a shelter against the brunt of Berta’s dying light when it had flashed through them.  The attempt was not without its toll: the Man needed mending, and he certainly moved like he did.</p>
<p>Discerning that dire plight of his, Lise pursued her mark with all speed and spite.</p>
<p><i>“Eaaa—h!!”</i></p>
<p><i>“Oufh—!?”</i> Ebbe flinched again.  “Shite!  Oh, shite!”</p>
<p>Lise proved too fleet a foe for his eyes to follow.  With miserable immediacy, Ebbe forfeited the fray, tumbling as he took the fool’s flight.</p>
<p>But it was a flight too fraught.</p>
<p>The end was nigh!</p>
<p>He was lost!</p>
<p>Ebbe curled every cranny of his face in fear, knowing anew that this foe was well beyond him.</p>
<p>And yet…</p>
<p>…yet, he drew breath.</p>
<p>For Lise stood not a pace closer to him—something had stopped her steps.  A presence was reflected in her fierce eyes: figures, looming behind her prey.</p>
<p>“‘Allo!” called one of them.  “Master Ebbe?  Ye look a fish in a frypan, don’t ye!”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Have a mind for your brothers, man,” the vice-commandant hoarsely retorted, rising and dusting himself off.  “They all be dead.”</p>
<p>His words bore some weight, as for the slightest moment, the band of soldiers held silent—soldiers, each clad in silver.  They were a detachment, led by the cantankerous Karl, fresh from a plundering upon the west end.</p>
<p>“By whose hand?  Hers?” asked another soldier, eyeing a livid Lise.</p>
<p>A shake of the head.  <i>“That</i> one,” snarled Ebbe, then flicking a chin at Berta’s corpse.  “Though the lass be lethal ‘nough.  Keep your wits ‘bout you!”</p>
<p>Nodding, the soldiers began their sidle towards Lise.  Barring Ebbe, they numbered nine.  Ten total swords, then.  Ten towers of silver, soft on the approach, intent on the taking.</p>
<p>But their measure of Lise’s reach was ill-reckoned.  For hers was a forte for the fortification of self-speed, yielding fleetfootedness of no equal even amongst the valorous Vílungen.</p>
<p>Odyl flashed through the frau.</p>
<p>A blink—</p>
<p><i>“Hha…?”</i></p>
<p>—and blood bloomed in the air!</p>
<p>A surprised soldier, now with a neck scarce connected by skin, crumbled to the ground.  His attempt at flight had failed, his paling was pierced, twained by the twin daggers of a daughter in despair!</p>
<p>Lise stood above him, several paces whence she once stood but an instant ago.</p>
<p>Ebbe bit his lip.  “Have at ‘er!  All o’ you!!”</p>
<p>At his signal, the soldiers surged in, a tide of silvered Men.  Despite their skill and stature, however, none were more than pawns before the queen: argent arms fell upon the frau from all angles, each blade full-bedight with odyl, only to be dashed by a dance of daggers.</p>
<p>“Damn’d damsel, ye!” clucked Karl, spiteful of the Nafíl’s nimble bladework.</p>
<p>And so he ventured some of his own: up his silversword sailed, and down to the damsel it dived.  Yet Lise was too light-footed a foe, letting his sword slice but the air above her skin.  The longdaggers then answered silver with a scything sweep.</p>
<p><i>“Uuafh!”</i> blew Karl’s lips as he narrowly escaped without a scrape.  Nay!—upon his shoulder, a graze in his armour’s gap!  Redness coursed over silver; scorning the sight, he receded to a safer distance.  Lise, keen to keep him on the hook, primed herself for a pursuit.  But it was cut short: Ebbe’s bray broke the air.</p>
<p>“Spells!  Now!”</p>
<p><strong>“Flagrāns Vallum!”</strong></p>
<p>One amongst the Men was evidently learned in sorcery.  With his spell sung, there then sprang a palisade of pyres right before Lise.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;Ech!”</i> she hissed, startled by the heat, and shot back straightway to gain precious space.</p>
<p>Oh, precious indeed: the frau was ever fraught against the might of magicks, finding them too hounding to handle.  But merciless was the moment: another spell was spat out anew.</p>
<p><strong>“Globus Igneus!”</strong></p>
<p>From behind the fence of flames, a fireball formed and flew.  Yet Lise moved little: so brightly the bulwark burned that she could scarce espy both the speed and path of the projectile.</p>
<p>But she tarried too long.  Avoidance was futile.  The reality realised, Lise imbued her body with odyl and stood poised to take the pyre.</p>
<p>Only, too much was mustered elsewhere.  Her limbs, her longdaggers—aught and all she needed to mount a speedy assault were fast-full of odyl.  To recirculate so much to her defences in so little time was difficult—<i>too</i> difficult, in fact, for though she excelled in swordplay, never did she grow beyond a simpleton when it came to controlling her own odyl.</p>
<p>Dire, then, were her defences.  And falling upon them now was the fiery girth of the Globus Igneus.</p>
<p><i>“Aaaah!”</i></p>
<p>Flames billowed.  The air boomed.</p>
<p>Out of the ensuing smoke flew Lise, flung clear back before tumbling to the ground.  Yet many battles were under her belt by now, and she knew well to ready herself at the soonest.  Only—</p>
<p><i>“Agh!”</i></p>
<p>A groan from her lips, a fall to her knees—the direct hit had left Lise hollowed of immediate vigour.</p>
<p>His foe hampered, Karl appeared, closing in for the kill.</p>
<p><i>“Rruuaahh!!”</i></p>
<p><i>“Augh!”</i></p>
<p>Metals met, odyl detonated.  Out of the contest came Lise, tumbling through the dirt once more.  Might was missing in her: she had stopped the Londosian’s sword, yes, but not the odyl that followed, for her own was too slow in re-steeling her daggers against the magicked blow.</p>
<p>“Master!  Th’bint looks dumb t’battle magicks, she does!” Karl called back whilst grinning at the girl.  “But ‘er face be fair ‘nough fer th’fetishists, methinks!  Why,  we ought t’cage ‘er up!  An’ cash in fer some righteous reugols!”</p>
<p>“Ever an eye for some coin, ey Karl!” Ebbe chuckled.  “Pin ‘er down proper, then!  If she slithers loose, snithe ‘er tendons off!”</p>
<p>So spoke the snakes.</p>
<p>Indeed, few Men nurture carnal lust for Nafílim flesh.  But in all spheres, there are exceptions.  “Dilettantes” be their brand, though “debauchee” might be more the word here.  And to such Men of eclectic erotomania were Karl and company set on selling off the foe-frau.</p>
<p>Oh, how their spit stung her ears.  For in them was not a speck of respect for neither her nor her Nafílim folk.  Enduring their damned conversation, Lise clenched hard her teeth whilst rising to her feet.</p>
<p>But then—</p>
<p><strong>“Globus Igneus!”</strong></p>
<p>—flames flew anew.</p>
<p>A whole volley of them, fireballs arching through the dark air.  Instilled in them was nary a thought for where they might land, for as they did, humble homes all around erupted in rubble of burning red.</p>
<p>One errant orb shot straight for Lise, who leapt aside in escape.  But it was espied by a cunning Karl, who came cackling and crashing in with a craving sword.</p>
<p><i>“Hehehehyeeaa!”</i></p>
<p><i>“Eghh!”</i></p>
<p>Once more, the Nafílim maiden was made to spill upon the earth.  Here, too, had she guarded.  Here, too, had her odyl failed.  The longdaggers, then, proved a paltry protection.</p>
<p>“A righteous strike, Karl!” Ebbe squealed with glee.  “Trap the tramp, lads!  One o’ you!  Rope!  And quick!”</p>
<p>The rank of realmers approached.  To them, Lise gnashed her teeth as she toiled up to her feet.  Cornered, she cut them with her glare.</p>

<p><i>—Bvouvhh!</i></p>

<p>A rocking crash!  Something, somewhere, was sundered.</p>
<p>But as the noise resounded, so, too, did the nearest home tip and topple to ground, rousing a great plume of fire and smoke into the night.</p>
<p>“Shite!!” Karl cursed, recoiling away from the wreckage.  “Wot in ‘ells!?”</p>
<p>Lise, too, leapt off the other way.</p>
<p>And so they stood, foe and foe, the span between them barred by a burning husk of a home.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>


<p>Having clambered my way out of the well, I wound my eyes about the locale, finding Karl and his unit-mates missing from the scene.  All that remained was the old man, stilled and soulless as he slept upon the earth.</p>
<p>Taking him into my arms, I had him brought into his plundered home, and there laid him down beside an elderly woman as she rested the eternal rest upon the littered floor.  With husband and wife reunited, I took leave and looked to the west, where raged the fiercest fray.</p>
<p>In that distance, I glimpsed the Nafílim ranks more enlarged than last I’d seen of them.  It was certain: the war-chief Volker and his spears were yet fighting on, newly invigorated by reinforcements.</p>
<p>The momentum seemed set in their favour.  No worries there, then.</p>
<p>If aught was to be had, it would be for the orphans and their fallowed home of a district.  Had the evacuation went as planned?  Or were the paupers being pillaged at this very moment?  With each of the little ones’ faces fresh in my mind, I whipped my wounded and waterlogged body into motion.  Back to the poor district it was, and by the lay of the streets, I reckoned that Karl and his company had charted the same course: confronting them again was certainly in the cards.</p>
<p>But were he in the spread dealt, I knew not how to answer—not with this hand of mine, so fain as it was to fold, for it was a fact that Karl had left me for dead.  Were we to meet again, most surely would he shut the lid over my casket for good.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, I was loath to stand idly by.  Steeled yet uncertain, I set my sights to the orphans’ home and made haste through the flaming fólkheimr.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>

<p>I arrived at the run-down district, close to the children’s abode, only to find the fires having vaulted their way to this vicinity, as well.  What foulness there was in the Fiefguard… that they would lay torches upon the houses of the half-homed.  But from the sorry sight, there was some relief: the folk here all seemed to have fled—and with them, the children.</p>
<p>Onward I went, running through the rubble-strewn street till my eyes caught in the distance the distinct silhouettes of Londosian silver armour.  Soldiers—to wit, Karl and his comrades.  And joined with them was none other than Ebbe.</p>
<p>Swords flashed and flew.  There were all of them locked in combat.  Though their foe numbered but one: Lise.</p>
<p>“&#8230;No…!”</p>
<p>I gasped.</p>
<p>In sighting her did I find also another figure anear: round it was, and sat utterly still upon its knees.  The ground beneath it burned with deep red reflections—a pool of blood.  All the while, its face was bent down, just as unmoving, just as unbreathing as the rest of its body.</p>
<p>The look on Lise’s own told the tale well enough.</p>

<p>…It was Berta.</p>
<p>The war-chief was felled.</p>

<p>I’d only met her in the earlier course of the day.</p>
<p>Yet…</p>
<p>Hers was a heart of such gentleness and warm spirit that she felt more a friend of many years.</p>
<p>A friend, then.</p>
<p>Made and lost upon the same day.</p>
<p>Lost, at the end of a life led defending the defenceless.</p>
<p>One of whom, in turn, defended her memory to this moment.  With every sweep and swing of her longdaggers did Lise struggle on, hushing her sorrow as she alone shouldered the fray, all that Berta’s battle might attain to some meaning.</p>
<p>What boundless strength there was in her.</p>
<p>But a strength on the verge of breaking: the brunt of the brutes’ magicks seemed anathema to her mettle.  She could not go it alone.  Left as is, her own untimely end was soon to come.</p>
<p>Then for her: my strength.</p>
<p>Seeing the Ebbe-elites fixed on their foe, I slinked off to the side streets and rounded near, tempting not their attention.  Embering eaves, hazy heat—through sweltering alleyways I slipped till I touched upon the very side of the soldiers’ formation.</p>
<p>Ducking behind cover, I caught sight of a large cart.  Bearing it with both hands, I next spotted nigh a half-standing home, empty and choked with embers.  To it, I aimed the fore of the cart and, with all my might, sent it barrelling straight in.</p>
<p><i>Bvouvhh!</i>—a boom beat the air as the cart crashed against the rickety wall.  The timbers inside all groaned and gave: the paupers’ home, poorly constructed, could not contain the shock.  With a jolt, half of the foundations foundered; the building leant forward and failed under its own weight before spilling its burning bowels into the main street.</p>
<p>“Shite!!” someone shouted amidst the reeling men.  “Wot in ‘ells!?”</p>
<p>In my ears: Karl with his characteristic screech.</p>
<p>And he had every right to be roused, for not only had the hurling house halted the battle, but its fiery remnants now barred the men from their mark: Lise, as she stood on the other side in like astonishment.</p>
<p>Soon enough, bewildered eyes spotted me behind the rubble.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;You!”</i> Karl cried, his face fuming more redly than the roaring flames.  “Ye ungraced ghoul, you!  A corpse best stays in th’grave, it does!!”</p>
<p>The Ebbe-lacqueys all brooked my presence no more pleasantly, weaving disdain and damnation with deftness into their scowls.</p>
<p>“Rolf!”</p>
<p>And from behind the blaze came Lise’s call.  I began to answer—</p>
<p><strong>“Globus Igneus!”</strong></p>
<p>—till sent my way was a whirling sphere of flames.</p>
<p>“Damn—!” I grimaced, straightway twisting my body and bounding aside, but beset by pain wailing from my many wounds, my legs jerked and nigh-tripped themselves.  The fireball flew by as I scrambled to stability, but in its place was Karl, baring his sword for the deathblow.</p>
<p><i>“Yyeeagh!!”</i> he shrieked, eyes and nostrils flaring.</p>
<p>I whipped my hands to a nearby length of flaming lumber and, caring not for the burn, snatched and sent it against Karl’s sword.  The silver slash ceased as it sank into the wood, but another instant, and its flames were snuffed out: odyl burst forth from the blade, bludgeoning and blowing me clear away.</p>
<p><i>“Gwuhach…!”</i></p>
<p>I flew two, three waggon-lengths back before crashing and rolling along the road.  I was wounded enough: the blow left me dazed and defenceless as I laid upon the dust.  Karl came close.  His feet stamped with anger.  I laboured my way back up.</p>
<p>“Wot’s brought ye back, eh?  <i>Wot?”</i> he barked.  “I beat ye black n’ blue, I did.  Toss’d ye down th’well, left ye t’swim wit’ th’slugs.  I did me part in this damn’d play.  Why ain’t ye doin’ yours!?”</p>
<p><i>“Gwofh…!”</i> I groaned as Karl dug into my waist a twisting toe of his sabaton.  Reeling, I rolled back down into the dirt.</p>
<p>“Fancy finding you here, Commandant.  ‘O all places.  Oh, o’ all <i>places,”</i> came a grating gremlin of a voice.  Ebbe—his own feet broke close ground, and reaching down, he wrested my hair and raised me up.  But the motion stopped: into my face flashed the patina of his poleyn.</p>
<p><i>“Uwagh!”</i></p>
<p>A knee, right between the eyes.</p>
<p>Concussed, I crumbled to the dust.</p>
<p>Ebbe feigned no mercy, bashing my body with a stamp of his armoured foot.  Followed by another.  And another.  On and on, the trampling continued, each strike shouldering the whole of his hatred.</p>
<p><i>“Gah…  Ghuh…”</i> I hacked and heaved at every blow.  Left a rag splayed on the ground, I felt as though not a length of my girth escaped his grudge.  Down Ebbe looked, letting fly a gratified puff from his pale grin.  He then turned to the others.</p>
<p>“Ah… <i>magicks,”</i> he said, inspired.  “Brothers.  Let’s have the man unmade with what’s ungotten to ‘im, ey?”</p>
<p>“Hahah!” Karl cackled nearby.  “Yoná’s gift!  A fine spade t’scoop out ‘is grave with!  Ooh, I likes th’sound o’ that, I does!”</p>
<p>From the side of my sight: a silverstaff raised by a sorcerer in their lot.  Sickly upon his face was a smirk.  And upon Ebbe’s.  And Karl’s.  And all the rest.  A sight I’d seen a thousand times before.  The maligning mien of Men, always given to his ungraced son.</p>
<p>“No!  Rolf!” Lise yelled from yonder.  But as though to disparage her despair, the sorcerer spat out another spell.</p>
<p><strong>“Globus Igneus!”</strong></p>
<p>A whistle, a wind, and then—a wuthering boom.</p>
<p>I had ducked to the dirt that I might dodge the dire fires, but the spell had the same mind, meeting the ground with me.</p>
<p>Fires flashed.  Odyl detonated.</p>
<p>A most simple spell, Globus Igneus.  One avoidable given preparation.  But to an ungraced such as I, simplicity and avoidance yet yielded a deep punishment upon my person.</p>
<p>Thus was I blown to the winds, as though my body were no more burdensome than a scrap of paper.  My limbs flailed violently from the force they scarce resisted, panging with pain of nigh-dismemberment.  A horrid heat stung my every seam as I spun clear through the air.</p>
<p>But where I might’ve landed was laid with not ground, but more emptiness: down further I flew, straight into the plaza below.  Down, down into its very heart.</p>
<p>The passing gusts stopped, giving way to a thunderclapping clamour.  Through some obstacle had my body crashed; the landing coarsely cushioned, I found myself reclined yet reeling amidst plumes and piles of dust and sundered timbers.</p>
<p>Timbers, forming what was once a roof.  A roof, once an awning for an altar.  An altar, once standing silent in the centre of the plaza—facts remembered as I reasoned why I yet drew breath.</p>
<p>“Wrecking… a relic like this…” I uttered.  “&#8230;I… I’m earning curses by the minute…”</p>
<p>My attempt at humour, half-mumbled, half-wheezed.  But the artless levity gave little relief from my impending reckoning: down the steps followed the silvered figures of Ebbe and his lacqueys.</p>
<p>Nary a hint of haste haunted their strutting pace.  Pride was painted upon their simpers, buttressed by unchallenged trust in the triumph sure to come.  And come it would, for what foe affrighted their sight but a fey and fangless ungraced?</p>
<p>Indeed… the curtains were finally closing.</p>
<p>Death was come.</p>
<p>This time, I would truly have my heart run through to the hilt.  And in my eyes, in my ears, the lingering laughter of my slayers as my final memory.</p>
<p>Such a senseless end it was that loomed but mere moments away.</p>
<p>“&#8230;What a life I’ve led…  A laughingstock… for the fates…” I whispered, forcing a smile.  For when fraught, it is best to break out laughing, as they say.  Fortune favours the bold; bark at the beasts and a brilliant idea might dawn upon thee.</p>
<p>What an idea it must be, then, that so strikes asunder this gods-damned deadlock of mine.</p>
<p>Humouring away the last moments of my life, I began grimacing.  Not at my dawning death, no, but at some wicked weight bearing down upon my bosom.  To it, I turned my eyes.</p>

<p>There, amidst the rubble was a sword.</p>
<p>The same blade blackened by Gweil&#8217;ǫrr’s flames.</p>

<p>And not merely amidst the rubble, but almost embraced in my own arms.</p>
<p>The sword once set in the altar—a fates’ jest to have it jolted from its ancient slot by the force of my fall.  And oh, what a force I myself felt upon my own bosom, as the boulder of a weapon weighed and weighed ponderously down.</p>
<p>But it was a weight well-warranted.</p>
<p>For the sword was a slab of wolfsteel, stoutest and heaviest of all earthly metals, made more adamantine still by its stygian tempering.</p>
<p>Though…</p>
<p>…how curious.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;One touches the blacksword on peril of piercing pain…<br />
…and burns most terrible to behold…’</i></p>

<p>…Yet here it lies, Lise.</p>
<p>Here in my touch.</p>

<p>It was no illusion.  No fancy of the faeries.</p>
<p>The blacksword sat stark upon my person.</p>
<p>As I stared into its obsidian span, misty whispers welled up in my ears.  A strangeness; folk oft say such phenomena haunt sword-devouts.  Might I have attained to such gilt echelons, then?</p>
<p>Nay.</p>
<p>A pupil best pretends not the paragon.  And I am very much a pup of a pupil yet.</p>
<p>No…</p>
<p>These seemed less willful whispers and more wisps of hushed breaths.  Breaths bringing dawn to the benighted nature of the sword.  A nature now conceding some nakedness to my ken.  This, all, was no mere assumption.</p>
<p>This was knowledge.</p>
<p>Groundless, yes, but a knowledge as ungiving as granite.</p>
<p>Knowledge ensuring me thus:</p>

<p>I can fight.</p>
<p>Bear this Blade, and I can fight.</p>
<p>Without Magick.</p>
<p>Without Grace.</p>
<p>I can <i>fight.</i></p>

<p>What bolstered such belief?</p>
<p>I knew not.</p>
<p>But that it rang with all truth, I knew very well.</p>

<p>Ebbe and his men were now mere paces away.</p>

<p>“&#8230;I see…  This… <i>this—”</i></p>
<p>—is where my path ends…</p>
<p>…and another begins.</p>
<p>A rubicon reached after winters of wayless wending.</p>

<p>My deeds on this day are already a dagger twisting in the loin of Londosius.  But should I execute this further deed, then it will be no mere dagger in that wound.</p>
<p>For were I to take sword in hand…</p>
<p>…were I to wield Gweil&#8217;ǫrr’s bale…</p>
<p>…and <i>hew</i> my hunters…</p>
<p>…these fellows of my flesh…</p>
<p>…my <i>blood…</i></p>
<p>…then I bare the blade against <i>all</i> my brethren.</p>
<p>I begin anew this battle, flying the Nafílim banner.</p>

<p>As a <i>kinslayer.</i></p>

<p>And once begun…</p>
<p>…Once I bring both blade and body to battle…</p>
<p>…and task soul and steel to slaughter…</p>
<p>…Once I decide whom I shall defend…</p>
<p>…and to whom I shall deal death…</p>
<p>…that, is when this wavering of mine must end.</p>

<p>Along this path shall await former friends and family alike.</p>
<p>Awaiting upon battlefields, bearing banners belligerent to my will.</p>
<p>And should we meet…</p>
<p>…I must neither rescind my resolve…</p>
<p>…nor stay my sword.</p>

<p>Have I the heart?</p>
<p>To fight them?</p>
<p>To <i>kill</i> them?</p>
<p>I…</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>.</p>

<p>.</p>
<p>..</p>
<p>…I hear someone.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;I, for one, have little doubt that our very own<br />
Rolf shall be blessed with a veritable mountain of odyl…<br />
…A great service he’ll do for the Order…!<br />
…Won’t you, Rolf…?’</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Oh come, my love…<br />
…‘Twon’t do for our young man to sooner buckle<br />
under the mountain of expectation, now would it…!<br />
…Already is he prodigious in matters of book and blade both…<br />
…Nevermind a mountain…<br />
…a mere mound suffices…<br />
…for he’ll flourish just the same…’</i></p>

<p>…Ah.</p>
<p>Mother.  Father.</p>
<p>On the eve of the Roun of Orisons.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Listen well, Rolf…<br />
…No doubt the generosity of Yoná’s gift will prove crucial…<br />
…but let it not fray you so…<br />
…Of greatest account is that through the Roun of Orisons…<br />
…you commune with Yoná Herself, and thereby with Her…<br />
…birth a new bond…<br />
…Keep this in your heart…!’</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Of course, Lord Father…’</i></p>

<p>How innocent was I?</p>
<p>That so lost a lot could be lying in wait was never a visiting thought in my mind then.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;We shall smite the foul Nafílim whence they fester…!<br />
…That is our solemn duty, to which we pledge our very lives…!<br />
…For King and Country…!<br />
…For Family and our fellow Man…!<br />
…From this day henceforth till the hour of your last breath, my little lions…<br />
…deign not to forget this…!’</i></p>

<p>…Tallien.</p>
<p>And his vaulting words besides, given upon my inauguration at the 5th.</p>
<p>It was my unbending ambition then, to become a knight.  One who, with sword in hand and steel in his heart, fights the foes of his homeland.</p>
<p>To defend its affrighted fields.  To deliver its forlorn folk.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Is there meaning, then…?<br />
…In going as far as you do…?’</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;A godless dreg such as you shall not be suffered here…!<br />
…For this battle reckons both the holy and the profane…!’</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Such valour…<br />
…one most worthy of praise…’</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Were we to stay the path at all costs…<br />
…then surely the day will come…!<br />
…The day when the war is done at last…<br />
…and the Nafílim along with it…!’</i></p>

<p>…What’s the meaning of all this?</p>
<p>My life, flashing before my eyes, is it?</p>
<p>You waste your breath.</p>
<p>For I still draw mine, and plan to for a while longer yet.  Nay, I’m not laid low; I need but a moment to catch it.  That’s all.  You well-know the trick.  Pretend nigh-defeat till the count before the last, take a breather in the meantime—pugilists employ it often enough.  And I’m not one to scorn a sound tactic.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;But don’t you forget…<br />
…we owe you much for your deeds on this day, Rolf…<br />
…Thank you…’</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Buckmann…!<br />
…‘Tis the Nafílim we speak of here…!<br />
…The nemesis of Man…!<br />
…The kin and kindred of crawling beasts…!<br />
…Our sworn foes from the days of fair St. Rakliammelech himself…!’</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;No…<br />
…That look on your face…<br />
…I spies a tongue well-ready t’spew the same nonsense as ‘fore…<br />
…Some spit ‘bout staying us hands from the civilians….<br />
…Say it ain’t so, Commandant…!’</i></p>

<p>…Enough.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;You killed us…!<br />
…You kidnapped us…!<br />
…But no more…!!’</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Son of Man…<br />
…You have heeded your heart…’</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Oh…?  Then I say…<br />
…quite courageous, this commandant…!<br />
…He is but one…<br />
…yet quivers not…!”</i></p>

<p>…Enough, I said.</p>
<p>Those I’ve met.  Those in whom I’ve confided, with whom I’ve quarrelled—all of them are etched deep into my heart.</p>
<p>I know not your purpose, but I well-know the plot to this puppet show.  So cut the strings, I say, whoever you are.</p>
<p>Yes indeed, I know.  Well enough, in fact.  These thoughts, these words, all have haunted me to hell and back.  To have me sit through them again earns naught but my annoyance, you know.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Aaaagh…!<br />
…Uwghaaaahh…!!’</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Theo…!  Theo…!<br />
…Don’t give up… Theo…!<br />
…Please…!<br />
…Plea—se…!’</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Uuaaah…!  Hic…!<br />
…Brother…<br />
…don’t di—e…!<br />
…Waaah…!’</i></p>

<p>……</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;I know you…’</i></p>

<p>…Am I so untrustworthy?</p>
<p>I’ve said it once before, haven’t I?</p>
<p>I <i>know.</i></p>
<p>Of what I believe.</p>
<p>Of what path I must take.</p>
<p>Of what I must do.</p>
<p>Worry not.</p>
<p>I’ll be all right.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;please…<br />
…don’t be sad…’</i></p>

<p>I’m not given to sadness.  Nor will I give it.</p>
<p>I’m grown now, after all.</p>
<p>Grown into a man.</p>
<p>A man who keeps his promises.</p>

<p>Wait.</p>
<p>Wait, I said.</p>
<p>Where are you going?</p>

<p>It was then that Fate thought to fly from my very view.  Such flight I dared not suffer.  For never was I the sort to let slip the charity of chance.</p>
<p>Hence I reached forth to take her hand.</p>
<p>Oh, with all the might I could muster, I reached long and held strong.</p>
<p>And when next my eyes saw again, I was risen from the rubble, finding fast-bound in my hands the blade of dragon-black.</p>

<div class="wp-block-image">

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>The mere weight of it whelmed my wits.</p>
<p>I see now.</p>
<p>I <i>feel.</i></p>
<p>Boulder-like indeed, its weight.</p>
<p>This ashened shard of wolfsteel.</p>

<p>This <i>svǫrtaskan.</i></p>

<p>Yet its hilt was a harmony and a hurricane in my hands, seemingly sucking in every finger and fold of skin, that were I none the wiser, I might’ve fancied it my sworn weapon of many winters.  Gripping tight, I lifted its lightless weight and stood poised in the centre guard, training its ebon blade straight at Ebbe and his men.</p>
<p>“Oy!  Playin’ th’practised swashbuckler now, eh Commandant!” Karl shouted from afar as he crept closer.  “Wot?  Think t’wag yer wand with th’likes o’ us battle-brothers, ah!?”</p>
<p>The bayings of a boy.</p>
<p>Naught but a distraction, dim and distant from my mind as it melded with the blade.  There did pain perish from every fathom and facet of my body.  Indeed, as the moon was my witness, mine was a body beaten, broken, bruised, and blown up… but by simply instilling my conscience into the sword was all agony forgotten from my flesh: the clouds were parted, the cold stung no more, the mists thinned past all thought.  In such clarity, centred in my sight, there spanned the spike of black, the blade deeper than dusk—the breathing abyss.</p>
<p>“Ohh?”  Karl cocked his brows as he caught a glimpse of it.  “Wot’s with that brightless brand, eh?  Some stick o’ Nafílim-make?  Well, makes me right sick, th’sight o’ it!  Hah!”</p>
<p>Your sight’s what’s sick, Karl.</p>
<p>For I see much beauty in this blade.</p>
<p>Beauty—and a faint fury, mingling within the night-sea blackness of the sword…</p>
<p>…from which depths there seemed to lurk some living sight of its own, glaring unglintingly back at mine, as though to mete the mettle of its new master against an unknowable measure.</p>
<p>“Not comin’, Commandant?  Eh?  Ye scared?  Second thoughts ‘ave ye pissin’ yer pants?”  Karl crowed on as he and his comrades opened ranks before me.  “Then we shows ye ‘ow a sword be real-swung!  Eh, brothers!?”</p>
<p>“Yea!  A fico fer ye, Commandant!  Yer coffin calls!”</p>
<p>“High time we unman’d yer marbles, mud-pate!  Ye gadded ‘bout fer long ‘nough!  Now ye’ll taste th’might o’ Yoná-loved men!”</p>
<p>Straightway, Ebbe’s brothers fired forth, converging upon their ungraced mark.</p>
<p>So be it.</p>
<p>Here begins my battle.</p>

<p>Elites, left and right, reached close, but I broke ahead, setting my sights on the forward rank.  The frontal assault: a favourite manoeuvre of mine.  And with my physique, one most mete for the maiming of enemy morale—and arrogance.</p>
<p>Keeping level, I lunged forth by the singular force of my feet.  In one breath, three passūs passed by.</p>
<p><i>“Ah?”</i></p>
<p>Surprise flashed on the face of my first foe—upon which grew the thunder-shadow of my plunging blade.</p>
<p>No doubt his unhelmed head was safe inside a paling, applied by the marriage of silver and odyl.  The very same paling that protects silvered Men from scalp to sole… and one that has halted my former swings without fail.</p>
<p>But no longer.</p>
<p>With sightless speed, the soot-steel scythed through the paling unopposed.</p>

<p><i>Ghwoshheu—</i></p>

<p>—a geyser of sound from the skull of my mark.  The overhead hew halved his head, from which redly spewed the spring of instant death.</p>
<p>Thus crossed was the rubicon, flowing with the first blood of my betrayal.  The sensation lingered still in my hands, but hesitation lingered no longer in my heart, for resolute must be he who takes sword in hand and sets forth into the fatal fray.</p>
<p>Down to the ground the halved-head husk crumbled, though I sooner bounded back a ways, corralling into my sight two soldiers flying to my flank.  The right arrived first, faster by a pace.  I pelted immediately unto his midst, my hands sending shadowed sharpness slanting down upon his person.  There, the black blade bit first into a gap in his armour—</p>
<p><i>—zzsshhrr!—</i></p>
<p>—before flashing through flesh, from right shoulder to left loin.</p>
<p>Here, too, the paling proved powerless.  Here, too, the soot-steel sundered sinew and odyl alike.</p>
<p>“Y… yeuuu!  <i>Wretch!!”</i> shrieked the leftward lacquey, closing in vindictively.  His sword flapped forth, but slowness mildened its menace and blunted what edge it might’ve boasted.  For as he started one step, I finished three: thrusting myself unto close quarters, I swept forth my sword in a hewing horizon.</p>
<p>Gnashing anew at the night: the dull din of meeting metals.</p>
<p>Parted from its paling, silver is soft, fit only for finery.  Though this instant might’ve served too severe an example.</p>
<p>For <i>wolfsteel</i> was set against it.</p>
<p>The unyielding, unwieldy metal—smithed into a sword, tempered tenebrous by dragonbreath, and wielded with winters-honed strength, speed, and skill—starkly revealed the silver armour’s naked worth, as reams of it were riven asunder by the blade of black.</p>
<p><i>“Ghbrreh!?”</i></p>
<p>Through the left rib, out the right: the man, cleanly twained, twisted to his death after blowing blood from his gaping lips.</p>
<p>“W… wot…!?” flinched the remnant foes in their fright.</p>
<p>Three dead.  With them, my theory was thrice-confirmed: this sword of soot was a cinder of Gweil&#8217;ǫrr’s will.  In his time, the wyrm of yesteryore well-judged magick a maugre, a perversion stark-parted from the precepts of life.  And it was his flame that ashened this very sword…</p>
<p>…into a black blade that loathed magick no less, damning all odyl daring to touch its lightless length.</p>
<p>Hence how it hews palings with nary a pinch of pity.  Though the underpinning principles escaped my ken, there was no mistake: Gweil&#8217;ǫrr’s afgodly grace was burned into this blade.</p>
<p>Reasonable, then, that any fellow hitherto fain to wield it was met with misery.  This was a sword ill-suffering all flesh—save for the one soul ungraced with the gift of odyl.</p>
<p><strong>“Flagrāns Vallum!”</strong> cried a conjuring voice.  From the silverstaff of a soldier-sorcerer came a flicker, and then flames were woven out of thin air.  A whole wall of brilliant fire, moaning and now moving towards my midst.</p>
<p>But I did not budge: into the high guard I raised the black blade.</p>
<p>Trust was in me.</p>
<p>Trust for the coming truth: that magick can be a thing <i>unmade.</i></p>
<p>Then, with a breath, I brandished down the dour sword.</p>
<p>A dull bellow beat my ears as the blade plunged with a weighty wind.  Wolfsteel sliced through walls of flame, and in the blink of an eye, the brimming fires all fled like a fog before a sudden sun.</p>
<p>“&#8230;W-w…”</p>
<p>Ebbe’s men bent their brows in disbelief, whilst missing from one of their necks was a head, now wheeling high in the air: I had not tarried to watch the wall vanish as they did, but instead sprinted through the spectacle and into their ranks, brandishing again the unbrightened blade.</p>
<p>Blood fountained from the neck-stump as the rest of the fresh corpse crumbled to its knees.  The silverstaff once fast in its hands rolled free along the ground.</p>
<p>“No…  Ye be weak!  Weak!  <i>We—ak!!”</i> cried the closest brute as he raised high his silverblade.</p>
<p>That scorn of his, still steadfast in spite of his imperilled plight, was rather moving, in a way.  And so did I move back by half a step.</p>
<p><i>“Ach…</i>  Ye rat!”  With a curse, the man stumbled, missing his moment to strike.  Left undecided for an instant, he was met by my immediate advance.</p>
<p><i>“Aurrh!”</i></p>
<p>The guttural groan of my mark, and his last breath besides, for shooting straight through his throat now was the broad blade-head of the <i>svǫrtaskan.</i>  Extracting it from the expiring flesh, I watched my foe founder to the dust as both blood and breath sputtered out of his gaping wound.</p>
<p>I ducked—air whistled above.</p>
<p><i>“Owach!?”</i></p>
<p>A yelp from behind.  A blade, missing its mark.  An assailant, surprised.  Though the surprise was solely his: just their sounds, the very darting of their eyes, plainly gave away all of these men’s movements.</p>
<p>There was at least some wherewithal in him, my ambusher, for his sword arm remembered to reel his blade back in for the follow-up.  Only, fastness found him not, for in the midst of his motion, my sword was already soaring.  Bracing my belly-sinews, I next sent the black sword plunging down.</p>
<p>—<i>Gwshhokh.</i></p>
<p>A grumbling, grinding groan: the air jarred as jet steel cleaved through the brute’s bosom.  Silver plates creased like crumpling paper.  Bones shattered into shards.  The beating heart therein was halved.</p>
<p>My foe faltered to the ground, blood bursting from his mouth and torso both.</p>
<p>“A… a lie!  A lie ‘pon the eyes!  A <i>li—e!!”</i>  From beyond the blood spray, a shrill denial from yet another challenger.  He sprinted in, sword in single-handed tow.</p>
<p>An often sight in this realm: men wielding with one hand what is meant for two.  Certainly a sword so swung can cut a foe—given enough odyl.  But such half-hearted, half-handed hewing becomes only the thespian swashbuckler.  Pageantry wins the stage; practice wins the battlefield.</p>
<p>Thus a soldier set in swinging with one hand ill-strikes as true as another with two.  Correct form is quick-forgotten by him.  Accuracy is but an afterthought.  He is bent on naught but the beauty of battle, and so marches all the more hastily to his unmarked grave.</p>
<p>Such a soldier breathed before me now.  His was a sword seeming more a twig in a toddler’s hands.</p>
<p>And from that sword of his, there bloomed a bang of sparks: with but a swing of my own was the it repelled to no peril, for in the silverslash’s infantile arch was imbued neither subtlety nor strength—nor odyl for that matter, as all magicked strength therein sublimated instantly before the soot-steel.</p>
<p><i>“Eyh?”</i></p>
<p>From his lips, the low yip of despair.  From his eyes, the reflection of my quickly encroaching form, blade borne in the low guard.</p>
<p>Strength flashed through my two arms.</p>
<p>With a whole-sinewed, whole-souled swing, up soared the soot-steeped sword.</p>
<p>And from my mark: a scream.  <i>“Eaahhrrg—!!”</i></p>
<p><i>—Ggsshhaakh!</i></p>
<p>The sable half-circle sliced into the grunt’s groin before bursting out of his brain-cage.</p>
<p>Armour, flesh, bone—all were sundered.  The man: now but left and right halves of a hewn cadaver, falling to feed the worms.  The sight of it elicited a collective gasp from my remnant foes.</p>
<p>Foes, who now numbered but two.</p>
<p>Foes, who next found my gaze fixed upon them.</p>
<p>Foes, who but stood with faces of fey pallour.</p>
<p>Their shoulders shuddered as my words met their ears.</p>
<p>“Ebbe.  Karl.  We settle this—now.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>“What myst… be this…?”</p>
<p>Lise could but look on in awe. In her gaze of green was reflected the figure of Rolf, rending his foes, his <em>kinsmen,</em> upon the plaza below.</p>
<p>Oh, ‘what myst’, indeed.</p>
<p>The very first to confound her was wrapped in Rolf’s very fingers: Gweil&#8217;ǫrr’s ire, the <em>svǫrtaskan,</em> slashing to and fro, scything silver and finding flesh.</p>
<p>But what of explanation? Of <em>reason?</em> For the black blade had hitherto scorned all skin, had it not? A phenomenon of fangs, biting and burning the taming touch, gloved or no! Such was this sword, sheathed in stone-like solitude, knowing no warmth within all the many winters of its witnessing.</p>
<p>The chroniclers called it a material memory of the Tívafornár, the everdistant days when gods of eld yet graced the land. But of wielders, of <em>masters</em> to this sword, those same chroniclers knew not, for neither scrolls of their scouring nor songs yet sung remember now any such soul so steeped in soot.</p>
<p>Would that they were here with Lise, to witness the brightless blade wielded anew in the hands of one Rolf Buckmann!</p>
<p>The second myst to surprise the wide-eyed Lise? Why, the very metal of the sword itself. Wrought in wolfsteel, the weapon was of a weight thought beyond all wielding. And so was it long relegated to rituals, earning honour as a sword of ceremony, far from any battle where it might sooner boast of breaking its master’s bones than drinking the blood of its marks. The Hensenfolk found much reason in this, and thus had forgotten all need to bring its sharpness to bear.</p>
<p>But such weight was as wind to Rolf. The sword swept and sliced as though it were a dagger dancing in his hands, its every stroke striking with utmost surety. Yet Rolf himself seemed in no condition to conjure such martial miracles—he was unmended! Weathered with wounds every which way! Pulsing pain should be his principal opponent, but to pay it no mind and <em>make battle</em> instead? No doubt a mountainous effort certain to unmake him at any moment.</p>
<p>Yet, it was an effort endeavoured enduringly. Weighty wolfsteel flew through flesh, free as a feather. What skill. What <em>steeled resolve.</em> Lise realised it then: Rolf was of another plane.</p>
<p>And that itself was the third myst: in all the years of Lise’s life, never had she seen more strongly, more swiftly, more stately a sword swung than Rolf’s sooted own. A fleet flow of manoeuvres, from mind to motion: with gallantry in his gait did Rolf rush in and hew his fangless foes. One by one, they were handed their defeat, gifts from a galloping blade spurred on by unspoiled technique.</p>
<p>As Lise watched, fixed and fascinated by the affrighted fray, the fourth myst was made manifest: the unmaking of both Men and their argent armour. With but a swing, Rolf rent them both asunder to no resistance—and to no impossibility, either. No, a prank of the pixies this was not: Lise’s former foe’s was a physique most fit for the phenomenon. Add to that his fey and fatal finesse, and his unbending blade of ashened wolfsteel besides, then certainly such a spectacle of monstrous might was no mere mirage.</p>
<p>But the next and final myst was what truly baffled her.</p>
<p>Rolf had maimed a <span class="emphasized">magick</span> unto <span class="emphasized">nothingness.</span></p>
<p>“Cutting through spells”—a phrase that fights reason. But such contest was of no constriction to Rolf. With a swing of the sunless sword was ensorcelled fire snuffed like a candle. Inconceivable, but incontrovertible.</p>
<p>Of what buttressed that truth, Lise knew less than little. Though suppose such unprecedented power possessed the blade. What of knowledge of its nature? What of inspiration, of <em>gall</em> to wield it to this very purpose? Not least within the first moments shared between sword and swordsman?</p>
<p>What had driven Rolf to trust the blade’s mettle against the might of magicks?</p>
<p>The answer laid somewhere in those throes of soot and silver, but try as she might, Lise could not espy it, even as Rolf’s fighting form earned her enduring and emerald gaze. Myst after myst, miracle after miracle, Lise was a but a bewildered witness to it all.</p>
<p>Still, one thing was most certain: the blood spilt, the bodies sinking into seas of red, all belonged to Rolf’s Londosian brothers. Yet more certain again was that his bloody betrayal birthed not a wisp of fear nor hateful frost in Lise’s heart.</p>
<p>No. Rolf was resplendent.</p>
<p>A wolf of noble worth.</p>
<p>That was her unmired measure of him. For why, she had not the words, only that her heart of hearts was firm in feeling so.</p>
<p>And one last wonder lingered in her awe: the streams of soot trailing each swing of the sword. The legends, indeed, had spoken true, for as Rolf rived flesh and silver, soot verily sang about his person.</p>
<p>In Lise’s eyes, the blackness was a thing of beauty. Like silken smoke or lightless ink lilting across canvasses of air, the raven ribbons swirled, swartening even the night, only to then fade to naught. Unforgotten, Gweil&#8217;ǫrr’s memory seemed more and more a blade mantled in both the grandness of a beast and the grace of a butterfly.</p>
<p>And amidst its mighty swings of soot and blood was Rolf, bathed in the blackness. But seen in the swarthy seams were his eyes, glinting with the twin vesper-stars of valour and volition.</p>
<p>Could this world bear aught more beautiful?</p>
<p>The question took hold of Lise. Nevermind the blood-mired battlefield upon which it was painted. This was a masterpiece to the Nafíl maiden, one beyond all words. She was enchanted, enraptured, by what might pass for a <em>hilditýr’s</em> deadly dance; little did she know, upon her cheeks had long bloomed a rosy blush, whilst her breaths rolled broken and bated.</p>

</div>

<p>And when the throes thinned to silence at last, Lise was lifted back to the moment at hand, finding Rolf facing his last two foes.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>∵</strong></p>

<p>“W-w… witch’ry…! <em>A trick…!”</em> stammered Karl, staring at me as I stood encircled by corpses. “Yer weak! <em>Ungraced!</em> Gouge me eyes, they sees a lie!” The varlet’s voice undulated with umbrage, yet his face was faint with pallour. That anger undergirded his words regardless showed that the boy was but barking away, perhaps to forget the fear so clear on his countenance.</p>
<p>“C-C… Commandant. How handy you be with a sword. Why, I-I never knew! H-heheh…” Ebbe broke his silence. Calm seemed hale in him—more so than Karl, at least. “An ungraced, piercing the paling? Fancy that. T-tell me, Commandant. You look t’have cut through us cuirasses, sunder’d us spells. You—an odylless bloke. What’s the trick, ey?”</p>
<p>This cullion, too, was quivering in his enquiry. Minced talk seemed his tactic—a valid one, I’ll give him that. A bit of parleying to parlay his dusking plight, to be sure.</p>
<p>“Trick?” I shook my head. “You saw no trick, Ebbe. But if <em>truth</em> be your craving, then come. Seek it from this sword. It can sing the answer sooner than I,” I said at length, standing newly ready. “Though, a warning: I know your worth. Of how your idle days have dulled your swords to sticks. Mine, I’ve honed under many suns and moons, more so than you ever have—and ever will.”</p>
<p><em>“Sh-sh-shhhkh—!!”</em> Karl frothed. “Shut it, ye shite-breed, <em>yeee—u!!”</em></p>
<p>“Sticks” seemed to have stung a nerve in this nithing as he flew fast upon me in fury. But from its flailing, his sword truly was no more a stick, fit only for a brat’s make-believe battle. One I humoured: his nearing metal was matched with a sweep of my own.</p>
<p>Silver brushed upon black steel. The air hissed. Karl’s sword swerved off to nowhere, whilst I next moved mine to the low guard and heaved it up in a geyser of a slash.</p>
<p><em>“Woaah!?”</em> the sword-brat yelped, falling to his bottom in miserable retreat. Yet victory was still so craved that amidst his fall, he flung his sword at me. Only, the bladed flight was broken with a simple flick of the soot-steel.</p>
<p>“You cling close to life, Karl,” I remarked. “Admirable—if not ungraceful.”</p>
<p>Veins writhed. <em>“Ungrrr—!?</em> Shut it! Shut! Shut-shut-<em>shut!!”</em></p>
<p>Amidst his cries, Karl clamoured about before filching a sword from the fingers of one of his fallen fellows. Back on his feet, he funnelled odyl into the silver length, screaming out a bladespell’s name.</p>
<p><strong>“Annihilandō!!”</strong></p>
<p><em>—Gwofhh!</em></p>
<p>Like a deep, windy drumbeat, the scene snarled as flames newly furled about Karl’s sword, illumed by which was his face, so utterly steeped in fury.</p>
<p>“K-Karl! Calm, my boy!” cried Ebbe. “You, me, the commandant—cut from the same Londosian cloth! That’s us! Come, we ought settle this with words than war! R-right!? Commandant!”</p>
<p>The hellion shook his head heatedly. “Spare th’peace-spit, Master Ebbe! Why, I’d stick pins in me eyes than parley with this pansy!”</p>
<p>“Likewise, Karl,” I echoed. “Funny—to only now find more in common with you than the reckoning to come!”</p>
<p><em>“Aaaegh!!”</em> blared the bomb-like boy. “Whoreson!! Sin-breed!! Bastard!!” Karl’s boiling veins bubbled further. His eyes bulged, his gaze was as brimstone. <em>“You</em> be th’wayward one ‘ere! Evil incarnate! Wayside waif! Yoná toss’d ye fer th’turncoat ye be! So back t’the bottom with ye, I says! Back t’the bottom! Where ye <em>belo—ng!!”</em></p>
<p>At once, Karl came blasting in. The searing sword in his hands swept ahead. Hellfire followed, filling the air with gusting heat.</p>
<p>I stamped forth head-on, firing off the blackbrand in an arch counter to Karl’s own.</p>

<p>Silver and steel.</p>
<p>Half-circles, sailing, <em>crashing.</em></p>
<p>The night thundered. The air thrashed.</p>
<p>Hellfires faded to a hush.</p>
<p>Silence hung.</p>

<p><em>“Ah… a-aah…”</em> my foe gasped at length.</p>
<p>“Karl,” I said to him. “Recall the rally against the retreating Nafílim. A rally you all executed against my command, when I was yet green upon my post.” Into his dazed eyes I stared as we stood vis-à-vis. “Remember you a certain axe-brave? Big? Yet deathblown by your bloodlust?”</p>
<p>His gaze twitched. “W… w-wot ye on ‘bout, eh? ‘Axe-brave’? Me pate ‘asn’t room fer rememb’rin’ rubbish!”</p>
<p>Mia’s father was fast forgotten to him, it seemed. How I wished he had at least the wherewithal to keep some memory of his murdered marks.</p>
<p>“A shame,” I said. “I’ll remember you, Karl.”</p>
<p>Blackness gnashed once more.</p>
<p>The brightless blade shadow-flashed—</p>
<p>—and flew through Karl’s throat.</p>
<p><em>“Hkkh?”</em></p>
<p>His silver sword clamoured to the dust.</p>
<p><em>“…kh… gwhhrr…”</em></p>
<p>Reaching up, Karl grabbed the gushing gash in his gullet. But try as he might, the redness only ran on through his fingers. Death was knocking. Perhaps pained by the unsought sound, he mustered malice and misery into his face, twisting it every which way. All the while, he stared at me, crazed.</p>
<p><em>“Hhhhaa…! ghr… rhh…”</em></p>
<p>Before long, the vessels and veins to his brain were void of vitality. Eyes, once wild with hate, waned as his thoughts thinned to naught. Hands, once desperate for deliverance, dropped and dangled limp. His knees gave, letting his bloodletted body collapse to the dust.</p>
<p>Just Ebbe and I now remained.</p>
<p>We stood there face-to-face, with only Karl’s crumpled corpse between us. His sallowed face full-soaked in frosty sweat, Ebbe quaked in his boots, his teeth rattling all the while.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Ha… haha… C-Commandant. Dear Commandant. Why, yo-you be more a lion than I like you t’be.”</p>
<p>I slowly approached.</p>
<p>“W-what skill! What deadly deftness! Overcome odyllessness an’ this be what’s begotten! Hah…! Who knew? T-tell me, dread Commandant. What be th’source o’ all that strength, ey?”</p>
<p>Closer still.</p>
<p>“Oh, yea. Strength, strong indeed, might’ly mete for Londosius! Er, mighty ‘nough for uh… for, for the Order, why not! Yea, bravely back t’the Order with you! With full honours! Hurrah! Heheh…!”</p>
<p>I stopped.</p>
<p>Ebbe was spending all powers of speech to delay his doom. It seemed he well-knew his swordsmanship would prove poor prevention. Still, even such powers had gone sour, for the content of his ramblings were all but rubbish to my ears—and my heart.</p>
<p>“Truly, Ebbe?” I spoke at last. “Is Londosian love so cheap? To have new charity for the child it has hotly hated? You saw what I’ve done: I sent steel sundering through <em>Londosian</em> sons.”</p>
<p>“D-dirty details, I say!” he cried, waving his hand. “Nothing t’sweat ‘bout, yea? L-like I said, words ‘fore war, heh! So why not wind it down, ey? Talk this over with a cheery chat. Come now, Commandant!”</p>
<p>Talk.</p>
<p>What talk?</p>
<p>By now, the will to wend back to Londosius was all but long gone in me.</p>
<p>“Ebbe. The reckoning’s reached. Ready your sword.”</p>
<p>The bony man’s mien fell to a frown.</p>
<p>Deeper now was the nightly silence, for all the hoofbeats, war-bellows, and sword-biting that once battered the air had ceased before our noticing. The march of Men, then, was unmade. The Fiefguard had failed. Faint now, too, was the fray at the west gate.</p>
<p>The curtains were closing at last.</p>
<p>The battle for Hensen: dying down to its last embers.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>“&#8230;I… I surrender,” Ebbe groaned, grinding his teeth as though his words were wrung wrenchingly out of his very heart.  The former pallour on his face was flaring red—a fire likely lit by shame, full and sore.  But to forgive him was a mercy gone before its begetting.</p>
<p>“I spit on your surrender.”</p>
<p>My curt words seemed a sword-cut upon his soul, for Ebbe’s eyes then widened with bewilderment and woe.  And from their corners: the coursing of tears.</p>
<p>“W-wh-what’s this now?  C-Commandant!  You’ve clench’d this battle, you have!  The day be yours!  What worth’s there in waging more war, ey!?”</p>
<p>There: a hard-reached truth trickling from his whimpering.</p>
<p>Volker’s was an advantaged position.  He and his spears had been holding the line near the west gate before my return to this district, an effort soon availed by fresh reinforcements.  The din of battle was now all but dimmed to our ears, Ebbe’s and mine, and the spread of the fires had ceased a long while ago.</p>
<p>It was certain: the Fiefguard were routed, if not already well on the way to ruin.  Ebbe’s unit, too, the treasured chariot of their charge, laid as lifeless litter upon these streets.</p>
<p>Their foray failed.  Hensen was saved.</p>
<p>Ebbe also seemed wise to this, if his grovelling served any sign.</p>
<p>“C-Come now, Commandant!  Be a brother, ey?  You’d not bag a surren’dring soldier, now would you?  You’re a soul too upstanding for that!”</p>
<p>Words of waste.  Ebbe was brokering his own capture to <i>me:</i> a man at once a withersake, and a flyer of no flag at another.  Unbeholden as I was, mine was hardly a position to give quarter.  But I let it be.</p>
<p>Only after tempering my will to much pain did I set first foot upon this new path.  Such will was not wont to turn heel so flippantly.</p>
<p>“Ebbe.  A soul takes up sword not to hew those with neither heart nor hunger for battle.”</p>
<p>Ebbe broke a solaced smile.  “W-well, then!  Let’s—”</p>
<p>“But a sword that hews those that’ve meted malice unto the meek—<i>that</i> is <i>my</i> sword.”</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;Hhuh…?”</i>  His smile lingered a little, though now thoroughly sapped of its former security.  An expression gilt in guilt, for Ebbe was a man long and well-bent on burgling and butchering the Nafílim smallfolk.</p>
<p>It was that very bent of his that had brought him here to Hensen.  A bent that has branded him, beyond all doubt, a <i>slayer of innocents.</i></p>
<p>And so must he be slain by this slayer of slayers.</p>
<p>“Keep this course of carnage, and carnage shall be your own soon enough,” I assured him.  “I’ll stand ready to wreak it upon you <i>all.”</i></p>
<p>“N… n-no…!” Ebbe trembled.  “M-ma-madness…!  <i>Madness!”</i></p>
<p>Death was coming.  Without question, it was coming.  And Ebbe was at last sore-enlightened to its looming.</p>
<p>“Know this, Ebbe,” I spoke with finality.  “Run, and I’ll run this sword through your spine.  Fall to your knees, and I’ll fell your head from its neck.”</p>
<p>Were it in him to shame me any further, then certainly either choice would’ve done the deed.  I’ll admit, even, to having desired from Ebbe some belligerent resistance, even if dire, for I did not fain finishing off a man so dispossessed of all spirit for battle.</p>
<p><i>“H… haa… haaahh…”</i></p>
<p>So breathed his beleaguered bosom.  Aimless, his eyes searched the skies as his face swam in its own sweat and tears.</p>
<p><i>“Hhif… hic… ufh…”</i></p>
<p>Snivels and snarls began stammering out of his lungs, which quivered along with his weeping.  His eyeballs darted about, busied with despair.  Such anxiety next spilt upon the rest of his face: curling upon his lips now was a ghost of a smirk.</p>
<p><i>“A-aah, aaaah…”</i></p>
<p>Karl once said it himself.</p>
<p>That on the looking glass of Londosius, my deeds cast a revolting reflection.</p>
<p>Of evil, of strangeness.</p>
<p>So utterly contrary to the noble cause of the kingdom.</p>
<p>To the Men of the realm, the Nafílim are a people to be plundered, dregs to be death-driven, black lambs to be lampooned.  The jeering, the genocide—all but a “justice” meted unto them.</p>
<p>Such thoughts find no home in my heart.  And so did my feet find a different path.  For my eyes see in a Nafíl a gaze that witnesses the world no less wondrously than mine, feet that tread the way no less wistfully and waveringly than mine, a heart that seeks solace and society no less longingly than mine.</p>
<p>To any other Man, such eyes must be shuttered, such feet must be shackled, such hearts must be shattered.  For these features, though shared, are of a baser breed, beasts unto which extinction must be exacted.</p>
<p>But I am the son long spurned from that line of Men and mind.</p>
<p>Thus should our paths find no parallel, should neither their centuries-sallowed ideals nor my will of wearied winters yield to the other therefore, then betwixt myself and my former brethren lies naught but battle.</p>
<p>Naught, but a game of victims and vanquishers.</p>
<p>A game, a gamble, a battle I brace the whole of my girth for.</p>
<p>But by my measure, Ebbe was burdened by no such resolve.  Small wonder as to why he was now so whelmed out of his wits by this swift situation.  Battle, to him, was ever a birthday celebration: an occasion to consume, devour, and feast upon fruits hard-harvested by not one finger of his own.</p>
<p><i>“Aa-a-aa!  Aaaaaahh—!!”</i></p>
<p>So screamed that same man, scrambling towards me with sword raised dubiously high—the shamble of a crying corpse.</p>

<p><i>Thump.</i></p>
<p>So drummed the dry air.</p>

<p>I had pelted past him, sending the <i>svǫrtaskan</i> slanting through his silvered bosom along the way.  Blood next danced deliriously from the dire seam, dousing his brotherly dead.</p>
<p><i>“Ah,</i> I, I… I-I…  <i>I…!”</i></p>
<p>Broken words, cackling from Ebbe’s coldening core, as he tottered and tumbled to the ground.  There he laid, till all life left him.</p>
<p><i>‘I.’</i></p>
<p>What was it he meant to say, I wonder?</p>
<p>I could’ve lent ear to him, for just this once.  A final pittance he perhaps half-deserved, at least.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>

<p>“Rolf…” said Lise, “&#8230;much thanks.  For fighting for my folk.”</p>
<p>It was after Ebbe’s end that the jarl’s daughter had descended to the plaza.  And what words did she first have for me, a Manslayer of a Man, but words of gratitude.</p>
<p>Indeed, she asked not if I had decided upon this deed with undimmed mind, nor craved account for my mounting the chariot of treason.</p>
<p>Brotherly blood was on my hands, and yet she thanked me for it.</p>
<p>How glad it made me.</p>
<p>“Pay it no mind,” I said.  “Have you taken wound?”</p>
<p>“Nay—close, but I’ve to care for little more than scratches, thanks to you,” she answered.  “But mind not me; what mightiness you’ve shown, Rolf!  Rending through the realmers like you did—all by yourself!”</p>
<p>High praise, supported by the pall of honesty in her eyes.  While grateful, I found such lauding hard to swallow.</p>
<p>“A might too meagre, I’m afraid,” I shook my head.  “Look—the sword’s steeped me in soot.”</p>
<p>“Mm?” Lise blinked, leaning in inquisitively.  “Steeped, indeed.  The old tales told true, then.  But why ‘meagre’?”</p>
<p>Swing the <i>svǫrtaskan,</i> and soot follows—one of few remembrances from myths of eld.  And accurate they were, for in the course of slaying the silvered Men was much soot sent to swarten the air… and my person besides.</p>
<p>“Were my skill any keener, I might’ve swung this sword with nary a blot to blacken my body,” I explained.  “My soot-steeped self proves I’m yet greener than a grove.”</p>
<p>“A… a curious thing you say, Rolf.  But your word I’ll take.  Though if it worries you much, might raiments of black suit you better from here on?”</p>
<p>I gave a blink of my own.  “‘From here on’?  You’ll allow me this sword?  Frankly I feel a fated affinity with it, and so am loath to leave it, but…” I then paused to gaze upon the gloam-blade, “&#8230;it is a true relic.  By rights, such treasure must remain in this land, with its people, no?”</p>
<p>It should, indeed, revered relic that it was.</p>
<p>Forged in the far days of the Tívafornár, tempered tenebrous by the flames of an eldened dragon: the sword of soot.  No doubt it bore much meaning to the Nafílim folk—too much for some silly Man to brandish.</p>
<p>“‘A sword wastes unswung’.  That, I’m sure everyone will say.  My father, as well,” Lise assured me.  “Besides, it has scorched and scorned all hands save yours, Rolf.  Who better to wield it than the one it welcomes?”</p>
<p>“You’re very kind, Lise.  My thanks.  I’ll speak on this matter with the jarl, next we meet.”</p>
<p>From the way of her words, Lise seemed undoubtful that henceforth would I wage war under the Nafílim flag.  Her own father, the Jarl Alban, and his húskarlar besides… though their hearts were yet harbours for abhorrence against the grim deeds of my kin, never did I descry in them the same senseless hate that hollowed the bosoms of Men.  Indeed, in their hardened hearts may yet be found more softness for this wayward soul than formerly thought.</p>
<p>Why, Berta herself looked the living symbol for such accord.  Her warmth of recognition was cause for much security and kinship.</p>
<p>A warmth, now cooled to all coldness.</p>
<p>I turned up to the paths above, where sat the stilled figure of Berta.  What myriad mirth once brimmed from that woman.  A mirth to be dearly missed.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Berta’s braves…” Lise spoke, having followed my eyes, “&#8230;from their war-chief they broke away, that they might hunt down the Men who straggled in the shadows.  ‘Twas there where they joined with my own detachment.  I left the duty to all of them… and broke away myself.  Berta’s plight was a worry to me, you see.  But… though I be swift on steed, ‘swift’ was overslow…”</p>
<p>‘Slow’, in saving Berta.</p>
<p>How harrowing it must’ve been.</p>
<p>Lise had till but a moment before a sprightliness to her spirit.  Yet it was the truth that sorrow ached under her actions, and seeing Berta’s breathless body once more, the girl could no longer contain it.</p>
<p>“Best we leave our lament for later,” I said softly to her.  “We must meet with Volker.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;That we should.”</p>
<p>Grief, grievance—these are to be saved after silence settles on the battlefield, for fighters tarry on peril of aught and all they strive to protect.  Wishing to see the score of our wagers, Lise and I then left for the fray at the west gates.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>

<p>Nearing the war-torn west end, we sensed in the air a change.  Not long after, we found the frontlines hard-fought and—matching my earlier measure—hard-won.  Volker’s regiment had wrested the reins of the battle from the Fiefguard, whose Men now retreated in their rout.</p>
<p>Forming a deep column looked to have bore fruit: with the war-chief at its fore, the Nafílim phalanx fought and felled the Men’s forces one by one, reaping steadily away at their ranks, till the coming of reinforcements much yearned-for.  Then did the tides roar in Hensen’s favour as its braves rallied and rained down upon the Fiefguard with a swift offensive.</p>
<p><i>“Eaaa—hhgh!!”</i></p>
<p>So screamed the failure and fall of Men.  Laying torches had yielded them little avail; indeed, the flaming ruins of their own wreaking barred every avenue of escape.  The folly left them flanked, and summarily vanquished by Volker’s spears, the Men’s numbers were soon broken beyond all powers of organised reprisal.</p>
<p>Some succeeded in fleeing the fólkheimr, but the brothers they left behind were legion.  Soon enough, Hensen was hollowed of its harriers, and sensing their utter silence, Volker reared his steed and raised his voice.</p>
<p>“Unmade is the enemy!  Vict’ry for Hensen!  Vict’ry!!”</p>
<p>Following the thunder of his words was a storm of cheer.  The day was won.  Hensen would know another dawn.</p>
<p>Yet Volker’s visage wore a sombre dusk.  Just moments ago were tidings of Berta’s undoing delivered to his ears by Lise herself.  It looked to weigh darkly on his heart, as did the many deaths of smallfolk too-slow in their flight from the Fiefguard.</p>
<p>But through eyes of a different calculation, “many” was a small sacrifice for what was easily a miracle, one that saw Hensen smite a sudden foe flooding into its sleeping streets, of numbers never before fought within its walls.</p>
<p>Nay…</p>
<p>To sweep away the matter with so coldly comforting a term as “small sacrifice” beckoned a weighty darkness upon my own heart…</p>
<p>“We won… We <i>won…”</i> Lise muttered amidst the victory cries, “&#8230;and we’re safe, just like you said, Auntie…”</p>
<p>Up to the high night was she turned, whispering the good news to Berta.  Good, indeed, for each and all in the late war-chief’s charge were safe and sound.</p>
<p>“Rolf,” called Volker, descending from his steed.  “Much debt to you.”</p>
<p>Gratitude, as concise as was his countenance empty of expression.  Not that I had cause for complaint.  His was a reticence I shared, and enlightened to it, I then saw in him something of a kindred spirit.</p>
<p>And as for the “why” of his words, I ventured a guess: my counsel for the abandonment of material goods as bait, as well as turning the Fiefguard’s flames to their disadvantage.</p>
<p>“Truth be told, I half-trusted your trick,” the war-chief confessed.  “Though I was the one trick’d, for I trusted too little that Men be ill-wean’d from the milk of mammon—even amidst a battle.”</p>
<p>The Fiefguard’s movements well-seemed a puzzle to him.</p>
<p>“They’re a lusty lot, see,” I explained.  “The village raid of five months ago—the ill-gotten gains there engorged their coffers… and their cravings more so.  Beasts yearning for yet another bite of their bait: that’s what they’ve made of themselves.  One needs little more than shallow wit to leash them in.”</p>
<p>“Words of much weight…” Volker quietly remarked.</p>
<p>“But of small avail,” I continued with graveness, “were it the Order’s vassals that endeavoured this invasion.  If you reckon contest with the knights, you’ll need plenty more than petty tactics.”</p>
<p>An unwelcome conjecture upon the ears of both Volker and Lise, for they now turned to me with faces of solemnity.  And for what reason than my hint of hostilities with the Order.</p>
<p>“Rolf,” said Volker firmly.  “A different weight those words bear…”</p>
<p>“I’ve a plan—one for the jarl’s ears.  Admit me to him at the earliest, if you will.”</p>
<p>“A <i>plan?”</i> Volker echoed with brows bent.  Why talk of plans when the battle was freshly ended, and with but a breath of air as sole succour for the braves?  This seemed the question cut into his stone-like stare.</p>
<p>“You heard right.  Reach for Balasthea now, and you’ll reap much,” I confirmed, earning silence from Lise, Volker, and all the Nafílim nearby.  “My predecessor has taken ill.  The fort’s acting commandant, then, stands not within its walls, but before your very eyes.  And on his hands is blood, hewn from the second-in-charge himself.”</p>
<p>That same silence soared into surprise.  But their collective interest was well-piqued as they kept both quiet and their ears pricked.</p>
<p>“The fort looms fallow, cut from all command,” I went on.  “The iron glows hot; strike now and bend it to your will, before any rigour be given to its restoration.  And I—” so began my resolve as I rested a hand upon the soot-steel, “—I will march with you.”</p>
<p>Solace and security were ever fleeting to the Nafílim, so long as Balasthea stood yet unbroken and Arbel’s remnant Fiefguardsmen yet unfelled.  But take the fort, and these braves shall gain a vital beachhead for an offensive upon Ström’s beating heart.  Only then shall Hensen’s own know a measure of peace.</p>
<p>And from there…</p>
<p>“Rolf…” said Volker, drawing near, “&#8230;you are resolute?”</p>
<p>I looked to him.  “I am.”</p>
<p>Was I truly willing to march with the Nafílim?  Had I the heart to stand against my own kin?  The war-chief’s was a question asking much with very little, to descry my true determination in this unprecedented plight.</p>
<p>And so I laid his doubts to rest.</p>
