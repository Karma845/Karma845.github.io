<h2 style="text-align:center;">Ⅵ</h2>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas a week since the screening for the post of chief adjutant, with not a day spent without great thought upon Rolf… namely, his hand’s refusal of my availing own.  Anger, sorrow—they were as tyrants over my heart, with one handing its rule to the other at each turn of the day.  ‘Twas when such a week was beginning to leave me frayed and weary that I received a particular missive.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The seal of House Mernesse was pressed upon it.  And signed within: the name of a certain servant.  And signed within: the name of a certain servant.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">”Maria”.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Writ was her desire to meet me and confide a matter of some import.  Of course, I obliged.  Maria was a handmaiden most dear to me, after all, a soul of no replacement.  Though my time as a mareschal was precious, Maria was more so, thus I wrote back that she would be gladly received.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And indeed she was; some days afterwards, Maria arrived at the 5th’s gates.  But to my astonishment, she was wholly unaccompanied not only when she had walked into my chamber, but through the entirety of her trip.  The way stretched much between the Mernesse residence and this marquisate of Norden; that the little girl once so timid had grown quickly into a bold, young woman came as a sincere shock to me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Still, no damsel should endeavour so long a journey alone,” I told her.  “I’ll send for escorts when you mean to return.  They’ll keep you safe on the road.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“M’lady, pray spare the trouble,” she tried to soothe my worries.  “I went the way without incident; there is security enough in a stagecoach.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nay, Maria.  One so dear to me deserves the utmost,” I said, then sighing.  “Would that Father is as precious with you as I…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There in the mareschal’s chamber did we then sit ourselves on settees and share recent happenings over tea.  From her words, Mother and Father were both hale as ever.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Things good and glad to my ears, but hardly the aim of Maria’s days-long trip.  As our chat went on, her face ever so slightly furrowed more and more, as though the purpose of our meeting were a thorn deeply pricking the tip of her tongue.  So much so that I, too, began to feel its sting, and so wishing to bridge the impasse, I enquired her of it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Hesitation gripped Maria for a moment, but with eyes newly steadfast, she began to speak.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I’ve heard tell of Lord Rolf, m’lady.  To wit, his expulsion from the Order.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My brows fell.  “Then you’ve heard aright.  He was exiled… on account of cutting a horse loose beyond his ken.  ‘Twas a gift from His Majesty, to be sure, but… the incident caused more a tumult than it should.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A topic bitter upon my own tongue.  But for Maria’s sake, I minded it little.  And so I related to her in full the scandal leading to Rolf’s discharge.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Exile be a price too heavy for a sin so light.  All we’d lost was a horse, after all, even if ‘twas the king’s own once,” I continued at length.  “No… ‘twas Rolf’s refusal to apologise that tipped the scales against him.  Remorse, reflection… he was fain for neither.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Welling up next in my heart were memories of Rolf’s tight-lipped defiance.  And muddying them: his sore absence from the screening just a week past.  A chance given and turned away…  Reminded, I felt then the all-too familiar teeth of anger and sorrow gnawing away at me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sighing again, I sipped a bit of tea.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“He who sooner cowers than confronts his faults ill-bears the burden of knighthood,” I went on.  “Such a soul finds pale purpose in the Order…  And so I had him leave our halls.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ending my account of the matter, I then found on Maria a downcast look, sombre and miserable.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I’m sorry, Maria,” I tried to console her.  “To see so long-fond a friend as Rolf lose his way…  It grieves me no less than it does you.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf was a familiar face to Maria for many years.  Small wonder, then, that she would ache for the wunderkind she once knew.  One sent far away, after having realised so little of his childhood ambition.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yet knighthood chooses the knight, in the end,” I filled the silence.  “Only those who suit the surcoat can rightly fly the knightly flag.  ‘Twas Rolf’s dearest dream, truly… though I’m afraid some dreams are only for bedtime.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I laid down my teacup.  The tiny porcelain <i>clink</i> against the saucer was as a clap against the air, stifled and heavy in its emptiness.  Such quietude rasped against our ears.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Maria…  I have hope for him yet,” I began again.  “Given chance, he might change his ways.  A chance I’ve well-given him, only—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nay, m’lady…”  An interruption, soft yet resolved.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I blinked.  “M-Maria?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That’s not it at all,” she insisted.  “When the horse had gone missing, Lord Rolf was long-away from these halls.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;W… what…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Maria’s words were as lightning, striking away my every effort to comprehend them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“M’lady…  ‘Twas not he who had set it loose.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Maria’s ensuing relation to me was not of explanation for Rolf, but herself.  ‘Twas harrowing to discover that she numbered amongst the many victims of the Albecks’ loathsome sins.  There was some measure of gladness, however, in knowing that she was spared of the worst, but that she told her story with much torment was evident that, to this moment, it all yet haunted her terribly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oh, Maria…  What turmoil you’ve known…  I’m sorry.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You are ever kind, m’lady.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Always had I known Maria to be rather reserved, even back when she was of years better spent in play than chores.  During those days, I could on occasion glean some shade eclipsing her otherwise sunny visage.  The pieces fell into place, then, knowing now that such a past was casting that darkness upon her all along.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">By her words, ‘twas one coincidence after another that led to her safe flight from the Albecks’ grip eight years ago.  The doom suffered by their other victims was cause for much grief, of course, but knowing that, at the very least, my dear Maria was alive to tell the tale earned my enduring gratitude for those miracles.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And yet what bravery you’ve displayed, to have come to the 5th with not a friend in tow.  Despite the shadows of your past…” I remarked, before shaking my head.  “Nay.  Absent such shadows, the long way is worrisome enough, not least for a lady unled.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I owe much to Lord Rolf for my resolve,” she said with some light to her words.  “Without him, I would yet be a mouse, quivering in a dark corner.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Maria…” I said fadingly.  The questions yet loomed.  “I fear I don’t follow.  Your past was a grave plight, indeed, but… how might it touch the topic of Rolf and the horse?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yes…” she answered.  And then, after a breath, “I shall explain in full, m’lady.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">From there did Maria detail all she knew, from start to finish.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas during a visit paid to the Mernesse home by the Viscount Albeck and his son when she’d spotted their faces.  A sight awakening the old nightmare, as ‘twere, for in seeing them and knowing what devilry they concealed did Maria realise that I, too, would someday share in her despair… and more.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet in spite of it, she could not bring herself to tell Father.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;At the time, the master was mired in many pains, appealing to viscount-houses your hand in marriage.  And rightfully so…” she explained.  “It decided much, the marriage.  Of whether House Mernesse might continue… or crumble all to pieces.  That very burden was full-borne by the master.  How it weighed down his every waking hour was lost not even to me.  And so to trouble him further… with what but a mere memory from my six year-old self… I… I couldn’t…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You feared Father would’ve ill-heeded your warning, fraught as he was,” I summarised for her.  “I see now… a quandary, no doubt.  And that’s to say naught of accusing another noble house of wickedness.  A spark for commotion, ‘tis certain…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Indeed…  Thus I begged Lord Rolf for his aid.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And aid he lent, from her telling.  In her hour of greatest need, Rolf gave Maria his unwavering trust.  And from there did he head to the Albeck viscounty, but not before bidding Maria’s silence on this matter to everyone else.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My heart jumped upon the discovery.  “W-wait, I was kept deaf of all this?  Why?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“House Mernesse might’ve known misery had m’lady been apprised of the plot.  Such was Lord Rolf’s thought.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A sound one, at that, thinking on it…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The aristocratic sphere is ever fickle.  An ill-turn, and a noble house can be quickly spurned of its good graces, like a hidden dagger thrust into the belly, there to let the slow and agonising death run its course.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Had I, a mareschal of an Order, been found to be involved in prosecutions brought upon my own betrothed and his ennobled family, surely House Mernesse would’ve met a like fate, even should the charges be true and just.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Maria herself said as much, that my marriage to a viscount-house promised much foothold and security for House Mernesse.  Just as Father plied himself to bring the marriage to fruition, so did I toil away at my duties as mareschal to maintain my desirability as a bride… all for my family, ever tottering towards ruin as we were.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf was most wise to this, I’m sure.  And so did he find it unthinkable to have me involved in all that followed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Tis ill that a maidservant keeps secrets from her mistress,” said Maria.  “Pray forgive me, m’lady.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oh, dear Maria…  You’ve done naught that needs forgiveness,” I assured her.  “But of keeping secrets—did Rolf speak further of this?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yes.  He apologised for bidding my silence, and vowed that all else would be his to handle.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I see…”  My shoulders fell.  My heart sank.   “&#8230;That is very much like Rolf… isn’t it…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas from there on that he infiltrated the Albeck viscounty and the lord’s manor.  In just one wheeling of the sun, Rolf brought both viscount and son to justice—all by himself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Drunken dalliance” was his excuse at the hearing, a stupor of such severity so as to leave him empty of much recollection.  There were even those amongst the leadership who disparagingly proposed his patronage at some brothel, on account of him staying the night in town.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But that was not the way of it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No, not at all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf was risking his life to <i>save mine.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He had lent ear to Maria’s story and plea, made for the viscounty in the same evening, and before next nightfall, put an end to this tragedy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">One that had endured too long in the shadows.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">One that had so needlessly taken countless lives.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All of it, unravelled and undone in just one day.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf…  Ever our paragon.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ever gallant beyond all measure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Ever unsung in spite of all his sacrifices.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">“M’lady,” called Maria amidst my heavy thoughts.  “‘Twas here at headquarters where I stayed, on the same evening Lord Rolf had set out for the Albecks’ viscounty.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That I recall, yes,” I affirmed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And after nightfall did I fain visit the stables, that I might behold your royal steed.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…I knew then to what conclusion Maria was leading me.  A conclusion attested, yet hidden for many months for my sake.  A truth, sudden like lightning and colder than ice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;And beheld it you did, didn’t you?  As it… verily rested in the stables…” I said, increasingly penitent, “&#8230;after Rolf had already taken to the road.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Maria nodded softly.  “I did.  My eyes fooled me not; clearly I recall its grandeur as though ‘twere yesternight—the steed was a hulking warhorse, of the Reuscher breed.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All was then hushed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lost of all words for the moment—for the <i>revelation</i>—I felt next a dull and clenching pain in my bosom.  It throbbed with the hammer of guilt; it wrung with fingers of regret.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He’d done no ill.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">None at all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No… ‘tis more than that.  His conduct was just, in fact, and his heart was virtuous—he’d chosen the course most rightwise, even to his own suffering.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Oh, what droves have known deliverance by this single deed of his.  A deed done… all to save me from certain misery.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And what of I?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What have <i>I</i> done for Rolf?  What words have <i>I</i> given him?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…A “weakling”.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That was my former measure of him: a weakling too arrant to face his faults.  And I’d even gone so far as to lecture him on the conduct most beseeming of a knight… for I’d convinced myself that after abiding years of discrimination, of abuse and derision, he’d sallowed into a coistril of a coward.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But not only that.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">When tidings began trickling in of his accomplishments at Ström, I’d thought Rolf to be regaining the gallantry of his former days, to be shedding that shameful husk of his, at long last.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What wrongness there was in me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What <i>shame</i> that should rightfully have been <i>mine.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There was naught for Rolf to regain, naught for him to shed.  For ever and always has he been the Rolf that I’ve known, the Rolf that I’ve loved… right from our very first days together here at the Order.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The hearing…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas then that Rolf denied the fault, that the horse was set loose by his hands.  Verily did he keep silent of his whereabouts as to before and after the horse’s vanishing, yes, but that very silence was a shield, protecting me from the perilous knowledge of the Albeck incident.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet that’s not to say such an alibi was ever needed.  We had nary a speck of proof of his wrongdoing, and Rolf himself steadfastly denied all involvement.  What’s more, ‘twas an occurrence during his leave, on a day when the horse was not his charge.  By rights, the fault should never have fallen to him, a detail he’d clearly emphasised before us all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Even then, despite the soundness of his reasoning, I did not lend Rolf an ear as I should have.  Indeed… I gave him none of my trust.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My gift, instead, was repudiation.  Of loosening the leashes upon the leadership as they howled at and harried him, of looking down on him from my high seat and demanding from him an undue apology.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I can hear it again, that moment, echoing clarion in the recesses of my mind.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Rolf…<br />
…You shall apologise at once…’</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The voice of authority.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Cold and cutting.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf is a virtuous soul.  ‘Tis not in his compass to apologise for a sin not his own.  But perhaps… perhaps, he might’ve wavered, I think.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Just for a moment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Just for me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He might’ve realised that the commotion was more empty noise than aught else, that he had but to bend the knee and bow his head, and then all would be as it once was.  That his days spent by my side could yet endure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But such wavering tricked him not.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For Rolf Buckmann is ever a soul set upon his path.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;I hereby discharge you from your service…<br />
…and exile you from our Order…’</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet with a gaze one ought never turn to a beloved…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With a timbre never meant to strike cherished ears…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…did I send that very soul into exile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Returning to the moment, I found myself hunched, both arms tightly wound about myself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So cold.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Without Rolf, ‘twas oh so very cold…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“M’lady…  Pray forgive me…”  Maria looked on with all grief in her eyes.  “&#8230;’Tis I centred in this ill circle.  In hoping to help you did I only hurl Lord Rolf far from your side…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Nay…” I shook my head, nigh-shivering.  “Nay… Maria.  The fault’s not yours.  Not at all…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Indeed, Maria had only chosen the rightest of courses, and I had my life to thank for it.  Opposite was I.  Starkly so, for in this entire affair have I committed to only the most mistaken of paths.  A path certain to be severed short, were the Albecks yet left to their devices.  There was no longer any doubt left in me: the tragedies they’d meted unto their victims would’ve easily been my own to suffer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet ‘twas a fact that the Albecks’ criminality hinged upon one child’s memory of eight years past, a feather of a recollection against the unceasing momentum of an aristocratic marriage…  And the prime mover of that momentum: my own father, striving each day that I might be wed to a family more rooted and renowned than our own.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Hence Maria’s decision to seek Rolf’s aid.  ‘Twas most certainly her only choice… and more certain again the best she could’ve made, for Rolf trusted to her memory and became an ally, true and whole-hearted.  Inheriting Maria’s cause, he next sprang to action in hopes that I would be spared a woeful end, of quailing in some dark corner of a dungeon, undressed of all dignity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And after the villains were brought to justice, Rolf did not gloat of his deeds, no.  He kept silent.  The truth, the intent, the circumstance—all were concealed, and he was surely in the right for it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But suppose I had been apprised.  Just the knowledge itself would’ve been dangerous enough, even had I stayed myself from all involvement.  And suppose further it came to light that I’d known all along.  Surely much ill would’ve beset my family and myself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet such was not so.  I was kept unapprised, and for my own good.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still… unknowing of it all, I still could’ve <i>trusted</i> to Rolf.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Trusted to his silence.  Trusted to his defiance.  Trusted to his character.  Then surely would he still be here by my side, with this incident just a shade before all the light shining ahead of us.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But I didn’t… and there laid my error.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Trust” was instead “doubt”, sooner convincing me instead that Rolf had only to bow his head, and all would be settled and forgiven.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What… what am I to do…?” I whispered, giving air to my despair.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas mere months ago that Rolf was in this very room.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But now… now, he’s gone.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The one I wish most to be here beside me…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…was now gone from all sight and touch.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Maria’s was a look of dear worry as I then cast mine down, heavy with the weight of all the revelations, the realisations… the regret.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas then that a rapid knock came upon the chamber door.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Madame!  An urgency!” cried a muffled voice.  A rush of action and into the room came an officer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What’s the matter?” I asked, springing to my feet.  A closer look, and I saw the officer to be heated with panick.  He seemed to have run all the way here, for his breaths were quick and rasping.  “Why, you wheeze from haste!  Be at ease, my ears are yours.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“P… pardon, madame,” he answered.  In half a moment, he spoke again.  “Mareschal—it’s Central.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Next did he relay the news.  In them were words beyond immediate comprehension.  Nay—’twas simply that I refused to believe my ears.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;What?” I gasped.  <i>“&#8230;How?</i>  That… no…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Details are scant,” the officer continued.  “But Central is certain—very certain.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas preposterous.  Such a thing should never be.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘…Balasthea has fallen…’</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Struck out of all my wits, I trembled in dread till at last, my mind soon scrambled for reasons, for cause, for aught that might vouch for the contrary.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What had befallen upon Balasthea?  Upon Ström itself?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Was the advantage not theirs?  The momentum?  The victories of late?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What of the margrave?  His Fiefguard?  They had numbers enough; what were they doing?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…And Rolf.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What’s happened to Rolf?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">If the fort did truly fall, then as its commandant, Rolf most certainly would not have gone unscathed.  Would that he were only taken prisoner, but… knowing him, he might’ve bared the sword and joined the fray.  And if so… odylless and ill-matched as he is, his final moments might’ve been without mercy.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Final…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Is he dead, then?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf… is dead…?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All because of me?  Because I sent him there?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The very thought was a blow to my every nerve.  I clenched my bosom at once, to still the urge to weep and vomit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nay, he’s alright.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf is yet alive.  ‘Tis certain.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He must be.  He <i>has</i> to be.  The fates wouldn’t be so cruel.  Not after all he’s suffered.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No, he’s hardly alone.  Felicia is there, as well.  ‘Twas a week ago, very soon after the screening, that she took leave to head for Ström.  She is the strongest of our sorcerers, a champion of the 5th.  With her, all is well.  I know it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf and Felicia both are yet sound.  They must be.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In trying to convince myself of it, I shook my head vigorously to expel the ill thoughts creeping in.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Madame,” the officer spoke again.  “A conference convenes on this very matter—Central’s magisters will soon bid your presence, I presume.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Yes,” I answered.  “Of course they will.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Overwhelmed as I was, I could not know that in that very moment, the curtains had been drawn, unveiling strife of terrible scale.  The times were now as a violent river, roaring as it swallowed up each and every one of us.  Indeed, we were as paper boats set adrift upon the rapids, scarce able to choose our course.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet there was one soul standing against that tide.  A soul that has hitherto stayed his own course against all odds.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With my heart filling with thoughts for him, I looked to the high window and beyond.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There did dark-steel skies roll and rumble on, as though to augur all that was to come.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas violet vesper-light when I arrived at Arbel, having put Balasthea behind me upon finding Brother absent from its battlements.  As I strolled through the streets, bound for his abode, my thoughts turned to dear Emilie.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Oh, such misery that she abides.  I well-recall that clouded countenance of hers, seen a week past, right as my carriage cantered off for Ström.  As mareschal, hers is a station staying all recourse for my brother’s return: though Emilie wishes it, she cannot will it.  The reality wrings her ruesomely.  The pain is painted bare upon her portance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How did it come to this?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How might it be mended?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Caught cold in the corner, Emilie has scant comfort for these aching questions.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A most gentle soul she is.  Though it need not be said.  For even as Brother is as he is, Emilie yet frets for his welfare and future.  Hence did I resolve to shoulder her worries atop all my own and make haste to this margravate, that I might meet with Brother and enquire in full his deaf ears for Emilie’s call.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Rolf Buckmann” be his name, that brother of mine.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Staunch and steady as a mountain, ever is he the apple of any eye laid upon him… once upon a time.  For the recent years have borne witness to a change in him.  Oh, change comes to us all, of course  Even mountains can be moved, <i>unmade</i> with the passing of many ages.  But the change I saw in that man was one I could scarce suffer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">We are of the living, born and blessed with breath.  As trees grow given nurture and nutriment, so do we with the wheeling of the seasons.  But just as a sapling might quail in the sprouting, so might a man fail in his maturing.  A man like my brother.  Emilie and I have done our fair share, of cutting our teeth and coming into our own.  What woe we knew when the third amongst us remained yet the child.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘A prodigy at ten, a prince at fifteen, a plebeian at twenty.’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Words a wistful soul once said; ‘twould seem of such precocious sprouts, many find note only in their sooner years than the later.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But my brother’s—that man’s is a marring more lamentable again than a mere idiom can encapsulate.  His is a fall to but a foundling of no accomplishment, no recognition, no worth.  We each brave the buffeting of our many moons and winters, that we buds might bloom and attain to our fullest beauty.  Such be our path, precious and shared.  Our lives are much too long to be defined by the feats and faults of our most fleeting years.  And so must they be remembered as they are: mere memories, of small meaning by any measure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Would that Brother faced his flaws and assayed aught within his means.  But he instead remained the pup chasing a speedier dream.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I know well that his dawns and dusks, of every day of every year, are filled with the swish-swashes of his sword swings.  Though I am loath to disparage his discipline, ‘tis but a jest, a child’s play that he pretends—just as a boy would twirl a twig and proclaim himself slayer of some mighty, make-believe monster.  Has that not always been so of late?  That Brother’s sword is looks more a toy than a tool of war?  For how long has it been since last his edge carved out victory?  How long since last it reached aught but air?  A sword wasting on with every swing: such is the weapon he wields.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My brother, in short, keeps shut his eyes to the imperatives of his plight.  That he savoured only bitter silence in communing with Yoná was most miserable and unfortunate, yes… but that need not be so powerful an impetus to perish all hope, to founder in folly deeper still.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Reflect, and with mustered courage for the first step, begin again the grand journey—a trying trial, true, but a trial my brother has abandoned, despite what wonders might await him.  Thus does his life linger, losing all chance for achievement.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Why, then?  Why does he not choose the brighter way?  Are the soot-like shadows such solace to him?  He has known much loss, of course, but not all is lost.  Oh, why does he not realise this?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And that’s to touch nothing of the hearing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What despair I knew on that day…  Dire and dour despair.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Had he confessed and made amends, no pain, no punishment would’ve been his to suffer.  For Emilie was set—nay, most <i>willing</i> to forgive all his grievances, come what may.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A word.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Just a word.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A genuine word of apology would’ve well-sufficed.  And then all would’ve been as wind.  But stubborn in his ways, Brother scorned the solution and sowed his own undoing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For the woman he loved, he delivered not on her one desire.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For his beloved, he uttered not the one word she wished most to hear.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A woman he ought’ve loved and cherished above all else.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But that brother of mine is now only a man ill-loving strength and ill-cherishing wisdom.  ‘Tis a most bitter and lamentable reality that I must swallow, and yet…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“This seems the place,” I thought aloud.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twould appear my stride was made fleet by all this frustration, for I now found myself arrived at my brother’s abode sooner than scheduled.  And so taking a breath, I knocked upon the door.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Mm…?”  I blinked a moment later.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No answer had come.  Was he elsewhere, perhaps?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How splendid.  Seven days spent in travel to the very verge of the kingdom, and not here nor at the fort could I meet him. </p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Stilling the familiar frustration from steaming over, I rummaged my purse and produced a key—duplicate, and borrowed from Balasthea.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Into the lock it went.  With a twist, the door cracked open.  A hush sighed forth from within.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“His house…” I whispered to myself, “&#8230;his home.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I stepped in.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The floorboards gave a wooden groan, echoing through the distinct silence of an uninhabited abode.  Lamps were unlit.  The evening dim was daring to settle in, yet there was brightness enough from the twilight to illume the interior.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Deeper in I went, glancing about with wordless breaths.  ‘Twas a sizeable home, rightly becoming of a commandant’s quarters.  And spick-and-span besides: the counters were well-appointed, the furnishings well-arranged, the surfaces well-dusted.  Though hardly strange: if there was aught his years of swainhood have honed in my brother, ‘twas the quality of his housekeeping, I must admit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hm…?” There at the dining table: two chairs.  And set on the shelves: more receptacles and utensils than a lone resident might require.  “&#8230;For the seldom guest, surely.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I could scarce conceive what soul should crave his company, but I suppose even an acting commandant must stand ready to receive the errant visitor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Shaking my head briefly, I ventured further in, arriving at the bedchamber.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And… here he sleeps.  Every night…” I observed under my breath.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Unlike Emilie and myself, Brother took bed in the barracks when he was yet in the Order.  A curious irony that banishment should bring him a boon of private room and board.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And speaking of beds, his was of sheets rippling with nary a wrinkle, upon closer look.  Not too queer, thinking on it.  His is a scrupulous mind, my brother’s.  Though… is it even in a man to make his bed so neatly, I wonder?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;He wouldn’t dare.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas during the hearing when doubts were raised as to whether Brother might’ve bought himself a brothel-maiden for a night.  I had a mind to also enquire this very matter from him, but truth be told, I doubted not his chastity.  After all, to this moment does Emilie so wearily worry for him—a great pain of no profit, for their betrothal is all but long broken, ‘tis certain.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thus it appals reason that he would so brazenly patronise a bawdy-house when his beloved yet sheds sweat and tears for his welfare.  Indeed, not then, nor now.  However much a bumbling fool he may be, I yet believe Brother above the vice of dalliance, at the very least.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…In the midst of my own profitless worries did my annoyance for that man boil all the more bubblingly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Haa…”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sighing aloud, I let myself fall abruptly onto his bed…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;hh…”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…and burying my face in his blankets, I breathed in with all deepness.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Oh, where has he gone?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">If his holiday be today and on, then at least was he here till yesternight.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Here in this house… on this very bed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Why…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Why hadn’t he come?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Come to answer Emilie’s call?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">She’d prepared the very post for him.  The chief adjutant’s seat—all his for the taking.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet take he did not.  Come, he did not.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not for Emilie.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not for me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;mm…”</i> I muttered again, gazing at the blankets turning blue with even-gloam from the skylight above.  A colour Brother had no doubt savoured many a time till his slumber.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Brother…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">However weak he’s become, however much of a fool he’s fashioned himself, that man yet earns none of my enmity, none of my scorn.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">None…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That man, that brother of mine…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I dare not hate him, no.  And I neither wish to forsake him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">We’re family, after all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Siblings, bound by the same blood.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A bond that shall not break.  A bond that can never break.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Siblings… siblings, we are…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Then shall I be the patient sister and speak with him duly.  I know all that I must do: ask of his absence at the screening, discuss with him at length the many matters that wound us, and then…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…and then, I’ll bring him back.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Back to Emilie, for she is mistress to her own house and barony now.  The house of Valenius, burgeoning with ever greater clout and prestige.  Take her hand, and surely shall Brother know a home of much welcome—more so than any other.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And yet… he’s not here.  Where, then…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Whispering such, I rolled about till I was aface the ceiling.  There I spotted the boughs of a great beech beyond the skylight, one very much like another that stood in the mists of my childhood.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Once upon a time, I clambered up a tree—too far up, to my fright.  The ground below seemed to stretch dizzyingly away.  How lost, how lonely I felt.  And so I did what I’d often done in those nascent years: I cried and cried, quivering amidst my many sniffles and snivels.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But then, Brother came.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And up the tree he climbed, big and towering though its trunk was.  Up and up to the high boughs of my stranding.  And with his succour, his comfort, all was well again.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Wheresoever I was, he would be.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Dear Brother…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Turning to another window across the room, my sight settled upon a nearby desk.  ‘Twas of the smallish sort, neatly assorted with parchments, papers, and manuals of military defence—a sign that he’d saddled himself with his duties, even here in his home, where duty should shackle him little.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Some inkling of earnestness yet endured him, then, from the look of it.  For his post as acting commandant, for the wellbeing of Balasthea.  The war, too, was faring well here, from all I’ve heard.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I wonder: why does he not devote the same energies, the same expertise to the Order?  The rigours he faces here are little different from those of a chief adjutant, after all.  Why, then?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still, withal has he finally joined the fray of our holy war, the long-fought battle to bring a lasting end to the Nafílim.  I knew some gladness in that, at least.  And he does, as well, I’m sure.  Though that brother of mine had best not let his sudden successes get to that pate of his.  He is yet weak—much too weak to swing the sword where the fray burns fiercest.  Wield it, and he wields his own ruin.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A thought occurred to me then.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Albeit a most absurd one.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What if…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…what if Brother and I were to measure our mettle against one another?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A farce of a duel, ‘twould certainly be.  What mettle has he in him?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Mm…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Indeed, I ought serve him a slap or three.  Reveal to him this reality, remind him of where he truly belongs…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Or perhaps not.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nay.  The folly lies in me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A bumbling fool Brother may be, but what good would come of it?  Of laying him low out of his wits?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Right, then.  ‘Tis but a fleeting fancy to fight him.  Naught but a fancy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yes… a fancy.  A future never to fruit…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Atop his bed was coldness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sheets like a wintry wind, warmth long-forgotten.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No matter how dearly I search…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…no matter where I touch…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…his warmth met me not.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How tired I was.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All because of him, surely, for mightily does he move me with myriad worries.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ill-able to stay the tides of sleepiness, I gave myself to the brisk cold of his bed and let my eyes fall to a close.</p>
