<h2 style="text-align:center;">Ⅳ</h2>

<p>Evergreen verdure blurred on by as we galloped fast to Mia’s fallen home.</p>
<p>Our path was that of a Nafílim marching route, laid for its leniency of travel: the trees sprouted spaciously from one another, and so was our horse-speed haste unhindered.  A haste for which awaited only trouble with the waning of the noon-hours in this woodland.  Thus did we stop and make camp as the last sunrays buried themselves beneath the horizon.</p>
<p>Smoke soon rose; our fire for the night was made.  Between us it burned as we sat ourselves upon sundered tree-trunks.  I then went about preparing supper: slices of hard cheese and hearty ham.  Their aromas quickly wafted against the warm glow of the fire, but I did not keep Mia waiting for long.  To her, I handed a generous share.</p>
<p>“&#8230;thank you…”</p>
<p>Yet wait she did, seemingly loath to have a morsel in her mouth before one could be had in mine.  Table manners—likely instilled in her not by the callous hands of the slavers, but the wisdom of her parted parents.</p>
<p>Seeing this, I sliced up my own share in a hurry, and supper was soon set.</p>
<p>“Many thanks for this meal.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;many thanks for this meal…”</p>
<p>Whilst chewing the cheese, I gazed into the flame, finding in it a beckoning for reflection.</p>
<p>All has gone as well as I’d hoped.  Our journey is mostly trodden—only a bit further now till we should find ourselves at the village proper.  An early morning arrival, I reckon, were we to set out again at the break of dawn.</p>
<p>My eyes turned up from the fire on a whim, finding Mia quietly helping herself to her meal.</p>
<p>“Here, Mia.  Some water,” I said, handing her my waterskin.  Taking it, she then attempted to untie the cord locking its nozzle, but it proved too Gordian a knot for her dainty fingers.  “Stubborn, is it?  Let me.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;oh… yes…”</p>
<p>I summarily undid the cord, and handed the whole thing back to Mia.</p>
<p>“&#8230;thank you… Master…”</p>
<p>“Not at all.  It’s an old one, that waterskin.  The cord’s gone stiff,” I confessed as Mia sipped away.  “Been with me for a decade and more it has, ever since my days back at the barony.”</p>
<p>To the waterskin she then looked.  Her eyes glinted with thoughtfulness.</p>
<p>“&#8230;it’s… precious to you…?”</p>
<p>“Precious?  I suppose so.  Very much so, in fact.”</p>
<p>I knew then some relief.  Mia’s heart was finally on the mend, enough to join in on some idle chatter.  Steeled by the thought, I looked to her once more.  Mere chatter could not remain so for long.  Not when much weighed upon her frail shoulders.</p>
<p>“Mia.  It’s my whim that’s brought us here.  And it’s tomorrow that’ll bring you your answer, ill or no,” I broached, gazing at her flame-illuminated face.  “&#8230;Are you afraid?”</p>
<p>With all softness of motion did she shake her head.  “&#8230;you’re right… Master…” she answered.  “&#8230;not knowing… hurts…”</p>
<p>Of course it would.</p>
<p>In her heart: a hurting, burning question, quenchable only by an answer from her sister, Eva.  Whether it be the embrace of a warm reunion, or the silence of a cold corpse, the truth must be known, that little Mia might at last move on.</p>
<p>To her resolve, I nodded.</p>
<p>“We come on another errand, as well,” I went on.  “Mia.  Our covenant, the thrallspell—I mean to have it undone.”</p>
<p>Mia and I, we were slave and master respectively, a bond writ in the thrallspell woven upon the day of her purchase.  The laws of Londosius forbade the breaking of it, and so I thought to have the deed done elsewhere.  Namely, in Nafílim lands, by Nafílim magicks.</p>
<p>“Should prove a task easy enough, even for a run-of-the-mill wiċċa.  Only, I know of none.  Do you, Mia?</p>
<p>“&#8230;wiċċan… there lived some… in my village, I think… but…” she recalled, only to turn to the campfire.  “&#8230;maybe… not anymore…”</p>
<p>And then, a small lull, filled with the crackling of the fire, the rustling of the foliage, the chirps and drones of distant critters.  At its end, Mia looked to me again.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Hensen…” she said anew, “&#8230;maybe in Hensen…”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>
<p>The <i>fólkheimr</i> of Hensen.</p>
<p>A large settlement, like a capital, where sat the jarl: chieftain and ruler of the Nafilim of these parts.  I’d committed to memory the markings of a map, which, if it serves, situated Hensen a full-day’s horseride from Mia’s village.</p>
<p>My eating slowed as I ruminated further.  Of Hensen.  Of the journey ahead, now prolonged.  Of cutting the chains between us.  But in so doing did I notice her looking intently upon me.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Master…” her lips parted.  “&#8230;you don’t need me… anymore…?”</p>
<p>My brows raised.  But a thought, and I then found them furrowing.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Mia.  I take pains to be as sympathetic a friend as I can.  But a word of nonsense, and even I can be moved to anger,” I explained calmly.  “Friends need one another.  And you, Mia: you’re my friend.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“What’s not needed is the thrallspell binding us.  That’s all.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes…” she said, gazing down again.  “&#8230;I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>“Very good,” I nodded.  “And just the same, you can be rightly angry should you ever hear silliness from my own lips, Mia.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Silly indeed, my lips.  I oft speak ill or out of turn, especially to girls such as you, Mia.  I tread ‘round needles, ever afraid I might air some folly.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;it’s all right… Master…”</p>
<p>What is, I wonder?</p>
<p>Much of what I say of late has only ever earned me misconstruance or scorn.  Thus have I found myself given to misgivings about my speech.  Worrying whether or not I’ve adequately communicated my point.  Worrying whether or not I’ve aired unwise words.  Worrying if I’m none the wiser in spite of it.</p>
<p>But I suppose worrying is in itself warrant enough to how prone my faculties of speech were to the faux pas.  A troubling thought, truth be told.  Though another weighed more heavily to tear me away from it.</p>
<p>I took a breath.</p>
<p>“Another matter, Mia.  One I must make plain.  Should we find your sister alive and well…” I broached again, pausing, “&#8230;then it’s by her side where you belong.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>Mia sat silent.</p>
<p>Words unsought, perhaps, but none that could be rebutted.  She had lost everything.  But if, by chance, there remained aught at all, then she ought keep it, and dearly.</p>
<p>“Come now, Mia.  Get some sleep while you can.  We leave at dawn.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;all right…”</p>
<p>With a spirit seemingly unsettled, Mia obliged, wrapping herself in a blanket and laying down upon the warmed grasses.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>The night waxed.  The forest slept.</p>
<p>Under the canopy of foliage and far-flung stars was Mia’s slumbering face.  Her features flustered in the dancing glow of the campfire as it popped and crackled quietly on.</p>
<p>I poked the flame, stoking its embers.  Its airy hum, its spittle and sparks—there was a romance to the sound, one I well-liked.  No doubt an unmatched complement to a benighted scene.</p>
<p>Our journey—it has gone well.</p>
<p>Taking Mia along demanded a milder route, an account I heeded with much care.  And thanks to my efforts, our travels have been untroubled thus far.</p>
<p>Tomorrow, then.  Tomorrow shall we know the worth of our quest.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;mm…”</i></p>
<p>Mia rustled in her blanket.  Her eyes awoke.  And to me they looked as she sat up.</p>
<p>“I know, Mia.”</p>
<p>It would seem she had in her a sensitivity to the presence of others.  Perhaps born from some innate magick—or from long fearing the fury of Men.  Whichever the case, she sensed something nearing anew: the stirring of beasts.</p>
<p>I might’ve been too comforted by the easy course of our journey.  Comfort the fates oft find too fresh a hare to harrow for their own humour.  And I was to them a mark of much worth, for it seems that with but a fancy of relief do I well-tempt their wiles.</p>
<p>“Stay beside the fire.  I’ll handle them.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes, Master…”</p>
<p>I rose and readied myself.  Afore, far in the dark, emerged our bestial visitors.</p>
<p>Wood-wolves.  A pack of four, each a half-passus and more from head to haunch.  No behemót were they, but such was of little solace in the face of their uncanny wit—uncanny enough to rout Men and savour their flesh, a meal they would partake in with their packs from time to time.</p>
<p>Now, being one of them.</p>
<p>A shorter blade serves more soundly than a full sword, at this rate.  Thinking so, I took up my knife nearby and faced the wolven prowlers.  They crept closer and closer still, deliberate in their pace.  My eyes left them not once as I gripped and tore a blanket with my blade, the shreds of which I then wound about my left forearm.</p>
<p>Patience possessed each of their paws as they edged in.  Their eyes sharply measured the distance to our camp as they continuously calculated the best time and position to strike.  Uncanny wit, indeed.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the forte was found also within me.  They all intended to pounce and strike in concert; I intended to disallow them the opening.  Thus did I step forth at an angle, abruptly breaking the equilibrium and placing me closer to two of the beasts.</p>
<p>The move ignited some spark: at once, the two lunged forth.</p>
<p>Divide and conquer was the name of the game.  When faced with many, fight them afew.  The first two’s instinctive attack proved their blunder; it was they that would be dealt with first.</p>
<p>Just as quickly did I raise my left arm, wedging its wrapped length in the flying maw of one wolf.  The jaw snapped shut.  Pain was absent: wolven fangs are long and keen, but not enough to pierce so layered a protection.</p>
<p>A chance.</p>
<p>In my right hand, the knife.  From below, up it shot, deep into the throat of the arm-biting wolf.</p>
<p>Air and blood spewed.  Life left its lungs.</p>
<p>But thereafter did I immediately stoop down low.</p>
<p>Where my windpipe once was, now was surrounded by another set of enclosing fangs: the second wolf, taking the split-second chance to leap and snap at my throat.  Only, I had the same idea.</p>
<p>In that slice of a second, I glanced and gleaned its flying form from below.  My knife flashed up.  Its blade bored into the beast’s jugular.  Blood and bones gurgled and cracked.</p>
<p>Taking on the wolves as they dart about the dirt would’ve proven too unfavourable a fight.  It is only when they take to the air that they are unguarded.  Thankfully the tactic worked: not more than two seconds in, and already two of their number were ended.</p>
<p>But now the knife was lost.  Too jammed was its blade in folds of hide and crevices of bone.  Hesitation would herald my own end, and so I abandoned the thing altogether.</p>
<p>Two down.  Two left.  To them, I faced.</p>
<p>As if noting the loss of my knife, the wolves made winds of themselves and gusted my way.  But I knew their course: in anticipation did I align with their warpath, that the two could not assail me both at once.</p>
<p>The third was closer; the fourth trailed a ways behind.  Seeing this, I focused on the former and thrust forth my left hand, straight into its lunging maw.  Right as its snout snapped shut, I clenched my fingers into a fist, for in them was now its tongue.</p>
<p>A wood-wolf’s bite is a terror to behold, but its licker can only lick.  And of things to behold, the power of my grip is my point of pride.  The beast knew for itself why, for as its tongue was clutched without mercy, it found its jaw incapable of closing.</p>
<p>I followed the wolf’s leaping trajectory and threw it to the ground.  My full weight was imbued into my knee as I then slammed it into the side of the beast’s jugular.  Here was it weak of hide and muscle, and so did I give one final heave of my weight.</p>
<p>A crack—muted by flesh and fluids.  The wolf’s spinal cord was crushed.</p>
<p>Yet the moment was unfinished.  Already was the last wolf sailing straight at me.  I ducked, missing my assailant by half a hair’s breadth.  I then rebounded, ready to meet another attack, only to find the beast’s momentum unturned.</p>
<p>In that instant, I knew.</p>
<p>This pack—it was well-practised in harassing our upright species.</p>
<p>The wolves learnt early on that we tallfolk kept our bags bedight with all manner of earthly delights.  What the last of the pack picked, then, was not our flesh, but our rucksack, laying near the fire.</p>
<p>To it, the wolf rushed, rousing fear in our steed nearby.  The horse neighed wildly and retreated, leaving Mia alone.</p>
<p>I screamed.</p>
<p>“Mia!  Away from the sack!  <i>Now!”</i></p>
<p>But my words went unheeded.  For whatever reason, Mia herself ran towards the rucksack.</p>
<p>Through it she then rummaged.</p>
<p>The wolf lunged.</p>
<p>I followed, dashing in.</p>
<p>There, taking something into her hands, Mia fell aside, beholding the beast as it snapped and tore away at the baggage, scattering our rations.</p>
<p>In another instant did I myself lunge, bringing my entire body down upon the wolf from behind.  My arms locked fast around its neck, and with all mustered might, squeezed and constricted it.</p>
<p>The wolf writhed with rage under my weight.  A struggle stretching on for three minutes and more, during which I relented not a single bit in denying its lungs of air.  Slowly, slowly, slowly, its wrath faded, along with its life.</p>
<p>And then…</p>
<p>Serenity, once more.</p>
<p>The crackling of the campfire.</p>
<p>The whispers of the trees.</p>
<p>The chirps and trills of nocturnal fauna.</p>
<p>Breaths yet quick, I released the wolf and rose.  After making certain that it was, indeed, now a carcass, I turned and went fast to Mia’s side.</p>
<p>There she sat, right beside the ravaged rucksack.  And upon her person, no wound or graze that I could glean.</p>
<p>“Mia…” I said, relieved.</p>
<p>“&#8230;M… Mas… ter…  I…” she quiveringly murmured.  “&#8230;y… your… precious…”</p>
<p>Clasped tight in her arms was my waterskin.</p>
<p>Verily did she save it from the wolf’s violence.  A deathly wager, all for the old, “precious” bag of water.</p>
<p>Should I rebuke her for such recklessness?</p>
<p>Nay.</p>
<p>Down to her I knelt.</p>
<p>Into her eyes, I gazed.</p>
<p>“Mia.  Thank you.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>On and on, the night whispered by.</p>
<p>The campfire yet crackled and breathed between us.  Mia sat across, bound up in a blanket, but seemingly scarce of the spirit of sleep—not after so wild a wolven invasion.</p>
<p>It was then that she unshrouded herself of the warming cover, and with it in her arms, stepped over to my side.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Master…” she said, “&#8230;here…”</p>
<p>An offering of her blanket, perhaps out of pity, for my own was unmade in the midst of the struggle.  It laid nearby, sundered to shreds, a sight Mia had been fixed upon for some while now.</p>
<p>I shook my head.  “That’s yours, Mia.”</p>
<p>Her shoulders drooped.  “&#8230;all right…”</p>
<p>Never has Mia insisted against my word.  The same held true here, and so with a visage veiled in sorrow, she slowly began her way back.</p>
<p>“Mia,” I called to her.  “Come.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes…?”</p>
<p>On her return, I took the blanket from her arms.  Enshrouding my shoulders with it, I then held up Mia herself…</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;ah…”</i></p>
<p>…and sat her down right before me.  And after enclosing my arms around her, we watched the fire together.</p>
<p>A rare moment of gladness for the sheer girth of my body, for it well-sheltered her small figure.  Comforted by the thought, I then more snugly surrounded us both in the blanket.</p>
<p>“It’s coldest now till dawn.  We’ll be warmer this way.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes, Master…”</p>
<p>A murmur of an answer, accompanied with a nod.  The fire popped and pittered on, its pall of warmth waxing and waning under the weight of the night sky.</p>
<p>“You were brave there, Mia,” I broached, “saving my waterskin like you did.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;no… I…”</p>
<p>“But you should know.  Both it and you are precious to me.”  A pause, and a shake of the head.  “Nay…  You, more so.  Be not too reckless from here on, will you Mia?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I will…”</p>
<p>“Very good.  Still, you have my thanks,” I said, before patting her softly on the head.  “A tad thrilling for a night, wasn’t it?  Can’t catch a wink now.  Not with these frayed nerves.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;me, too…”</p>
<p>A lull.</p>
<p>With tired intent, we gazed into the fire, our faces aflush from the redness of the rising sparks.</p>
<p>“Say, Mia.  You’re attuned to the covenants, yes?” I began again.  “Which sort, exactly?  I’d like to tell you my name, if its nature permits.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;that… I don’t know…”</p>
<p>Indeed.  Even now, Mia knew not my name.</p>
<p>The covenantal magicks confer upon their recipients some influence, the manner of which are as myriad as the stars above us.  By her words, Mia was not yet wise to what she was able.  It follows, then, that controlling it was a forgone conclusion.</p>
<p>“&#8230;bad things… might happen…” she went on, “&#8230;so… I can’t…”</p>
<p>“Can’t know my name,” I finished for her, sighing.  “&#8230;Of course not.”</p>
<p>Our little fire sputtered on, spilling up its sparks from time to time.</p>
<p>How quiet the benighted woods were.  Quiet enough that had I let my mind drift off for long, I might’ve thought Mia and I were the only ones under the bountiful boughs.</p>
<p>A peaceful moment.</p>
<p>And thus, the perfect moment.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Mia,” I said heavy-heartedly.  “&#8230;I must confess.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes, Master…?”</p>
<p>“I’m…  I’m a commander in this war.  I give orders.  I make decisions.  It’s my livelihood.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Your father, he… he was killed by one of my men,” came the words I dreaded most to air.  “&#8230;It was during a pursuit.  One I well-forsook.  But the soldiers lent no ear.  So they instead chased down your father and his brethren, and… and…”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“&#8230;It’s all my fault, Mia.  I couldn’t reign in my own men.  I couldn’t stop the killing.  I couldn’t save your father.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“And all that’s happened to your family, your friends, your home—my hands, too, are bloodied with them, I think.”</p>
<p>With those words, I found my fingers clenched in a fist.</p>
<p>“&#8230;I came to this land.  Took up the post.  Turned things ’round.  That’s when the war here began to change.  Enough to give Men more daring than before.  Enough to birth a massacre.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>“I…”</p>
<p>And then, upon that fist, warmth.</p>
<p>The warmth of Mia’s little hand, alighting upon my own.</p>
<p>“Mia…?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;there is blood… on both sides…  everyone… has something precious to protect…  that is war…” she spoke at length.  “&#8230;this… Papa said to me…”</p>
<p>“&#8230;He did, did he…”</p>
<p>“&#8230;when I saw them… the Men… I knew…  they would have come for us anyway…  whether next month… or next year… no matter what…”</p>

<p>A point most certain.</p>
<p>Even before Balasthea’s fortunes were turned, the Fiefguard had ventured no few forays into these Nafílim grounds.  To attack, to pillage…  Indeed, Mia’s village stood well within the path of that flood.  It was, perhaps, only a matter of time before its flows would come washing through.</p>
<p>An inevitable tragedy, then.  A consolation of rationality.  But one that ill-salved what sore misgivings I yet harboured for it all.</p>
<p>Oh, what a fool I am.</p>
<p>Numb-witted.  Wasting on with my follies.  Fumbling at every turn.</p>
<p>What good does it do?  To point the chiding finger?  Whether to myself or others?  Blood on my hands or no, our beloved lost are forever beyond all finding.</p>
<p>And suppose the fault lies not with me.  Suppose the fates had the tragedy jealously scribed into their fell script.</p>
<p>What of it?</p>
<p>Would accepting it prove to me the long-sought salve?</p>
<p>Nay.  To those dearly departed, whether from Mia’s violated village or in more massacres to come, these worries—they are all as whispers set the wind, for the dead, though solemn in their silence, see more clearly than the living ever can.</p>
<p>This, I know.</p>
<p>All too well.</p>
<p>But this barb upon my bosom pricked no less painfully.</p>
<p>Had I not come to this land, would Mia and her family have fared a different course?</p>
<p>Would they yet be whole and happy?</p>
<p>Together?</p>
<p>A hurting thought.</p>
<p>A haunting woe.</p>
<p>A visitor in all my waking hours.</p>

<p>“&#8230;Master…”</p>
<p>A gentle voice.</p>
<p>Like a hand, lifting me from the mire of my lamenting mind.</p>
<p>Mia’s voice.</p>
<p>Mia’s hand.</p>
<p>Small, yet strong.</p>
<p>Indeed, there was strength in her little fingers as they held fast my own hand.  More strength than I ever knew was in them.  And to know it only now was enough to have me taken aback.</p>
<p>“&#8230;it’s not your fault…  it’s not…” she said softly.  “&#8230;please… don’t be sad…”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Did I seem sad?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes… always…”</p>
<p>“‘Always’&#8230;”</p>
<p>Never have I thought the brand of the ungraced to be a burden.</p>
<p>Never have I let myself sink into sorrow in my time at the Order.</p>
<p>But since coming to this land, since meeting Mia—this entire time, I’ve been in pain.</p>
<p>This entire time…</p>
<p>…I’ve been sad.</p>
<p>“Mia…”</p>
<p>Long have I held back the tears.  Long have I denied them their due course.  On what account but some paper-thin pride.</p>
<p>And yet, I’ve been weeping away this whole time.</p>
<p>Weeping.  On and on.</p>
<p>Mia’s hand was upon mine.  And so upon it did I place my other.  And upon it did Mia do the same.</p>
<p>Our hands—all together.</p>
<p>“&#8230;finally… finally… you’ve opened up…”</p>
<p>In her voice was tenderness.  Vast, and warm.</p>
<p>“You’re right.  I’ve only ever wished to hear more of you… but somewhere along the way, I forgot to return the favour.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes…”</p>
<p>“Rather selfish of me, I admit.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;can I hear more…?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Of course, Mia,” I relented.  Looking up to the long dark, I let out a deep sigh.  “Right.  Where to begin…  Well.  For starters, it was my dream to become a knight.”</p>
<p>There, before the flickering fire, did I begin to tell my tale.</p>
<p>A tale of a cherished childhood.</p>
<p>A tale of an aggrieved ungraced.</p>
<p>A tale of many battles, fraught and hard-fought.</p>
<p>Nothing was hid in the telling.  All was laid bare.  Unsung happenings, untold thoughts—these and all were reminisced to Mia in the warmth of a wavering flame.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>“&#8230;and that’s how I ended up here,” my voice carried through the wood.  “An unknighted coistril, exiled to these far reaches.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;your… your once-betrothed…” Mia wondered.  “&#8230;what of her…?”</p>
<p>“I’ve not seen her since.  Not once…”  My brows fell.  “&#8230;And perhaps, not ever again.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;oh…”</p>
<p>Across my arms then rolled a breath from Mia’s lips.  A curious sigh, one of sorrowed sympathy, or seeming security.</p>
<p>“&#8230;your family, too…?”</p>
<p>“Them, too, sadly enough.  Our paths are parted.  Blood’s our only bond now, really,” I gave a sigh of my own.  “I’m sorry.  I must seem the fool to you, Mia.  They’re all there, my family.  Alive and well.  And yet, I…”</p>
<p>“&#8230;no…  not at all…”</p>
<p>It was the cold truth that in all the five years I’d spent at the Order, not a moment of it was set aside to meet Mother and Father.  In fact, these feet had not found Buckmann soil in just as long.  For her part, Felicia was quite the contrary, having gone back and forth a few times.</p>
<p>My sister…</p>
<p>For her, I felt remorse.  Despite my circumstance, I played the good brother as best I could.  The role was ill-starred; I did naught but betray her hopes in the end.  “Heroic performance” indeed.  No wonder why she’s now withered of all warmth for me.</p>
<p>“Mother.  Father.  Thinking on it, neither of them ever had any love for me, really.  Of our time together, I scant recall,” I continued.  “What about you, Mia?  Any outings you’ve had with your own family?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes…” she answered, tinged with bittersweet brightness.  “&#8230;Hensen… once a year… we all visited Hensen…”</p>
<p>“Hm.  Warm memories, I wager.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;there’s lemonade… made only in Hensen…  my family… we all loved it…”</p>
<p>Family…</p>
<p>With the word echoing in me, I embraced Mia a tad more tightly.</p>
<p>“Let’s have some, then.  Together, in Hensen.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes…”</p>
<p>Should it be that the fates have denied Mia’s village of any further survivors, then our next course would indeed be the fólkheimr of Hensen.  There would we seek out a wiċċa to unchain the thrallspell binding Mia to me.</p>
<p>Though, entering the Nafílim bastion would prove the greater toil and, perhaps, my bane.  I am a kin of Man, after all.  The braves there would sooner welcome me with arrows and magicks than open arms.</p>
<p>It must be thought on.  I wished not for Mia to remain a slave for a second longer, thus did I dearly hope for a break in the clouds that might shine upon some path forward.</p>
<p>But in the meanwhile, Mia and I continued our conversation well through the night.  Of us both did we equally share, at times remembering happiness, and others, recalling sore nostalgia.</p>
<p>The hours sailed on by, and before we knew it, the skies began to brighten.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>Under the wheeling morrowlight we raced.</p>
<p>Evergreen woods soon gave way to wild grasses as our galloping horse hurried us into a new vista: open fields, an ocean of verdure swaying with the whistling winds.  Above vaulted the feather-cloud skies, its sun yet to take the noontide throne.</p>
<p>And just before us stood our destination—Mia’s village, and her harrowed home.</p>
<p>Nearing it, I slowed our steed to a canter.  Only, my heart drummed faster with dread.  Wishes, waning with each moment, were its only mitigation.</p>
<p>A wish for survivors.</p>
<p>A wish for a friend of Mia’s.  Or a neighbour.  Anyone at all that might know even just her face.</p>
<p>And a wish, dearest of all, for the well-being of Mia’s last sister: Eva.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>To be enlightened of the truth to this tragedy is enough, even if what awaits may be the discovery of one more loved one’s death.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>To finally set her first step to tomorrow, Mia must accept the very truth of this ruined yesterday.  Of whether her sister waits with a touch as warm as the clearest sun, or one as cold as any stone.</p>
<p>I know.</p>
<p>All too well.</p>
<p>Yet I could not help but hope for the better.  Hope, for a long-due measure of happiness for Mia.</p>
<p>It was then that we passed by the first fences and fallowed fields.  Here, my breaths were bated and broken.  But before me sat Mia, and from her petrified portance, I well-espied the anxiety holding her fast in its grip.</p>
<p>And with no ceremony, we then arrived at the village sprawl.</p>
<p>The withered walls, the wood-hewn houses, the shadowed sheds, the neglected gardens.</p>
<p>Mia’s home.</p>
<p>We were here at last.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>We dismounted, our feet finding the dirt carpeted with overgrown greenery.</p>
<p>Around us, a village, violated and vanished of its erstwhile vitality.  The houses sagged, heavy with black wounds burnt into their facades.  The fences, screens, and all manner of other buildings stood broken and beyond all recognition of their prior purposes.</p>
<p>And absent in all of this: the steps and breaths of any other soul besides Mia’s and mine.</p>
<p>The Fiefguard had indeed quit the place five moons past with not a single camp erected.  The rubble was barren of banners, a belt buckle or errant armament, or any article once bedighting the marauding Men.  Missing, too, were traces of any Nafílim enterprise in restoring these ruins.</p>
<p>It soon set in for us both.</p>
<p>The village was all but abandoned.</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>Mia stood there, still and silent, staring upon the husks of her home.  A place once beloved, but now changed forever.  What was reflected in those amber eyes of hers, I could not fathom.</p>
<p>Yet, I sensed uncanniness afoot.  For all the destruction wrought upon it, not one corpse laid upon the village courses.  The Fiefguardsmen certainly fostered nary a flicker of compassion for their foes, not even to spare them a pittance of a burial.  What explained this, then?</p>
<p>No…</p>
<p>Could it be?</p>
<p>That the fallen folk were buried by their brethren passing by from other places?</p>
<p>Or were there truly survivors here?  Ones that might’ve done the solemn deed?</p>
<p>If so, then there was hope, however faint.</p>
<p>“Mia,” I called.  “Your sister was a well-lent hand at the orphanage, wasn’t she?  And it was there where she last went—know you the way?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;yes…”</p>
<p>Her answer, verging on vanishing into the zephyrs.  I followed Mia as she went her guiding way, a winding trek during which, too, we found no bodies.  A relief, then, that she did not have to meet a cold, acquainted face—not yet, at least.</p>
<p>But my suspicions gained the colour of confidence as we continued on: someone truly had buried them all.  Indeed, the contrary seemed the inconceivable course.  There yet breathed, then, some surviving soul within these ruins.</p>
<p>This, I dearly hoped.</p>
<p>Fates be fair, let it be so.</p>
<p>At the end of the wishful walk did we arrive at the orphanage.  I looked up and all along its oaken countenance, finding its air oddly austere and reticent.  It was, in a word, sacrosanct, and of an architecture wholly untouched by Londosian aesthetics.</p>
<p>We stopped at the entryway, and glancing upon one another, nodded.  Carefully, I cracked the doors open, and calming my nerves with a deep breath, ventured in.</p>
<p>My heart raced.</p>
<p>Eva…  Is she truly alive?</p>
<p>Entering deeper, I peered all about.  But try as they might, my eyes found not a hint of activity, save for sunbeams brimming in from the mauled and misshapen windows, casting bright bands through the ambient dust.</p>
<p>“&#8230;”</p>
<p>Mia tiptoed in tow without a word, tugging at my sleeve as she went.  Upon her visage was a veil of quiet despair and defeat, her own eyes just as lost as mine at the stillness of this space.</p>
<p>Another look, then.  With frayed focus, I scanned about.</p>
<p>Ore-pine posts stood in succession, great in girth, almost pillar-like, and wooden, as though they were once trees-trunks themselves, bare of their bark and planed with all care.  Stairways, too, slanted up from the ground and into the overlooking lofts.  And upon the walls, there hung tapestries, delicate in their weave and intricate in their design.</p>
<p>These features, all, composed a pall of piety to some higher power, holding in them past purposes for rituals and worship.</p>
<p>“Mia, this place…  It looks more a fane than an orphanage,” I observed aloud.  “What is it, really?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;it was a shrine… they told me once…” she answered.  “&#8230;but other than that… I…”</p>
<p>A shrine?</p>
<p>The puzzle pieces fit squarely, then.  Most realms of Man hold themselves to be herds of lamb for Yoná, their one and only shepherd, as it were.  But the Nafílim walk by a different creed, for they follow not any one deity: theirs is instead a belief that in each and every thing, living or no, there dwells an essential <i>vættr.</i></p>
<p>I’ve heard before that where we Men have churches and cathedrals, the Nafílim have shrines and temples, within which dedications are made and these vættir are venerated.  This place well-fit the bill.  Little wonder, then, why I sensed sacredness within it.</p>
<p>Then, my skin was roused.</p>
<p>Goosebumps all around; sweat beaded upon my nape.</p>
<p>In the spheres of Man, it is not rare that orphans and oblates are brought into the care of a convent.  A cultural commonality with the Nafílim, then, from the look of this establishment.  And it is within shrines such as this that subterranes are often constructed below for the storage of ritualistic implements, as well as the brewing of myriad liquors.</p>
<p>Knowledge that is naught more than trivia to the churlish minds of the Fiefguard.  Indeed, I cannot imagine that any amongst those men would deign to bother with studying the folkways of their foes.  And so would the marauders five months past have been oblivious to what might lie beneath our feet at this moment.</p>
<p>That meant but one thing: survivors, sheltering out of sight.</p>
<p>And perhaps within their number—Eva herself.</p>
<p>Or perhaps… I presume overmuch.</p>
<p>Truly now.</p>
<p>Could there really be survivors here?</p>
<p>Yet alive after all this time?</p>
<p>I snapped back to the moment, finding my breaths thin and hurried.  But my feet were already on the move; if memory serves, entryways to foresaid basements are often built behind the main altar.</p>
<p>My cautious steps sounded through the shrine, its spaces no smaller than a church’s.  At its furthest reaches was the seeming altar itself, stark and stolen of all that Men might’ve espied any value.  To it I went, then wound about to its dusty posterior.</p>
<p>There, I squinted at the floorboards, finding a faint outline etched into them.  A hatch, no doubt, square in shape and quickly discernible only to eyes keen on its discovery.</p>
<p>Kneeling, I went to work opening it up.  With care, it cracked and lifted open.  Just as I thought.  And further confirming my suspicion: an unveiled set of stone stairs leading down.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;ah…”</i></p>
<p>A surprise for Mia, too, as she watched on from behind.  It would seem the Fiefguardsmen weren’t alone in their unfamiliarity with this feature.</p>
<p>“Wait here, Mia,” I whispered.  “I’ll have a look.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;y… yes, Master…”</p>
<p>With Mia staying put, I descended the stairs, finding the flight quite deep: thirty steps and more had me reaching the bottom.  The hollow was dim, lit only by the shaft of light from the entrance above.  But soft echoes were enough to betray the breadth of the basement space, its generosity earning my astonishment.</p>
<p>Spanning further in was a corridor, fifteen passūs forward, thereabouts, with numerous rooms sighing from both sides.  And at the end: a ponderous double-doorway, before which I soon found myself standing.</p>
<p>Hands upon the doors, I pushed.  Slowly, they creaked open.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;Aah…!”</i></p>
<p>Relief.</p>
<p>Rapture.</p>
<p>A mirthful mix of the two was expelled from my lungs, leaving my lips in a silly yelp.</p>
<p>Before me, a cellar of sorts, large and lambent with wick-light.  And in the softly glowing space: numerous Nafílim.</p>
<p>Almost a score of them; all children, save for two.</p>
<p>And they were alive…</p>
<p>By the fates, they were alive!</p>
<p>The moment left me numb of words.  I but stood and stood, stunned by the discovery.</p>
<p>Then, to my dumbfounded figure, a Nafíl.</p>
<p>An adult, one of two, hasting forth—a spear, firmly in hand.</p>
<p>Hostility, clear as day as it was a damper upon my elation.  I was careless; the price was paid with a spearhead piercing where my heart once was.  Having backed off into the corridor, I raised my hands forth.</p>
<p>“Wait!  I—”</p>
<p><i>“Eaaah!!!”</i></p>
<p>The Nafíl: a young woman.  Desperation twisted her face as her spear itself twisted to me once more.  A motion of utmost abandon.</p>
<p><i>“Uaaaaah!!”</i></p>
<p><i>“Ach…!”</i></p>
<p>Her spearmanship was unsharpened.  Yet in spite of its dulled delivery, the Nafíl heaved the weapon with the whole of her soul, instilling her very life into its iron tip.</p>
<p>Indeed.  She well-intended to die if it meant I went along with her.</p>
<p>“Stop!  Pleas—”</p>
<p>“You’ll not take us!” she screamed.  “Not one more!  Not anymore!  Not…!!”</p>
<p>She fast followed me into the corridor, wielding the spear in unwieldy ways.  But awash in her eyes was both a wrath ready to sear away aught and all, and as well, a sorrow set on chilling everything through and through.</p>
<p>Far behind her were the affrighted children, trembling in their shared embrace.  And to protect them, one and all, she was ready to face purgatory itself.</p>
<p>Thus, did she face me with all readiness.</p>
<p>“Please!  Hear me out!” I pleaded.</p>
<p>“You killed us!  You kidnapped us!  But no more!!”</p>
<p>A wuthering wail from her lungs as she lunged forth with her spear.</p>
<p><i>“Egh!”</i></p>
<p>A glancing wound across my shoulder.  A blow that should never have landed, dealt by a spear gripped in unhoned hands.  But I couldn’t keep up.  The girl Nafíl was giving her all, offering her life as tinder to a flame she well-wielded.  And there was I, harrowed by its unseen heat.</p>
<p>“My dear ones I’ll protect!  From <i>you!</i>  From <i>all of you!”</i></p>
<p>She was no warrior.</p>
<p>Nor was there a wisp of odyl imparted into the spearpoint—odyl with which all Nafílim are born.  Were she wise to the odyllic arts, I would’ve long been blown back, clear through the corridor.  Yet it was the truth that of those I’ve faced in battle thus far, she stood above them all.</p>
<p>And before I knew it, I was pressed against the wall, not far from the foot of the stairs.</p>
<p>“I will…!  <i>I must!!”</i></p>
<p>Her soul was set.  At me, she stared.  Truly, a soldier of abandon.</p>
<p>But I could not fight back.</p>
<p>I could not kill her.</p>
<p>Staring back at her, I knew it then.</p>
<p>Hers…</p>
<p>“Wait!  Listen!”</p>
<p>…were eyes of amber.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Eva!”</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;Hh…!?”</i></p>
<p>My whole-lunged call lingered through the dim.  My assailant stood, stilled of all forward movement, her body shaken by my words.</p>
<p>“H… how…?”</p>
<p>I answered with only a longer look back.  The light-shaft above shone down upon her desperate mien.  Behind the strands of hair dishevelled in the vehemence, her eyes were indeed bright with amber.</p>

<p>“How?  Why…!?  My name… why do you know…!?”</p>

<p>At last.</p>
<p>At long last.</p>
<p>For Mia, happiness.  At long last.</p>
<p>My efforts were not vain.  Finally could I return Mia to someone who yet yearned for her.</p>

<p>Thank you, Eva.</p>
<p>For being alive.</p>
<p>For never giving up.</p>
<p>For being our hope.</p>

<p>“Mia told me,” I revealed.  “She’s here.  With me.  We’ve been searching for you.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Wha…?” Her amber eyes widened.  “&#8230;What is this you… speak…?”</p>
<p>The spear rattled.  A weapon weeping.  Its wielder’s hands, quaking and quivering.  I turned to the flight of stairs and raised my voice.</p>
<p>“Mia!  Come!”</p>
<p>Then, a pitter-patter.</p>
<p>Timid footfalls from above, making their way down.</p>
<p>Mia looked at me along the way, eyes locked till she alighted at the bottom.  Only then did she turn to the corridor.  Only then, did she find the figure standing there, transfixed.</p>
<p>Amber eyes met.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;ah…”</i></p>
<p>A quiet gasp from Mia’s lips.  But with it, a welling of tears.</p>
<p>Ones shared with her sister.</p>
<p>“M… Mi… a…?” trembled the sibling voice.  “Mia…?  Is that you…?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Sis… ter…”</p>
<p>The spear fell.</p>
<p>The sister flew forth.</p>
<p>A flight taken, too, by Mia.</p>
<p>Then were sisters reunited, locking in an embrace.</p>
<p>A torn weave, now rejoined of threads.</p>
<p>“Mia!  Oh, Mia!”</p>
<p>“Eva!  Sister…!  Siste—r!”</p>
<p>A dim basement, brightened by their cries.</p>
<p>“Mia—!!”</p>
<p><i>“uaaah!!</i>  E… va…!  Sister…!  <i>waaaah!!”</i></p>
<p>Together, they wept and wailed.</p>
<p>Together, they shed their shared tears, one after another.</p>
<p>Together in arms, an unending embrace many moons in the making.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>Night fell.</p>
<p>Well within the cellar were we all sat together: myself, Eva, and another Nafíl, a woman unhurried in mien and manner, and long in her years.  The start of our quiet conversation carried through the cavernous space as the children, nigh score in number, slumbered away a ways off, sound in their assorted blankets.</p>
<p>Joining their dream-filled susurrations was Mia, cradled in her sister’s arms.  The hours of weeping and familial consolation have left the little girl all but spent, and what left her lips now were little besides the sighs of sleep.</p>
<p>“I must say again.  Through long courses have you come, son of Man.  Your toils, we thank you for,” the elderly Nafíl spoke.  “I am Irma, matron of this orphanage.  And Eva here, you have made acquaintance with, I am sure.”</p>
<p>“Well met, Matron.  It is an honour,” I bowed.  “I am—”</p>
<p>“We have no ears for Mennish names.”</p>
<p>A sword-cut of an interjection from Eva, earning a mild chiding from this “Irma”.</p>
<p>“Come now, gentle Eva.  Have warmth for him.  Through wooded ways has he wended, all to bring little Mia back to our embrace.”</p>
<p>“I…” Eva began to rebut, before looking down to her long-lost sister.  “For that, I thank him.  But…”</p>
<p>“It’s quite all right,” I brushed off.  “Your feelings are fair enough.”</p>
<p>“Fair” and more.  No red carpets would be rolled out for a kin of Man like me—not after what’d befallen upon this place.  That they gave me a chance to chat at all was well-worth a thousand of my own thanks.</p>
<p>“More importantly, this orphanage…” I broached anew.  “The both of you have kept the children safe all this time?  Here, underground?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;We have.  What remained here in the village has sustained us,” answered Eva.  “Though not for much longer…”</p>
<p>“To yonder, we make ventures for water.  But not too far.  And not too often,” Irma added.  “For wary are we of another coming of the War-Men.”</p>
<p>My thoughts turned to the surface—and what its spans lacked.  “And yet, the remains of the other villagers.  It was you both who buried them, no?”</p>
<p>“Yes.  We mourned them with fire-rites, as is our custom,” Irma sighed.  “A trying trial of many days, of course, but ours was a humble village, and I had my magicks to help…”</p>
<p>“Our dear ones were defiled…  What choice had we…?”</p>
<p>The voices of the two were awash with sorrow.  I could imagine why.  But what had bellowed in their bosoms, when they re-emerged into their devastated village and wandered its beloved yet broken spans, was beyond my knowing.</p>
<p>To say nothing of what they must’ve felt when, with fire, they bade farewell to their fallen family and friends.</p>
<p>“&#8230;My condolences are of little solace, Man that I am.  But…  I am sorry.  Truly,” I said solemnly.  “Eva, as well.  What befell your family, it… I…”</p>
<p>“I have heard… from Mia,” said Eva.  “&#8230;Poor Hanna…”</p>
<p>A quiver was in her quieted voice.</p>
<p>“Hanna”—the middle sister amongst Mia’s siblings.  To Eva, another younger sister, just as cherished, and now, all the more missed.  For it was this Hanna that Mia was captured with, and the one the fates saw fit to hand a dark end in Arbel’s concentration camp.</p>
<p>“Mother…  Father…  Brother…  I found them.  But not Hanna and not Mia.  Not them, yet… Yet, by then, I had no more hope…”</p>
<p>A recollection, brokenly recounted by Eva.  What a mountain of will this young woman had in her, to lose everyone and everything dear—and in spite of it, find the strength to give care and succour to all the children here in this room.</p>
<p>“Were my sisters even alive, no warmth would welcome them where they went.  Only cold cages, far, far away.  Forever far from where I wait for them,” Eva went on.  “So… it is a miracle now.  To have Mia here in my arms…  Like a dream, it is…”</p>
<p>“Son of Man.  Know you the weight of your plight?  From Mennish halls have you spirited away a slave, to where but the fields of your foe.  A deed undone even in our oldest myths,” Irma spoke of me.  “Might my ears hear of your will?”</p>
<p>I opened my palms, looking at them in a brief pause.  “&#8230;I wear the commander’s coat for the kingdom.  This tragedy has transpired under my charge, my watch.  I fear these hands are stained with the blood spilt here.”</p>
<p>“And forced your bloodied hand, that fear has?  To fare through the wood, all to return a foe-child to her family?  Or…?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Think you this washes clean those hands?  The saving of my sister?”</p>
<p>“That, I don’t know.  Perhaps you have the right of it.  Perhaps I play at valour too vain.  Perhaps this stain is too heavy a sin upon my soul,” I said, pained.  “Be that as it may, I believed Mia deserved to know.  A deed to be done, must be.  And so I obliged.”</p>
<p>“Son of Man.  You have heeded your heart.”</p>
<p>“Heeded… my heart?” I thought aloud, looking to Irma.  “I should like to think so…  Yet my heart is ever lost.  I feel myself a fool to heed it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, child.  Before me sits no fool,” the elderly Nafíl smiled.  “Son of Man.  You are <i>most gallant.”</i></p>
<p>Irma’s eyes were as gems of gentleness in her vouching of me.  I knew then of the immeasurable depth of her own heart, and of the sea of magnanimity that filled it.</p>
<p>Can such charity be found upon my face, too, were I in her place?</p>
<p>“Irma, wise Matron,” said I.  “You hold no hatred for me?  A Man?”</p>
<p>“Hatred?” Irma blinked.  “What hatred for the hero of little Mia?  I have said: not before has this deed been done.  A slave, returned.  Two sisters, together again.  For this, I know no hatred.  Only happiness.”  The matron then turned.  “Gentle Eva here has the same heart.”</p>
<p>Mia’s sister gave a strained mien.  “&#8230;I…  I hate not Man and his kin.  I make bigotry, were I to judge by his blood and not what beats in his bosom.  This, I know.  I know, yet…”  She looked away, and embraced Mia all the more tightly.  “&#8230;I need time.  To think.  To forgive.”</p>
<p>“Time…”</p>
<p>I was shaken then, as if struck with the feeling of defeat.</p>
<p>Eva…</p>
<p>It was her wish to forgive me, however painful it might prove.  It was her will to feign not the folly that was unfounded hatred for all of Man.  A far cry from his own creed, that so sees virtue in villainising and eviscerating Eva’s kind: the Nafílim, our so-called “nemeses”.</p>
<p>“The both of you,” I spoke again at last, “what will you do from here on?”</p>
<p>“Our stores empty more by the day; to Hensen we look,” Irma explained.  “But too long and lorn is the way, I fear.  Not one horse we have, and to make journey with many children in tow is a danger.”</p>
<p>By my estimation, it would take a day of haste upon horseback to reach Hensen from here.  Not too terrible a distance, but to escort a veritable crowd of children through the open fields would no doubt prolong the trek to their peril.</p>
<p>A danger indeed, lightly put.</p>
<p>“To the braves of Hensen I yearn to bring word of the War-Men’s whetted blades, but… beside the little ones must we remain…” Irma added.</p>
<p>My brows rose.  “Hold there.  The Fiefguard marches for Hensen?  How are you certain?”</p>
<p>“These ears remember well,” the matron began to recount.  “‘Next is Hensen’; so spoke the mouth of a Mennish chief.  This, I have heard from the shadows whence I hid as the village was invaded.”</p>
<p>Plausible.  Gravely so.</p>
<p>Just as this village stood beyond the northwestern mere of the forest, so, too, did Hensen at the northeast.  It had heretofore proven too bristling a Nafílim bastion for the tastes of the Fiefguard, and so was the latter loath to set foot in the fólkheimr.</p>
<p>But that has changed.  The balance of power here was shifted of late; mighty was the momentum now found in the lunge of Londosius’ lions of war, for the Nafilim numbers were well-withered.  It betrays no reason, then, to believe that the Fiefguard would next train its myriad swords upon Hensen, the very seat of the <i>jarl.</i></p>
<p>A tide of blades I can prove no protection against, even as commandant of Balasthea.</p>
<p>The tragedy of Mia’s village now threatened to reprise its thunderous throes upon Hensen itself.  The sole solace being that the fólkheimr had the manpower to mount a resistance.</p>
<p>Nay…</p>
<p>For as long as Balasthea, the bulwark of Ström, yet stood, for as long as the Fiefguard, the very <i>fangs</i> of Ström, yet drew breath, there was scant solace to be had in the hearts of the Nafílim here.</p>
<p>A pressing upon my own heart, then, to realise this.  And in doing so, I looked to Mia’s slumbering visage, a sight that brought to mind another matter: the other half of our journey’s designs.</p>
<p>“Matron,” I began again after the long thought.  “You are versed in magicks, you said?”</p>
<p>“That I have said, yes.  Meagre though my prowess may be.”</p>
<p>“Might you incant ‘Dispellendō’?  Between Mia and I is a thrallspell—I wish to have it gone.”</p>
<p>“‘Dispellendō’?  Yes, that is simple enough.  Very well.  Your wish, I grant.”  With that, Irma raised both of her palms: one to me, the other to Mia.  “Hmm…  Yes.  This thrallspell I well-sense.  Then shall bonds bind no more.”</p>
<p>“At your will, Matron.”</p>
<p>Faintly did a glow next glimmer from the flats of Irma’s hands.  The odyl-lights then condensed and coursed their way into Mia and me.</p>
<p><strong>“Dispellendō.”</strong></p>
<p>In my ears: a peal, much like the links of a chain sundered asudden.</p>
<p>“The manacle is unmade,” Irma confirmed.  “Freedom now, for you and Mia both.”</p>
<p>“Good Matron,” I bowed, “you have my deepest gratitude.”</p>
<p>For her part, Mia slept on with nary a disturbance in her peace.  Yes… peace, indeed.  At long last, a peaceful end to her lot as a slave.</p>
<p>“The laws of my land forbid the breaking of thrallspells, you see,” I explained.  “Had I not found a wiċċe like you here, it was my intent to take Mia with me to Hensen, and there try our luck.”</p>
<p>“You intended well,” nodded Irma.</p>
<p>“But having spoken with you both, it’s clear to me now: Hensen is where I must go, no matter the circumstance.”</p>
<p>“It is your will to warn the jarl, or…?”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>
<p>The matron’s mien wrinkled with trouble.  “You are sure of this?  Of another attack by the Mennish host, I have spoken, yes.  But five moons it has been, and nothing.  The possibility yet looms, of course, but Hensen watches and listens with many eyes and ears.  Its braves might be wise to it, I think.”</p>
<p>“They watch and listen, but have they moved?” I doubted.  “My men also watch the woods, and of late, they’ve espied little.  I cannot think, then, that the lions of Hensen have evacuated their citizenry.  They must know the full peril of their plight, and I’m the only free hand here.”</p>
<p>To the children I looked, and then to the sisters.</p>
<p>“I must go, if only to spare even one child from the same tragedy as Mia’s.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Why is it you do this?  Turn to Hensen, and you turn against your king,” Eva warned.  “A just act it is in our eyes, yes, but in those of Men, it is the doings of a traitor.”</p>
<p>“Let them look.  I know something of their scorn,” I said, sternly then, and softly next.  “Besides, you, Mia—your whole family went there once a year, yes?  Mia’s told me.  To her, it’s a place of many memories, all precious.”</p>
<p>“And to me, no less precious.  But what of it?”</p>
<p>“The lemonade they make there is a treat, I hear.  One well-loved by your family.”</p>
<p>Brows furrowed.  “It is…!  …It <i>was…!</i>  So what of it!?”</p>
<p>“In other words, Eva…  I will heed my heart.”</p>
<p>Firm in those words, I rose to my feet.  Awe was in Irma’s face as she watched, but it faded fast into a smile, calm and knowing in its glow.</p>
<p>Mild hills and sky-bearing flats were what spanned between here and Hensen.  A lay-of-the-land gentle enough for journeys by carriage; with the moon hanging high and unhazed, I foresaw little trouble in galloping the whole way on horseback.</p>
<p>“You go now?  Without a word to little Mia…?” the matron asked.</p>
<p>“I’m no good with goodbyes,” I confessed.  “A word to her now will be a wound too deep for me.”</p>
<p>“Those words…” spoke Eva, “&#8230;to my ears, they sound a farewell bade to my sister.”</p>
<p>I paused.</p>
<p>“&#8230;We knew this moment might come, Mia and I.  It’s by your side where she belongs, Eva, should we find you alive and well.  And indeed, we have…” I explained.  “We are worlds apart.  She, an innocent child.  And I, a Man steeped in war.  Were I to keep her in tow for too long, the stain will be hers as well one day, and to our woe.  What Mia needs from here on is healing and happiness.  That, I leave to you.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;I see.”</p>
<p>And by then, I well-knew.</p>
<p>Mia’s was a mind most keen.  No veil could hope to hide the heart from those amber eyes of hers.  Mine especially, and so were we to share words now, I doubt my resolve could escape her ken.  A resolve to lay my life on the line for what’s to come: the safeguarding of innocent lives, and as well, Mia’s very future.</p>
<p>A promise made is a promise kept, after all.</p>
<p>But to see me as I set out to certain death would surely slash another scar upon her own heart.  No, Mia has had her fill of misery.  Thus did I choose to be on my way without a word.</p>
<p>She’ll be all right from here on.  Eva stands with her now.  A young woman, strong of will, with prudence aplenty and, more than anything, a whole-souled sisterly love for Mia.  This was my measure of her, gleaned from just this conversation.  A measure that has unmade a mountain of my worries.  I can go now, unburdened by its weight.</p>
<p>In the midst of these thoughts, I watched Mia sleep on peacefully in Eva’s arms.</p>
<p>Kneeling, I then caressed her head, to which she stirred most softly.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;mm…”</i></p>

<p>Thank you, Mia.</p>
<p>For saving me.</p>

<p>Gratitude given from the depths of my heart.</p>
<p>Steps taken as I began to set out.</p>
<p>“Son of Man.  May fair winds find you.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Be safe.”</p>
<p>Irma’s and Eva’s words, heard as I parted from their company and their home.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>It was the untarnished truth that Ebbe, vice-commandant of Balasthea Stronghold, harboured a smouldering hatred for his newly installed superior, the Acting Commandant Rolf Buckmann.</p>
<p>Ah, yes.  Rolf Buckmann, a pus-blister carbuncle of a man!  An ungainly ungraced, untempered of blade and untested in battle, Buckmann!  His is a company undeserving of aught warmer than wintry scorn!</p>
<p>To say nothing of his wits, dumb as they are to the dullness of his fangs.  Yet with finical and fiery tongue does he tattle out his orders to Ebbe and them—truly a spectacle of fierce and flagrant foolery!</p>
<p>That was the thundering thought of Ebbe, and why he so rejoiced when Rolf Buckmann bumbled off on some break out-of-the-blue.  This was the moment, then.  The fresh and fruiting opportunity.  A meanwhile where Ebbe would be in charge of the fort.  Indeed, in the absence of that absurd addle-pate did the vice-commandant intend to accomplish much and more.  Already were the cogs of his contriving wiles wound and ready to wheel.</p>
<p>Fast in these fancies, a froggy chuckle escaped his bony throat.  But the daydream lasted not long, for at the fort was come a most unexpected visitor.  It was past noontide on the same day of Rolf’s respite, when Ebbe, sat smugly in the commandant’s seat, received this guest.</p>
<p>“A pleasure—er…” he began, knowing not what to make of the occasion.  “&#8230;Brigadier, lady, eh—”</p>
<p>“Of the Sorcery Brigade,” the ruby-eyed visitor confirmed, before presenting some proof.  “Here.  My hatchment.”</p>
<p>A squint at the filigree crest.  “Ah…  From the 5th, are we…”</p>
<p>Ebbe’s brows bent from flabbergastment.</p>
<p>The 5th Order—what else but the very nest whence the wingless Rolf Buckmann was flung.</p>
<p>Balasthea’s prior commandant was put out to pasture for the time being, on account of a chronic malady.  So it was that a replacement was needed.  Ebbe had well-thought himself to be up to the task.  He was, after all, the vice-commandant, the second-in-command, the right hand of the fort’s frontman all this time.</p>
<p>But alas.  Upon the commandant’s seat was sat instead some transfer from the 5th.  The bloke’s title?  <i>Acting</i> commandant.  And “transfer” was a sweet kindness: the man was but an exiled good-for-naught.  Balasthea was, at the time, a fort much fraught, dealing with death on the daily.  Yet on the whim of silver-spoon bureaucrats were its dire defences left to the direction of this toothless and silver-tongued tumbleweed.</p>
<p>Oh, the despair.  The indignance.  Ebbe was lost, <i>livid.</i></p>
<p>He chalked it up to some scheme or squabble amongst the aristocracy, as was wont to happen in lordly Londosius.  That’s not to say that Ebbe himself was rebellious of the nobles.  No, he was very much a beneficiary, for the good graces of Margrave Ström were well-trained upon the vice-commandant.  As such, he savoured quite sweetly the favours of the nobility, but when the taste turned any bitterly, Ebbe was a babe quick to curse his benefactors behind their backs.</p>
<p>In any case, the bony man nurtured no good impression of the Order that so graced him with the ungraced fool.  An irony of the fates, then, that he would entertain on this day a dame from the selfsame knightly lot…</p>
<p>…one with a name swiftly grating at his good mood.</p>
<p>“Felicia Buckmann,” she bowed slightly.  “Dame Brigadier to the Sorcerers of the 5th Chivalric Order.”</p>
<p>“Curious,” Ebbe remarked.  “Tell me, miss, what’s the commandant t’you, eh?”</p>
<p>“A brother.”</p>
<p>The fleer upon his face.  “&#8230;Ah.  A doting sister, t’have come t’the keen edge o’ the kingdom for her beloved brother.”</p>
<p>Venomous was the vice-commandant’s viper-eyes upon the young woman.  The very fact she had aught to do with the rat-bastard Rolf Buckmann was reason enough to earn her no welcome in Ebbe’s company.</p>
<p>“I wish to speak with him.  Is he present?” this “Felicia” asked firmly.</p>
<p>Once in the past was her life saved by her brother, from what but the horns of a harrowing beast, bedevilling denizen of some death-marked minery.  It was then that she thought to think differently of him, to cast upon his profile the long-lost light of their warmer years.</p>
<p>How coldly the mistrals came in its stead.</p>
<p>Argent arms and armour were soon bedecked upon the entirety of the Order’s ranks, a development that denied her brother any chance of victory in his spars.  All he knew from then on was defeat after defeat, and wet scorn spat upon his prostrate person.</p>
<p>A prodigy, her brother once was.  And so she knew his wits to be well-whetted.  Enough to devise some way to swim against the many tides turned against him, to make due even as he lacked the magicked luxury otherwise accorded to all kin of Man.</p>
<p>But he hadn’t.  Instead, he merely swung his sword about, set upon his ways against all prudence, only to be pounded into the ground by his peers.  A sight seen by Felicia’s eyes, time and again.  What foolishness, insanity even, to repeat futility and expect aught more than failure.</p>
<p>And of course, there was the hearing of months past, convened to deliberate his exile.  There did he reveal to her what a pig-pated and pouting child he had become, so obstinate in refusing both his faults and the saying of his sorries.  The performance earned naught but annoyance from his sister, by then long-dry of all adoration for him.</p>
<p>Still, Rolf was her brother.</p>
<p>And she, his little sister.</p>
<p>Never could she be soured so, that she would dare abandon him.</p>
<p>Hence her voyage of no few days: she had come to this fort to ask of him of the cold shoulder he had turned to Emilie’s call, and to discern whether he was so withered of wit to be unwise to the mareschal’s favour for him.</p>
<p>“Your dear brother’s on break, love,” Ebbe shrugged.  “A gadabout o’ an ungraced, off on vacation.  <i>Hoh!</i>  The ballocks o’ that bloke!”</p>
<p>Fain was the vice-commandant to unveil his enmity.  Insulting Felicia’s brother was too enticing upon his tongue to pass up, even if it meant earning the much-vaunted brigadier’s own enmity.</p>
<p>To his surprise, none of the sort was espied from his guest.</p>
<p>“On break?” Felicia said.  “A whole fort in his charge, and yet freely does he set aside duty for dalliance.  ‘Twould seem he’s still not risen to his office as a soldier, I see.”</p>
<p>“Oh?  That’s quite the slighting tongue for a sister, my dear miss,” Ebbe half-giggled.  “But who could blame you?  A brigadier sister; a banish’d brother.  Hah!  O, Yoná!  <i>Mercy!”</i></p>
<p>“Mercy for my nerves, if only,” she sighed.  “He’s dulled into a coistril of a cadet, that brother of mine.  ‘Twas my hope he would hone his blunted blade here, if even a little.”</p>
<p>A knock upon the door.  In then came a footman.</p>
<p>“Vice-Commandant,” he saluted.  “The margrave’s arrived.”</p>
<p>“Very well.”</p>
<p>Felicia blinked.  “The Lord Ström is come?  Here, at the fort?”</p>
<p>“That he is,” Ebbe beamed bonily.  “Follow, fairest Felicia.  If you mean t’meet him, I’ll show you the way.”</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>Balasthea’s embattled ramparts stood auburn against the sunset.  And outside its gates agape at the plains of Nafílim dominion, there was congregated a great army.  Ranks upon bristling ranks of soldiers, assembled and set for battle.  Billowing in the wind over them: the Fiefguard flag.</p>
<p>The Margrave Ström strolled afront his filed fighters before stopping beside Felicia.</p>
<p><i>“Well.</i>  A Brigadier of the Order, here in my humble homeland,” he began.  “And of the 5th, no less.  Fair lady, you are high-born, I take it?”</p>
<p>“I am.  From House Buckmann I hail.”</p>
<p>The margrave stared on.  <i>“Buckmann?”</i></p>
<p>“M’liege,” Ebbe spoke from anear.  “Our young miss shares blood with the ungraced—they be siblings.”</p>
<p>Lordly laughter boomed.  “How now!  What strength of arms this dainty damsel hides!  To have toiled in leashing her hound brother all these years!”</p>
<p>Toils, indeed.</p>
<p>But for such toils, and her own talents, the young brigadier brimmed with pride.  True, though, that it was scarcely seldom for Felicia to suffer the grating guffaws of others.  She was sister to an ungraced, after all: her brother’s stigma was too large a stain, for Felicia, too, came to share in some of the unholy shame.  The sneers and jeers reserved for Rolf, then, would often overflow in his sister’s direction.</p>
<p>But the margrave’s slight was not to be silenced.  And so did Felicia clench her teeth and ask him thusly.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency, you gather many men.  To what purpose, if I may ask?”</p>
<p>“Hm!  Need it be said?  They shall do what military men all do: march, and make battle.”</p>
<p>From here would the Fiefguard foray, was the margrave’s implication.  Fair enough; though Balasthea was not more than a minute’s walk away, they all well-stood upon Nafílim soil.  They: the militants of Man.  And therein lies the rub.</p>
<p>Not lightly should the military breath ever blow upon Nafílim fields.  For such a dear undertaking, prudence was paramount, to say nothing of planning and preparation.  Whether or not the myriad men were assembled after such considerations sparked much doubt from Felicia, for missing from the scene was a key and keen mind for command.</p>
<p>“Yet I’m told Balasthea’s acting commandant is absent,” she observed.  “Has he spoke aught on this matter?”</p>
<p>“I should sooner lend ear to pigs’ slaughter than the slithering words of that ungraced,” the margrave brushed off.  “This matter demands little heedance from him and his men.  They busy themselves with defence; <i>my</i> men mean to <i>attack.”</i></p>
<p>“Worry’d, fair Brigadier?” enquired Ebbe.  “Come, rest easy!  Valiant Ebbe joins the margrave’s men with his own!  Lo! the vaunted guardsmen o’ the Vice-Commandant, yours truly!”</p>
<p>Felicia swept her eyes to where Ebbe pointed.  Formed a ways off were files of silvered soldiers, thirty and more in number, mounted high on their horses.  The youngest amongst them returned a look of his own, lustful in its leer.</p>
<p>Paying him no mind, Felicia pressed on.</p>
<p>“Your Excellency.  The vice-commandant and his unit are themselves counted amongst Balasthea’s bulwark-men, are they not?  Their duty is defence, by your words; how are they made to march without their commandant’s consent?”</p>
<p><i>“I</i> give consent.”</p>
<p>Sharpness from the margrave.</p>
<p>To have amassed such multitudes of men, with many reams of gear and supplies in tow—the scale of this expedition certainly spoke of deals and decisions made well in advance.  Ebbe, too, was surely privy to the margrave’s designs, ones that called for the participation of the vice-commandant himself, along with his herd of elite grunts.  What gave it away was the easy eagerness in the bony man’s gait as he stood amidst the mighty enterprise.</p>
<p>Doubt clouded Felicia’s heart ever more.  Could it be that these men, prince and pawns alike, mean to move without a single word to her brother, commandant as he is of the very fort from which they would sally?</p>
<p>“But, Lord Ström…”</p>
<p>“My dear Brigadier.  Is it more than blood you share with that ungraced?  He well-gainsays the slaying of innocents—even should they be of <i>Nafílim</i> stock,” the margrave revealed, then emboldening his stare upon Felicia.  “Are his words <i>yours</i> as well?”</p>
<p>“That man has aired such ill…?” Felicia thought aloud.  “Nay, my Lord.  He and I are same of blood, but not of mind.  ‘Twas simply that I couldn’t espy why so many men should sally from his fort, on what occasion but his own absence.”</p>
<p>“Of minds, I pay none, to whether he curses us with his company or no,” the margrave remarked.  “But ‘tis certain he should raise a reeking stink were he here now.  So I say, all is well and good that our noses are spared of his stench.”</p>
<p>A grin then grew upon the lord’s lips, one caked with confidence and piety for his self-proclaimed justice.</p>
<p>“By the grace and godly name of Yoná shall my men at last march to Hensen, and there smite the unholy Nafílim hell-nest that it is.  And bring back to us much boon and bounty besides—slave-captives, and coffers each filled with coin and exotica,” the margrave announced at length.  “Be not worried, Brigadier.  Such riches shall enlarge the larders of Londosius.  This, I assure you.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;As you will, my Lord.”</p>
<p>None of the margrave’s words inflamed Felicia’s ears.  Right and just were his ambitions, a bedrock of surety for the longevity of Londosius.  Why, she even measured him to be rather proper to an extent: not often does a lord leave the comforts of his manor to personally see off his military men to their march.</p>
<p>It was but a spark of surprise that shook her from the moment.  Surprise for the deployment of Ebbe’s unit, fort-defenders though they were, as well as the endeavouring of an entire foray into Nafílim lands, on what day but the very day of Rolf’s absence.</p>
<p>Ah yes.  Rolf.  For her brother, Felicia knew only despair and disappointment, deeper now with his secret exclusion from this expedition.  A fine time to take leisure, whilst the world is on the move.  Despair, indeed.</p>
<p>“Right then, love.  We be off now,” Ebbe bowed passingly.  “A mite shame your brother has t’sit out this crusade.  Be a dear an’ console ‘im for us, will you?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Of course,” returned Felicia, ill-able to rebuke Ebbe’s rabblerousing.</p>
<p>Writ boldly now upon her agenda was this very matter, of which she meant to take up fully with her brother.  But such was only a footnote to the crux of her coming to this province of Ström: to press Rolf on why he let slip Emilie’s gracious hand.</p>
<p>This was the brigadier’s resolve.  To set herself upon her brother as he couches in his cowardice, and teach him of what path he ought take.  It was late, but not overly so.  Thus was Felicia resolute on returning to Arbel, all to pay a visit to Rolf’s residence.</p>
<p>Off to her side was the margrave, speaking anew with one of his commanders.</p>
<p>“It is time.  Hie now, and bring word of Hensen’s fall!  Yoná be with you!”</p>
<p>Saluting, the commander turned to the arrayed army, and raised high both sword and voice.</p>
<p>“Heed, men!  We go north past the woods!  And from there, turn to pierce Hensen whence rises the sun!  Hold fast your blades and steel well your souls!  For in this battle shall we strike the devils full-sore!  Back to the pits of hell whence they hail!  March!  March now!  Onward!  Onward!”</p>
<p><i>“Ooooouuhh!!”</i></p>
<p>“To victory!”</p>
<p>“Holy Grace be our Guide!”</p>
<p>The host of Men swelled with sound, thundering into the unblemished skies.  Then, under the watch of their margrave, they slowly commenced their march.  Thousands of earth-thudding steps, paving a path to Hensen, from the denizens of which these kin of Man would hew dominion over this land.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>I gunned the horse to a gallop, cutting through the moon-cold plains.  The night howled all around as I huddled low against the saddle: no Man would survive for long were he caught out in the open so.  That very reason found my face and form shrouded fast from outside sight, in not a hooded cloak, but a blanket.</p>
<p>Caution duly paid, though to little profit: it seemed this stretch of land northwest of the woods was wholly unmanned at this dark hour.  All the better; with my way free of waylayers, I kept my eastward course.  Night later blushed with dawn.  Up and up, the sun soared to its high-noon perch, whereupon I stopped atop a row of hills overlooking the lively sprawl of Hensen.</p>
<p>West afront the fólkheimr proper was a gate, guarded by two standing soldiers.</p>
<p>Right.  The hourglass waits not.</p>
<p>I cantered down the slope and to the vicinity of the entrance.  There, I dismounted before undraping myself of the blanket and unbuckling my sword.  Holding it up, I began my approach.</p>
<p><i>“&#8230;Mm!?”</i> grunted a squinting soldier as he roused to action.  “A Man!  A Man at the gates!”</p>
<p>“You there!” the other echoed.  “Not a step closer!”</p>
<p>Spears were speedily trained upon me, in spite of the surprise.  A honed reaction: these two were well-drilled.</p>
<p>“I am Rolf Buckmann!  Acting Commandant to the battlements of Balasthea!” I returned, tossing my sword to the ground.  “I am come craving admittance to your jarl!”</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p><i>“Humph.</i>  Balasthea’s commandant be broad of shoulders, my scouts say.  You match square their descriptions,” so spoke an enthroned Nafíl: the Jarl Alban.  No less than fifty winters have buffeted this lion of a leader—winters of war-waging, stitched together to a shroud shading his dread and giant frame.  “But your coming be a run that cuts against the flow.  Here you are—a commander naked of army, a Man alone from kinsmen.  What queerness has come before me?”</p>
<p>“Queerness, indeed,” I answered.  “That a jarl would grant so quick an audience to his foe—it affrights reason.”</p>
<p>Till now, much of my thoughts were racked by how I might meet this jarl, or at the very least, some like authority with an ear for the heavy matter to come.  That all it took was to present myself at Hensen’s doorstep baffled me well into this moment.</p>
<p>Where was I but the palatial <i>jarlshǫll</i> itself.  An edifice of oak, of but one level yet large upon the land where it laid.  And though its scope impressed, more so did its air: the timbers, the adornments, the design, all were thoroughly aged as a home to Hensen’s many former lions.</p>
<p>Into such a hallowed abode had I, a Man and foe both, been let through.  Not a single binding was set upon my body; an earnest check about my person well-sufficed to have me presentable before the jarl’s presence.</p>
<p>Easy enough, yet the air was stifled here in the wide atrium-yard.  Noonlight cascaded down from the open skylight and shone whitely upon my shoulders.  Watching on from the cincturing shade were the many furrowed eyes, figures solemnly filed and flanking my left and right: the seeming <i>húskarlar,</i> men and women, leaders in their own right, each of sworn service to their jarl.</p>
<p>It bears mentioning that, as my past readings suggest, the Nafílim are not a united people.  Indeed, rather than nest together in a single nation, they are dispersed in disparate clans in disparate lands, each headed by a jarl.  And it is a fact that though the folk of a clan <i>be of</i> a clan, they are not all bloodkin; what binds them instead is a free yet collective spirit, a community congregating under a common banner.  Beholden to them is the jarl, who earns his place upon the high-seat not by heirship, but by his deeds and deeds alone.</p>
<p>For Hensen’s part, as well as other settlements proximal to it, its denizens are of the Víly clan—the <i>Vílungen</i>—presided over by the Jarl Alban: the very same soul before me, whose eyes stabbed with their stare.</p>
<p>“Audience? Yes, there is audience,” he retorted, then turning his gaze to the forgathered húskarlar.  “Them, I let see your face before your head I hew: the fate of a commandant corner’d in the home of his foe.”  Back at me, the jarl looked.  “You are come on a sotted whim?  Or have you in your heart some death-wish?  <i>That,</i> I shall grant you, bastard of Man.”</p>
<p>His voice, deep like an earthquake and well-matched to his mountainous mien and muscle.  But in that same voice ran veins of vehemence for Men and the jarl’s readiness to erupt from his seat and smite them with any blade at hand.</p>
<p>“He the one, Sire?” asked a húskarl amongst the file.  “Not some mummer sent to our midst?  Nor some scheme of Mennish minds?”</p>
<p>Doubt was thick in his words.  Justified, I admit.  After all, even a dream of mighty imagination could scarce paint a commander traipsing alone into the maw of his foe.  Not least in a war like this, with both sides so viciously at each other’s throats.</p>
<p>“Those Mennish minds know much vict’ry of late.  Such schemes are now a savour long-surfeited on their tongues; they ill-indulge a ruse on us, I think.  Our jarl spoke true.  Onyx eyes and soot-black hair: this Man looks as reported.  And his body besides—lo! strong it is, a stoutness rare even amongst Men.  He is who he says, I say.”</p>
<p>“Oh?  Then I say, quite courageous, this commandant!  He is but one, yet quivers not!”</p>
<p>Remarks from two húskarlar standing right beside the jarl.  They evidently numbered amongst the top echelons—”war-chiefs”, as it were, direct commanders to the martial cohorts of Hensen.</p>
<p>The first was Volker, calm and composed in his calculation of this unprecedented occasion.  Little more than thirty in his years, there was a dour glint of intellect in his gaze, whilst his figure was slender of frame, though not from frailty, no: I espied in this Volker not just the the sharpness of a strategist, but the strength of a seasoned swordsman.</p>
<p>The other was Berta, a woman of frankness and forty years of age, thereabouts.  Her figure seemed the complete contrary to Volker’s, replete as it was with rotundness as it swayed with her every gesture.  And crowning it was a countenance of both gentleness and bravado, beaming with the smile of a long-lived mother.</p>
<p>“Courageous—and keen, and <i>cunning</i> besides,” Volker went on.  “Sire.  Never were Balasthea’s blades more whetted and walls more unwavering till this commandant took to the war-table.  My measure of him: <i>anathema,</i> he is.  To our plight, to our people.”</p>
<p>A most cutting commentary, if not complimentary.  The keenness in Volker’s stare, too, was no less unwavering in the course of his words.</p>
<p>“I’m but an <i>acting</i> commandant, you should know,” I corrected.</p>
<p>“So you say, yet our eyes see you no friendlier a foe for it.  A foe to be <i>fell’d.”</i></p>
<p>“The war-chief well-convinces, Sire.  Uproot the sprout, and we spare ourselves the willow of wandreth.”</p>
<p>The other húskarlar steamed with assent.  In the prongs of their hearts were set the red jewels of ire for Men and their ilk; the grim glimmer shone unsullied through their eyes.</p>
<p>“Come, rest your brows, all.  Our ‘foe’ here has something for our ears, from the look of him.  Let us lend, yes?” soothed Berta.  The scene all but affirmed the roles of these two war-chiefs for their jarl.</p>
<p>Hearing their words, a nodding Alban broke his silence.  “So be it.  Speak, foe-guest.”</p>
<p>To him, I looked.  “First things first: some of your far-off folk need aid,” I broached.  “Two women, sixteen children; survivors of an attack on their village five months past, northwest beyond the bourne of the woods.  They hide in cellars beneath an orphanage.  Hide—and wait for succour.  Will you not go and give it to them?”</p>
<p>A silent instant, and the húskarlar were then aroar, their rancour resounding all throughout the atrium.</p>
<p>“These things he speaks—how can he know!?”</p>
<p>“A folly!  A foul trap!”</p>
<p>“Our lands you breach’d, our people you pillaged!  Now you mean to parley!?”</p>
<p>“A massacre wrought by the mammon of you Men!  There is no doubt!”</p>
<p>That last line—likely the clarion most clearly revealing their sore sentiments.  Some amongst the húskarlar clenched their teeth, others their fists to raw and quaking tautness.  Though it was their eyes that shared a stinging stare upon my person.</p>
<p>Amidst their mad thundering, the jarl rose from his high-seat.  Quiet returned.  The air stilled.  His steps stamped their way to me before large fingers lunged forth and seized my collars.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Your ears have heard our woe,” Alban began.  “Your hands have stolen our treasures.  Your swords have <i>hewn</i> our folk.  Now, what says that mouth of yours?”</p>
<p>Arms, boulder-like in all their burliness, set every sinew to wringing and raising my collars.  Strength of much awe, and wrath no less awful.  But I could not afford to falter before such power; unflinching, I fastened my sight to his.</p>
<p>“This, it says: I’ll not apologise for aught we Men have sown in battle.”</p>
<p>Lids flared.  “There is <i>fire</i> on your tongue.  A <i>Man-foe</i> for true…!”</p>
<p>Pouring into his grip was grim power greater still.  Veins swelled along his massive arms, boughs bulging with the anger of the earth.  Upon them I laid my own hands, and next exerted a defiant grip of my own.  The jarl’s voice seethed.</p>
<p>“&#8230;And a <i>fool</i> besides!”</p>
<p>Furrows flashed across his face.</p>
<p>I came here neither to gloat of my own strength of arms, nor to submit to the might and misery of these proud people.  No, the jarl must know that I be a soul with words worthy of his ears.  Thus did I sink my fingers further into the flesh of his forearms.</p>
<p><i>“Mgh…!”</i></p>
<p>“The fire upon my tongue is but a wick-light to the world-flames of war,” I said back.  “Without aim nor ailment have they burned <i>both</i> sides.  But not by steeping ourselves in hate shall they be quenched.”</p>
<p>The jarl narrowed his eyes.  “Think you the wiseman?  That the spittle of your speech might drown what flooding centuries of war could not quench?  Speak!  O, <i>wiseman!”</i></p>
<p>“I am no wiseman.  Nor has there ever been, who so plies his wisdom to the withering of this war.  For it rages more than ever, and his absence aches us all.”</p>
<p>“Ache indeed, mine ears!  From the hollow wiles of the wiseacre before me!” came Alban’s volcanic voice.  “The ‘wisdom’ of your fellows and forebears sees rightness in the sightless slayings of our innocents!  Yet hastily from their blood-halls are you come to our pillaged place!  Our pain’d presence!  To what!?  Wallow in our wounds with your salted words!?”</p>
<p>Pained, indeed, the jarl’s own words, if not palpably wroth.  A pain wrought by the reasonless slaughter set upon the more peaceable amongst his people.  Friends and family all, meek and now vainly lost.</p>
<p>A war-wheel turning with the momentum of centuries—more losses alike, then, were sure to follow.  The resentment born from such a realisation was, in fact, a wound upon the leader of these lost people.  How deeply it ran forever escaped my ken.</p>
<p>My hands relaxed and released, moved by the thought.</p>
<p>“Again, I’ve no apologies for what’s transpired in battle,” I reiterated, looking away not once.  “But putting innocents to the sword—<i>that</i> is not battle.  Not at all.  For such tragedies do I apologise to you, one and all.  Truly.”</p>
<p>My words earned a silence from Alban as he elected to, with all slowness, free me from his own grip.  Yet his anger gained no softness in the while, and that stare of his was as solid and searching as ever.</p>
<p>“Overlate—<i>vain</i>—be your apology, Man-foe,” the jarl spoke again.  “Think you our slain babes and elders make return to us?  With just that apology of yours?”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Would that my words were empowered so.  How freed would we be, to reunite with all we’ve lost.  But I’ve no such power.  None amongst us do.  Those who’ve left us behind—they can never turn back.  The pain echoes through you all, just as it does through me.”</p>
<p>I knew.  All too well.  To them, my apology was but a meaningless remedy.  But against all reason do the forlorn yet yearn only for the return of their dearly departed.  This, too, I knew.</p>
<p>Though the enmity in their eyes was unwaning, there was then a concrete quietude in all the húskarlar around me.  The Jarl Alban unfurled his fist before yielding a long breath from his lips.</p>
<p>“&#8230;You do not sound the mouthpiece of Man’s mind.”</p>
<p>“Indeed.  These are my thoughts, and mine alone.”</p>
<p>Once more did the veins vault upon the faces of Alban and his vassals.  Anger again, but now bedight with bewilderment at my unveiled will.  Man only ever saw his Nafílim neighbour as a nemesis to be massacred unto nothingness.  And so for these same Nafílim to hear an apology from the lips of one such Man was surely a shock to their wits.</p>
<p>Alban gave greater weight to his glare, as if to seek out the truth in my soul.  Then, with an unmuddied timbre, he asked anew.</p>
<p>“The ravaging of our kind kindles revelry and release in the heart of Man.  Why does yours steer from this course?”</p>
<p>“Because it’s wise to what perhaps lies beneath the world: a machination unseen.”</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>“The world?  The machinations beneath?”</p>
<p>The jarl’s brows cocked.  An action surely shared by all the room.</p>
<p>Indeed, they heard right: a machination.  A device of deception.  A contrivance about which the world was coiled and controlled.  The unseen currents of an unseen maelstrom, which I’d sensed from winters before, only now given words for the very first time.</p>
<p>Alban shook his head slightly.  “Your words are as a warren.  Speak what you mean.”</p>
<p>“I’ve a tale that speaks of it aplenty,” I answered, “but one to be told another time; the village survivors wait and waste to this moment.  Pray lend them your aid, and soon.”</p>
<p>A heavy moment.  “&#8230;Below the orphanage, was it?”  The jarl nodded to one of his húskarlar, whereupon the latter summarily left the atrium.</p>
<p>“Your defences, as well: they must needs be bolstered,” I went on.  “Lest the survivors find your fólkheimr no less a ruin than their village.”</p>
<p>“You scry swords set on Hensen?”</p>
<p>“I do.”</p>
<p>The jarl squinted with slow relent.  Is this all really a ruse?  Or a rebellious spark from the flames of Man?  Whichever his conclusion, I then continued on revealing the veiled motivations of the margrave for Hensen, and in addition, my strategic counsel as a commandant: that the Fiefguard very well means to march on this fólkheimr.</p>
<p>None of the Nafílim muttered a single word as I gave them all of mine.  A sound surprise; I fully anticipated plugged ears for aught I had to say.  Certainly they were not paying their collective attention without due caution, but due more so was some propriety for the lone foe meandering into their midst, to tell them what he dared not in the company of his kin.  Such was the resolve that I gleaned from them as my words went on.</p>
<p>“&#8230;The Fiefguardsmen have you fixed in their sights.  All one hundred-score of them and more,” I concluded.</p>
<p>The húskarlar hummed uneasily.  There is much credence to the commandant’s counsel, they must’ve thought, but equal cause for concern, if so.  Two-thousand soldiers set on sacking Hensen was threatening enough—too much a threat for the fólkheimr’s present defences, most likely.</p>
<p>Fielding a large force against Hensen was heretofore a fraught stratagem, what with the woods in the way of an easy march.  All Londosius had endeavoured to this point were mere skirmishes.</p>
<p>It was my work as commandant that proved the vicissitude: Ström’s soldiery suffered less, whilst the local Nafílim all the more.  With dwindled numbers, Hensen could ill-afford to waylay the Fiefguard’s wooded march and field its own defences in the same stroke.  The margrave well-reaped what I’d sown, and I surmised he would soon amass as large a host as could cross the forest.</p>
<p>Hence my prediction of a force of at least two-thousand Fiefguardsmen, a number that weighed heavily on the húskarlar’s hearts.</p>
<p>“&#8230;A weapon, your words are, turned upon your own kingdom.  You mean to tread a treasonist?”</p>
<p>Lowly aired words from the jarl’s already low timbre.  From his barbed leer upon me, I yet sensed an ire for more foolery that might issue from my lips.</p>
<p>“Londosius is yet my homeland, ruesome and rotted though it may be.  I mean not to nock an arrow aflame against its spans, but just the same, I could not stay myself from warning you all of the reckoning to come.”</p>
<p>“What moved you?” he asked.</p>
<p>“Weariness.  What else but weariness?  The innocent and faultless, divested and sent to their deaths.  Families, taken and torn asunder.  These, I wish never to see again.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;’Again,’ you say.”  A hint of sorrow from Alban’s eyes as he nodded mutedly.  I saw then the severity of his mien thinning at last.  “The intelligence, I should thank you for.  But long-wary are we of an attack aimed at our walls.”</p>
<p>“Not wary enough, by my measure,” I was quick to point out.  “The Fiefguardsmen are unfit for battle in the forests.  They mean to sally straight northward from Balasthea, and once past the wood, wend eastward into Hensen.  You must meet them with a force of your own, stationed not amongst the trees, but out in the plains west of your walls.”</p>
<p>“Mm…”</p>
<p>“Indeed, had you soldiers enough, harrying the Fiefguard in their wooded march might’ve proven more profitable.  Yet ‘enough’ is neither what I see, nor what I’ve heard from my own reports.  A phalanx to bar their entry is your soundest option.”</p>
<p>“‘Enough’ my braves once were,” the jarl uttered, “till you sat at the war-table.”</p>
<p>“I sat there that Balasthea’s battlements might not break.  As I’ve said before, your braves who’ve met their end upon those walls earn no apology from me,” I reminded him.  “That aside, your citizenry must needs be evacuated; the west district residents firstly, to wit.  But they must be willing to part with their coin and treasures—the Fiefguardsmen lust for lucre, you see, and even a battle raging ‘round them ill-dulls their greed.  Let them tarry and rummage, I say.  It buys your forces time more precious again than what bait the Fiefguard might bite.”</p>
<p>“You strategise as keenly as you criticise, Man of the fort,” Alban remarked.  “&#8230;But to let your kinsmen maraud?  You must know, my people are meagre of means.  I do not see your way.  Did you not come to stall the pillaging?  Or?”</p>
<p>“It’s more an insurance, should the western defences crumble,” I assured the jarl.  “Were the Fiefguard to enter the fólkheimr, expect torches to be laid upon the houses.  But that’s fine enough.  Homes can be rebuilt, expenses can be paid for.  Snatch victory from the Fiefguard’s hands, and you just as well snatch back all they’ve stolen.  It’s your people that must be kept from harm; they are themselves treasures irreplaceable, after all.  Let them know of this, and surely they’ll follow your every word.”</p>
<p>Sacrifices were needed.</p>
<p>A woundful reality, evident so long as Hensen lacked soldiers enough to stay the Fiefguard’s tide.  So long as Hensen was, to the Nafílim here, a home to be protected no matter the price.</p>
<p>Of course, no stratagem would be suffered that so feeds the meek and innocent to the maws of war.  Thus did I table any tactic that, at most, sacrifices that which can be sown again.</p>
<p>My counsel continued.  Of the Fiefguard’s composition, its formations, its manoeuvres—aught I knew, the jarl and his húskarlar now knew, as well.  This much divulgence was flagrant treason, surely, but a crime gladly committed were it to save even a single citizen of this fólkheimr.</p>
<p>Still, sins are sins, and this one my shoulders bore no less heavily.  Though it were thoughts of Mia and those of like fate that convinced me of the weight’s worthiness.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>The jarlshǫll loomed behind as I left its ancient halls.  Adjourned was the audience with Alban; with the warning relayed, I began my way back to the west gates whence I first entered.</p>
<p>Noonlight was fast fading.  Already from the far horizon was the mirk of evening growing.</p>
<p>“I thought I’d spend the day chained and gaoled, truth be told,” I said.  “Fresh air seldom smelled so sweet.”</p>
<p>“As it should,” Volker remarked, walking beside me.  “Your safe return might sow the seed of peace between our peoples.  This, the jarl has surmised.”</p>
<p>“Peace, you say…”</p>
<p>A pensive murmur from my lips, punctuated by glances and stares upon my person from the surrounding populace.  In their myriad eyes were curiosity and caution.  Some were sallowed with fear.  A few glared with anger.</p>
<p>“Impossible, perhaps,” the war-chief went on.  “This, too, the jarl knows.  As do we.  But even a broken seed must be sown, for whether it sprouts, none can know for true.”</p>
<p>Would that Londosian soil were more nurturing of such a precious sprout.  But alas.  The kingly realm brims and billows with war-winds ever bent on the snuffing of the Nafílim flame.  That much I knew for certain.</p>
<p>How humbling, then, that it were the Nafílim themselves that could not completely spurn the seed of peace.</p>
<p>…Nay.</p>
<p>Perhaps theirs was the right heart to have.  It was, to begin with, baleful and bewildering to so wish for a wasting war, one that wants no end before whichever party first reaches its reckoning.</p>
<p>“Generous be our clan-sire; were his hands mine, you would die by them whence you stand,” Volker continued.  “Much good it do you to have thanks for him.”</p>
<p>“I’m plenty thankful, just as I am for leaving my sword at the gates.  You don’t seem the sort to slay a man unarmed, after all.  Not to my eyes, at least.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Hmph.”</p>
<p>The war-chief was as much a richly-witted man as I first measured him to be.  That’s to say, any arrow he lets loose, earnest or no, is an arrow that finds its mark, as it were.  Yet for however whetted his wits were, he was equally a warrior of unmistakable mettle.  Courtesy moved his compass—not by his blade would an unbladed soul be laid low.</p>
<p>“I’m right glad you all lent ear to my words, in any case,” I confessed.  “And with rather cooled veins, no less.”</p>
<p>“We are a people of principle.  We judge for what a heart beats, not what blood courses through it—even should it be the heart and blood of a Man.”</p>
<p>“The heart, is it…”</p>
<p>“Still, we know well of doubt and fear.  The same we have for you—and enmity besides, steeled by the hard-fought centuries between our forebears both.”</p>
<p>“That, I’ll not gainsay.”</p>
<p>The Jarl Alban.  His húskarlar withal.  It was cold decorum and discretion that craved the lending of their ears for the words of a Man.  And as well, whatever gleanable advantage that might avail them against the attack to come.</p>
<p>Yet Volker revealed the right of it—undercurrent to their calculated tolerance was enmity, to be sure.  A current pushed by past partings with their comrades-in-arms.  And it was certain: not few amongst the húskarlar have also lost family and loved ones in the waging of this war.</p>
<p>All things told, their judgement found my admittance just, even as their hearts howled with hate for the Man before them.  The staying of their readied blades was solely for whatever brighter days this strange occasion might herald—not on account of some fancied forgiveness for me or my kinsmen.</p>
<p>Hm…</p>
<p>My kinsmen…</p>

<p>How might I have carried myself, I wonder?  Were I saddled with the same sorrow, the same animosity as the húskarlar and their people?</p>
<p>And in light of their losses, what—and who—have I myself to lose?</p>
<p>Emilie, Felicia—they and others make for an unequal comparison.  After all, fighting is their livelihood.  War is their art.  Long have they made peace with their own mortality.</p>
<p>Nay…</p>
<p>Suppose I have for myself some dear and gentle soul, who waits beyond the bounds of the battlefield for my safe return.</p>
<p>Suppose further that she be deprived.  On a day like any other, deprived asudden of her dignity, of her very life.</p>
<p>What would become of me?</p>
<p>Of Rolf Buckmann, as he stands amidst the ruins of aught and all he once cherished?</p>

<p>“&#8230;I can scarce imagine.”</p>
<p>“Mm?  What is it you mumble, Man?”</p>
<p>“Ah—no, it’s nothing.”</p>

<p>Indeed.</p>
<p><i>‘I can scarce imagine.’</i></p>
<p>Such would be my only answer in this matter.</p>
<p>Those who know loss.  Those who know tragedy.  Whirling within the depths of their hearts is both resentment and rancour well beyond the imaginations of those who know not.</p>
<p>Thus do these sufferers suffer further.  Their pain begets pain.</p>
<p>And thus have I learnt never to feign shallow sympathy, for it be only salt upon their open wounds.  But staying the salting hand, recognising the pointlessness of pity—these are my sole recourse, and what poor recourse they are.</p>
<p>Silence be of little solace and succour.  What, then, can I do?</p>

<p>“Chief!”</p>
<p>A voice, tugging me from the thorns of thought.  Its master, a lad with lividness in his visage, veered to Volker, having just passed by the both of us in our westward walk.</p>
<p>“What’s this about?” he pressed Volker.  “Why does a Man walk within our walls!?”</p>
<p>The war-chief raised a palm.  “Calm, Kunz.  There is reason enough.”</p>
<p>“Calm?  <i>Calm!?</i>  He’s a Man, Chief!  A foe in our fólkheimr!” yelled this “Kunz”.  With blunt briskness did he then brush aside Volker and step straight to me.  His hands sprang forth, shoving me back.  <i>“&#8230;Murderer!</i>  Why are you come!?  Whose end seek you now!?”</p>
<p>I stood my ground, wordless.  Seeing my silence, Kunz came up once more to catch my collars.</p>
<p>“Speak, <i>enemy!”</i> he howled up at my face.  “You savour much of our blood!  How much more till you’re sated!?”</p>
<p>Even then, I kept quiet.</p>
<p>“Speak, I said!”</p>
<p><i>‘I came not to kill—not you, not your dear ones.  Not anyone.’</i></p>
<p>This, I could not give air.  Whether from knowing well they’d be words most unsought by Kunz, or from being left speechless in the face of his fury.  For there were tears running down the cheeks of this lad.  The eyes that shed them were as daggers piercing my bosom.</p>
<p>What pain.</p>
<p>What wrenching, piercing pain.</p>
<p>Ever was this so.  When met with the lament of those stricken by loss, their pain was as my own.  One that seemed to bore holes in my heart.</p>
<p>“Kunz.  Calmness.  Let him free,” Volker soothed the lad, laying a hand upon the latter’s shoulder and pulling him gently back.  Kunz relented and released me from his clutches, but not from his stabbing stare.  Volker spoke on.  “Explanations enough I have for you to hear.  But for now, go.  And give rest to your veins.”</p>
<p>The lad had little mind for heedance.  He glared on and on at me, tearfully frowning and furrowed to the fullest.</p>
<p>“Kunz.  You have heard me.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Yes.  Calmness,” Kunz broke his silence.  “I’ve wounded the winds.  Forgive me, good Chief.”</p>
<p>With that muttered, the lad left our presence, but not before giving me one last gouging glare.  I looked on at his awaying shoulders, spiritless as they were.</p>
<p>“&#8230;He’s lost someone, hasn’t he?” I observed.</p>
<p>“That he has.  A bride-to-be.  As one, their hearts were, from their greenest days,” Volker revealed, walking forth once more.  “The wedding was soon.”</p>
<p>A betrothed, torn from Kunz’s side.</p>
<p>Our lots, his and mine, could not be any more different.  Surely he could’ve given his bride-to-be a life most blissful—were she yet alive.</p>
<p>Still, we’re the same, he and I.  Surely so.  Sadness is in him, thus he sheds tears.  Anger burns him, thus he bellows and lays blame.</p>
<p>What are these but the same pains suffered by Men?</p>
<p>The very same.</p>
<p>In a Nafíl is life.  A will.  A heart.</p>
<p>What separates us, then?</p>
<p>Naught.</p>
<p>Kunz’s tears enlightened me anew to this truth.  He loves what is beautiful, and loves little what is otherwise.  Of this, I am certain.</p>
<p>Beyond a window, within billows of auburn leaves, a tree in its autumn dress.</p>
<p>Cackling and crackling in a hearth, a humming fire, bright and warm.</p>
<p>Freshly stretched and tanned, a span of well-made leather, uniquely fragrant.</p>
<p>After a day’s labour, a gulp of cold and crisp water for the parched throat.</p>
<p>These, too, he has love for.  As do I.  We are one and the same.  And yet, we can scarce live amongst one another.</p>
<p>Why?</p>
<p>On and on, I looked upon Kunz’s fading figure, whilst the unanswered questions only burgeoned in my bosom.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>“Hold.”</p>
<p>A word asudden from Volker after much walking since then.  I turned to find him halted, even as our destination laid yet a long ways off.</p>
<p>“From here to the gates, you walk—alone,” the war-chief went on.  “Trouble avoids you now, not as earlier.”</p>
<p>I cocked my head slightly.  “Alone?  Man that I am?”</p>
<p>“The folk there are fraught, blind to aught but their own suff’ring.  Your presence is little pain, for living is pain enough to them.”</p>
<p>I then gleaned a glint of gloom in Volker’s gaze.  He watched the weighty air falling upon the district in question, as though the place were a panging scar upon the sprawl of the fólkheimr.</p>
<p>“That share of Hensen we set aside for the direly destitute.  There, they may find succour.  Though, woundful to say, they find little of it,” he confessed.  “We Vílungen scant and scantle on, always with toes upon the cliff-edge to collapse.  Indeed our lot is meagre; there be where our frail fortunes lay themselves barest.”</p>
<p>“A sight the jarl bids me see, I take it?”</p>
<p>“You discern his design, Man.  Just as he does of something in you; something that gives him hope,” he said, then looking to me.  “Though truth be told, I share little of his sight.”</p>
<p>Then, after a word of parting, Volker turned and made off on his own way.  I watched him with many thoughts, sensing his gait, while tall and proud, walk a mite more slowly than before.</p>
<p><i>‘With your eyes, see the state of our society.  With your compass, judge what Man’s deeds have wrought upon my people.’</i></p>
<p>Though he scarce said such a thing, I well-heard Alban’s bidding in my ears.  And what a mountainous bidding to oblige it was.</p>
<p>But oblige it I will.</p>
<p>Straightening myself, I set forth into the destined district.</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>
<p>I walked upon the dirt paths, delirious as they were with dingy wooden dwellings jutting every which way.  Cobwebs of clothes-lines threaded around and all about without aim.  And lining the waysides were scatterings of sullen and soiled folk, down on their bottoms, down on their luck, downcast, downtrodden.</p>
<p>A shantytown, through and through, made only more dreary by the ever-growing gloom of evening.  Hensen was a fólkheimr formerly arising out of little else but oaken abodes of old.  A mild majesty permeated it, to be sure, but none of the marvel was to be found here.</p>
<p>True to Volker’s words, no eyes gave much of their time to my presence, high-heighted and Man-like though it was.  Glances might’ve been given here and there, but the smallfolk’s hearts certainly heeded me not.  They were all of them ensnared in their daily desperation, a shared destiny brought upon them by some past tragedy.  Seeing the citizenry in their squalor, I thought then how easily Mia herself might’ve ended up amongst them—or worse still.</p>
<p>A place of penury, beyond any doubt.  The home of the forlorn, fringefolk forgotten by the fates.  Nowhere was felt the freshness of life, of vitality, of vivacity.  This townscape was wholly sunken in its own sombre air.</p>
<p><i>“Gwagghaaaa—!!”</i></p>
<p>And through that very air: an ear-splitting scream.</p>
<p>I jerked in its direction, finding a nondescript alleyway.  Many of the nearby Nafílim, too, turned the same way, but, with only misery in their miens, moved nary a limb to go look.  Theirs seemed the spirit of surrender, as if knowing that naught in their power could prove a remedy.</p>
<p>Yet what darkened my heart most was that the scream was of a child.</p>
<p>Unable to remain deaf to it, I stepped into the alleyway, where waiting at its end was a somewhat sizeable home.  Its timbers were tumbled, its roof ragged and reclined, and its walls welcomed in the winds.</p>
<p><i>“Ah… agh… aghhaaaa!!”</i></p>
<p>From within the abode shrieked the same vociferous voice.</p>
<p>The doorway was doorless.  Draped over it was some tattered cloth, one I quickly crossed on peril of trespassing.</p>
<p><i>“Ach… hagh… nnnggh!!”</i></p>
<p>There, a scene to sunder to the heart.</p>
<p>Children, all about—weeping, wailing.</p>
<p><i>“Aaaagh!  Uwghaaaahh!!”</i></p>
<p>And the source of the screams: a young boy, flat upon a floor-laid mat.  His eyes were bulging open, his lungs heaved with every scream, and his limbs were deathly tense as they waved and scratched wildly about.</p>
<p>Near him were five other little ones, boys and girls both, clinging tremulously to each other, their cheeks wet with tears.  Each was fixed upon the youth, hysterical with a sadness no child should suffer.</p>
<p>Yet there was another girl, longer in her years than the rest, but young all the same.</p>
<p>“Brother!  Oh, Brother!”</p>
<p>“Theo!  Theo!  Don’t give up, Theo!  Please!  Plea—se!”</p>
<p><i>“Uuaaah!  …Hic!</i>  Brother, don’t di—e!  <i>Waaah!”</i></p>
<p>The collective lament of the children.</p>
<p>Amongst them: a little sister, calling out to her frantic and fading brother.  Tears coursed and coursed down her snivelling face.  Clasped in her arm was a plush bear, threadbare, and poorly patched here and there with ill-matching shreds of fabric.  Buttons were its eyes, though only one now remained.</p>
<p>Crushed by pity, I but stood there, fast frozen.  Rolf Buckmann, feller of the catoblepas—a battle where was witnessed not a pause in his facing of the beast.  An unsung merit to my name, yet in spite of it, I could do little but stand silent and stolid aface the suffering of these children.</p>
<p><i>“Gghhwah…!  Aghhh…!”</i> the screaming continued, and with it, the wails from the little ones.</p>
<p>“Brother!  Don’t leave us!!  Please!  Alma will be good from now on!  Please!!”</p>
<p><i>“Uuaaaah!  Waaaah!”</i></p>
<p>“Theo!  Stay with us, Theo!  Stay strong!”</p>
<p>There—corroboration from the adolescent girl as she struggled to still the boy’s thrashing spasms.  Amidst her desperation was a sudden swivel of the eyes up to me.  In that stare: a look I’d seen never before.</p>
<p>A look that pleaded for succour, any at all.</p>
<p>A look that fumed with fury for the world and all.</p>
<p>A look that was a lightning bolt upon the ice binding me in place—at once, I rushed into the room, as if freshly unfettered.</p>
<p>“Clear the way!  I’ll hold his legs!” I yelled above the clamour, before catching and clamping down the boy’s buffeting feet.</p>
<p><i>“Ughhah…!  Gghah…!”</i>  On and on, he strained and thrashed, possessed by some demon of a distemper.</p>
<p>I looked to the adolescent girl.  “Give him a thing to bite!  Cloth, wood—aught at all!”</p>
<p>Heeding me, she glanced hurriedly about before turning to the children.  “Kurt!  That stick there!  Hand it to me!  And Romy!  The blue box, on the shelf!  Bring it here!”</p>
<p>The trembling children, too, heeded in turn, and tearfully fulfilled the girl’s bidding.  About the room they then scrambled in clumsy panick.  I watched on, weathering the boy’s wutherings, my heart sinking at the sight of their sniffling and quivering selves.</p>
<p>“You—have him bite this!  My hands are needed elsewhere!” the eldest girl next said, thrusting the newly retrieved stick to me.</p>
<p>With my legs holding down the boy’s own, I obliged.  An action fighting to fail, for the boy himself was bursting at the seams with violent strength, as if his very life were ablaze in its last moments.  Only with my full and burly weight were his legs held in place.</p>
<p>His chin fast in my hand, I then forced open his mouth and wedged the stick between his frothing teeth.</p>
<p><i>“Ouummhh──!  Mmmgh──!!”</i></p>
<p>“Theo!  Come, bite down!!”  The adolescent girl, seeing the ailing boy obeying, took to hand a blue box.  “Hold him still!  Just like that!  Kurt!  Come help, as well!  Don’t let him flail now!”</p>
<p>Whilst dictating the chaos, the girl took out of the box a porcelain phial.</p>
<p><i>“Ugghh!  Ffhhnngg──!!”</i></p>
<p>“Brother!  Brother, please!!  Don’t die!!”</p>
<p>“Theo!!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Brother!!  Brother─!!”</p>
<p><i>“Waaaah!  Aauuaaah!”</i></p>
<p>The children cried.  On and on, each and every one.  No cheek was unflooded with tears.</p>
<p>My face furrowed at the scene.  Gasping breaths grated their way out of my lungs, as though I’d fast forgotten how to breathe.  An unexpected sheen of sweat was upon me—my mind, my heart, laboured away at a war unlike any I’d waged before.  Swimming against the tide of emotions, I continued on holding down the boy with all desperation.</p>
<p>“Theo!  Be strong!” the eldest girl shouted.  “You, have the stick gone!  He must drink now!”</p>
<p>I did as told, gripping the boy’s chin before freeing the stick from his gnashing bite.  In the same moment, the girl leant in and poured into the boy’s mouth a liquor from the phial.  And right as the remedy was emptied, I swiftly wedged the stick back in.</p>
<p><i>“Gghhnnnngghh──!!”</i></p>
<p>A guttural groan from the boy, punctuated by a crack from the stick between his teeth.  It was for the best; without it, he might’ve very well bitten off his own tongue.</p>
<p><i>“Gghh… nngghh… hhghh…”</i></p>
<p>And then, a peace, setting in piecemeal—the boy’s mad flailing finally began to abate.  If only the same were true of his eyes, which remained wide open, twitching here and there.  Unsure of his condition, I continued keeping him still as best I could.</p>
<p><i>“Gh… urh…”</i></p>
<p>The moments released their tension, for at last, the boy’s eyelids drew to a gentle close.  And once the girl removed the stick from his mouth, all that left it then were the shallow sighs of slumber.</p>
<p>I followed suit, freeing a deep breath from my lungs after letting myself off of the boy’s once-bedevilled limbs.</p>
<p>The children’s wails had ceased.  What remained were only their soft sobs.</p>


<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>


<p>The curtains of night were fast fallen.  With not a seam in the cloud-cloaked skies to welcome in the moonlight, the townscape was left awash in grainy eigengrau, cut only by the occasional wick-light.</p>
<p>All the district folk had disappeared to their midnight nests.  A brisk chill ran through the chirping air.  I stood amidst the clean quietude, having left the children’s home, and leant on the bannister by the road.  It overlooked a plaza below, a space as gaping as it was lonely.</p>
<p>“Well?” rang a voice beside me, one belonging to the remedy-giving girl.  “What business welcomes a Man in this unwelcome place?”</p>
<p>It was only after she’d soothed and settled the children down that this girl thought to bring me out for a talk.  But of course she would.  Doubtless she expected no Man to appear at her moment of need—more unexpected again that he would sooner be an aid than an adversary.</p>
<p>“The name’s Rolf, first off,” I began my answer.  “As for business—I was come bearing tidings for the jarl.”</p>
<p>“Hm.  Fair enough,” she seemed to brush off.  “‘Lise’ be mine.  You’ve a pair of helpful hands.  My thanks.”</p>
<p>Not upon the lithe person of this “Lise” was there a wisp of fright for the presence of Men.  Why, for one such Man did she even deign to thank for helping a spasmodic child.</p>
<p>“That boy…” I broached, recalling that very episode.  “The white-coath’s got him, has it?”</p>
<p>“It has,” Lise sighed.  “He’s amongst many who were poisoned… not more than a winter ago.”</p>
<p>“White-coath”—a ghastliness afflicting both Men and Nafílim alike, the symptoms of which were all exhibited by the poor boy.</p>
<p>As for the cause, I hazarded a grim guess.</p>
<p>“&#8230;Drank from the forest headwaters, I wager.”</p>
<p>“You wager well.  Yes…  Mennish realmers made it a miasma,” confirmed Lise, before leering slowly up at me.  “Remember you the waters?  Fresh and cool?”</p>
<p>Deep in her sidelong stare sparked embers of spite.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Why, we once had it done t’great effect, ‘fore your arrival…!’</i></p>

<p>Ebbe’s words.</p>
<p>…And Ebbe’s wiles.</p>
<p>A ploy to poison the headwaters within the woods, one I was swift to strike down.  Only, just as he had hinted, its effectiveness was well-attested.  The boy was palpable proof of it, a living and ailing victim.  Though, for how much longer…</p>
<p>I ground my teeth.  Once again has this war reaped from fields far from its waging.  By its wantonness did innocents now suffer anew…</p>
<p>…and children along with them.</p>
<p>Little children—<i>suffering.</i></p>
<p>I let out a sigh of my own.  “Can’t say I do; the poisoning well-happened before my coming to this land.  Though… I admit, I’ve known of the deed for some time.  And I’m yet a soldier of Londosius, all told.  Thus the sin stains me no less heavily.”</p>
<p>“Mm…”  The flames faded from Lise’s look.  “Light enough upon my scale, I say.  So long as the deed wasn’t yours, if true.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Quite the generous scale you have.”</p>
<p>“You prefer a stricter one?”</p>
<p>Her words seemed a cold dagger, quicker on the cut than on the coddle for the moping, maudlin Man before her.</p>
<p>“Nay…” I relented.  “It judges me just fine.”</p>
<p>“Be glad.  Had any more heavily your sin slanted the scale, I’d happily hew the weight from you.”</p>
<p>Such was no middling attempt at intimidation.  Hers were hands well-whetted for war-waging.  And bloodied besides, perhaps—from felling Men.  That much I discerned merely from her portance.</p>
<p>But of her heart, I then wished to discern further.  Thus, through the dark, I threw my entire gaze upon her visage.  And as I did, a cleft in the clouds softly courted in a shaft of moonshine.</p>
<p>One alighting perfectly upon Lise.</p>
<p>Amidst the luminance came a blush of warm beige about her skin, a complexion unique to the Nafílim.  The fine and fair features of her face, the bright emerald of her eyes, the lily-rosiness of her lips, the gossamer-gold of her hip-length locks—all lovely to behold, but what bewildered me was not that.</p>
<p>No, not at all.</p>
<p>For the sight of her face was one I once well-thought to be my last.</p>
<p>The Battle of Erbelde three years past.</p>
<p>Having undone the dam choking the tributary—a Nafílim construction and counter-stratagem that saw the swelling of the Erbelde’s main waters—I successfully made my return to the Mareschal Tiselius’ regiment.  And after reporting to her the weakness in the enemy’s designs, victory seemed all but clenched.  Thus was the brunt of our forces ordered to drive our foes to their retreat, whilst the rest of us followed Tiselius in exiting the enemy garrison.</p>
<p>Then and there, just as we neared the gates and regrouped with a regiment of stationed knights, we were waylaid from the shadows by a horde of Nafílim, one of whom I found myself fighting to fatal peril.</p>
<p>My opponent: a girl of a Nafíl, younger still than my then-seventeen year-old self.  But in her hands was wielded undeniable prowess, daggers of deftness and speedy death.  Certainly a Goliath to an ungraced.</p>
<p>I can hear it, even now: the thrice-striking thunders of a gong, as blood issued from the slash-wound sailing across my bosom.  And then…</p>

<p><i>‘&#8230;The curtains look to be closing…’</i></p>
<p><i>‘&#8230;‘Twas a play too-brief…’</i></p>
<p><i>‘&#8230;Now’s a fine time to exit stage… wouldn’t you say…?’</i></p>
<p><i>‘&#8230;Will we meet again…?’</i></p>
<p><i>‘&#8230;The playwrights willing…’</i></p>

<p>…then, did she disappear from my sight.</p>
<p>In facing such a foe did I first know mortal fear.</p>

<p>“&#8230;I know you.”</p>
<p>Simple words said with the very same voice from that memory.</p>
<p>A memory, just as fresh in the mind of the girl before me.  The passing of three winters now found her a blossomed young lady, betwixt sixteen and eighteen in her years.  Indeed, though her facets were now well-refined, she was unmistakably the same storm-child with whom I measured blades on that fateful battlefield.</p>
<p>“And I, you,” I echoed.  “We meet again.”</p>
<p>To which Lise answered with a long look upon my person, her first cutting sign of caution since my appearance.</p>
<p>“Again the curtains rise,” she remarked, “to herald the one Man of my defeat.”</p>
<p>“Hm?” I cocked a brow.  “If memory serves, the defeat was mine—miserably so.”</p>
<p><i>“Huh?”</i>  Lise cocked both of hers.  “There’s nonsense on your lips!”</p>
<p>“Nay, I’ve proof enough.  Here, look—” I insisted, before shedding off my shirt to show Lise the scar of her making.</p>
<p>“Wh…?” she gasped.  “W-why do you bare yourself!?”</p>
<p>“This here.  See it?” I looked down upon myself.  “A scar by your blade.”</p>
<p>“W-which!?” Lise looked away.  “Fewer stars line the skies than do the scars on your skin!”</p>
<p>I pointed at my chest.  “This one, the starkest of them.  A long, straight lin—”</p>
<p>“Fine!  Yes-yes!  I see it!  Clothe yourself already!”</p>

<div class="wp-block-image">
<figure class="aligncenter size-large"><img data-lazy-fallback="1" decoding="async" src="https://i0.wp.com/lightnovelstranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sskvol2illus07.png?resize=759%2C1079&#038;ssl=1" alt="" width="759" height="1079" class="wp-image-118077" data-recalc-dims="1" /></figure>
</div>

<p>Upon her face fast came a fluster of another hue.  A blunder on my part, perhaps, to bare myself so boldly.  Warriors that we were, I had well-thought it proper to display the trophy of her triumph hewn into my very flesh.</p>
<p>“Apologies,” I said, slipping my shirt back on.  “I meant to say: you proved quite the sharp opponent.”</p>
<p>“Hmph…” Lise crossed her arms.  “A silly lie, that.  From the lips of one sharper still, who so outsped my ambush.”</p>
<p>Ambush, indeed.  Just the mere recollection of it sent shivers down my spine.</p>
<p>Instinct had saved me then.  A wordless sense that something sinister—or “bestial”, more like—was shooting straight into our ranks.  And it was instinct again that had forced my hand: a draw of the sword, the swing of its blade.</p>
<p>At the end of the edge was none other than a Nafílim girl: Lise, caught in the instant before her blades could catch me, her paling having halted mine.  Truth be told, had I hesitated even for an instant, that day, that battle, surely would’ve been my last.</p>
<p>“I’m haunted even now,” said my former foe, looking to have recollected the same.  “Tell me.  What gift gave you sight enough to see my strike?”</p>
<p>“The gift was yours: the raging, <i>bestial</i> sort.  I but sensed it, is all.”</p>
<p><i>“B…!?”</i>  Lise’s eyes flared wide and greenly.  “And yours be a gift for <i>rudeness,</i> I sense!”</p>
<p>Had she hissed, she very well might’ve seemed the incensed cat.  I was convinced: my choosing of words had yet to grow beyond the grace of a gutter-churl’s.</p>
<p>“Ah…  A-apologies,” I scratched my head.  “It was a compliment, truly.”</p>
<p>“What frau finds flattery in ‘raging beast’, you bumble-wit!”</p>
<p>“One who’s a warrior besides.  Am I wrong?”</p>
<p>“No!  And yes!”</p>
<p>It would seem we are as cogs uncouplable, Lise and I.  Regardless, such was my reunion with an old opponent, with whom I once exchanged swings and thrusts swift enough to sunder the winds.</p>
<p>But between us now were stilled breezes and broken moonlight.</p>
<p>A miracle of a re-meeting well-earning my joy.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>Under dimly lilting moonlight, Lise and I continued on with our conversation.  In its course, I related to her the reason for my arrival here in Hensen.</p>
<p>The surprise on her face was, by this point, no surprise to me.  My position as Balasthea’s acting commandant, my desire to stay the imminent slaughter of Hensen’s innocents—to Lise, it was one whelming revelation after another.</p>
<p>What a wayward Man I must’ve seemed to her.  Only after I recounted my audience with the Jarl Alban did she at last nod convincedly.</p>
<p>“A liking he’s likely taken to you, that father of mine.”</p>
<p>The pendulum of surprise now swung my way.  Never could I have thought the jarl’s own daughter to be the damsel standing beside me.</p>
<p>Just as Volker had revealed, this exact district was purposed for the welfare of Hensenfolk harried by disease and destitution.  Though from the look of things, the welfare had long waned to a wisp of its requisite vigour.  Hence why the district was graced with the presence of Alban’s own bloodkin: at his behest was it made Lise’s charge, to lend ear to the needs of its needy, to secure succour for its fates-spurned citizens.</p>
<p>I gave a convinced nod myself as Lise further explained the plight of this place.  By her words, the children earlier were without parents.  How such came to be, Lise seemed short of spirit to say.  Not that I could blame her; merely guessing conjured echoes in my ears—those of the children’s cries.</p>
<p>How bitter their young tears must’ve been, to find one day their parents forever parted from them.</p>
<p>And given the fraughtness of the folk here, I could not imagine any with means enough to take the orphans in as their own.  So it was that those children lived on in a home of only children.</p>
<p>That the little ones yet drew breath was thanks in no small part to Lise and her colleagues.  On the daily did they visit the broken home, taking turns to look after the children and to provide provisions as needed, that the little ones might live with some semblance of comfort.</p>
<p>Still, I could see in Lise’s eyes that their pitiful lot yet warranted much worry, as amongst the children was the boy beset by white-coath.  A fortune as foul as it was fickle, for there was no knowing when another spasmodic episode might assail him.</p>
<p>“The physick you gave the boy,” I recalled, “one pays with whole purses for just a potion of it, no?”</p>
<p>“Purses and more,” Lise replied.  “Though we Vílungen are ever light of purse.  Such heavy remedies be hard-bought.”</p>
<p>But bought nonetheless.</p>
<p>For to willingly scribe the boy’s name on the long list of the war-lost exacted a price unpayable by any purse.  This, Lise went on to say.  And with her did I share the same mind.  But in doing so was a new weight of the war heavy upon my shoulders.  Burdened, I let my gaze fall.</p>
<p>It was then that something caught my eye.</p>
<p>In the emptied plaza below, a peculiarity—some structure, like a watchtower, whittled down to a minute scale.</p>
<p>…Nay.  It seemed more an altar, affixed with a roof of its own.  And under it… an offering of some sort?  To the vættir spirits, perhaps?</p>
<p>“That, down there in the plaza,” I pointed.  “What is it?”</p>
<p>“Ah, that,” said Lise, as if lifted by the new topic.  “Care to have a look?”</p>
<p>A “look”?  Was it really some reliquary on public display?  I couldn’t help but oblige, ever blindly curious for folkways unfamiliar.  With a nod, I followed Lise down the path before descending a set of steps.  Planted at the plaza, we approached the tabernacle-like construction.</p>
<p>There, beneath meagre rafters, piercing straight up out of a platform, was a sword.</p>
<p>Dedications of the bladed sort are by no means outlandish in any land.  Here, however, outlandishness was in the sword itself: from edge to edge, ridge to pommel, a weapon subsumed by its own stark-sable skin.  Like a gaping void gouged into the very air, taking what silhouette but that of a sword, beckoning belookers to the bottomless blackness within.</p>
<p>Indeed, a curiosity counter to all convention.</p>
<p>“What’s this…?” I wondered aloud, doubting my eyes.  “&#8230;It seems a sword, and yet…”</p>
<p>“That, we call <i>svǫrtaskan…”</i> Lise confirmed, “&#8230;the soot-steel.”</p>
<p><i>Soot?</i></p>
<p>To once again come across it in so far a place as these foe-lands—evidently, the fates found it mete to further steep my lot in the lightless ash.</p>
<p>“Blacker than aught and all I’ve seen before.  It swallows all sight,” I observed, staring at the sword with all intensity.  “What composes it?”</p>
<p><i>“Aschenblei</i>—the wayward iron, twice heavier than silver.”</p>
<p>Raised were my brows.  “‘Aschenblei’?  I’ve read of it.  ‘Wolfsteel’—or <i>úlfstál,</i> as they call it in the Hinternorth, if memory serves.”</p>
<p>My thoughts turned to the dusty texts, wherein was described the selfsame metal.  A ghost of a rarity, the existence of wolfsteel finds few believers in Londosius.  But those in the know are privy to the discoveries of actual ore specimens, scant though they may be.</p>
<p>And this they say: it is the heaviest and hardest of all known metals in this mortal plane.</p>
<p>On and on, I looked all along the length of bladed darkness.  “Though the books give a grey lustre to the lupine metal.  Not the abyssal black I see before me.”</p>
<p>“It <i>was</i> grey.  Once upon a time, at least,” Lise revealed.  “The sword—‘tis <i>ashened.”</i></p>
<p>…’Ashened,’ she said?</p>
<p>What ash could so solidly sustain the form of a sword?</p>
<p>The questions only piled up in my pate.</p>
<p>“Our tales tell of a battle here, once held betwixt two dragons—the <i>gamalldrekinn</i> Gweil&#8217;ǫrr and the <i>kyndandrekinn</i> J̌yfæ—in the far days of the <i>Tívafornár,”</i> Lise explained.  “‘Twas in the throes that Gweil&#8217;ǫrr’s baleful breath bore down upon the earth.  And bathed in the flames: this very sword.”</p>
<p>Her recital sorted squarely with the old sagas.</p>
<p>Gweil&#8217;ǫrr, elder dragon, judged magick to be a misbegotten creation, a rogue run flowing straight astray from the erstwhile workings of life itself.  And thus not few were the depictions of discord between he and J̌yfæ, a like dragon, but of an unlike mind.  For it was this same J̌yfæ who kindled the <i>seiðr,</i> mother-spark of all magicks.</p>
<p>Here, too, at where would become Hensen did the two dragons break and burn the land with their battling.  And by Lise’s retelling, this sword was seared to soot in the process.</p>
<p>“&#8230;What little legendaria I’ve come across do indeed describe Gweil&#8217;ǫrr’s flames as possessing heat enough to ‘turn steel to ash’, as it were,” I remarked.  “To think—it was more fact than fiction all this time.”</p>
<p>Or a forgery, perhaps?  Before me, a mere mimickry of the myths?  Yet I could only conclude to the contrary.  To behold with my naked eyes a material memory of mythical antiquity—it was all more than enough to send my heart dancing up to the clouds.</p>
<p>“W-well… a chronicler I’m not, you should know.  I but echoed our oral traditions; whether they ring true or no is anyone’s guess,” Lise quickly tempered my expectations.  “The svǫrtaskan seems ashened, sure enough.  But how that came to be, of dragon-fire and bygone battles, is all just an old tale.”</p>
<p>“A tale I well-wish were true.”</p>
<p>As it must be.  This, my hunch told me, however hushed it may have been.  For while it was certain that the soot-sword’s blackness blocked all sight, it could not conceal its own fey nature.</p>
<p>“Tales aside, ashened úlfstál fascinates no less…” I went on.  “Its natural endurance is matched by no other metal known.  Yet, to be tempered <i>further</i> still?  It baffles the mind.”</p>
<p>“Baffling, yes.  But a marvel?  Who can know?  We, its stewards, certainly cannot.  None amongst our remembered generations have ever wielded this, you see,” Lise confessed.  “The hilt, the blade—one touches the blacksword on peril of piercing pain… and burns most terrible to behold.”</p>
<p>“With just a touch?” I said, instinctively leaning away from the sable specimen.  “Truly, now?”</p>
<p>“Yes, truly.  A truth tested to our woe.  Neither glove nor gauntlet even avails.  And so here it stands—unmoved, unchanged.”</p>
<p>A sword suffering no wielder, scorning and scorching any hand laid upon it—yet another affrighting facet to this witch of a weapon.  But… why?  Why was it, that in spite of its spurning grimness, I could not bear to break my gaze away from it?</p>
<p>I felt then as if spellbound to its boundless blackness.  As though my very soul were being sucked into an abyss.</p>
<p>“Though like all swords, it might’ve known a master once.  Our myths also remember soot asail behind each swing of the blade,” Lise added.  “‘Soot-steep’d be he who holds fast this fey-sword,’ they further say.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;Hence ‘soot-steel’.  Convincing enough.”</p>
<p>The black weapon waits.</p>
<p>Such was what I espied after hearing much of what little was known of it.</p>
<p>But if wait it does, then for what?</p>
<p>For <i>whom?</i></p>
<p>And in this den of the destitute, of all places?</p>
<p>A quicksand of questions, one I was pulled out of not by an answer, but by a sense of being watched by eyes from above.  There, up on the path where Lise and I were less than a while ago, stood a silhouette, rotund and familiar to my eyes: Berta, one of the attendant war-chiefs of the jarl.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>“Lise!” came a call ringing clear through the night.  “Is that you there?”</p>
<p>“Berta!  You’ve come!” answered Lise, whereupon a pall of mirth bloomed on her cheeks, and with it, a breeziness to her bounding feet as she flew back up the steps.  I traced her trail, arriving a moment later.</p>
<p>“How now,” Berta’s brows arched, sighting me over Lise’s shoulder.  “What has brought you here of all places?”</p>
<p>“The jarl’s bidding, evidently.  He seemed rather intent on showing me the plight of your people,” I explained, before glancing to Lise.  “Though meeting his daughter along the way was mere coincidence.”</p>
<p>“Coincidence, you say?  Well, hardly queer given the day’s course!  <i>Ho ho!”</i> chuckled Berta, patting her belly in good humour.</p>
<p>For her part, Lise looked back and forth between us in wonder.  “Ah—acquainted already, I see.”</p>
<p>The chatter carried on as we all wended our way back to the children’s home, during which I learnt that Berta, too, shared in Lise’s worries for this district.  Dire amongst them was the dilemma of the children themselves, deprived of parents as they were.  It was for that reason that Berta gave much of her time to tend to their troubled abode.</p>
<p>“Rather rare of late, Theo’s symptoms?” Berta asked.  “A peek of the sun through grey clouds, were it so from here on.”</p>
<p>“Berta…” Lise greyly began, “&#8230;Theo, he’s suffered a spasm earlier.”</p>
<p>A gasp.  “He what!?  H-how fares he now!?”</p>
<p>The war-chief’s cheer was all but withered at once.  In its place: a panicked portance, the first I’d seen sallowing her, and as well, a testament to how dearly she tasked her heart to the little ones.</p>
<p>“The physick proved the fix,” Lise soothed.  “He sleeps soundly.”</p>
<p>“G-goodness…  Oh, goodness…!” Berta freed her bated breaths.  But the relief did little to stay her newfound haste as she hurried on inside the home.</p>
<p>Voices of joy soon jumped from the abode’s many mouseholes and hollows.</p>
<p>“A—h!  It’s Auntie Berta!”</p>
<p>“Berta!  Berta!”</p>
<p>Inside, a single lantern was lit.  Shadows once still now danced as the children were roused.</p>
<p>“Now, now, not too loudly.  Theo needs his rest,” said Berta, before bending down to her knees.  “To me, my dears!”</p>
<p>Not a second later and the little ones were lilting and laughing all around the rotund woman.  Vivid on all their visages were sunny smiles.  A moment of joy against the dreariness, one that well-revealed Berta’s belovedness.</p>
<p>“Auntie, Auntie!” one amongst the children called.  “Me and Nora ran errands today!  Just the two of us!”</p>
<p>“Well, aren’t you both a dependable pair!” Berta beamed more brightly.  “You lost not your way, did you, dear?”</p>
<p>A giggle.  “Almost!”</p>
<p>“Auntie!  Can I massage your shoulders?  Lise said I’m good at it!” a little boy boasted.</p>
<p>“Did she, now?  Well then, let’s measure how much of a masseur you be!”</p>
<p>From a little further in rose a rustle.</p>
<p>A boy, once flat on a floormat, slowly awoke to the disquieted air.  Curious, he rubbed his eyes and looked about, breaking a great grin upon finding Berta.</p>
<p>“Auntie!” he shouted brightly.</p>
<p>“Theo, dear!  You’re up!” Berta returned.  “Goodness, forgive the clamour.  How fare you, my little champion?”</p>
<p>“Never felt better!”</p>
<p>Amidst the merry commotion, one of the children caught sight of me as I stood beside the doorway.  The young pair of eyes sparkled with awe, as though discovering a curio.</p>
<p>“Ah!  You’re the mister from before!”</p>
<p>That one pair was now many, as all in the home set their gazes upon me.</p>
<p>“Oh?  Is that a Man?” Theo wondered aloud.  “First I’ve seen with my eyes.”</p>
<p>“That he is,” Lise assured him, and everyone else next.  “A Man—and my friend.”</p>
<p>“Lise has a new friend?” echoed one of the children.</p>
<p>I bowed.  “The name’s Rolf.  A pleasure.”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you, mister!”</p>
<p>The home was then aflutter with further greetings from the little ones.  A cheery exchange, to be sure, during which I well-learnt one thing: the grown ones here were not wont to teach their young the foe-like fearfulness of Man-folk.</p>

<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;We judge for what a heart beats…<br />
…not what blood courses through it…’</i></p>

<p>Now more than ever did Volker’s words ring true.</p>
<p>“Auntie, Auntie!  Will you stay tonight?”</p>
<p>“Hmm,” Berta gave half a moment’s thought before teasingly half-nodding.  “Mayhaps.”</p>
<p>“Ya—y!”</p>
<p>The children then chirped and jumped for joy.  After having their fill of frolicking, they gathered once more around the girth of their dear auntie.  And what girth indeed, for each of the five children was snug and sound in Bertha’s wide embrace.</p>
<p>The war-chief glowed with the mirth of a mother as she went on lending ear to all the little ones’ words, no matter how incoherent, no matter how trifling.</p>
<p>A sight of precious serenity, which, upon meeting her eyes, earned a soft smile from Lise’s lips.</p><p style="text-align: center"><strong>♰</strong></p>

<p>The dusky hour fell deeper still, till the little ones were all of them fast asleep, their springtide vitality well-sapped from many an impassioned prattle had with their auntie.</p>
<p>“You seem the mother-tree to these children, were they faeries,” I remarked, as we three adults were all sat anear the waning lantern.</p>
<p><i>“Oho!”</i> Berta’s shoulders lifted with subdued laughter.  “A fair little faerie Lise was, too, in her time.”</p>
<p>“B-Berta!” came Lise’s gust of a whisper.  “I-I’m grown now.  A frau full-graduated from frolicking ‘round you all day!”</p>
<p>“You are, at that,” Berta’s voice fell.  “Ah, the days.”</p>
<p>Words brushed with nostalgia, but warmed by pride beneath.  To the war-chief, there was perhaps no joy greater than the growth of the many youths of her charge.</p>
<p>“You’ve long looked after such lost children, I take it?” I asked her.</p>
<p>“You take aright.  My body be barren, see,” Berta confessed, hand upon her belly.  “I once walked the warrior’s way, but when my heart saw the hurt in our poor children, my feet found another path.”</p>
<p>“Another path, you say…”</p>
<p>I knew anew then, that in this world so awash in blood feuds, there were yet folk who walked the difficult path of dignity.  Folk who, with nary a whisper of doubt in their hearts, yet saw immense meaning in defending the meek and miserable.  Besides Berta, there was Eva and the matron Irma at the orphanage.  Lise, too, bore this weighty lustre no less brightly.</p>
<p>Such knowledge served a great solace.</p>
<p>Thereafter did we mingle further on myriad matters.  In its course, I found myself deeply moved by the very moment: sworn enemies sat beside one another, amidst the waxing bellows of war abroad, exchanging not blows and curses, but common interests and concerns.  From the climate of this corner of the world, to the histories of both Men and Nafílim—conversations most benign, continuing from one topic to another without wane.</p>
<p>How pleasant they were, Lise and Berta.  In spite of all the turmoil exacted upon their people, they yet found reason for friendliness with their foe.</p>
<p>It was then that I revealed myself to be an ungraced—a Man void of the odyl so instilled in all nascent Nafílim.  Lise had, for the longest time, wondered why it was that her neck was spared of my sword-strike—not once, but twice—in the fading moments of the Battle of Erbelde.  The reason, too, I related to her.</p>
<p>The deed very well bared my mortal flaw.  Passing strange that I felt not a hint of hesitation in telling them of it.</p>
<p>“So <i>that’s</i> why!”</p>
<p>“Oh!  You poor thing.  A trying life you have trod.”</p>
<p>The revelation seemed to stir neither sight nor scent of antipathy from the two.  Expected, for the Nafílim were no lambs of Yoná.  Still, their lack of scorn was a breath of fresh air.</p>
<p>Berta turned to me as I was aglow in gladness.</p>
<p>“Ah, yes.  Your earlier counsel—the jarl heeds it,” she reported.  “The west-side folk evacuate as we speak.”</p>
<p>“It’s started, now?” I said with genuine surprise.  “Your jarl’s hands are as swift as his ears.”</p>
<p>It was no later than noontide when I entreated the jarl to prepare his people for the Fiefguard’s coming foray.  Yet to begin the evacuation before the day has even turned well-betrayed my expectation.</p>
<p>“That he is!  Long in his years he may be, but the passing winters only whet further his wits,” Berta nodded.  “And your counsel was mete enough for his measure.  The evacuation proceeds from the west gate on.  Come next morrow, this very district moves, as well.”</p>
<p>“And you came to tell the elders of this, Berta?” Lise asked.</p>
<p>“I did.  Only, our words waxed too deep into the dusk; everyone went to sleep before we finished,” the war-chief chuckled.  “And so I stay the night here.  But at dawn, we move and I lead.”</p>
<p>“That settles it, then.  I’ll stay the night, as well,” Lise decided with a smile.</p>
<p>I then thought to bid my goodbyes, seeing as the hour of sleep had set in.</p>
<p>Only…</p>
<p>…a chill next ran down my spine.</p>
<p>“Mm?  Rolf?”</p>
<p>The mirth upon Lise’s lips had hardly faded, as faint in the west window behind her…</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>…was the hum of an ill-light.</p>
<p>My eyes darted to the children nearby, deep in their safe slumber.  The fragile sight sent me shooting up to my feet.  Turning my back to Lise’s inquiring voice, I then thundered out of the house, and as soon as I could, set my eyes to the western skies.</p>
<p>The ill-light was no illusion.</p>
<p>For it was red.</p>
<p>And roaring.</p>

<p>The fólkheimr was aflame.</p>

<p>My ears next corroborated the omen—from the distance, the dim din of bellicose howls and hoofbeats.  Lise and Berta both were soon beside me, aghast at the grimness.  In their wide eyes, too, was the reflection of red-rife skies.</p>
<p>The jarl was quick, but his foes were quicker, for it was evident that the very day I had set off from Balasthea was the same as the Fiefguard’s opening march.</p>
<p>There was no doubt, then.</p>
<p>Londosius’ lions of war were come to hunt.</p>
