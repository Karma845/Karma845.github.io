<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Östbergs.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Down the watchtower steps they wended.  Strength seemed to strum in their very strut.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But I would first know your will,” I shouted to them from below, bearing my voice above the distant din of battle.  “You’ll not sue for your safe surrender, I take it?  To lay down your arms aside your slain, who number now half your failing host?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such I asked of the sister, whose sliding gauntlet upon the railing roused a ringing hiss through the air.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You take aright,” she answered.  “Half a host is quite the bargain for that head of yours.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“One to be plated and served before Central, no doubt,” I guessed with narrowed gaze, earning a faint smile from the Zaharte captain as she alighted upon firm ground.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The prey knows his plight,” she remarked.  “How—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola’s words vanished.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Air whooshed; her form, too, was gone.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Blurring unto my bosom now was a hawk-speed spearhead, like a limb of levin, in an instant traversing a stretch of many strides.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Bringing my blackblade in, I guarded against the bald ambush, extinguishing its odyl withal and swinging back in answer… only, I didn’t.  Such was Viola’s desire, her very her tactic: to tempt my defence and thin my thoughts from Theodor, who would surely wind about to spear me from behind.  Nay, espying their deception, I dared a different answer altogether.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hhet!”</i>  I twisted my torso, letting Viola’s thunderswift thrust pass through where my breast had been.  But the sudden spear was too precise—in its wake splashed a plume of sparks as its enwreathing odyl ran across my breastplate, gashing open the metal and grazing my flesh beneath.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But I merely winced; this was a wound well-accounted for.  Straightway I shot past Viola’s side and assailed Theodor, who trailed just behind his sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Mn!?”</i> he gasped, eyes wide.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Glimpsing my low-stanced sword, Theodor jerked and leapt clear away at once.  Viola followed the instant after, and soon were the siblings reunited, their spears and battle-spirits re-poised.  Had the brother committed instead, fully would he’ve reaped a reprisal from my blade, but alas, both he and his sister had proven that their fame was no fluke.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Our mark moves well, Sis.  <i>Too</i> well…” the Östberg brother muttered.  The grin on his lips was gone; many men would’ve bitten Viola’s bait, only to find Theodor’s spear sprouting out of their bosoms.  That such did not come to pass here seemed to have piqued their caution.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A hart, holding his own against hunters as honed as we.  Fancy that,” Viola said to me.  “Or might you be a hunter yourself?  Long on the trail for <i>our</i> heads?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The predator doubts her odds,” I retorted.  “How—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Now was it my words that vanished—or were stolen, rather, as speeding unto me once more was Viola, her spear intent upon a lower mark: my thigh.  A different target, a different tactic, likely to lure out my side-retreat instead and set Theodor to waylay the very landing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so for the instant, I stood my ground and swatted away the sister-spear before bounding back by many paces.  Thwarted, Theodor ceased his charge with a stamp, his surprise most apparent even from behind his sibling.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Sis, I daresay he’s studied our spears,” he doubted again.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But Viola shook her head.  “Nay, I say he scries them.  An eagle-eyed wolf we’ve welcomed to our den.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In addressing her brother’s worries did Viola’s visage then shift unto full sharpness—the glare of a lioness.  Down low she bent, as about her spear shaft clenched fingers fain for the hunt.  Then, parting her lips, she drew a gentle breath and uttered:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><strong>“Rugiēns Tempestās.”</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola’s voice: clear as crystal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Her spear: the eye of a storm.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The air whipped as razor winds raged and whistled asudden about her weapon.  Plumes of dust were lifted and sucked into the vortex, nigh-veiling the spear in a formless sheath; the work of an aeolian ensorcellment, moulding a mundane polearm into an all-pulverising maelstrom—a madness of magick, mastered by masterful hands.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hhyah!!”</i> Viola cried, thrusting forth her tempest-spear whence she stood.  From the motion, the maelstrom shrieked and streamed in a twisting stampede, great in size and grinding away the earth as it went.  In my direction, it blasted.  In my eyes, it ballooned.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Heagh!”</i>  I full-heaved my body to bound aside, saving myself from the screaming, slashing cyclone—only to be beset by a thrust from Theodor’s spear.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Kkhangg!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So rang our vying arms, barely audible above the violence of Viola’s vortex.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A wolf, for certain…!” her brother seethed, gnashing his teeth at my timely defence.  Though timely only by a bare margin, for in Theodor, too, was a change: now was his speed a world apart, no doubt amplified by the miracles of his own magicks.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But our exchange lasted not long; the winds wailed again to greater volumes.  Theodor then vanished right from my eyes.  In his absence: another squall of blustering blades, headed right my way.  I fled the fury again with as long a leap as I could muster, only to be ambushed by the Östberg brother once more.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ssyet!”</i> he rasped, his spear lunging as I landed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Frowning, I fended off the attack, “Stubborn—”, and followed with a blade brandished from below, “—much!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Dust and soot sprang in the <i>svǫrtaskan’s</i> slashing wake, only to be blown away by the ambient gusts—within which my mark was nowhere to be found.  No, yonder he stood, having fled the instant his offence had failed.  A textbook example of a hit-and-run, but executed to extraordinary speed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This seemed their style, of how the heads of Zaharte hunt their hares: Viola’s hand was the hound, loosed to lead the target into Theodor’s deathtrap of a spear-charge.  From the outset was this so.  Only now was it revealed to its full and frightful fury, frustrated by an over-elusive prey… or impelled by what prestige my decapitated head would requite them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;My storm, your spear—with skill he skirts both,” Viola remarked to her brother, having joined him anew.  “Rare in this realm, his mettle.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rarer still was their cutthroat cohesion, I’d say.  Waste-laying winds, lightning-speed spears—like a true storm did brother and sister strike.  And the one tasked to its stilling: this lone and yet-wounded swordsman.  What was <i>he</i> to do?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">When pounced by a pack, strike first the chief, as they say.  By all accounts, Viola fit the bill.  Hers was the baton conducting this combat’s rhythm.  If I could wrest it from her, then much advantage would be mine.  Only, there were twisters wielded betwixt us, and such a deathly distance I dared not cross, for “deathly” was no exaggeration: her maelstroms showed clear the sheer potency of her magicks.  A mistake here, and I would be ripped to ribbons.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such was the problem.  What of solutions?  I knew of none yet, but a hint gave me hope enough: to attend Viola’s wild winds and Theodor’s fleet offence—simultaneously.  And in due course might a chance present itself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No jester would dare such a juggle.  But already was I deep in the act, and any errant ball now would spell my swift death.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A fine specimen of an opponent you are, Rolf Buckmann,” said Viola.  “And a seldom opportunity besides, to unfurl our wings in full.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Would that you’ve taken me yet for a timid ungraced,” I said back, “then such a sweat would I not’ve shed.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oh?”  Her smile slanted up like a scytheblade.  “Pity about that.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A regard both recognising the might of her mark and reckoning the gruesome end she would surely wreak upon him.  Most would know despair at this point.  But in this tunnel, I spied a light.  Or rather, a saving shadow, one held fast in my fingers: the soot-steeped piece to solve this puzzle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For the siblings, all begins with the wicked winds spewed by Viola’s spear.  Few are they who would dare challenge such a monstrous magick, but I counted myself not amongst that forlorn lot; cut the currents with the soot-steel, and they would be broken unto breezes.  Then and there could I close the distance and vie for victory.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But neither Viola nor Theodor should be so naïve.  They were seasoned wagers of war.  It was their very livelihood, their very claim to fame.  That I could undo magicks with but a swing of this sable sword ought be known to them by now.  Indeed, their tactics seemed tailored to trounce the very trick.  Play against the twister, and Theodor would surely be there to land the checkmate—at a speed and timing I could scarce answer, no less.  In fact, likely it was that he’d been abiding the very move.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Then should I strike Theodor down first?  Read <i>his</i> manoeuvres right back at him?  And counter in the same instant he sets himself upon me?  A princely ploy, but one checked by his speed.  Misjudge his rhythm even slightly and it’s this heart that would be skewered through.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Right.  Cool and calm, then.  Keep the course.  Watch the siblings.  Seize the chance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But as though to harry the very effort, attacking my ears again were the ghastly gusts—a third twister thundering in, likely to persuade out of me another side-escape.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so I played along.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Holding the <i>svǫrtaskan</i> low, I leapt clear aside—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—and in the act, brandished the blackblade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hgh—!?”</i>  Surprise flashed on Theodor’s face as he appeared right in the path of the sword-swing.  Sensing success in that instant, I drave the dragonseared blade ever forth to fell the Östberg brother.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But then—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—ffvvwoohh!!—</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—blasting in was the fourth storm.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　∵　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">No!  The winds—wielded again <i>too soon!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Surprise was now mine to savour; escaping here required sacrifice.  But there was nothing for it: reining in my every sinew, I stopped the soot-steel from finding Theodor’s flesh.  All fighting form broken, I then threw myself away from the twister’s warpath.  Like a thousand whips, its currents licked and lashed as it blasted through, battering my body with the shockwaves wuthering in its wake.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Grit and gravel rained as I tumbled to a halt.  Left bent on a knee, I glanced back, discovering a long gash hollowing the ground where I’d been set to seal Theodor’s fate.  But amidst the aftermath was the man himself nowhere to be seen.  Struck by his absence, I leapt away once more and re-steeled myself for any coming surprise.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This was a foul turn.  Never had I imagined Viola capable of <i>volleying</i> so monstrous a magick.  “Sacrifice” indeed; had I tarried to fell Theodor, most surely would I have shared his grave.  The thought alone wrung a cold sweat out of my back.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Sorry, Sis.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There yonder: Theodor’s voice as he appeared not in another ambush, but several paces from his sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“All well and fine,” Viola answered with softness.  “My storm is your shield, Theodor.  Not on my watch will that sword of his seam your skin.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That, I’ll not doubt,” her brother nodded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">More than ever did it cut clear: trussing these two was trust unshakable.  Aught less would’ve made such coordinated combat an impossibility.  The spearmanship of the Östberg siblings; far indeed did its fame ring throughout the realm, and not with any hollowness, either.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola’s voice sounded again, wintry now to its former, sisterly warmth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You’re looking more the haggard hog, Rolf Buckmann.  Lo, how your sweat shimmers,” she observed, bearing her spear as a hunter does afore a quailing quarry.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What, this?” I said, aware again of my fatigue.  “What man wouldn’t swelter?  To see so fair a fox as yourself?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What man would dare so deftless a line?” she quipped, cold and undaunted.  “Do try not too hard, cherry boy.  Your gloze is glass.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A stinging retort.  And piercing withal in its truth: that line of mine was, in fact, a gamble of a gloze, a mask for my flagging mettle.  Rolf the “haggard hog”, for certain, one wasted and wounded before even chancing this battle, no less.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But what of it?  This was no spar, no display afore feasting princes and their fawning courtiers.  A war this was; to hie into the fields of fighting yet full-hale is itself the seldom scenario.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘Even should blade and bow be broken both, abandon not the stroke of hope.’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such was writ in the martial manuals.  And as “hope” would have it, here in my hands was the soot-steel—a blade not to be broken.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yes.  There was <i>hope</i> yet.  But one to be wielded at haste, for to this moment were the braves of Hensen embroiled in battle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Here, then.  Here must my idle complaints end and the curtain call begin; another second’s delay dooms one more comrade to the coffin.  If my strength is as a waning flame, then let it feed upon a new fuel: my very soul.  Only then can I cut these commanders down, and hew from them the dusk to this dire struggle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hhaa…”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I exhaled; hot-headedness now would sooner find <i>me</i> hewn, instead.  Thus I cooled my nerves amidst my full-kindled spirit, that I might better scry the thread so key in solving this skein.  And in so doing, I found in that moment a flicker yet in my heart.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Up from the fathoms it flitted.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Then to my lips it lilted.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And through the air it fluttered, bearing a name well-known to my ears… and a red memory to my sword.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Felicia,” I uttered at last.  “&#8230;A handful she must’ve been, that sister of mine.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Ah.  That’s right,” Viola almost sang.  “So, had her wish fulfilled, has she, that Felicia?  How heartwarming.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>…What?</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola’s words.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Had I heard them awrong?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Or had Viola indeed aired something most amiss?  <i>Silly,</i> even?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And yet here her brother stands, defiant to his plight… and deaf to her pleas, I should imagine,” the elder Östberg continued.  “Tell me.  Whatever happened to that poor girl?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…”Whatever happened”?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Was Viola truly dim to what had transpired between Felicia and myself?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Was such a thing <i>possible?</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Östberg siblings; high upon the watchtower were they perched, all through the course of the day’s battle.  How, then, could they not’ve gleaned so fraught a familial fray, if even for a moment?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Nay.  The possibility was there, that our duel had been but a wood in the forest; however broad the Östbergs’ view of this great battle might’ve been, it rattled reason to expect even their eagle eyes to find every fight.  Indeed, such was the sheer chaos that was now flooding through the camp.  A chaos that had demanded their full mind in commanding their dying men.  But was it demanding enough?  <i>Distracting</i> enough?  To have cast wax over their eyes and ears for any sight or sound of the Buckmanns’ war-like bickering?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yes…  Thinking on it, Felicia and I had not fought for very long.  No, not at all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Our combat had escaped their ken—of this, more and more was I convinced.  Or was convincing me in and of itself a card in their cunning hand?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This I could not scry.  Clouds hung now over my own ken.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Mired in rumination within, I thought then to look without.  To wit: at Viola.  The meaning in her mien, the inquisitive quivering in her eyes, the rhythm in her respiration—at all of these I peered…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…and could espy from none the swindler’s port.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Only one way to find out for certain, then.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Steeling my sinews and bracing my bosom, I…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What matter now, my renegade?” she called, cocking her face slightly.  “A muted mouth ill-makes a man more the charmer, you ought kno—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Once again were Viola’s words severed.  But not by her own will: straight to her I shot, shouldering the soot-steel full-brazen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;hh!?”</i>  For an instant, her countenance cracked with confusion.  My sudden offence seemed a fright upon her foresight—and a suicidal move to all eyes beholding, a prey hurrying into the hunter’s snare.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so down the irons bit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hhyah!!”</i>  Viola was a mercenary vaunted to high heaven.  Never could she be taken aback for too long, nor deceived to much success.  And so with all swiftness did her ensorcelled spear spring forth, unfettering the fifth storm in this fight.  Billowing and bellowing, the bewitched winds whirled wildly my way.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not once.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not in the gate-breeching battle of yesternight.  Not in the camp-capturing combat on this day.  Not once had I sundered a spell, save all that Felicia had brought to bear against me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not once.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sigmund and Ulrik, too, had I fought, sure.  The swordsman’s cheek, the halberdier&#8217;s bosom—their flesh I’d severed unstopped by the palings protecting them.  But piercing palings was a common sight.  Unmaking magicks?  Not so.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Östbergs, then, knew not what fangs this wolf hid.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Straight unto me stampeded the tempest, a whirlwind to whelm the wits and grind to mince any man it devoured, flesh, bone, and all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But I fled not.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Charging ever forth unto Death’s storm, I raised the weight of the wolfsteel off my shoulders, and from on high, heaved it down full-stroke.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Fwghohh!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A sound of finality—the sole remains of the maelstrom as it settled instantly unto silence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At such a sight, Östberg eyes widened.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The gamble of a guess proved a profit.  Never had Viola taken my foolhardy charge to be aught more than just that.  Never had she thought it in my power to still her storm.  That such an act, of killing spells with but a cut of the sword, could beckon much bewilderment from a foe… such was the lifesaving lesson from my own sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Indeed, it was bewilderment that now manacled the Östbergs in place.  But only for the barest mite of a moment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That’s right.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A mite of a moment, not much more than a blink.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet in that blink were they arrantly defenceless.  A blink I did not let escape.  Baffle their minds, unmake them in the while: the sword of surprise, swung to success… along with the soot-steel, as it arrived upon Viola’s midst.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Blackness flashed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Through my hands ran the rattle of mortality.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Of a blade burrowing through flesh.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　∵　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Blood leapt out of Viola’s bosom.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To the ground she buckled, her knees striking the red-dappled dirt.  And in that moment, a bare, quiet moment, she turned to her brother.  There, a look was shared between them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Th… dor… I… I’m…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Quivering, quieting words, last upon the lips of Viola Östberg.  Strength failing, she fell full upon the earth, limp fingers freeing her windless weapon.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>…Ssheeeng!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Shooting in was another spearhead, set to stab me through.  Twisting out of its way, I bounded clear back and took post far from its vengeful wielder.  No follow-up came in pursuit.  I soon understood why: his spear was less to pierce me dead, and more to remove me from his sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">When next I saw him, Theodor was hunched over her unbreathing body.  On and on he stared at her, blank and speechless.  Yet no matter how long he looked, what was once shared a moment ago was now forever a memory.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hgh…”</i> he grimaced, face graven with grief.  A grief that then grew into a wild, wailing anger. <i>“&#8230;Nghaaa────ah!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Khsangh!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sword and spear clashed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Theodor appeared right afore my eyes, bearing down might and main upon the blade that had so savoured his sister’s blood.  His face flashed wroth; pure spite was what had sped him unto me in the single blink.  But driving away the joust, I dared an offence in turn.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Khakhr!  Khshanh!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Metals struck, shrill and shrieking.  Sparks spat, bright and braying.  Over and again, weapons pouncing and parrying.  Along its course was Theodor’s skill on full and frenetic display, so much so that a lesser eye might’ve measured him not a master, but a man driven mad with misery.  To mine, however, such could not be farther from the truth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ten trades, twenty—a crescendo of checks and challenges, the end whereof found us both famished for air.  Breaking away in tandem, we then stared each other down, stealing glances here and there to survey again the span between us, all the while catching our breaths with due caution.  I had much confidence in what my lungs could endure, reckoning them a summit above Theodor’s.  Yet with magicks was the spearman’s body bolstered, and so did the fight find us, heretic and hireling, equal in at least that respect.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hhah… haahh…”</i> Theodor breathed as laboriously as I, brimming at the eyes with vengeance.  And yet…  “&#8230;A gamble,” he soon said.  “That’s all battle is.  A gamble wagering the greatest stakes.  A gamble you’ve won… against my sister.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Foeship poisons.  Fury imprisons,” he went on, cuttingly quiet.  “Not on the battlefield do vices as these avail.  This, my beloved Viola has oft said.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In uttering the name of his dearly departed, the bereaved brother bit his teeth with such force that all his face began to shudder.  His hands, as well; gloved and gauntleted though they were, a glance could well-glean just how bitterly they wrung at his readied spear.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;And yet!!” he cried, sudden as a lash of lightning.  “How my veins <i>swell</i> with venom!!  How my heart <i>howls</i> behind its bars!!  Never to know solace till <i>yours</i> is run full-through, <i>Rolf Buckmann!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Against such ire, my brows fell.  “I know…” I said.  “&#8230;I know.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Emotions erupting from within; a bosom thundering and throbbing so, that unbearable becomes the urge to scratch and rake away at it, flesh and feelings all, just for some semblance of solace—this, I’ve never lived for myself.  But in living upon the battlefield did I come to know the existence of such a scouring experience—and the terrible toll it exacts.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;You?”</i> Theodor hissed, shaking his head.  “You know <i>nothing!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A seething accusation followed by a fierce lunge.  Afire was the fray once more.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘You know nothing.’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The words cried deep into my core.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Indeed, never had I lost a loved one who so shared my blood.  Why, I’d even made the very decision <i>to</i> lose them.  Someday, somewhere—by my own hands, no less.  Should needs demand it.  Should the fates see it fit.  Who am I, then, to <i>know</i> aught?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But I do know.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Of those that have suffered such loss as his.  Of those that struggle on, day after day, despite the pain.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I do know.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I <i>have</i> to know.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For another choice was made: to walk alongside them and give mind to all their grief.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so, Theodor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I <i>know.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Dyahh!!”</i> spiritedly sprang my cry as I brandished the black sword in kind.  There did blade and point bite and peal, each dread-driven, each seeking to prove the worthier pain.  The crack and crackle of combat, conducted once more to the horror of the very air as it shuddered at our every strike.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Some witchery you wield, is it!?” Theodor screamed amidst his masterful spearmanship.  “That so damns the odyl of my spear!?  That so stilled my sister’s storm!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In want of some warrant for his guess, the Östberg brother’s eyes stabbed and studied my ensuing expression.  A vain effort, for surely he knew how near he was to the mark; he had wits enough for it, as attested by the feats he’d shown me thus far.  Or perhaps it was merely that he wished to hear the confession from the criminal’s lips.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A gift, then!  For the ungraced!” he shouted on.  “Your <i>Inquisition!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A fey absence followed—the odyl girding his spear was now gone altogether.  In its stead was a twice-cruel increase elsewhere: the further quickening of his offence and the infuriation of his strength.  No doubt there was, then…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hwoo──oaahh!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…that every dew of odyl was now devoted wholly to bolstering his flesh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Howling, Theodor battled anew with bedevilled desperation, his spear hacking and hasting more ravenously than ever before.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I fought back, barely keeping afloat above my surprise for my foe’s choice, a clear challenge to all conventions of combat as it was.  Indeed, the weapon was what deserved odyl, not solely the sinews, lest the blade fail against a paling and punishment be meted in turn; a misery my own flesh recalled much too well.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All told, neither was I the conventional foe, nor this sword of soot a mundane threat.  Theodor perhaps chose aright, then.  If his spear-odyl should die against every touch of the <i>svǫrtaskan,</i> then better to bolster his body with the magicked might, and seek the killing strike all the more surely.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still, to be so inspired to play so wayward a hand in the heat of battle…  Certainly no easy feat, that.  But such was the deed plainly on display.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Heaaa───ahh!!”</i>  Louder still clapped his cries.  More rapidly again lashed and lunged his snake-like spear.  Overvied and overwhelmed, it was only a matter of time before my own blood should stain the scene.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ghegh!”</i> I groaned as a graze gushed and shot across my shoulder.  Between my own sword and my own sinews, I lost not in a contest of might.  Indeed, a single blow of mine ought overpower any that Theodor himself could produce, body-emboldened or no.  The rub rested in his rapidity: his spear was now striking sooner than I could answer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But not only that.  Hardly was he led about by such helter-skelter haste, as a master is overwhelmed by his unwieldy beast.  No, Theodor was no meek master.  With skill seldom seen was he reigning in his unruly speed to perfection, yielding a performance that matched most mete with his style of spearmanship.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Dwelling in defence here would earn me my doom.  And so, readied against risk—<i>”Hhyet!!”</i>—I lurched and wrought forth a sweep of my blade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Ghsseengh!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A line of sparks spouted.  The tip of the dragon-tempered sword sang—having but shallowly sheared across Theodor’s cuirass.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No good.  Too long was the length between us.  A gap of half a pace protected him more surely than any armour could.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hateful hound!  You hunger for more…!?” Theodor rasped as he recoiled.  “Then you have it!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">From view he faded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Right afore my eyes, a vanishing like a jester’s trick.  Though not for long: far off he appeared again.  But another instant found his spearpoint speeding to my throat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Egh!?”</i> I gasped, guarding straightway against Theodor’s thunderflash offence before returning in kind a centrewise cut.   But the blackblade bit naught, its too-nimble mark already in retreat to an unchallengeable distance.  “What speed…!” I huffed, taken aback.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Theodor Östberg.  Above all whom I’d made battle against, in all the years of my life, did he stand as the speediest—above even Lise herself.  This was grim.  Were he to commit to this tactic, of hitting and running with the agility of living levin, then his victory seemed all but certain.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hyaaagh!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ghegh!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And commit he did.  Over and again, Theodor thundered in with a blurring thrust, only to then escape clear from the crime.  The cruel continuation carved wound after wound out of me, each of which I’d only managed to avert from my vitals with a dogged defence.  But, thoroughly thrashed as I was, not for much longer could I overlook my mounting loss of blood.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet the situation persisted, one so dire and deathly that even a simple blink of the eyes engendered much danger.  Here and there darted my vision.  Here and there dashed in his spear.  A repetition of barely gleaning and barely guarding, my very life put on the line with every move.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“This wolf yet keeps his wits whetted…” Theodor hissed amidst a new lull in his lunges.  “Rolf Buckmann!  You’ve hid your fangs all too well!”  From yonder he glowered, his face shadowed with a new shame.  “Never have I feigned blindness for them.  Never have I weighed your war-worth any lesser than its due.  But now I see the veil masking my eyes!  The deception skewing my scale…!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Frayed with frustration, my foe clenched teeth and spear alike.  His anger for his ungraced foe remained aglow as ever, but hounding him now, too, was anger for himself.  Perhaps for making too light of this prey… only to pay the too-heavy price of his sister’s life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Likewise, Theodor,” I answered, haggard and hoarse.  “Over-bright was your sister’s shine… to have so enshadowed the superior strength in her own brother—I ought’ve felled you first when I had the chance.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola was whom I’d thought the deadlier threat.  A thought earning now none of my thanks.  No, it wasn’t Viola, but her own brother, Theodor Östberg, who rightfully held claim as the most affrighting beast upon this battlefield.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　∵　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;A strength,” Theodor reflected, “superior to Sister’s?  As I am now?”  Together his lips pressed, as though to some pain.  “&#8230;A beloved, lost.  A strength, gained.  This wound <i>wails,</i> Rolf Buckmann, when in so reckoning, you rub into it the salt of irony!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What irony, Theodor Östberg?” I returned.  “That only torn from Viola could you attain to your potential?  Or that you ill-see your soaring strength for what it truly is—a fitting sendoff for your dear sister?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola’s creed had walked in lockstep with the cruelty that was Londosian canon.  Why, she’d sacrifice a Nafílim child if it furthered her fortunes.  And for that, I could feign no fellowship with her.  For that, she full-deserved her defeat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still, to label her as little more than an enemy, some mere hurdle to be hewn, would’ve been blithe of me, or baleful, even.  As I ought bear the blade of resolve in my hands, so I ought make of my eyes the clear mirrors of measure, that I might judge my enemy justly, and even vouch for any valour he has revealed.  Lest I in turn fashion myself a foe deserving every profanity spat at me.  Lest I lose my way and betray, too, the people to whom I’ve made my promises.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so do I look to Viola Östberg, and see the faceted soul that she was: a callous sellsword, a capable commander… and a caring sister with true cherishment for her brother.  For what else accounts her last words?  Her last thoughts for Theodor?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;I… I’m…’</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…”sorry”.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For leaving too soon.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For living no longer by your side.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Till the bitter end did this sister worry for her brother.  Then so should his newfound strength well-lay her worries to rest.  Theodor, now strong upon his own two feet, stronger than even his loving sister—indeed, what better keepsake for her parting spirit?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Unbroken was that quieted brother’s stare upon me, with eyes distant, with ears yet ringing with my words.  In his mien was enmity, of course.  But something else, as well.  Something, misting in and out of sight.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;‘Look ill beyond the ungraced label’&#8230;” he seemed to recite.  “&#8230;Always the fool that falls for his own folly…”  Such introspection earned my puzzlement.  But that moment soon ended as keenness glinted again in Theodor’s regard and a thunder returned to the air: that of his voice.  “Enough!  It’s high time I bled you dry, Rolf Buckmann!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thus resumed his lightning-flash offence, flickering in and out of reach, striking as he pleased, leaping away from any retaliation of my trying, only to lunge back in for another bite.  Against such fury, I could but defend desperately and more desperately still.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Gghh…!”</i> I groaned with grinding teeth, drowning again in this sea of chanceless exchanges, of dodging Death time and again by mere slices of a second.  Would that Theodor’s spear were slower by even a mite, then most certainly could I have answered it in full.  But that selfsame mite of a difference gave the Östberg brother all the advantage he needed: over and on were dealt grazes and gashes upon my person, with none given in kind to the offender.  Diverting odyl from his spear to his sinews, then, had proven to my opponent the champion’s choice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Bshhrr!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Across my thigh opened a slit most straight, drawn by Theodor’s low-lunging thrust.  From it flew fresh blood.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How deeply I desired to endure it all, that I might glean some gap in his rhythm and mount a timely counter.  But at this rate, defeat by futility seemed my singular fate.  Had I some way to strike my foe from a distance, if only to check or distract him… yet my only means here was held in my very hands: a sword.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A furrow twitched upon my brow.  This was the exact same situation when I’d faced Felicia: unceasingly assailed from a distance, with no sword-swing of mine ever reaching its mark.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Hold there.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Surely I’ve gained something from her, from fending off those fey spells of hers.  Indeed this must be so.  As Theodor himself had moulded his mettle to vie with mine, so should I assay the same.  To vie with him… must I vie with myself.  <i>My yesterself.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To moult into a mightier man must Rolf of today triumph over himself of yesterday.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But needed for that feat were the boons of today’s battles.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Then, I remembered it.  A spark in the dark.  Felicia’s final offence: the Igniēns Ĭcendō.  The dart of death, the surestriking shot—sundered by a swing of this soot-steel.  If even <i>that</i> could be cut, then Theodor himself ought fall to the same sword.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I had but to recall the moment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">When Felicia’s blood-black levin collected.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">When that blistering line then lunged forth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Against it, I…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…At once, I eased my every sinew.  A taut string sooner snaps; in looseness, too, lives power.  A tenet of the sword; a lesson I’d long left half-learnt.  But aface Felicia had I felt closer to its secrets than ever before.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Untangle all tenseness.  Empty all exertion.  Cast from the conscience the boundary between flesh and atmosphere.  Meld the mind with the ambiance about.  Envision flesh as water, free and flowing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Be as Nought.  Sense the instant to strike.  And as it comes, let Nought become Numberless.  There shall prodigious strength and speed be born.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This all, I ventured.  Voided of vigour and unfettered from faculties, I then sought Theodor’s flickering form, waiting, waiting, waiting for the moment of his arrival, for when the very shimmer in his eyes could be seen with all clarity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And when that moment came, I flooded my body full with brunt, and brandished forth the lightless blade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ssyah!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sword and spear instantly intersected.  Two blades blazing trails, a contest to sooner scythe the other’s master.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Zzkkhrr!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The sound and sensation of rupturing flesh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ghhh…!”</i> came a rasping groan…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…from whose throat but mine.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Naught but air did the soot-steel savour, whilst given to Theodor’s spear was a feast of ungraced flesh, ripped fresh from my flank.  Still, not yet was my life forfeit, a fact perhaps espied by the Östberg brother, as rather than wreak the mercy stroke, he once again retreated and stared me down from a distance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A close one, cur!” Theodor cried in concession.  “Full-maimed might I’ve been right then and there, had some prior wound of yours not stayed that sword!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">An eagle-eyed estimation.  Indeed was I yet harried by the hid wounds from Felicia’s Kōkūtós, enough that any deftness dared by my sword seemed a dullness.  But such was too poor an excuse—it was my <i>guess</i> that had failed me, and made of my sword a fool’s swing.  Theodor’s was a thinking mind, not some insentient magick, loosed upon a mark like some fevered foxhound—even if such magick were mighty as Felicia’s Igniēns Ĭcendō.  Answering his spear as I did my sister’s spells, then, was a blunder from the beginning.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You really are too perilous a prey,” my foe hissed.  “Not till your beheading can this huntsman breathe in peace!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Pouncing, Theodor began once again his gashing and gouging rampage.  And true to his word, my death by a thousand cuts seemed his most desired design.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Kh… ghuh!”</i>  On and on I struggled, blood and sparks spitting every which way with each exchange.  Little by little, Theodor’s lancing lunges whittled away at my flesh.  Most miserable amongst them was the wound through my side as it gushed with greater crimson.  At such a rate, my collapse loomed nigh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet there was hope, one hid from Theodor with all stealth—step by step had I been sidling up to a certain spot, all the while warding off the speeding spears with as best a play at desperation as I could feign.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Soon!  Soon!” Theodor almost seemed to sing.  “You’ll see it soon enough!  Your <i>ender’s end,</i> Sis!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It was right anear that very same sister of his where I next arrived.  This was it.  My second scheme.  As fancied before: a means to strike my foe from afar.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hha—ah!”</i> roared Theodor, returning fleetly for another joust.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Foreseeing his approach, I kicked up Viola’s weapon from the ground and, catching it in one hand, reared myself back to readiness—for a last resort of a spear-throw.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How utterly leaden it felt in my fingers.  Certainly not a thing to be thrown, this.  But neither was the sword of soot a thing to be swung.  Yet if even <i>that</i> could I master, then—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Sseh!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Full-fast flew the Zaharte spear.  Only, where it went was not the body of its late wielder’s brother, but only his feet.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In other words: exactly as aimed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Nngh!?”</i>  Startled, Theodor jerked and jumped to escape my schemed attack.  But such was his momentum that the mere jump became a long and shallow leap—and a prison besides.  Airborne, no longer could he correct either course or career.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Taking the opportunity, I bolted forth and heaved the blackblade in an overhead slash.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Zzyaa—ah!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Fine soot misted, trailing the sailing steel.  Thereafter shrieked shorn armour and flesh—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—the sound of Theodor sundered in his flight.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　∵　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Onward he arced through the air, his limbs limp as he went.  Neither grace nor glory found him at his landing; slamming into the ground, Theodor’s body thudded air and earth both like a dying thunderbolt.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Further on he tumbled, a violent brushstroke drawing across the dirt a long streak of red, till at last, he stopped.  Wisps of dust dangled in his wake.  A lull fell.  Yet the feeling lingered.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In my fingers.  In my arms.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The sensation of having severed flesh.  Of cutting bone.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Of landing the lethal blow.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Certain, I then set my eyes upon him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There Theodor laid, like a thing crushed thin.  Moments passed.  Distant battle rumbled.  Blood seeped in silence.  By the end, his hands finally flinched.  His body followed, quietly, quiveringly dragging itself back to its feet.  With frightful effort, he turned my way, revealing a wound I dare not describe.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At me he stared.  Through a face steeped in sanguine soil, he stared.  Without a word.  Without a stir.  I returned the look, equally quiet, never leaving his eyes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A muffled thump next murmured.  Dust sprang again.  His spear had fallen.  The proud polearm, caked crimson with ungraced blood, now freed from its master’s fingers.  Then did that same master begin to move.  A slow and shivering shamble, step after unsteady step, each made with the last of his strength.  I but watched on, silent still.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He seemed in approach towards me, eyes intent upon mine as they were.  But I knew better.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For betwixt us laid Viola.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nearer and nearer still he came, hauling his feet across the blood-damp dirt.  Only, at a few strides from his sister, his legs failed, and to the ground he foundered.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But before long, up from the dust rose his face.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And straining, striving, his arms further assayed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To crawl closer to his cold sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I dared not lend him aid.  This was his moment.  <i>Their</i> moment.  <i>Their</i> world.  Theirs, and theirs alone, never to suffer any other soul—not least one who had wrought upon them this very fate.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In time, Theodor gained Viola, and there clambered up to her side.  Then, taking her hand, his fingers caressed and curled about hers.  His other hand reached around her nape, and bringing her close…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…the brother embraced his dead sister.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Theodor’s eyes then faded to a close.  I felt next the last of his life lifting into the air, and in that still and sighing expanse, dissipating from all perception.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To depart to paths unknown.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And join again his beloved sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Alone, I left my eyes to linger upon the two, entwined as they were, and pondered them.  Their lives, their lot—none of which I knew, and could scarce guess.  Only one thing was certain, and in fixing upon it, a rosey-red thought then glimmered in my mind.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A maiden of deep-ruby eyes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My one and only sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…With whom on this day I did not embrace, but battled to a bitter end.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Östberg siblings.  Foes felled, but never to be forgotten.  Not as they were afore me, fast in each other’s touch.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Long must they have braved this too-wicked world—together.  A mountainous struggle, mildened only by the strength and solace of their sibling bond.  A warmth shared till the ultimate cold.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Aface their enfolded forms as I was, I suffered then a spear of another sort, one stabbing clear through my bosom and moving my lips to a whisper.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Begotten by the same belly… sharing the same days… only to…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I closed my eyes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Behind the half-lit lids, I saw her again.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The face of my fair Felicia.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There did she look back, yet not with any gladness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But a gaze of many tears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Theodor.  Viola.  This victory… it is yours,” I uttered, “&#8230;more than you shall ever know.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Triumph.  Tragedy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Wagers won.  Lives lost.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sweetly was never savoured the wine celebrating the bitter victory.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such was the scar left upon my conscience.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For what seemed too long did we make battle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felling Men, being felled in turn—on and on, the fires burnt and our hale seemed soon to flag.  Yet still we strove and kept lit the torch of purpose, for there was anticipation amongst our number: a victory, near at hand.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yes, victory—our aim here at Arbel.  The day promised it to us, and with all care had we made plans, that it might be pleased and make good on it.  But the long struggle mayhaps has muddied my eyes, as when this scene afore me unfolded, it seemed more a dream than aught.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A scene of Men halting and quelling.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A scene of their sudden surrender.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Fräulein…” called a brave of mine, “&#8230;could it be…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Wide-eyed, I let drop my wearied hands.  “It… it could,” I stammered out an answer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So ‘twas no dream at all, or otherwise one shared by my comrades all: looking about, I found them each dazed with disbelief for this new silence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">After Ulrik, that ogre of a Man, had perished, we fought on to great advantage.  Yet even then the Fiefguard’s mettle held strong: dogged and more dogged still the Men resisted, as though death were a sweeter end than defeat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">We had thought then that foul winds were soon to blow upon this pitched battle, that a wasting and wasteful strife would be ours to wage.  But the thought was sooner allayed.  What we had next gleaned was a queerness amongst our enemies: orders running through their ranks, meeting stunned ears.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>Click-click.  Clank-clank.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Now resounded many Mennish swords and spears, all of them clamouring to the earth.  Some of their wielders fell with them—to the knees, anguished and lost.  Peering up were some others, searching the clouds for some never-coming answer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To my comrades, ‘twas clear then: the Fiefguard were defeated, having cast their arms and chosen surrender.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Word was sent to them,” another brave wondered aloud.  “But what…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Word of their masters’ fall, mayhaps?” I guessed, as in my mind was lit an image of another Man.  “He’s done it…” I said, “&#8230;Rolf has slain the Östbergs…!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No other course could there be.  Dead was their lord; this we knew.  Yielding here, then, meant but one thing: the commanders of Zaharte were no more.  And with them, the Fiefguard’s will for war and the fastness of Arbel both.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Long have we Vílungen vied with the House of Ström for this land of our breeding.  A great many battles, waged by my father, his predecessor, and more uncounted jarlar there on.  Such has it ever been.  Such shall it ever be.  This we had always thought.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But even over so enduring a stage could fall the proverbial curtains.  And drawing them were not the hands of one of ours… but a <i>Man’s.</i>  So asudden had he appeared in our midst.  So keen had he guided our blades through this battle.  So decisive did he end in days what generations could not.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That’s not to say the war was won.  Vast and dark yet loomed the shadow of Londosius; ‘twas only a patch of it that we had managed to illumine as our own.  And for what end but some peace of mind for our long-suffering brethren—one that might endure for a fleeting moment, as from far yonder was doubtless the march of Londosius’ answer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">We had to muster our own, and swift.  Every effort, every thought bent to this single enterprise, if with any dearness did we long for a lasting victory and silence to this war.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…A “silence to this war”.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Till not a week ago had I believed such a thing possible.  But now in my bosom was hope, small but brave against the shadow.  A candle enkindled…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Londosius shall fall…’</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…by these very words, uttered resolute from whose mouth but that beacon of a Man.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hh… khh…!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Beside me so wept a fellow brave.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Nay.  ‘Twas not just he.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">We were all of us moved to tears.  Sniffling, snivelling above smiles and frowns both.  Recalling our dear lost.  Glad for our friends and family yet alive.  For alive would they remain.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yes…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Alive.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Why, we ought rejoice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">From tomorrow and on would the battles endure, true, but for today…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…today, we can rejoice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For we have won.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　∵　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;uu… hic… auu…”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Crying.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Up on a great, big beech tree, I cry and cry.  Further and further up is my handkerchief, a white and pretty little thing.  My very favourite, but now ‘tis stuck on a twig behind many, many leaves.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A blow of the wind has whisked it there, and I thought to go after it.  And so after it I’ve went, up and up the sky-high tree.  But a look down along the way has left me dizzied and scared too asudden and too much to move a mite further.  And so have I stayed sat upon a big, beechen bough, clinging to the trunk and crying on and on.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;aau… hic… hhau…”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I’m frozen where I am.  I can’t climb, nor come back down.  I can’t even stand to look anywhere below.  But the sun is setting; night is nearing.  What am I to do…?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I’m scared.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Oh so scared.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so very alone.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So very, very…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…I…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…I hear someone.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Just as my tears are beginning to tire, my ears take in a voice from far below.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The same voice I’ve been wishing and wanting to hear.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Don’t cry, Felicia,” the boy below says.  “I’m here for you now.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Up and up the trunk he flies, the bearer of that voice, swift and sure as a squirrel.  Soon enough, he’s beside me, patting my pate and casting a quiet smile.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Be good and wait here,” he says, calm and secure.  “I’ll be right back with your handkerchief.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Then, reaching aloft, he lifts himself up to a higher bough and climbs through the canopy.  Keeping watch, I spot him easily plucking the handkerchief free, and before long, he’s back by my side.  With the cloth returned, he then softly caresses my crown.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How big and warm, his hand.  A touch of sunlight, just as always.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A mere year apart we are.  But he’s to me a guardian angel—just as always.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so about my angel I throw my arms and embrace him as tightly as I can.  All the fear, all the loneliness then seem to fly away.  Far, far away.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Brother…!  Oh, Brother…!” I cry into his breast.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Now, now,” he says softly.  “No more worrying.  You did well.  All’s fine now.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I’m… I’m sorry, Brother,” I snivel.  “The wind blew, and… and…!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But with the fear gone, I find myself flushing from shyness and shame.  The little lady of a lord’s house, climbing a tree?  A silly story.  Yet ‘twasn’t so silly to have got trapped on high, to have troubled my dear brother with yet another chore.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I weave one excuse after another, making little sense or none at all.  But, smiling, Brother heeds them all till the end, before bidding me thus:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Felicia,” he says.  “Look there.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yonder where his eyes stare, framed and festooned by the trees of our wood, is a portrait of ridges, high and far in the horizon.  There the sun is sat, half-aslumber above the hills.  The rays shimmering through the limbs and leaves, the skies blushing between glow and gloam—a world as rich and warm as the oranges we enjoyed last summer.  Taking in the picture book vista, I can’t help but be left in wordless wonder.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Today’s treat—and the treasure at the end of our little adventure,” so says my brother, caressing my head again.  “Thank you, Felicia.  It’s a fine place you’ve found.  But next time, don’t go it alone, you hear?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yes… dear Brother,” I answer, squinting ticklishly and relishing in his touch.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My Brother, ever and always there to protect me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ever and always there to save me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My beloved Brother.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">..</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">..</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…My eyes lifted open.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas quiet.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Water whispered.  Creatures chirped.  The sunken sun sighed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I was lying amidst grass and gravel.  Anear ran a river.  Above spanned a bridge.  About slumbered the city.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twould seem I had been sleeping fast… or had fallen afaint.  I knew not for certain, only, ‘twas likely that—spent of all odyl, forworn by many woes… and broken from battle—I had failed and for hours was passed from all thought.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Battle…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yes.  I had fled from battle.  Fled from the concentration camp.  Fled to these outskirts under cover of commotion—namely, the wretched retreat of the Zaharte remnants, their lives each owed to the mercy of the Nafílim victors.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The battle was lost, then.  A battle wherein my hard-learnt and years-honed spells were severed and silenced.  A battle wherein I was foiled at every effort, brought to the very last brink, and made to bleed… by Brother’s own blade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I sat still under the stonework, hid from all sight, reminiscing on the misery that came before…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…and there, remembered the dream.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A nostalgic dream.  A dream of when Brother was yet strong and sheltered under his wings his little sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Today, too, was he strong.  Though I scarce thought him so at the start.  Why, I’d even belittled him, slighted him sore, and boasted brazenly of how my mettle stood a mountain over his.  But amidst the battle did the mists part, and there was revealed his higher summits.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How handily he had defeated me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And how strongly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That such strength was in him, I never knew.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That ever and always had it remained in him, fast and unfaded… never had I known.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But now was his path parted from ours, from Emilie’s and mine, that never again would he suffer us by his side.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nay…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas winters ago that our parts had parted.  But now did they intertwine once more…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Nay, Felicia…<br />
We must forge ahead…<br />
We must fight…</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>We’re foes, now…<br />
You and I…!’</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;hh…”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Crying.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet again was I crying.  Down my cheeks trickled bitter warmth.  From my voice trickled broken sobs.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;aah… hic… auu…”</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Why?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Why will you not stay by our side?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Was pushing you away once…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…any reason to push us away forever?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Is that the way of it?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Then…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…then what of it…!?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What matter!?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">We’re family, after all!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">You and I!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My brother…!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My dear, dear Brother!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;au… hic… aau…”</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">On and on, I cried and cried.  But no matter how many tears I shed, never did Brother come to wipe them away.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Through the concentration camp I walked.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Evenlight was fallen.  From noon till gloam had we fought, and only now was the battle full-silenced.  Gone were the screams and roars, the clamour of weapons and armour.  Filling the vesper instead was another commotion: from here, there, everywhere, much cheer and merriment was made, that we might’ve seemed fete-goers were this any other day.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A gentle chill fluttered through the air, but little it did to cool the glow of victory.  Tidings, too, of the captives’ rescue were soon broken to us all.  Twenty and more, safe and sound—what a gladness to our ears, that happy and happier still danced our long-forgotten joy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hurra, Fräulein!  Hurra!” rejoiced a brave, his face ashine with tears.  “It is done!  The day is ours!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Tis indeed,” I answered him.  “Thank you.  And thank you all!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">On and on, many more alike to him offered me their mirth and humour as they revelled and frolicked in each other&#8217;s arms.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A victory.  A fruitful, sore-deserved victory.  One that the chroniclers would be no less teary-eyed in documenting, as they sit and struggle to put to words what we participants could not: the sheer elation we felt for this momentous achievement.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That said, gaiety would come later for myself and Volker.  Much drudgery lies in wait after a battle; today was no different, and the shoulders to bear that burden were whose but ours.  To this moment was Volker making terms with the defeated; to wit, a middle commander representing the remnant Fiefguard.  And whilst that brew was simmering away, ‘twas my duty to make the rounds, verifying our casualties and dictating the mending of our wounded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Mm…  Where’s that Man gone off to?” I wondered aloud.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Searching out Rolf, too, was another duty of mine.  ‘Twas after laying the Östbergs low that he’d made his return to us.  But in such a state of injury had we found him: riddling his body were slits and gashes without number, from all of which coursed a grim sum of blood.  Most gruesome of them was his flank, gouged asunder by some evil spear.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Straightway I had him seen to by our lǣċas and barbers.  Much mending was needed, and much more rest besides.  ‘Twas only once the battle had settled that I’d thought to pay him a visit.  But arriving at the beds, I was stunned to find him absent.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">His treatment had been done with, for true, yet convalescence required respite.  This his wisdom ought know.  Whatever could he be up to, then?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas my mission to find out.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And as well…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…to indulge in a bit of bragging.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twere <i>my</i> blades that felled Ulrik, after all, the very same worm that had so wriggled out of Rolf’s grasp.  What would <i>he</i> think of it, I wonder?  If he would have the ears for it, I should like to regale him of the feat in great detail, and mayhaps tease out of him a word of praise or three.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hmm… here?  Or…?”  To the very rear of the bastille have I gone.  Turning the bend, I spotted at last his towering figure.  “Ah!  There you… are…”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/lightnovelstranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sskvol3illus09.png?resize=759%2C1079&#038;ssl=1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Silence took my words.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This… was no occasion for high voices.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Alone he stood, Rolf.  All alone against the blazing twilight, making not a stir.  Most grave were his eyes as they but stared and stared at the ground afore him.  ‘Twas slight-raised and round, that patch of earth, as if piled by spades.  But from the look of Rolf’s mien, I guessed it at once.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas a barrow.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Once a pit, but now a mound, with not a headstone to mark it.  And sleeping in droves beneath were those vain-lost to the evils of this place.  Of this, I had no doubt.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To this barrow did Rolf give his full mind.  On and on, he looked at it.  On and on, he stood as still as stone.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Hitherto have I never asked him of such, but seeing him so morose, the thought grew in me louder than ever.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That Rolf walked with no god.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That prayers were naught to him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Whether in their meaning, or their doing.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so not even could he have closed his eyes in vigil.  Not even could he recite some dirge, or lay candles for a wake.  All he could do was look upon the earth.  On and on and on.  And mayhaps speak with his heart to the silent dead.  To soothe them.  To remember them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Just as Rolf looked long upon the barrow, so did I give him long my eyes.  In all that time, his brows furrowed not a bit.  Dusk was deepened by now, and still he remained on his feet, unmoving.  The stars began to blink, painting him blue in their light.  Yet still he stared down at the barren earth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Seeing the side of his soot-stained face, I found him both tranquil and troubled as skies over a tired battlefield.  Unable to turn my eyes away from him, I felt more and more his infinite regard for the dear departed.</p>
