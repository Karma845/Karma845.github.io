<p class="calibre10">Through the quiet night, I drove my steed unimpeded.</p><p class="calibre10">The hour-sand was flowing fast, but at last I arrived at headquarters before the break of dawn.  There, I made my way back to the barracks and savoured but a scant few hours of slumber.</p><p class="calibre10">Today, the routine would start anew.  I got up, had a change of clothes, and prepared to set out for morning training, just as the half-light of the waking skies peeked through the windows.</p><p class="calibre10">The door banged.  Fierce knocks, one after the other.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf Buckmann!” came a muffled shout.  “Come out at once!”</p><p class="calibre10">Rather urgent at such an hour&mdash;who could it be?</p><p class="calibre10">I opened the door.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes&mdash;” finding three leaders, “&mdash;sirs?”</p><p class="calibre10">No familiar faces here.</p><p class="calibre10">“Buckmann, is it?” the frontmost leader glared.  “These past two days&mdash;what’ve you been up to?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Sir.  The mareschal gave me two days’ leave,” I began explaining.  What ill.  “I left for town at ereyesterday’s eventide, and returned not till the late hours of yesternight.”</p><p class="calibre10">Nothing about my escapade at the Albeck viscounty could be revealed here.  I had no other choice&mdash;spending my days off in town would be my excuse.  It was sound enough.  Members of the Order are free to do as they please upon given leave, after all.  Curfews, staying the night elsewhere&mdash;no such limitations confined them.  Thus my dallying in town should not have set off any bells.</p><p class="calibre10">The leaders exchanged looks.</p><p class="calibre10">“Come,” was their terse response.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">Following them, we wound briskly through the halls before emerging out into the open.  Before long, I was led to the stables.  Only, there was something odd about the scene here.  The early-bird stablehands were stopped in their duties.  All was quiet.</p><p class="calibre10">I looked across the stalls.</p><p class="calibre10">One of them was empty&mdash;a stall that I was very familiar with.</p><p class="calibre10">“What do your eyes tell you, ey?” one of the leaders pointed.  “The mareschal’s steed&mdash;it is <i class="calibre3">gone.</i> The same mount as your charge, none other.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yet it was here ereyesterday, when last I’d checked,” I countered.  “As I’ve said, I was not present at headquarters till my return late last night.  In that time, responsibility for the mareschal’s horse should’ve fallen to the stablehands.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Those same stablehands attest that they’ve not caught sight of the horse.  Not as of yesterdawn,” another leader said.  “What’ve you done with the horse ereyesterday?  Tell us!”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’d done just as I’ve always done on that morning.  I groomed the horse, fed it, and took it for a walk.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And then what?  Your numb wits got the better of you, did they?  You forgot to send the steed back to its stall!” a leader raised his voice, shaking his head.  “Gutter-scum ungraced!  A scarecrow makes for a better stablehand than you, it does!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay, sir.  I made certain to return the horse back to its place,” I confirmed.  “Once more did I check ere my evening departure for town&mdash;then, too, was it right here in this stall.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And we’re to believe your muddied account, eh?  The words of an addle-pated <i class="calibre3">alga.</i> Trustworthy indeed!” scoffed another leader.  They were all livid, more so than usual.  But they had good reason to be: Emilie’s steed was a most special one.  “The mareschal was bequeathed that horse by none other than <i class="calibre3">His Majesty.</i> You <i class="calibre3">know</i> where it has gone.  Tell us!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Any soul would be frayed of nerves to care after so dear a horse, ‘tis certain.  But to let it run off?  Spineless overmuch, are we!?”</p><p class="calibre10">“That steed fetches more coin than you’ll ever be worth, ungraced!  Don’t tell us you hadn’t realised even that!?”</p><p class="calibre10">They spoke true.</p><p class="calibre10">The vanished horse was one given to Emilie by the king of our land, a boon for the 5th’s successful recapture of the Godrika Minery two winters past.  The steed was invaluable indeed, and to Emilie and our entire Order both, it was an emblem of great honour.</p><p class="calibre10">It need not be said that to lose such a precious prize was a grave matter.  There was fear mixed in with the anger of the leaders before me, one of earning the displeasure of our king, all by the fault of an ungraced foolish enough to let the horse escape.</p><p class="calibre10">A heated sigh.</p><p class="calibre10">“That does it.  We speak with the mareschal,” a leader relented as he began making his way out.  “Come!”</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">A doorway.</p><p class="calibre10">Upon its face, an engraved plate.  “Chamber of the Dame Mareschal,” it read.  And past the door was I, standing before Emilie as she was sat at the command desk.  Flanking her were the three executive officers, their eyes fixed upon me in their fury.</p><p class="calibre10">“I believe I’ve heard enough,” Emilie said calmly.  “Yet Rolf has made it clear he returned my horse to its stall, did he not?”</p><p class="calibre10">“My fair Mareschal Mernesse,” one of the leaders addressed most deliberately.  “With all due respect, surely you’ve not fallen for the words of this fellow?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Not once has he failed in his office.  I see no reason to doubt him so.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Fail, madame?” another leader raised his eyebrows.  “He is a toothless ungraced, unfit for battle.  He but whiles away the days scrubbing armour and sweeping up our places.  Perhaps he is unspotted in his menial duties&mdash;but what of it?  ‘Tis neither here nor there, I’d say!”</p><p class="calibre10">“You have known him since your earliest days,” the third thought to air his mind, “that, we understand very well.  But madame&mdash;you are <i class="calibre3">Mareschal to our Order.”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Part well your private affairs from your public office, coddle not this cur-dog of an ungraced&mdash;the thinly-veiled implications of the leaders’ words.</p><p class="calibre10">It was no secret that some amongst our ranks maintained a particular misgiving: that Emilie was insufficiently impartial in her consortion with me.  Yet my eyes saw differently.  Emilie was ever fair in her interactions; it was the others that were taken with partiality in their flagrant displays of discrimination.  But of course, they thought otherwise.</p><p class="calibre10">The doubts they harboured for their own mareschal were heretofore unaired to any open degree, for like a fine mist before the rising sun, such unease was quick to dissipate before Emilie’s sheer charisma.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet was I always the thorn jabbing their jealous hearts, an ungraced ever by the side of their dear mareschal.  It was only a matter of time before such spite spewed forth into the open.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie was fit to be the next hero-dame.  That much they saw, and eager were they to crown her to such effect.  But the coronation, as it were, could not continue on account of who else but myself.  A disease in their flesh, a flaw in their machinations.  To enthrone Emilie, they felt the pressing need to fling me as far from her side as possible.</p><p class="calibre10">“My leaders.  Calm, please,” Emilie soothed the leaders, before turning to me.  “Rolf.  Might I hear from you of your whereabouts over these last two days?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Aye, Mareschal,” answered I.  “Verily was I told to take rest from my duties by none other than yourself.  A rest spanning two days.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes.  ‘Tis certain those were my words to you.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Only, the stablehands were not apprised of this.  Not immediately, at least.  So it was that on the morning of ereyesterday, I took it upon myself to care for your horse.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Indeed… I did put you on leave rather asudden.  A deed done in the late hours three nights past.  ‘Twas my fault.  I neglected to notify the stablers.”</p><p class="calibre10">“As per usual, I fed and walked the horse, returning it to its stall after tidying up the place.”</p><p class="calibre10">“There!  That’s when you let it loose, is it!?” barked one of the leaders.  And like heated hounds, they were all of them foaming from the corner of their mouths.</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay, sir,” I shook my head slightly.  “As I’ve said time and again, I made certain to bring the horse back.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Then <i class="calibre3">where</i> is it gone, ay!?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Tame yourselves, will you please?” Emilie hushed the leaders once more.  “Rolf.  Go on.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, Mareschal,” I nodded.  “Given leave, I thought it best to also take rest from my training.  I handed in the proper papers, and thus was the leave made official for that day and the next.  I then browsed the library till dusk loomed, and from there headed off to town.”</p><p class="calibre10">“What followed?” Emilie pressed.</p><p class="calibre10">“I but remained in town till my return to headquarters very late last night.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ah, so you stayed the night,” an officer jeered instantly.  “Over at a bawdy-house, was it?  Had your way with a whore, you did!”</p><p class="calibre10">“What?”  Emilie’s eyes widened.  “That’s nonsense!  Right, Rolf?”</p><p class="calibre10">A thick silence.</p><p class="calibre10">One of the leaders pounced at the opportunity.</p><p class="calibre10">“Certainly, there are men amongst those awaiting war who are… well, <i class="calibre3">compelled</i> to part with a pretty coin for a whore only half as pretty.  For our part, war is our duty, one that has us wager away our very lives.  Thus even knights such as we have need of ‘comfort’&mdash;not least in the hours before our reckoning,” the leader expounded, not once breaking his glare upon me.  “Our ungraced here finds no place in our battles.  Yet he thought to bed with a harlot, as if to spite our good sacrifices.  Oh! <i class="calibre3">For shame.”</i></p><p class="calibre10">“R… Rolf?” said Emilie, visibly shaken.  “You were in town&mdash;what were you doing there?”</p><p class="calibre10">Indeed, Rolf Buckmann.  What were you doing?  Give away any particulars, lie or no, and the Order will be quick to question the locals for any corroboration.  There, they will find just as quickly that you were never really there at all.</p><p class="calibre10">This must not come to pass.  They must not know.  You must’ve been there, but as no more than a shadow that nary a soul would pay a mind.  What, then, will be your excuse, Rolf Buckmann?</p><p class="calibre10">“Difficult to say,” I stated, unblinking.  “I’m afraid I downed one too many bottles to remember.”</p><p class="calibre10">Anger flashed through the veins of the leaders.</p><p class="calibre10">“The <i class="calibre3">nerve!</i> Dare you jest before your Mareschal!?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Look at this <i class="calibre3">stain</i> upon the escutcheon of our Order!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Wait!  Wait, please!  Still your steeds, everyone!” Emilie shouted, having risen from her seat to soothe the livid leaders.  Afterwards, she looked at me earnestly.  “Rolf.  I shall hear from you in greater detail on the morrow.  Till then, pray be on your best behaviour,” she said, as calmly as she could.  “Please, Rolf.  Collect your thoughts.  You have my ear&mdash;so long as you speak the truth, I will hear aught you have to say.”</p><p class="calibre10">So it was that the indictments made against me were to be brought to full bear on the next morrow.  The leaders all fired their glares at me, as if their very eyes were as weapons made to kill.</p><p class="calibre10">For her part, Emilie was taken not by anger, but by anxiety.  To me she looked, her face sullenly writ with the many questions she dearly wished to ask.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">The following day.</p><p class="calibre10">The thick rustle of shuffling feet filled the air as the leadership filed into the Order conclave&mdash;a large conference space, one that I found myself standing squarely in the centre of.  Before me was a U-shaped table, great in length, at which the leadership all took their seats.</p><p class="calibre10">The panel consisted of the entirety of the 5th’s executive officers.  Not one was missing&mdash;not even Felicia.  Gathered at the behest of the three leaders from yesterday, I suspected.  The palpable ceremony of it all spoke clearly of the Order’s intent to take up the matter with utmost gravity.</p><p class="calibre10">At the very middle of the panel sat Emilie.  Her erstwhile dawn-like face was sunk with a dusked expression.</p><p class="calibre10">“Gathered are we here today to solemnly deliberate upon the failings of one Rolf Buckmann,” one of the leaders announced full-throatedly.</p><p class="calibre10">It would seem they mean to make judges of themselves.  How garish of a gathering, really.  Shawl their shoulders with the mantles of magistrates and this could very well look the legitimate tribunal.</p><p class="calibre10">“A steed of the Reuscher breed has been reported missing from its stall as of ereyesterday.  It bears mentioning that this same steed was no less a gracious gift from His Majesty to our honoured Dame Mareschal, the Lady Emilie Mernesse, for her decisive deeds in the recapture of the Godrika Minery,” the leader presented at length.  “Rolf Buckmann, swain to the Mareschal herself, finds amongst his menial duties the care of the selfsame horse.  This hearing commences on action of inquiry concerning his culpability in this grievous affair.”</p><p class="calibre10">A peculiar mien was upon the face of that leader.  One of elation, or ecstasy even.  The enthralling delight of declaiming the sins of the ungraced, from the look of him.</p><p class="calibre10">For my part, I stood ready before them all, set in my coming assertions, resolved in my rationality.</p><p class="calibre10">First things first.  The matter of the missing horse&mdash;before aught else, it is but a foul fabrication.</p><p class="calibre10">Over and over had I reviewed my actions of that day, thinking that I may have been remiss somewhere.  But nay.  My memories all point to one conclusion: on that morning, I had returned the horse to its stall, and at evenfall, found it there yet again on my way out of headquarters.</p><p class="calibre10">As for the happenings in the Albeck viscounty, I certainly will not utter a single word of it, all things considered. Chancing otherwise would invite a grave wound upon the whole of House Mernesse, and the inflicting hands are not ones to be stayed so easily.</p><p class="calibre10">The night we liberated Godrika.  I remembered it all too clearly: Emilie wept, on and on.  Her tears were pure regret itself.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">‘My heart tells me to step down as mareschal,’</i> she had confessed.  Yet two entire winters ago that was.  In all that time, she had been toiling away at her duties as our commander, that her family might find a foothold against the fickle turbulence of aristocratic life.  For House Mernesse, she would surely stay the course&mdash;as the shining mareschal to the 5th, as a devoted and loving daughter to the Mernesse family.</p><p class="calibre10">How sorrowed and pitiful she looked on that night.  It remains, to me, a vision unfading.  Her very soul itself seemed to be sobbing away.</p><p class="calibre10">Only, her misery is unabated.  Her thoughts are still ravelled.  Yet Emilie endured on and on to this day.  I dare not let it all come to naught.</p><p class="calibre10">But there was one pricking truth: keeping a tight lip about the Albeck incident and falsely admitting to losing the horse are two acts not mutually exclusive.  Were I to endeavour both, certainly I would be allowed to stay in the Order.  Emilie would make sure of it.</p><p class="calibre10">I had heretofore hung on to life here at the Order, that I might someday be knighted.</p><p class="calibre10">A childhood dream.  A soul-defining ambition.  The aspiration to become a figure of gallantry, just like in knightly tales of old.</p><p class="calibre10">The path illuminated by such prose and poetry all impelled me towards one conclusion: to affirm my faults and say my sorries.  Show them the sincerity of my remorse.  Await the coming of their good graces.  All to have my shoulders tapped by the sword.  All to be called a knight.</p><p class="calibre10">…But is that truly becoming of a knight?</p><p class="calibre10">To admit to a crime uncommitted?</p><p class="calibre10">To apologise for faults unfounded?</p><p class="calibre10">Were I to be made a knight upon a foundation of falsity, then just what is a knight?</p><p class="calibre10">The many meetings I’ve been graced with, the hard-fought battles I’ve won&mdash;all have over the years sparked the candle of change within me.  A meagre, lone candle of a change, but a candle that burned nonetheless.</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">The Mareschal Tiselius.</p><p class="calibre10">Warmly did she shower me with praise for my actions on the battlefield.  Yet what was it that she saw in me, really?</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">The cruel and cunning catoblepas.</p><p class="calibre10">Defiantly did it fight till its very last breath, a battle that shook me to my very core.  Yet what was it exactly that crossed my heart as I witnessed its final moment?</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">The trio I met at the Albeck manor.</p><p class="calibre10">Bravely did those women endeavour their first steps to gentler days ahead, after enduring so long and lamentable a nightmare.  Yet what was it that I gleaned from their hopeful eyes?</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">What…</p><p class="calibre10">What manner of man did I wish to make of myself?</p><p class="calibre10">A question I had asked myself over and over and over, through the many restless hours of an entire day.  The end of that durance of self-inquiry found me now standing in the midst of this conclave.</p><p class="calibre10">My will is steeled.</p><p class="calibre10">My soul is set.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">All stray shufflings fell silent as the leaders settled at their seats.  Their eyes, a score and more, sent their stares all to me.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf Buckmann.  Testify before us all of what actions you took on the day of the steed’s vanishing.”</p><p class="calibre10">A demand from one amongst the leadership: namely, the chairman charged with moderating the hearing.</p><p class="calibre10">“Sir,” I began.  “I was given official leave for both that very day and the day prior to it.  On the night of the latter, I went to town, and stayed there till my return in the dark hours of the former.”</p><p class="calibre10">“My my.  Stayed overnight, did he…”</p><p class="calibre10">“Sorts rather well for an ungraced, doesn’t it?  To put up some coin for a corner girl?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Look at him.  Thinks himself the lucky lad to have laid with a whore.”</p><p class="calibre10">Murmurs from all through the panel of leaders.  Veritable spit made only to wet the air.  The faces that produced them were as a circle of sneers around me, twisted and reddened with ever greater scorn.</p><p class="calibre10">I stole a glance at Felicia, finding her regard wide with shock in one moment, and furrowed from disgust in the next.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf Buckmann,” the chairman resumed.  “You make the claim that the Reuscher horse was indeed in its stall on the day preceding its reported disappearance.  Explain yourself in full detail.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, sir.  On the morning of that day, I cared for said horse as per my routine.  At the end of it, I had the horse returned to its stall; this, I am certain of.  On the evening of that same day, I checked the stalls once more before heading out to town.  Then, too, was the horse in its proper place, and this, also, I am certain of.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And what of your exact whereabouts in town?” the moderator pressed further.  “Mind!  We are well-vested with the authority to gather testimony from the citizenry.  Speak the truth, and <i class="calibre3">only</i> the truth.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I cannot recall.  I’m afraid I partook too many a mug of mead during my outing,” I stated flatly, stirring up a mixture of misgivings, impetuous incredulity, and venomous vituperations from the panel.  The commotion thundered clear through the conclave.</p><p class="calibre10">For their part, Emilie and Felicia were both seized with a look of despair.</p><p class="calibre10">“And you would have us accept such incredibility?” the chairman charged.</p><p class="calibre10">“I believe <i class="calibre3">such</i> is irrelevant.  This hearing deliberates my agency in the disappearance of the horse, not my doings in town,” I charged back.  Veins vaulted on the moderator’s face.</p><p class="calibre10">“We test your testimony precisely that we may deliberate&mdash;with any justness&mdash;the extent of your agency, <i class="calibre3">swain!</i> A man inebriated, muddied of memory&mdash;<i class="calibre3">’innocent,’</i> he insists of himself.  Tell us: what right mind would believe such folly!?”</p><p class="calibre10">“What right mind would meander from the matter at hand?” I challenged yet again.  A wave of leaders leapt up from their seats.</p><p class="calibre10">“Foul insolence!  This cur-bastard had better tame his tongue!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Your arrogance is but a brazen abuse of the mareschal’s trust in you, ungraced!”</p><p class="calibre10">A carousel of criticisms, replete with pointing fingers.  The conclave was thoroughly choked with airings of anger.</p><p class="calibre10">“Calm!  Calm, please!  Everyone!  We must have order!” Emilie raised her voice, bringing quiet to the hearing once more.  She then looked to me, and with clarity and carefulness both, brought forth her own inquiry.  “Rolf…  You must know, ‘tis quite difficult for me&mdash;or anyone, really&mdash;to believe in something so absurd as a loss of memory from having too hard a drink.  Pray tell us all.  What… what was it that you were up to?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I do not remember.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…  Do you truly mean that?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I do.”</p><p class="calibre10">Her brows sank.  Sorrow, irritation&mdash;such was the shade upon her face.</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Tis certain,” she continued, “I’ve not forbidden our officers from fraternising with the brothels.  Yet… yet I cannot think that you would buy yourself a woman on a whim, Rolf.  Just the same, I cannot think that you, of all of whom I know, would drink yourself to an amnesiac stupor.  Tell me, Rolf…  What am I to believe?”</p><p class="calibre10">“As I’ve stated before, Mareschal, my actions in town are not pertinent to the purposes of this hearing.  Neither have I let the horse loose, nor has any evidence been brought to bear that abets otherwise.  This is the simple truth of it.”</p><p class="calibre10">“But Rolf…  You well-recount having returned my horse to its stall, yet you also claim that you cannot recall what transpired in town.  Wouldn’t you say that’s rather… convenient?”</p><p class="calibre10">“No, Mareschal.  I would not.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…Rolf…”  Her face foundered again in sombre.  The leadership around her, however, were quick to pounce on her plight.</p><p class="calibre10">“Madame.  ‘Tis clear as the summer sun that you neither believe Buckmann to be culpable, nor see him as the sort to commit this fault.  Yet we of the leadership bear a position that is quite the contrary.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Agreed!” another leader cut in.  “Trustworthy he may have been in your childhood, but such verdant days have long since dusked.  He stands as an ungraced before us all&mdash;an ungraced good-for-nothing of an <i class="calibre3">alga,</i> no less!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Why…  Sirs!” Emilie turned to them, vexed.  “You speak beyond your boun&mdash;”</p><p class="calibre10">“To begin with,” I interjected, “I was freed of my swainly duties during the time of my leave&mdash;a time that includes the day the horse disappeared.”</p><p class="calibre10">Verily did Emilie try to shield me&mdash;sincerely and sonorously so&mdash;but more verily again did she require shielding of her own.  Her position was at stake; she verged right on the cusp of being doubted by the leaders for placing our intimacy above the integrity of the Order.  Something had to be done before she took one step too far.</p><p class="calibre10">“It stands to reason, then: on that day, responsibility for the horse was <i class="calibre3">not</i> in my hands.  To charge me so in spite of this is injustice,” I deflected their indictments, once again rousing the panel into a riot.  Their gripes filled the conclave air, more so than ever before.</p><p class="calibre10">“What gall!  Are you fain for contempt, ungraced!?”</p><p class="calibre10">“You insist upon your own innocence, yet dare blame us all in the same breath!?”</p><p class="calibre10">“You all!  Tame yourselves!  We must maintain order!” Emilie attempted again to soothe the seething leaders, whose collective anger and enmity was fast reaching a rolling boil.</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie, love,” Raakel called in the midst of the chaos.  “That mickle-berk’s gone an’ done it, I really reckon.  But look at ‘im.  Pretends the turtle tuck’d in his shell, he does, afear’d we might ‘im out fer the hangdog hyaena what he is.  So, his next plan o’ action?  A thin chelpin’ ‘bout how he can’t recall&mdash;a stinkin’ lie, it is, fresh from his arse.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Indeed.  We would do well to sooner trust our noses than his words,” Sheila said disinterestedly.  For his part, Gerd kept his lips sealed tight.</p><p class="calibre10">“My fair Mareschal.  This Buckmann fellow, he seems too stubborn to rightly say his sorries.  His farce tarnishes the sheen of our esteemed Order&mdash;why, I say we ought to oust him from these halls.  ‘Tis our only course out of this circus,” suggested one leader, with whom the others hungrily joined in.</p><p class="calibre10">Their mareschal stood silent, her eyes shut away from the scene.  But before long, she looked to me once more.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Rolf,” Emilie started quietly.  “Pray speak the truth.  I beg of you…”</p><p class="calibre10">I but breathed as my answer.  Felicia, seemingly fed up, shook her head at my reticence.  In contrast, Emilie kept her patience and pressed on.</p><p class="calibre10">“…We’ll not thrust you into the streets and allow your return only once you’ve retrieved the horse&mdash;that’s not our intent.  We but dearly wish to know the truth of it all, and to hear from your own lips a proper testimony.  That’s all we want from you, Rolf.  Truly.”</p><p class="calibre10">Even then, I did not budge.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf.  Is this really too much to ask of you?”</p><p class="calibre10">Even then, I stood firm.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“…Brother.”</i> A call from Felicia, small but steeled of timbre.  A single word that egged me on to apologise at once.</p><p class="calibre10">Only, I did not.</p><p class="calibre10">“You’ll become a knight one day, won’t you Rolf?” Emilie continued, her voice dark with desperation.  “No knight can keep himself so unspotted along the long toils of his path; certainly, he may err somewhere along the way.  But when he does, he makes certain to accept his faults, that he may reflect upon and hone himself further.  This is what a true knight is… isn’t it?  At least, I should like to think so.”</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Tis as the good Mareschal says!”</p><p class="calibre10">“You might do yourself a great favour to heed her words, ungraced!”</p><p class="calibre10">“How about you show a smidgen of decency for once!?  Set a good example for all your fellow good-for-nothings out there, eh!?”</p><p class="calibre10">The leaders arduously echoed their sycophancy for Emilie’s pleas.  But this time, she made no effort to silence them.  Rather, she loosened her grip upon their leashes, that they may continue their barking fits for the while.  When all was settled again, she spoke once more.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf.  You shall apologise at once.”</p><p class="calibre10">Words, clear and calm, conveyed with her azure regard fixed straight upon me.  The leaders were quiet.  Her mighty mien had stayed their instinct for interjection.</p><p class="calibre10">‘Yes.  I admit to the loss of the horse.  For that, I am deeply sorry.’</p><p class="calibre10">Were I to utter those words, this entire ordeal would be done and dealt with.  That much was certain.  The leadership would no doubt be insatiate from so insipid an ending.  But equally doubtless would be Emilie’s unceasing efforts to protect me from their ire.</p><p class="calibre10">And just like that, all would return to as they once were.</p><p class="calibre10">I would remain by Emilie’s side, striving day by day on the path towards knighthood.</p><p class="calibre10">Days, each spent in her dear company.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet, my soul was set.</p><p class="calibre10">Set upon the words that must be said.</p><p class="calibre10">Set upon a resolve that must be revealed.</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre6" /> &nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">“I will not.”</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;<br class="calibre6" /> &nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">The ensuing silence was as a fog falling upon the conclave.  Emilie was astonished.  Unmistakably so.  The words that left my lips were to her as unforeseen as a bolt of lightning on a clear summer day.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…?”</p><p class="calibre10">Her small voice echoed.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet mine did not answer.</p><p class="calibre10">“W… were we not clear… perchance?  Rolf, if you refuse to accept your faults and apologise before us all, then I’m afraid we… we have little choice…”</p><p class="calibre10">Her voice waned.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet mine was unwavering.</p><p class="calibre10">“I’ll not bend the knee&mdash;not under the weight of odds so stacked against me.  To coerce me so is a grave folly.”</p><p class="calibre10">“P… please, Rolf.  Weren’t you striving all these years to become a knight…?”</p><p class="calibre10">Silence.</p><p class="calibre10">“Was it not your dearest dream…?”</p><p class="calibre10">Silence, yet again.</p><p class="calibre10">“Why…!?  Why will you not yield!?  You have only to apologise and this will all be over!”</p><p class="calibre10">It will indeed.  The leadership craved an ending no less than she, albeit one woven of a different thread, of which they were quick to expound upon their mareschal as they roused themselves once more.</p><p class="calibre10">“Mareschal!  We are decided!  We find this fool ill-fitting of our Order!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Madame!  Your verdict!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf!  Please!  Apologise and I will forgive you here and now!  Just… <i class="calibre3">apologise…!”</i> Emilie raised her voice clear in my direction, half-drowned out by the leaders’ fit of snarls.</p><p class="calibre10">“Mareschal!  See how he spurns the olive branch!  Such contempt is never inculpable!”</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">I have always known.</p><p class="calibre10">Always.</p><p class="calibre10">That there would come a time when Emilie and I would go our separate ways.</p><p class="calibre10">The day I found myself to be ungraced was the day our futures forked apart.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet amidst such misfortune was a blessing.  Small, but cherished all the more: five years.</p><p class="calibre10">Five more, of her company.</p><p class="calibre10">Five more, by her side.</p><p class="calibre10">To see her.</p><p class="calibre10">To hear her.</p><p class="calibre10">To help her.</p><p class="calibre10">But now, our time together is spent dry; the hour-sand, silenced of its flow. I’ve supported her, given her counsel, and taught her aught and all that could avail her.  House Albeck, the haunt of hedonists that sought to consign her to a foul fate, met its own by my hands.</p><p class="calibre10">I have done for her all that I can.</p><p class="calibre10">No longer will she have need of me.</p><p class="calibre10">From here on out, she has but to ply her fame, and the fortunes she fights so hard for will surely be hers.</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…”</p><p class="calibre10">“This hearing is all but heard, Mareschal.  We are decided.  We are resolute.  Condemn him!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Please… Rolf…  This isn’t… this isn’t how…”</p><p class="calibre10">“Madame!”</p><p class="calibre10">This was it.  The fates have played their hand.  I was but a pawn cornered by their cunning, but having seen the game for what it was, I knew no good would come from wavering now.</p><p class="calibre10">I’ve made my peace.</p><p class="calibre10">“Mareschal,” I called firmly.  “I, too, am resolute.”</p><p class="calibre10">“But… but, Rolf…  It can’t end… not like this…”</p><p class="calibre10">There was confusion in every facet of her bearing.  And for Felicia, naught but disbelief, to be forced to witness her woeful brother at the centre such a storm.</p><p class="calibre10">We looked at length upon each other, Emilie and I.  And in so doing, quietude returned to the conclave.  The leaders, one and all, turned to their mareschal, waiting with bated breath for her words.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie’s eyes.</p><p class="calibre10">Large and crystal blue, veritable jewels I’d beheld since the time my heart first began taking shape.  Those same eyes now quivered with sorrow.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">‘Why?’</i> they seem to ask.</p><p class="calibre10">But I could accord them no answer at all.</p><p class="calibre10">Were I able, I would have liked very much to thank her for filling my days with both brightness and beauty.  Yet to do so in the livid company of the leadership was to fan an unforgiving flame.</p><p class="calibre10">Not that this day could have suffered such luxury, anyway.  The time for warmth and honesty had long passed us by.</p><p class="calibre10">And that was precisely why I only looked on.</p><p class="calibre10">On and on, upon those same eyes.</p><p class="calibre10">Perhaps there was nothing left in me to tell her.  In spite of it, I could not help but keep my gaze fixed upon hers.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…”</p><p class="calibre10">I could not answer.  Within me was found nothing that could be said.</p><p class="calibre10">And so another silence grew again between us.  A silence heralding the end to our halcyon days.  We stood face to face.  Nothing more.  Nothing less.</p><p class="calibre10">Even then, my determination remained undulled.  To part from Emilie was painful, most certainly.  Yet this was a wound I chose to bear.</p><p class="calibre10">There was no turning back.</p><p class="calibre10">No more second thoughts.</p><p class="calibre10">At the end of that enduring silence, Emilie shut her eyes.  Before long, they were revealed once more.</p><p class="calibre10">Eyes free from the bitterness and bafflement of her heart.</p><p class="calibre10">The eyes of the “Aureola”, the Lady Emilie Mernesse, Dame Mareschal to the 5th Chivalric Order.</p>

<p class="calibre13">“…Rolf Buckmann.”</p><p class="calibre10">She called with deliberateness.  Setting her eyes upon mine, she moved her lips once more, slowly, to intonate her next words with nary a spark of spirit in their timbre.</p>
<p class="calibre13">“I hereby discharge you from your service, and exile you from our Order.”</p>
