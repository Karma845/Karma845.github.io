<p class="calibre10">Into vivid view emerged the headquarters of the 5th Chivalric Order, honoured home and hall of the knights.</p><p class="calibre10">As our carriage passed through the main portcullis, a vast training field spanned before our eyes.  This stretch of land supposedly also served as a staging area for the entirety of the 5th; an appropriate purpose, for the field reached far and wide indeed.  Encapsulating it was a winding wall, generous in its circular embrace.</p><p class="calibre10">Facing the field was a grand edifice: the headquarters proper.  As bastions of the kingdom, the five Chivalric Orders are numbered according to their power and prestige, with the 5th being the lowest.  Yet in spite of this, the headquarters’ construction was most impressive and imposing, clothed as it was in brilliant arrays of brickwork.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie and I summarily disembarked our carriage and joined the procession of recruits wending its way into the training grounds.  There, we all assembled before a speech platform, onto which stepped a man of little more than thirty years of age.</p><p class="calibre10">“Hail and well met, little lions!” his voice thundered.  “As Knight Mareschal of this esteemed 5th Chivalric Order, I, Bartt Tallien, welcome you!  One and all!”</p><p class="calibre10">Knight Mareschal&mdash;that would make him the top military commander to the Order.  Quite young for the position, this Bartt Tallien.  But a rarity?  Not so.</p><p class="calibre10">The 5th functions on the side as something of a college, where the sons and daughters of nobility descend to earn their investitures and build their aristocratic careers.  It is also host to commonborn personnel; while it has its fair share of long-serving veterans, great in number, too, are those choosing to abide the coming of more fruitful opportunities.</p><p class="calibre10">Thus a quick turnover here was not at all strange, even amongst members of the top brass.  That the mareschal himself was relatively early in his years for his station, therefore, should elicit no surprise.</p><p class="calibre10">“Joyous am I overmuch!  To give salute to you all!  And as equals henceforth, to join swords with you that we might further bolster the aegis of our kingdom!”</p><p class="calibre10">This Mareschal Tallien, too, counts himself amongst the nobility.  His manner of speech certainly sounded the part, to say nothing of the ornate armour that encased him, silver as it was&mdash;just like his tongue.</p><p class="calibre10">Ah, yes.  Silver: the most excellent of all odyllic conductors.  Arms and armaments forged of this metal can be made effective to an extreme once infused with odyl.  Within the Orders, only those ranked lieutenant or higher are fitted with such equipment.</p><p class="calibre10">Beyond its functionality, the argent gear is also beautiful in both shape and craftsmanship, and is surely the subject of much admiration from officers lesser-ranked.  Of course, such things were no less trivial than trinkets to one void of odyl like myself.</p><p class="calibre10">“We shall smite the foul Nafílim whence they fester!” Mareschal Tallien continued. <i class="calibre3">“That</i> is our solemn duty, to which we pledge our very lives!  For King and Country!  For Family and our fellow Man!  From this day henceforth till the hour of your last breath, my little lions, deign not to forget this!”</p><p class="calibre10">Thus marked the end of the mareschal’s opening speech.  His second-in-command, the under-mareschal, appeared next to present to us a rundown of the headquarters’ facilities.</p><p class="calibre10">At ground level were numerous training areas and offices for each of the brigades.  Further furnished with bathhouses, a mess hall, and other like amenities, much of a knight’s time was to be spent here, from the look of it.</p><p class="calibre10">The second floor housed rooms for conferencing and the storage of reference materials, as well as communal barracks shared by the officers.</p><p class="calibre10">Private quarters for Order members of lieutenant rank and up were located on the third floor&mdash;any other officer required authorisation to step foot upon this level.</p><p class="calibre10">Facilities other than these, such as the smithy and a simple shop, were located in separate buildings, it seemed.  I’d wager one could scarcely leave the headquarters’ grounds and still live in comfort.</p><p class="calibre10">An order was then announced: we were to assemble at the training field at the next light of dawn.  With that, we were given free reign for the rest of our first day at the Order; the next was to be the official entrance ceremony.</p><p class="calibre10">“Well… that’s it, then,” said Emilie.  “We should meet again later, Rolf.  In the mess hall, let’s say.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’ll see you there.”</p><p class="calibre10">With a new promise of a supper to be spent together, Emilie went off on her way to the women’s barracks.  The promise did not stand, however, for later that night, I found her missing from the mess hall.</p>

<p class="calibre10">The skies wheeled to the next morning.  Assembled upon the training field were we recruits, just as ordered.  Only, here too, was Emilie nowhere to be seen.</p><p class="calibre10">The entrance ceremony was set to begin, and later in its course, the brigade assignments themselves.  It bears reiterating that one does not immediately become a knight upon joining a brigade.  Recruits start life at the Order as swains: underlings in attendance to a senior knight, from whom they learn the particulars of chivalric duty.</p><p class="calibre10">With the ceremony commencing in earnest, a stately, well-built man stepped onto the speech platform&mdash;one Marquis Norden, master of the eponymous march upon which the 5th Chivalric Order’s headquarters itself was situated.  As lord seneschal, the charge of the 5th’s operations fell to him, and consequently the budget for such flowed through his coffers.</p><p class="calibre10">It seemed he paid visits to the headquarters throughout the year.  The annual entrance ceremony was one such occasion, during which he would give his briefing.  This year was no different.</p><p class="calibre10">Thankfully, the marquis made himself not a man to mince words, and so kept the briefing short.  What followed thereafter was supposed to be the brigade assignments, but the under-mareschal handling the ceremony’s proceedings instead spoke words that none expected.</p><p class="calibre10">“We shall now commence the rites of investiture!”</p><p class="calibre10">The marquis then took the opportunity to put in a word himself.</p><p class="calibre10">“Justly do I host the many of you, subjects of this Order so entrusted to me by His Majesty.  And all the more so, should you avail us with excellency of service.  Indeed, the worthy amongst you shall ever be accorded that which is your due.  Of this, I entreat you all to know, and know well.”</p><p class="calibre10">At the knights’ signal, a girl joined the marquis on the platform.</p><p class="calibre10">“To wit, here stands the Lady Emilie Mernesse.”</p><p class="calibre10">Investiture.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">My eyes widened.</p><p class="calibre10">“Newly inducted on this day, like the lot of you.  But by way of the Roun of Orisons, she has been graced with extraordinary odyl&mdash;the most, mind you, in all the written annals of this Order.  Duly and solemnly do I pay reverence to her promised power, and so on this day shall I confer to her the honour and duty of damehood.”</p><p class="calibre10">The recruits hummed with whispers and rustles.  This was unheard of&mdash;a new officer, not only skipping the toil of swainhood, but being knighted right at the start of her first year.</p>

<div class="calibre6"><figure><div class="calibre6"><img src="https://lightnovelstranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/sskvol1illus04-1.png" alt="" height="500" width="350" /></div></figure></div>

<p class="calibre10">“…I see.  So that was the way of it,” I thought aloud.  I understood then why Emilie had been absent: she was informed that a coming rite of investiture was to receive her, and had been preparing for the accolade from night till dawn.</p><p class="calibre10">In the evening before one’s knighting, the body must be bathed and purified.  Thereafter, one must suffer a sleepless night with a sword ever-clasped in both hands.  Such is the custom of this kingdom’s Chivalric Orders.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie was stiff in her expression, as if arrested by anxiety.  She then knelt before the marquis and offered up her sword.  The nobleman received it, and unsheathing it, presented the sword skyward.  Then, with the flat of the blade, he tapped Emilie’s shoulders three times.</p><p class="calibre10">Standard procedure for an accolade.  In eras past, it was a simplified rite of investiture carried out on the battlefield.  However, it was retained for use in more peaceful circumstances, as per the Orders’ conviction that a knight’s battle with the Nafílim endures ever more.</p><p class="calibre10">Recalling such details, I watched on as Emilie took back her sword and rose to her feet.  A tinge of worry clouded her countenance.  She peered through the lines of recruits, as if looking for someone.  Then, hanging her head, affixed the sword to her hip.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie was made a dame.</p><p class="calibre10">The dream I long held&mdash;realised in the blink of an eye.</p><p class="calibre10">At that moment, I felt something of a distance growing between us.  Where we once peered at the horizon together, I now stood alone, looking on as Emilie faded further into the reach.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>

<p class="calibre10">With Emilie’s accolade done, the under-mareschal returned to the platform and raised his voice.</p><p class="calibre10">“We shall now announce the brigade assignments!”</p><p class="calibre10">One by one, the recruits were then told of which brigade they would serve.  Cavalry, infantry, sorcery, support, logistics, and so on&mdash;the Order has no shortage of specialised brigades.  Each is further split into three by number, and to which a recruit is assigned is determined by aptitude.</p><p class="calibre10">Delight and displeasure, conviction and consternation&mdash;the whole gamut of emotions were on display as the recruits each received their assignments.</p><p class="calibre10">“Next: Rolf Buckmann!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Here, sir!”</p><p class="calibre10">“You shall henceforth go with the Owlcrane Brigade!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Aye, sir!”</p><p class="calibre10">A stir erupted amongst those present.</p><p class="calibre10">The Owlcrane Brigade: a unit under the direct supervision of the mareschal.</p><p class="calibre10">In his time, St. Rakliammelech was said to have a fondness for birds, especially so for owls and cranes, hence the rather poetic eponym.  Operational in all the five Orders, this brigade comprises only those truly capable.</p><p class="calibre10">But therein lies the rub: what designs would a brigade of such import have for someone void of odyl as me?  The whole of it was concealed from my ken.  In its place, then, was the ill foreboding that began to gnaw at me.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">The assembled recruits soon dispersed, each heading off to the offices of his respective brigade.</p><p class="calibre10">These offices were not individual buildings in and of themselves, but were instead each housed in different sections of the headquarters proper.  Large spaces they were, but for its part, the Owlcrane Brigade had no office of its own, and for good reason: it is, for all intents and purposes, a cut above the other brigades.</p><p class="calibre10">Only a select few compose this special unit, but what it lacks in number, it makes up with executive privilege, for its members are counted amongst the highest echelons of the 5th’s leadership.  As such, they are each accorded a private quarters of their own, and as with the mareschal, the Owlcranes are often occupied with administrative duties, and so are not ones to while away in the confines of an office.</p><p class="calibre10">All fine and well, but there was one matter: I knew not of where to report.  I relayed my situation to the under-mareschal, who then proceeded to beckon to a man nearby.</p><p class="calibre10">“You there, Gerd.  The Owlcranes move to flock as well?”</p><p class="calibre10">“They do, sir.  I go to join with them myself,” he confirmed.  Well-groomed and well-shaped of hair and nose, this “Gerd” was, by all accounts, the image of a dashing young man.</p><p class="calibre10">“Take this fledgling along then, will you?  He’s one of yours now.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Him?”  Sharp eyes darted to me.  “Will do, sir.”  With a swift turn upon his heels, Gerd proceeded on his way.  “Come.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Aye, sir,” I answered, trailing him.</p><p class="calibre10">From the sound of the earlier exchange, Gerd, too, wore the feathers of the Owlcrane Brigade.  And befitting of that executive position, silver armour adorned his entire body.</p><p class="calibre10">Through the training grounds we walked, and finally leaving it, entered the opulent monolith that was the headquarters proper.  Its halls bustled with personnel, made busier still with the influx of recruits finding their way.  Not so with the second floor, where we then found ourselves.</p><p class="calibre10">As we emerged into an empty corridor, Gerd spoke up once more.</p><p class="calibre10">“So, what’s your deal?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Deal, sir?”</p><p class="calibre10">Our voices, along with our footfalls, echoed through the ornate space.</p><p class="calibre10">“I’ve heard of you.”  Gerd turned to me, leering as he walked.  “Of how there’s nary a wisp of odyl in that soul of yours.  But hearsay is a thing to be gainsaid.  So I say again: <i class="calibre3">what</i> is your deal?”</p><p class="calibre10">In those eyes: unclouded scorn.</p><p class="calibre10">“It is my lot, sir,” I answered evenly.  “The face of the dice cast by the Roun of Orisons.”</p><p class="calibre10">“By the Deiva’s hand, you mean.  Hands that bore you no gift&mdash;none at all.  Is that it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“That is correct, yes.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yoná, Almighty,” he turned ahead with a mutter.  The very idea of a man left odylless seemed utterly incredulous to Gerd.  “Even Her benevolence has its bounds, then.”</p><p class="calibre10">“It would seem so.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Benevolence that sooner spared your soul than spared you a scrap of odyl.  What humour is this?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m afraid I’m just as baffled.”</p><p class="calibre10">A man ungraced.  He who should not walk this earth.  To such a man&mdash;deviant of the world’s order&mdash;Gerd showed his unbridled disgust.</p><p class="calibre10">“And so the black sheep of Yoná’s herd intends to join the Order.  With what foul aim, I wonder?”</p><p class="calibre10">“The aim of becoming a knight, sir.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Look here, you.”</p><p class="calibre10">With a twist of his heels and shoulders both, Gerd set himself right into my midst and seized me by the collars.  A thud bellowed down the marbled halls as I was pressed against the wall.</p><p class="calibre10">“We’re not here to frolic and make merry,” he said in a low voice, seething with ire.  “This place smells of banquets to your cur snout, does it?  Huh?  Think yourself the silver-spoon hound?  Here to lick your helpings of fiefs and titles off the silver platters?  Is that what the 5th is to you?  Well, sorry to say, <i class="calibre3">hound,</i> that’s hardly the way of things here.  Serious business, it is&mdash;day in, day out.”</p><p class="calibre10">The grip on my collars strained with pure force.</p><p class="calibre10">“Sir, I am not come for decorations,” I clarified.  “Knighthood is what I seek; <i class="calibre3">that</i> is no lie.”</p><p class="calibre10">“What are you playing at, hm?  A discarded dog dares to don the armour of his knightly masters; how will he, now?  Huh?  Your fangs, your claws, they are dead and dulled of all sharpness.  Yet you mean to bare them in <i class="calibre3">battle!?”</i></p><p class="calibre10">“I do.  I <i class="calibre3">will.”</i></p><p class="calibre10">With a scornful click of his tongue, Gerd threw down my collars.  Turning about, he resumed on his way.</p><p class="calibre10">“Nevermind the lack of odyl&mdash;sounds like you’ve not even the wits to figure out your damned place here. <i class="calibre3">Scum,</i> the lot of you.”</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">Up another staircase we ascended, emerging at the third floor&mdash;Gerd’s destination, and perhaps the most exclusive space in the entire building.</p><p class="calibre10">“You’ve heard it once at orientation, but I’ll air it again: think to tread here without proper permission, and you best turn back,” he warned.</p><p class="calibre10">“Understood, sir,” I answered.</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh?  Did you, now?  Really?  A stone might more swiftly understand than you, by my measure.”</p><p class="calibre10">It seemed Gerd took no small umbrage from having to show me through so consecrated a section of the headquarters.</p><p class="calibre10">“Then it’s lost that race, sir; I shall request permission for entry as needed.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hmph…”</p><p class="calibre10">Following him through the black marble corridor, we soon arrived at a door adorned with a title plate, reading “Chamber of the Knight Mareschal”.  Gerd gave a knock and proceeded inside.  I followed, finding the room occupied with four other knights.</p><p class="calibre10">“Officer Gerd Kranz, reporting.”  A salute directed at a man seated further in: Bartt Tallien himself, Knight Mareschal to the 5th Chivalric Order.</p><p class="calibre10">“Come, have you?  Our parliament of four is assembled, then,” said Tallien.  Those present numbered six in total; it would seem the commander did not count himself&mdash;and myself, for that matter.  “Behold Emilie: the Owlcranes.  My personal guard, and your assigned brigade.”</p><p class="calibre10">True to his word, Emilie was also here.  The new silver armour enshrouding her figure ill-matched the melancholic and apologetic look she laid upon me.</p><p class="calibre10">“Introductions, then,” Tallien began again.  “First, we have Gerd Kranz, the spellblade.  This lad is eldest amongst you all.  That being said, he has yet to shed his fledgeling feathers, as I am sure you can see.  Gerd, I forget your age.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Twenty, sir,” answered Gerd.  “A pleasure, Emilie.  Gerd is my name.  An honour it is to have you.”</p><p class="calibre10">“The pleasure and honour are mine both, thank you,” returned Emilie.  The two then shook hands.</p><p class="calibre10">Twenty years of age.  Already the eldest in this unit.  While the 5th was well-known for its high turnover, it was especially so for the Owlcranes, from the look of it.  Then again, being twenty here meant five years spent in service.  And with this being the start of his sixth, Gerd’s was certainly not the tenure of a novice.</p><p class="calibre10">“Next, we have Raakel Nyholm, warrior of magicks, and our surgien, Sheila Larsen,” Tallien continued.</p><p class="calibre10">“Raakel, that be me,” the warrior greeted.  “Already caught word o’ ye, I have&mdash;the one with the er… ‘Aureola’, were it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Th-that’s right.  The particulars escape me, but Yoná’s ways are ever a mystery, ‘twould seem,” were Emilie’s humble words.</p><p class="calibre10">“Another ace in us ranks, ey?  Chuff’d to hear it.  I reckon ye’ll be doin’ fine service fer us.”</p><p class="calibre10">Hands were shaken once again, and another was offered forth.</p><p class="calibre10">“Miss Emilie, I am pleased to make your acquaintance.  I am Sheila, a mender,” the last of the Owlcranes curtsied.  “The crossing of our paths is surely the charity of Yoná, Deiva Most Divine.  For this, I am most thankful.”</p><p class="calibre10">“The pleasure is mine, Officer Sheila,” Emilie curtsied back.  “‘Tis my sincere hope to work well hand-in-hand with the both of you.”</p><p class="calibre10">These two new women seemed younger somewhat than Gerd, by no more than a couple years perhaps.</p><p class="calibre10">Raakel was the larger of the two, tall of figure and crowned with a blaze of red hair.  Her toned yet supple muscles were apparent even through her uniform.  Rather than a swordfighter, she was classified as a warrior, a fact made clear by the silver war-maul slung at her lower back.</p><p class="calibre10">The other, Sheila, seemed the opposite, with long, dark hair tinged in blue.  Being capable of mending magicks makes one an indispensable asset in combat, but it seemed that Sheila was also blessed with an immense degree of odyl, befitting of her position as an executive officer.  The seeming portrait of a surgien, she held her choice weapon, the silver staff, close to her bosom.</p><p class="calibre10">“You are amidst the mighty, Emilie.  And like you, they are all hatched from ennobled nests.  Let us get along, shall we?” said Tallien.</p><p class="calibre10">It was then that he rose from his desk and sauntered to the centre of the room, elaborating upon the Owlcrane Brigade’s purpose in the meanwhile.</p><p class="calibre10">“At its core, this unit serves as my shield&mdash;a retinue of bodyguards, if you will.  However, be not so fain to seek battle, for any situation that calls for my direct intervention is&mdash;well, nothing short of an ‘operational misadventure’ by that point, I should say.  Nasty business, it is, one that this unit should never be forced to deal with, simply put.  Do you understand this, Emilie?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Er… yes, I do.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yet the bodyguards to a commander such as I must needs be no less than the very best.  And so it is with this unit.  Therefore must you always hone both skill and coordination with your fellow Owlcranes.  To that end, I entreat that you steel your resolve and fulfil your duties to the very best of your ability.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Y-yes, Mareschal!  I will!” Emilie nearly yelped from nervousness.</p><p class="calibre10">“I suppose it will not do to work you so, today being your first with us and all.  Emilie, you are dismissed.  Spend the rest of the day as you please,” said Tallien.  “Hah, I jest!  Let us not make roost-whilers of ourselves.  Come now!  We fly to the training grounds.  I must needs measure how boldly your talons bite, Dame Emilie!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Y-yes, sir!”</p><p class="calibre10">With the war against the Nafílim having long settled into an unceasing state of conflict, even the 5th&mdash;known, as it was, for being solely where the sons and daughters of the nobility come to earn their investitures&mdash;could ill-afford to stagnate into a band of dallying knights, idly awaiting their reward or their reckoning.  The Owlcranes themselves were no different.  Their faces were stern as they headed off to the training grounds&mdash;faces that spared not a single glance upon me.</p><p class="calibre10">That is, save for Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">“Um, Mareschal, sir…” she called to Tallien, whilst glimpsing sporadically at me.</p><p class="calibre10">“Hm?  Ah…”</p><p class="calibre10">This would be the first time the mareschal and I made eye contact.  But the moment lasted no more than an instant before Tallien’s glance broke away.</p><p class="calibre10">“Come,” he commanded, devoid of any interest.</p><p class="calibre10">“Aye, sir.”</p><p class="calibre10">Orders, clear and concise&mdash;well-becoming a nest of knights.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">With briskness, the mareschal made his way to the training grounds.  The Owlcrane retinue went in tow, and following behind, I found myself not infrequently glanced upon my Emilie.  Her eyes told much, of matters teetering on the tip of her tongue.  Yet confiding now was a luxury none of the others would’ve allowed, and so with nary a word whispered between us, on we went to our destination.</p><p class="calibre10">Upon arrival did we disperse, with Gerd taking the liberty of pulling out a sword from a weapons rack nearby.</p><p class="calibre10">“The arms on these grounds, you can use as you like.  Don’t worry: they’re feders, rounded proper, see?  The ones over here that number fewer&mdash;they’re of the silver sort,” Gerd broached, before handing the blunted blade to Emilie.  “Here you are, then.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh, but… an iron one will do just fine, I think.  ‘Tis what I’m used to.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Now, Emilie.  You’re one of us now.  A proud Owlcrane.  And by rights, that makes you an executive officer,” Gerd reiterated.  “Protocol compels you to make use of argent gear such as this.”</p><p class="calibre10">Raakel and Sheila both saw fit to further persuade Emilie, who yet seemed hesitant.</p><p class="calibre10">“No virtue in playin’ the mousy milquetoast now, Emilie, least not when it comes to arms.  Top blades fer the top brass, they always say.  Look here, me maul’s no diff’rent&mdash;aglint with silver, she is!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Do understand, Miss Emilie.  The meek look to us leaders of the Order to answer malice with might, and a mere miser of arms all but ill-avails them.  The Order’s strength grows greater still should you brandish only the finest of weapons.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I… yes, I suppose I should.  Thank you, Officers Raakel, Sheila,” Emilie relented.</p><p class="calibre10">“An’ fettle that too, while yer at it,” quipped Raakel.</p><p class="calibre10">“F-fettle?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ranks, titles, all that prim an’ prissy tongue waggin’&mdash;we don’t need aught o’ that here.  Ain’t that right, Gerd?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Right you are, Raakel.  We Owlcranes, we’re all compeers!  Well, Sheila’s a mite different&mdash;won’t loosen that polite tongue no matter what.  But you can slacken your shoulders ‘round me and Raakel, at least.  That ring proper to you, Emilie?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, si&mdash;ah, I mean, al-all right.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Good,” Gerd nodded with satisfaction, before taking up a silver feder of his own.  “Right, we’ll start with the basics, then: channelling odyl through silver.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Got it, Offi&mdash;um, Gerd.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You’ll get the hang of it,” he chuckled.  “Having said that, the basics of weaving odyl are well-put in that pate of yours, I take it?  When the odyl was imparted to you, that is.”</p><p class="calibre10">“They are.  The knowledge&mdash;it came along with Yoná’s grace.”</p><p class="calibre10">For someone forsaken by the Deiva Herself, this was news to my ears.</p><p class="calibre10">“Channelling will be child’s play to you, then.  And with a bit of practice, you’ll take to conjuring all sorts of magicks in no time,” Gerd assured.  “I must admit, I am quite the cat taken with curiosity in seeing what heights you’ll reach, Emilie&mdash;or should I say, Lady of the ‘Aureola’?  Hah, well, here’s hoping you’ll give us a nice show of it, eh?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Er, right, I’ll do my best!” answered Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">Onward stretched the training session.  For two or so hours, the Owlcranes coddled Emilie as she arduously cleared hurdle after hurdle.  By the end of it, success was found at last: there she stood, her argent arm and armour properly suffused with odyl.  Raising up her feder, she found its now magicked blade most mesmerising to the eyes.</p><p class="calibre10">“Gerd, have I… have I done it?” she said, unable to pry her gaze away from her wondrous achievement.</p><p class="calibre10">“That you have, Emilie.  And a job well done at that; look, odyl flows clean through your gear,” examined Gerd.  “And your blade is made more keen withal.  Can you tell?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I-I can,” nodded Emilie, her voice aloft with heightened spirits.  “When the channelling finished, it felt as though my feder became something else entirely.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Mine eyes had not fooled me, then,” Sheila observed.  “As with Mr. Gerd, it would seem you bear talent as a spellblade, Miss Emilie.”</p><p class="calibre10">“An’ a grand one, at that!” lauded Raakel.  “Though, I were wishin’ fer a warrior chum, if I’m honest.”</p><p class="calibre10">“It’s just as well.  She’s long-practised in swordplay, from the look of it,” said Gerd.  “What of your armour, Emilie?  You feel a paling all about your body, I take it?”</p><p class="calibre10">As if to confirm Gerd’s words, Emilie placed a hand upon her chest.  “Y-yes, I feel it.  As though my whole being is well-protected.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Paling emanates from silver armour and wraps ‘round the body whole.  As you are now, neither unmagicked blade can scratch you, nor unmagicked spear prick.  You are as a fortress to them, really,” Gerd explained, before turning to me.  “You.  Fetch yourself a feder and come.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Aye, sir.”</p><p class="calibre10">An abrupt order coming at the tail end of some hours spent being wholly unattended to.  It was only Emilie who thought to pay me any sort of mind, as from time to time did she turn a glance my way.  But I suppose the eyes of the Owlcranes were hardly unclouded to my presence.  What an honour.</p><p class="calibre10">With an iron feder fresh from the weapons rack, I made my way to Emilie and Gerd.</p><p class="calibre10">“You.  Go on.  Attack Emilie with that sword of yours,” commanded Gerd.  “Emilie, you need not lift a finger.  Stay where you are and enjoy the show.  Got that?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I-I do,” answered Emilie.  “All right, Rolf.  Shall we, then?”</p><p class="calibre10">“We shall.  Let’s get to it, Emilie&mdash;”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hold!” barked Tallien, watching from the cool shade.  “Mind that tongue of yours, you churl!  It is <i class="calibre3">‘Lady Emilie’</i> to you!  A proper dame and your superior officer, she is!  Know your place!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Pardon my offence, Mareschal,” I corrected myself.  “Lady Emilie, by your leave.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…Wha…”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie was left utterly aghast.</p><p class="calibre10">Well, let’s not pretend this sort of thing was never on the horizon.  It was a snake of a sneaking suspicion, stalking me from the moment I knew Emilie and I were assigned to the same brigade.</p><p class="calibre10">The leadership of the Order&mdash;all within were made well-privy to the particulars of each and every one of us recruits.  That much is certain.  And perhaps just as certain was this: there was meaning to this farce.  A meaning in having me bend the knee to Emilie, my former fiancée of all people.</p><p class="calibre10">Savouring some sadism upon the man ungraced, maybe?  They certainly had the sort of authority to indulge in such ill&mdash;with impunity, no less.</p><p class="calibre10">What looks Raakel and Sheila were giving were not known to me, but there did I spy a slight smirk leaking from Tallien’s lips.  And for his part, Gerd wrung his face full-wroth, only to relax it to a glare of disdain in the next.</p><p class="calibre10">“Now have at it,” he ordered after a scoff.  “Aim where you please, it matters little.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Aye, sir,” I complied.  “Commencing.”</p><p class="calibre10">I rushed forth and swung my sword down in a diagonal arc, targeting the tip of Emilie’s shoulder.  But in the course of it, the blade stopped just a digitus shy of its mark.</p><p class="calibre10">I knew it then.</p><p class="calibre10">The “paling”&mdash;what Gerd was harping on about.</p><p class="calibre10">There was no recoil, no sense that said my sword struck aught material, as against a wall or a plate of armour.  Rather, it felt as if some pliant force, soft but unstoppable, wrapped itself about the blade and stopped its cutting course.  Feeling for myself this unseen armour through my weapon, I soon realised: there was no way I could penetrate such protection.</p><p class="calibre10">Then, in that same moment was I thrown back clear through the air, asudden and without warning.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Gagh…!?”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Down into the dirt I crashed, tumbling and rousing a wild plume of dust.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf!?” Emilie screamed.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Hah… hagh… gah, agh…!”</i> I was laid low, face down, flat on the ground, with a hand clenched to my chest.  Air left my lungs in great chaos as I struggled to rectify my breathing.  All whilst heat and pain wove together and gripped my whole body&mdash;a feeling of having my nerves torn out and laid bare.</p><p class="calibre10">My vision convulsed.  Only through sheer conviction could I train it forth, that I might espy the assailant source.</p><p class="calibre10">And there did I find Gerd.</p><p class="calibre10">Half-turned to me, in his hand, a sword held in a slighting dangle.  That was no pose, no stance: he had but swung the weapon on a whim whence he stood.  A simple and uncaring motion, abruptly imbued with enough force to toss me back like some toy.</p><p class="calibre10">“See that, Emilie?” he said.</p><p class="calibre10">“Gerd!  Rolf, he’s&mdash;!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hush,” he interrupted.  “The lecture’s not over.”</p><p class="calibre10">Indeed, Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">Listen well.</p><p class="calibre10">Just as I will.</p><p class="calibre10">For I need this knowledge, this strength.  Every last drop of it, that I might earn another step closer to knighthood.</p><p class="calibre10">It’s the very reason why I’m here.</p><p class="calibre10">“That scum’s sword.  It stopped before it met your body.  Why?  Well, you’ve the paling to thank.  Silver armour accords this magicked protection even to parts of your person unprotected by its plates.  That is its very purpose: to provide you with an all-encompassing bulwark.”</p><p class="calibre10">With his sword now set upon his shoulder, Gerd continued on in dramatic fashion.</p><p class="calibre10">“On the other hand, a magicked strike against an unmagicked mark yields the sorry sight before you&mdash;scant more than a flick of my sword-wrist showed us how well the clown cartwheels!”</p><p class="calibre10">Gerd spoke the truth: his unannounced interruption was hardly what one would call an  “attack”.  Yet even then, I was sent hurtling back&mdash;easily so.  Were his sword not dulled, that moment certainly would’ve been my last.</p><p class="calibre10">“Now Emilie, a quick quiz,” Gerd went on.  “What happens, then, if magicked sword met magicked armour?”</p><p class="calibre10">“W-what…?  I&mdash;”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie’s eyes teetered on the verge of tears as they darted back and forth between Gerd and me.  A kind soul she is, truly, to sooner wish to have me seen to by a surgien than resume this farce of a lesson.  But a lesson it was regardless, one she could ill-afford to ignore.  To do so was anathema to her standing.</p><p class="calibre10">Ultimately, her worries were unwarranted: I’d escaped with only abrasions and bruises, the sort no surgien would humour.</p><p class="calibre10">“Fret not, Emilie.  I made sure not to end him,” said Gerd.  “But the hour-sand flows, and I would hear your answer.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Er… I-I don’t know.”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">Depends on the prowess of each party,</i> I silently assumed.</p><p class="calibre10">“The side that yields the most odyl wins, Emilie.  But one does not win purely by strength of odyl, no.  Train enough and you’ll soon find yourself weaving greater magicks for both offence and defence.  Understood?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Y-yes…”</p><p class="calibre10">“That said, your store of odyl is the hand that plays the checkmate, all things considered.  Now do you see why you are as a queen-piece to us, Emilie?”</p><p class="calibre10">So, a gap in prowess can be bridged through sheer output of odyl.  I see.  The odyl one attains at the Roun of Orisons is forever immutable in its capacity.  It follows, then, that to be gifted with a large store of it affords one a vast and inviolable advantage.</p><p class="calibre10">“Right then.  Take to heart all I’ve taught you, Emilie.  We quit here for the day,” said Gerd.  “Your very first session and already you’ve come this far&mdash;quite impressive, I must say.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Thanks… Gerd.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Apply yourself well, Emilie,” remarked Tallien.  “I expect wondrous things from you.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Thank you, Mareschal.  I will.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And eh…” trailed Tallien, turning to me, “…’Rolf’, was it?  I name you Emilie’s swain.  Serve her well from here on out, will you?”</p><p class="calibre10">As I thought.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Aye, sir.”</p><p class="calibre10">I was now somehow back on my feet, with my breathing settled enough to form a coherent reply.</p><p class="calibre10">“What!?  Wait&mdash;” exclaimed Emilie.  “Why Rolf?  And why a swain, for <i class="calibre3">me?”</i></p><p class="calibre10">All recruits start their lives in the Order as swains to more senior knights&mdash;that is, were they not anomalies like Emilie.  At the same time, the knightly number naturally outcounts the recruits’, so it would be untrue to say that all knights have a swain of their own.  That a fledgling like Emilie be allowed one, however, was a worthy warrant for suspicion.</p><p class="calibre10">“It is the knight’s duty to show his swain the workings of chivalry,” Tallien explained to a confounded Emilie.  “As for you, young lady.  What better swain for a fledgling dame such as yourself, than a wingless chick like him?”</p><p class="calibre10">Truly, words as curt as they were cutting.  One would find no blame in asking why Emilie be allowed a swain to begin with.  An effort, I fear, that finds no borne fruit.  That hardly stopped Emilie, however.</p><p class="calibre10">“S-sir!  With all due respect, a swain for me would only be needless trouble, then!  For his part, Rolf stands to gain more as swain to ano… another…”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie’s voice trailed into silence.  For her, a dark realisation, finally setting in: under another knight, what awaited me was nothing better than oppression, unchecked and unchallenged.  Only, I wouldn’t have hesitated to suffer such a fate if serving Emilie proved too much a strain upon her heart.  But alas.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Nay…” she surrendered, “…I see now.  Pardon my outburst, Mareschal.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You know each other well enough, yes?  See to it that he does not stray from his corral,” sneered Tallien, then turning to me once more.  “And I trust you have no qualms?  I made myself loud and clear&mdash;enough that a wastrel like you should understand.”</p><p class="calibre10">“None, sir,” was my immediate and unquestioning answer.</p><p class="calibre10">“You will maintain her equipment, tend to her steed, keep tidy her chamber, and&mdash;well, the list goes on, really,” explained the mareschal.  “Do devote yourself to her and your duties, will you?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Aye, sir.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…”  Sorrow shaded Emilie’s face.</p><p class="calibre10">And so it was that I was assigned to the Owlcrane Brigade as swain to my former fiancée.</p><p class="calibre10">Forgive me, Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">There’s nowhere else I can go, naught else I can do but suffer this place and wager my lot upon my sword.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">My days as Emilie’s swain were now in full swing.</p><p class="calibre10">I would leave bed before the first light of day, and with sword in hand, make my way to the rear of the headquarters building.  There, I would commit myself to some training before the day’s duties begin in earnest, as they occupied much of my daytime hours.  Loath was I to make use of the training grounds, for those that would take umbrage were not few in number.</p><p class="calibre10">Vertical swings, downward, upward.  Horizontal swings, leftward, rightward.  Slanting slashes.  Leaping cleaves.  With each swing of the heavy iron sword, I would further refine the arc of its travel.</p><p class="calibre10">The other officers were not wont to trouble themselves with these sorts of drills.  For my part, I felt it of special import to assimilate these techniques as much as I could, thus I’ve committed to this training unfailingly since my smaller days.</p><p class="calibre10">The sun would peek above the horizon to find both beads of sweat dotted all about my body and my arms weary of raising themselves any further.  With the new dawn signalling the end of morning practice, I would wash up by the well before proceeding to the stables.</p><p class="calibre10">There, I would groom Emilie’s horse and prepare its breakfast of grasses and other ruffage.  Afterwards, a walk around the equine corral was in order, and as well, a cleanup of the horse’s stall.  With that job done, the time would be ripe to finally head to Emilie’s chamber.  Punctuality was paramount: I would stand by her doorstep, ready to receive her as she began her own day.</p><p class="calibre10">“A good morrow to you, Lady Emilie,” I saluted as she opened the door.</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh, g-good morning, Rolf,” Emilie stumbled.  “Right… here, if you may.”</p><p class="calibre10">To me, she presented a sword in its scabbard&mdash;a spare, different from the one slung at her hip.</p><p class="calibre10">“As you wish.”</p><p class="calibre10">Carrying it was the duty of a swain, which I obliged.</p><p class="calibre10">From there, Emilie’s own daily commitments would commence, with me ever at her side, whether it be behind her during meetings, or at the fringes of the training grounds during practice.  In times when she was out on horseback, it would be my charge to pull the mount afoot.</p><p class="calibre10">“S-say, Rolf!  You’ve been on your feet all this while.  How does a breather sound?” Emilie suggested from atop her horse.  “One in the shade, under those trees yonder, perhaps…”</p><p class="calibre10">“My feet are fine, my Lady,” I declined.  “Our docket dictates that we return to base before nightfall after inspecting the western front.  If taking respite is not itself an order, then I should like to continue on as we are.”</p><p class="calibre10">“All… all right.  Let’s keep at it, then…”</p><p class="calibre10">Handling documents also counted amongst Emilie’s duties.  Here, too, at her desk in her chamber, I would standby at her side. As she was a freshly knighted officer, her workload was purposefully light, with filing simple reports composing the brunt.  However, the other side of the proverbial coin has her minted as an executive officer, and thus did she busy herself in browsing through papers related to sundry aspects of the Order’s administration.</p><p class="calibre10">It seemed much of what was scribed therein would escape her comprehension, if her peppering of quizzical questions was aught to go by.  In response, I would offer both explanations as needed and insight on how best to approach various subjects.</p><p class="calibre10">“For this particular case, the mareschal must first be informed that budgetary documents will be sent back to the commissariat.  There, will the value discrepancies be corrected.”</p><p class="calibre10">“But from what I could tell, the previous budget had just about the same discrepancies, no?” questioned Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">“My Lady, the Order is currently in the midst of settling its accounts; it won’t do to go about it this time as we did last, lest we risk affecting the draft proposals to be sent to Central.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Uh… mm… so, in other words…?”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie was in the habit of furrowing her face and fretting about aught her wits couldn’t stomach.  But a dose of digestible explanations, patiently administered, was all it took for her to figure it out in the end.</p><p class="calibre10">Taking care of Emilie’s equipment was also amongst my duties.  Her sword required sharpening only once in a while.  Her armour, on the other hand, proved the greater nuisance.  As needs demanded, I would repair any dents along the plates, reupholster the leather, or reapply oil upon its many surfaces.</p><p class="calibre10">“R-Rolf, the parts ‘round the belt end up scuffing themselves rather quickly,” Emilie observed.  “It must be tiring, replacing them so often.  I won’t pay a mind if you ease up on their care.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m afraid that won’t do, my Lady.  At all times must armour be kept in the best possible condition; your very life may depend on it.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I… I suppose you’re right.”</p><p class="calibre10">When the day’s duties were done with, I would request permission from Emilie to receive her the next day as per usual.  No paperwork was involved&mdash;mere verbal permission sufficed.  Nonetheless, this step was indispensable if I aimed to do my job properly.  And for good reason: her chamber was housed within the main building’s third floor.  It was there that the leadership resided, a place forbidden to any lower officer who had not the requisite allowance.  As Emilie’s swain, asking for permission ahead of the next day’s duties was in itself a part of the routine.</p><p class="calibre10">“May I receive you at the same time on the morrow, my Lady?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes… I don’t mind…”</p><p class="calibre10">It was in these moments that I would find her eyes downcast.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>

<p class="calibre10">The day was done with.  Tasks fulfilled and with sword in hand, I headed to the rear of the headquarters building.  One more training session, just like the morning’s.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Hah…!  Hah…!  Hah…!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Arcs of swung iron glinted under the moonlight.</p><p class="calibre10">One after another, over and over, on and on&mdash;movements I’ve repeated since childhood.  By now, they must’ve totalled in the hundreds of thousands, if not millions, each executed with the whole of my being.</p><p class="calibre10">Out of a thousand swings unbalanced by uncertainty, ten would be steeled with surety.  From those precious ten come a thousand more, each as adamant.</p><p class="calibre10">With my mind set along the blade up to its very tip, I continued cutting at the air.  The sword arc was given to meandering upon the slightest distraction.  When such thieving thoughts arose, I would start over right from the beginning.</p><p class="calibre10">In my mind, a moon mirrored within the water’s surface&mdash;through the reflection, my sword sailed, disturbing the waters with not the slightest ripple.</p><p class="calibre10">Once again, under a tree amongst flurries of falling leaves&mdash;through the trunk, my sword sliced, touching not a single leaf.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet again, within a vociferous storm&mdash;through the gales, my sword sang, deafening the wind-howls.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf.”</p><p class="calibre10">At once, the chaos inside was stilled.  In my ears, then, was the sound of soft footfalls coming from behind.</p><p class="calibre10">“Do you train here, always?  All on your own?”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie&mdash;upon turning did I find her moonlit mien.</p><p class="calibre10">“My Lady,” I saluted.  “I do, yes.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I see…”</p><p class="calibre10">Silence settled between us.  In that while were Emilie’s lips uncertain.  She then looked to me, as if resolved.</p><p class="calibre10">“Y-you know, Rolf!  The mareschal praised me again!  ‘Another well-writ report,’ he said!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Is that so?”</p><p class="calibre10">“And just the other day, I pointed out a problem in the operations protocol,” she continued.  “‘Quite the eagle-eyed tactician,’ I was told!”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m glad to hear it.”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie fell quiet again, her eyes turning down till their long lashes almost met.  Another wordless moment grew between us.</p><p class="calibre10">“…‘Twas all thanks to you, Rolf,” Emilie started again.  “I made sure the mareschal knew of this, but he… he wouldn’t have any of it.”</p><p class="calibre10">“A fool’s errand, my Lady.  You only risk imperilling your own position.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Still!  ‘Tis by your counsel that I accomplish the things I do.  Even though you’re the one truly deserving of the merit… ever and always.”</p><p class="calibre10">“By rights, a dame garners the merits of her swain,” I reiterated.  “I merely gave my thoughts, nothing more&mdash;the one to put them to practice was you, Lady Emilie.”</p><p class="calibre10">Once more, she fell silent and hung her head sullenly.  After a moment, she seemed to muster up some courage for her next words.</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Lady Emilie’…” she said, almost in a murmur.  “You call me that, even now.”</p><p class="calibre10">“As I must.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Must you really?  When ‘tis but the two of us…?  ‘Twould ease my heart if we can share warmer words like we once did.”</p><p class="calibre10">“The walls may have ears, I fear.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I know… I know, but…”</p><p class="calibre10">Sorrow veiled Emilie’s face&mdash;an expression I’ve witnessed more times than I dare admit ever since we’ve joined the Order.  And I was the cause of them all.  Emilie, once my fiancée, whom I once gave the promise of happiness&mdash;a promise now paid instead with sadness, from whose purse but my own.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…  The other swains don’t address their knights with such ceremony.  Why is it only you that must do this…?”</p><p class="calibre10">“The Order compels me so.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Compels you so…?  Rolf, we’re hardly wanting of stablehands, yet you’re made to groom my horse!  We’re in no battlefield, yet always are you burdened with my spare sword!  Why is that…!?  None of it makes sense!  Does it sit well with you, Rolf!?  Surely it can’t…!”</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie’s eyes, lovely as they were, issued tears one after another.  Tears brimming blue beneath the moonshine.  I came up close to her, and with a hand softly upon her cheek, wiped them away.  Her azure gaze was wide as I stared resolutely into it.</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie.  It doesn’t&mdash;not in the slightest.  I’m bitter of it all, just as well.  But it hurts me so much more to make you cry.  Thus I bear it.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m sorry, Emilie.  Truly.  I’ve troubled you to no end, whether by our broken betrothal or the daily hardships of our new lives here.”</p><p class="calibre10">“That’s not…  I…”</p><p class="calibre10">“But there’s… there’s <i class="calibre3">nothing</i> left for me.  Not anymore.  Naught, save a dream of knighthood.”</p><p class="calibre10">With eyes upon her, unwavering, I quietly yet resolutely continued on.</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie.  Ungraced as I am, there’s nowhere for me to go.  What else can I do then?  What, but stay here and endure?  And so I do.  On and on, till toil’s end, someday far 	away, where I’m made a knight&mdash;just like I’ve always dreamed.  And there will I find vindication; this, I believe.  Selfish words, I know&mdash;to you, words empty of solace, but full only of sorrow.  Yet this is the path I must walk.  There’s no other way.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh, Rolf…”</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie… I’m sorry.”</p><p class="calibre10">With that, she rubbed her cheeks free of their sobbing strain, and turned her eyes up to me once more.</p><p class="calibre10">“No…  I’m sorry, too, Rolf.  After all, you’re…”</p><p class="calibre10">Yet those eyes, once dried of tears, now flowed with them anew.</p>
<p class="calibre10">“…You’re… you’re the one… who’s been suffering the most…”</p>

<p class="calibre10">Emilie wept.</p><p class="calibre10">Through the moonlit emptiness, her wailing woes echoed&mdash;a sound that wounded me more deeply than any abuse from my superiors ever had.</p><p class="calibre10">Is a man ungraced so incapable?  That a mountain of his efforts moves not even a girl’s lips to a smile?</p><p class="calibre10">I searched up to the benighted sky, haunted by a feeling that has hounded me ever since my arrival: an aching resentment at my own naïveté.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Rraah!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Iron rushed in a blur.</p><p class="calibre10">The sideways slash of a sword, aimed right at my front&mdash;a dodging defence here beats a block, setting up a prime position for a reprisal.</p><p class="calibre10">And so I committed, backing off by a half-pace.  Across my chest swept the sword, slicing only air.  Immediately thereafter did I lunge forth, closing the distance to my opponent.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ach!?”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Till this point, too taken was he with the midrange high-guard.  The habit stood uncorrected, for sure enough, faced with the now-shrunken gap between us, he attempted to retreat to the back-right, all to reassume the high-guard.</p><p class="calibre10">But it was an attempt well-predicted: I stuck close to him, planting my left foot down where he meant to put his right.</p><p class="calibre10">“Wha&mdash;!?”</p><p class="calibre10">His posture crumbled once his footwork failed him.  A fight this close up often devolves into a struggle of securing positions of advantage.  To gain the upper hand, one could control the opponent’s own footwork by merely denying him useful ground.</p><p class="calibre10">With my own opponent in disarray, I rammed the hilt of my sword into his abdomen, sending him tumbling into the ground.  Seeing him defenceless and flat on his back, I trained the tip of my blade to his neck.</p><p class="calibre10">“…I yield,” he scowled.  The onlookers stirred.</p><p class="calibre10">“Bloody hell, that ungraced bloke won again.  Can you believe that?  Against Nicolai, no less!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Still your steed, won’t you?  ‘Twas but a fluke, surely!”</p><p class="calibre10">“You don’t pull off flukes with finesse of that sort, I’d say.  See how he moved?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Eh, well.  A man scarcely needs Her grace to wag a sword, anyhow.”</p><p class="calibre10">A whole year had passed since I’d joined the Order.  Still a swain, I had joined with members of another brigade for sword practice that day, a session that found none of the Owlcranes present.</p><p class="calibre10">Even without odyl, it was here that I can prove my prowess.  Overwhelming opponents as I just had was earning me some recognition, scant though it may be.</p><p class="calibre10">My opponent, this “Nicolai”, then jerked up to his feet and returned to the wall of spectators.  In his place, another man.  His own feet stepped with a clank absent from the rest.</p><p class="calibre10">“My turn to measure swords with you,” he said.</p><p class="calibre10">“…As you wish,” I accepted.</p><p class="calibre10">The lieutenant of the 2nd Cavalry Brigade, if memory serves.  As proof, he came equipped with silver armour and a snide smirk on his face.  Taking our positions, we stared each other down.</p><p class="calibre10">“Now… begin!”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ssyah!”</i> I roared right upon the referee’s call, bolting straight into the lieutenant’s midst.  My blade sailed up from a low guard, its arc intent upon his shin.</p><p class="calibre10">“Mm…?” he muttered, void of any bodily reaction.</p><p class="calibre10">Only, the attack failed&mdash;the blade stopped short of his shin.  I plucked my weapon back and wound my way to my opponent’s side.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Dyah!”</i> came my full-spirited shout, right in line with an oblique downward swing.</p><p class="calibre10">This, too, was stayed from striking its mark.  The lieutenant: hardly a glance of his ever saw my sword.  I pulled back.  In the next sliver of a moment, I closed right back in with a thrust of my blade, its tip imbued with the momentum of my entire being.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Yyagh!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">The same result: the sword tip halted just before the lieutenant’s chest.</p><p class="calibre10">He glanced down.  “…Heh.”</p><p class="calibre10">Next came his own attack: a rising slash from his lower right.  I skirted it by a wide margin.  The lieutenant clicked his tongue, disappointed.</p><p class="calibre10">I quickly rushed back in again.  From the high guard, I propelled my sword into an exact cut down the centre.  Again was it stopped, a hair’s width from his head of hair.  Seeing this, my opponent answered: a sword-swing into my side.</p><p class="calibre10">Immediately, I tugged my blade back to guard against the attack.  Only, silver-forged like his armour, the lieutenant’s blade was suffused with odyl.</p><p class="calibre10">Our swords met.  A burst of ethereal force drove itself into my body, blowing me back.  The end of the flight saw me crashing onto the ground, tumbling two times, perhaps three.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Gegh… hah… khagh…!”</i> My lungs reeled from the impact.  My ears rang, but through the high hum, I heard my opponent’s voice.</p><p class="calibre10">“Too busy panting to call your own defeat, eh cur?” he fleered.  “Well, I’ll leave you to lick your wounds, then.”  Back into the crowd he went.  Quite satisfied with himself, I suppose.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Kh-hach… hah… hakh…!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Ungraced flesh wrung taut by odyl.  A body entirely assailed by heat, pain, and vertigo.  Organs shuddering, as if they’d been twisted and rearranged&mdash;all sensations I have the sole privilege of knowing.  I writhed there, flat on the ground, agonising.  Jeering laughter wormed its way into my ears.</p><p class="calibre10">“The pup sure barked his hide off, I’ll give him that.  Begs the question, though: doesn’t he realise his sword’ll never reach its mark, at least?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Realise?  Hah!  I’d wager he’s too muscle-pated for the arduous thought!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Vacuous of odyl lore, he is, perhaps?  Certainly a possibility with an ungraced, I would think.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Whoa&mdash;! Aha hah ha!  A mite too sad an’ sorry, if that be the way of it!”</p><p class="calibre10">In the midst of burgeoning chuckles and chortles, I dragged myself up to my feet with the support of my sword.  Before me stood yet another man.</p><p class="calibre10">“Why ‘allo there, mate!  Er, ‘Molf’, was it?  I’m next, if ye don’t mind!” he said.  There, too, was silver in his armour.</p><p class="calibre10">“Look ‘ere, it’s Max!  Oh, this’ll be a sight!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Max, it’s not Molf&mdash;it’s <i class="calibre3">‘Holf’.</i> Come on, now!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Well, weren’t we a saintly lot!  Helping ungraced here with his training an’ all.  Oi!  Holf!  Better thank us proper, y’hear?!”</p><p class="calibre10">Submerged in their ceaseless heckling, I suppressed the pain throbbing through my entire body.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Kuh, hah…”</i> My breathing had yet to stabilise.  Nevertheless, with sword in hand, I readied my stance and faced my new opponent.  “…En… en garde.”</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>

<p class="calibre10">“Right, lads and lasses.  Training’s over.  Suppertime nears; get moving to the mess hall for your share.”</p><p class="calibre10">The crowds started to empty upon the call for training’s end.  I was down to my knees, battered and bruised all over, as fellow officers strolled on by, busy in their jeering and jabbering.</p><p class="calibre10">The laughter, the footfalls, all soon faded into the distance.  Left alone, I then struggled back up to my feet and began trundling my way out of the training grounds.  That is, until I found standing before me a girl I knew well.  Hair of flowing night, eyes of quiet roses&mdash;Felicia.</p><p class="calibre10">“Dear Brother…” she softly called.</p><p class="calibre10">The fates’ humour ever harries, for unlike myself, Felicia had received a proper share of odyl from her own rites at the Roun of Orisons.  Indeed, a rather astounding amount, if I recall, though not as extraordinary as Emilie’s.  And just as promised, she had enlisted in the Order earlier this year.</p><p class="calibre10">“Felicia,” I called back.  “You saw?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I did…  Brother, you’re hurt…”</p><p class="calibre10">“No.  I’m quite all right.  Be not so glum, Felicia.  The wounds sting less than they look,” I assured my sister, forcing a smile.  A futile one, for her spirits remained unbrightened.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yet it wounds me… to ill-weave a single mending magick.  If only…” she lamented.</p><p class="calibre10">“No need to trouble yourself.  Already you’re committed to the battle magicks, anyhow.  Am I wrong?”</p><p class="calibre10">If memory serves, Felicia was assigned to the 1st Sorcery Brigade, distinct from its other two counterparts for its focus in the attacking magicks.  A perfect match, as I’d heard Felicia to be highly attuned to such spells.</p><p class="calibre10">At one point, the Order was abristle with rumours that she had&mdash;upon learning the Globus Igneus spell during her very first training session&mdash;produced a fireball no less than thrice the girth that of her instructor’s own.  Little wonder, then, that her outstanding talent often astounded her peers during practice.</p><p class="calibre10">“A matter, Brother, if I may?” she asked.</p><p class="calibre10">“What is it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Those… spars earlier.  You were so adamant in cutting down your mark.  But… why?  If I may ask?  Had you assayed a different course, surely you would’ve emerged less harmed…”</p><p class="calibre10">It seemed even my sister found my methods wayward.  Who could blame her?</p><p class="calibre10">Repeatedly slashing at my opponents with all my might, knowing full well that none of the swings would land&mdash;what came of such efforts, other than ire and mockery from my peers, and the injuries now riddling my body?  Nevermind that.  I even had the gall to pick myself back up time and again, earning fresher scorn and opponents alike, only to be sent tumbling and turning once more.</p><p class="calibre10">My sister was right: had I tempered my efforts and yielded where I could, I would not have made myself the sorry sight as I was now.</p><p class="calibre10">Only, such was never my intent.</p><p class="calibre10">“Felicia.  I give myself to my sword as you do to your magicks,” I explained.  “Only through each and every devoted swing can my technique improve.  Had I yielded even in this, what point, then, is there in training?”</p><p class="calibre10">“But to go so far… that you are hurt so…!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hurt I am, of course.  But look: I’m bigger than most, yes?  And all the tougher for it.  You needn’t worry,” I reassured her.</p><p class="calibre10">In the year since I’ve joined the Order, I’ve grown taller still.  Being incapable of magicks afforded me precious free time, which I devoted to physical training&mdash;not only in technique, but also in building bulk.  By now, I already possessed the largest figure in the entire Order.</p><p class="calibre10">“Is there…” Felicia began again.</p><p class="calibre10">“Hm?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Is there meaning, then…?  In going as far as you do?” she asked carefully, eyes shaded, with a voice that verged on fading into a whisper.</p><p class="calibre10">Such a question was formed in pure earnest&mdash;wrung from a troubled heart left utterly spent at the end of much deliberation and anxiety.  Felicia’s words, though faint in sound, were flush with intent.</p><p class="calibre10">The Nafílim cannot be fought without odyl.  That much is undeniable.  Bereft of it, a sword will never reach its mark, no matter how swiftly, how strongly, how keenly it is wielded.</p><p class="calibre10">Why was it, then, that I continued to brandish my sword till I was beaten and brought low?  Why keep upon a path promising naught?  Where is the meaning in it all?</p><p class="calibre10">This was Felicia’s secret, precious worry for her own brother, whom she could not bear seeing so hurt.  Doubtless she was told by our parents to never come near me.</p><p class="calibre10">Only, like Emilie, she was a girl too kind for such coldness.</p><p class="calibre10">“Of meanings… I’m afraid I know none, Felicia.  In fact, I feel it very likely there to be none, even.  But I also feel, Felicia, that in brandishing the blade to the very end, it&mdash;I can reach some place, someday.  There’s nothing left to me save this one belief,” I explained to Felicia, staring unwaveringly into her eyes.  “But of certainties, I know one: were both my blade and I made to stop, we would reach nothing and nowhere at all.”</p><p class="calibre10">“But, Brother, that’s…”</p><p class="calibre10">Likely, my answer gave Felicia no solace.  I must admit, I, too, feel myself beyond all help.  But such was my lot and my resolve.  Though I may be made a laughing stock or a pariah, there was little else I could do but have faith that there was meaning in nurturing that very resolve.</p><p class="calibre10">“Let it lie for now, Felicia,” I said.  “It’s almost supper.  Shouldn’t you be on your way?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Y… yes, I suppose I should,” replied Felicia.  “Will you join me?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m afraid I can’t.  Supper comes later for me.  Go on ahead and tuck in with your brigade mates, Felicia.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…Yes, Brother.”</p><p class="calibre10">There was peril in consorting like we did.  I knew not how rife the Order was with the eyes and ears of our parents, and so for the longest while, I had been keeping my distance as well as I could.  Little did I care of what ill would befall upon me should the worst transpire, but for Felicia’s sake, I was loath to chance casting any shadow upon that bright future of hers.</p><p class="calibre10">“I’ve done little but hurt you, haven’t I, Felicia…?” I whispered to myself, looking on as my sullen sister walked away.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">At day’s end, I would throw myself into bed and simply let my thoughts sink into the deep dark.  Sleep comes to me like death, abyssal in its fathoms, where even dreams are undone unto naught.</p><p class="calibre10">But this night was a peculiarity.</p><p class="calibre10">Out of that bottomless eigengrau of slumber came a vision&mdash;a murky moment from my younger days.  Within that dream, I was yet a tiny boy, drowning myself in a stack of books at the Buckmann manor study.  A pastime of mine in those distant days, to steep myself in that palace of books and lose myself to literature.</p><p class="calibre10">And of all the stories I devoured, the most palatable were the tales of knights.</p><p class="calibre10">Souls with sword in hand, wagering their very lives for King and Country&mdash;from that vivid image was I enlightened of my raison d’être, one that emboldened me by no small degree with its sheer palpability.  Humouring myself with notions of life’s purpose was indeed quite precocious of me, I admit, but that was, unabashedly, the kind of kid that I was.</p><p class="calibre10">I’d spent my life fenced in by the expectations of my family as they groomed me to be their next master.  Perhaps it was in that confinement that I simply longed for a reason of being.  Not that it really mattered anymore&mdash;those fences, those expectations, all of them now laid in shambles, after all.</p><p class="calibre10">But within that dream was I a boy utterly mesmerised as I quietly read a particular book: this one a collection of sonnets, penned a few decades ago by a courtly poet, singing of the knight’s heart and human condition.  Of a different sort it was from my favourites, but I indulged in it hungrily nonetheless.</p><p class="calibre10">I’d also partaken well of works rich with war stories, and by their influence, came to consume as much as I could annals and manuals of the military sort.  But in the end, it was genuine chivalric literature that most sated my cravings.</p><p class="calibre10">“How about… you… then!”</p><p class="calibre10">I reached for another, having just finished the poems.  But for the little boy that I was, retrieving books shelved ahigh was an olympian trial in and of itself.  Up the ladder I would go, stretching and stretching as far as I could to take my next target.</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh!  Well hallo there, friend!”</p><p class="calibre10">Freshly caught was a copy written by a beloved author of mine.  Truly what I was hoping to chance upon: an authentic knightly tale.  With great enthusiasm did I crack open its pages.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Whoa…”</p><p class="calibre10">A story that sang a spring shower of praises upon a certain knight’s way of life&mdash;to it, I gave myself, letting slip from my mind the passing of the hours.  The words wove visions of a man of magnanimous yet lonely pride, who parted his homeland with sword in hand, was knighted in the far courses of his path, and fought for his folk with the whole of his soul.</p><p class="calibre10">Such a storied life I lived for myself from the warmth and comfort of that manor study.</p><p class="calibre10">Finishing the fable, I flew to my feet and snatched a feather duster from a nearby bookshelf.  The puffy thing was now my sword, keen and ready to sail through the air, which I eagerly obliged.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Yah!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">A slash and a swing of the feathered sword here and there, over and under.  I was a knight, a tenacious and noble-hearted swashbuckler of a knight.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Rrah!  Yyah!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">As the duster dusted about, that runt of a Rolf made an oath: to study and serve the sword.  But of course he did.  Mastering the sword to perfection was part and parcel of being a knight, and the story I’d just read spoke no differently.</p><p class="calibre10">In it, the knightly warrior bolted straight at his opponent, striking the latter’s forearm with his blade.</p><p class="calibre10">Inspired, I attempted the same.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Dyah!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">But I was overmuch the clumsy and fumbling little fool.  Try as I might, I could not become just like that storied knight.  Annoyed, I twisted and twirled that duster of a dirk once more, over and over.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Yah!  Hya…</i> Eh?”</p><p class="calibre10">With my wits back in their roost, I noticed a little girl standing right by my side.  Her smile beamed more brightly than the afternoon sun setting behind her.</p><p class="calibre10">“…E-Emilie!”  Embarrassment struck like lightning.  I quickly hid the duster behind me&mdash;belatedly so, of course.  “You weren’t here for long… were you?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I was!  Since you started on that book!”</p><p class="calibre10">“What!  Could’ve said something, you know!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Maybe, but I wanted to watch you some more,” Emilie smiled further, warmly and with hale.  In the face of such mirth, I could hardly help but smile myself.</p><p class="calibre10">And just like that, the dream drifted away.  The burning noonlight faded back into the black of pre-dawn.</p><p class="calibre10">Without a word, I continued laying there upon my bed, staring up at the cavernous ceiling of the Order barracks.  After whiling for a moment, I got up.  All the other men around me were still deep in their slumber.</p><p class="calibre10">Taking my sword, I quit the sleepy place, heading outside for my morning training.  Yet another day was about to start.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>

<p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Dyah!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">With a shout, I bolted straight at my opponent and struck his forearm with my blade.  Yielding a low yelp, he left his own sword to clamour upon the ground.</p><p class="calibre10">“…I give.”  A quiet resignation, accompanied by a scowling gaze thrown my way.  The onlooking officers buzzed.</p><p class="calibre10">“Bloody ungraced won again, boys!”</p><p class="calibre10">“They did bugger-all but flap their feders.  What were you expecting, man?  If magicks entered the fore, he’d be squashed like a roach, he would!”</p><p class="calibre10">“The bloke’s no slack with the sword, you have to admit.  Could do to learn a thing or two from ‘im…”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yeah, bright idea there, mate.  Perhaps he can teach you how to sew shut that wayward mouth of yours too, eh?”</p><p class="calibre10">Like silver, iron can be infused with odyl.  But make no mistake, for these two metals can’t even compare&mdash;silver, at the end of the day, is foremost amongst all metals as a conductor of odyl.</p><p class="calibre10">A magicked strike from an iron blade is something I can easily chance guarding against, as I would not be blown away so inequitably by it.  But just the same, it was not a risk I could indulge indefinitely.  Though little, odyl yet courses through such strikes, and given enough of them, injury is inevitable.</p><p class="calibre10">Likewise, a paling could be formed through iron armour, albeit with gaps and blind spots.  By repeatedly striking against such protection and finding its weaknesses, it is possible for my blade to bite its mark.  I could therefore put up a fight through my swordsmanship, so long as my opponent is a regular officer, donned with nothing better than iron arms and armour.</p><p class="calibre10">I’d thus far claimed victory in all of my spars for today’s training.  But the taste of victory is as sweet as it is short-lived.  And as if to answer my unease, an executive officer clad in silver emerged from the crowd.</p><p class="calibre10">“Your next dance is with me, lad.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh!  Been waiting for this!”</p><p class="calibre10">“All bets on the lieutenant!  Whip ‘im till he whimpers, good sir!”</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Ey!  Ungraced!  Fun time’s over, y’hear!?  Now’s when the big boys show you how we really play ‘round here!”</p><p class="calibre10">That last line came from none other than my prior opponent.  As expected.  It was routine at this point, really.  Yoná’s cherished children, laying down the hand of judgement upon the cocksure man She’d forsaken.  Poetic justice at its finest, one sure to entertain the gathered officers, riled and foaming at the mouth, as they all were.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>


<p class="calibre10">A shower of sneers and snickers rained down upon me as I laid flat on the ground, defeated.  The image of a man ungraced, blown away like a leaf against a gale&mdash;surely an exotic delight served only from the kitchen that is the 5th Chivalric Order’s school of swordsmanship.</p><p class="calibre10">But no matter how many times I was laid low, now matter how terribly the pain throbbed, my sword never left my grip.  To them, it was both a sight and slight of unfettered stupidity, boldness that merely spurred their inner sadists.</p><p class="calibre10">“What’s this, now?  Look there, still clingin’ to his sword, he is.”</p><p class="calibre10">“He’d sooner part with a sword of a different sort, I’d wager.  What point is he trying to make, really?”</p><p class="calibre10">“What’s wrong, lad?  Licking the dirt brings that sweet a taste to yer tongue, is it?  Well, quit it an’ get up, why don’t ye!?”</p><p class="calibre10">Against the hail of hecklings, I managed to get back on my feet and stand ready with my sword.</p><p class="calibre10">“My turn now, mate.  Let’s have a bit o’ fun, shall we?” said another silver-armoured challenger, coming to the fore.  Stuck to his face was the look of sheer glee.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>

<p class="calibre10">After training was brought to a close, I washed my wounds by the well.  Today, too, saw me terribly torn up.</p><p class="calibre10">The moment brought to mind a peculiar memorandum, one I had found long ago in the study back home at the Buckmann estate.  It was penned by a baron of a foreign land who had developed a taste for suffering&mdash;’masochism’, was it?  Pain of both mind and body turned instead to pleasure for this baron, and the memorandum told of his life in high society as he bore for his own perversion a secret shawl of shame.</p><p class="calibre10">It scarcely held my interest then, and so I read only the start of the story.  Thinking about it now, perhaps I should’ve delved deeper.  I would’ve liked to learn a thing or two from this baron, of how suffering might be of some avail to me.</p><p class="calibre10">As I ruminated on profitless thoughts, a voice chimed from behind.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf.”</p><p class="calibre10">By that point in my time in the Order, I had been conferred the honourable epithets of “ungraced”, “addle-pate”, and “scum”.  One soul, however, yet called me by my name.</p><p class="calibre10">“Emilie, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Those wounds,” she pointed out.  “Are you all right?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I am.  It is no cause for concern.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…I see.”</p><p class="calibre10">A silent pause followed.  By its end, Emilie forced a clumsy smile.</p><p class="calibre10">“Say, Rolf.  ‘Tis been a long while since we last dined together, isn’t it?  Won’t you join me for supper?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, my Lady.  If I may.”</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">“Why, Emilie!  Fine work today, eh?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ey up, Emilie!”</p><p class="calibre10">“We make for the mess hall.  Come and dine with us, Miss Emilie, if it pleases you.”</p><p class="calibre10">As Emilie and I made our way to the mess hall, we chanced upon the other members of the Owlcrane Brigade: Gerd, Raakel, and Sheila.</p><p class="calibre10">“O-oh, all right, then.”</p><p class="calibre10">Joined with new company, we resumed on our way, with Emilie surrounded by the other three and myself not far behind.</p><p class="calibre10">“Congratulations on your promotion, <i class="calibre3">Lieutenant</i> Emilie.”</p><p class="calibre10">“My thanks, Gerd.  Only, I must say, ‘tis an honour wasted on the freshest newcomer.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Easy on the modesty there, m’love,” said Raakel.  “Gotten a gander o’ that grand spellblade o’ yers, we have.  Ye be the strongest o’ us, an’ if I’m honest, havin’ ye lead us is a no-brainer, ain’t it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Can’t disagree there,” nodded Gerd.  “And that’s to say nothing of your tactical wits&mdash;the best amongst us, mind you.  Planning, organising&mdash;the mareschal doesn’t hold back his praises when he sees how sharply you manage our operations.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Y-you know!  I’ve tried telling the mareschal for who knows how many times by now, but Rolf’s been the one charitable enough to give me counsel all this time…” Emilie admitted with an uneasy smile.</p><p class="calibre10">“Miss Emilie.  Honour given is honour earned, no matter how much you have leaned upon your swain for it,” Sheila corrected.</p><p class="calibre10">“S-still!  That we needed a lieutenant to begin with was Rolf’s own suggestion…”</p><p class="calibre10">“Come now, Emilie,” said Gerd.  “Thinking dearly of your swain&mdash;a fine play of virtue, sure.  But I’ll be frank: you coddle that man more than he deserves, and that doesn’t sit well, not with me, at least.”</p><p class="calibre10">“How could you…”  Emilie then turned to me, giving flickering glances with those troubled eyes of hers.</p><p class="calibre10">It does you ill to seek my help, Emilie.  I count myself amongst those that see you fit for the lieutenant’s cape, after all.</p><p class="calibre10">The 5th’s Owlcrane Brigade heretofore did not have a lieutenant position of its own.  Seeing this, I expounded to Emilie a number of reasons as to why our brigade stood to benefit from having a chain of command of its own, which she then relayed to the mareschal himself.  Thus was the lieutenant’s role born, and Emilie the first to assume it.</p><p class="calibre10">‘And you will take up the charge, yes?’ Tallien had said, as if it was custom to thrust responsibility upon the proposers of ideas.</p><p class="calibre10">But if we were to consider it with an eye for aptitude, then Emilie well-seemed the perfect candidate.  Gerd’s faculties of reasoning were slightly wanting; the man played by the book, so much so he lacked the flexibility to think beyond its cover.  Sheila, on the other hand, possessed the composure to view things broadly, but her nature lacked the magnetism of a leader.  And Raakel… well, let’s just say she was more the chess piece and less the player.</p><p class="calibre10">For her part, Emilie had a potent charisma about her, nurtured by an innately charming temperament that earned her no small measure of admiration.  A vital asset for a commanding officer, to be sure.  In fact, I measured her to be capable of someday leading a large host of her own.  Single-handedly, no less.  Not to mention, she possessed quite the affinity for the levin magicks&mdash;very often did she wrest the attention of others during training with her dazzling displays of lightning-ensorcelled swordplay, coupled with her winsome looks all the while.</p><p class="calibre10">In pondering such things, the mess hall now stood before us.  Wafts of aromas, sure to rouse the stomach, had long greeted us down the corridor before our arrival.  My nose predicted stew, the sort bedight with cuts of long-braised lamb.  A feast, I was sure, one most welcome on a cold day such as this.</p><p class="calibre10">“Proper nitherin’, ey!” complained Raakel, as if on cue.  “Cold’s been bitin’ these days.  Ye feel it too, don’t ye loves?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I fear this winter shall not come gently,” Sheila confirmed.  “On mornings of late, I oft find my staff frozen to the fingers’ touch&mdash;oh!  How it startles.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Bloomin’ ‘eck, the mess hall’s no better!” Raakel continued.  “Weren’t always this nippy here, ye think?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Is it now?” questioned Sheila.  “I think it warm quite enough.”</p><p class="calibre10">Where people gather, they air words of the weather.  I suppose there was some truth in that.  By no particular fancy, I found myself lending an ear to the girls’ gossip.</p><p class="calibre10">“Ye pullin’ me leg, Sheila?  Come on, I can’t be the only one shiverin’ here!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Raakel might have a point,” Emilie chimed in.  “‘Twas warmer here up till recently, I feel.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Hm.  Can’t make two ways about it myself,” Gerd added.  “You sure it’s not just the faeries tricking your fancy?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Well, Miss Raakel has barely a scant of fat about her,” Sheila observed.  “It would explain why the cold bites her more bitterly, perhaps.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ah Sheila, ever the unwitting jester,” chuckled Gerd.  “Your japery jabs no less bitterly than the rimey mistrals, what with how <i class="calibre3">unscanted your udders</i> are.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Tempt my wrath, do you?” Sheila snapped.</p><p class="calibre10">“How about you, Rolf?” Emilie asked, turning to me.  It seemed charity compelled her to count me in on their conversation.</p><p class="calibre10">“Soot,” I said, looking further into the mess hall.  “The hearth seems choked with it.  Left as is, I’m afraid it’ll prove a poor shield against the chill.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Soot does that, now?  Why, I didn’t know!”</p><p class="calibre10">“It does indeed, my Lady.  Soot causes the burning of firewood to scantle.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Well then, ungraced.  Be a good yeoman and go clean it right up, will you?” Gerd said nonchalantly.  Looks like the lamb stew would have to wait.</p><p class="calibre10">“W-what?  Why?” questioned Emilie.  “Rolf joins us for supper!  ‘Tis hardly a time for errands.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Housekeeping’s best done before the hour grows late,” Gerd answered.  “Ungraced here has more chores early on the morrow, I’m sure.”</p><p class="calibre10">“But why Rolf, then?  We’re hardly short of housekeepers.”</p><p class="calibre10">Because I’m a swain who can’t fight, of course.</p><p class="calibre10">“Why not?  He’s a swain.”</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Tis no job for a swain!   You know that!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Then what is?  This bloke&mdash;can he fight?  No?  Well then, there’s the rub.  Let’s make him useful, why don’t we?  Give him a job he <i class="calibre3">can</i> do.”</p><p class="calibre10">Lips pouted.  “R… Rolf is my swain and mine alone.  You have no right…”</p><p class="calibre10">This will not do.  We were drawing more eyes than needed.  A shouting match between these two would make Emilie seem the lieutenant over-eager with her newfound authority.</p><p class="calibre10">“I’ll have it done, my Lady,” I interjected.  “Honoured Owlcranes, I bid you all a pleasant supper.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Oho!  We be eatin’ warm tonight,” said Raakel.  “Ta fer that, muscle-pate!”</p><p class="calibre10">“But, Rolf…!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Lady Emilie.  I pay it no mind, really.  Besides, I mislike lamb this time of year; it chews not as tenderly,” I assured her.  “Dine well, my Lady.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ah, Ro…”</p><p class="calibre10">Turning about, I exited the mess hall and made way to the cleaners’ closet.  Perhaps speaking ill of the lamb was foolish of me.  A fox once mocked a cluster of grapes for its sourness, though purely on account of it being beyond the reach of his paws.  In recalling that fable, I surrendered a slight grin.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>

<p class="calibre10">Levity and conviviality suffused the mess hall as those within partook of both hot meals and hale chatter.  Divorced from the merry backdrop was I, about to partake instead of some hearth-cleaning.</p><p class="calibre10">Such menial tasks are hardly a chore, I feel.  In fact, since my earliest days, I’ve been quite taken with them.  In times when my mind is mired in doubt or worry, I would unfetter my heart from the weight of it all and simply give in to a nice round of cleaning.  At the end of it, I would find both my heart and my room as a clear sky after a passing rain.  Wondrous satisfaction, it is.</p><p class="calibre10">People get on in their lives, each taking comfort in a routine that frees them.  Some let loose in culinary pursuits, others simply take a stroll.  For me, keeping things tidy fits the bill.</p><p class="calibre10">Having said that, this would be my first time cleaning a hearth.  Lacking experience, my thoughts turned to the servants back at the Buckmann manor, and all the times I’d watched them busy in their business.  Soot-sweeping, too, was their duty, their methods of which I proceeded to mimic.</p><p class="calibre10">First came clearing out the larger pieces of burnt debris.  I left the ashes for later, once they were in the company of the soot to be scraped from up the chimney.  I then crept into the hearth, taking along a lantern to illuminate the vertical interior.  There, I found layers of soot stuck to the chimney’s inner walls, though they had yet to extend to the portions higher up, thankfully.  Cleaning the lower walls would do just fine, from the look of it.</p><p class="calibre10">After shoving my body further into the chimney, I began brushing off the hanging soot.  Clumps and crumbs of the black stuff dislodged and trickled down.  Quite gratifying, oddly enough.</p><p class="calibre10">With a longer brush in hand, I gave the same treatment to the middle portion of the chimney, bringing my lantern up from time to time to check my progress.  Areas still sooted earned themselves another scrubbing.</p><p class="calibre10">Before long, the chimney found itself well-tidied up.  Worming my way out of it, I turned my attention to the hearth, freeing it from its own fair share of the caking soot.  And when the muck was mostly cleared, I reared out of the hearth to inspect its condition.  Well done so far, if I do say so myself.  A little more brushing, and my job would be finished, but not before removing the soot and ashes collected at the bottom of the hearth.</p><p class="calibre10">By then, the others in the mess hall had mopped up the last of their meals, whiling away the remaining time with tea and chit-chat.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Look there, hey?  An <i class="calibre3">alga,</i> he is…” one amongst them whispered, earning a round of resounding laughter.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">Alga</i>&mdash;that is, the “soot-steeped”.  An unsavoury epithet for the indented who earn their living from soot-sweeping, and in the process, finding themselves absolutely dusted in the dark silt.  Truth be told, I must have seemed the part, soot-steeped as I was.  My face, too, was likely smeared and shaded all over with the stuff.</p><p class="calibre10">The giggles and guffaws failed to relent in the slightest.  One of the onlookers was unabashedly in stitches, clapping and tearing up from the hilarity.</p><p class="calibre10">I began to wonder how Emilie felt in witnessing all this.  Her probable expression was an easy guess; likely she would turn away in sorrow were our eyes to meet.</p><p class="calibre10">Knowing this, I made sure that they didn’t.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">Suppertime was over.  The hour waxed late.</p><p class="calibre10">Under the stars were the winds, the crickets, and the swings of my sword.  As usual, I found myself behind the main building, immersed in the nightly regime.  In the midst of the rigour, there joined a new presence: Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…” she called quietly, “…here.”</p><p class="calibre10">To me was handed a loaf of bread.  That I left the mess hall with naught but the taste of soot upon my tongue seemed a fact not lost upon her.</p><p class="calibre10">“My thanks,” I said, sheathing my sword.</p><p class="calibre10">“A moment, if you can…?”</p><p class="calibre10">Her glance went to the wall.  Sensing her intent, I walked with her, and we were soon sat side-by-side against the cold brickwork.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Rolf, I’m… I’m sorry… for earlier,” she began as I helped myself to the bread.  “…It shouldn’t have happened.”</p><p class="calibre10">“It’s no matter,” I brushed off.  “You’re a lieutenant now.  It’s a precious time; shielding me would be a waste of it.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…’Twas time spent with you that earned me the very promotion, wasn’t it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Not so.  You were promoted precisely because you are fit to play the part.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Still…”</p><p class="calibre10">Following the unfinished thought was a spanning silence.  In its course, I finished the last of the bread, but sensing more to be said from Emilie’s heart, I remained by her side, biding the benighted quietude till her next words.</p><p class="calibre10">“Say, Rolf?” came the broken silence.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, my Lady?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Your nights are always like this, aren’t they?  Spent deep in training?”</p><p class="calibre10">“They are.”</p><p class="calibre10">Morning and night both, that is, but I let it be.</p><p class="calibre10">“Is there some purpose to it… I wonder?”</p><p class="calibre10">Careful words, carrying the same echo as Felicia’s once upon an evening not unlike tonight.</p><p class="calibre10">“I believe there is, yes.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…  I know you to be wise beyond your years.  Forming strategies, managing operations… the sort of affairs that might change the Order from within&mdash;you’d be well off in them, I think.  Just like when you broached the matter of lieutenant to me.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And who would lend their ears, besides you?  The fates have made men deaf to my words, I feel.  They would not brook orders from an ungraced.”</p><p class="calibre10">“The mareschal might not have an ear for your counsel, but for mine, he may…”</p><p class="calibre10">“You are like to find favour in your superiors, my Lady, but I’m afraid they nurture none for me.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Th-that’s not so!  If we can all join hands and spare an ear for each other’s words, then surely…!”</p><p class="calibre10">Insistence most sincere.  There was worry in Emilie’s heart.  A true and deep worry for my pitiful plight, now laid bare.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…  ‘Tis not weakness to set aside the sword, you know.  You can fight your battles from the war-table&mdash;it heeds little of odyl, after all.  Am I wrong?”</p><p class="calibre10">You’re not, Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">Not in the slightest.</p><p class="calibre10">But there’s the rub: what gracious war-table in this Order would leave a seat for an ungraced?  Emilie is most kind to vouch for my ability, but I’m afraid that kindness is hers alone.  Indeed, no other leader would dare humour me.  What reason have they to?</p><p class="calibre10">Questions Emilie likely never asked.  Answers she likely will never know.</p><p class="calibre10">But what’s more, I had no intention of throwing down the sword.</p><p class="calibre10">“Lady Emilie.  Strategy and administration compose a knight’s duties, that much is true.  And I’m glad indeed that my counsel for such has been of some avail to you.  But…” I explained, searching for the next words, “…ever and always has the sword given me purchase.  It is my bedrock; my heart ails to give it up.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…” Emilie said softly.  Her own next words, strained, came with great deliberateness.  “…‘Tis a comforting thought, isn’t it?  That the sword you’ve brandished in days yester will avail you in days yet to come.  Perhaps… <i class="calibre3">too</i> warm a comfort for your heart to part with?  Is that not simply it, in the end?”</p><p class="calibre10">“You may be right.  But not so comforting a thought for my sword itself, perhaps, to be smitten by so troublesome a man,” came my attempt at levity.</p><p class="calibre10">“…I see,” she relented.</p><p class="calibre10">There then lingered another lull between us.  In that wordless while, we both stared up at the sable skies.</p><p class="calibre10">How nostalgic.</p><p class="calibre10">Oft did we take in the tapestry of stars, too, back in our time at the Buckmann barony.  Side-by-side, silent, but secure in our union.</p><p class="calibre10">Only, those moments now all seemed but a distant memory.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf…” Emilie began again.  “My father…  He’s sent word…”</p><p class="calibre10">I looked to her.  “Of what?”</p><p class="calibre10">“…Of a new fiancé he’s chosen for me.”  My gaze fell away from the stars.  Emilie went on.  “‘Kenneth’.  That’s his name&mdash;eldest son to Lord Albeck.  Perhaps you know of them?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I do.  Not more than twelve years of age, isn’t he?  And his father: the master of Albeck viscounty, not far from where we are now.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Mm…  That’s them, sure enough…” she said.  Again, I found myself lacking words.  “I wonder, Rolf…  If you were made a knight, to everyone’s pleasure… then, perhaps…”</p><p class="calibre10">Then perhaps things would be as they once were.  And as planned, I would succeed House Buckmann, and we would wed each other to a happy ever-after.</p><p class="calibre10">An impossible fancy, that.  Such optimism bordered on madness, even.  But the sudden sorrow from realising this for myself broke my heart in half.</p><p class="calibre10">Only, Emilie was desperately clinging on to that same fancy, and by its wiles was she beckoned here on this night, that we might discuss any other path that might lead to its fruition.</p><p class="calibre10">What could I say to her?</p><p class="calibre10">If she were to find happiness at any end, then I would be most content.  Yet, that can’t be the way of it.  I’d be a fool to brush it off with a simple ‘I pray for your happiness’.  I knew such words would be wrong.  I knew it too well.  Yet, I also knew not the right words to say to her.</p><p class="calibre10">Not once have I ever harboured shame in being denied of odyl.  Where shame is to be found is in these moments, when I am empty of any and all words.  Ask any other young man, both betrothed and sixteen years of age&mdash;certainly, he would have an answer prepared.  Any answer at all.  But after scouring my memories with all desperation, I found nothing of avail.  Nothing that might bridge the chasm growing between us.</p><p class="calibre10">Having exhausted my faculties, I gazed intently at the sombre side of Emilie’s face and left my lips to say what they may.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Ever the crybaby, you are.  Even as lieutenant.”</p><p class="calibre10">She turned to me.  “…I’m not crying.”</p><p class="calibre10">“But you are.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’ve shed not a tear.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yet you cry.”</p><p class="calibre10">To this, Emilie fell quiet.</p><p class="calibre10">How cruel can this world be?  If I am to be made a man unblessed, then at the very least, make me also the sole harbour to this fleet of sorrow.  I’d find some way to bear the berth, no matter the enormity.</p><p class="calibre10">Why in the name of all that is good must anyone other than myself be gripped with such grief?</p><p class="calibre10">“My Lady.  You are ever generous in your measure of my worth, but I’m afraid the world shares none of it&mdash;not for an ungraced man like me,” broke I this silence, my eyes firmly fixed on Emilie.  My words might’ve seemed like a bumbling babble, but it was preferable to no words at all.  For her part, Emilie, too, gazed deeply back at me.  “I know little of what lies ahead, but of this I can say: even should I be knighted, inheriting House Buckmann is forever a fleeting fancy.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I… suppose so…”</p><p class="calibre10">“But perhaps the path I tread wends to someplace worthwhile.  I have but to follow and see where it leads.  And perhaps you may be right.  Perhaps swinging this sword over and over again is but a fool’s errand.”</p><p class="calibre10">To this, Emilie stayed quiet, listening intently.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yet, somehow… of this, I’m certain: the point I let go of the sword and renounce my means of fighting back, is the point where that path severs,” came to Emilie words from deep in my chest.</p><p class="calibre10">I felt then that with these words I was also confronting myself&mdash;my weak, pitiful self.</p><p class="calibre10">“As you said, there is comfort in brandishing the blade as I always have, hoping it attains to its purpose someday yet to dawn,” I continued.  “Whether such will come to pass, I cannot know.  But brandish it I must&mdash;this, I believe.  And so long as my belief holds fast, I can’t do aught else.”</p><p class="calibre10">Her lips remained unmoved.</p><p class="calibre10">“Flimsy maunderings of a fool, I know.  But it’s all I have, my Lady,” I admitted.</p><p class="calibre10">“And so it is…” Emilie nodded.  “If that’s your belief, Rolf, then I’ve but to join you in believing.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Lady Emilie…” I said.  “Forgive me.”</p><p class="calibre10">“How silly,” she remarked.  “We’ve done little but seek forgiveness from each other as of late, haven’t we?”</p><p class="calibre10">“…That we have.”</p><p class="calibre10">The two of us gave strained smiles to each other.</p><p class="calibre10">Were they well-given?  Well-received?</p><p class="calibre10">The stars were watching&mdash;what would I say, if they asked of this belief of mine?  Or of the path I’d chosen to tread?</p><p class="calibre10">How essential, how utterly defining the answers surely were.  Sad, then, that I yet knew naught of them.</p>
