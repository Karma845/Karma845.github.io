<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia’s bosom was aboil.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not once could she meet her brother.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Apprised of his absence by the men at Balasthea, Felicia thought then to pay a visit to his abode in Arbel.  But there, too, did her search turn up naught.  Why, she even whiled away the evening in the hollowness of his home, waiting for his return.  And return he did, if only in his sister’s reminiscences of him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Where could he possibly be?  To this moment were the Fiefguardsmen laying their lives on the line, that the people of Arbel might endure in peace.  Yet aface the rigours and sacrifices of the soldiery, what was <i>her brother</i> doing, for his part?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia bit her lip, barely able to leash in her ire and annoyance for her bumbling bloodkin.  Yet a bloodkin he still was, and not before having a word with him did she dare make the journey back home.  For in spite of her misgivings for him, she knew all too well that to abandon him was a blunder beyond all mending.  In fact, it was this very realisation that had roused her to action and brought her to the far march of Ström, all to enquire and know her brother’s mind.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But the days of his absence wore on.  No less than half a week wheeled by, during which Felicia had taken lodging in the fief-burgh.  Today was no different: his residence seemed yet void of its rightful resident.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia rounded the bend on the road to his home, thinking to have a closer look before heading off to visit Balasthea once more.  And there, she at last found someone on the premises—many, in fact.  Fiefguardsmen they were, standing guard about the porch of the residence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">An ill augury gripped her heart at once.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Pardon,” she said to them, “what’s the meaning of this?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;No… inconceivable…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Within the wide spaces of the margrave’s office sounded Felicia’s voice.  Frail though it was, it echoed clean and clear through the stifling stillness.  Many lips were pursed shut: namely those of the Fiefguard leadership, so gathered, too, in that wrung room.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And before them all was the margrave himself, sat at his great desk.  Thoughts and more thoughts thudded in his head, whilst his cheeks and brows were bent in, as though a bitter bug had burst in between his grating teeth.  Oh, bitter indeed, for in a short span had he received many a report, each either most ill or ill-mending his miserable mood.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The very first had come from a Fiefguardsman, freshly fled from Hensen.  His most pained word: “defeat”.  Not long thereafter came a courier from Balasthea.  His stab of a message: “the fort has fallen.”  But that was not all, no, for sighted amongst a Nafílim delegation was the acting commandant himself—the ill-bred and misbegotten ungraced, Rolf Buckmann!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The hours following found the margrave grimly ungiven to ordered thoughts.  And as if the chaos could not be any more mired, there came another man with a tumult of a tiding.  Morten was his name, a footman of the fort, and his words brought new winds to the storm: that the Fiefguard had <i>not</i> failed at Hensen.  Why, it was only feigned to appear that they had, and by whose hand but Rolf the rapscallion!  That ungraced!  There he was, working in the weeds with the Nafílim!  Plotting to trip a trap upon the Fiefguard as they funnelled through the baileys of Balasthea!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">An unexpected turn, no doubt.  But the margrave now had a hard choice of moves to make, each buttressed by reports of two opposing “truths”: of whether his precious Fiefguard was victorious or utterly vanquished.  The decision weighed dearly on him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Inconceivable’?” to Felicia he said, bent with burden upon his chair.  <i>“What</i> exactly, Brigadier?  The failure of my many men?  Or of your brother, who is like to have bedded with those beastlings and brought Balasthea to its knees?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Why, the latter, Your Excellency,” she answered.  “No folly could befoul a Man so, that he be moved to mete treachery upon his own kin.  Wayward may be that brother of mine, but lost to love of our foe?  I should think not.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And yet lost be his wits to Man’s mighty wisdom,” the margrave countered.  “We’ve spoken of this, have we not?  Your brother <i>detests</i> the very divestment of the Nafílim, my dear Brigadier.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“B… but…” she stammered unto silence, scarce able to debate the point.  For somewhere deep in her heart, she felt that—though to do so is most preposterous—her brother might just be enough of an eccentric to treat with the Nafílim.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Your will, m’liege?” asked a Fiefguard commander.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The margrave rubbed his chin.  In actuality, this matter merely pretended at complexity, for it all boiled down to two choices.  In fact, it might as well be but one and a half.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Were it true that the foraying Fiefguard had fallen at Hensen, then it meant a hundred score soldiers were snuffed from the margrave’s military.  Not with sudden frailness could his remnant men ride to meet Rolf’s challenge.  What was left to him was little, then, save to stand fast, speedily replenish his ranks, and mount a desperate resistance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But what of the contrary?  What if his mighty men were, in fact, triumphant at Hensen?  Then it was woe that would await them on their return, with Rolf the wolf ready on the pounce.  About the men would the gates of Balasthea be shut, with showers of arrows and magicks as their homecoming welcome.  An assault inescapable, but not a fate inevitable—were the margrave to accept this scenario as truth, then he had but to sortie his men at once and rout Rolf before the triggering of his trap.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Accept the uncertain doom of his men, or avert their other doom soon and certain to come.  In the end, it was his station as margrave that left Aaron Ström with all but the latter choice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He had reason enough.  The martial milieu of late found mightier momentum in the charge of Men.  The advantage, then, was adamantly the Fiefguard’s—thus it was folly, an affront to reality itself, to fancy so fearsome a force having met its end at the enfeebled fólkheimr.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Sally the soldiery,” the margrave spoke at last.  “Go—bear down upon Balasthea, and break Buckmann and his beastly braves!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such were the lord’s orders.  And sound they were to any right mind, not least to the leaders gathered in the room, who, receipt of the margrave’s mandate, then all filed out of the office.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Only, Felicia yet remained.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In the midst of the shuffle, she turned to the lord.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Excellency, pray lend me leave to march, as well!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The margrave’s gaze narrowed.  “A bloody dagger hides in your brother’s hands, Brigadier.  Yet still you see not its sanguine gleam?  <i>My</i> eyes see his fingers for a foe’s, thus no friend nor family of his ought be given chance to join the charge.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nay—my eyes wish only to see the truth, Your Excellency,” Felicia insisted, “of whether my brother has kept his bonds… or cut them altogether.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not so could he be rotted to his deepest reaches.  Not yet was he withered of all worthiness.  Belief was still his to deserve.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But were it so that his betrayal be true…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Were it so that his wits be broken beyond all repair and redemption…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Were it so that devilry be his new indulgence, that he would dare set his sword upon his family, his former <i>fiancée…</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Myriad emotions now haunted Felicia’s mien.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Feelings of fierce frustration, of wishing dearly to spare her brother a dire death, of… oh, the many sentiments storming in that heart of hers.  Many, yet muddied, missing all distinction and description.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The margrave stared on at her.  A glint was in his eyes—the cold light of intrigue.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Very well, then.  Your leave is lent,” he relented.  “But <i>marching</i> is all you shall do.  This battle be ours and ours alone to wage, Brigadier <i>Buckmann.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Almost gasping, Felicia then curtsied.  “Of course, Your Excellency.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so was decided the sallying of the soldiery from Arbel unto Balasthea, with Felicia to follow the Fiefguard’s file.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────ㅤ♰ㅤ─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">All was tense at Balasthea.  Expectation twanged in the morrowing air, till there came a sentinel’s cry from high up the watchtower.  As if whipped into action, the baileys and battlements both bustled with new activity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It was spotted at last.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Movement—a wriggling buzz flooding from the gates of far Arbel.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I hastily climbed the watchtower.  Peering yonder from the top, I at last knew then that fairer horizons awaited us: the margrave had indeed bitten Morten’s unwitting bait.  And just as I’d hoped, Arbel’s remnant Fiefguardsmen were now marching straight to this fort.  Theirs was the martial mind to smite the Nafílim occupiers of Balasthea, all to stop what they believed to be a pitfall waiting to swallow up their comrades on their return from Hensen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Mm… fifty score, thereabouts?” Lise reckoned their number, having followed me up the tower.  “Their hand’s shown; they’ve played as you predicted, Rolf.  Cull their count here, and the rest unfolds unfraught.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">She had the right of it.  Though it was a large force that had harried Hensen, it did not form the full brunt of the Fiefguard, no.  A lesser number had remained at Arbel, but “lesser” was little comfort, for were we to attack the fief-burgh at this moment, the home advantage would sorely be theirs.  The walls, the cityways, the defences—too much of Arbel would bristle with brutes and ambushes at every corner.  In such a battle, our mettle would most certainly diminish till our unmaking.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What was needed, then, was to drag the Fiefguard out from the safety of their city and sap their strength and numbers before the real deal at Arbel proper.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Would that they keep the hand they’re dealt,” I hoped aloud, taking to hand a longbow and an arrow in preparation, “for long enough, at least.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">From the look of their movements, the Fiefguardsmen fancied a quick, engulfing raid upon Balasthea, with our number forced to stand its ground.  A most sound prediction, if not obvious.  We had all the fort defences at our disposal; surely we should make use of them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet that was precisely why we chose the contrary.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Balasthea’s bulwarks protected it from all sides, indeed, but those very bulwarks had hitherto defended only against Nafílim spears and spells.  Not once have they suffered an attack from <i>Arbel</i> itself.  Yet such was precisely our present predicament, and no one here, not even myself, knew how best to tackle it.  And that’s to say nothing of the braves themselves, who have never before manned this fort’s defences for their own purposes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But all was not lost.  Our plan was to eschew the stronghold’s strengths altogether and strike the Fiefguard out in the open, right as they draw close to our gates.  A long highroad linked both fort and fief-burgh directly, with its course increasingly sheltered by hills and greenery as it neared its terminus.  From such cover would our braves pounce upon the Fiefguard amidst their march and fight them in their confusion.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Timing’s of the essence,” Lise reminded me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Essence and more,” I nodded.  “Only one chance, now.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All caution and concentration were poured into my peering of the enemy march.  Only when their formation was thinnest could we lunge and strike their flanks.  Divide and conquer was our game—bore holes into their file, fragment and drive them to scatter, and cull them in the chaos.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">On and on our watch went, the moments moving like molasses.  The tail of the Fiefguard’s file had long left the vicinity of Arbel, whilst its head had crossed into cutting range of our waylayers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Rolf—the tower quivers,” Lise said at last, alarmed.  “We spring now, or?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nay, not yet.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Indeed, the Fiefguard’s thousand footfalls and hoofbeats were now near enough to subtly rattle the watchtower, and as well, inspire unease in Lise’s voice.  Not that I could blame her; only a scant few braves were to be found in the fort proper; all the rest laid in wait beside the road.  Should the Fiefguard break through, then our situation would turn most sour, to say the least.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still, I dared not let our dire defences nip at my nerves.  Those who live by war ought fear not death—even as it rushes in as a flickering blade upon the flesh.  Of course, never should one neglect to mitigate the risks at hand, but some are as indelible as they are necessary, and they must needs be met with necessary nerve.  Victory otherwise remains forever a fantasy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Mm…”</i> Lise fretted.  “N… now?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I shook my head.  “Just a little closer.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Closer and closer still, a centipede parading down the country path.  That was the Fiefguard, and fast was my stare upon it, waiting and waiting for the exact instant its file was stretched thinnest.  A centipede indeed, barbed and bristly with swords and pennoned spears, creeping its way close.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lise’s frantic eyes flashed to me.  “R-Rolf!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Now!” I shouted.  Rearing back, I nocked the arrow upon the string, drew it taut, and aimed the longbow.  Fingers let loose.  The shaft shot out of sight.  Its target: the sky.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>Ffyyeeuuu──!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The shrill whistle of the signal arrow as it arched through the pale blue.  At once, the Fiefguard collectively flinched and turned their puzzled eyes to the sky.  But not a second sooner, and the Nafílim braves lurched from their lurking spots and lunged upon the Men.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Uwhaakh!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The air filled with the Fiefguard’s screams as their flanks were affrighted by sudden foes.  Theirs was a march mustered at haste; an easy attack upon the fort was their intention, but the very planning of it was put off till they were filed on the field.  Whatever progress they made was for naught: battle was breaking all around them, well beyond both Balasthea’s walls and their expectation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Morten’s words had damned them to their undoing.  For to believe them was to believe that ours was but a force of few.  So it was that none of the Men could have foreseen offence as being our hand in this game.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The lie had too lovely a lustre, looks like,” I said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“They bit the bait for true…” Lise stared in wonder, “&#8230;and leapt right into our bow!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Time and space played to our great advantage.  The set-up, the spots, the springing—all contributed to the cacophony before us all: the Fiefguard’s file was perforated and fragmented, its soldiers sundered and isolated from the formation.  Their screams echoed manyfold.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“B-bloody ‘ell!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Captain!  Your orders!?  Captain!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Fiefguard swords swished and swung in panick.  Nafílim spears stabbed in swift answer.  Steeds neighed and flailed wildly, flinging their riders from their saddles.  The unhorsed Men: unmade by Nafílim hammers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Let not one flee!” Volker’s voice thundered from afar.  “Tine them in, cut them off!  Fight their flanks!  Give them fear!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I thought then just as I had at Hensen: the war-chief truly was a commander of supreme exception.  With him at the helm, the braves battled unbrokenly, all whilst fanning the Fiefguard’s frenzy to pitches higher and higher still.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Impressive,” I thought aloud.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Rolf!  At the gates!”  Lise cried.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I found fast her finger pointing down below.  Sure enough, a detachment of Fiefguardsmen had found their way to the fore of our gates.  In seeking the most opportune timing to mount the ambush, I’d let the point of the enemy file enter striking distance of the fort.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The fault was mine.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But one well-accounted for.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I’ll handle this,” said I, turning away.  “The watch is yours, Lise.  If any queerness comes, give the signal!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I will!” she answered, after which I then jumped—down from the top of the watchtower.  “W-wait—!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lise’s surprised yelp, heard as I descended the great height, but not through empty air, no.  Hands gripping the ladder rails, I slid steadily down towards the bailey.  Nearing the ground, I kicked off and landed with a large thud.  But no sooner did I draw the soot-black blade and bolted straightway to the gates.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Open up!” I shouted, earning more surprise, this time from the gatekeeping brave.  But little time was wasted as he then unlatched the crossbar and pushed against the great barrier.  Groaning open, the gates revealed a sight rife with Fiefguardsmen, two of whom slipped through.  The first to meet my eyes met also my blade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hweh?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such be the low utterance of many a soldier at the moment of their unmaking.  Few are they who leave behind words worth remembering.  This man failed to join that mighty minority.  So, too, did the one near him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Aagh!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With two vanguards vanquished, I rushed on with unrelenting speed.  Beyond the barrier, ten and more foes yet remained for the maiming.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Close up once I’m clear!  Straightway!” I shouted again to the Nafílim guards.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Putting the gates behind me, I charged and challenged the Fiefguardsmen at the fray.  Dragon-burnt steel drove through air and flesh, and by the time the gates finally boomed to a close, five Men had fallen to my blade.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">───────── ∵ ─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">I was stunned.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Stunned, and standing in wonder at what had unfolded before my eyes: Rolf, as if beckoned by the spirit of daring, took a leap down from the very top of the watchtower—a height of no less than seventy Füße.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That giant of a Man, once in my company, now gone like the wind—a vanishing taking with it all words from my lips.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">His standing and watching of the battlefield was calm and still till not a moment ago.  Even as our enemy marched nearer and nearer unto our midst, Rolf had remained both the undisturbed boulder and the eagle keen on the perfect swoop.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">His decisiveness astounded, his immovability moved.  How deep in awe I was.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I recalled then the telling of his story on the night of our meeting in Hensen.  Of how, on fault of ill-communing with Yoná, godhead of Man, he was made to live through winters cold of gentleness and pale of society.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But ‘twas nonetheless an unembellished telling: though he wore much pain, Rolf recounted his woes as more their watcher and less their liver, never painting the truth with deeper grief nor coaxing undue pity.  His past was laid out as bare as could be.  Yet Men hold their Deiva to be absolute; this was the further truth, and no doubt was in me that their zealotry exacted from Rolf tolls and toils beyond common suffering.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In spite of it all, this wayward Man lost not his way.  On and on, he strove.  On and on, he fought, never once casting away his sword or his honour.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A marvel of a Man, Rolf.  A marvel seldom beheld, a Man seldom bred.  That was my reckoning of him.  And as if his valiance could wear not a brighter lustre, his was also the acumen of a sharp commander, as shown on this day.  I realised then the realness of the power that so delivered Balasthea from the brink over these past few moons… and with it, a peculiar solace in being by his side, as though I were sat in the soft shade of a great tree, amidst the vividness of a midsummer noon.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But that idyll was only a daydream.  This was a battlefield, and our foes, though diminishing with each passing moment, had managed to gain our walls.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Rolf…!  At the gates…!’</i> I had said.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;I’ll handle this…’</i> he answered swift.  <i>‘&#8230;The watch is yours, Lise…  If any queerness comes… give the signal…!’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">His words revealed to me the sort of soldier he was: a commander and frontline fighter both.  The same as I.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Words most warming.  Eyes most encouraging.  Once more had Rolf given to me comfort of a kind ill-belonging on a battlefield.  But another moment, and those words, those eyes, then vanished right from my midst.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;W-wait…!’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A yelp from my lips, teased out by pure surprise.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas a watchtower whereupon I stood, no less; its very top, whence could be gleaned the lay of the land for a Meile and more beyond the fort walls.  Only a craver of death would leap so free from this great height, but Rolf had done just that.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Astonished, to the opposite parapet I went, only to find him asail down the ladder, blunting his fatal descent with hands strained against the rails.  Then he landed, thumping the air like a full-swung drumbeat and rousing in his wake a plume of dust.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Wonderment struck me once more, to see so large a figure as Rolf’s alight with such grace from so high a place—a figure that next broke forth at once, drawn blade in hand, striding legs whisking him beyond the opening gates.  There, with vivid ferocity, did Rolf then bring new battles upon the Fiefguard.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so was I left stunned and quieted.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such happenings, at too great a speed.  A hare outrunning my ken.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Just now was he here.  Not more than a minute ago.  Standing, and gleaning all sight and sound from the battlefield.  But a blink, and Rolf was next in the thick of it, far down and far ahead.  His sword danced, his mettle shone.  Bidding the gates be closed, he pressed deeper into the fray, drawing the enemy vanguard away from the fort.  And amidst such action, one by one he threw down his foes with mighty swings of black steel.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That’s ‘im!  The treacher!” came a cry from the enemy masses.  A field commander’s, by the sound of it; already were they keen on Rolf.  “Close ranks!  Kill ‘im quick!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Spears glinted.  A maw of many fangs gnashing at Rolf.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“No…!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At once I tensed, clenching my teeth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I had no doubt: Rolf’s strength was true.  He well-proved it in Hensen.  This, my mind knew.  But my heart… how it wailed for the scene, for the ally waylaid by rows of spears, each thirsting for his death.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">These foes were able enough.  Encircling slow ‘round Rolf, they maintained formation amidst the din of other frays about them.  Were I their mark, I would break away and reset the situation.  Indeed; back off and be on the prowl for a gap in their ranks.  And once an opening shows, lunge in from the flank—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Wha…!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—but Rolf’s was a different thought.  With sword poised, he charged—straight at the bristling phalanx.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The spears answered, closing in on him like a whirlpool.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I gasped.  My breaths stopped.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But then: a mystery.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The spearpoints sprang upon him—all of them—yet bit no more than the very air about his body.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“How…” I exhaled in amazement.  ‘Twas as though the steel tips were sent against the repelling side of a lodestone—nay, as though the spears themselves <i>feared</i> Rolf.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The surprise on my face was clear-echoed on those of Rolf’s very foes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But of course, the truth behind their failed offence was more mundane: Rolf had mere-espied—with all immediacy—the dead zone of their spears and seized the moment.  Mundane, for true.  Even a curtain of readied spears is not without its gaps; such weapons in such a formation could do little else but strike straight, hence ‘tis beyond no imagining that there might arise inside it some indefensible void.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What proved beyond mundane was Rolf himself: not in the common soul could be found valour enough to endeavour the feat on peril of instant death.  How many winters of rigour and hard-mastered study did Rolf endure, I wonder, to reach so sublime a state?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ryaahh!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A thunderous roar from Rolf.  A heaving swing of the soot-steel.  Blackness tore through flesh, redness spewed through the air.  To the ground hurled many foes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Eeaaghh!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Men down, men down!  We need more hands!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And in the wake: a screaming swell from the Fiefguard.  More of the vanguard near the gates answered the desperate call and scrambled in Rolf’s direction.  But defying their great number, he slashed away at the tide of Men.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Elsewhere, far in the distance, fought Volker and his brave-host.  Their striving was as an iron grip, never letting fly the advantage hard-earned by our roadside ambush.  By this point, they were whipping the Fiefguard into fleeing, laying low Men where they could and leaving the rest to scatter in misery.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All facets of this great fight, then, shone with our impending victory.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Rraaahh!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And breaking the clouds was Rolf’s voice, boisterous and cutting, but clarion and baritone.  A rich voice full-bent on the fight, resounding strong through the air, that even atop the watchtower whence I stood, it carried and echoed well into my bosom and belly both.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In concert to his vociferation was the sword of soot—and what trailed its many arcs.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Fine wisps of black, brushed in crescent moonstrokes, only to thin away into naught like a mist.  Left behind were bodies rent by the wolfsteel’s bite and Rolf’s towering form—gallant, and beautiful, even.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Fall back!  Fall back!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Cries from the Fiefguard, bellowed now to much repetition.  With their numbers grievous-culled, the Men began retreating en masse, like a tide receding from the shores whence they came.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Victory was ours, then.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Victory for the prelude to our attack on Arbel.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia trembled.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Trust was not in her—not for the ghastly sight reflected in her ruby eyes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Our line fails!  We need troops!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Retreat’s bar’d!!  Make way, ye lack-wits!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Fiefguard—full-pressed into a flailing panick!  They came as bawcocks, bold and brazenly set upon retaking Balasthea, only to be taken by sore surprise!  For ambush was their welcome, played out in the clear open, before a single foot of theirs ever broke the bailey’s soil.  Pinched in by Nafílim fighters, the Men were split and scattered, soon finding themselves easy prey for the hard hunt.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To Felicia, perched upon a hill near the rearmost ranks, such was the vivid vista presented.  A vista of failed wits and perilous error.  What impossibility is this?  Who is it that leads the Nafílim host?  The questions urged the brigadier to break her gaze away from the grimness and look to the fort far ahead.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Soon enough, she spotted a peculiarity: a figure, flying down from the watchtower whence the whistling arrow was fired moments ago.  Nay, not from so high a height could a man fly without dire need of mending thereafter.  Perhaps the figure <i>fell?</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Pondering, Felicia next found the fort’s gates gaping open, from the crack of which rushed out that very same figure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Her lips gave a gasp.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There was in that figure, that distant, sword-swinging silhouette, features that stoked a fear in her.  Features, faint from so far away, yet gravely familiar to her eyes: a stature most outstanding in its height and stoutness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The reality she had so repudiated returned to her thoughts with thorns bristling anew.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“No… ‘twas true…?” she whispered, <i>“&#8230;Brother…?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Anear, the rearguard swelled with sallowed soldiers, freshly fleeing the butchery yonder.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Back!  Fall Back!  Now!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Theirs was no longer an onward march, but a stampede back to the safety of the fief-burgh.  Doubtless a cowardly, if not calculated choice—and as well, the sole path to survival, for they had not the mettle to muster against so sudden a disadvantage.  The vanguards who might have sniffed a chance at bearing down upon Balasthea were now themselves hounds whimpering back with tails tucked betwixt their shivering haunches… or bodies ready for the unmarked burial.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Fall back!  Fall back!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Scores of like screams scratched endlessly at the air.  On that day, the Fiefguard failed and flew back to Arbel, their numbers dwindled by no small fraction.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────ㅤ♰ㅤ─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Rolf!” cried a voice.  “P-Pardon!  A moment!  If it pleases you!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To it I turned and tarried, having been on my way to meet Lise and Volker.  The battle was ended; the braves bustled fervently as they filed back into the fort.  Out of the crowd emerged a young fellow of a Nafíl, looking not much older than I during my first days at the Order.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“It does,” I answered above the clamour, watching as he quickly came by.  “What is it?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Th-this victory, it is owed to you!  Our losses are little—not without your command could we’ve seen this day!” he sunnily said, face flustered and almost breathless.  But having been worn by winters of lambastings rather than laudings, I couldn’t help but feel a bit flustered myself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Your praise gladdens the ears,” I returned.  “&#8230;Though you’d best leave them for Lise’s and Volker’s.  It’s their skill and command that carried our cause.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oh, y-yes, of course!  Our leaders’ll find no frail love from me, they won’t!  But yours, Rolf—your shoulders shrink not beside theirs, if you get my meaning!” he expounded with passion.  “Just as you didn’t shrink when the enemy gained the gates!  ‘Mighty’ be my best word for it!  What with your charging their file, and felling them with that fey sword of yours!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I itched with unease at those words, as I felt my fencing unworthy of any acclaim yet.  But to hear that I was “mighty”, that I did not “shrink” in the face of my foe—that well-earned my gratitude.  For courage was my one regard I wished most to earn remembrance: in combat, in character, above all else and all others.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And when you bade the gates be shut upon your exit—I feel a fable was unfurled before my eyes, if you know what I mean!” the fervent fellow continued.  “The boldest of the brave, breaking into peril to protect the bastion!  The stuff of legends!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Joining the fray—not exactly the deed of a reasoned commander, I should admit, but I let it be.  This youth was pouring into his praise his very heart; it’d be callous of me to throw cold water on him now.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I only did as was demanded, but thank you,” I relented.  “You know my name—what of yours?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ah, aye!  I’m Bruno!” he answered, bowing.  “A pleasure!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Bruno, good lad,” I said back, presenting a hand to him.  “Let’s give our all next we battle—together.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“O-of course!  Together!”  And with both his own, he shook mine.  A hale warmth was in his spirited grip.  “Till then!  Fair winds comfort you!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And off he went with a spring in his steps.  Soon in his place were both Lise and Volker, approaching with wisps of wonder in their eyes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Quite the devotee there,” remarked Lise.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“One I’m honoured to have, if true.  It was a glad meeting,” I admitted.  Cast upon me were yet stares of no small number, each nursing embers of doubt.  I recalled then of Kunz.  Of meeting him in Hensen, of being pressed by his arrant rage, his ill-salved sorrow.  His was the smouldering stare most unforgettable of all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A comfort, then, to know that in some like Bruno, there burnt a fire of a friendlier ardour.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“His compliments be not queer, I think,” Volker added.  “Many braves take heed of your sound succour at Hensen, Rolf—to note little of both your bloodless felling of this fastness and the fierceness of your fighting on this day.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Not just this day, then,” I proclaimed, looking intently at busied braves.  “In all to come, I’ll strive to win their vouching.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Through battle.  Through resolute and unrelenting battle.  For their cause, for their sacrifices—their future.  And in so doing earn their trust, at last.  This I trusted to be the rightwise way.  Much hard work, then, laid ahead.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Well… al-already you’ve won some, I’d say,” stammered Lise, curiously quiet.  “A fair fight you’ve waged for us, Rolf.  Most fair—brave even, and… and bea… b-beautiful… I-I confess.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Beautiful’?” I remarked, surprised.  “I see.  Glad to know there be a glint of beauty in my bladework, if one as beautiful as yourself vouches for—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hya!?”</i> she yelped, loudly and out-of-the-blue.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Was I rude, perchance?  Likely so, looking at Lise.  Splendid; once again I’ve let my mouth run off.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ehr, V-Volker!  Y-your sweat was much succour itself, wasn’t it!?” she said, turning asudden to the war-chief.  The topic had turned sour on her tongue, it seemed.  “Mine was quite the easy task thanks to you!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“As was mine,” answered Volker, grinning faintly.  “A gainsome hand it was that Rolf dealt us.  I had but to play as promised.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not as gainsome as he touted it to be, I should say.  Nonetheless, all had gone to plan, for our foes, too, had played obediently the hand of our dealing.  Time was a luxury lost to them; had they any more of it, wisdom might’ve cooled their heads and inspired them to the possibility of an ambush.  And as well, the falsity of Morten’s report.  All the better for us, then, that they sooner heeded haste than hesitation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Foremost in the margrave’s mind was surely Morten’s telling of the Fiefguard’s triumphant return from Hensen.  If it were a backstabbing trap that awaited them at Balasthea, then speed should’ve seen them saved.  And so it was that the lord let loose his remaining men to trounce our “trap”, sparing time for neither prudence nor planning.  No, not even for an investigation into the veracity of the two opposing reports… nor for properly organising his troops, for that matter.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You well-whip’d our foes to a fever’d haste, Rolf—horses hying to a cliff-edge their eyes had scant time to see, as it were,” Volker went on.  “A gesture of genius, I admit.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But with your chase, they had no chance of changing course, Volker,” I returned.  “Your command was most commendable; that’s my admittance.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Let us leave it at that, then.  Pelting such praises as we do only passes precious time.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You have a point,” I relented, chuckling.  I felt then a smile growing on my face—slight, but warm with gladness.  On the side was Lise, also smiling at us, if not rather awkwardly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Coldly from his office did the margrave take in the ill-tiding.  Yet again did the word “defeat” nip his nerves.  The sorry sight of his Fiefguard, retreating from their rout, crushed all comfort that denial and self-deception might have afforded him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Long had he held them in high regard, his military men.  The Fiefguard: mighty defenders of this march of Ström.  The honour was well-warranted.  For many a time have they forayed bravely into Nafílim country and came back brimming with hard-earned boons.  Why, the margrave even fancied them no less fearsome than the knights of the Orders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such pride—now all but pulverised.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf’s was but a small force, a pack of Nafílim no larger than a nipple of a legion.  <i>Those</i> were Morten’s words.  Oh, the lies laced in them!  And if lies they were, so it must be that the margrave’s forayers were indeed hewn down at Hensen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…So it must be that the victors of that vying, vicious as they were bristlingly abundant, were now come to his doorstep.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Hensen, then, was a reeking failure of a raid.  Would that he trusted to the contrary!  Not the maunderings of Morten the fool, no, but the fled Fiefguardsmen’s grovelling details of their defeat!  A bitter truth beholding the loss of a hundred-score soldiers!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Now were the tables turned.  <i>Now</i> did the Nafílim mean to march on Arbel, aggression against which the fief-burgh might have had shields enough to guard… had the margrave not bitten the bait so capriciously.  His losses only seemed to mount: of the thousand soldiers he had sent to break Balasthea today, not much more than three-hundred returned to Arbel alive.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A force once thrice-thousand strong, now nine-times decimated.  And amongst the remnants themselves were the wounded and battle-unworthy; the “small force”, then, was not Rolf’s, no—it was the margrave’s.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">By such meagre numbers shall Arbel be ill-delivered from this dire plight.  The realisation racked and grated at the margrave to no end.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>Bang!</i>—upon the desk: a furious fist.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Damn it all!!” barked the lord, after which a Fiefguard commander then entered the room.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“M’liege…” he said sheepishly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I <i>know,”</i> sighed the margrave.  “We are cornered—defence be our only road in this ruction.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What of Central?” the commander suggested.  “Might we seek their succour, m’liege?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Already a courier bears my call to Redelberne, but it shall be days ere deliverance comes.  <i>Days!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Days, indeed.  Deadly and terrible days of defending against the Nafílim with just an enfeebled Fiefguard.  And in that struggle, Arbel would fold long before its walls were aught more than a distant twinkle in the eyes of Central’s reinforcements.  The foe, then, seemed the clear and uncontested victor, even as the horns of battle were yet unblown.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nay… the last card lies yet unplayed,” hissed the margrave, as though relenting after being wrung dry of all pride.  “The sellswords of Zaharte—they shall see this through.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Heretofore had the margrave defended his fief with naught but the soldiery of this land.  He well-wore the feat as a prideful pin, but today was the day it was torn from his lapel, and to grope after it would imperil the whole of the province itself.  So instead, he sought the services of the foresaid free company, which, on this occasion, so happened to be sojourning within Ström’s borders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ah, but of course!  The vaunted Zaharte Battalion!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sunlit expectation scintillated through the commander’s voice, a clear contrast to his lord’s contempt.  Rightfully so, for the mercenaries of Zaharte were highly regarded.  Though they branded themselves a battalion, their number hardly beseemed the term: not more than a hundred was their count, yet quality corroborated their ferocity, enough to rival a real battalion in strength.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Foremost amongst them were the Östbergs, the twin heads of the horde.  Brother and sister they were, and in the minds of all Londosians, readily renowned as a force to be reckoned with upon the battlefield.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such free companies roamed the realm, seeking coin for combat wheresoever they went.  From time to time would they tarry in a province before braving the wilderness once more.  That the Zaharte Battalion of fame would find Ström its waterhole for this whirlwind of a while was, to the margrave, a windfall, without a doubt.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Indeed.  An envoy of theirs arrives presently,” revealed the lord.  “We must join with their muddied hands and rally our remnants for a reprisal.  By my very soul shall this land be delivered—as Yoná is my witness.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“As it shall, m’liege!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In invoking the holy name of the Deiva did the margrave attempt to buoy his buried spirits.  Yet buried they remained.  Irritation, regret, wrath—spiteful worms all wriggling and writhing in his clouded bosom.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">The past.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In remembering do I relive pain.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">From my heart: all the hurt.  Springing, sprouting, stinging.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Even amidst the mirth of many other memories, fair and fond.  Even as enthroned in me was a childhood spent blissfully with Brother and Emilie both.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Beside it all sat the hurt.  Ever in my heart, unwaning, unwithering.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Mingle not with that thing…  You are our hope now, Felicia…  Our next-in-line…  Do choose your company—wisely…’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such was Father’s bidding.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas that dark day.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The day Brother was received at the Roun of Orisons.  A day that changed all that was and all yet to come.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Why? I thought to myself.  Again and again.  Over and over.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Brother…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ever was he the apple of everyone’s eyes.  Everyone, save our Deiva.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How did such travesty chance upon us?  Upon Brother?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A mistake.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That’s all.  Just a simple mistake.  ‘Twas what I wished it to be.  Dearly, and more dearly still.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet Yoná yields no mistakes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">As She is not wont to err, so She is our Deiva, one and only.  A truth plain to every eye.  And if the fault lies not in Her, then so it must in Brother.  Thus was he branded the black sheep of Her herd.  A stigma in our midst.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Consort with traitors to the Deiva and you are like to share in their filth…’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Mother’s words.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A warning to keep away from my own brother, conveyed most clearly to my ears.  Even though ‘twas clearer still that, up to the day of the rites, Brother was, to her, a son most beloved.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Even though “my pride and joy” was oft what she said of him.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">On the day of his departure to the Order, I could not send him off as I would’ve liked.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rather, I wasn’t allowed.  And so I made due from a distance.  Through my chamber window, I watched Brother far below as he prepared to depart.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The carriage was parked in waiting.  Waiting by the manor gates.  Waiting to whisk him away to the Order headquarters.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Emilie was present, as well.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Standing amidst a crowd, all gathered to celebrate the first step on her new journey.  Amongst them were her parents, her servants—even little Maria, youthful handmaiden that she was.  To Emilie went their warmth, their praise, their pride… their pain in parting from her so.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Whilst nearby was my brother.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Standing amidst company as cold as ‘twas empty.  Mother and Father were present, but had nary a mind to see him off.  They instead meant to make certain he would be gone for good.  And just like that, with not a soul to bid him farewell, Brother began to board the carriage.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But as he did, he paused… and turned my way.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;ah!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I lurched closer and leant on the window, as though hurried by my heart.  That I might be full-found by his eyes.  That he might know—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—away his look went.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Mother had struck him across the face.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Don’t you dare even look at Felicia…!  Our dear heir needn’t suffer your profane gaze…!  Have you no shame…!?’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Even from my chamber, high and far, were those words most audible.  Such was Mother’s indignance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet I heard also a tremble in her treble.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The sound of a sobbing voice.  The voice of a mother believing herself betrayed by her child.  The child she had nurtured with so much of her own love.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">After a brief apology, Brother then boarded the carriage.  On and on I watched as it set off, wheeling away down the avenue, till it vanished into the horizon.</p>
<p>&nbsp;<br />
&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">From then on, just as Brother’s life was upheaved, so, too, was mine.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The education, the esteem, the expectation he had long endured… all were now mine to suffer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;This is Felicia…  Our daughter… and our dear heir…’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;My…!  Fairest Felicia… an honour and pleasure both…!’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There was yet a year left till my own enlistment in the Order.  A year filled with aristocratic functions, of meeting with the Buckmann barony’s myriad personages of power.  Of stiff and shallow association with many-masked eminences.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Will I be as them one day…?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nonetheless, more and more was I wearied by those wasting days.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The conveyances, the courtesies, the protocols, the etiquettes; trivialities I’d only ever learnt in passing—all of them now required my mastership down to the tiniest minutia.  There was little time for leisure.  The Buckmann brand was all-consuming; a terrible weight full-borne upon just my two shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Beyond mastering manners, there were also studies of many subjects.  Any waking minute spent at the manor was a minute of education, of discipline, of review.  My chamber seemed no longer my own.  Faceless tutours came and went with the turning of the hour.  Such were my days.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Sharply, now…’</i> one of them had said.  <i>‘&#8230;Lag here… and it shall be the wastrel’s lot awaiting you…’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That “wastrel” being none other than Brother, for certain.  And just like Mother, more certain again was this tutour’s former praise for Brother.  Frequent and glowing praise—now but insults, snide and shaded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas a matter beyond my mould to mend.  Yet never did it cease to gnaw at me, the nonsense of it all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The other tutours, too, doled out like disregard.  But of them, the theologian fumed most with hate for Brother.  By his words, he’d always felt Brother to be rather pale of respect for our Deiva.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">By my own measure, Brother had ever and always mastered his studies, no matter the subject, for he hated none of them—not even theology.  But to think, that lurking in the lack of hate was the absence of respect…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…this, I couldn’t understand.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">We lambs of Yoná must needs always pay our respects to our Deiva, whether through awe or adoration or aught else.  Such has ever been our way.  How, then, did Brother go astray?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Be that as it may, I very soon lost all luxury to worry for him so.  Each and every day found me breathless and bewildered with business of myriad sorts.  Boulders of duty as Buckmann’s only heir, pressing me with a weight once borne by Brother like a feather upon a finger.  A weight I shouldn’t have suffered had he not been disinherited.  Though hardly a weight that begat in me a grudge of any sort.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But somewhere, deep down inside, below all waking thought, a sense was sown in me.  A sense that he’d betrayed me.  A sense that soon sprouted without my attendance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Betray the Deiva… and one betrays the World itself…  Disavowal was his deed, of aught and all…  And so was he disavowed in turn…’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So said the same theologian.  In his tone, his mien, trickled a gleam of triumph.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But such words I could neither challenge nor distrust.  I was too busied.  Too fraught for the mere effort.  In those dire days, the tutours all told me thus in stark concert:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Even he found this easy enough…’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Reminders that I ought achieve all my brother once did.  How crushed I was by the weight of it all.  And yet to have whispered in my ears that such weight only ever half-bothered a “baser being” like my brother, that such difficulty was but a “deception”, despite how desperately I strived…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…certainly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Most certainly had Brother borne the weight of like days and still found freedom enough to ply the sword, to indulge in his love of literature… to spend time with Emilie and me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…I wonder.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What sort of look had he on his face, again?  On such days?  On the daily, even?  I tried to remember.  But a grating noise, and all memory faded at once.  Looking over my shoulder: yet another tutour, clearing his throat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so back to the book in hand my thoughts turned.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">One of many forced upon me.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Blessed” was befitting a brand for that land.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Blessed with sumptuous soils, flourishing flora, and many mountains and rivers to enrich its enviable reaches.  The very portrait of a pastoral idyll.  And soundly secure besides, far from the affrighting frontiers and unwounded by the wilder whims of mother nature.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Threading through its spans were myriad crossroads, as betwixt the bustling heart and bucolic hinterlands of Londosius it laid.  Indeed, its position was prime, a treasure trove of exchange and opportunity.  Such bounties begat also a sense of solace within its citizenry, for a more peaceable pall has it sustained thus far, even whilst walled-in by the war-like convictions of the Crown.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Many years of management, however, noted little from the present lord of this land.  He was benignly banal, an average man of average ambition, his measured maintenance of this fief of his forebears being the sole star to his legacy.  But that was enough.  None could gainsay that he was, at the very least, capable in carrying out what was expected of him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So it was that such a land, presided by such a prince, held such hospitality which no visitor of eminence should find lacking.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This day was no different.  Many persons of prestige were come, for today found this land host to a meeting on military munitions and the expected output thereof.  Chief amongst them: the Dame Mareschal to the 1st Chivalric Order.  A hailed hero of the realm, truly was she an eminence amongst eminences.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Upon conclusion of the meeting, the vaunted visitors were all ushered into the great hall for a resplendent reception.  Sheeted tables were all about, each bedight with brilliant bouquets and platters filled with the finest foods of the land.  Servants wove through the maze of standing guests, pouring wine and dispensing starters.  But there was one press they could not penetrate, and that was the one surrounding the hero-dame herself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What grace, what beauty the guests beheld in her as they all partook of pleasantries and mild merriment.  But soon, this crowd parted left and right, for walking in now was the lord of the land himself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Your Mightiness the Lady Estelle,” he began.  “A pleasure unparalleled to meet you on this fair day.  As lord, I welcome you to my barony of Buckmann.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ah, the Lord of Buckmann himself!  And the fair Baroness besides,” Estelle greeted with a raised glass.  The gesture was requited with a bow and curtsey from the Buckmanns, both of whom, too, balanced fine wine in their hands.  “‘Tis an honour to meet you at last.  I am Estelle of Tiselius, though I see my reputation precedes me.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oh!  <i>Precede!</i>  Even the robins regale us with your feats, madame!” the baron laughed along with his wife.  “Mayhap this be your first stay in our humble province?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Tis indeed, though hardly the first visit.  Business has made me quite the busied tourist, if naught else,” the mareschal answered with gentle joviality.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sure enough, it was by countless commutes to and from the royal capital that Estelle had grown rather familiar with the Buckmann landscape.  Some visits to the nearby towns, too, were under her belt, that she fancied having strode past <i>him</i> unbeknownst at some point in time.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And never does it fail to impress, this place,” she went on, peering briefly at the glow of blazing gloam beyond the windows.  ”All thanks to the fine rule of your house, I’m sure.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With that, a spring-bright smile dawned upon her regard, rousing a wistful sigh from the cincture of guests.  They had all of them heard word of Estelle’s winsome looks; none were disappointed in the slightest.  One might even say they were captivated, for such comeliness, too,  adorned her carriage and conduct both.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Oho!</i>  Your words are as wings whisking me away to Heaven and back, Mightiness!  Too kind you are,” the baron beamingly gushed.  “Indeed, this land is my life—as it should be!  If His Majesty has measured me mete for this fief, then so must I answer with full concern to its care.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Florid deference was in the baron’s diction, and for good reason.  While true that Estelle was daughter to the count of Tiselius, she herself was hardly the head of a house—not so with the baron of Buckmann.  The social ladder saw him situated upon a higher rung than she, thus by rights, there was no need to prostrate himself so before the mareschal, as it were.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But “mareschal” was the rub here.  To be sure, Londosius, militarily minded as it was, illumed its Orderly commanders in a special light, one not to be outshone by any sitting lord.  “Her Mightiness”, then, was not for show.  Further still, the baron beheld before him no other mareschal than that of the 1st: the <i>hero-dame</i> herself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Little wonder, now, as to why his mien was most courteous.  His wife beside him seemed no different.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Fair Mareschal, to all ladies of Londosius are you a shining lodestar, truly—not least to myself, of course,” the baroness said.  “A great honour it is merely to make your acquaintance.  Greater still now that my lord husband has your praises to boast about!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Let them be no less yours, my Lady,” Estelle returned softly.  “But I must say, airing the truth was more my mind than charitable applause.  Peace and plenty—this land is loved by much, and that is no lie.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“My…!” blushed the baroness, covering her gasping grin.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Truly a gladness upon our ears, Mightiness,” spoke her husband, bowing slightly.  “‘Tis but a fruit of unrelenting labour on the part of my wife and I, that the feats of my forefathers should not go fallow.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Modesty, too, was in the baron’s mien.  But deceit?  Nay, for true to his word, the wonderful abundance of the Buckmann barony did owe much to the successes of his ancestors.  The vibrant vegetation, for example, was the product of prudent irrigation works maintained by generations of Buckmanns.  All the rivers, too, were rigorously regulated, thus were floods and like whims of the wild mitigated to a seldomness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The current baron was but a cog in this enduring machine, a mere inheritor of his predecessors’ hard work.  At the very least, however, he did not fall victim to the same vice committed by many other folk, ennobled or no: that of summing up his self-worth solely from the feats of his former lions and the prestige of his household.  No, the baron was no such man.  He merely saw his station as one of nurturing the fruits of his family, that they may be handed down unbruised to the next-in-line.  And so was he never moved to endeavour any enterprise beyond his mould, nor to mar the amalgamated boons of the Buckmann line.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A man not so noteworthy—that was the baron.  But he knew as much, and was sooner content than concerned with it.  And for a wealsman such as he, it was a rare trait, indeed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Buckmannfolk be blessed,” Estelle reflected.  “Surely could they not have wished for a finer lord.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nay, my part be small,” the baron said, waving his hand humbly.  “Their blessings are rather born from the peace you and yours assay to protect, madame.  Such rigours earn our greatest gratitude.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sunny was the baron’s smile.  But not so for the mareschal, whose mien was then enshawled in shade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Peace… is it, now?” she echoed quietly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A cloud then grew over the lord’s look.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Had he toed over some line?  Perhaps so.  For centuries has war smouldered under Londosius’ soles, but now did it burn more brightly than ever.  “Peace”, then, ill-palled the realm and its people—not least those braving the fighting fields themselves.  Theirs were shoulders bearing the burdens of battle most terrible of all.  Where was peace <i>for them?</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The baron, keeper of his calm and curated garden, knew not.  And yet did he gaily speak of it afore the mareschal, offering what but a <i>sunny</i> thanks for it.  The absence of solemnity was thus a slight against the hero-dame, who herself had hitherto wagered her very life on the frontlines no few times before.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I… I spoke awrong,” the baron said darkly.  “Most dear be this peace, paid with sacrifices bitter beyond our knowing.  Not lightly is it eked out; not lightly should it be lived.  Yet light did I make of it.  A sin upon my head, Mightiness.  Pray forgive me.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Why such words, Lord Buckmann?” the mareschal asked the brooding baron, her regard unreadable.  “Peace is peace, is it not?  Free and deserved by all?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Tis indeed, madame.  Peace be the due of all Londosian folk, certainly.  But wealsman that I am, my station demands more… nuance.  And there did I fail to answer.  The stain of ignorance is mine to wash.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With bitterness were bent the baron’s brows, his gaze grave as it cast down.  Bared in his words was his heart of hearts.  The baroness, too, appeared no less pressed by her husband’s faux pas.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Seeing them so morose, Estelle inly sighed.  They were unsullied, these two, set with jewels of just and genial sentiment.  Meeting them here on this mild evening informed the mareschal as much.  But more lurked behind this “much”.  For on those heart-jewels glimmered cracks and ill-formed facets of foolery: dullards, Estelle deemed them.  The “why” of it was simple.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">These two had once abandoned a child.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nay, they had disavowed that child’s very <i>existence.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">If such became not the deed of dullards, then what did?  Bearing this thought, Estelle parted her lips once more.  Here on this day, in this hall, would be aired the words she had longed to give breath to.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Splendid,” she began, handing off her wine glass to a servant.  “You well-hem in the howls of your heart, my Baron—a lodestar in your own right, hm?  How blessed your <i>children</i> be, to have such a light to look to.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A wisp of anger gave volume to her voice.  But to her, it was not to be helped, for the Buckmanns were fair folk, more so than her prior measure of them.  And that was precisely why it pricked at the hero-dame’s patience so.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">If fair they be, then <i>why?</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This, Estelle could not help but wonder.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>Why</i> commit so cruel a mistake?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>Why</i> abandon a child so?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Oh, how it racked her.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But for however much it did, the Buckmanns discerned it not.  Nevertheless, their faces were stiff.  For years now, it was taboo to touch the very topic of “children” in their presence.  The other guests seemed to understand this quite well as they watched on in cold sweat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">After a moment of numb confoundment, the Buckmanns at last broke their silence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Blessed, indeed, for our part, as well,” the baron almost stammered, unsteadily nodding.  “Dear Felicia took well to the burdens of her upbringing.  She is our pride and joy.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That she is!” his wife echoed.  “And a Dame Brigadier to the Order, no less!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oh, I know.  Very well, in fact,” said Estelle.  “To mine ears stream word of the strong, whether they hail from the 1st… or the 5th.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To this, the Buckmanns exhaled with relief.  Their stiff faces softened to those of parents, sparkling with pride and consideration for their child.  Such warmth only worsened Estelle’s irritation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Loving and lauding their dear daughter, Felicia Buckmann, was not in itself a crime, no.  It was well and fine, in fact.  But was that it?  Had they nothing at all for another of their rearing?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The thought rose and rushed to Estelle’s lips.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;You are blessed with a <i>son,</i> as well, are you not?” she asked with sharpness, straightway cutting open whatever comfort that might have eased the Buckmanns’ faces.  Petrified once more, their brows furrowed further than before.  All pleasantry turned to pain.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Your Mightiness,” the baron began again, tense in his timbre.  “Verily you seem apprised of the man himself.  You, the very pinnacle of the knightly Orders, suffering the stain of… of so vain and vapid an officer.  What indignance you thus bear, I can scarce imagine.  For my part, I am shawled in shame to have ushered in such a shadow upon this world.  But, pray, do know this: that <i>thing</i> is no longer a son of mine.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“It is as my lord husband says, Your Mightiness,” the baroness added.  “That <i>thing</i> is but a worm of an otherworld, slithering through our lands—a fiend fancying itself a son of Man.  Its presence pains us greatly, but silence should serve a greater salve.  Pray let this rest, madame.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Oh, the heat howling now in the hero-dame’s veins!  Any more and her blood might truly have boiled over.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet this was no habit of hers.  Portrait of prestige that she was, not few of her days were spent spewing platitudes with the many other who’s whos of high society.  But if there was aught such unsought days have honed in her, it was the art of the palliative, of masking herself in mildness to unmake any arisen friction.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Would that the hard-learnt lessons availed her here, for brimming from her face now was anger most apparent to any eye.  The wrath of Londosius’ most renowned blade, laid all too bare.  Such rancour then coldened to a keenness for killing, coursing from every span of her body.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Buckmanns yelped.  There they stood, frozen as frogs afore a seething, glaring serpent.  The other guests, all of them, recoiled in fright.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Dr-dread Mareschal!” the baron whimpered.  “Most just be your rage, most just, indeed!  But pray perish all mind for that man.  He is a wayside stone, a sallowed soul, a soiling eye-sore!  Yet nary an obstacle should he prove to the mighty momentum of you and yours!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Th-that he is, and naught more!” his wife yipped.  “And should he be a babe too blaring in his blubbering, why, do cast him off, madame.  To some dungeon corner, dark and alone.  He’ll rot soon enough, I reckon!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At that very moment did a scabbard hang from the hero-dame’s hip.  And sheathed in it: a live sword.  A fact of much regret to the mareschal, as to stay her sword-hand from reaching the hilt required a mountain of restraint.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Oh, for one’s own child, what wicked words.  Allowed by divine law though they were, Estelle yet found herself incapable of concealing her ire.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;And I reckon not.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Those few words, finally wrung out of her, were aimed exactly at the baroness’ desired doom for her son.  But the Buckmanns’ discernment of this was clear off the mark: they instead took them as an echoing repudiation of the ungraced himself, that for sure did the mareschal vehemently share in their disgust for the child they themselves begat and reared.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What hope they had for this day.  Hope in meeting the mareschal, hope in forming a lasting fellowship with so famed and fair a personage.  For to be friends with Londosius’ foremost lioness would surely shine a new light upon the future of House Buckmann.  But in their reverie had they roused the lioness to her present rage.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It was all that man’s fault.  The man they once raised as a son of their own.  Even now, of all times, was he managing to mangle things up!  This was the Buckmanns’ thought, boiling in their bosoms by the heat of regret.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Y… Your Mightiness,” the baron began again, “we share in your chagrin, we do.  For in fairer days did we once harbour hope for him.  But those days are dusked.  He has turned a man ungraced, a hound unfanged—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I reckon not, I said!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So repeated Estelle, her tone a tempered edge, her indignance a damning ring through the hushed hall.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">The son of House Buckmann: a castaway cadet… and a soul spurned of holy communion with the Deiva.  Such was his lot, and Estelle dared no argument against it.  But for the baron to brand his abandoned son a “hound unfanged”, feeble and haggard—in that, Estelle found fault.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This “hound”, as they called him, had fangs enough.  A wolf of valour, winter-worn and well-fought, with a will of steel forged in fires of resolve.  Of this, Estelle’s eyes have seen, her ears have heard, her heart has felt.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To think, that this son’s merits were fast forgotten by his own begetters—nay, were as yet <i>unknown</i> to them, served only to stoke further the hero-dame’s displeasure.  Though the wine she had been sipping, too, might have had a hand in fanning her flames.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Lord and Lady both.  Your lips seem loath to whisper even the name of your son.  Allow <i>me,</i> then, if you will,” Estelle continued, her anger eloquent and unabated.  “Your son, this <i>‘Rolf Buckmann’&#8230;”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There, clarion in the mareschal’s own voice: the gallant ungraced’s very name, and to Buckmann air, an anathema.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;is most <i>remarkable.</i>  A man of unmatched regard!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Gaping open now was the baron’s mouth.  <i>“Howha…!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The mareschal’s was too puzzling a proclamation to him.  The lamb unloved by Yoná, Most Divine; the apostate ill-suffered in the spans of this land—common sense makes clear that such a man deserves damnation wheresoever he wanders.  And yet, here hurrying into the baron’s ears were Estelle’s stellar <i>praises</i> for the vauntless vagrant.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Y-Your Mightiness?” the baron said breathlessly.  “I-I fear I miss your meaning…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Estelle stared with steel at the Buckmanns.  “I meant exactly as you’ve heard: your son is a <i>magnificent</i> man.  More so than you—than <i>all</i> of you.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A remark to mar the mirth of any social function.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not even the mareschal’s prestige could escape unscathed in vouching for the unvouchable like she did.  Indeed, though she be the hero-dame of Londosius, unrivalled and unreachable, to veer so clearly away from creed and collective thought was sure to lay barbs and briars upon her path.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But it was a remark too long in the making.  To leave it unaired sat most ill with Estelle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">His beaten and bloodied figure, fighting on and on for all he believed in.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">His stout and unsung stature, unrelenting even aface uncountable scorn and contempt.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There was no shame in aught he shouldered.  Yet shame was all his bloodkin knew of him.  Shame was all they could speak of him.  Shame was his one and only name to them.  But well-knowing the truth of him and his trials, and hearing them challenged unjustly by his own parents, Estelle was taken very nearly to tears.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But no more.  Hers would be the words that severed this silence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“M… magnif… ficent?” the baron muttered.  “That man, you say?  More than I?  Than us <i>all?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“M-Madame,” said the baroness, small and muted.  “Might have you mistaken him for another, perchance?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nay.  Mine is no mistake,” Estelle answered.  “Rolf Buckmann—a martial-devout!  A mind of whetted wisdom!  A man of golden gallantry!  And you?  What are yours but crumbs of an accomplishment, scattered in the shadow of <i>his</i> mountain of merits?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“W… <i>wh…”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Words were all but lost to the lord and lady.  To be “below” an ungraced—an insult of unequalled slander!  But that earned not the brunt of their disbelief; rather, it was in Estelle’s very speech.  The hero-dame of Londosius, most renowned in all the realm, maundering on matters most mysterious to their ears.  Was this some jest?  A joust of words for dubious merriment?  The Buckmanns could not know.  The mareschal’s very <i>demeanour,</i> they could not comprehend.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so their confusion remained neither mended upon their mien, nor paid any mind from the hero-dame.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Long should I’ve been buried, if not for Rolf.  I, along with a great many other knights and dames,” she confessed.  “Hark, my good Baron.  This very moment ought find you sobbing…  upon the headstone of your pride!  Your joy!  Your dear daughter <i>Felicia!</i>  Were Rolf any less of a man!  For she, too, owes her living breath to her brother!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“No…!” the baron grimaced.  “Madness…!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Madness, indeed!  That you scorn the truth!” Estelle countered.  “Yet think you madness be my mien?  Think you, Baron, these lips be given to lies?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lies?  Not so.  Felicia’s life was living proof.  A twice-attested token of Rolf’s heroism, for not only at the Battle of Erbelde was she delivered by him, but in the grim mirk of Mt. Godrika, as well.  And of the two feats, neither had escaped the mareschal’s ken.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nay, I… I… b-but… <i>mmngh!”</i> groaned the lord.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Buckmanns were pale by this point.  They could fathom none of the confusion afore them.  Bludgeoned by balderdash, harried by this hogwash of a humiliation—<i>them!</i>  The very lord and lady of this manor, this land!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Then, as though impelled by what pride he had in his position, the baron managed to open his mouth again.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Y… yet he was damned by our Deiva, all the same.  And <i>that</i> is the truth.  Unchanging, unchallenged!” he cried.  “If aught could be gleaned from so unglozed a truth, let it be this: that man, that <i>thing</i> is a <i>fremd,</i> foul and foreign!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ah, yes.  Of course.  The creed of Yonaism, ever the card-up-the-sleeve for any soul so cornered.  Always reliable, never refutable, for exactly as the baron had broached, it was the common and unquestionable thought of all folk in this realm.  And like a desperate dealer did he dangle his winning card, to which Estelle simply sighed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Pardon,” she said softly, letting her shoulders settle.  “This passion of mine—’twas a fire overfed.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Incredible.  Never had the mareschal lost her cool in the cacophonies of uncountable battlefields.  But to have lost it <i>here</i> of all places?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Estelle inly chided herself for the irony.  Though to be sure, she regretted naught she had aired thus far.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Lord Buckmann,” she began again, newly calmed.  “Oft in this noble sphere that we share is familial love left a forlorn second to the future of the house.  Doling out disinheritance be your right as lord of your line, certainly; that, too, I concede.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still, hers was no heart that could so condone the repudiation of one’s child and its very existence.  But that was a thought Estelle was unfain to unfurl, not after having just collected her cool.  Her mind, then, was to unmince the matter for the baron, that he might fully know the faults of his ways.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But do heed this, Baron, and heed it well,” the mareschal went on.  “Ever are we chained to the choices of our making.  Thus should one day you find fangs bared your way by the very ‘hound’ you chose to abandon—and likewise behold him grown to a grandness far beyond your most fearsome fancies—say <i>never</i> that you had no other choice.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What is this…!?” the baron hissed, his veins vaulting asudden.  “That thing?  A hound soon to harry <i>my way?</i>  My <i>house?</i>  My <i>line!?</i>  Is that your reckoning of him!?  Of this ill affair!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Perhaps,” Estelle answered, clear and quiet.  “Or perhaps… not.  Perhaps to him, <i>you</i> are the wayside stone.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;Waysi…!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The lord, worth not even a whim of attention?  From the very hound he had cast from his house?  A statement most unsought.  His humiliation deepening by the moment, the baron at last began to bristle and quake—a sight savouring not a crumb of care from the mareschal as she turned her back to the Buckmanns.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Most warm was your welcome,” she said, before starting her way out of the great hall, watched by every eye in attendance.  “Thank you and good day, Lord and Lady.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hold there…!” the baron barked, grinding his teeth, with his wife fuming beside him all the while.  “Why?  Why do you vouch for that vermin so!?  Do you not think yourself imperilled by your present port?  A port more beseeming a traitor than a strength of Londosius!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Estelle stopped.  “Nay, Baron.  For strength <i>is</i> my very charge.  Its seeking, its scrying in other souls—I judge strength, that Londosius might live another day.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The lord pointed at her.  “Foolery fogs your eyes!  If ‘strong’ be your measure of him!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Hoarse was his howling by now, to which Estelle turned with a sidelong look upon the lord and his lady.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“I</i> am strong,” she proclaimed, “more so than any other huddled in this hall.”  A truth incontestable.  And none present dared the deed.  Next did The Strong slowly cast her stare from guest to guest, before partaking in another proclamation.  “Such is why I know well of strength.  And thus, of whom are strong and what worth they hide within.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Collective silence answered her.  In it, the Buckmanns remained ill-convinced.  Indeed, Estelle’s words found only deeper disagreement from them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Unthinkable…” the lord’s wife uttered, barely above a whisper.  “&#8230;Most unthinkable.  That so unsightly a stain as he can—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“‘Unsightly’?”</i> Estelle cut in.  “What of your son be unsightly, Lady Buckmann?  Is it not <i>sightly</i> as the summer sun that so unlike his parents, he is a beauty most evident to all eyes beholding?  ‘Tis so to mine, I say—indeed, his features grip me <i>fast in fascination.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A gasp from the baroness.  <i>“Fasci…!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yes, <i>fascinating,</i> those eyes of his, wouldn’t you say?” the mareschal smirked.  “Calm as clouds, yet fierce like fires alive—oh!  Nary a night do I bed unvisited by visions of his gaze.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And his burly body besides, a masterwork of muscle.  A body Estelle saw, knew, felt for herself in the waning throes of the Battle of Erbelde, where in his lumber-like arms was she embraced and bulwarked against an explosion.  The memory was faded not in the faintest.  Recalling it, the mareschal turned away once more.  But as she did…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Why, I ought offer him this very hand,” she added.  “The hand of a hero-bride.”</p>

</div>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With those whirlwind words and one last look, Estelle sauntered off.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Wha…!”</i>  In her wake: the befuddled Buckmanns and their guests, all aghast, each and every one.  Ringing through the air was naught but the footfalls of the mareschal’s silver heels.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Wheeling away from the Buckmann manor now was a grand and guarded carriage.  Within it was sat Francis Behrmann, Under-Mareschal to the 1st, who, with half-opened eyes as saintly as they were silent, looked on at his superior afore him.  There she was, Estelle Tiselius, sword-maiden of Londosius—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—hunched with both hands over her face.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ughh…”</i> she groaned, quite fain to faint at any moment, as her heart reeled with regret for her conduct just moments ago.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">She had said all she needed to say and found no fault in that, for the most part.  Whipping the Buckmanns, too, till they were seething at the seams did not bother her in the slightest.  But as the curtains were closing was she taken by the moment—<i>too</i> taken, really, and curiously so, enough to have teased out of her word after word most unexpected and most unnecessary.  The memory was faded not in the <i>faintest.</i>  Recalling it, the mareschal moaned in misery.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Mmnn…”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Twas a maidenly line, mademoiselle,” came Francis’ remark, a merciless salt-massage upon the mareschal’s wound.  He himself was in attendance, and with unoccluded eyes and ears both had witnessed the episode in full.  “‘Calm as <i>clouds,”</i> he flatly recited, “yet <i>fierce</i> like <i>fires alive.</i> <i> Oh.</i>  Nary a night do I <i>bed unvisited</i> by visions of <i>his gaze.’”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hmmngh…!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘I ought <i>offer him</i> this <i>very hand:</i> the hand of a <i>hero-bride.’”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Nnwaaah!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘I am strong,’</i> this hero-dame had declared.  Yet here the contrary cut more clearly, to which Francis all but sighed and shook his head.  And then, a thought happened.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">His mademoiselle’s warning to the baron—that Rolf Buckmann could one day brandish the blade of betrayal…  with his father being but one of many marks.  Such was Estelle’s seeming meaning, Francis surmised.  Oh, but it was only a hunch, one could say.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet it was one from Estelle Tiselius, and hers was never a hunch to go unheeded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For some time, then, had the mareschal been foreseeing such a future, one now daring to flower.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ever fickle, the fates…” Francis murmured, turning his eyes to the window, where winding by was the dusking beauty of the Buckmann barony.  But yonder, far, far yonder in the western fringe, there blazed frays and fires yet unscried by both him and his mademoiselle.</p>
