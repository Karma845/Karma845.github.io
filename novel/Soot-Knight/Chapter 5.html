<p class="calibre10">Two winters have wheeled by since the day we recaptured the Godrika Minery; five from the day of my enlistment here at the 5th.  At twenty years of age, my charge yet remained as Emilie’s swain.</p><p class="calibre10">From the time of her promotion to mareschal and onwards, Emilie had been taking the liberty of nominating me for the rites of investiture.  A gracious gesture, to be sure, but ultimately a futile one, for it seemed the Marquis Norden was no man to wax philanthropic for an ungraced.</p><p class="calibre10">Thus has my daily routine changed little over the last two years, whether it be in the daily plying of the sword or my menial duties as a swain.  Yet the same could not be said of the world around me, wuthering as it was against the winds of change.</p><p class="calibre10">There was no doubt in any mind that Godrika hid within its bowels a bounty of silver ore.  More doubtless again, however, was that none amongst them could have expected so colossal a yield.</p><p class="calibre10">The argent boon was subsequently meted out to all members of every Order in the form of silver gear.  Rank had little say in the matter: whether he be a seasoned officer or a fresh swain, each and every member of the Order was armed and dressed in that garish metal.</p><p class="calibre10">Save, of course, for the lone ungraced.</p><p class="calibre10">As such, I was the drab dot in a sea of silver, fitted as I was in banal iron.  The reasoning was simple.  Why bequeath to an odylless soul the greatest odyllic conductor of all materials?  Obvious again was the answer, and so too was my unsightly presence&mdash;more so than ever before.</p><p class="calibre10">“Well, if it ain’t our good ol’ <i class="calibre3">alga.</i> Next sword-waggin’ session’s with me, lad!” the knights would often gaggle, as they raised their feders at me.  And at the end of each training session, I would be found down on the ground, laid low, brought low, and thoroughly beaten.</p><p class="calibre10">There was a time when I could handily hand the common knight his defeat in our play of swords.  But those days have long since dusked.  With silver armour aplenty to deploy their palings with, the knights were now forever beyond the reach of my blade.  No longer was there a single opponent to whom I could bare any teeth.</p><p class="calibre10">“Oi <i class="calibre3">alga.  Alga!</i> Have these feders filed and tucked away, will you?”</p><p class="calibre10">“We’ve some more here as well, Ser <i class="calibre3">Alga.”</i></p><p class="calibre10">New jeers have joined the jesting these days.  The second voice: that of a springtide swain.  And in those jeers, there prevailed the pinching term.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">Alga.</i></p><p class="calibre10">The “soot-steeped”.</p><p class="calibre10">It was not long after my enlistment that I was branded with the nefarious byname, conceived as it was from my soot-stained appearance as I emerged from the newly cleaned hearth, upon that cold eventide years ago.  But now was it eagerly and openly aired in full disdain against my person.  Indeed, even from the lips of the greenest swains came mouthings of much scorn.</p><p class="calibre10">Emilie was quick and thorough in her reprimanding of such discrimination.  By her quill was signed the command that forbade the ill behaviour, an unprecedented motion, most certainly.  Yet for however unprecedented or imbued with goodwill that it was, the motion was one made in vain.</p><p class="calibre10">But that was not to say that the knights themselves had it easy.  No longer could their days be whiled away in daydreams or petty pursuits.  To our misfortune, my fears have flowered: Londosius’ lions of war have been let loose, for our sovereign sought battles more than ever before.  The battlefields grew in both number and proximity, and many of the soldiers of the Orders soon found themselves practically living on the frontlines.</p><p class="calibre10">The days before Godrika seemed almost halcyon by comparison.</p><p class="calibre10">“Y’heard what’s happened to Victor, eh?  Went and got his right leg lopped off proper.  And not more than two days ago, either.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yea… the poor lad.  ‘Twas from his thigh on down that got butchered.  Took it and ran off, the Nafílim did.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Well he’s alive, at least.  Not like Lucas&mdash;got his whole heart ripped out of him, that sorry bastard.  Yoná have mercy on us all…”</p><p class="calibre10">A conversation not uncommon within the tired mess hall.</p><p class="calibre10">Roused was the once-sleeping sword of war, trained now upon battlefields of burgeoning ferocity.  The Orders could do little else but oblige, and so sent their great number to certain death.  Officers&mdash;all of them&mdash;wore their fatigued faces with a constant dread.</p><p class="calibre10">And there was Mt. Godrika.  Yes, dreaded Godrika, woeful site of our dear sacrifices two years past; Central apparently took heed of our enumerated dead, and ordered that adjustments be made to the 5th’s organisational structure.  Likely an attempt at distancing the precious offspring of the aristocracy from the most belligerent of battlefields.  But by now, it was evident enough that those pampered princes and princesses could only remain sheltered from the flames of war for so long.</p><p class="calibre10">And so it was that the 5th lost its lustre as a calm strait, through which the more careerist-minded recruits found safe passage to the waters of opportunity, once upon a time.  Indeed, the nobles have all but lost their haven.  The battles numbered overmany, stretched overfar, and craved overmuch.</p><p class="calibre10">Or perhaps it was even before Godrika that the signs were scrawled in the sand.  Yes…  Erbelde&mdash;at its foundation, that battle was little more than a foray into the lands of our foe, all to seize the fertile basin flowing therein.  The kindling for the great war-fire was already smouldering by that point.  And now we stood, witnessing before us its full ardour.  These days, nary a year wheels by that an officer finds himself unsent to the frontlines.</p><p class="calibre10">Little wonder, then, that on the daily, the soldiery of the Order was so spent of spirit and burdened of body.</p><p class="calibre10">The stress, the anger, the frustration&mdash;who better to take it out on than an ungraced?</p><p class="calibre10">“Want-witted wastrel!  What’s your business, ah!?  Weakest of us all, an’ here you’ve the nerve to yet draw breath!  Whilst our mates file out and make battle!”</p><p class="calibre10">Another scene, one upon the training grounds: a knight berating me with both voice and fist.</p><p class="calibre10">“They come back to us in coffins, I’ll have you know!  Coffins!  Samuel gave his life, he did!  All that you might housekeep behind the comfort of these walls!”</p><p class="calibre10">It would seem he lost a comrade in a prior battle.  The anger it roused proved too great a burden on his heart, and so he sought to share the load, as it were.  A tiring bout of violence, all but for a moment of precious equilibrium.</p><p class="calibre10">“Sinning scum!” he spat, kicking my back as I lay in the dirt.  And as the strike landed, so too did the noontide bell.</p><p class="calibre10">“Training’s over, lads and lasses.  Hurry up and get your lunches over with, yea?” ordered the instructor.</p><p class="calibre10">A member of the leadership in his own right&mdash;brigadier to the Cavalry Brigade.  The other officers heeded him well, for they then dispersed in droves.</p><p class="calibre10">“Ey, <i class="calibre3">alga,”</i> he looked down to me.  “Make yourself useful, at least, eh?  Keep getting laid low right quick like that, and soon even the shite under my shoe will fetch a finer reugol than you.”</p><p class="calibre10">With those cutting words, the instructor himself quit the training grounds.  The only soul left was I, spread upon the dirt like an old rag.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p>

<p class="calibre10">Noon passed on an ordinary day.  There, I was met with a most unordinary visitor.</p><p class="calibre10">“Lord Rolf,” she greeted brightly.  Maria&mdash;the young maidservant of House Mernesse.  I was merely sat in a corner of the mess hall when I found myself in her company.  “I am pleased to find you well after all these winters.”</p><p class="calibre10">Long has it been since I’ve last been addressed so highly, must less spoken to with such deference.  It was almost enough to whisk me off my chair.</p><p class="calibre10">“Likewise, dear Maria,” I returned.  “You’ve grown&mdash;how old are you now?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’ve turned fourteen not a long while ago.”</p><p class="calibre10">She carried herself with the air and conduct of an adult, yet retained a juvenile vestige upon her face.  Indeed, though she had waited upon Emilie since her tinier days, those accumulated years still found Maria to be a child at her present age.</p><p class="calibre10">If memory serves, the last I’ve seen of her was on the day I departed the Buckmann barony for good.  She stood there at Emilie’s side amidst a gathering crowd, clasping dearly to her mistress’ hands.  The look upon her little face told of an innocent sorrow at seeing off her beloved Emilie, so ready as the latter was to embark upon a new path at the Order.</p><p class="calibre10">The two were precious to one another.  Maria adored Emilie with the whole of her heart, while for her part, Emilie lovingly doted upon the little girl.</p><p class="calibre10">“You’ve come here on business, I take it?” I asked, cognizant of the conspicuous timing.</p><p class="calibre10">“I have, m’lord, to attend to a herald from Master Mernesse.  He meets with the Lady Emilie at present,” Maria answered eloquently.</p><p class="calibre10">“I see.  To discuss the engagement, no doubt.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…Yes, m’lord.”</p><p class="calibre10">The past few days have found our young mareschal to be torn of spirit.  Emilie was fracted, brooding&mdash;a bird beset by skies of rain, as it were.  What’s more, she’d given me leave of two days from my swainly duties.</p><p class="calibre10">For what reason?  Hard to say.  Something about wishing to hole up in her chamber and devote more of her energies to her obligations.</p><p class="calibre10">Though now given new light by Maria, none would be a fool to imagine that her engagement was the culprit of her recent character, what with a herald flying here straight from the perch that was the Mernesse estate itself.  After all, her betrothed, Kenneth of Albeck, was to turn sixteen this year.</p><p class="calibre10">The hourglass had finally run its course, it seemed.</p><p class="calibre10">My formerly betrothed, now off into the arms of another.</p><p class="calibre10">The mere thought of it was as thorns wound tightly about my heart.</p><p class="calibre10">“Very kind of you to come and congratulate Emilie, Maria,” I said, in the midst of such ruminations.  “You always were the one smitten with her.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Your words are ever warm,” Maria smiled faintly, now sat across from me.  “Though I am come today not for m’lady, but for you, Lord Rolf.”</p><p class="calibre10">“For me?” I blinked.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes…” fell Maria’s voice.</p><p class="calibre10">Her words then ceased, a flow seemingly dammed up in her own heart, for moments passed before she could gather the courage to speak further.</p><p class="calibre10">“…The Lady Emilie…” Maria began again, shaking her head, “…she must not… she must not be made to marry…  Not to the young lord of Albeck.”</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">“Maria,” I began carefully, my ears yet reeling from her most unexpected words.  “What’s this, so asudden?”</p><p class="calibre10">Her answer came neither immediately nor matched to any rhythm of conversation.  Rather, she sat there, shrunk and shivering in silence, her shaded regard distantly drifting down to the featureless table.</p><p class="calibre10">‘She must not be made to marry the young lord of Albeck.’</p><p class="calibre10">Her words of moments before.  It was unthinkable for a servant to air even a whisper of dissent against her mistress’ betrothal.  But to say outright that the arrangement must not come to pass?</p><p class="calibre10">This was grave.</p><p class="calibre10">Certainly no small degree of bravery was needed on Maria’s part to show her heart so.  Thus did I refrain from forcing the matter, according her all the time she needed to continue.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Eight winters past…” she said, almost in a whisper, to which I nodded.  “…I lived here in Norden.  My parents passed asudden, and so I was given to my uncle’s care.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I see…”</p><p class="calibre10">“He partook of the bottle from the light of one morrow to the next, and dallied in debt-making wherever he went.”  Pity left me quiet.  Maria resumed.  “Till one day… visitors were come to our home&mdash;frightful ones.  And there, they soon came to quarrel with Uncle.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Visitors of the vicious sort, I take it?” I asked.</p><p class="calibre10">“Indeed.  The moneyers’ men, to be precise…  ‘We’ll take her as payment,’ they said.  And then… th-they… they bagged me up… but not before… k… k-killing Uncle…”</p><p class="calibre10">Now did her quivering begin to infect her words.  It was painfully apparent to me by then that it was not the table that her downcast eyes saw, but a scene&mdash;sore and sorrowful, a memory never meant to be treasured.</p><p class="calibre10">“…They kept me locked in some dark place.  Besides myself, there… there were two others.  One, of about thirty years of age.  And the other, twenty, thereabouts.  Both were women…”</p><p class="calibre10">Her voice now tearfully ebbed.  I had a mind to stay her from recounting the hurtful memory any further, but chose to stay myself instead.  This was Maria’s resolve.  Long was the journey her words took to reach my ears.  There was naught to do but listen.</p><p class="calibre10">“I… I could not tell the manner of the day…  All the walls were windowless…  But ‘twas perhaps three days…  And in all that time, I was trapped there.  At the end, we had visitors, both well-attired…  A man in his thirties, and… and a boy, not much older than I was.”</p><p class="calibre10">…A boy?</p><p class="calibre10">What ill.</p><p class="calibre10">“T… to us, they looked… a-and said…”</p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">‘Well now, what a winsome waist this one has.  The eldest bint of the bunch, hm?  Ah, yes, truly… alluring, I must say.’</i></p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">‘What of these other two, daddy?  Can I have them?’</i></p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">‘No no, my boy.  The little one is mine.’</i></p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">‘Mmm, fine then.  Little ones last too short a while, anyway.’</i></p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">‘Try not to kill your share so soon this time, will you?’</i></p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">‘But I can’t help it, daddy.  Slicing ‘em up’s such fun…’</i></p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">‘The slicing’s best left for their last days; how many times must I remind you, my boy?  Savour them softly now, and they may yet keep for a good year.’</i></p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">…was Maria’s harrowingly meticulous account.</p><p class="calibre10">No memory so deeply engraved by the chisel of fear could be so easily worn away by the plane of time.  What now echoed in Maria’s ears was undoubtedly the vulgar glee of the man and his son.</p><p class="calibre10">“…They shackled us to each other… and had us boarded up on a canvased carriage,” Maria went on.  “…I… I was tr… trembling… all the way…”</p><p class="calibre10">Her youthful face wrinkled heartwrenchingly.  I looked on, silenced by her emotion.</p><p class="calibre10">“W… we wended our way up a mountain pass…  There, a pack of droll-hounds waylaid us.  In their fright, the men… they threw me down from the carriage…  ‘A bait for the beasts,’ they said.  And then… and then they left.”</p><p class="calibre10">It was my dearest intention to listen as calmly as I could.  But before I knew it, I found my hands clenched white, nails digging into my palms.</p><p class="calibre10">“I watched the carriage drive away… thinking this was my end, to be eaten up by the beasts…  But ‘twas not to be.  A bullboar happened asudden upon the pack and attacked them.  The hounds darted away, and the bullboar gave chase…  And then… I was alone.”</p><p class="calibre10">The solitude&mdash;haunting, even now.</p><p class="calibre10">“I had no one left… no place to go… and so I wandered the road… till I crossed paths with a passing caravan.  The merchants there helped me… kind they were,” Maria’s face softened.  “A search was sent out later on for the man and his son, as well as the other women… but ‘twas all for naught.”</p><p class="calibre10">Naught&mdash;on account of a cold trail?  Or was the probe barred by the powers that be?</p><p class="calibre10">A hateful reality that it was likely the latter, I suspected, for ‘well-attired’ was Maria’s assessment of the wretched duo.  Likely again was their aristocratic status, a caste of customers fain for the cruel trade.</p><p class="calibre10">“…Thereafter, I was given to the orphans’ workhouses, and put through a program for us lost children, where we might find some humble employ in the estates of high society.  ‘Twas by that path that I was made a maidservant to House Mernesse.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I see… so that is your story.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ever and always has the Lady Emilie treated me preciously, low-born though I may be.  In my heart, she is a dear sister to me…” Maria faintly smiled, but the mirth quickly faded away.  “…And ‘twas why I could scarcely draw breath when not a few days ago, we were visited by m’lady’s betrothed and his father, the viscount of Albeck.”</p><p class="calibre10">The dots aligned.</p><p class="calibre10">“Father and son…  It was <i class="calibre3">them,</i> I take it?” I asked quietly, yet firmly.  “You’re certain of this, Maria?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, m’lord.  My eyes knew their faces at once.  The man and the boy; no doubt they were the Viscount Albeck and his eldest son, the young Kenneth&mdash;m’lady’s betrothed.”</p><p class="calibre10">What nightmare is this?</p><p class="calibre10">Nay.  To Maria, this was a crushing reality, one that was upheaving her world right as we spoke.  A word as flimsy as “nightmare” could not hope to preface her poor fate.</p><p class="calibre10">“Have you spoken of this to anyone else?” I asked again.  “What of the baron?  Is he apprised?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Nay, m’lord.  You are the first to hear of this,” Maria answered clearly.  “Master Mernesse&mdash;he can ill-endure so dire a blow as another annulled engagement for his dear daughter.  Given his fraught circumstance, I fear he’ll lend not an ear to my accusation, grounded as it is in a memory of eight winters past.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And one from a child not more than six years of age at the time, no less.  Indeed, there’s not a viscount in this realm that would suffer such a slight…”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes.  My fears exactly,” said Maria, before nervously wending her eyes back up to meet mine.  “But… would you… would you trust in my words, Lord Rolf?  ‘Tis of faint substance, I know, bu&mdash;”</p><p class="calibre10">“I would, Maria.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…R… really…?”</p><p class="calibre10">My immediate answer had earned an honest surprise from her tear-shaded face.  An expression of childlike innocence, the first she has shown me all day.</p><p class="calibre10">“M’lord…  I am ever grateful.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Listen well now, Maria.  I’m the only soul you’ve sought to tell of this; let it stay that way.  This means leaving Emilie out of this affair.  I’ll handle the rest,” I whispered strongly, leaning in.   “I should apologise.  For now, you’ll just have to bear with keeping a secret from your dear mistress.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Not at all, m’lord,” she shook her head.  “I’ll put my fullest trust in you, just as you’ve put yours in me.”</p><p class="calibre10">Trust?</p><p class="calibre10">How warm a word.  One I was most glad to receive.</p><p class="calibre10">My days as a disdained ungraced had long dulled me to the goodwill of others.  But through Maria was I reminded of how immeasurably precious it was to be so trusted by another.</p><p class="calibre10">A flicker in the heart.</p><p class="calibre10">My resolve was set.</p><p class="calibre10">Maria’s trust&mdash;I would not betray it.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">Into the 5th’s library the both of us went, and through its collection of almanacks we combed.  An annual on the affairs of the aristocracy&mdash;within it, we discovered the particulars of the Viscount Albeck.</p><p class="calibre10">Many times was he wed.  And of the wives, not less than five were deceased.</p><p class="calibre10">“Death by accident”.</p><p class="calibre10">Each parted spouse, unceremoniously written off by those three words.  No doubt the fangs of foul play were at work here&mdash;fangs now bared to Emilie herself, unbeknownst.</p><p class="calibre10">Perhaps for this occasion, they would file off their hedonist fangs for good?  But even then, allowing Emilie to enter the den of such a fell family did not sit well.  Not with me.</p><p class="calibre10">Something had to be done.</p><p class="calibre10">Only, Emilie must not be apprised of this foul affair.  At least, not till this gameboard had run its course.  She was the queen piece, but to move her would prove an immediate blunder.  Most certainly, she would endeavour to dissolve the engagement were she wise to the nature of her betrothed, but therein lay the rub: we had no proof.</p><p class="calibre10">Breaking off the betrothal on unsubstantiated grounds would backfire upon House Mernesse with irresistible force, and the wound would prove fatal: Emilie and her family, forever as pariahs in the aristocratic sphere.</p><p class="calibre10">And that’s to say nothing of the blood, sweat, and tears Emilie had shed to faithfully carry out the office of mareschal, that House Mernesse might endure.  Were she to be shunned by the nobility, all of it would be as nothing.</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes…” agreed Maria, after I sorted aloud the potential situation.  “That seems most reasonable to me, as well.”</p><p class="calibre10">The gameboard was set, then.  We now knew our play.</p><p class="calibre10">Find palpable proof.  Report it to the authorities.  Bring forth an indictment.  There was no other way.  But House Mernesse must not be made to involve itself in the indictment.  This was the catch, and to play along with it, I would have to act alone and in the shadows.</p><p class="calibre10">The days till the wedding ceremony were numbered.  Against the trickling hourglass, I steeled my resolve all at once.</p><p class="calibre10">“Dear Maria,” I kneeled before the young maidservant.  “The way is set; I make for the viscounty of Albeck at eventide.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Yes, m’lord,” she nodded.  “For my part, I’ll be staying here through the night, and on the morrow make my return to the Mernesse residence.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Right.”  I rose back to my feet, and urged her thusly.  “And just so we’re clear: not a word is to reach Emilie’s ears.  Promise me this, Maria!”</p><p class="calibre10">“I do promise,” she answered with a bow, after which I began my brisk way out of the library, but not before hearing from behind me Maria’s voice one last time.  “Pray, do be safe, Lord Rolf.”</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">By steed, I sped through the starry evenlight, the dusking roads pointing me to the edge of Norden.  Beyond it loomed the neighbouring viscounty of Albeck.</p><p class="calibre10">Twilight darkened into moonlight.  Far up the highroad emerged a gatepost, manned by guards and brightened by braziers.</p><p class="calibre10">A border check.  I’d suspected the main paths would be barred so.  Not yet had I left the march of Norden, but already was I met with measures against any interlopers of untoward intent.</p><p class="calibre10">Such stringent security was typically a luxury employed by some of the more esteemed peers of the nobility&mdash;counts and higher up, namely&mdash;but House Albeck hung on a lower rung of that social ladder.  Unusual, but given their criminal character, not unreasonable: doubtless there were many shadowed things that the lord of Albeck wished to hide behind bristling ranks of men.</p><p class="calibre10">I veered off the highroad and drove instead into the valley&mdash;cautiously.  Time was of the essence, and the night would only wane from here on out, but I had little choice: braving the less-beaten paths was preferable to drawing suspicion from the viscount’s men.  Fortunately, the benighted empty was flush with moonglow, thus was I able to gallop through the darkened hours unhindered.</p><p class="calibre10">The detour proved the right path.  By the next morrow’s noontide, I found myself clear within the viscounty.</p><p class="calibre10">A town.  Through it I went, along the way learning from the folk of the way to their lord’s manor.  By their words, it was situated not far from the locality itself.  I awayed at once.</p><p class="calibre10">The open country led to a patch of hilled woods.  Riding through the shaded evergreen, I soon spied a manor distantly peeping through the canopy.  The viscount’s lair, no doubt.  I cantered off to the side and up a hillock, from the summit of which I surveyed the residence.</p><p class="calibre10">Its grounds were nestled within a trimmed and tended clearing.  And it was well-guarded: walls encircled the entire premises, whilst men kept watch about its gatehouse.</p><p class="calibre10">Breaking into the mansion, making off with some evidence of the cruelties indulged within…  Certainly the most expedient way to go about things.  Only, the “how” of it was the rub.  Perhaps I should approach from the back?</p><p class="calibre10">In the course of my cogitation, I scanned through the area.</p><p class="calibre10">Movement.</p><p class="calibre10">Far off in the veiled distance: a convoy of carriages coming up this way.</p><p class="calibre10">Horse-drawn wagons, to be exact, each with their loads canvased.  Goods for the good lord, perhaps?  Might prove useful.</p><p class="calibre10">Dismounting from my steed, I stooped low, then scurried through the shrubbery and down the slope, creeping closer to the wagons’ path.  A distraction was needed, something to anchor the drivers’ eyes with.  I glanced about for options, finding a large tree nearby, snapped from its stump and lying flat upon the foliage.  This, I’ll use.</p><p class="calibre10">Working quickly, I heaved and turned the tree till it was parallel to the manor-bound highroad.  Low again, I waited.  The hoof-falls and wheel-dragging loudened.  As the procession of wagons approached, I kicked the tree.</p><p class="calibre10">Down the hillock it tumbled.  The escorts blared their voices at the scare, taking it to be some work of banditry or connivery.</p><p class="calibre10">No time to waste.  In the commotion, I slinked away from the scene and made my way around to the opposite side of the hillock before descending the slope there.  Through the bushes, I wound about in a half-circle to the procession’s rear.</p><p class="calibre10">Up to the last of the wagons, I approached.  With the eyes of the escorts firmly trained away from me, I then thought to steal a peek into the wagon’s contents.</p><p class="calibre10">Foodstuffs?</p><p class="calibre10">Naught but a “banal” affair to be found here, as it were.  I had a mind to chance upon some evidence, but it would seem my stint in espionage won’t be ending soon.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet the foodstuffs&mdash;certainly not too valuable a load.  It well-explained the wagons’ smattering of escorts and their relative lack of apprehension.  Despite the load’s meagre worth, it was thanks to it that I was able to sneak my way to the procession’s midst, an invaluable opportunity in and of itself.</p><p class="calibre10">Should I hide in one of the wagons?</p><p class="calibre10">Nay&mdash;their decks will all be checked at the gatehouse, to be sure.</p><p class="calibre10">There’s no helping it.  I crouched down low and slid beneath the wagon.  To its underside, I clung tightly: arms braced about the rear axle and legs wrapped around the reach.  A painful position, to be sure, but this was no time to complain.</p><p class="calibre10">Before long, the wagons went about their way once more, their escorts having deduced the fallen tree to be nothing more than a fluke, and the area to be absent of hostiles.  Only, they neglected to check their shadows, for a stowaway now clung along for the shaky ride.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">“The usual grub, eh?  Right then, bring ‘em all in.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Aye, ser.”</p><p class="calibre10">The wagons were wheeled into the manor premises, the requisite load inspections having been completed without a hitch.  Merchants and men of the manor both were locked in conversation.  From here on, the foodstuffs would be brought into the residence.</p><p class="calibre10">The guards then sauntered back to their posts; the merchants commenced their labour.  I waited under the wagon, and at the moment I suspected all eyes were turned away, I quickly crawled out.  With caution shrinking my gait low, I slinked towards the manor proper and into the nearest entryway.</p><p class="calibre10">No one in sight.</p><p class="calibre10">“So far, so good…” I mouthed.</p><p class="calibre10">Obtaining proof of the Albecks’ offences would require infiltrating the very spot in which they were committed.  After all, there wouldn’t be something so conveniently damning as a ledger lying around.  The viscount and his son were involved in trafficking&mdash;if there was proper proof to be had, it would be in the victims themselves.  Should any such poor souls still be in the premises, it’d be best to rescue them and gain their testimony.</p><p class="calibre10">This, I reasoned in my head, whilst the rest of my body had already begun making way further into the mansion.</p><p class="calibre10">But there was something… “odd”, about this place.</p><p class="calibre10">A drawing room in the eastern wing was where I ended up, but its layout differed from what I had gleaned from my survey of the manor.  From the outside, the room appeared to be deeper by about two passūs, yet here the missing depth was walled off instead.</p><p class="calibre10">I glanced and glared all about the facade, till my eyes spied an unassuming notch.</p><p class="calibre10">“A dent…?” I whispered, feeling the small feature with my fingers.  “No… a handle.”</p><p class="calibre10">The “wall” was but a sliding panel, and so with a hand on the handle, I had it opened.  Beyond it was a sunless space.</p><p class="calibre10">“Mmm?” mumbled a sleepy voice.  A guard, taken by a bout of drowsiness, looked up from his nodding half-nap.  “Me shift’s over already?”</p><p class="calibre10">“It is now.”</p><p class="calibre10">Before our eyes could meet, my fist flashed through the side of his jaw.  The resulting concussion had him crumpling to the floor.</p><p class="calibre10">Working with all speed, I unravelled his belts, and with them had his hands and feet bound tight.  The last, I saved for his mouth.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“…rrh…!  …mmrh…!”</i> came his muffled slur, till silence took him entirely.</p><p class="calibre10">Quickly again, I relieved his person of a conspicuous key, and with it, passed through a door looming further in.  Behind it was revealed a set of stairs, the steps diving down into the dark.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Tch…”</i></p><p class="calibre10">There at the bottom was I beset by an evil scene.  Anticipating signs of sinning was one thing, but beholding them in the flesh was another: the bedevilled sight before me earned an immediate and involuntary click from my tongue.</p><p class="calibre10">Besmirching the stone floor were washes of dried blood, as well as an array of torturous implements scattered about.  Ledges lined the walls, each appointed with all manner of blades, needles, and whips.  But there was one wall that wasn’t, for instead it was composed of iron bars spanning from floor to ceiling.</p><p class="calibre10">A gaol cell.</p><p class="calibre10">Inside it lay women, left with not a single scrap of clothing upon their bare skin.</p><p class="calibre10">I stepped closer.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ha…ah…!”</i> whimpered their low, hopeless voices, and at the sight of me, they shrank back to the wall.</p><p class="calibre10">The women numbered three&mdash;each wounded pitifully all throughout their bodies.</p><p class="calibre10">“Easy now.  I’ve come to help,” I assured them, undoing the lock and swinging the iron bars open.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ah…!  Aah!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Yet none of the victims therein ventured a step towards their freedom.  With no other choice, I entered the gaol myself and approached them.</p><p class="calibre10">“N… no!  P-please… no…!” one of the women yelped, who then began flailing her arms and legs about.  The desperate effort to keep me away was tangible.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ach</i>&mdash;easy, I said,” I tried to soothe, taking a blow to chin and cheek both.  “I’ll not hurt any of you, I swear it.”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Aaah!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">My words were of no avail.  The sands of the hourglass flowed dearly.  I would have liked very much to at once liberate these women from this little corner of hell, but to take them by the hand, unwilling and untrusting as they were, ran the risk of injuring further their frail persons.</p><p class="calibre10">The bewildered woman&mdash;I braced my face against her pitifully flailing hands, gazed with calm into her eyes, and attempted again to allay her fears.</p><p class="calibre10">“Listen.  I’ve come to expose the viscount’s crimes; I would have him unmasked for the fiend that he is, but know that saving you here serves not only that purpose,” I spoke as steadily as I could.  The sorry struggle ceased in answer.  “Your loved ones.  They’re all waiting for you back home, yes?  I’ll see to it that you are returned to them&mdash;safe and sound.”</p><p class="calibre10">Slowly, the woman’s eyes met mine. <i class="calibre3">“Ah… aa…”</i></p><p class="calibre10">“My name’s Rolf,” I continued.  “Have you all families?  Friends?  Anyone at all that may worry over your absence?  If not, then at least take comfort in this: I, myself, wish to see you all freed and well upon your paths.  And I say again: I would have it done.”</p><p class="calibre10">A heavy quiet grew between us all.</p><p class="calibre10">“It’s all right, Ina.  He’s not one of them,” rang a voice from the corner.  “See what he wears?  Different, isn’t it?”</p><p class="calibre10">From the murk stepped forth the third woman.  Curls of carrot-hue hung to her shoulders, and with large, dazzling eyes and a gracefully slender figure, one would be forgiven for mistaking her presence for that of a cat’s.</p><p class="calibre10">“Quite the courageous one, aren’t you?” her eyes narrowed at mine.  “I am naked, in case you’ve not noticed.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Apologies.  You seem lithe&mdash;exceptionally so.  I took you for a sword-adept; one who earns her coin by the blade, no less.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And you took me right,” she smiled.  “The name’s Frieda, a freelance from ‘round these parts.  I came by commission of the authorities, seeking proof of the viscount’s criminality.  Didn’t turn out as I’d hoped, as you can see,” she shook her head.  “‘Rolf’, was it?  You have my trust, big lad.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And you have my thanks.  I take it your employers have briefed you on the situation.  That saves us time.  We leave now,” I said, then turning to the two other women before me.  “You’re Ina, yes?  And what of you, miss?”</p><p class="calibre10">“C-Carola, good ser,” the second woman stammered, before looking to the first.  “Ina, he’s not one of the viscount’s villains.  See?  It’s all right.”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Aah…”</i> Ina began to speak brokenly.  “Y… yes… I… I’m sorry…”</p><p class="calibre10">“You’ve nothing to be sorry about, Ina.  But we must leave, and quickly,” I said, softly yet assuredly.  “Pains me to say, but I’m dim to the mending magicks&mdash;how fare your injuries?  Can you all walk?”</p><p class="calibre10">“That I can.”</p><p class="calibre10">“As can I,” Carola nodded.  “Ina?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Y-yes, I-I think.”</p><p class="calibre10">The trio were weakened from their many wounds, but by their words, they were well enough for the escape ahead.  I gave a nod myself and left the gaol.  The rest followed, but before we began our climb up the stairs, a peculiarity piqued my eye.  Across from the gaol cell spanned a long shelf, upon which rested a row of countless skulls.</p><p class="calibre10">Frieda followed my gaze.  Her voice bit with bitterness.  “Long-lost offerings, they are&mdash;to the lord and his boy.”</p><p class="calibre10">Regret seemed to sigh from the skulls’ many sockets.  Beholding them, I darkly clenched my teeth and stepped towards the stairs.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">“Tr-trespasser, is it!?”</p><p class="calibre10">A gasp from another guard greeted us as we surfaced from the stairway, this one leaning over his concussed and belt-bound colleague.  Likely just arrived to relieve his mate of watch duty.</p><p class="calibre10">And right as he caught sight of me, the sentinel scrambled to unsheathe his sword.  I acted in tandem, charging up the stairs with a freshly drawn blade of my own.</p><p class="calibre10">Naught but a hidden room this was, dark and confined: my opponent’s blade rose, only to bite the low ceiling.</p><p class="calibre10">A moment of clumsiness.</p><p class="calibre10">Seizing it, I brandished my own blade in a precise arc.</p><p class="calibre10">Iron sharpness flew through the tight quarters.</p><p class="calibre10">The air whistled.  A thumb then spun through it, cleanly severed.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Hyeh!?”</i> the guard whimpered, letting his sword fall from his bloodied hand.</p><p class="calibre10">But not before a hand of my own caught his face.</p><p class="calibre10">With the full weight of my body, I rammed his head into the stonework wall.  An immediate knockout: the guard collapsed completely, joining his comrade on the ground.</p><p class="calibre10">“Wh… oi!  What’s that, just now?” Frieda whispered loudly from behind, her mouth agape.  “Where’d you get chops like that, eh?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Chops?” I blinked, before turning instead to salvage the guard’s sword.  To our mercenary it went.  “I chopped his finger.  What of it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Not that ‘chop’&mdash;nevermind,” Frieda interrupted herself, taking the blade.</p><p class="calibre10">The four of us then emerged into the drawing room proper and sidled up against the wall near the doorway.  With an ear pressed upon the surface, I listened.</p><p class="calibre10">“…next lass… her ready…”</p><p class="calibre10">“…sellsword’s next too… young master Kenneth’s had his fill…”</p><p class="calibre10">Vague conversations yonder.</p><p class="calibre10">Six voices, was it?  Perhaps more.  I couldn’t tell; not from here.</p><p class="calibre10">Nonetheless, our options grew scant.  Dire straits awaited were we to be met with magicks from any of those men.  And forcing our way through with Ina and Carola in tow, vulnerable as they were, was to beckon the fates’ foul humour.</p><p class="calibre10">“The way is barred,” I whispered, shaking my head.  “We search for another.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I’m sorry.  None of us knows the exact lay of the mansion,” Frieda confessed.  “How do you reckon we quit this place?”</p><p class="calibre10">“The front bristles with guards at the gatehouse, from what I’ve seen…  We ought to flee from the side, but not through the east where we are now.  No&mdash;the west.  There’s a stable and a small gate there.  That’s where we’ll aim.  What think you all?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Fine enough for me,” Frieda nodded.  “The first floor, though…  ‘Tis a pinch too perilous for us to snoop about here, I think.  Best we move up to the second.  Chances are, there’s a window in the west wing we can drop from.”</p><p class="calibre10">“The second floor?” Carola shivered at the thought.  “Is… is it safe up there?”</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Safer’ is more the word, but it’s no guarantee.  Both Frieda and I will keep you two from harm, that much I can promise,” I assured. “Viscount Albeck… I’ve a hunch that he’s not a man to suffer the low-born upon the higher floors.  We can expect fewer guards up there.”</p><p class="calibre10">“My thoughts exactly,” said Frieda, looking to the other girls with a soothing smile.</p><p class="calibre10">Nods of agreement from each of us.</p><p class="calibre10">I then listened further for activity, and hearing naught, cracked the door open and peeked through.  No guards now in sight; the prior men must’ve moved off.  But by Frieda’s words, the first floor should be teeming with more of the viscount’s varlets.  An upward stairway loomed not far off; that would be our immediate destination.</p><p class="calibre10">Carefully, but with hearts drumming, we exited the drawing room, scurrying to and up the stairs.  At the top, we found ourselves at the eastern wing of the second floor.  Our next destination awaited at the very opposite side of the mansion; a gruelling prospect, to cross so uncertain a distance.</p><p class="calibre10">Our group stepped to it.  Frieda manned the rear, and I the front.  We soon came upon our first turn of the corridor.  To the corner wall we congregated.</p><p class="calibre10">Slowly, I chanced a glimpse at the adjoining hall…</p><p class="calibre10">A guard.  He sauntered our way, oblivious.</p><p class="calibre10">I signalled to the others to stay where they were before pressing myself up against the wall.</p><p class="calibre10">There, I waited with bated breath.</p><p class="calibre10">Unhurried footfalls neared.</p><p class="calibre10">Fear frayed Ina and Carola’s nerves in the meanwhile.  But a comforting hand from Frieda alighted upon their shoulders, and looking up, they found upon her face both a faint mirth and a reassuring nod.  A well-steeled woman she was, despite suffering her own fair share of horrors in this hell-house.</p><p class="calibre10">Just then, the guard began to turn the corner.</p><p class="calibre10">I lunged at him, seizing his collars and jerking him towards me.  Then with a twist of my shoulders, I sent his scalp straight into the corner wall.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Agh&mdash;!?”</i> he yelped, before fading into silence.</p><p class="calibre10">“Showy, are we?” came Frieda’s comment.</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Lucky’ is more like it,” I sighed in relief.  “And looks like we guessed right&mdash;only the more esteemed guards are to be found here.”</p><p class="calibre10">“True, if our ‘lucky’ lad here is any indication,” said Frieda, eyeing the embroidered mantle and cape enshrouding the downed guard&mdash;raiments of great luxury in our moment of need.  Hastily, I undressed the man, and then handed the mantle and cape to Ina and Carola.</p><p class="calibre10">“Th-thank you.”</p><p class="calibre10">“My gratitude… Ser Rolf.”</p><p class="calibre10">The two then donned their bare bodies with the boon of clothes.  It wouldn’t have been wise to take the window curtains for this same purpose; the men outside surely would have sensed something was amiss.</p><p class="calibre10">And that I was able to disable the guard without a single swing of the sword was most fortuitous indeed.  Ina and Carola had suffered enough; to drape them in blood-drenched fabrics would have teased from their hearts recollections too wretched to bear.</p><p class="calibre10">“Right.  On we go&mdash;softly now,” I whispered to the others, but not before binding this guard too with his own belts.  To the shade was his limp body tucked, and then down the corridor our group crept, caution guiding our course.</p><p class="calibre10">My hunch proved true: the second floor really was empty of the manor’s sentries.  The guard earlier was the only soul we’ve crossed thus far.  Hence were we able to reach the west wing without further trouble.  It was there that we soon found ourselves gathered about a double doorway, beyond which was the lord’s study.</p><p class="calibre10">But convenience was a contrivance of the fates, for here ended our ease: whiling within were multiple men.</p><p class="calibre10">Slowly, I cracked one of the doors open, just enough to let the voices inside seep out.</p><p class="calibre10">“…then, dear daddy.  I trust the good messenger from Mernesse makes his way to the 5th?”</p><p class="calibre10">“You trust well.  The Order should have welcomed him no more than two nights ago.  And I made certain that he is well-apprised of the wedding’s day and time, details ready to meet your fair lady’s ears.”</p><p class="calibre10">Hearing such, I turned to the others.  Frieda simply nodded, but the other two had all hale sapped from their faces.  The fear in their eyes implicated the voices as being none other than their oppressors’: the Viscount Albeck and his heir, Kenneth.</p><p class="calibre10">“Oh, my loins!  Afire they are!” sang the son.  “My bride-to-be… a mareschal, she is!  You don’t suppose she’d expire too soon were I a bit… <i class="calibre3">rough</i> with her, do you daddy?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Not at all, my boy.  She is the vaunted Lady Emilie Mernesse, no less.  Liberator of Godrika, whisperer of the levinblade&mdash;her strength is attested, I can assure  you.  Why, they say she is the dame to succeed Tiselius herself!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Vaunted, indeed!” cackled Kenneth.  “Ah, such a winsome woman… all <i class="calibre3">mine!</i> Oh, if only it were the wedding night!”</p><p class="calibre10">“A fine wife I’ve chosen for you, if I do say so myself,” the viscount said smilingly.  “I’ll not stay your hand from breaking her to pieces, but do be a bit more gentle, will you?  She may yet please you for a longer while, my boy.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You’re hardly one to speak of treasuring toys, daddy!” the adolescent giggled again.  “But I’m afraid her limbs won’t stay on for long; I’ll savour their sweet severing as soon as I’m able.  Yes… nipped from the knees and elbows down.  A barking bitch, I’ll make of her!  Leashed and collared!  Oh!  And for her abode: not a dungeon, but a doghouse!”</p><p class="calibre10">A sneer from the lord.  “Your fidelity is moving.”</p><p class="calibre10">My blood boiled.</p><p class="calibre10">Anger pulsed through my arteries and straight into my head.</p><p class="calibre10">No.  I couldn’t.</p><p class="calibre10">This was a battlefield in and of itself.  There were hostiles about, victims to rescue&mdash;surrendering all composure was tantamount to admitting defeat.</p><p class="calibre10">Deeply, I filled my lungs and slowly exhaled.  Stilling the storm inside, I then took a peek through the cracked doorway.</p><p class="calibre10">A large desk.  There, the viscount was seated.  Across was his son, Kenneth, flanked by a guard on each side.  Cajoling jeers were plastered on the grunts’ faces as the nobles’ sinful talk slithered into their ears.</p><p class="calibre10">Four in total then.  Manageable.  We’ll break in and cuff them up.  Simple enough.</p><p class="calibre10">Frieda stood vis-à-vis, taking in the scene for herself.  Our eyes met; we nodded.  The guards would be mine to deal with, while Kenneth would be Frieda’s target.  The viscount, being the furthest from our reach, would be dealt with last.</p><p class="calibre10">By hand signs were such details relayed to Frieda, who gave another nod.</p><p class="calibre10">The lion’s share of the ambush would be mine to shoulder, but this was for the best.  By any measure was our mercenary exceptional with the sword, but loath was I to burden her any further than her tired and tortured body could bear.  She was as much a victim as Ina and Carola were.  This, I could not ignore.</p><p class="calibre10">Many souls in her line of work have I met during my outings in town.  All were imbued with the same iron-will; no doubt they would have turned their noses up to such a plan as this.  Indeed, those soldiers of fortune would be most fain to shoulder their fair share of the work, proud of heart as they were.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet I found agreement from Frieda without so much as a twinkle of discontent in her eyes.  She understood well the situation at hand, whether in regards to our foes’ numbers, or the spent state of her own body.  In her, I found a complice deserving of utmost trust as we stood face-to-face against the doorway.</p><p class="calibre10">One last look was shared between us.</p><p class="calibre10">Our wills were steeled.</p><p class="calibre10">The doors boomed open.</p><p class="calibre10">“Mm?” the viscount murmured, during which I was already in motion.  A tall cabinet stood beside the doorway: with a mighty heave, I toppled it over onto the left-standing guard.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Wagh!?”</i> the grunt yelped.  An oaken crash.  The floor rumbled.  The impelled piece of furniture was heavy indeed; he would not escape unscathed.</p><p class="calibre10">The other guard was quick to reveal his sword.  To me he sprinted, intent upon running me through with it.  This, I predicted&mdash;too close was he to Kenneth, his charge, and so could not dare to swing his sword broadly.</p><p class="calibre10">With a twist of my body, I let the blade pass through, and pouncing into his midst, I then thrust my elbow deep into the guard’s face.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Bwugh!!”</i> Air and spit spilled out of him as the full momentum of my body smashed  right into his nostrils.  Down to my side he collapsed, and from his person, I purloined a dagger.  It would not remain mine for long: at once, I wound about and hurled the little blade.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Gagh!?”</i> Deep into the thigh of the first guard it bit, who, after freeing himself from the downed cabinet, had thought to unsheathe his own sword.</p><p class="calibre10">Kenneth was left stunned, but the chaos continued.  Already was another blade sailing through the air, one in the hands of Frieda.  A ribbon of blood flew from the adolescent’s left arm.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Hyeh!?”</i> he yapped, stumbling from the fresh wound not longer than a mere thumb.  But it was one produced with astounding precision, a slice of the sword purposed to do no more than suppress the youth.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet the energy of the mercenary’s actions would not cease there: Frieda’s body breezed about and bounded right back into Kenneth’s midst.  The movement, brilliant in its use of her slender, featherweight form, ended with a heel diving straight into the adolescent’s knee.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Yiiuugh!!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">A cheap scream that concealed the sound of a broken kneecap.  The boy then fell to his bottom.  Not far from him was I, leaping onto the lord’s desk.  My sword free from its scabbard, I drove its pommel into the viscount’s visage.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Uogh!?”</i></p><p class="calibre10">The noble clamoured back, chair and all.  I dropped down, and standing at his side, trained my blade to his neck.  Frieda followed suit, bringing hers towards Kenneth’s nose.</p><p class="calibre10">So far, so good.</p><p class="calibre10">But the lord’s son was not one to stay quiet: he shrank back and opened his foul mouth.</p><p class="calibre10">“Wh-what’s this!?  Why are you here!?” Kenneth barked, pointing to Frieda. “A toy!  That’s what you are!  A plaything should know well to stay in the playpen!”</p><p class="calibre10">Fiery redness fumed from Frieda’s countenance.  Long had she shown composure in the course of our escape, but Kenneth’s ill words had at last unlocked from her heart a secret rage.  But the anger amounted to nothing more than an opening.  It was certain: for the briefest moment, Frieda’s judgement was blinded.</p><p class="calibre10">For his part, Kenneth seemed not the sort to concoct such cunning.  Frieda was but a doll to him, made for his pleasure and delight.  And so to weep and whimper in the face of her defiance was most unbecoming of him.  Yet that was his exact plight, and so what issued from his lips were merely words wrought wretchedly from the irony of it all.</p><p class="calibre10">The knife he then issued from his breast pocket was clearly not the kind for combat.  No, it was a dainty little thing, used only to cut up his “toys”, none of whom could’ve done more than let him have his way.</p><p class="calibre10">Up into the air it went, amidst the pathetic tears and screams of its wielder.</p><p class="calibre10">A knife, by chance imbued with precision.</p><p class="calibre10">A thrust of its blade, aimed at a chance opening.</p><p class="calibre10">To Frieda’s flank, it flew.</p><p class="calibre10">A cruel course closing in on her unguarded flesh.</p><p class="calibre10">Then&mdash;a sound, like a thundering thud.</p><p class="calibre10">Before thin iron could bite bare skin, the knife’s wielder was struck down whence he stood by whom but two more of his “toys”: in their bid to save Frieda, Ina and Carola had flown into the room, and with what might they could muster, threw themselves upon the depraved youth.</p><p class="calibre10">The sound of it all was like a bell to the mercenary, for the light of reason then returned to her eyes.  Once more, her blade bounded through the air…</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Nngyaagh!!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">…and with it, Kenneth’s ear and weeping wails.</p><p class="calibre10">Frieda stepped up to him.  Her next words were as cold as her steel, trained once more to the screaming, sobbing mess of a lordling.</p><p class="calibre10">“Still that tongue.  Or lose it.”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Hah… ah…!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Ten seconds.</p><p class="calibre10">Not more than ten seconds had passed since the doors were first flung open.  The fight was finished.  The nobles were captured.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">From the window of the west wing flew the lords of Albeck, father and son both.  Onto a haystack below they fell, for the most part unharmed by the landing, but being bound as they were, they could not flee.  Not that they had a mind to&mdash;their unceasing gripes had compelled Frieda and me to cudgel the wits out of them.</p><p class="calibre10">The four of us followed close behind.  With Ina on my back and Carola on Frieda’s, we climbed out of the window and descended by way of rain spouts.  At the bottom, we found ourselves right before the stables.  Just as planned.</p><p class="calibre10">Off into the shadows we scampered, and from there peered at the west gate over yonder.  The flanks of the manor were thinly surveilled, as we’d anticipated: not more than three men manned the secondary exit.</p><p class="calibre10">“Rolf, ‘twon’t be long ‘fore the lackeys catch a whiff of the stench we’ve cooked up in the manor,” whispered Frieda.  “Best we blast our way out ‘fore they’re sore fierce on our tail.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Then we move now.”</p><p class="calibre10">The longer we tarried about twiddling our thumbs, the more the fates were fain to have us fail in our flight.  Unflinching fearlessness was needed, with perhaps a pinch of recklessness: unlike my infiltration of the place, breaking out with a bang was a card I could now afford to play.</p><p class="calibre10">We helped ourselves to three steeds from the stable: one for Ina and I, another for Frieda and Carola, and the last for the Albecks.  Our captives were tied to their mount, the reins of which I held from afar.</p><p class="calibre10">“Ina, Carola.  Hold on tight,” I cautioned lowly.  “Worry not.  You’ll all be free before you know it.  Arrows, magicks&mdash;they’ll not harry us.  Our noble hostages here make for a fine shield.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Home’s on the horizon, loves!” soothed Frieda.  “Let’s move!”</p><p class="calibre10">Sudden hoof-falls filled the air&mdash;the gallops of three horses gunning for the west gate.</p><p class="calibre10">“Wh&mdash;!?”</p><p class="calibre10">“B-b-b-bloody ‘ell, they ‘ave us lords, they do!”</p><p class="calibre10">Blindsighted by our brazen escape, the guards did little but stand agape as we sped through their midst.</p><p class="calibre10">The getaway was as painless as it was successful.  We were free at last from the viscount’s haunt.  The west-side stables would provide our pursuers no avail, for we rode the only horses kept at them.  Whomever had a mind to wind about to the front and call for aid would have found the effort futile, for by then we will have long disappeared beyond the horizon.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">Our mounted escape carried us a few mīllia-passūs from the manor.  There, we stopped and dismounted on the banks of a brook running through the bottom of a verdant valley.  The sun was sunk below the mountains.  The skies blushed a wine-shade; night was falling.</p><p class="calibre10">“My thanks, Rolf,” said Frieda, looking up to me.  “The authorities’ve kept the viscount’s villainy in their sights for a long while now, but this devil’s kept his tail tucked away a bit too well, y’see.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And I trust you’ve enough to have him stand before a tribunal?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Plenty.  Our testimonial will be grounds enough for a good scouring of that mad manor.  And the torture chamber&mdash;well, our viscount here’ll sooner don the monk’s frock ‘fore that place sprouts wings to fly away with.  It’ll clinch our case quite nicely, I reckon,” Frieda smiled.  “Our princely paraphiles are tied up tight.  They won’t be going anywhere.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I see…”  My thoughts turned to the torture chamber.  “The skulls.  Give them a proper burial for me, will you?”</p><p class="calibre10">“You have my word.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And my name and face are to stay secret&mdash;I’ve your word on that as well?” I carefully requested.  “‘A bystander in a helpful mood, gone after the escape’.  That’s my meagre part in this play.  It’s hardly a lie, at least.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Scandals of the aristocracy are as tangled skeins; I’ll not blame you for wanting to keep clear of the mess.  But do you truly mean to part with not a merit to your name?”</p><p class="calibre10">“I do,” nodded I.  “Consider them all yours.”</p><p class="calibre10">As they should be.</p><p class="calibre10">My actions heretofore were to be as divorced from Emilie’s involvement and knowledge as much as possible.  Even were House Albeck to be found full-guilty of its transgressions, if it came to light that I had a hand in the matter, all but ill awaited Emilie.</p><p class="calibre10">Indeed, it would all be seen as an underhanded inquiry by the young mareschal to force an annulment of her own betrothal.  And who was it that did the snooping?  Why, no less than a member of the 5th, her very own Order.</p><p class="calibre10">‘’Twas but a bit of scrutiny upon my husband-to-be.’  None amongst the aristocracy would dare brook such an excuse.  Penned at the end of such a scenario would most certainly be the humble name of House Mernesse, forever tarnished, and Emilie’s many toils in keeping her family afloat&mdash;all as whispers set to the four winds.</p><p class="calibre10">I could not allow such to come to pass.</p><p class="calibre10">“Right then,” Frieda nodded back.  “But don’t you forget: we owe you much for your deeds on this day, Rolf.  Thank you.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And I, you.”  Our hands met and shook.  I knew then what it was like to have a friend-in-arms.  Gladly so.  “Back to town with you, is it?  To rendezvous with your employers?”</p><p class="calibre10">“That’s the plan.  ‘Twon’t do to keep these girls cut up for so long, anyway.  I’ll have them seen to.”</p><p class="calibre10">“You’re no less cut up either, Frieda.”</p><p class="calibre10">A gentle chuckle.  “I suppose not.”</p><p class="calibre10">“I must return before the morrow’s light.  We part here,” I announced.  “Apologies.  I would escort you all to town, but the luxury’s lost, I’m afraid.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Pay it no mind.  The sun is set; our pursuers’ll be blind to our whereabouts,” Frieda smiled again.  “We’ll be all right from here on out.”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“…oah… mmrgh…”</i> came a slobbering murmur.  “…Wha… where… where is this…?”  Verily had we beaten the nobles unconscious, but it would seem the viscount was spared of a fist too few, for his wits now returned to him.  “…F-fiends!  W-what is the meaning of this!?” he squirmed.</p><p class="calibre10">“Look and know, <i class="calibre3">fiend,”</i> Frieda fired back.  “You, your boy, House Albeck&mdash;your ends are nigh.”</p><p class="calibre10">“Q-quit your mummery!  Y-you are all but sheep bleating for the milk of my poppy!  And you would <i class="calibre3">for shame</i> bare your teeth at me!?”</p><p class="calibre10">“You sooner seem the bleating sheep than I, shameful master.”</p><p class="calibre10">“S-silence!  Silence, you!  You dare speak of shame!? <i class="calibre3">Hoh!</i> Shame!  ‘Tis but a base shadow before the brilliance of House Albeck!  We are foremost amongst the nobility, we are!  Our lands are holy!  None other than the St. Rakliammelech himself sojourned within these vales!” the viscount vaunted.  “I was made steward of this land by His Majesty’s grace&mdash;I’ll not be brought low by the likes of you motley rabble!”</p><p class="calibre10">To this, Frieda offered little more than a smirk.  “High words!  From a worm.”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Aaach!”</i> the lord redly fumed.  His eyes were crazed.  They searched about in twitches, settling upon Ina and Carola.  To them rushed his railing spit.  “You there!  Wasteful wenches both!  Free me at once, will you!?”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Aah…!”</i> they shrank back.</p><p class="calibre10">“Stay your whimpering!  Hie now!  Have me unbound!  Why, I’ll have you all cut up and served, I will!  For that’s all you’re good for!!”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ah…!</i> N-no… <i class="calibre3">aa… aah!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">“That’s enough from you.”  A nerve of mine was finally struck.  I came up to the viscount and summarily had his mouth muffled with whatever was at hand.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“…mmmgh…!  Mmrgh…!”</i> his indignance erupted further.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Aaaaah!  Aah!</i> No…!  No!!”</p><p class="calibre10">“P… please… mercy upon us… please…! <i class="calibre3">Ah… aaah!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Yet to Ina and Carola, their oppressor’s silence proved to be of little succour, for the nightmares that howled up from their hearts hounded them beyond all bearing.</p><p class="calibre10">“My loves, you are safe!” came Frieda, taking them into her arms. “The pain is ended&mdash;you are freed!  All is well now!”</p><p class="calibre10">But despite her sincerest efforts, the poor souls could not be calmed.</p><p class="calibre10">“Ina, Carola both.  Look to me,” I said, gentle yet firm.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Aa!  Aaah…!”</i></p><p class="calibre10">“Look,” I repeated, with as much heart as I could muster.  “I beg of you.”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ah… aah…”</i></p><p class="calibre10">A fragile moment of stillness.  This was my only chance.</p><p class="calibre10">“You’ve all been affrighted and aggrieved too much, far beyond my knowing.  I cannot even begin to share nor salve your pain, and that tears away at me to no end.”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“…Ah… au…”</i></p><p class="calibre10">“I’m sorry to say, but the wounds you bear&mdash;they would sooner heal many times over before you’re freed from the nightmares.  Till then, you must brave the many sleepless nights that await you.”</p><p class="calibre10">A frightening realisation, to know that the hurt shall not end today.  The weight of it left the two quieted.</p><p class="calibre10">“But, you have each other, and together you may remember this day of all days; this, I hope.  The day you stood up.  The day you fought your fears.  The day you saved Frieda from Kenneth’s feint.”</p><p class="calibre10">Their brows unfurrowed, as if the adventure was relived in their minds.</p><p class="calibre10">“Were it not for your courage, would we not be lost in this moment?”</p><p class="calibre10">I knew well the answer.  As did Ina and Carola, perhaps, whose quiverings lessened at last.</p><p class="calibre10">“There is strength in you both.  A solace to grace you against the demons set upon your hearts.  Of that, I am certain.”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“…a… ah…”</i></p><p class="calibre10">“Fear is a mighty foe.  But you can <i class="calibre3">fight.</i> This very moment attests to it.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…S… Ser Rolf…”</p><p class="calibre10">“I… I…”</p><p class="calibre10">A spark returned to their eyes.  I knew gladness then.</p><p class="calibre10">“You’ve shown me valour worthy of a storied knight.  To have met you all is a treasure I’ll forever cherish.  Thank you.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…N… no… I…  Tha…”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Hic…</i> Ser Rolf…  Ser Rolf…!”</p><p class="calibre10">Through the benighted valley, their cries echoed.</p><p class="calibre10">As they did through my heart, for I then found myself wishing upon every star I could see for but one simple hope: that the victims here would find peace in their days henceforth.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">─────────　♰　─────────</p>

<p class="calibre10">“Well, we’d best be off ourselves,” said our mercenary.</p><p class="calibre10">“Right,” I nodded whilst readying one of the horses.  “…Frieda.  Will you be well?”</p><p class="calibre10">“A lifetime’s worth of whippings, I’ve survived.  But I think I’ll manage.  Fear’s a foe to be fought, isn’t it?” she grinned.</p><p class="calibre10">“It is, indeed,” I chuckled.</p><p class="calibre10">“By the way…”</p><p class="calibre10">“What is it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“The hour wends to dusk, and we’re well in the wilds…” Frieda broached rather roundaboutly.  “Butt-bare have I been to every eye since our escapade began; I don’t suppose you’d keep me waiting for something to wear?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ah&mdash;” came the lightning realisation.  “R-right.”</p><p class="calibre10">Now that she mentioned it, Frieda had indeed been wholly unclothed from the time I first saw her in the gaol cell.  Somehow, the thought hadn’t occurred to me to accord her the same comfort of clothing as Ina’s and Carola’s.</p><p class="calibre10">“I took you for the sort that cares little of it.  It was shallow of me.”</p><p class="calibre10">“And to me, a shock!” she prodded.</p><p class="calibre10">I scratched my head.  “M-my apologies.  Er…”</p><p class="calibre10">After a glance down upon myself, I doffed my breastplate and gambeson, and then struggled my way out of my shirt.  Free of the fabric, I handed it to Frieda.</p><p class="calibre10">She blinked.  “What?  I’m to dress in front of you, now?”</p><p class="calibre10">“S-sorry.”</p><p class="calibre10">Hurriedly, I wound about behind her and hung the shirt over her shoulders.</p><p class="calibre10">“…’Tis more a cloak than a shirt, this,” she observed, “but it well-covers a smaller body, doesn’t it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Th-that it does.”</p><p class="calibre10">Frieda turned to me, cheeks red with mirth and a gentle beam upon her lips.  As she held the shirt tight to her bosom, Ina and Carola watched on with smiling giggles.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">‘Fare you well.  Let us hope we meet again someday.’</p><p class="calibre10">My last words to the three before I drove off upon my steed.  The path before me wound now to a new destination: my return to the 5th’s headquarters.</p><p class="calibre10">“The deed is done…” I said to myself, before turning my next words to the full-bright moon.  “…May you all find solace in your slumber.”</p><p class="calibre10">A lone prayer for the vainly sacrificed, who so suffered in the dark face of torture.  But the hands that dealt the depravity were at last caught and cuffed: this day witnessed the end to the tragedies of House Albeck’s making, at long last.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">♰</p><p class="calibre10">War-like was the tumult, just now ceased.</p><p class="calibre10">The dust finally began to settle.</p><p class="calibre10">Trimmed and proper were the training grounds of the 1st Chivalric Order, but in this moment, it seemed more a scene of massacre, for strewn about it were bodies, either bent or prostrate.  They numbered no fewer than a score, yet they were hardly corpses, though one would be forgiven for mistaking them so.</p><p class="calibre10">Proud knights of the 1st they were, only, they had not the spark of pride in them, defeated of body and spirit as they were.  But that was most expected, for standing squarely amidst their moans of pain was their mareschal.</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Ha… ha…”</i></p><p class="calibre10">Estelle Tiselius, commander to these esteemed fighters.  Hers was a face most fair, now scintillating with sweat, and her shoulders gently rose and fell as breaths breezed from her lips, unhurried, unharried.</p><p class="calibre10">It was all but a training session.  She had done her duty in hosting the rigorous practice, but it was as much for their benefit as it was for her own.  Indeed, Estelle was wont to join in their regular rigours, in each session purposefully pitting herself&mdash;and only herself&mdash;against the knightly droves.</p><p class="calibre10">That’s not to say they were easy fodder, no.  Each was the crème de la crème of the kingdom’s finest fighters, yet it was the unspotted truth that at the end of these training sessions, this would be the sorry scene presented: knights of high gallantry, beaten and bruised, but amongst them, Estelle, standing tall with nary a spot upon her body struck by any blow.</p><p class="calibre10">“Let us break for the day,” she announced with an even voice.  “Officers all, pray take ample rest.”</p><p class="calibre10">“A-aye, Mareschal,” they all made sure to answer, however brokenly.  Thus did they lend shoulders to each other on their way out.  Many amongst them would find tonight to be a sleepless night, for pangs of pain and humiliation were sure to harry them well till dawn.</p><p class="calibre10">Against the flow of the departing officers came a man: Francis Behrmann, their superior, and Under-Mareschal to the 1st.</p><p class="calibre10">“Why, mademoiselle,” the old knight began.  “‘Twould be a great ease to our officers were you to abate your hand, if even a little.  With such wantonness do you sunder their spirits.  ‘Tis certain!”</p><p class="calibre10">“Ease?”  To him, Estelle looked.  “Say now, dear Francis.  A fair while since we’ve last measured swords, yes?  Why not give <i class="calibre3">ease</i> to our officers and spar me in their stead?”</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">“Hoh!”</i> Francis wagged his hand in protest.  “Perish the thought, my Lady!  These bones are sore brittle for such excitement, you should know!”</p><p class="calibre10">“And you should know you’re hardly of the age for brittle bones,” Estelle quipped whilst wicking away the sweat from her face with a flannel.  A faint smile bent her lips, one warm with honesty, but rare to the sight of any other soul besides Francis.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet to contrast it, the old knight’s face furrowed troublingly.</p><p class="calibre10">“And I say, mademoiselle, a lady of <i class="calibre3">your age</i> should know well to yearn for another by more tranquil means.  Wistfully gazing out the window, or reciting sonnets, let’s say,” he argued from out of the blue.  “Yet here you are.  You sooner think to brandish a blade than you would a bouquet&mdash;indeed, you long for your man in the queerest of ways.”</p><p class="calibre10">“The tongue in your cheeks is cheeky overmuch, Francis!” Estelle shot back, before turning away.  “I’m not yearning.”</p><p class="calibre10">The mareschal of the exalted 1st&mdash;taken by a fleeting bout of flustering.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet the under-mareschal could only shake his head.  After all, it was his earnest wish for none of the 1st’s dear officers to be so caught up in the maelstrom of asperity that was Estelle’s special training.</p><p class="calibre10">For her part, the hero-dame was loath to entertain the slightest compromise.  In fact, she gave herself wholly to this pursuit of perfection.  Thus was it inevitable that for every training session of which she was party, her knights would be left struck and sapped of all strength to even stand.</p><p class="calibre10">But it was not always this way.</p><p class="calibre10">No.  This immuring impulse of hers was conceived at the climax of the Battle of Erbelde not more than three years past.</p><p class="calibre10">There, she witnessed it.</p><p class="calibre10">That swing of a sword, too beautiful to behold.</p><p class="calibre10">That brilliance of a battle, too sublime to shut away.</p><p class="calibre10">A vivid vision that from time to time would rewind itself in the recesses of her heart.</p><p class="calibre10">And each time that it did, she would throw herself into the throes of arduous training.</p><p class="calibre10">But each time that she did, she would know despair, for there were none here that could match her blade.</p><p class="calibre10">Estelle was not a woman to so easily forget her gratitude for her yeomen.  They were all of them knights most exemplary and true.  A sincere evaluation, one she made certain they were wise to.  Even against those of the other Orders, her soldiers shone no less brightly in their bountiful excellence.  They were each talented in their technique, tempered in their temperament&mdash;proud paragons in their own right.</p><p class="calibre10">Yet they were not enough.</p><p class="calibre10">And neither was she.</p><p class="calibre10">No matter how much she moiled in polishing both mind and body, that very thought would always well up from the depths of her heart.  And in pondering those shared inadequacies, her thoughts would turn… to <i class="calibre3">him.</i></p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">Would that he were here with me.</i></p><p class="calibre10"><i class="calibre3">Then mine unease might know a moment of solace.</i></p><p class="calibre5">&nbsp;</p><p class="calibre10">Warm air rolled from her lips.</p><p class="calibre10">“‘Tis unsightly to sigh so openly, my Lady,” Francis poked again, seeing this.  “Lest you mean to sigh away your youth.”</p><p class="calibre10">“That’s ‘happiness’ that one sighs away, Francis,” Estelle pouted.  “So wont you are to warp our dear adages for your own merriment…”</p><p class="calibre10">For one as fair as the hero-dame of Londosius, even her wistful sigh was worthy of a portrait.  Yet her truest desires were nowhere to be found in the illustrious title or any such panderings to heroism.</p><p class="calibre10">“Well?” Estelle said anew.  “You’ve read the report, I take it?”</p><p class="calibre10">“Indeed, my Lady.  A most riveting read, it was!” Francis nodded, stroking his chin.</p><p class="calibre10">What they spoke of was none other than a fateful operation of two winters past: the recapture of the Godrika Minery, completed via the sore sacrifices of the 5th.  The report was penned by the 5th’s hands themselves, sent up to Central for review.</p><p class="calibre10">Estelle had merely meant to have a look of her own upon the vaunted vicissitude, one that had sharpened anew Londosius’ dulling sword of war.  The proliferation of silver, the expansion of the frontlines, the quickening of bloodshed&mdash;all was owed to this operation.</p><p class="calibre10">But the report…</p><p class="calibre10">Therein was writ the record of a battle that betrayed the imagination.</p><p class="calibre10">A catoblepas, a creature most foul, was discovered within the tunnels.  What should have necessitated the collective struggle of whole brigades was achieved by but a single soul.  Yet to that officer the merit was denied, for Central saw fit to turn the eyes of honour elsewhere.</p><p class="calibre10">The matter demanded much thought.  Thus was Francis bade to make use of some back-channel connections, that more light may be shed upon it.</p><p class="calibre10">And there it was found that <i class="calibre3">he</i> was in opposition to the operation right from the outset.  What’s more, <i class="calibre3">he</i> had openly expounded on the dangers of acting upon the recapture.  That such an ambitious battle would sow the seeds of today’s fell fruits of war was likely what <i class="calibre3">his</i> keen ken had prevised.</p><p class="calibre10">And yet, against the counsel of <i class="calibre3">his</i> own heart did <i class="calibre3">he</i> step onto that battlefield.  There alone, with all the desperation and determination that <i class="calibre3">he</i> could muster, did <i class="calibre3">he</i> bring an end to that bloodshed…</p><p class="calibre10">…to the recognition of none.</p><p class="calibre10">What foul irony.</p><p class="calibre10">Once again, from Estelle’s lips blew a pensive sough.</p><p class="calibre10">Certainly, <i class="calibre3">he</i> would be one to get caught up in such unrequited recklessness.  Perhaps even now may <i class="calibre3">he</i> be found fighting another profitless battle.</p><p class="calibre10">The title of “hero” certainly sorted more squarely with that unseen and unsung soul.  This, Estelle knew.  This, her heart spoke.</p><p class="calibre10">“My my, dear mademoiselle,” Francis broke the silence.  “Taken to sighing for a pastime, have you?  ‘Tis a hobby for ladies more verdant, I’ll have you know.  Say, of the maidenly sort.”</p><p class="calibre10">“…I am <i class="calibre3">yet</i> a maiden.”</p><p class="calibre10">A pouting reply.  And an unreasonable one, perhaps, yet Estelle aired it anyway.  Then, half-mocking herself with a wistful smile, she shook her head and parted the training ground.</p><p class="calibre10">Even now, she dearly wished to bring <i class="calibre3">him</i> under her wing here at the 1st.  That such a fancy would never take flight was a future Estelle could never have presaged.</p><p class="calibre10">For not even the hero-dame herself can see all ends.</p>
