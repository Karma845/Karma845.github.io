<h1 style= "text-align:center;">────　Ⅴ　────</h1>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Fire magicks flashed and flew in searing arcs.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Far afield at the verge of my vision broke the barks, the bellows, the drum and boom of battle. Affrighting the air were flares of flame and fumes as our ranks of wiċċan wove volley after volley of the Lancea Calōris spell. Their target: the single gate of Arbel’s concentration camp.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">One concerted cast brought the burning lances bearing down all at once upon the barrier. Brightly billowed the ensuing explosion, spilling splinters of timber and hot bars of iron every which way. The gate was breached at last. Our way was opened.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At high noon had we initiated the attack, our opening move it was to unmake the gate. As it hardly compared to the portcullises of palaces and castles, felling it proved an unfraught affair. With it now gone, all so far was falling into place, but our course should grow only graver from here on, for the passage newly opened was woefully narrow—too narrow, in fact, to have the whole of our forces flood through. Grievous, given our primary advantage laid in our superior numbers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But we’d not the luxury of choice. This was the only way in whereupon could be fielded any number worth fearing. And within the camp festered the Fiefguard, our very mark, and so long as they did, Arbel would not be brought to its knees.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Laying siege, too, was a lost cause. The hour-sand flowed against us; the Fiefguard had to fall at the soonest, lest we find ourselves besieged in turn by Central’s reinforcements, certain to come in days’ time.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">On and on, I watched the battle from afar, and in pondering our foes did I next contemplate their new commanders as elucidated by Sigmund: the vaunted Viola Östberg, and her brother Theodor besides. The margrave was dead; not without hewing their two Östberg heads would the Fiefguard concede defeat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The terrible twin spears of Zaharte—our foes, fierce as they were famed. As I thought ahead on confronting them, Volker’s command clapped across the air like thunder. Our braves obeyed, straightway cascading into the camp. In attempting to dam the flow, the Fiefguard met them at the smouldering ruins of the gate. A new fray frothed forth. And spotted within the swelling scene: ranks of sellswords, bold and brutish—most certainly the fliers of the Zaharte flag.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The sellswords are not fled… why?” wondered Lise beside me. “What’s their dear wager in this war of ours?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A forgiven doubt. Neither creed nor coin should yet shackle the Östbergs to this battle—nay, to this very <i>land.</i> Their lord client was cut down. None would fault them were they to quit the cause. Yet here they remained, their men swinging and stabbing alongside the Fiefguard.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Was it obligation? The transfer of command, coloured anew as some oath made with the margrave in his final moments? A hard thought; they were the heads of Zaharte, preeminent professionals in their field. Never would they suffer sentimentality nor the severed purse of their recompense.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Then perhaps their hands were forced? Some unseen factor, demanding their mettle be brought to bear in this begrudging battle? …Or perhaps they were even compromised, this duo? That bending the knee to Londosius’ will served their sole recourse out of some secret scandal?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nay… the reverse seemed as like as not: the siblings, bending over backwards to curry favour from the Crown. The margrave had passed without a proper heir. Reasonable, then, that the Östbergs would crave his cold seat. After all, House Östberg was landless, last I heard—the two should hardly be above snatching Ström for their own.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A wager worth dying for, is my guess,” I said to Lise. “A dream. An <i>ambition.</i> Likely the Östbergs’ve kept the margrave’s death under wraps for their own selfish ends.” Seeing Lise deeper in thought, I turned to her with a proposition. “Suppose we sowed this truth in Fiefguard ears, Lise. What might we reap?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">She shook her head. “Too little, I think. Mere words be our mightiest proof, sooner to sprout as lies in their ears, by this time.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lise’s right; familiar as I was with the Fiefguard, I could only agree.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The margrave’s death should well-serve a tailwind for our momentum, for none else beyond the walls of Redelberne should dare muster men against us by rightful claim to Ström’s rule. But such considered only what would follow our triumph, one we must hew from the foes now afore us.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I clenched my fists in silence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Triumph—over Viola and Theodor? Had we the mettle for it? Had <i>I?</i> Sigmund and Ulrik proved enough of a pain; could I lay low their <i>superiors,</i> were we to meet?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Almost shuddering at the thought, I glared on at the battle burgeoning about the broken gate. And after a deep breath:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Our turn now,” I declared.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lise looked to me and nodded back, stern yet spirited in mien. “Fair winds find you, Rolf. May they find you all!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Also in her eyes: the five braves gathered behind me. Tasked to our team of six was the securement and extraction of the captives from the bastille. To my comrades I turned, finding their faces tense, yet nodding resolutely at Lise’s words. I then raised my voice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ready yourselves, all! We move!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so pounded our feet upon the earth as we sped off into the fray.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At our arrival, the mêlée at the gate had grown to a maelstrom, chaotic and combative. Dismounting our steeds, we dashed into the din, our ears shuddering from the shrieks and shouts of friend and foe alike.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Passing into a pall of palpable heat, our bodies at once broke into sweat. Flecks and flaps of dirt and dust danced every which way, coating skin and garb in grit and grime. In all directions swished and stung the unceasing sounds of brandished blades. In every second rang and rasped reams of armour as they clashed and clattered against one another. Right afore me: a splash of enemy spears. Right beside me: a surge of allied swords. Both sides, all bunched together in a great crush of cheek-by-jowl combat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Fallen upon the ground was one Fiefguardsman, the sight of him summarily concealed by a stampede of vying soldiers. And then upon the ears: the sounds of smashed bones and trampled entrails. But muffling them: myriad bellows, blistering and boiling ever more rabidly, filling the air to a vociferous overflow.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The battlefield, hurling in a hellish helter-skelter. Allies and adversaries, together enmeshed in an impenetrable mire.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This was a complete and utter chaos, cut and dried. But also a chaos crafted precisely to plan.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Charge the enemy, irrupt rapidly into their ranks, allow the battlefield to fall into a free-for-all, even should it exact injury from our number. Such was our aim, and for one crucial purpose: the suppression of enemy missiles, magicked or no. Going by the absence of projectiles, the plan had found success. Not that our foe could be blamed. With their numbers so dear and dwindled, the Fiefguard artillerymen could scarce disregard the risk of friendly fire.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Of note was the silencing of wide-blasting spells. From parapets and behind bulwarks could the enemy have blown holes in our ranks with impunity. Such was our greatest fear, and so to have it stricken from the equation was an immense weight off our shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Experience pays…” I muttered to myself as I led my team through the thick of battle. Indeed, the struggles of commanding the battlements of Balasthea were bearing much fruit here. So much so that I almost pitied the Fiefguard. To witness the fall of the walls of my charge was a former fear to me, one now full-lived by my present foes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Wooo—h!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So roared the Nafílim ranks all around as I rived a Fiefguardsman afore me. But not a second to spare; onward we wended through the war-like press, all whilst our fellow braves pushed the battlefront forth, gaining ground pace by precious pace.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ach…! Hold the bloody line, damn it!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Out from the screaming misery of Men, a bark from a Fiefguard field commander. A high shout followed, as though in answer:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“There ‘e is! The Man amongst ‘em! Kill ‘im! Kill ‘i—m!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A Fiefguardsman, spewing froth from his lips and pointing a finger straight at the sole Man amongst the Nafílim files—a moment, and next converged unto me a crush of Fiefguard grunts. In each of their eyes burnt reflections of the renegade they so reviled.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But all the better. Drawing their ire should well-ease my allies’ burdens at the battlefront.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Soul set, I sent forth a wide swing of wolfsteel. <i>“Dyaah!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ghwohakh!?”</i> so fell a swathe of enemy soldiers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet ill-abated were their fellows’ wrath for this rebel; in fact, their collective rancour only seemed to seethe all the more hotly. Opposite was I, keeping cool as best I could as I brandished the blackblade. Such was demanded by the white waters of war; only composure could carry me through this chaos. And so bearing myself against the brunt of brutes, I continued cutting them down one-by-one.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Amidst the failing front of Fiefguardsmen stood a soldier, staring me down with eyes so bitterly bloodshot that at any moment could they have burst with tears of red.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Eyygh…!”</i> he hissed, hate-filled and hag-like. “Foul <i>sicarius,</i> you…!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…”Sicarius.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The high epithet of a perfidist, and yet another alias for my collection. Safe to say, historically hot must be Man’s hate for this wayward son of his. Yet never one to so flagrantly fan another’s fury, I felt then another pang of pity. With such creativity do they address me; would that I had the leisure or even half a care to return the favour.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All told, I took little offence to “sicarius”. Only a soul with resolve enough to reject the machinations of this world could earn such a baleful brand. Why, I ought consider it a gift, really.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Shog off, men!” cried a voice. “This one’s mine!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And there, keen to cut down that Sicarius was yet another blade, held in the hands of a Zaharte hellion.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　∵　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Fiefguard eyes flickered with expectation. Swivelling to the voice’s source, there the Men found the Zaharte challenger strutting through their parting press, his simper steeped in pride.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Air an’ eyes, dim as dusk—the ‘ulkin’ berk ‘imself!” he shouted above the boil of battle, before raising a swordpoint in my direction. “Rolf, the turn-ed <i>wolf!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To him I gave a narrowed gaze. “Who speaks?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You ungraced gudgeon, you!!” he shouted on disregardfully. “That there grubby fingers stain the fine art o’ swordplay, they does!! Time to school you in <i>real</i> slicery!” Quite the self-absorbed simian, this man—or a scullion soused from endless ale. Then, without ceremony: <i>“Ssrryahh!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A shriek, and off he shot straight my way, his sword swung from on high. I met him with one of my own, batting sharp silver away with black steel.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>─Ghheen! Khaeen!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">One, two more exchanges, each stinging our ears. Practice guided his swings. Power girded his sword. An adept of the blade he was, much more so than the Fiefguard rabble gathered about us—Zaharte’s fame truly feigned no fluke. On and on he thrashed as I guarded in turn, backing gradually away whilst measuring his mettle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hyoh! Hyah!”</i> he huffed along with every hew. “Better start bitin’ back, shag! ‘Fore I nip that there neck o’ yers right clean!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No doubt, then: this dastard really was inebriated, but from bottles of a different brew—the cider of supremacy, the rotgut of renown as the ungraced’s slayer-to-be. Next did we each venture a spirited swing, and as our blades bit and locked:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Rolf! Our swords are yours!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There: a cry from my comrades as they rallied to me, arms ready.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With a heave, I pushed away my opponent. “Nay, keep them! They’ll serve you better soon enough!” I answered. Though their succour was full-appreciated, more pressing was the mission at hand. The bastille loomed a long way off yet, and here we were, hemmed in still from all sides, having hastened deep into hostile ground. Any mind taken from self-protection was a peril beyond the price of this silly duel.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“As you will,” one of my braves conceded. “But your back is ours to guard!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then you have it,” I nodded. “My thanks.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Off the five then flew to fend off the mobs of Fiefguardsmen, leaving me to dance with the Zaharte hellion unharried. Volker had chosen well: these braves were both capable and unclouded in scrying the course of this chaos. Comforted, I refocused upon my opponent, finding him snickering at the situation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hyeheh! Warm chums with the witch-churls, ain’t ya? Eh, ungraced!?” he remarked, sword readied again.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Were I to fell him here now, the rest of the rabble should follow—a pinhole to sink the ship, as it were. Mulling the thought, I readied my own weapon, triggering a charge from my foe.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Yeeaaagh!”</i> he shrieked, letting fly his sword in flailing slashes. The crescendo of clashing metals continued along with my vigilant defence. As he pushed forth, so did I pace back, a detail not lost to the Fiefguard lookers-on:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Lo! The Zaharte master’s got the higher hand, he does!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yea, that’s it! Chop ‘im t’chunks, ser! Ehyeheh!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Their jeering cheers seemed a wind in my foe’s sails, for as his ears drank their words, his eyes glimmered anew with battle-glee, his blade biting and barking with greater brutality. Dashing his weapon away with a sweep of the soot-steel, I shifted to the high guard for a reprisal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>─Ghosshr! Ghakh!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A one-two blast of banging blades—my twice-swung offence, foiled by my foe just in the nick of time. And it showed: sweat shone on his brows, his breaths heaved heavily. Though going by his up-curled smirk, that inflated pride of his remained unpunctured.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘E’s got th’book full-read, mates! It be over now!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“They’re somethin’ else, innit? These Zaharte blokes!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">More applause from the Fiefguard grunts, each word further stoking my opponent’s spirits. Clear on his flustered face was a delight dancing more boldly than before.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Heheh…” he smirked again. “&#8230;Well? Ready fer the checkmate, lad?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Leisurely, he lifted his sword to the centre guard as a fisher looses his line into the depths. I bit the bait, bolting in just as he’d hoped. Grinning still, my foe slipped into a defensive stance, full-intent on a deft deflection and a deathblow following.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But this prey had humoured the predator for long enough.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Into the ground: a thunder-stamp of my foot, accelerating my charge to a speed beyond the sellsword’s answering. Wolfsteel then howled forth—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—shhdofh!—</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—and hewed open my mark’s bosom, bone and breastplate both.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Eah…?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Hitherto had I feigned feeble-swordedness to this foe of mine, showing him swings and thrusts a mite milder than what his mettle could handle—a ploy oft played upon opponents of inferior skill not unlike he. Cast aside the cloak and reveal my full vehemence, however, and no longer could he keep up. Indeed, never did he seem a risk worth much regard, but this was a battlefield: <i>all</i> risks must be minded. For him, I merely obliged.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“W-wha…? <i>O-ohhkh…”</i> he gasped, utterly perplexed till his expiration. As his limp body spilt unto the dust, the surrounding Fiefguardsmen collectively recoiled.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There—our chance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The way’s open!” I cried, raising high the sword of soot. “Break through, break through!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ooo───oouhh!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Heeding my call, the Nafílim ranks roared and rushed forth altogether. Sighting the change from far off, Volker answered with a cry of his own.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Staffeln Two and Three! Retrieve the wounded and draw back!” thundered his timely command. “Staffel Six! Advance, advance!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Like currents cutting new courses, a great bustle was roused as braves flowed to and fro. Knowing the gate vicinity was too narrow to host our forces in full, we had ourselves split into disparate Staffeln beforehand for this battle; now as some withdrew from the fray, others joined in…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“We’ve waited for this!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…with Lise and her own braves being one of them. With lightning immediacy befitting their leader, Lise’s Staffel filled the void and broke out fighting. Forces, drawing back and joining in—such was our strategy, that we might never show our foe a faltering in our numbers, not even for a moment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Haa—ah!” cried Lise, gusting through like a whirlwind, her two longdaggers dancing and dicing through Fiefguard flesh. Hers was a flair for the offensive flurry, of swings and scythings carried out with fleet frequency—a performance proving frighteningly effective in such close-quarters chaos as we were.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Uaagh!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The screams of Men resounded as bit by bit their number yielded dear ground. Discerning their new despair, I turned with fresh orders for my five braves.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ready up! This is it!” I cried. “We push through! All the way to the bastille!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Aye!” they returned in unison, and at once we charged straight into the enemy ranks. Lise’s longdaggers continued their lethal lashings, eating away at the Fiefguard line like a gouging gale.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Tyah!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Sseh!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My braves lacked naught in their own prowess. Their blades maimed and mowed down the unnerved Men, forcing forth the frontline like a steady and unstoppable tide.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“There, the left wing! Cut through! Now, now!!” so vaulted Volker’s orders. Indeed, the Fiefguard’s left flank was greatly thinned, having been eviscerated by Lise’s blades. Spying the opportunity, our forces washed in at once, but not before letting loose a mighty roar.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ooouuhh!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Another moment, and like a dam bursting open, the Fiefguard ranks gave against the weight of our offensive. The pinhole was now a gaping split, into which our number began to pour—a river, bristling with blades and bellowing voices; a torrent teasing out of the Men many a scream.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Oaaggh!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Fall back! Fall back an’ regroup!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Resistance was impossible against such a stampede; ill-able to maintain their line, the Fiefguardsmen broke ranks and scattered back. At last: the gate area was fully wrested. The way unbarred, our army of braves began storming the camp, where awaited new numbers of Fiefguard and Zaharte fighters alike. Horns blared to have them readied, but to our ears, it sooner sounded a heralding of the imminent end of this margravate of Ström.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　∵　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">A year after their departure, I’d followed in Emilie’s and Brother’s footsteps to the 5th.  I remember well what I’d felt then: promise, anticipation… all made pale before my many dour doubts.  And for why but dreading what drudgery and injustice Brother might had been brooking.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas a dark day, then, when that all unfurled afore my very eyes.  Slight and contempt, scorn and sport—these all were at once his sole companions, and at another, scars carven full into his flesh with every farcical spar.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But what’d bewildered me most was the bond between Brother and Emilie—that is, what it had become.  A pair once so picturesque, now fraught and fractured, bound by what seemed more as bondage than a loving bond.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Emilie: an immediately accoladed dame.  Brother: her subservient swain.  A mistress and her minion.  A relationship misshapen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet it remained a matter without remedy.  No, not by Emilie’s power could it’ve been mended, nor by her prestige… nor even by her many protests.  Such was our society, our world.  I’d desired deeply for Brother to do his part, at the very least.  To soothe her sorrows, to solve his situation by any means available.  But he’d instead kept silent and endured the disdain, devoting himself full-stolid to his martial disciplines—a cowed escape, a meaningless pursuit, no matter how I measured it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Less and less I knew his heart.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The heart of my own brother.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The heart of whom I so cherished.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet soon were my concerns constricted to my own burdens.  The abrupt expectation of my parents, the bearing of House Buckmann’s future…  Such unwieldy weights, alleviated only by chivalric merit, by achievement… by results.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nonetheless, passing under the Order’s portcullis for the very first time, I’d steeled myself against one certainty: a harried, handicapped start.  Sister to an ungraced, bloodkin to a black sheep—no doubt such a soul would stoke stares most unsavoury.  All the jeers and japery reserved for my brother, soon to be mine to share.  And though share I did, so, too, was I pitied.  More so than I deserved, perhaps.  Thus did I climb the knightly ladder rather unladed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Yoná has bestowed Her blessings upon you, Officer Buckmann…  Proper, unprofane blessings…  So I say, let not that man drag you down so…’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Words once offered to me by the Mareschal Tallien.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Our Deiva’s is an even hand, never wont to wield unjust retribution.  The Order itself is a bastion to such a belief, its knights fast followers of fairness.  And so I abided, going on to earn some repute amongst their number, for it happened that I’d been bequeathed a bounty of odyl.  Not to the same degree as Emilie’s, but enough to astonish my peers and superiors all the same.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><strong><i>‘&#8230;Globus Igneus…!’</i></strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A sphere of flames, kindled by my hand as instructed.  But more a wonder in the eyes of my instructor, of all those gathered to bear witness:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Praises upon Yoná…’</i> one of them had uttered then, <i>‘&#8230;a miracle stands ‘fore us…!’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Burning brilliant in the air above me: my very first conjuration of the Globus Igneus spell, but woven to a size manyfold my instructor’s example.  ‘Twas not only generous odyl that I’d been graced with—on that day was discovered my talent for sorcery itself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">One year thence found me a lieutenant, leader to my own brigade division.  A worthy promotion for House Buckmann’s next-in-line, and certainly a cause for much celebration.  But through another lens, it had only seemed yet another rift opening anew between Brother and myself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Gh… hhach…!’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Oi…!  Back on your trotters, sty-churl…!  Training’s only begun…! …Tch…!  Better a strawman than you…’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Whilst the gown of fair regard was mine to wear, the gazes of reverence mine to garner, down in the dirt was my brother, steeped in soot and soil… and shame.  A woefully often sight, and in beholding it, I’d begun to feel… something, somewhere deep in my bosom…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…icing over.  Ever so steadily.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Quite the rising star of late… aren’t you, Felicia…?’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Rising star, indeed…!  You are our pride, my dear…!  Our joy…!’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Tis not too far between the barony and headquarters.  Thus did I make certain to return home and meet Mother and Father, time permitting.  And on every occasion would their compliments rain my way.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…But only my way.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Brother’s was a name long forsaken upon their lips.  But ‘twas not to be helped.  Mother and Father could not boast of him, no…  They could not…  Not for that brother of mine.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Lady Felicia…’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My address, cold with decorum… and spoken in Brother’s own voice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It’d sat ill with me at first, but with his every utterance of it, less and less its briars began to  bite.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Neither of us, nor any at all, can dare sustain our childhood innocence forever.  Each winter’s passing brings change—to us, to our hearts…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…to the bonds between us.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">..</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Still.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still, I wish not to cast him from my sight.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still, I wish not to abandon him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such thoughts I inly intone, as though to convince myself of their sincerity.  Yet little convincing is needed: in them is nary a lie.  That, I can adamantly declare.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I do not despise my brother.  Not at all.  In my heart of hearts, I harbour no hate for him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And as with me, so ‘tis with Emilie.  Of this, too, am I most certain.</p>

<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Now.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Now could I hear again the howls of battle, the beating of war-like feet, the fanging of swords and spears.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">From afar I watched the fray as it raged where the gate once stood.  There, with desperate industry, the Fiefguard toiled to turn the tide of Nafílim, but try as they might, more and more their number bled, more and more their brethren broke, all against the brimming brunt of their foes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A humbling sight surely unlost to Viola’s eyes.  Hers was a high perch upon the watchtower, where to this moment was she dictating the defence with the field commanders.  Yet the effort seemed fraught: no sooner after the gate had been unmade that the battle began to boil to its present pitch, with friend and foe alike feverishly mired in a mad mêlée.  All advantage offered by our defences was fast fading; through Viola’s fingers was fleeting the fine sand of victory.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Though I thought her hardly at fault.  The situation was dire to begin with.  Many Fiefguard captains had been cut down in the prior battle.  Yet despite scarce time to regroup and reforge the frayed chain of command, the Fiefguard fought rather well under Viola’s watch.  But mightier still was the enemy’s momentum.  Unchanged, our situation would soon fail.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">As if to corroborate my reckoning, there next swelled a chorus from the frontline, terrible as ‘twas sudden.  The Fiefguard had foundered.  Through their ranks then flooded the Nafílim, breaking brazenly into the camp proper.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Now more than ever, the Fiefguard seemed destined for defeat.  And just as destined: the fall of Arbel, the Nafílim occupation of Ström, the loss of Londosian land—a calamity certain to appal our posterity.  And to think, that counted amongst the confederates to this historic crisis could be that brother of mine.  I had many words for him, if so, and a great many more I should like to hear from him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For that very purpose had I sued to join this battle, a request heeded only on condition that I standby in this corner of the rearguard.  Viola was most loath to let me meet my own brother, I think, and so had disallowed me from lifting even a finger to reinforce her men.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All fine and good, truth be told.  Where that brother of mine might appear, I could well-foresee.  Turning ‘round, I looked up at his probable destination: the bastille, looming grim and grey against the besmoked skies.  Why he would, whether he would—these I ill-guessed.  But if for certain he’d made fast friends with the Nafílim, then more certain again would he make haste to this very structure, and there endeavour a deliverance of the prisoners within.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I stood alone here in the open.  Gone were the few Fiefguardsmen once manning this post, having hastily headed off to their final reckoning at the fray.  But that struggle was theirs and theirs alone to assay.  Mine was to wait.  For the sharer of my blood.  For the inspirer of Viola’s trepidation:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>‘&#8230;Brigadier…</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>…That brother of yours has sore-scorned both Crown and kinsmen,<br />
choosing instead to walk the treacher’s way… for why we can never know…</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>…And in bringing to bear the full brunt of his fearsome prowess<br />
has he made culled and cornered curs of the once-proud Fiefguard…</i></p>
<p style="text-align: center"><i>…Who with right mind, then, should reckon he surrender<br />
when such a storm it is he rides against us…?’</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Fearsome prowess”.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Wielded to “make cornered curs” out of the Fiefguard.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The words of the renowned Zaharte captain herself.  And regarding whom but my own brother.  Yet in hearing them was I hardly filled with pride and joy—I had but stood, silenced by their meaning.  Just as I’d been silent these many past seasons.  Silent of trust in Brother’s strength.  Silent of praise for all his pains.  Silent, like all the others in the Order.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nay.  ‘Twas perhaps jealousy and shame that Viola had teased out of me.  A mere sellsword, neither an associate nor an acquaintance of Brother, yet speaking of him as though she’d shared more winters with him than his own sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Was it simply that somehow, somewhere deep in my heart, I yet yearned for him?  Just as I’d done during our littler years?  Was it that too hastily, too capriciously had I despaired at his present pitiableness?  At his sheen, sullen and sallowed as ‘twas to his former shine?  Such thoughts I’d felt faintly afire in me when Viola pressed for my answer there in the manor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet what recourse did I have?  Who was it that failed me?  Who was it that fell to arrant frailness?  Had my brother remained the lodestar I so adored, would we yet be whirling in woe as we were now?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Mine were not the clouded eyes here, were they?  Of course not.  My measure of him was most certainly sound.  Why, lo—there’s Brother now, hurrying hither.  To this very place, to the deliverance of the prisoners—just as prevised.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet in seeing him, trouble sooner beset me than cheer, truth be told.  Trouble for his coming.  Trouble for his presence here upon a battlefield, of all places.  ‘Twas all an error; to this moment was he elsewhere, far away on his holiday—a gladness, if so.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But nay.  Familiar was his form.  Fleet was his faring.  Onward he hurried my way, surrounded by what else but a pack of Nafílim fighters—his comrades and escorts, like as not, having just felled in his place the Fiefguardsmen barring their course.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Before long, the two of us stood aface, still and silent.  Five months in the making, my reunion with Brother—Rolf Buckmann, the exile.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A rather unremarkable length of time, thinking on it.  But one feeling more an eternity from last I’d seen of him at the hearing…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…from last we had words for one another.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Felicia…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Brother.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Never was his face a fountain of expression.  Still, in our earlier days, I’d prided myself in guessing his heart with just a single glimpse.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But now…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…no longer could I see the heart behind those eyes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">All sins must answer, all treachery put to trial.  Whether before a god, a judge… or a loved one.  For such a reckoning had I well-steeled myself.  Yet, that the day should dawn so soon…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The fates—ever fain to twist the stabbing dagger, to taunt the staggered soul.  I felt then some watchful eye raising me some concealed question, demanding my due remorse.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Nay.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Enough of the fates, of blaming the clouds… of looking away.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I’d chosen this path.  And in so doing had chosen also strife against my own blood, my own family:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Those Nafílim,” my sister flatly began, “let them away where they must.  They’ve business in the bastille, have they not?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Bafflement flashed through my braves.  Not that any blame could be theirs.  A foe, yielding the way?  At once they turned to me, racked by the riddle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Go,” I said to them.  “She looks to have business of her own—with me.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Aye,” answered a brave.  “Rolf.  Fair winds find you.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Having swiftly judged the situation, they started straightway, passing my sister with due caution before disappearing into the bastille.  Once certain of their safe passage, I returned my gaze to Felicia, finding hers long focused upon me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You’re sullied from head to heel, Brother,” she remarked.  “Soot, is it?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“No soldier goes unsullied.  Such is war,” I said back.  “But let’s cut to the quick—why are you come, Felicia?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;I was ‘the Lady Felicia’ to you, last we spoke.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You could be again, if you so wish.  That much I owe you: a politeness for my newest opponent.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;hh!”</i> Felicia half-gasped, as though stung by that last word.  Then, with a strained regard: “&#8230;I <i>was come…</i> to enquire why you refused the recruitment call, Brother.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Recruitment’?” I echoed.  “&#8230;Ah.  <i>That.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A call to Londosius’ brighter minds for the post of Chief Adjutant of the 5th Chivalric Order.  A call I myself had received, but left to collect dust upon the commandant’s desk—full-aware it was worded for me and my homecoming.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Where was your answer?” my sister pressed.  “Why were <i>you</i> not come?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Because my feet had found another path, Felicia.  A way I now walk with resolve… after renouncing all reason for return.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It’d arrived at a rather inopportune time, that call: a mere month before my quest into Nafílim country.  The rekindled promise of knighthood, weighed against a promise made with Mia…  The choice was clear.  But absent the latter, still would silence have been my answer, for though I’d shared a road with Emilie and Felicia for many winters, mine now wended far away from theirs.  Too, too far away.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;What ‘path’?” Felicia asked, troubled.  “You were <i>banished,</i> Brother.  Retribution, not resolve, was what had flung you to this fringeland—a bane to any other eye, but a <i>boon</i> to yours alone…?  Surely you cannot be so blind to your own folly?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“My eyes see no folly.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But <i>mine</i> do!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Her cry, concise, yet unclear.  Though one thing was certain: sincerely was my sister trying to pour out her long-shut heart.  An effort looking as painful as it was long overdue.  Why, she’d braved a whole journey just for the opportunity.  To not oblige her here would be remiss of me as her brother.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What is ‘resolve’ to you, then, Felicia?” I began to debate.  “Is it not the sparking of the soul afire?  The braving of the dark when all light is lost?  A self-given grace to any other soul, but a grief to yours alone?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What tears have you shed, to speak of my grief!?” she screamed back.  “Emilie offered both hand and heart to you, that you should be helped from this hole!  And yet…!  Yet you brushed away that hand!  You broke that very heart!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia, shivering with fury.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">When was it, I wonder?  When last she’d shown such ire?  Perhaps never.  In all the years of her youth, scant were her tantrums.  And even then were they but the tiniest sort, not once breaking above quiet discontent.  How it haunted me, then, to hear her fair voice moved to such misery.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Amidst that moment of reminiscence for little Felicia, I heard again that same voice, grown now, but low with languor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Tell me, Brother.  Was it truly you?  Was it by your fault that Emilie’s steed was vanished?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I’d well-made my case at the hearing,” I answered.  “Weren’t you listening?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“An entire night in town!  Yet too tipsied to remember aught!?  Who could’ve lent ear to such a farce!?” she cried again, agonised.  “A night… spent bedding with some… some <i>brothel-maiden…!?</i>  Don’t tell me <i>that</i> was the truth of it!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“An empty allegation, fed by the leaders,” I quickly cut back.  “Don’t tell me <i>you</i> swallowed their slander?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I never wanted to!  Never!  But what else was left to me!?  <i>What!?”</i> she screamed, her lungs now spent from lament.  Overlapping her again was the ghost of her greener days: my toddling sister, tiny and in tearful tantrum.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Felicia,” I said, as though to soothe her.  “Circumstance was what’d stopped the truth at my lips.  Silence and sophistry were all <i>I</i> had left.  But let me ease you, nonetheless: it was not I who let that horse loose.  And as to whether I’d produced coin for a corner-girl, well… no confessor would find the purchase worth chiding, I’d think.  But as you insist, I’ll set it straight again: no such deed was ever mine.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Her eyes then cast quietly down.  Whether from comfort or some conflict within, I could not know.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Believe me, or believe <i>them—</i>which way you walk is yours to decide,” I went on.  “Reach that resolve by your own two feet, Felicia.  I’ve walked beside you as far as any brother could—but no further.  No longer.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;What’s this so asudden?” she uttered, slowly shaking her head.  “Why play the dear brother now…?  The stage is dark… the curtains long-closed…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…That it was.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To yearn for the model brother; such is the right of any younger sister.  Her prince and paragon, her guide and aegis, meek yet mighty, firm yet fair.  Ousted from that stage though I was, I forsook the part for her protection… and in so doing left Felicia without a brother.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thus could I not be who she wanted me to be.  I could not answer my own sister’s simplest, most innocent and deserved desire.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Brother.  I know not what tricks you’ve chanced against your trials thus far… but the battlefield ill-feigns the gentle judge.  Not by deceit can you forever flee your sentence,” she warned at length, clenching tightly the silverstaff against her bosom.  “And yet you would chance another trial here?  Against <i>me?</i>  A reverie of a victory is your lightest verdict, Brother, surely you see this…!  As well as I can!  So please… come with me, Brother?  Come home… to where you ought be.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Where I ought be.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Who I ought be.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What way I ought walk.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Difficult, isn’t it, Felicia?  Yet not few are those without direction, without selfhood, without a home to call their own.  This, you ought know.  Just as you ought know that no longer do I count myself amongst them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I’ve found what I’ve long sought.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Pay your penance… quit this chaos.  Won’t you do this for me, Brother?” Felicia further pleaded.  “Emilie yearns for your return, even now!  Her sway is mighty, her wings welcoming!  Shelter under them, and not even your present sins shall—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I shook my head.  “Felicia.  I’m sorry.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Indeed, I’ll not wend away from where I’m finally welcome.  I’ll not baulk this battle of mine.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;’Sorry’&#8230; you said?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That I did.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A new hush.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Once more, Felicia’s gaze fell.  Ruby eyes, brimming with beauty—hid now behind lengths of forlorn lashes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Why?” she brokenly began again.  “Why continue this tantrum?  Why challenge the chariots of war, child as you are?  Five winters, Brother, <i>five.</i>  And still I find you stunted.  Yet you’ve gall enough to… to twirl that <i>twig</i> of yours afore fearsome titans…!  What shame…!  Please, Brother… <i>please…</i> no more.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Shame?  Never have I shuddered at any shame I’ve shown.  My days in the Order—days of being laid low, of being left beaten, bantered, and ablood—all of them I’d endured that I might crawl a mite closer to that tiny light at tunnel’s end.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But to stand aside, stayed and made an unwilling witness to her brother’s unbrookable labour—such was Felicia’s lot, her lament.  Such was my only regret.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Won’t you come with me, Brother?” she went on.  “Forget this fool fight…  Come home?  And there find employ under House Valenius; live anew with duty, strive again with dignity… and… and then—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Felicia.”  Once more, I shook my head.  “It’s not to be.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My sister, surpassing all pain in her bosom to beg my return.  A struggle as clear as it was cutting.  But I could not oblige.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I can’t go back, Felicia.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nay—I won’t.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Twas we who’d sent you here, ‘tis certain… but what choice had we!?  What more of mercy could we have accorded you!?  When so jealously did you hide from us the truth!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Brimming over with emotion, no longer could my sister confine her screams.  No longer could she dam her tears.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And <i>still</i> did we assay to send for you!  <i>Still</i> we wanted you back home!  That recruitment call—you ought’ve known full-well ‘twas for you and you alone!  How we <i>trusted</i> to your answer…!  How we <i>yearned</i> for your return…!  Emilie and I both!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;You would betray us, then?  <i>Us?</i>  Your beloved?  Your bloodkin?  Our differences, I’ll not deny, but… but are we so fraught?  That you would fain forget aught and all you’ve once cherished?  Who can find closure in such cruelty, Brother?  Who…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia’s voice was quivering.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">An answer for her, then.  From this failure of a brother to his long-forlorn sister: a raw, aching answer.  Such she deserved, at the very least.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Closure’?  ‘Cruelty’?” I broke my silence.  “Mere leisures and luxuries, Felicia.  Comforts beside the bale and brutality of <i>this reality.</i>  It <i>cuts,</i> it <i>coldens,</i> it <i>confounds</i>—all with a smile most serene, all… whilst innocents are pillaged and put to the sword.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I… I simply stand to strike it all down.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;What reality, Brother?” she beseeched.  “Strike down <i>what?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Londosius.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;hh!!”</i> she gasped again, fully now, her countenance blanched of all colour, as though receiving at last the full brunt of her brother’s betrayal.  “&#8230;You are set, then…?” she asked, almost breathless.  “You would turn against Kin and Crown?  Find fellowship with the Nafílim?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Kin of Man, kin of Nafílim—we’re souls all alike,” I returned.  “And so I say this: it is <i>because</i> I am a soul that I must stand, fight, and forge on.  For my conviction.  For my creed.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then you would strike down your own sister, as well?  Dame of Londosius that she is?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“If her fall should further peace… yes.  I would.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Hearing my answer, Felicia stood stunned and hushed.  She turned down to the ground, staring at it strengthlessly, as though all meaning and purpose had expired asudden.  A still span followed, filled only with the far din of the fray, till at last Felicia’s lips parted slowly again.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;simple chore…” so rose a whisper of hers.  “&#8230;’Tis a simple chore… to break your every limb and lug you back…  Know you not my mettle, Brother…?  How it stands a mountain over your own?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Felicia,” I answered, gripping tight the soot-steel.  “Not even unlimbed will I yield.  No deals will I cut, no quarter will I give.  Such is my dignity—and the respect you deserve, as a fellow wager of war.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You foresee my fall, Brother!?  By your blunted blade!?” she shouted, shooting her gaze at me anew.  Her ruby-rose regard—no less lovely it was, even when veiled behind so many tears.  “I’m a Dame Brigadier to the Order!!  And you!?  What’re you but Rolf Buckmann, the ungraced!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“It’s ‘Rolf’.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A blink.  “&#8230;What…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Rolf Buckmann’ is no longer,” I stated firmly.  “Only ‘Rolf’ remains.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia grimaced.  “&#8230;You would renounce our noble name?  Our house?  Then renounce it full, why not!?  Forget, too, your birth name!  Your first gift from Mother and Father!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The first of only few.  But nay—I like it enough.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A lull.  And then…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…a roar.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Enough,” Felicia uttered lowly.  “Enough of this.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Drowning out now the drone of distant battle: a deluge of odyl.  Streams over streams, swirls under swirls, bright odyl dancing like a storm, in whose eye stood an indignant Felicia.  A veritable maelstrom of magick, matching the ire and energy of its mistress’ emotions.  The air palpably pressed in from all directions.  Skin tingled, senses blared; afore my sister—this celestine child of heaven-sent sorcery—seemed to bend and bow the whole of the world itself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Stand against ‘this reality’, you said?  ‘Strike it all down’?” resounded Felicia above the bellowing odyl.  “Then let me unfurl for you another fold to this ‘reality’.  One that finds you frail, stricken of all strength to stand—<i>your</i> reality, Brother.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All at once, the storm surged and scintillated.  Felicia’s fair features glimmered, her sable-silk hair billowed, her blood-ruby eyes blazed.  Mesmerised by the sight for but an instant, I readied forth the <i>svǫrtaskan</i> at once.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This was it.  The fated fight.  The vying of each our full-unveiled resolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">“Know now your folly!  Your shame!!  And repent!!”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Dame Brigadier to the Sorcerers of the 5th Chivalric Order: Felicia Buckmann.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My sister.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px"><strong>“Tonitrus!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Up swung the silverstaff, down showered the levin-shafts; a stampede of pillars rampaging right my way.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I threw myself aside in an instant, and in the next, witnessed numberless flashes slashing through where I once stood.  Air burned white, earth smouldered black.  In my ears: the cackle of electricity.  In my nose: a stench like sweet, seared iron.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Tonitrus—one of the basic magicks, but mastered by Felicia unto a fatal monstrosity.  Its speed, its spite, all surpassed dauntingly aught a common caster could ever dare.  In that briefest of moments, whilst illumined by the lurching levin, my thoughts turned to the 5th’s Sorcery Brigade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With the war effort whipped to a fever following the recapture of Mt. Godrika, the 5th saw then a sudden influx of new personnel.  Days of late found the Sorcery Brigade burgeoned to five divisions, each helmed by lieutenants of genuine ability.  But high above them all loomed their leader: the brigadier, mightiest of the 5th’s sorcerers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That very soul was afore me now: Felicia, a lieutenant at sixteen years of age, a brigadier at seventeen.  For two years thereafter did she hold fast her position, her youth yielding not a seam in her supremacy.  Though she’d long stood in the shadow of Emilie’s heroic strength, no mistake was to be made: my sister was a prodigy without peer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All magick-apt recruits learn first the Globus Igneus spell.  Felicia was no different.  Only, she’d conjured hers to thrice the size of her senior’s example—to this very day, an episode fresh in the minds of the 5th.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A sister full-bloomed from bud to flower-field…  Perhaps I ought rejoice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Or perhaps not.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For over her skyward staff now floated a flaming sphere: fearsome and phenomenal, a veritable sun sent down to this plane…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><strong>“Globus Igneus!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…to immolate this mortal unto embers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Gwofh!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The fireball flew.  The air rippled.  A glimpse of its magma-red mantles gave away an affrighting truth: this spell’s <i>fivefold</i> size belied an odyllic density <i>manyfold more</i> tremendous.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Struck by such strength, I tumbled away in terror… only to find myself aface yet another sphere—Felicia’s twice-incanted trap was sprung.  Caught in the ensuing explosion, blows burned and blasted at every facet of my body as I was thrown through the air.  Into the dust I crashed, and laid there scorched and soiled, limp and lifeless, a sight formerly witnessed many a time upon the training grounds of the 5th.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Such was the scenario scribed in my sister’s mind.  “Felicia’s infallible offence”, she might’ve fancied it.  How utterly wide her eyes went, then, when they beheld instead not her brother in flight—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Humgh!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—but his black hewer plunging into the heat of her flames.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>Boom!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>Hiss.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>…Hush.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Hot winds coldened unto calm.  Snuffed was the summoned sun.  Felicia’s fivefold sphere of flames—twained to naught by a single, sooted sword.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What…?” she gasped, ill-tracing what’d transpired afore her eyes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The look of sound astonishment—and chance.  Seizing it, I speed through the distance between us, bearing the blackblade low.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ah—<i>ech!”</i> Felicia stammered.  Only half a second now separated us, but alas: my sister sooner snapped from her confoundment and scrambled forth another spell.  <strong>“F-Flagrāns Vallum!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Bright fences of flame unfurled right afore my face, barring my warpath.  With a stamp, I halted—<i>“Szyah!”</i>—and sheared straightway through the blaze, only to find in its extinguished wake my quarry gone from sight.  Quickly I began to scan about, but no sooner did a sound then strike my ears.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A ruse…?” began a breathless murmur.  “Is this some ruse you play?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There, from many paces away to the side stood a freshly fled Felicia, gasping and glaring at me as though haunted.  To which I readied not words, but my weapon once more.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Some sleight of the sword?” her doubting continued.  “My spells… snuffed from all sight?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“If such be what your eyes’ve seen, then best start believing them—soon,” I answered at last.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“N-no!” my sister cried.   “A bald lie!  I’ll not believe it…!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then why the fear?  The flight?” I said, ever slowly stepping closer.  “Come—meet my blade.  Your precious paling ought shield you, shouldn’t it?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“This can’t be…” she muttered again, incredulous, “&#8230;it <i>cannot…”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Never have I liked such a line.  The “impossibles”, the “this-can’t-be’s”—mere admissions to an unimaginative mind, oft spewed by the more pious of the population.  Lambs, doubting adamantly aught they deem deviant from their shepherd’s designs, sooner seeing a hill for its grasses than the wolves prowling its slopes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Naught but escapism, I say.  But that Felicia herself had fallen victim to that same vice…  As her brother, a pity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…But for her opponent, an opportunity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I bolted forth again, keen to close the distance before my mark could snap out of her stupor.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But too late:  <i>“Hht!”</i> she gulped, flourishing fast her silverstaff.  <strong>“Feriēns Flagrum!!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Shrieking now against the air: a geyser-whip of grinding waters.  By Felicia’s might, it looked ready to rend through rock and armour alike—and make mush of an ungraced, given chance.  Halting, I steadied myself and my nerves, and facing the scything surge, sent against it the sword of soot.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There: the spell’s angle of attack, aimed not at my neck, but my ankles—seeming proof that not yet had my sister mustered the resolve to reckon with her brother.  But for her, it served well enough.  Having forced her foe to pause and tame the torrential whip, once again was Felicia able to flee all danger.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Gh…”</i> she panted from afar, watching her waters unravel against my sword.  “&#8230;Brother!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At a loss for words, she puckered her sweat-beaded brows.  Fatigue seemed to have set in, but not on account of consecutive spellcasts, no.  More likely that a weariness was weighing heavily on her mind, with much thought spun to grasp this absurd situation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What… what is this?  <i>How…?”</i> she pressed with broken breaths, but again I dared not an answer, choosing instead to study the distance between us.  In so doing, I caught a clearer glimpse of her distress: the countenance of a cornered mark.  Yet reality knew a different score, for in truth, not once had I gained her enough to attempt an offence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ever am I disposed to the counterattack, but such proved small avail against a capable spellweaver.  Here, my sword was my sole weapon, the game of cat-and-mouse my sole recourse—one finding my foe free to fire upon me at pleasure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There must be a better way.  But what?  Likely would I be pinned down, and very soon.  Forced into error, nailed by a direct blow—my fast defeat, then and there.  Exhausting my mark’s stores of odyl was one idea, but worthy only against the stock sorcerer.  No, Felicia’s reserves were unfathomable; a waiting game against her would dig my early grave.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The chase it was, then.  Begrudgingly, I crept forth, scraping my soles against the gravel and glaring at the gap between us.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘What is this,’ I said!  Explain at once!!” shouted Felicia, soured by my silence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Explain what?” I returned.  “Clean up your questions, will you?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“My spells…!  Severed by your sword!  <i>How!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You’ve said it yourself, haven’t you?  I severed—<i>snuffed</i> them out of sight.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;Gh!!”</i>  Her face reddened with rage.  A sincere response from a soul most sincere since her earliest days.  Indeed, ever was my sister easily thwarted by guile and negotiation.  Of course, never have I wished her rather grown to a more cynical and scrying sibling, but to see her so handily heated by a few words well-stoked my worries.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not that worrying for her was any right of mine.  No longer, anyway.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Quit your japery!” Felicia cried back.  “You’ve no such strength!  None!  None at all!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With a twirl, she then held her staff forward and flat, calling unto herself accretions of odyl from all around.  The air in their courses coldened unto clouds of diamond dust, glittering and dancing.  A stance of artistry—and a favourite of Felicia’s.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><strong>“Glārea Pruīnae!!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At once, the cold collected into fist-thick hunks of floating hail.  Summoning five was already a feat, yet my eyes sighted a greater count: ten—nay, even more so.  Rapid chirps next pierced the air.  They had bolted, speedy blurs now bound for my midst.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Whether inspired by preference or perception, Felicia’s was a shrewd hand to have sent the Glārea Pruīnae against a foe such as I.  Sundering spells was my winning card; not without swinging the <i>svǫrtaskan</i> could it be played.  Then perhaps her mind was to employ a spell unanswerable by swordsmanship.  Not a flying ball of fire nor a bulwark of flames, but veritable gunne-stones of ice, smaller and many in number, fired all at once to pin down her prey.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But just as my sister was no stock sorcerer, so was I no stock swordsman.  With scant time left, I stood poised, taking up the low guard and locking my gaze upon the line of fire.  Eschewing focus upon any one missile, I took them all instead for a single flock, that I might scry the mind behind their movements.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Twelve.  That was their count.  Eight were aimed elsewhere, to strike me in my escape—or root me down for the remnant four.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So be it.  Daring no motion, I immediately emptied my lungs and eased my every sinew.  Only a slice of a second now till contact, a meagre span for the preparation to follow.  But I could not panick.  Not here.  A misstep and I’d be blasted to bits.  Taming my nerves, I relaxed the last lengths of my body and melded my mind into the very air about me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">..</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Done.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In my eyes: ice, flickering in reflection.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In my body: sinews, surging asudden.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In the air: the sword of soot, soaring.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hhhupf!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Kkhaakkhnn!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A shriek of shattered ice.  Four tones in tight unison.  Struck out of the air by the blackblade, the halved hailstones dissipated into a fine mist.  Beyond it was Felicia’s form, standing stunned.  Assailed by one absurdity after another, hers seemed a mind scarce caught up to the moment.  The feeling was mutual, to be frank, as still was I reeling from our reunion here at the horntip of Londosius.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A reunion not of love and levity, but violence…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Or perhaps I ought see the silver lining, instead.  “A life in want of certainty at least never wants for excitement.”  Yes.  A jolly motto to follow.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Nay.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such naïveté ill-lives in so wicked a world.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Stung again by the mercilessness of Man’s machinations, I instinctively clenched the sword of soot with renewed resolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　∵　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">“No…” my sister muttered, lungs heavy.  “No sword ought unmake a magick… none…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A slight shiver haunted her shoulders.  Unsurprising; Felicia was a sorceress extraordinaire, a devout of the magicks—and their arrant dependant.  To have them all avail her so little, so asudden; to see her Yoná-given talent, her years of toil so clearly cleft in two, surely came as a shock to her.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yet <i>this</i> sword can,” I rebutted.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“No!” she cried, shaking her head.  “What madness!  I-I’ll not believe it!  I won’t!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then don’t,” I firmly returned.  “Believe or deny as you like.  If you cannot trust to the truth afore your very eyes… go ahead.  Shut them.  Shield that pride of yours.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Gh…!”</i> she winced, a child cornered by criticism.  And in scolding her had I been edging closer, prowling with wary paces.  Not yet had she reckoned the full reach of my charge, but she should think it quite short, by my guess.  Her fatal blunder, if so; what remained was to arrive in range, and…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Striking… shattering my ice in their <i>flight…?”</i> my sister muttered again, yet mired in disbelief, “&#8230;you show one deception after another…!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Not deception, Felicia.  <i>Discipline,”</i> I corrected.  “The sword has answered my faith.  This ‘twig’ now <i>topples</i> your ‘titans’.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“&#8230;hh!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A pained expression, not unlike another shown winters ago.  <i>‘Is there meaning?’</i> she’d enquired me then.  Meaning in swinging the sword, cutting naught but air.  Meaning in walking the woeful path, knowing naught but futility.  At last, the answer was clear—to us both.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Still…” she inly wrangled on, “&#8230;still, I… I can’t…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Separating us now: a span fewer than five passūs, shrinkable to nought were I given but a breath to dare it.  So all along Felicia’s figure I looked, reckoning the rhythm of her respiration.  And the instant I scried her body at its laxest, her lungs at their emptiest—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hhet!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—I lunged.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia’s eyes flashed, her silverstaff flourished.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><strong>“F-Frīgidus Ensis!!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Vvfaaohh!!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">About her accreted wintry gales, stopping as soon as they had started.  Forming out of them: crystals of airborne ice, keen daggers each, splaying and speeding in now to dice me alive—all twenty of them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Egh!!”</i> I groaned.  A score of dancing blades, catching me unawares but with only a single sword to answer them.  “Damn it!”  I broke my charge, bounding off and barely eluding the bladed blurs.  Hoary air hissed past.  Screeches whistled.  Rounding about, they returned with all speed, and facing them, I jerked and twisted to and fro in avoidance as their darting became more and more daring.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“So you can twirl that twig—what of it!?” Felicia cried.  “Soon or late, even the mightiest boughs must break!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Twenty blades, zig-zagging independently.  Twenty puppets, strung to one mind—now more than before was I reminded of my sister’s prowess.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And her limits.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A genius of spellweaving she was, but equally a simpleton of sword-wielding: though the blades flitted about fleetly, filling the air with myriad chirps and shrieks, none had hitherto closed in for the kill.  Wagering on the safe thought, I began striking them down one-by-one, all the while bearing caution and seeking a chance to charge upon my foe.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Keekh!  Bakhnn!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Frozen blades, broken as they sailed and sniped.  A clear and crystalline rhythm, during which <i>it</i> finally flickered: a lull most transient.  Snatching the opportunity, I leapt forth, sending the black sword towards my sister—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—to stab her straight through.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Aaakh!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A wrenching scream.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At last, my blade had met its mark.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet… all the sooted sword did savour was but a grazing wound upon my sister’s shoulder.  The transgression was swiftly chided: unto me then converged every remnant blade of ice.  Turning quick, I engaged the deadly darts, culling them till their very last.  At length, the air was empty again, with Felicia once more fled to a safer distance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There she was: standing and grasping her left shoulder.  Under those tight fingers trickled deep crimson.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Brother…” she muttered, “&#8230;has spilt my blood…  Brother’s blade…!  <i>My blood…!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Laid full-bare was Felicia’s bewilderment.  And for me, just the same: a surge of emotions assailing me at once, turbid as it was terrible.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Once upon a recent time had I imagined this moment.  But to <i>live</i> it was a betrayal against all expectation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Carving through her flesh—the faint but infallible feeling yet haunted my hands like a memory of murder, a blustery storm beating away at my bosom down to its very depths.  Before I knew it, my face was twisted in turmoil, my teeth clenching as though bearing a deathly pain.  All sound had sped away to some great yonder, leaving naught but my heart to hammer away in my ears.  So ghastly was the struggle that were I any less collected, I might’ve collapsed then and there.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet I didn’t.  I couldn’t.  Not here.  Not now.  This, I had to endure.  My resolve, I had to realise.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Yes.  That’s right.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My <i>resolve.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I’d steeled myself for this.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This deed that must needs be done.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Catching my lungs idled, I resumed respiring.  My body, I re-emboldened.  My spirits, I resuscitated.  From my mind I rejected all remnant sensation of having sheared the flesh of my kin… to whom I next gave my gaze.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And whose name spilt from my lips.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Felicia…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My bond of blood.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The same blood now streaming down her shoulder.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Smears and rivulets of red, an ocean drowning my brotherly heart.  How it harrowed me to reel it back up, to re-narrow my every nerve to the battle at hand.  As this was exactly that: a battle.  For the souls I’d sworn to protect.  For a future that might foster them all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I forcefully inhaled, feeding precious air back to my brain, before calming my heart and cooling my thoughts—I must needs scry what would come next, and carefully.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Above—that’s where Felicia stood.  Above and beyond my prior expectations.  An epiphany reached for the first time in this fight, for never could I have imagined her mastery of so close-quartered and contrarian a spell like the Frīgidus Ensis.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Oft do battlefields find sorcerers assigned to more distant perches, where they might employ their magicks with precision and impunity.  Thus are near-ranged spells left wholly neglected, save for the errant case or by the eclectic adept.  With nary a niche to fill nor shortcuts to their arduous mastery, and withal too many subtleties needed for their deft use, such spells are long regarded as naught more than tricks of the parlour.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But not so to my sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">She’d taken the trek less travelled, not only mastering one such spell, but availing her very life with it on this day.  Felicia Buckmann—a preeminent spellweaver, through and through.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet one fact remained: not without paying a great toll of odyl could the Frīgidus Ensis be woven.  A toll exacted more heavily again from Felicia, for though it had proven a gainly gambit for busying my blade, it was no fewer than a <i>score</i> of the icy-steels that she’d conjured up, and in an instant, at that.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">As though to corroborate my guess, Felicia’s breathing was now reduced to a laboured pant.  Tonitrus, Globus Igneus, Flagrāns Vallum, Feriēns Flagrum, Glārea Pruīnae—and Frīgidus Ensis, all incanted to supreme scale and quantity.  Indeed, not even a wunderkind like herself, though availed by a nigh-bottomless well of odyl, could remain untouched by such expenditure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The way to victory was opened, then.  But as I pondered how I might wend through it—<i>bang!</i>—clapping through the air next was an explosion, birthed from the bowels of the bastille overlooking our battle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Mn?”</i> I twitched, broken from my thoughts.  The cause of the commotion: a Lancea Calōris spell, like as not.  Right; at this very moment were my braves, too, embroiled in their own battle somewhere in that building.  To catch wind of their combat ought’ve been obvious enough.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But in beholding the bastille so fully did an unnamed emotion begin gnawing away at me.  Visions next awoke in my heart.  Of Mia, captive and made to suffer in those depths cruelties beyond description.  Of her elder sister, forced unto her forlorn fate: to be thrown out of hand into some pit—as a blackened and blighted corpse.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nay.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My heart was <i>yet</i> uncalmed, my nerves <i>yet</i> full-frayed, my mind <i>yet</i> a mire.  In truth, <i>never</i> had I actually recovered from the whelm of wounding my own sister.  A moment of meandering, enough to steal my eyes and wits away from the battle at hand.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A newly embarked path, fogging over afore Rolf the fledgeling renegade.  Shame, indeed.  And an affront to Mia, were she to see me now.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And a chance for Felicia.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hha!!”</i> I gasped.  My fit of hesitation had yielded her precious time: turning to her now, I found her freshly finished from preparing her next spell.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">One might wonder, what ensues after a free moment given to a conjurer of her calibre?  The answer was mine to know… and rue.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><strong>“Kōkūtós!!”</strong></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Mnh!?”</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia—a hand from hell she’s played!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And now, a great cerulean cell—cincturing me from all sides!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All was subsumed in blue.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I’d been snared.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…Completely and utterly severed from the outside world.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“────kh!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No time for thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No time to choose.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My fey body bent forth.  My failing blade flourished.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Gshanngh!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Through a facet of the cell the soot-steel stabbed, collapsing the cubic construction straightway.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ggha… hhakh…!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Freed from purgatory, I, too, collapsed onto my knees, barely bearing myself up with the support of my sword.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">From the time the spell had sprung till my escape, naught more than a slice of a second had passed.  Yet it well-felt an eternity.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Kōkūtós: the most supreme of the freezing magicks.  A spell to envelope a victim, and in its infernal space, cease and suffocate all living force found within.  A prison carrying out the sole and swift sentence of death… one the <i>svǫrtaskan</i> had more swiftly acquitted me from.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But I was not fled without foulness.  The instant the cell was erected, its wiles were already at work.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so I was injured.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My every limb, my every bone, my every organ—taken right to Death’s door.</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">Heavy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Numb.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The weight of a thousand wounds unseen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How alluring the earth looked.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Like a cool bed after a day’s labour.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Or a warm grave after a wintry life.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But still.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still I clung to my sword.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I… I see…  Bites that bitterly, does it?” so wheezed my words.  “No account recalls… any soul surviving… the Kōkūtós…  Not till today…  A precious precedent, wouldn’t you say…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A pained play at composure as I surveyed the violence wrought upon me.  I then forced my gaze forward might and main, only to find Felicia standing fallowed of all wit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ah…. a-aah…”</i> she murmured, lost and lorn-like.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Felicia,” I called to her.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Br… Brother…  I… I’ve tried… to k… ki… Br…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Felicia…!” I called again, still bent and buckled on my knees.  Straining my eyes, I peered upon her face, watching it well up with pallour.  Incanting the Kōkūtós surely must’ve drained her dry by now, but such was not the sole weariness sallowing her.  No, for that selfsame spell was a death-magick, conjured by Felicia upon her own brother.  Attempted fratricide, then, seemed the ghastlier ghost haunting her hale.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Wh… why…?  I… I only…” she mumbled on, void of all volition for further battle.  To hail her out of concern, vulnerable foe that she was, might’ve amounted to another betrayal on my part, but none of that mattered—now more than ever did my sister need her brother.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Felicia, listen to me…!” I cried once more, whereupon she twitched and turned my way.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“…Brother…?” Felicia responded weakly, almost in a whisper.  “What… what’ve I…?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You’ve done no wrong,” I assured her.  “Fight, Felicia.  <i>Fight!</i>  For all you’ve sworn to protect!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That’s right.  Between us was not some debate to decide whose was the errant path, for cause and creed both were what had brought us to this battlefield.  Wagers of war, we and all, forced to follow through on our dearest beliefs.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Or die in the endeavour.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“B… but… y…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I shook my head.  “&#8230;No, Felicia.  It’s not to be…  Would that we each could forge a future together, hand-in-hand.  With our neighbours, our brethren… our beloved.  But… it’s a sad thing, truly, that such fortune ill-finds every soul.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Words awakening in Felicia a frigid shiver.  Her face twisted with lament; her lips blanched from all blush.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yet souls we remain… carrying each our own creed, our own conviction,” I continued.  “Thus in daring our destiny must we face our fate…  We must fight—<i>each other.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I… <i>I…!!”</i> Felicia quiveringly cried, tears coursing down her cheeks.  Seeing it now, hers was a face most fair, even when wilted with woe.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How proud I was, to have a sister so abundant in beauty.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How pained I was, to be the brother breaking it all to pieces.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I was ever yours…!  Ever yearnful, ever yearning…!  But so asudden…!  So asudden… did you stop being my dear Brother…!  The Brother I wanted!  The Brother I needed!  You took him away from me!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia, weeping and wailing.  Many winters of fettered feelings, now taking wing.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Always…!  Always… have I… you…!  Ever… ever and always…!” she went on brokenly.  “&#8230;Yet…  <i>and yet!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yet forge ahead we must.  Fight we must,” I returned, rising to my feet.  “&#8230;Felicia.  We are foes now…  You and I!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Aaaa────ah!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My sister’s soaring scream—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—answered now by a storm of odyl.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sweeps and swirls of armillary magick all around her, unto whom then collected and coalesced many columns of blood-black levin.  Stinging and snapping, raging and roaring: throes of thunder rupturing earth and air alike.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At such a sight my eyes widened.  “This levin…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Waving forth: my sister’s silverstaff.  Behind its grim glimmer: a mournful glower.  “If my foe you shall be… then…!  Then <i>be no more!!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Frīgidus Ensis, Kōkūtós—two spells that’d earned my every awe.  Yet here and now was Felicia daring a deadlier height.  Lightning flaming lightlessly—a first to my eyes, but not a doubt to my mind: afore me was a magick nigh-unmastered by any in all the reaches of this realm.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia then loosed another scream, as though to settle my suspicions.  A scream drowning in tears, retelling the tantrums of her littlest years:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><strong>“Igniēns Ĭcendō!!”</strong></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/lightnovelstranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sskvol3illus07.png?resize=759%2C1079&#038;ssl=1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Unto her silverstaff: a convergence of the raven-red levin.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Fired new from its silver head: an endless length of lancing heat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Igniēns Ĭcendō—a magick marking the foe’s flesh and laying forth an ineluctable trajectory.  Riding upon that path: a levin-line, sent with such speed so as to pierce through its prey with absolute certainty.  Doggedly does it seek.  Deathly does it strike.  A spell suffering no escapee, no matter the distance, no matter the defence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I quickened my thoughts.  Time tarried.  In that stilled instance played the vying of our minds, the next move whereof would reckon both victor and vanquished.  I knew my hand; what of Felicia’s?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My stare turned to hers, to read the heart hid behind that ruby-red regard.  And there, I saw it at once.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Willfulness.  Unwillingness.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Half-steeled.  Full-sorrowed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A fight unforsakable.  A fight unfinishable.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There she stood, aface the proverbial crossroads, anguishing in indecision, torn betwixt duty and desire.  And in espying her despair did I know her designs: it was not my head nor my heart that her spell sought to extinguish.  And neither was it any of my limbs, for in sundering just one would bring no clean end to this fight yet.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Where she’d aimed… was my abdomen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Back from my thoughts I thundered.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Springing to me: a spear of screaming Light.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sweeping afore me: the sword of severing Dark—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—swung to a speed more desperate and defiant than all I’ve dared in my life.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<img src="https://i0.wp.com/lightnovelstranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/sskvol3illus06.png?resize=759%2C1079&amp;is-pending-load=1#038;ssl=1">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Vhaaahhnng!!</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such a shriek shot through the air.  And with it, tufts and tendrils of sanguine-black odyl, fanning out in a fading flower-bloom from the meeting of metal and magick.  In the wake of the sword-sweep was silken soot, feathering about in ribbons and rivulets.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so was vanquished the unavoidable magick.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Gegh…!”</i> I groaned, faltering against the gravity of the all-body pain.  Still, I endured it and stayed astood.  But this was grim.  Fatally so.  Already I’d taken too many wounds from the Kōkūtós, none visible to the naked eye: my flesh, my organs, my bones—all of them were marred.  Recuperation required time, but time was up: Felicia’s next spell would speak my end.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet, only silence hung.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Wending my wavering vision to my sister, I found her trembling uncontrolled.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“A… aa…”</i> she breathed in broken gasps.  Was it despair?  At having her champion magick unmade afore her very eyes?  Or was it indignance?  At her faithful forte failing at every turn?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nay.  It was both…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Gh… agh… gohokh…!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…and one more.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia had foundered full to the ground, and was now gripped by a fit of vomiting—a symptom of being sapped asudden of all odyl.  What I’d thought was an impossibility was here on full display: Felicia’s unfathomable prowess, spent to the last drop.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Had she more to her mettle than just magicks, had she honed her craft even a mite more sharply… and had she been any less the sister I’ve always known, then this vie might’ve veered a different course.  Indeed, were her words and spellweaving more wiley, certainly could she’ve caught me in some magicked cunning, with the wrath-red levin having long blasted a void through my belly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Aubh… bwahohh…!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet her miring emotions had got the best of her: unbolstered and unembellished was her Igniēns Ĭcendō.  Thus was I able to answer it in full.  An outcome perhaps exacted by our experiences, our paths, once so inseparable, now sundered all those winters ago.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still, the more grievous wounds were found in my flesh, not Felicia’s.  If not yet would she yield, then this hour would be my last…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hha… khahahh…!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Gently did the curtains close.  More so than I could have imagined.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With labour and languor, Felicia dragged herself up to her feet…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">..</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">..</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…and turned away.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Away, to totteringly flee our blood-feud.  Away from this fraught fight, where her magicks had been maimed, her odyl spent unto deficit.  A brigadier of the Order, broken in battle, soiled and sallowed, slowly receding into the distance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Felicia…” I whispered, watching my once-dear sister in pitiable retreat.  Forth went a foot of mine.  To find her.  To follow her.  But my body sooner slumped to the dirt, too weighed down by its wounds.  What weakness.  And yet… what relief.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Relief dirtied with doubt.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Doubt for myself.  Doubt for my resolve.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">After desperately defying the twenty blades of the Frīgidus Ensis had I closed the distance and dealt a wound upon my sister.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A mere shallow, skin-shearing wound.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But was I truly desperate?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Too desperate to full-brandish the blackblade?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A whole score of airborne daggers had I to answer, sure.  But reflecting on it, I did not think myself so hard-put at that time.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Something… somewhere in me had stayed my hand.  Some part of me, too pained at the thought of slaying my own sister.  If not for it, would my blade have broken more deeply into Felicia’s flesh?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And found a heart to hew?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;A trembling traitor.  A second-guessing alga…  Is that all you are?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A question, quietly and cuttingly directed at myself, as I stared at Felicia fading from all view.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　∵　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">The main gate laid in ruin.  Deep had our flood of braves poured into the concentration camp.  The violence had spilt thence unto the open baileys, whereupon did we continue to this moment our bitter vie with the Fiefguard and their Zaharte brothers.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Fräulein!” called one of my braves to me.  “We’ve secured the wounded!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Good!” I answered above the din of combat.  “We rally now!  All of you, together with Staffel Seven!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Amidst my hest-giving, the air yonder cracked from an irruption of laughter, wild and bloodthirsted.  Stamping next through the warring crush was its source: a bull of a Man, clenching fast in his gauntlets a halberd, long and thrice-bladed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I founds ye, me dainty dark-sow!” he taunted, eyes hooked to me.  “Come!  Us dance’s not done yet!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Who’s a sow…!?” I muttered.  Unimaginative be Men with their insults for my folk.  Yet “dark-sow” was a first to these ears of mine, and young frau that I was, the slight pricked too deep into the nerves.  An answer was in order, one to remind him who’s the swine for true—mayhaps with a kick to his snout!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ye’ll be squealin’ soon ‘nough!  When I skins that there ‘ide o’ yers!” he croaked on, gaining upon me with hulking strides.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Tch!”</i>  Biting my lip, I readied my two longdaggers once more.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A sore to admit, but though I craved much his downfall, this Man was proving too hard a boulder to crack.  And not only he—by all accounts, our number ought hold the advantage, but ‘twas in grappling with these coin-Men of Zaharte that our momentum had begun to flag.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This halberdier in particular; his might I reckoned two—nay, <i>fourfold</i> more daunting than his comrades’.  With but a swing of his three-faced weapon could he mow in twain many bodies at once, armoured or no.  And should those bodies be ours…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I shudder to think.  And thus had I challenged the Mennish fiend himself, to leash his eyes away from the braves.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Yyah!!”</i> I shouted, as ill-awaiting his arrival, I bolted forth with my longdaggers, both blades speeding to his neck.  But right before they gained their mark, I was forestalled, as up swept next the head of the halberd.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Rrryaah!”</i> the Man howled, unshrunken by my evasion, for why I found out soon enough—the halberd’s shaft-butt followed, whipping up and striking me square under the chin.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Aegh!”</i>  I reeled back, my vision trembling wild.  Yet my body recouped at once, leaping back by its own will and escaping bare the second stroke of the halberd.  Earth was axed.  Dust blasted.  Behind the fuming air cackled the halberdier.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Tricky trotters you’ve got there, eh mirk-swine!?  A nigh shame t’shear ‘em off!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Gh…!”</i> I scowled back.  No doubt was in me now.  Smirking mad afore me was none other than “Ulrik”, high member of Zaharte and Sigmund’s former battle-brother.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With excitement had our witnessing braves recounted it: yesternight’s deadly dance anear the gates of Arbel.  Of how, against evil odds, Rolf had left both Sigmund sundered of blade and Ulrik slashed of bosom.  If not for their friends’ swift rescue, ‘twas most certain that the duo were half-eaten carrion by this hour.  Such was our braves’ unanimous conclusion, but in my ears, it sounded more a fancy.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For how had Rolf done it?  How had he kept at bay the two dreadnaughts?  And not least cornered them to the verge of defeat?  Try as I might, I could not guess; vying with but one of them was proving a fey struggle in itself, for this Ulrik had thus far bared no vulnerability that my eyes could scry.  Indeed, yet again was I reminded in full what mountainous prowess there lived in Rolf.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet I dared not drowse in his shadow forever.  And neither could I dare falter against an enemy whom he’d handled with divided mettle.  No.  I could not fail here.  I could not.  Too much weighed upon these shoulders.  Too much expectation.  Too much hope.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Child to a jarl though I was, never was I certain to someday sit upon the high seat.  Still, in me my people felt much the same fire as my father’s.  Burning fiercest was my arm and mind for battle, a talent apparent since my earliest springs and praised for just as long.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But as a blossoming frau, never could I receive such war-like words with any real gladness.  They instead reminded me of my place, my duty, my solemn honour as daughter to the jarl of the Vílungen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Faces, on one day aglow with expectation and pride; on another, dead-tense in the heat of battle.  The faces of Berta, Volker, and many more—all whom I held dear, all who’d long minded me and kept me on the rightwise path… each and every one of them were embroiled in this eternal war that I might thrive in safety, that the meeker of our folk might know some relief from the daily threats at our door.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Their struggles, their sacrifices—none could I baulk.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Our home, our dear ones—none I wished to lose.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thus had I chosen to put my talents to use and fight alongside my battle-brethren.  From skirmishes to campaigns, wheresoever my blades were needed, I went.  To the banks of the Erbelde, too, had I marched, but ‘twas there that lightning had struck upon me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A thunderbolt of a Man, wielding a sword no less swift… to outspeed my own daggers, the fleetness whereof I’d long thought was unanswerable.  To my eyes, that flashing blade of his was more than some threat: ‘twas a shot of sunlight, a spark for my awakening, most true.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Many other Men in that campaign could’ve boasted of more decorations and storied mettle, not least Londosius’ paragon herself, the sword-maiden Estelle Tiselius, to whom droves of our number had we lost.  But all my mind was paid instead to this one Man.  For though he was sullied and bruised, cut-up and ablood all over; for though his bones were fain to buckle and his sinews begged for respite… he yet stood, baring his steel and handing me my defeat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Harsh was this enlightenment.  To the shallowness of my resolve.  To the heights I had yet to endeavour.  To the cruelness of this world, where one could scarce protect aught without mastering such depths and summits of discipline.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so I gave myself to it.  All of it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For three years on, I relented not in honing my skill, tempering myself with such focus of mind that before long was I deemed fit to lead a Gewölbe of my own.  Yet, ‘twas not enough.  For those same three years saw that Man whetted to a keenness far beyond my imagining.  The gap of capability, gaping wider now than even before.  Such I’d on the night of our reunion.  Such I’d felt as Rolf risked life and limb to deliver my people.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Envy was alive in me.  Yet in envy I could not dwell; too little time there was for it in the five days since our re-meeting.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…A mere five days.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The defeat of the hundred-score sackers at Hensen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The bloodless capture of Balasthea.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The deception and culling of Arbel’s defenders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The breaching of the fief-burgh.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And now, this fatal battle, waged against the remnant Fiefguard after the unexpected death of their lord.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All in only <i>five</i> days.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ström, verging on tearing away from the weave of Londosius: a watershed victory, once but a dream teased by centuries of struggle, now nigh-attained by a week’s end.  Indeed none amongst us could’ve thought any of this possible, not as we were before these fateful five days.  But upon Rolf joining our cause, so asudden were the wheels set into motion.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Against this war was he set.  To end it.  To defeat Londosius itself.  More than aught, I wished not to be left from his great endeavour.  No, I wanted to join my hands with his, to help deal the realm-felling stroke, to usher in the long-awaited dawn for my long-shadowed people.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I had Berta’s memory, too, to consider.  When that second mother of mine lost herself in sacrifice, when the last moment of her life was nearing its end, in her fading eyes did I see some great task meant for me.  Knowing Berta, ‘twas this, no doubt: her little children—she’d bade me save them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Then saved they shall be.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Their futures, assured.  This war, ended.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But to cut the new path, I must be more than I am.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I must be resolute…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I must be steeled!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ready to see all my promises to their ends!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ready to lead the charge!  To fight till my last breath!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Filled with the fires of determination, I flourished my blades, and with a mighty swing, thrust and threw them straight at my foe.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ulrik’s eyes flashed wide.  <i>“Nm!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But to my annoyance, his mettle remained unmarred: heaving the haft of his long halberd, he thwarted my thrown blades—<i>kha-khakhnn!</i>—and sent them flying clear up into the air.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hah!” he snorted in triumph.  But his eyes had scried not the third blade thrown.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A blade—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—by the name of Lise!</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I lunged and leapt forth to the level of his eyes, seeing them flashing again with surprise at the sight of this “dark-sow” in flight.  Instinct ignited him as he thrust his halberd at once, but by then had I already flown past its many-bladed head.  Snatching swift the haft, I pulled myself further forth—</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Gwabfh!?”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">—to bring these “tricky trotters” crashing into his countenance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A dropkick, reckless beyond all reason.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In that instant, I felt upon my heels the crunching collapse of Ulrik’s nose.  Back he bent, crashing down unto the dirt as blood blew from his nostrils.  I mounted him straightway, and snatching one of my blades out of its fall—<i>“Haa──h!!”</i>—drave its keen point through Ulrik’s heart.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Dhkharh!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Deep it delved, down through the Man’s body, nailing him to the earth as an effigy to the altar.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Ghukkhh…!”</i> he gagged, spewing blood and staining my cheeks.  <i>“&#8230;Ngh… hhaa…”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">One final effort from his lungs, and at last all strength left his hands.  With a thump, his long-trusty halberd fell out of his grip to rest upon the dirt.  His eyes twitched in their sockets as they stared on and on at mine, whilst his jaws quivered, as though in attempt to give air to his last words.  But failing, he choked on his blood… and gave his spirit to the winds.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Witnessing his end, I drew myself up to my feet and wiped the wet red from my cheeks.  A moment, and there next swelled roaring cheer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“He’s slain!  The hireling’s slain!  A feat by our Fräulein!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Praise be to her prowess!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“She flew like a butterfly!  Stung like a buffalo!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That last line, I should remember.  And the face besides that dared it.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Looking all along the battle about me, I sighted more of the Zaharte hirelings.  But what a gladness, that our braves had held fast to wiser tactics, engaging the sellswords with many against one.  And by my reckoning, no more foes of Ulrik’s equal ought yet remain here—this battle, then, was on its last throes.  What was left were the captives&#8217; extraction… and the enemy commanders sitting in their perch: the siblings Viola and Theodor, themselves the greatest threat on this battlefield.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Not by my present mettle could I fell those two.  No, just Ulrik had me close enough to Death’s door.  But I fretted little.  For hunting them down now was an ally of ours, whose own mettle was skies above my own.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">We shall win this, then.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Win, and on this day, see new-changed the course of history.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But tarrying now will bring it no closer.  Driven by the thought, I turned back to the battle at hand, ready to show my dawned resolve.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　∵　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">The body crumpled.  Dust sprang.  Redness seeped.  Struck by the felling of one of their own, the four other Fiefguardsmen turned to the offender—and once-thought ally.  Their voices vaulted.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“W… wot’s th’meanin’ o’ this!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ye’ve sold yer sword t’the wrong side, ‘ireling!  A backstabbin’ this is!  ‘Gainst Crown an’ Country both!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sigmund spat in response.  “I ain’t the dagger-man ‘ere!” he thundered in defiance.  Then, thumping his chest, “Your <i>Crown</i> an’ <i>Country’s</i> wot’s done the stabbin’!  An’ they’ve stab’d the <i>wrong back!”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The pinnacle of pride, to so brand one’s birthland the sooner knifer.  Holst could but hang his jaw in disbelief as he witnessed the warring words… and the weapons that danced thereafter.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Die, treacher!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Unto Sigmund then sprang the Fiefguardsmen, like hounds loosed upon a lone prey.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Holst jolted at the sight.  “No…!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">They were close—<i>too</i> close!  Five were encircling Sigmund the instant he had entered the scene; four now thanks to his ambush, but that was no comfort.  Falchions next fell upon him from every direction.  <i>Too late,</i> thought Holst, but his body judged otherwise as, against all prudence, it sped desperately to avail this sudden ally.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But in a blink—<i>“Fwegh!?”</i>—spewed a yelp, yielded by a Fiefguardsman.  Hammering into the soldier’s face was the hilt of Sigmund’s sword; crushed was his nose, shattered were his teeth, as to the ground he fell and fainted.  And yet the violence was hardly finished, for that same sword had already found new flesh for its feast.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Khraagh!?”</i> came the next scream from a now crumpling corpse.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He had been well-surrounded, Sigmund.  But a mere second, and he had hewn the danger down to half.  Such fleet fury affrighted the remnant foes, stopping them in their tracks.  Sigmund seized the moment and let loose another lunge of his sword.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Rrruaahh!”</i> he roared, full-rending another Fiefguardsmen.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In desperation, or perhaps some half-hearted vengeance, the very last foe-blade plunged down upon Sigmund’s side.  And so up soared his own to slap it away, before galing down to gore through his final mark.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Khagh…!”</i>  Thus expired the last of the waylayers; thus ended the flash of a fight.  Five Fiefguardsmen, made as meal for the worms in a wisp of a moment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Frantically had Holst offered his succour, but it had proved a fool’s errand.  So soon was the victory, so daunting the strength on display, that he was left standing speechless.  Still, before he could blush from his blunder, Holst found himself pierced by an epiphany.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Indeed it was succour that he had offered.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet to whom but Sigmund.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A son of <i>Man.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Tch!”</i> so struck that son’s tongue; pity—teetering on indignance—darkened his eyes.  He looked all through the escapees, finding not few of them to be: “&#8230;Gammers an’ gaffers, innit…” he ruesomely muttered.  “&#8230;Bloody ‘ell.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sigmund then pointed his thumb aback at the unbarred gate.  Seeing his signal, the braves and captives both began moving at once.  But as  he watched them, the sword-for-hire noticed something amiss.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Stopping Holst amidst the fleeing file, he cried, “Oi!  Where’s that Rolf Bug-muncher gone, ah?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“B-bug…?  H-he fights, if you wonder,” the Staffelhaupter answered, half-confused for a moment.  “Mighty marks remain amongst the enemy yet.  Rolf faces one of them as we speak.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Marks mighty and more; in speaking of them did Holst recall the young sorceress who had been standing in wait outside the bastille.  Her conduct, her confidence… a glimpse of her and he knew at once: she was <i>not</i> to be trifled with.  Equally so with the Östberg siblings, who were as yet unencountered and uncontested.  Indeed, upon this battlefield there still prowled foes most formidable, but whose living breaths were a barrier to the Nafílim cause.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hmph,” Sigmund scoffed, content.  “Good.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You mean to aid him?” Holst asked in turn, and nigh-naturally, at that.  But of course he did, for he now saw in Sigmund an ally—and as well, a saviour.  Of the boy to be sacrificed, of the braves and captives here; a Man risking life and livelihood for whom but the <i>nemeses</i> of his realm—the same realm against which now burned his flame of rebellion.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hah!  That bull o’ a blade needs no ‘and-’oldin’!” snorted Sigmund, recalling the ungraced.  “Well, methinks, at least.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;I see.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Holst felt then some relief.  The reason: this same Sigmund had once measured swords with Rolf.  And so surely must he know well of Rolf’s prowess.  After all, songs of clashing steel oft reveal of the wielders what words cannot.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Regardless, Rolf’s battle with the sorceress was naught the Staffelhaupter himself could avail.  But just as the wolfsteel warrior had his own task to tackle, so did Holst, one now nearing completion: with “help” from his late brother, the captives were secured and in tow.  All that was left was to quit the camp and leave the rest of the battle to the Nafílim army.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Spurred by the thought, Holst then hurried after the others, but before a foot of his could fall, a stampede rumbled anew in the distance.  His ears pricked, his stomach turned—more Fiefguardsmen were on the way.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Come back ‘ere, ye curs!”  This, and many like lines littered the air as filing fast from the bastille precinct were fresh pursuers.  Eight was their count, each with eyes bloodshot from sheer foeship.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“They’re many, Herr Holst!  Over-many!” warned a brave.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Away at once!  All of you!” Holst commanded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To safety must these captives be escorted.  Only, safety was nowhere in sight, not even in Sigmund’s shadow, not even far beyond the service gate where other allies stood in wait, ready to receive them.  No, these chasers wanted the captives dead, and <i>only</i> dead, and seemed all too fain to follow it through to a bitter end.  Even from afar, such intent was evident on their mad mien.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so must they be stopped.  Shouldering the shepherd’s charge, Holst turned away.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I’ll hold them off,” he declared, and faced the fast-approaching Fiefguard.  But as though to steal his thunder, now eclipsing his view of them was Sigmund, stepping brazenly forth.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“No you won’t,” said the mercenary.  “Get shoggin’.  These cullions’re <i>mine</i> to cut.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Compelled by his conviction, the other braves quickly rounded up the cowed captives and began their way to the service gate.  In their departure, not few from the group offered timid thanks to the thunderfall of a Man.  Holst remained, watching Sigmund’s figure in silence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Seeing their Staffelhaupt stolid, one of the braves pressed him, “Herr!  We’ve no time!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Indeed we haven’t…” Holst said at last, before turning a glance to his comrades.  “&#8230;The captives, I leave in your care.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;What!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The other braves gaped, but their leader was set.  Holst ventured forth his own steps, and there stood beside Sigmund.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To which up bent a brow of the brute.  “Mate.  They’re <i>mine,</i> I said.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That you did.  And that they are.  Still…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still were the foes superior in number.  Still was ill-faded the fates’ humour.  And should their dice fall to Sigmund’s woe…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>…then must I offer him the saving throw—my sword!</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Something, somewhere deep in Holst’s heart, roused those very words.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He had thought of it mere moments before, that not all Men deserved disdain.  Such Men as Rolf.  Such Men… as Sigmund.  Verily had the mercenary wagered his life for the braves and their charges.  And verily had Holst hastened to aid him—to aid a <i>Man.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In this very moment was something stirring in the Staffelhaupt’s soul.  Something dear, something precious beyond all price.  A sprout, neither to be neglected nor crushed afoot.  No, it was to be cherished and nurtured strong.  Holst knew this not.  He saw this not.  But he sensed it nonetheless.  And that was enough.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Enough to spur his steps to the fray and unfurl his newfound resolve.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;This sword might avail you yet, son of Man.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Eyes and words unclouded.  Blade and body unquivering.  Met with such a mien, Sigmund could but grin.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hmph,” he huffed.  “Big ballocks you’ve got, mate.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘That you do, Brother.’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So echoed a voice in Holst’s ears.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">∵</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A dozen laid dead about me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Fiefguardsmen, mercenaries—their blood running off my blade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This vicinity’s defences had proven dense enough.  No doubt, then, that anear loomed their highest leaders.  Thinking of them, I trained my eyes up to their possible perch: the top of the watchtower.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What wounds the Kōkūtós had wrought upon me yet remained, but were mended enough to endeavour combat.  And so, trusting my braves with their duty in the bastille, I had taken it upon myself to steal further into this foe-den and seek out the Zaharte commanders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Viola and Theodor Östberg—their undoing should serve the headstones to this battle, and by all means must I have them hewn.  As though to answer my conviction, afore me appeared the siblings themselves: vernal in visage and vigour, descending the tower with leisurely steps.  It seemed they meant to welcome my arrival—with spears glinting in their grips.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Swift comes the storm, I see,” so resounded the sister’s voice.  “Welcome, withersake.  You behold afore you the twin heads of Zaharte: Viola myself, and my brother, Theodor.  What say you before you are no more?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I say: a pleasure, this meeting,” I answered, “and an honour besides—to finally cross blades with you both.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">No lie was upon my lips.  Any warfaring soul ought know of these two, and so was this momentous meeting truly a treasure to a wayside soldier as I.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A pity that it would be our last.</p>
