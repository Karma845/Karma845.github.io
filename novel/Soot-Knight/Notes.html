<p><i>‘&#8230;No…  That… that cannot be…’</i></p>
<p><i>‘&#8230;Emilie…  I’m very sorry…’</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia was returned from Ström.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But glad were neither her spirits nor the tidings she’d brought home with her.  Indeed, when we were sat at last to discuss in earnest what’d befallen that margravate, I could not believe my very ears.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Still, never was Felicia one for flagrant lies, nor one to misreckon a terrible thing so unfolded afore her eyes.  This I knew.  I knew, and yet… I could not bear it.  I could not <i>believe.</i>  And neither did I want to.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>‘&#8230;‘Sorry’&#8230;?  But… how…?  Rolf… how could he…’</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…How could he march with the Nafílim?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And fly their pennons?  And counsel their warpath?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…And wage battle against his own sister?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My stomach turned when I’d heard Felicia’s report, and more still when she next recounted the grazing blow she’d received from Rolf’s blade.  ‘Twas no lie, then.  No lie, and yet…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet it could not be so.  It <i>should not</i> be so.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Why, this was <i>Rolf</i> we were speaking of.  Felicia’s dear brother.  And… and to myself…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…the one to walk alongside me.  The one with whom I wish to spend my every winter, till dotage and death should take us.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Too much yet remained.  To answer for.  To apologise for.  The misunderstandings, the misjudgement, the misheld hearing, the misgiven banishment—these and all.  And only from there would the true trial begin.  Of making amends, of rebuilding what was broken, of rekindling the candle we once shared.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How I longed for this.  How I longed for the chance, one that if given, I should grovel upon the ground afore him, reveal to him my every remorse, and say all the sorries as my lungs would allow, that he might find it in his heart to forgive his dear and foolish Emilie…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…and yet…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>‘&#8230;Emilie…  Brother, he’s… he’s…’</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…so far away.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So, so very far away…</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I opened my eyes, finding myself swaying upon my carriage seat, as on and on I recalled aught and all that Felicia had revealed to me not more than a week before.  Yet no matter how many times it all played through my head, none of the details dared change in the slightest.  No matter how shut an eye I turned to it, never would the nightmare fade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Felicia was sat beside me, wordless the entire journey.  As I looked upon her dour regard, the carriage halted.  Shimmering beyond the window now were ornate gates and many sentinels at attention.  At last were we arrived at the royal palace, centre of Redelberne, and home of the Londosian Crown.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ushered through the regal estate, my retinue and I at length entered into its great hall.  There, solemn grandeur looked to sigh from the very pillars, the walls, the many inlaid mouldings and more.  Lancet windows overlooked from the vaults far, far above, spilling cascades of midlight upon those assembled below.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">None were suffered here excepting the highest authorities of Londosius.  As evidence, situated in this great hall was the high table, shaped from a long slab of walnut and finished and polished so that it sooner seemed marbled than wooden; and sat along its ponderous length were the realm’s high commanders—the mareschals of Londosius’ knightly Orders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The Lady Estelle Tiselius of the 1st.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sir Stefan Cromheim of the 2nd.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sir Matthias Juholt of the 3rd.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And myself: Emilie Valenius of the 5th.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Seated beside them were each their own retinues of leading officers.  Mine was very much the same, with Felicia right at hand.  Though as it happened, none of my Owlcranes could accompany me on this day, for their prior commitments were beyond deferral.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That Brandt,” echoed deep the voice of the Mareschal Juholt.  “His seat—stone-cold as ever, I see.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I beg you forgive my master, good Mareschal,” said a knight—namely the 4th’s under-mareschal, whose face was flush with embarrassment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sir Bo Brandt, Knight Mareschal to the 4th Order.  Ever was he the sort to take absence from meetings as this, and today seemed no different—though it be a summons from the Crown of Londosius itself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And as if on cue, the double doors to this great hall tolled open.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“All rise for Her Royal Highness!” cried the herald, first to enter.  At once, we the assembled stood erect from our seats and duly hailed the incoming procession of attendants, officials, guardsmen, standard-bearers…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…and Her Royal Highness herself: the First Princess Serafina Demeter Londosius.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Long was her satin-silver hair and austere were her pearl-grey eyes.  With a complexion of delicate nacre, the whole of her appearance was alike to the magnum opus of a master dollmaker, a porcelain figure to define the craft itself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Glowing from her mien was sagacity, a match for her native excellence and capacity.  So much so, in fact, that even at her springtide age of eighteen, the princess had been entrusted by her king father with much of his erstwhile prerogative, and so governed in his stead no few affairs of the realm.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The great stir of footfalls presently calmed.  With grace, the princess took her seat at the head of the high table, but soon did much of her royal entourage begin marching their way back out of the great hall, leaving but Her Highness and a scant few others to remain.  ‘Twas expected; doubtless matters of strict confidentiality would be discussed hereon.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Once the doors shut with a long echo, the princess looked all along us defenders of her realm.  “Pray, sit to your comfort,” she bade, to which we all obliged, as did the man beside her: the lord chancellor of the king’s cabinet.  “Your answering our summons during so pressing a time, we thank you for,” said the princess, before turning her eyes to one knight in particular.  “And thee more so, Sir Stefan, and withal those that have suffered like pains for this precarious occasion—from far yonder, indeed, have ye travelled.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“This vassal’s sword is as your own, Your Royal Highness,” Cromheim returned, bowing from his seat.  “Through sand or sleet, ever shall its blade brave aught and all to answer your call.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The knight Sir Stefan Cromheim, mareschal to the 2nd—scarce more than thirty years was his age, though his youthfulness belied those years well, for subtract ten of them, and none would be the wiser.  Especially not women; stories abound of their droves charmed straightway by his groomed locks of sunny bistre, mannerisms soft and sophisticated, and other like facets fair to behold.  Such, too, belied his worth as a man of the military, for he was accounted far and wide as a rightwise knight, able-armed and just of hand and mind.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet his honeyed declaration earned but a faint chuckle from the princess.  “&#8230;Then by those words,” she said to him, “thou wouldst measure the absent mareschal a truant sword than chivalric steel?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Answering in Cromheim’s stead was the 4th’s under-mareschal, who fretted in his seat.  “Your Royal Highness, if I may—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Have ease, good knight,” the princess stayed him.  “Know we well thy master’s worth and ways, of how he availeth our realm even to this moment.  And that is enough,” she said.  “Now shall we hold council.  Chancellor?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yes, Highness,” so obliged from beside the princess the Lord Chancellor Hugo Rudels, a stern man nearing six decades in his years.  Sweeping a look across the table, he then addressed us all.  “As you all have been made aware, we convene today as touching the margravate of Ström.  Or more precisely…” he paused, knitting his lips, “&#8230;the former lands thereof.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Graveness darkened further in us all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That’s right: Ström was lost.  No longer was it a margravate.  No longer was it even of this realm.  No; ‘twas wrested by hands of the Nafílim host.  Such we’d known through classified missives sent from Central leading up to this day, but the weight of the chancellor’s words bore no less crushingly upon our shoulders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And painfully upon my heart.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This very morrow at the royal inn had found me seized by fits of retching and disgorging.  Such was my dread for this moment, my brimming anxiety for this council.  I’d disappear at once, were I allowed, for I wished not one bit to share a word in this matter, nor give ear to any.  This was a topic most anathema, and looking beside me, I was certain the same was so for Felicia, who had hitherto been darkly sat, hushed and downcast.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“From months prior has the fortunes of Balasthea Stronghold been taking turns most fair.  And the Nafílim tide that had so broken upon its walls?  Quite the opposite,” the chancellor recounted.  “To such extent that the Margrave Aaron, Lord of Ström, saw fit to foray into nearby Hensen and herald doom unto that Nafílim nest.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Balasthea—once a fort ever teetering over the edge of destruction.  That its situation was turned ‘round completely was a fact known to every mind in this great hall.  And as well, the fact that such was achieved only after a certain man took up the post as its new acting commandant.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The margrave’s foraying Fiefguard… two thousands strong, they were.  But now, two thousands <i>slain,”</i> the Lord Hugo emphasised.  “Yes, my good Mareschals.  An ill and utter <i>defeat</i> for the score of Man.  Half a hand could well-count the survivors, but not a finger may lift even for Balasthea’s best, for verily had all thirty of them, too, joined the foray.  Not one whereof has returned.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Many brows furrowed.  No recent memory could recall so arrant a defeat.  And certainly no mind could’ve expected the lord of Ström to suffer it, known as he was for his effectivity and long years of keeping the Nafílim at bay.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A host of a hundred score—surely had he scried some glint of victory, to have sent such a number.  Yet as all now knew, ‘twas a light as false as ‘twas fatal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And alas, the Hensenite hounds ill-sat silent.  They marched in vengeance, bending their baleful thought upon Balasthea.  And Balasthea they <i>took,”</i> the chancellor went on.  “Arbel’s remnant men mustered an immediate answer, to be sure, but in their march from the city gates, they were waylaid, and laid low.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Uneasy murmurs frothed through the air.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">We’d all known the “what” of Ström’s fall, but not so much the “how”.   Would that the Fiefguard had barricaded the city instead and stood their ground.  Thus surely would a gladder fate have awaited their land.  Why, then, had they eschewed the safety of their city?  Why risk open battle?  Such questions filled our every head.  The one to air them at last, however, was the mareschal of the 2nd.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“They had but to sit still and steel their walls,” he said.  “What worm was it, I wonder, that had so tempted them from their perch?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The worm of <i>cunning,</i> Mareschal Cromheim,” the chancellor answered.  “Reports tell of Nafílim snakes spreading lies the night prior, of what but the Fiefguard’s <i>‘victory’</i> at Hensen.  Yet occupied as it was, Balasthea would have served but a snare against the unknowing ‘victors’ in their return.  <i>That</i> was the worm the margrave pecked.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Devious, those devil-vermin,” remarked Juholt.  “They played the lord’s pride like a puppet, for no better plan had he if delivering his precious men were foremost on his mind.  Such is certain!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The 3rd’s mareschal huffed grimly.  A man in his early forties, Juholt’s was a sharp face with deep-set eyes, framed by a grown stubble and a crown of short-sheared hair, both dusk-gold in colour.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For fifteen winters and more has this man served as mareschal.  Whether it be of field command or strength of arms, of administering his Order or mastering his temperament, Juholt was as staunch as a bedrock, never to err, never to founder.  Indeed, a veritable lynchpin of the realm’s military, he was ever constant and noble in the face of war.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At such a knight the chancellor nodded.  “But a plan put to motion nonetheless, to the price of seven hundreds more slain,” the Lord Hugo further revealed.  “Already had the margrave lost a hundred scores at Hensen.  And so was his hand too hasty, his cards too few—a fate sealed the moment he bit the bait.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Were that hand mine, consulting the deck might’ve cut a brighter course,” mused Cromheim.  “Mercenaries—some coin for their lot ought’ve bought much breath for the failing Fiefguard, no?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The margrave’s was mayhaps very much the same mind, Mareschal,” the chancellor guessed.  “As it happened, he had, in fact, sought the service of sellswords, for tarrying then in Ström-land were none other than the Zaharte Battalion.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Another sea of murmurs stirred amongst us all.  Zaharte was a name vociferously known to us, not least to every corner of the kingdom itself.  And yet…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Faith!  The lot led by the Östberg siblings!” Juholt cried, smiling.  “Young spears, those two, but more keen and quick than their years let on!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Old acquaintances, I presume, Mareschal Juholt?” the chancellor asked flatly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Indeed.  Though but once did we meet, and long ago,” Juholt nodded.  “Come, Lord Chancellor.  Regale me of their valour.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Valour?”  The Lord Hugo cocked his brows bitterly.  “My dear Mareschal.  They are <i>vanquished.”</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">The sharpness in Juholt’s mien dulled in that moment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Pity,” he yielded in a low voice, before letting fall his gaze.  He seemed for a while greyed asudden by age or trouble, as though reminded of an old sorrow.  A life more than half-spent in war ought’ve numbed his heart to the uncounted, untimely demises of his juniors.  But looking at him, I knew then that no number of years, no hardness of will, could ever prepare one for so solemn a tiding.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The chancellor sighed.  “Yet ere their fall, the margrave had entrusted to the Östbergs total command of his Fiefguard,” his briefing continued.  “As for why, most certainly had he a mind to steal away to the safety of neighbouring Tallien… were it not for his foul luck.  Our agents discovered him a corpse—cloven, cold, and concealed in the wine cellar beneath his manor.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The death of a lord vassal.  The seizing of Londosian land.  ‘Ill and utter defeat’, indeed,” concluded Her Highness.  And though she stressed much the gravity of the loss, not once did her mien seem even warmed by either wrath or shame.  “It was our original mind to send for you all today, that we might take counsel touching twofold the fall of Balasthea and the answer necessary thereof.  But too fickle be the whims of the fates, for Londosius was <i>yet whole</i> when our couriers first took to the road with your summonses,” she explained most deliberately, an effort to impress upon us the exigency of this situation.  <i>“Seven,</i> mine honoured knights.  <i>Seven</i> be the sum of days betwixt the march on Hensen and the fall of Arbel.  For such foesome speed must we account, lest we suffer too-soon again another crisis never seen in centuries past.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This was but the prelude, simply put.  Not soon would this mad tide recede.  Or perhaps, its waters were already at our feet.  Perhaps we were none the wiser, oblivious to the flood now rising to engulf us all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A flood by the name of “strife”.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">An era to scar our history.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Of one seed do we know that has quickened into this foul growth: <i>treachery,”</i> the chancellor spoke emphatically.  “A Londosian soldier; Balasthea’s acting commandant himself; a Man who has full-fraternised with the Nafílim.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Astonishment swept through the forgathered.  In truth, we’d all been apprised of a likely treacher behind this chaos, yet of the Orderly knights here, ‘twas only Felicia and I who were privy to the chancellor’s last detail  Indeed, never could any of the others have imagined so complete a betrayal.  To turn against Man, to walk with the Nafílim—the mere thought twisted their faces in disbelief.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">An inkling was in me, wishing that I were amongst that collective astonishment, for uncertainty seemed then a comforting veil from so haunting a reality.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Eldest son he is, and cadet to a baron-house,” the chancellor continued, almost spitting.  “And now, a wolven withersake withal—one by the name of <i>Rolf Buckmann.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The assembled’s unease was riled at once.  Though my three fellow mareschals sustained their composure as they stayed sat in deep thought, the same could hardly be said for the great many of our subordinates, whose indignance whipped the air itself into a bluster.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Rolf the wretch!  I know his stench!  The filth of the 5th!  The ungraced himself!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ah!  The pieces fit, then!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“He would spurn all of Man, is it!?  All because our Deiva has spurned <i>him!?</i>  How rotted be this rebel!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘That miserable malefactor’, ‘let justice stab him full-through’;</i> biting words, writhing into our ears, one after another.  Amidst the tumult, Cromheim began his own words—quietly, as though the crowd were never there at all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What of proof?” he propounded.  “Have we any?  Some token that tells true the treachery of this Rolf Buckmann?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">At once, the incensed leadership were becalmed.  A pause, and the chancellor gave an answer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“We have, indeed.  ‘Living proof’, as it were, here in the flesh: his blood-sister, against whom he has brandished arms,” he said, before turning his eyes my way.  “Mareschal Valenius.  Her account, if you will.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">My stomach turned.  “&#8230;Yes, Excellency.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I looked to Felicia.  Tenseness invested her as she quivered with dread.  Never would I have dared drag her here in such a state, but ‘twas not a thing to be helped.  Only she could full-attest to her brother’s crime, and as a dame of Londosius, she was beholden to oblige.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How small she seemed.  Seeing her shrunken so, I could but recall fairer days faraway, when Felicia was yet little and toddled happily after her brother’s every step.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;And there was I forced unto retreat.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">So ended Felicia’s account, greyly told bit by bit.  In that entire span did her gaze remain half-fallen, whilst her hands were pressed into her lap, whitely clenched.  Myriad expressions coloured the faces of the knightly leadership as they gave her their collective ear.  Some seemed green with suspicion, others red with displeasure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">After a brief hush, one amongst them spoke.  “’Sundered spells’, you said.  How certain is this?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Very,” Felicia answered.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“We have taken testimony enough from witnesses of the treacher’s mettle,” the chancellor added.  “The Brigadier speaks true.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so was it known.  A thunderbolt of a fact, attested by many eyes: Rolf, seen cleaving through <i>palings,</i> cutting through <i>magicks.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I doubt not your account, Brigadier Buckmann, yet…” Cromheim asked carefully, “&#8230;your eyes deceived you not, I trust?  When they saw the Igniēns Ĭcendō, of all spells, severed and snuffed?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Yes,” Felicia answered again.  “They saw true.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Eyewitness testimony, a first-person account; slowly did the truth sink in as any remnant doubt faded.  The mareschals, the leadership, all fell silent for a long while, frozen in rumination.  But when a voice broke the quiet at last, it spoke of another matter entirely.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Well, certainly shall we set all thought upon this man and his new ‘friends’.  But one thing demands sooner clarity,” broached one of our subordinates.  “House Buckmann.  What shall be <i>their</i> fate?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A cascade of nods swept through the Order leadership.  Indeed, as justice ought be meted upon a withersake, so ought the fate of his associates, kin or no, be deliberated upon—mine included.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Irrelevant,” snapped Juholt.  “We meet upon matters of the <i>military,</i> let us not forget.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The mareschal had the right of it.  Domestic affairs deserved another day, not when the realm’s highest echelons were so gathered.  But the leadership were not so easily convinced.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yet we have here with us the very sister to that sicarius,” the dissenter resisted.  “So let us clear the air, I say, first and foremost; discuss the course of House Buckmann and all others familiar to the treacher.  Evil runs deep; we must uproot it whilst we can.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Assent crescendoed from all ‘round.  Felicia remained sat utterly still, lips pursed shut.  Before long, the commotion settled as all eyes turned to Her Highness, begging her voice in this matter.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yet deeper runneth the wisdom of our forebears,” she began, unhurried.  “My granduncle… our prior sovereign hath, in his time, pardoned the kindred of a patricidal conspirator.  Such precedent the former King then did enshrine, and so were stricken from the land all laws charging kin on grounds of association.”  With those words, the princess then turned her iron-sea eyes our way.  “As then, so today: a pardon, therefore, ought be given to the House of Buckmann.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Your Highness,” the chancellor started, giving scarce time for our relief.  “It is as you say.  Indeed, no such law is listed in our legislation.  No longer, anyhow.  Yet if I may, we must needs mistake not the absence of law for an absolving hand.  We reckon here flagrant rebellion against the realm; pardon even the <i>thought</i> of perfidy, and I fear we shall stoke the distaste of the noble houses.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The chancellor’s words were as a chill air hissing into our ears.  His reputation as a shrewd and callous politician was baring itself full afore us all.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That, we know well,” returned the princess.  “Hence shall the lord and lady of House Buckmann be confined to their estate, the governance whereof to be assumed by appointed consuls <i>pro tempore.</i>  Such shall be the full burden for the Buckmanns to bear, and aught heavier we shall not brook, for their house is to endure…” she declared, then turning to Felicia, “&#8230;and their daughter withal.  Hers is a strength certain to succour our future assays; dispensing with her now shall be but to our dear detriment.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“With all due respect, Your Highness, a bitter remedy bites the malady all the more mightily,” debated the chancellor.  “We lose little to swallow it here, for a blight does fester beneath the unwitting watch, does it not?  Let us search out the worms of sin, my Princess, and withal the soil that did give rise to such rot as <i>Rolf Buckmann.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">How doggedly he stood his ground, this chancellor, even aface the decree of Her Highness—an effort perhaps attempted purely to fulfil the expectation of his office.  Even still, none of what he’s said sat right with me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“How now, Lord Chancellor,” drummed Juholt’s voice.  “Too deep a dosage and even a remedy might prove a poison.  Why, set to wind your very words, and swiftly would you find yourself flocked by our more… <i>fanatic</i> fowl, who should like naught more than to upheave the whole of the 5th, all to peck out those ‘worms’ of yours.  For verily it was the 5th’s ‘sin’ to have sent the man to Ström firstly, was it not?  Nay, disturb not <i>that</i> nest, I say.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“My fellow Mareschal makes a fair point,” agreed Cromheim, before glancing my way.  “The Lady Emilie is a lioness invaluable to Londosius, and a lodestar besides to its folk, high and lowborn both.  The realm would plunge into uproar were this scandal sown against her regard.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;It would, indeed,” the chancellor relented at last.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Naught more of this matter was heard from him on this council, and as his was the most prominent voice of dissent, so, too, were all other malcontents silenced.  And with them, any mind that so saw criminality in past association with Rolf.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thus were Felicia and I pardoned.  As for her parents… their lot was not to be helped.  Truth be told, I paid them small concern, for by this time, they were scarce more than a lukewarm relation to me.  Certainly had they treated me gently during my years in the Buckmann barony, but never did I forgive nor forget their cold hand in disinheriting Rolf and annulling our betrothal.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Your understanding solaces us all, Excellency,” said Cromheim.  “Now, shall we delve into the crux of this council?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What ought be our answer to this new threat, how might the Nafílim be confronted and Rolf vanquished—such was the “crux” of which Cromheim spoke, and the one matter I dreaded most, far and above the potential charges against Felicia and myself.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Very well,” answered the chancellor.  “But to the quick of it, we shall bestir the Orders to stem this tide.  That much is certain.  Rolf Buckmann is a mark best caught alive… but we shall welcome his breathless body no less gladly.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I inly gasped.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In such circumstance as we were, the chancellor’s words ought not be strange to any ear.  Yet to mine, they were as a stab to the belly.  Rolf’s “breathless body”—the mere sound of those words chilled all the blood in my own.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yes, <i>caught!</i>  And given to the gallows!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Slip the smallfolk upon him, why not!  Let him savour a good stoning!  That he might sore-rue every sin of his committal!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The hubris of this heretic!  Whip him till he whimpers like the whelp that he is!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Now were the leaders more raucous than before.  My subordinates, too, were joined in the commotion, as though Rolf were to them no less a stranger.  On and on they lashed themselves to greater frenzy, spewing words I wished never to hear.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet how familiar it seemed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The hearing from months ago.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In remembering it, I saw again Rolf standing alone in a storm of spite.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…A storm he’s endured for five long years.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yet who would sooner whimper?  The rebel?  Or you rabble?”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Ringing clear through the air now was a voice, bell-like and pristine.  A voice hitherto unlet during this entire council.  All attention followed it to its source, sighting first undulating locks of lavender—and eyes keener than any blade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There was she sat, unmoved by the sudden scrutiny: Estelle Tiselius, Dame Mareschal to the 1st.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;‘Rabble’ might ruffle one feather too many, mademoiselle,” remarked a leader sat anear Tiselius.  Though his words expressed displeasure for his mistress, the tone behind them seemed tepid with resignation.  All the other leaders shared in his futility, unable to rebuke the mareschal even as many of their faces were twisted with annoyance.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For how could they?  Tiselius was the finest blade in all the realm, never to abide an out-of-hand scolding.  Not least from myself, for although the both of us were hero-dames, from her portance alone did I measure her far more worthy of the title.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But met with the sewn lips of the Orderly knights, the chancellor frowned as he then aired their unease.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“How now, fair Mareschal,” he said, his voice a stony echo.  “An explanation is well in order, I should think.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Explanation, Excellency?” asked Tiselius, cocking her head.  “‘Strong be our foe’.  Might that suffice?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Strong enough to earn even <i>your</i> fear, I gather?” the chancellor began disputing.  “Need I remind you that he is a man unmagicked?  A waif unworthy of <i>Her</i> strength?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Need I remind <i>you,</i> Excellency, of the words spoken mere moments ago?” the hero-dame softly returned.  “That ‘unmagicked’ man vied with the best magicks of our brigadier—and won.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>—Ggkkhrr.</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Jolting back: a chair.  Standing asudden: another Orderly knight, fuming at the cheeks.  “Mareschal Tiselius!” he cried.  “With all due respect, I cannot for the life of me share your fear of that foundling ungraced!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Aye to that,” agreed yet another leader.  “And what of that weapon of his?  Reports reveal little of its nature, and we can guess even less.  But one thing sticks true: that black blade of his is but a <i>borrowed power.</i>  What might it prove against so mighty a grace as Yoná’s?  Hmph!  <i>Naught,</i> I say!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Aha haha!” Tiselius laughed, earning baffled looks from the leadership, and especially from the knight who’d so gloated of our superiority.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You hear a jest in my conjecture, madame?” he asked, shrill and offended.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Jest?  Why yes.  Yes, I do.  And naked mummery besides,” the hero-dame said.  “For ‘tis <i>we</i> who brandish a borrowed power, is it not?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Upon my word…!” so riled the leaders, but no sooner did they then fall into a hush afore the pressing aura of the 1st’s mareschal, their faces sallowing from the ire congesting in their veins.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“His</i> borrowed power trounces <i>ours,”</i> Tiselius asserted, “leaving us to fight back with naught but fist and foot—and to quail in confounded counsel as we do now.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In the course of her words was Tiselius most serene, her hands gingerly clasped upon the high table, her smile gently glowing upon her mien.  And after glancing through the speechless leaders, she spoke again, lightly, but lowly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hm.  <i>Jest,</i> indeed.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Mareschal Tiselius!” the chancellor thundered.  “Have it clear!  For whom is <i>your</i> borrowed power brandished!?”  The lord’s voice, frayed with hoarseness—’twas rather jarring to see him so heated, as ever did he carry himself with measured patience.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Why, for Londosius, of course,” Tiselius answered.  “As should any knight of this realm.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then act the part, will you!?” the chancellor barked.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Part’?  Is making light of an opponent the part of a proud Londosian knight?” Tiselius rebutted.  “My dear Excellency, I but warn against gauging a foe more frail than he is.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This none could argue.  And indeed, none chanced it.  The indignance of some amongst our leaders was such that they boiled in their seats, grinding their teeth and baring in full their animosity.  Tiselius surely perceived the sight, but continued on as though it were but a passing breeze.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Back to the straight, shall we?” she proposed.  “To begin with, Balasthea was dealt a delivering hand by none other than this Rolf Buckmann.  ‘Acting Commandant’—the day he assumed that very post was the day the sluice of victory was lifted.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This, too, none debated.  For to do so was to speak against the piles of reports attesting to this nigh-miracle.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But come the day he flew a different flag did that sluice fall shut,” Tiselius went on.  “Londosian might: <i>routed</i> at Hensen, <i>humiliated</i> at Balasthea.  And now above all, <i>broken</i> at Arbel and <i>bereft</i> of Ström.  Oh, how dread, indeed, the hand that mans the sluice.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Like silk was her expression, her demeanour a portrait, her voice a melody.  And yet was there an awe to Tiselius, looming and inimitable.  Any here who had a mind for dissent well-felt this pressure, and looked silently upon the mareschal as a sailor looks upon black clouds towering over a yet-calm sea.  Indeed, none dared stir as the hero-dame continued.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And so are we settled on the keenness of Rolf Buckmann’s ken.  But what of his mettle?  His own might?  Well, beyond any doubt, ‘tis a dear blunder to deem that black blade of his the only peril worth our worry.  For dogged practice has honed its wielder to a wonder of deftness, that even could the Kōkūtós be cloven by him, the Igniēns Ĭcendō <i>sundered.</i>  Fellow sword-devout as I am, I say this: still the tongue that scoffs his skill, lest he mark you another ‘magick’ to be <i>unmade.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">All of this.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Aught and all of this did I myself wish to declare.  That Rolf Buckmann is a man of amazement, a marvel of myriad valour.  Oh, how long I’ve yearned to reveal such worth to the world, for more than any other did I know of it, and just the same, rued that it should remain so reviled a secret.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet… yet on this day was I overtaken.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For ‘twas by Tiselius’ lips that Rolf was heeded at last.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…By lips that were none of mine.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What bitterness I knew then.  For uncountable were the occasions when I proclaimed Rolf the better of us all, that much debt did we owe to his courage and counsel.  Yet none in either Order or Central deigned to lend any ear.  No matter how loudly I lauded him, how incessantly I insisted of him.  No; Tallien, the Owlcranes, all of them—the one whom they championed instead was myself.  As I was his superior and he my swain, so should Rolf’s valour be as mine.  Such was ever their argument.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Even after my promotion to mareschal did I persist.  Whether it be suing for his rightful investiture, mandating against discrimination meted upon him, these and more I had endeavoured with all authority available to me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Indeed, never did I abandon him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Yet…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">On and on, I went unheard.  On and on, Rolf suffered.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so, sat here as I was, in the citadel of Redelberne, in the very beating heart of the realm, I could not help but feel inferior as the Crown, the Cabinet, and the lions of Londosius heeded the hero-dame’s every word and could bear no fang against them.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Why, the Östbergs themselves fell in like fashion,” Tiselius reckoned.  “Wager on it; your purse shall fatten with profit, I assure you.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Th-the Östbergs…!” stammered a leader.  “On what basis stands your claim…!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“My <i>ken,”</i> was Tiselius’ reply, terse, yet more steeled than any armour… and more keen than any dagger, as in hearing it, my very heart felt smarted by some edge.  For ‘twas <i>my</i> ken that knew more of Rolf than any other.  As it should.  As it… should…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Stamp and scoff as you like,” Tiselius said, “but the fool who baulks the fury of Rolf Buckmann merely speeds the mercy stroke unto Londosius’s nape.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Kh… nng…!”</i> so grumbled many of our leaders.  They were all of them accomplished personages of the Order, knights and dames whose portraits could hang along royal walls without shame.  And thus to be chastened so nakedly must be a first for them, not least afore so illustrious an audience as Her Highness, who watched on with all stoicism.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Your point is made well enough, Mareschal,” the chancellor said, grimacing.  “But think next to soften its sting, will you?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Why, I’ve blunted the barb as best I could, Excellency,” returned Tiselius with a light gesture.  “The Buckmanns themselves suffered a sharper sting, you ought know, when I met them on this selfsame matter.  Indeed, I very well left the lord and lady a little too sore, though it shames me to say.  But today ought find me better behaved, wouldn’t you agree?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That, the jury yet debates, I’m afraid,” the chancellor quipped.  “Though grim seems the verdict; <i>‘jest’,</i> Mareschal?  <i>‘Fool’?</i>  You would do well to watch your words, at the very least.  Such vitriol ill-becomes you.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Apologies, Chancellor,” Tiselius said passingly, before looking through the rest of us along the high table.  “Now, then.  What say my fellow Mareschals?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The spotlight shifted asudden.  Long distracted as I was, I could but inly fluster as I scrambled together a response.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I am agreed,” Cromheim answered first.  “If a wolf prowls the pasture, why, we ought slip every hound and hunter upon it, no?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“For my part…” Juholt carefully spoke next.  “Yes.  We should indeed watch this wolf closely—just as we should shiver <i>not</i> in our boots.  Stolid caution is but cowardice under cloak.   No; we brace… and <i>strike.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With all the other mareschals spoken for, I felt then every eye in the great hall converge upon me.  The weight of it could very well sink a ship, yet even then I managed to move my lips.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Rolf…” I began, “&#8230;Rolf Buckmann is a man brilliant in both book and blade.  A warrior wealthy of wit and wide of sight, he wields a will of steel.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Seized at long last: a chance to tell of Rolf, and not afore indifferent souls as before, but the very eminences of Londosius themselves, not least the princess and the other mareschals.  Would that this circumstance were different.  That beside me sat Rolf, rightly renowned and decorated with all he is due, to be knighted on this day to the full pleasure of both Crown and Kingdom.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But nay.  Today found me lauding him instead as…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;An ‘element’ to be reckoned with,” I slowly said.  “Such excellence… makes this of him.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Enemy”—the one word perhaps every ear had expected from my lips.  And yet, ‘twas a word I dared not air… not in describing Rolf, no.  But then did I sense Her Highness searching my eyes.  Her leaden-diamond regard, reaching deep down to decipher what inner strife might’ve shaped my answer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I could but endure the scrutiny, till at last was it broken as the princess turned next to the hero-dame.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Our Lady of Tiselius,” Her Highness broached.  “Thinkest thou vengeance be this man’s bent?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Perhaps a question best left to another lady, Your Highness,” answered Tiselius.  “One such as the Mareschal Valenius: former superior to Rolf Buckmann… and his once-sworn <i>fiancée.”</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Words, pricking like thorns beneath a rose.  A tone wringing me taut, as though to tease out of me an answer to a question long unattended:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>What’ve you been doing this entire time?  Fiancée that you were?</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Lady Emilie?”  The princess’ voice struck like a tolling of a bell.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;I think not, Your Highness,” I replied carefully.  “Vengeance veers too far from his compass.  I should guess his purpose lies elsewhere.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">That much I could vouch for.  Through all the winters of our intimacy, never had I witnessed Rolf moved by aught as frivolous as vindictiveness.  Not even during his time in the Order, when any lesser man might’ve given in to rancour and struck back at his offenders.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Offenders, much like one leader in this great hall, whose snorting at my answer stained the air.  As for the princess, she but placed a hand upon her chin and pondered deeply of my words.  To her side, the chancellor looked to us all and raised his voice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Now do we know our enemy,” he said.  “Let us hence chart our course against him and his host.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“To the viscounty of Tallien shall we dispatch the Order,” Her Highness then declared.  “Our Lady of Valenius.  Mightst thou and thy knights take up this task?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A request made with eyes firmly upon me again.  But in truth, ‘twas more a command.  A command to strike down Rolf.  A command to prove my loyalty.  Just the thought of it twisted knots in my stomach… but there was nothing for it.  The princess’ command was not to be disobeyed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The Lord Bartt Tallien was himself mareschal to the 5th Order; thou oughtst know him well enough, yes?” Her Highness pressed, sensing my silence.  “Such acquaintance may succour.  But moreover, with thy number was Rolf Buckmann most intimate; what better Order for the task, then, besides the 5th?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Tis… as you say, Highness,” I relented slowly.  “The task shall be ours, if you so command.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Here in this great hall, on occasion of this urgent council, was the princess invested with the prerogative of her father, the king of Londosius.  And so was her word His Majesty’s, and His Majesty’s the will of the realm itself.  Aface such royal imperative could I but oblige.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Just as powerlessness was beginning to numb my very thoughts, there resounded next a voice heard now for the first time.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Your Royal Highness, Princess Serafina.  If I may so humbly speak.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Whence did those words come than from right beside me; the voice of Sir Edgar, the newly appointed Chief Adjutant to the 5th Order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You…” Her Highness said, scarce above a whisper, “&#8230;thou art… Bailon—Sir Edgar Bailon, yes?  Pray speak at thy liking.  We are met here for counsel; if thou givest, so shall we lend ear.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You are most gracious, Highness,” my adjutant bowed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">An upright man, this Sir Edgar.  He wore his forty and some winters on his crown of grey-speckled hair.  If memory serves, his précis listed six years of service in the 4th, as well as a long-spanning tenure in Central thereafter.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“As the Mareschal Valenius’ chief adjutant, it is with regret that I measure our knights of the 5th ill-advantaged in this operation,” he stated clearly, before turning a glance my way, as though to beg leave in continuing on.  I nodded.  “Like as not…” he started again, “&#8230;our foes, the endemic Víly, shall soon make of their victory a token in persuading alliance from the neighbouring Nafílim.”  A most probable development, one earning audible agreement from Juholt himself.  “In such case, meagrest of the Orders as we are, I fear our number would march to their unmaking, needless as it is certain.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Five years past, when Rolf and I were yet sproutlings in the Order… ‘twas then that he offered me this key counsel:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Strategy is the stroke of a brush…  Tactics, the swing of a sword…’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Words that rang like a prophecy in our battles together, but much more so for the virtues of the former.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Ten moves decide the day… yet only two are played on the battlefield…’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">By his reasoning, then, we the 5th ought refuse this battle, if even before the march do we deem ourselves ill-steeled for the jaunt and joust.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And such accounts not another rub: distance,” Bailon continued.  “To wit, the span betwixt headquarters and battlefield both.  Suffice it to say, the 5th’s home at Norden is much too far from Tallien.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He had the right of it.  Norden straddled the royal capital, whilst the viscounty of Tallien was situated where else but anear a far march of the realm.  None could doubt that indeed a vast expanse laid between the two territories.  Why, ‘twas a week’s time that Felicia herself had spent to reach the western fringeland of Ström, neighbour to Tallien—and by carriage, no less.  What languor would await an entire Order, then, were they to march afoot?  Much the same as our expedition to the Erbelde three years past, surely…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“As per today’s proceedings, we now know our foes to be shrewd in strategy.  No doubt they shall bring to bear a fatal brunt upon any force so fatigued by a long march,” concluded Bailon.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Thy reason resoundeth,” Her Highness conceded.  “A closer Order should prove meter for our purposes; such be thy thought, Sir Edgar?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Precisely so, Princess,” Bailon nodded.  “But preciser still: Your Highness’ observation, for indeed amongst us the humble 5th are those quite acquainted with the Viscount Tallien and our dear rebel.  Much momentum might such associates confer to the thrust of this operation.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Mm…  Facility and familiarity; two swords swung as one, and with nary a need to send a force in full,” the princess summarised.  “What thinkest thou of this, Lady of Valenius?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;I am agreed, Highness,” I said, pressed by her gaze.  “By your royal command, I shall send at the soonest an associate most available.  Mayhaps one amongst my Owlcranes shall best serve.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To this, Her Highness nodded in consent.  Gerd, Raakel, Sheila—whom should be tasked was a decision for another hour, as this one found me yet too occupied with fraught thoughts of Rolf.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Now, as to the Order destined for Tallien—Lord Hugo?” said the princess.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yes, Highness,” answered the chancellor.  “If closeness be the main criterion, I should measure the 2nd Order most mete for the task.  Only…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Only, they are much preoccupied at present,” Her Highness finished for him.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Currently were the lands about the 2nd… insecure, to say the least.  What’s more, there was growing concern that the Víly’s triumph might galvanise Nafílim hostility.  For the 2nd to now march from their post, then, would be to leave their home as a babe in the woods.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“My dearest apologies, Highness,” Cromheim bowed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“It is an ill-helped matter,” said the princess.  “But if not the 2nd…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then we the 3rd,” answered Juholt.  A subtle smirk was on his lips, and in his eyes, the glint of confidence.  No objections were aired… ‘twas decided, then.  The 3rd Order would march to Tallien, and there face the Nafílim threat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sir Matthias Juholt—a knight of unchallenged surety, a tree fortress-like, whose very shade is as a shield against all peril.  A shield soon to meet Rolf’s sword…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so were the pieces chosen, the board set.  Though I was left with nary a breath of relief in my lungs, at the very least, I felt some weight lifted from my shoulders, to know that this ill council was nearing its end…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“If I may.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…or so I thought.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Sir Erik,” the princess confirmed.  “Speak.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Erik Lindell, Knight Lieutenant to the Owlcranes of the 1st.  Verily had he presented himself afore me as an aspirant to the post of chief adjutant not long ago.  That Bailon was sat beside me now should tell well of my decision in that matter.  And just the same, that Lindell himself was yet amidst the 1st’s retinue should tell of his end.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“This humble knight has known the viscount for many winters,” Lindell revealed with a bow.  “We are as brothers, I daresay.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oh,” the chancellor muttered, as though recalling for himself the same fact.  “Indeed, you have both got such a bond, haven’t you?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;Erik and I are well-acquainted…’</i>—the words of Tallien himself, sure enough, uttered on the final night of our march to the Erbelde.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ever has the Lord Bartt treated me with much cheer and charity; if he should be destined for dire straits, so should I like to lend my oar and deliver him from such danger,” said Lindell.  “Your Royal Highness.  Pray, grant me leave to be by his side in this terrible time.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“We see no need to prevent such valour,” answered the princess.  “So be it.  Leave shall be thine—if given as well by thy fair Mareschal.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Tis so, Highness,” nodded Tiselius.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thus ended the exchange.  Much violence had Lindell once wrought upon Rolf; that the two might meet again upon the battlefield stirred no small boding in me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then are we decided,” said the princess.  “Riding to Tallien shall be Sir Matthias Juholt and his knights of the 3rd Order, there to smite the Nafílim menace.  Joining them shall be Sir Erik Lindell, to lead and succour at need.  Whilst from the 5th shall be dispatched an officer of the Lady Emilie Valenius’ bidding, to serve as associate adviser to the Viscount Tallien and bane to the rebel, Rolf Buckmann,” Her Highness summarised at length.  “This council is adjourned.  Godspeed, ye knights, and may Her grace guideth you true.  Long live Londosius.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The great hall thundered as we stood at once from our seats.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Long live Londosius!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A salute in unison, and a sendoff to the grimmest council in all my time in the Order.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Forgive me, madame,” said Bailon with a slight bow.  We were headed back to the royal inn.  The air was heavy inside the driving carriage.  Twilight blazed through the windows; the day had been long.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Tis all right,” I said, shaking my head.  Like as not, my adjutant yet felt it a transgression to have counselled Her Highness without my prior consent.  “I never had the spirit for this operation, at any rate.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas the bare truth.  Why, if aught, <i>I</i> should be thanking him, really, as for the time being, it meant not having to cross arms with Rolf.  Yet the alternative gave little relief, for ‘twas Juholt and the 3rd who would march in our place.  Just the idea of it had my heart on the tenters.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What I ought say, what I ought do from hereon out… I knew not.  Not at all.  Down the royal avenue we drave, yet amidst all the motion, I felt myself at a strange standstill, trapped in a circle of thoughts.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Pardon, Sir Edgar,” Felicia said.  “Has aught come concerning the horse?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Her voice sounded strained, as though wrung out of much brooding.  Nay… not “as though”; she truly had been brooding, lost in reflection for days on end.  She’d fought her dear brother, after all… and returned with a wound from his blade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…What has become of our world?  <i>What?</i>  How blissful we were, till not more than five winters past.  Our many springs beside the ravines, our summers upon the meadows, our falls under the foliage.  Was it all but a dream?  More and more, it seemed so.  More and more, I felt left behind by all the change, by all the haste about me.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Rolf trouncing magicks, his bitter bane—a cause for celebration, if true.  And naught short of a miracle, even for a marvel as he.  Yet… hardly inconceivable, knowing him.  Oh, would he were here today.  I should like to congratulate him, and rain upon him all the praise and merriment as my voice and vigour would allow.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But he wasn’t.  And neither could he be.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For he’s turned his back to the realm, brandished his sword against his own sister, and declared to her his full foeship.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What was his mind?  Truly?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Very much did I wish to meet him.  To share words.  To understand at last.  Yet, just the same… just the same was I afraid to do so.  Horribly, horribly afraid.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And so did Bailon earn my thanks.  Not for a while, at least, must the 5th march against one of their former own.  Escapism, I know.  But nevertheless, I was grateful for this borrowed time.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Waging battle against Rolf… never must such a reckoning come to pass.  But should it… I feel my heart would be broken forevermore.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The inquiry proceeds,” Bailon answered Felicia.  “However, it has been months since the incident; as yet, we’ve uncovered no clue as to the hand behind the horse’s disappearance…  My deepest apologies, Brigadier.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nay, I ought apologise, as well,” Felicia returned, shoulders sinking.  “Already I’ve troubled you much on this matter…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">‘Twas not more than a week ago when Felicia had returned.  But after she’d given her report, our meeting did not end there.  No, there in the privacy of my chamber, I then gave her a report of my own: Maria’s story.  And therefore, the innocence of her dear brother and the injustice that was his exile.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">I remember well Felicia’s state when all was told.  She but remained sat, still as stone, her eyes lost of all light as they seemed to gaze away at some ghost.  And no matter how much I called to her, no answer came… save the tremblings upon her lips, through which passed whispers beyond all hearing.  Moments of this silence dragged on, till ‘twas broken at last by a slow turn of her head.  To me she looked, and with a shadow deepening in the fathoms of her eyes, asked me thus:</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i>‘&#8230;Then… then who…?<br />
&#8230;Who was it that set the horse loose…?’</i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Thereafter I relaunched an inquiry into this very matter, with Bailon at the helm.  He seemed most appropriate for the effort on account of impartiality, given that not yet was he a presence in the 5th at the time of the incident.  And from then on has Felicia, at every arisen opportunity, been pressing Bailon for even the slightest development.  And seeing her so desperate, a thought grew in me: should the day ever come when the truth is given to her…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…what would she do?</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such a question I had yet the courage to ask.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">The 5th headquarters.  In a leaders’ lounge were they sat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Fair of face and combed of corn-gold hair: Gerd Kranz, the spellblade.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With sinews like a sculpture and locks like a blaze: Raakel Nyholm, warrior of magicks.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And the buxom beauty belied by a smile innocent and serene: Sheila Larsen, the surgien.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Night was fallen.  With their duties done, the Owlcranes had flocked for some respite before retiring for the day.  The moment found them in the midst of merriment: a game of tarot and a bottle of spirits besides to milden the mood.  And what a fine spirit it was: golden like a late-summer sunset, the liquor listed lazily in tinnen cups of fine, inlaid filigree.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Such a lovely thing that meets my lips,” Sheila remarked, letting down her cup upon the table.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“You like?” said Gerd, taking a sip himself before studying the drink.  <i>“‘Uisce beatha’</i> they call it.  A barley spirit—and all the rage in Redelberne, of late.”  The lounge was lit little, and so as he mused, soft yet deep-set shadows played upon the spellblade’s face.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Well, it wafts nice to me nose, it does, but…” Raakel returned, “&#8230;it’s a mite priggish-like ‘pon the palate, if ye pardon me meanin’.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Gerd smirked.  “‘Ain’t in a tankard, ain’t to me taste’, is it?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Peh,”</i> Raakel sputtered.  “Never said it ain’t.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Booze ought be swigged than sipped, was Raakel’s motto, and so never could the lustrous liquid have earned her love.  Gerd and Sheila, for their part, quite enjoyed the drink, if their dainty delighting in served any sign.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“My dear Miss Raakel,” Sheila began with pity, “no banquet would deign to serve the alehouse fare you so fancy.  And yet banquets are your favourite occasion, are they not?  Acquiring a taste or two ought do you a fine favour there.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yea?  Well ‘ere’s a taste fer ye to acquire, <i>Miss Sheila,”</i> Raakel quipped, before slapping down a card upon the table: <i>Cornū Sōlis,</i> the Horn of the Sun.  And true to its name, it heralded the loss of Sheila’s every jeton.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oh, no!” the surgien gasped.  “How cruel!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Aye,” Gerd sighed, watching the warrior giddily gather up her boon of tokens.  “The fates’ve found their pet for the night, eh?  How long’s her lead over you now, Sheila?  Two?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Three, soon,” Raakel sooner answered, smiling at her new horde.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Of the trio, Gerd had the greater gift for the game, and so could not help but raise a brow at Raakel’s triumphant streak.  A seldom sight, truly, one stunning the surgien no less.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What shame…” Sheila sighed, “&#8230;though mine ought be the better brain for this.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ey!  I’ll belt ‘em brains out, I will,” Raakel snapped, raising her hand, but then deciding instead to flex the arm.  <i>“Brawn</i>—thass the winnin’ secret ‘ere!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“At this rate, she might be onto something, Sheila,” Gerd remarked.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Such banter continued, and more and more of the booze they imbibed.  Even Raakel, though at first misliking the stuff, eventually found it fair upon her tongue.  Perhaps the spice of victory had much to do with it.  Indeed, as her winnings waxed, so did the smile upon her lips as she slurped down the sumptuous spirit.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Well now,” said Sheila, “any word yet from Miss Emilie?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Raakel’s mirth vanished.  “Oi, come on,” she grumbled.  “Leave work fer the morrow, aye?  Merrymakin’s what’s on the menu tonight—an’ the wine o’ winnin’!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Stole the words right from my mouth,” Gerd said to Raakel, but then turned to Sheila.  “&#8230;All’s quiet as yet.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Long on their minds was Emilie, who at this moment was summoned to the royal capital.  Though such a trip was hardly seldom, something was amiss this time around: grim seemed the summons given, and just as grimly answered.  As part of the Order leadership, the three Owlcranes could but sense some darkness was afoot.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Balasthea’s done in real, innit?” Raakel broached.  “Pity.  It were winnin’ left an’ right, the fort.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I worry more for our dear mareschal, truth be told,” said Sheila.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Aye to that,” Gerd echoed, quiet.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">It had not been so long since the stronghold of Balasthea was brought to its knees.  But when tidings of it had reached Emilie’s ears, what warmth and sunniness that yet remained in her mien were lost all at once.  And to the Owlcranes’ keen eyes, not since then has she regained either of them, for posted to that selfsame stronghold was none other than her former fiancé.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A post of punishment, imparted by whose hand but Emilie’s very own.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nevertheless, our little swain is like to have left this coil,” reckoned Sheila, “&#8230;and with him, the chains fettering Miss Emilie, I should hope.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Who’s to say…” murmured Gerd.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oh?” Sheila blinked at him.  “Think you Miss Emilie yet yearns for her old flame?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hm?  Nay, it’s not that,” answered Gerd, half-startled, but after a moment’s thought, “&#8230;no.  Pay me no mind.”  He looked down at his cup again and stared into the amber reflections within.  Before long, his lips slowly parted once more.  “There’s the brigadier, as well,” he said.  “The Lady Felicia—she earns my other worry.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Aye.  The li’l lass look’d right fray’d-like, innit?” Raakel concurred.  And indeed, the daughter of House Buckmann had seemed mired—morose, even, following her return from Ström.  “Maybe she’s got a gander o’ the berk’s cold body?  He were her brother, sure ‘nough.  Must’ve left ‘er in pieces, the sight o’ him.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Perhaps so,” said Sheila.  “Our dear mareschal herself seemed quite fracted after Miss Felicia’s report.  Mm, curious…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Whichever the way, we’ll know for certain soon enough,” said Gerd, to which the other two nodded.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">What a storm of activity it was that had followed the brigadier’s report, soon after which found Emilie setting off asudden to Redelberne.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>‘&#8230;I-I’m sorry…’</i> she had said to the Owlcranes.  <i>‘&#8230;There’s too little that I can say… for now, at least…  But let us talk for sure upon my return…’</i></p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">This was an exigency, no doubt, if not yet could Emilie sooner discuss behind the walls of the Order than the chambers of Central.  There was, as well, the original summons, one set to address the fall of Balasthea.  But thereafter had something transpired that warranted an immediate council at the capital… one bidding the presence of Felicia.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">There was nothing for it; great wheels had been set in motion.  This Gerd prevised, for between the Owlcranes and their mareschal was stone-solid trust, that ever willing was the latter to discuss any matter on her mind.  Most ominous, then, was this speed, this silence.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Gerd let out a long, slow breath.  Undulating under dim light was his golden drink, in which drowned yet again his wordless stare.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I feel a bit frayed myself, to be frank,” Sheila confessed.  “Our little swain was a hulking heathen, that is certain.  And yet… yet I see much to be pitied about him.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I mislikes weak ones, I does,” said Raakel.  “Weak ones like the addle-pate ‘imself.  But if ye asks me: were he pit’ful, that alleyway pup?  Hm.  Aye, prob’ly.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Pity for the apostate; oh, indeed, were the two women airing something to that effect.  Their tongues were tinged with the usual scorn, of course, but to more acquainted ears, their tone might have sounded more softened, or sympathetic, even—perhaps by fault of the sodden hour.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>Were</i> he no heretic.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>Were</i> he a fellow knight, fast and valiant.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Another Owlcrane comrade to call their own.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Then…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Nay.  The fruitless thought was let be, for none of the three nurtured the same warmth of mind as Emilie’s.  Nevertheless, such thoughts, such fancies had, in truth, visited theirs on more than one past occasion.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Thinkin’ ‘bout it, that adjutant bus’ness—weren’t it just some front to bring the berk back?” Raakel guessed.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“So it seemed,” Gerd answered flatly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“But the bait ended up rotted on the snare,” continued Raakel.  “What were it whirlin’ in ‘is pate, I wonders?  Runnin’ an’ runnin’—thass all ‘e’s done, aye?  Maybe he thought it’d blow over meanwhiles?  The reek ‘e’s roused at the hearin’, that is.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Then alas: away from the snare and into the maw,” Sheila summarised.  “A shame.  Twenty winters lived—all for what?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">She sighed.  But no sooner did a knock then play upon the door.  Gerd bade the knocker enter.  In came a knight, who, declaring his bearing a message from the mareschal, handed to Gerd a scroll.  Taking it, the spellblade confirmed Emilie’s seal upon the parchment.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To the knight he then nodded.  “Dismissed,” he said, to which the knight obliged.  Privacy restored, Gerd next unsealed the scroll and scanned through the contents therein.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The silence stretched on, in which while Gerd’s regard grew grim.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A prank, innit?  Some love letter or summat?” Raakel jested, perhaps to lighten the air—and unravel the unreadable furrows upon Gerd’s brows.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">He scoffed.  “Nay.  A notice, Owlcranes,” Gerd said darkly.  “We’re to set out soon.  But as to the ‘where’ and ‘why’—that, Emilie would like to discuss after she’s returned.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“To take back Balasthea, I presume?” Sheila guessed, looking into her own cup.  “But Arbel has men in spades…  Why send for the Order, I wonder?”  She then ventured another sip, but halted as soon as a new thought sparked in her mind.  “…Nay… unless…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Unless’, indeed,” Gerd answered, setting down the scroll.  “If what’s writ here be true, then… forget Arbel—Ström itself is lost.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">The viscounty of Tallien.  West Londosius.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Beside a busy street stood a building, like an old and upright loaf of bread, encrusted in tired and dusty masonry.  Yet more to it there was than meets the eye, for this was the very guildhall to the mercenaries of this land.  And as one might imagine, the lion’s share of the patrons passing through its doors were of the roguish persuasion: rough at the edges and edged to the roots, to put it brightly.  There, coming out: a scowling brute, bald-pated and bristle-bearded.  Shoving him aside: another knave, with nary a shirt over his shoulders, as though to gloat of the gash-scar running across his bare, hulking bosom.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Mind not the ensuing brawl between them, and inside would one find the usual bustle, brimming with mercenaries on business and banter-making.  Though myriad were their miens, the soldiers-of-fortune all shared the same shimmer in their eyes, like the glint of a razor blade or the glare of a feline, livid and like to lash at any moment.  And lash they did, for as outside, so inside: scuffles and fisticuffs were had on the daily here, and today seemed no different.  Above the background of grunts, grumbles, and guffaws, there thundered voices virulent: two many-muscled men were at it, clutching each other’s collars and screaming into each other’s eyes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Spits that ‘gain an’ I’ll spits ya through to the ‘ilt, I will!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Not ‘fore I nips ya knickers-sniffin’ knob off!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The very air shuddered under their ire.  But as to the “why” of their wildness, none of the others in that parlour knew, nor had a particular care for even if they had done.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Save, that is, for one unenviable soul.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Gentles, gentles!” came a cry.  “Come, let’s be civil, shall we!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Common, certainly, were such commotions.  But this guild had an operation to run, and roughhousing was not to be suffered.  And so beside the two brutes appeared a young man, one of many clerks to this establishment, hopelessly hoping to halt the squabble.  A pity, then, that he went wholly unheeded, for the heat between the brutes only burgeoned from there on.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ya beggin’ for an’ early grave, <i>mate!”</i> screamed one.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Not as early as yours, <i>coz!”</i> screamed the other.  “When I spades it with that <i>splint</i> ya fancies a sword!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“N-n-n-no no no!” stammered the guild clerk.  “Not here, men!  No scraps, no scuffles, no spars on guild premises…!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The clerk then yelped asudden, for bared now between the firebrands were blades live and ready to let rip.  Alas, what was to be a usual dispute seemed tottering towards an unusual disaster.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Time t’dance, dung-licker!!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Lost were their marbles, these two, as was the colour on the clerk’s face as he blanched back from the bloody clash to come.  But just before things could boil over, stepping into the scene was a new figure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Time to sit, you mean.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Its words: soft, yet stern.  Its intervention: valiant, and yet ill-advised.  For these were brutes with bulging veins and volcanic blades; two bears in a bout, between whom none of right mind ought mingle.  Passing strange, then, that the selfsame bout stood now in silent suspension.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Indeed, with blades yet held aloft, the brutes turned to the intruding figure.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And felt upon their cheeks a chilling sweat.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“O… ofh…”</i> one gulped.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“M… mornin’ to ya, Frieda,” the other whispered ditheringly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The figure affrighting them was but a woman, slender and delicate, a twig afore the two bough-like brutes.  Yet she only sighed at them, and brushing aside her shoulder-length locks of amber, gave them both a hard look.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Mornin’,’ you say?” she echoed.  “Fancyin’ some blades for brekkie, I take it?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“N-no, ma’am…  We er… we gots a mite too ‘ot an’ ‘airy-like, we did.  Heh…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A-aye, that!  B-bad boys we is, <i>bad!</i>  This be, er, g-guild prem’ses!  Ain’t no place for swashbucklin’, oh no no!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The two then sheepishly apologised to this Frieda, all the while averting their eyes like two urchins caught amidst some mischief.  And once their blades were full-sheathed, the quivering clerk scrambled up beside Frieda with a most grateful gaze.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oh, bless you, Frieda!” he cried.  “You could not’ve come any sooner!  I was right ‘fraid we’d have ‘nother mash to mop up…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Think naught o’ it.  Now,” Frieda said, turning next to the hotheads, “what in heavens were you two cats croakin’ ‘bout?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ah…” the slightly braver brute began, “&#8230;eh, ahah!  It uh, er, we was ehm… i-it weren’t nothin’, really.  J-jus’ er… jus’ pickin’ ‘tween wot’s better!  A woman, wearin’ smalls or eh… the <i>wind…</i> as they says.  Heheh.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Handsome hills to die on,” Frieda quipped, squinting her eyes sharply before giving another sigh.  “A woman wears what she damn’d well wishes, an’ that’s that.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Yea!  Exact as me thinkin’!” the two answered in unison.  And then, yet blissfully unashamed and sweating down the ridges of their rugged faces, the brutes broke a simper and blathered on.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“S-so er… w-wot ‘bout you, eh Frieda?  You er…” one ventured, “&#8230;you wearin’ the wind?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Flyin’ free-like’s the fad ‘mongst maidens as yourself!” the other giggled.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Frieda stamped her foot.  “Blow that ‘wind’ any woman’s way ‘gain an’ I’ll have your heads ‘flyin’ free-like’, I will!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“S-s-s-sssorry, ma’am!” stuttered the left brute, pressing his palms together in prayer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I-it’s ‘igh time we shog’d, innit!” yelped the right.  “F-fair day to ya, Frieda!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">About-facing, the brutes sprang away, but no sooner did they make two strides than were they stopped full by Frieda’s voice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hold ‘em hamhocks,” she hissed at their backs.  “Don’t be thinkin’ I’m blind to the chinks an’ chips on your falchions.  Haven’t I told you a hundred times ‘fore?  A happy tool today—”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“—doubles the coin t’morrow!” the brutes yipped together.  Turning back to Frieda, they stood at attention, entirely sapped of all the ire raging only moments before.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Very good,” Frieda nodded.  “Now get yourselves to the smith’s, lest you like livin’ one chip ‘way from trouble, you hear?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Th-that we wills, ma’am!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“J-jus’ ease ‘em eyes o’ yours, can ya?  Else I sleeps bad t’night!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Sore from the scolding, the two men then bowed and quit the guildhall, the pathetic pucker on their faces scarce wearing off till many a stride down the street.  Yet without mistake, somewhere in their miens sang a tinge of mirth.  Frieda’s words had been as barbs upon their ears, sure, but deep down inside, the men understood very well that she would not have admonished them so if not for her genuine worry for their wellbeing.  Such was not lost to the surrounding sellswords, who, having witnessed the scene, returned to their businesses with warmth in their eyes.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">They were all of them quite fond of this Frieda, for she was, to them, a beacon lit by strength itself, inspiring and awe-sparking.  Yet in such light did they feel, too, the glow of her good and honest nature.  Theirs was a cruel, cutthroat industry, after all, and more or less did they deal with death on the daily.  And so for a fellow freelance like Frieda to show a sincere care for them was worth more than the finest coin or the fattest coffer.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oi,” whispered a sproutling of a sellsword sat in a corner.  “Who’s that bird?  She’s a proper belle if I’ve ever seen one.  Wot’s a man gots to do to spend a night with ‘er, ey?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px"><i>“Hemph.</i>  She’s out o’ your league, mate.  An’ even if she weren’t, I reckons you’ll spend the night on the barber’s table ‘fore ya spends a minute on ‘er bed, if ya catches me drift,” answered a veteran sat anear.  “Take a gander; ya makes a move on Frieda, ya makes an en’my out o’ all the gentles ya sees ‘ere.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Frieda was ever a force to be reckoned with, and withal a name heard by many ears.  But of late was she even more so: keener was her blade, and in the words of those with an eye for subtlety, she now showed more petals to her personhood, as it were.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">About half a year prior had the freelance been involved in an incident in another province.  To wit: the prosecution and arrest of the lord and son of House Albeck for the sin-steeped tragedies wrought deep in their manor.  The whole adventure seemed to have sparked some change in Frieda, for very soon after her return, she began plying herself with a fervour never before seen in all her years.  And so, as they say, the rest was history: with industry most diligent, Frieda earned merit after merit over the following moons, becoming an even brighter lodestar within her circles.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And as well, an object of adoration amongst her more… “lusty” colleagues, if their bawdy breaths were aught to go by.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Right then,” said the guild clerk, “what bus’ness’ve you got today, my good Frieda?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ah.  Remember the reek what’s been harryin’ the highstreet?  Well, thieves in the thick o’ night they were,” Frieda reported to him.  “Had ‘em all roped an’ rounded up easy-like, an’ now they’re brewin’ in the bailiffs’.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“The bailiffs’, you said?  Already?” the clerk returned with brows raised high.  <i>“Hwoh!</i>  Speedy as ever, eh Frieda!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A blush bloomed upon his face.  Hearing of Frieda’s triumphs, if even on the daily, seemed ever the delight of his day.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">But the freelance herself only sighed.  “They’ll be wantin&#8217; for gaol space, I’m ‘fraid: more worms to this wood than I’d like,” she continued with some concern.  “Remember, too, the ruffians lordin’ it over in doss-town?  Well, the ones I busted might’ve been lads from their lot, caught right in the middle o’ warmin’ up—to make ‘nother hold out o’ the highstreet someday.  Goodness knows how long they’ve been keen on it.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Ah.  The pieces do fit, I’ll give you that,” the clerk nodded.  “Duly noted, then.  The guild’ll have eyes on it, I assure you.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">With that, the clerk began scribbling intently upon a notebook from his pocket.  But upon finishing, he looked up, and there Frieda found in his eyes a rather disarming greyness.  After a quick glance about, the clerk leant close to her, and cupping his mouth, said:</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Frieda, have you heard tell?  The sky’s fallen—down on Ström, that is.”</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">─────────　♰　─────────</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p style="text-indent: 40px">The lightness in Frieda’s face, too, was now swiftly lost.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“I have,” she answered.  “It’s hard believin’, but I’ll hear your take, if you’ve got one.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A rumour had been roving about since the morrow of that day.  “Ström is destroy’d,” many said.  “Our neighbour—fallen to Nafílim fiends,” others added with a shudder.  Too grave for gossip this was, but though mirthless were the mouths that passed such tidings, the ears that heard them were yet hard-convinced.  Not that they could be blamed, for never in Londosius’ history had any of its lands been lost to the foe.  Still, such a precedent ill-soothed the serious look on the clerk’s face.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“That I do,” he whispered back.  “It’s real—and confirmed.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Confirm’d…” Frieda echoed, crossing her arms.  “Int’restin’ times we live in now, innit…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And we’re next, from the look of things,” the clerk said, nodding slowly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">To which Frieda frowned.  “Li’l wonder why the town’s on edge…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">War was at their doorstep; the thought had been embering in Frieda’s mind throughout the day ever since she had eavesdropped the first whispers, but to hear it now from the clerk himself left her voice quieted with unease.  Still, battle was her bread and butter, her very livelihood, and so, though quieted she may have been, her shoulders yielded not a shiver.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Bus’ness’ll be boomin’ for us, you reckon?” Frieda asked wryly, wondering now if the sword girt at her hip would someday be bidden to stay the tide.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Hmm… that I wonder,” said the clerk, thoughtfully holding his chin.  “The lord has got no love for our lot, after all.  Or so I’ve heard.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“And we, him,” Frieda returned.  No warmth was in her voice.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“We <i>and</i> the fiefsfolk,” nodded the clerk.  “But that ought be left on the down-low, if you get my meaning.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The clerk then forced a half-smile.  For her part, Frieda showed no change.  Prudence was her principle, for certain, as proven by her pacification of the prior squabble.  Yet such prudence dared not dip its toes into the tar-pit of utter pragmatism, that Frieda would be so fain to curry any favour from the more… <i>nefarious</i> sorts of Londosian society, even should they entice her much reward.  Hence why she took quite the dim view of the viscount of this land.  Indeed, he was, to her, a man of foul regard, a rapacious rakehell, one whom she hated with no hesitation.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Thing is, the lord’s something of a, erm… <i>pet</i> of Central, one could say,” the clerk whispered with shuddering shoulders.  True enough, the viscount had once served as mareschal to the Order, in which time he ventured not the lightest tug against Central’s leash.  No doubt, then, that between them ran pipes wide and unclogged, as it were.  “So like as not…” the clerk whispered on, “&#8230;the knights’ll be getting involved, and soon.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“From candle to conflagration,” Frieda remarked with a dusking look upon her face.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For whom and for what, the freelance knew not, but at the very least, half the answer was now made clear to her: her sword would, indeed, be made to strike.  Reason backed this little, for it was but a guess of the gut.  Yet Frieda lived by battle, and in such matters, no guess of hers was to be gainsaid.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Tell me,” she spoke again, “might there be more to this yarn?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“There is, but naught I can speak to yet,” answered the clerk.  “Though the inspectors over at Roland are putting together a report, meanwhiles.  Our guild ought be requesting some transcripts soon; I can save you one, if you’d like, Frieda.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Please, an’ thank you,” the freelance said before drawing a deep breath.  “Mighty swift, the Rolanders.  Impressive, really, if I’m honest.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Coin quickens a merchant more than it does a mercen’ry, I’m ‘fraid,” said the clerk, chuckling halfheartedly.  But not a moment sooner did heavy steps groan close.  There then appeared a different man, though “different” not in the fullest meaning, for this bloke seemed much like the two that had turned tail earlier: a scar darkened his cheek, whilst the rest of his body brimmed with throbbing thews.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Frieda!” he cried with a gaping grin and outstretched arms.  “Fancy meetin’ you ‘ere!  Oh—that trick ya teach’d me the other day.  Guess wot?  Got meself bit by some elderburs while in the weeds, I did, but your stuff—it work’d <i>wonders,</i> aye!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Frieda looked up, returning the smile.  “Got the bane out o’ you, has it?  Chuff’d to hear it.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“A-aye!” said the man, who then began scratching his hackles nervously.  “So ehr… I-I were thinkin’, ‘ow ‘bout a mug or two, ey?  On me!  As thanks-like!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Quickly, he pleaded with palms together, but the clap that sounded from them was as a thundercry, as many seats in the parlour were then struck aside and many more feet stamped asudden.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Oi, shog on out o’ ‘ere!” one voice vaulted above the new commotion.  “Frieda ain’t got no time for your tiny knob!”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Wot’s that!?” the man roared back.  “Crossin’ ‘tween me an’ the fair lady, ain’t ya!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A rush of muscles and motion, and soon were two men tussling again, clawing and catching each other’s collars, tugging and tottering this way and that.  Chairs tumbled, dust danced; with a gasp, the clerk fumbled forth to stop the new fight.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Frieda but sighed at the sight with a sidelong look and shrugged.  “A bunch o’ berks, them…” she muttered.  “When’s a more cultured cove ever goin’ to come ‘round, I wonder…”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And just as she aired those words, the image of a manful figure flickered in her mind.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">One she had met moons before in her flight from the Albeck manor.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-align: center">♰</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Flowers swayed afire under fair noonlight.  Countless colours listing to and fro, as frothed and flowed fountain waters down sun-dappled channels.  A gentle, eternal churning, bedight with chirps and cheers of little birds from their topiary perches and houses of hedges jutting high.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The splendour of Londosius, full-displayed in this royal garden of Redelberne.  Beneath the looming and illuminant palace, amidst manicured banks of brilliant blossoms and marble balustrades, there stood two figures.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">One was the princess herself: Serafina Demeter Londosius, with her gaze of graceful grey and locks of silver scintillating in the sun.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">And the other: a man in his seeming forties, with a face most infrequently found on the palace premises.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Well now,” he said, “how might this lowly yeoman serve Your Highness?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“‘Yeoman’?” the princess repeated, her pale and perfect back yet turned to the man.  “A rather humble term for so high a post as a mareschal’s hand…”  Whom was she addressing but the new adjutant to the Mareschal Valenius: Edgar Bailon.  Ostensibly an officer of Central for many winters, it was at the recently held royal council where he had made his presence full-known.  “Thy transfer, thine enterprise,” Serafina said on, “naught hath not gone unpried by <i>this</i> princess.  Pray thee, tell me this: what be it <i>now</i> that moveth thy mind?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“My mind?” Edgar began his benign answer.  “Why, my mind is merely to avail this new age—and its nascent hero-dame.”  Then with a bow, “And withal, Your Royal Highness and this holy realm of Londosius.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;So thou sayest,” Serafina murmured.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“My hope such words were to your satisfaction, Princess,” Edgar followed.  “But might that be all?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">In truth, his “hero-dame” was already homebound with her retinue.  It would be a short while yet before Edgar himself could follow her back to the 5th headquarters, as on this peculiar occasion, he had been singularly summoned by the princess, who now shook her head slightly.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“Nay,” she said.  “Another matter biddeth thee answer.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Edgar bowed again.  “Then answer, I shall.”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Serafina stood silent.  Seldomly did any emotion mar her doll-like features.  But turning at last to Edgar, such seldom emotion was now full-bare for his eyes to see.  Bright and brimming: the emotion that is “anger”.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“What ploy is it?” the princess asked sharply.  “That thou… that <i>you</i> play now?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“&#8230;Whatsoever might you mean, my Princess?” Edgar asked back, smooth and not in the least daunted.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">For a young woman as wise as she, Serafina’s question was indeed uncalled for.  Still, when Edgar gave his most expected answer, the princess could but cast her eyes down… and clutch at the pleats of her skirt.  Such was the strength in her trembling hands that the fine tinsel and satin very nearly squealed under her squeeze.  Then, as though bursting at the seams, Serafina flashed her face forth and bore down upon Edgar a livid glare.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">“How much longer!?” she cried.  “How much longer will you pretend the part of ‘Edgar Bailon’!?”</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">The veritable scream echoed under the cloudless sky.  Nearby birds all took wing, escaping the woe woven in the princess’ words. A long-mulled lament, all let upon this unassuming man, who answered with naught but silence and eyes coldly closed.  The lull endured.  Only wind and water dared any sound, till at last, Edgar lifted open his eyes…</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">…and smiled.</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">Soft and serene, a smile most beseeming of the sun and flowers all about.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p style="text-indent: 40px">A smile, affable… and fearsome.</p>
