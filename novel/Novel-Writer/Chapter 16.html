  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5">"Are you sure you're okay with this?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">We're in a world famous hamburger chain. I ask Rin that, who is across the table from me.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yep, it's all good. I've been craving teriyaki burgers for a while."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ah, you do love them."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin chews her burger with a big smile on her face. The way she's using both her hands to eat her burger, Rin looks like a chipmunk or something.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, you're eating a teriyaki burger too!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Why wouldn't I? They're the best!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"That's for sure."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin's pupils constrict, like she's remembering something from the past.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Coming back here, it's really taking me back."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I'm pretty sure the first restaurant we went to together was one of these."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah definitely."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin longingly stares at the burger in her hands.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"That was definitely... a little while after we first met."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, yeah. If I recall correctly, you were crying."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hey, you better forget that right now. What's your problem? You're bringing up embarrassing moments from the past to blackmail me into giving you this burger? That's a pretty new low, you know."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I definitely wouldn't stoop that low."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, this time I won't cry. Hmph”.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Hmph indeed.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You're cute, you know."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I unintentionally let out my inner thoughts. Rin starts to whimper and her face goes all red. She then puts her hand in front of her mouth. Yep, she's definitely cute.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"A-anyways, what did you think of the film?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, I think we share a general opinion about it."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">All of a sudden, we're enveloped in an embarrassing mood, so we shift the conversation towards another topic almost naturally. Since we're childhood, this kind of synchronization is pretty much par for the course.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What was your favorite scene Tohru-kun?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"For me, it really was the last scene. The way Monaka-kun was bent on delivering the ingredients across the railroad tracks for the person he loved really got to me."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ahh, for sure! I'm sure that scene will go down in history as one of the best scenes in anime."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"And what about your favorite scene?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Me? Hmm..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin trails off and looks up at the ceiling. After pausing to think for about ten seconds, she opens her mouth again.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hmm, there are a few good ones... but I have to agree, the scene with Monaka-kun was really the best one, it got me crying the most."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ah, I know what you mean. I just went 'Uaah' when those two were forced away from each other."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, definitely."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">With that Rin stares directly into my pupils.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hmm, something up Ri-”</p>

    <p class="calibre5">There’s something off about her stare.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Oh hey, what’s wrong?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ah, no... it's, well..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin starts rubbing her eyes, making herself more flustered in the process.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Y-you okay?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"S-sorry, it's just... a little bit of nostalgic tears."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Slender tears fall down her face as her eyes constantly blink, her chest is bound tightly too. It's those tears that trigger an innate response within me: I have to protect her no matter what. I want to pat and hug her right now, but I grit my teeth and bear the pain.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Haha... looks like I ended up crying."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Her torrent of emotions comes to a gradual stop, as she's laughing at herself.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Don't worry about me, these tears mean nothing at all. They’re just nostalgic tears."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, but you're crying."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin sharply turns her face away and her lips relax. She's acting childish again.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, it's fine. It happened at a good time anyways.”</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What do you mean?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You know, the most beautiful time to cry is when you're eating."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin's face is immediately washed with pure shock. However, that only lasts an instant. as her face turns red, her pupils constrict and a smile appears on her face.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Really... you haven’t changed at all Tohru-kun."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Huh, what do you mean?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin shakes her head in response.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Oh, it's nothing."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">All I can do is cock my head in confusion.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">And so, our date continues on like this, filled with our version of happiness.</p>
