  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5">"And here we are, probably the most unique room in the house."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You can just be honest and say it's a filthy room."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin gives me a harsh retort as I tidy up my room a bit. Rin came over on such short notice, that I didn't really have to prepare. Because of that, my room looks like any typical male student's room. That being said, it isn't that dirty where every square inch of the floor is covered, so it didn't take too long to tidy up.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It really hasn't changed at all."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin sits down on my bed and looks around. She's looking at all the toys we used to play with when we were kids.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well yeah, there really isn't much to change up to be honest."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I'm not in any sports nor do I have any other hobbies, which is why my room is pretty plain looking. Thereâ€™s really only one spot in my room that is unique to me.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ahh, I see you added one bookshelf though."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin points towards the three bookshelves in my room. The first one contains reference books for grammar, writing and what not along with dictionaries and thesauruses. The other two are packed with young adult fiction. White, red, green and blue labels are wrapped around the books, making the bookshelves look like a rainbow of colors.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"That's the best way to get the fundamentals into my head."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">From an outsider's perspective, all these books are evidence enough of my drive to become an author. I probably read way more than the average person if I do say so myself. I take a fleeting glance at Rin.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Wow, that's amazing."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin is singing my praises and I can feel a heavy pain in my chest.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It's... not that amazing."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I mutter that quietly, but it doesn't really matter if Rin hears or not.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"The charm."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I hear the shock in Rin's voice.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Tohru-kun, you still have that too?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">It was in grade three when Rin gave me the "Realization of one's dream" charm. I remember taking it out a few days ago. We both ended up hanging our charms on our desk light. As if the timing couldn't be more perfect, I could feel an itching pain inside my chest.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, it's a promise after all."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I try to hide my shaking and act as calm as humanly possible. Rin's voice sounds like someone is squeezing her chest.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I... see."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">From that single phrase, I could hear the evident sadness from her voice.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Why....?</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin doesn't seem like herself today. Thinking back, it isn't just today, Rin has been depressed for the past few days. Just as my gross statements have pretty much disappeared these days, Rin's sharp tongue is absent too.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">A strange sensation flutters around my chest as I finish cleaning up and take a seat beside Rin on my bed. The springs on the bed start to shake, having to support the weight of two people. Being in a room with another girl is embarrassing in and of itself, but we are basically 30 cm apart. While we are side by side, my mind is blanking because of my nerves and lack of sleep.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Tohru-kun."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin breaks the silence first, as she constantly picks at her sleeve. At the same time, we look at each other.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Huh..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">The rustling of clothes, that sweet smell and that soft sensation, all those things penetrate my brain; the distance between has practically become zero.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">As my thoughts are trying to catch up, I feel two arms around my back. It's a soft feeling, like I'm being hugged. For whatever reason, Rin has decided to hug me without warning.</p>
