    <p class="calibre5">"Fuguu... Eguu..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"And what did I say about raising red flags before?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">The movie finishes screening and Rin is sniffling like a kid after getting a vaccine as we leave the theatre. I take a look at some of the other people leaving the theatre, and there are some people crying here and there, but Rin's crying is definitely the most prominent.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"That... hic.... that scene... was so unfair... uguu..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hey, calm down. At least wipe up your tears."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Having said that, I hand Rin my handkerchief.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Th-thanks... a lot."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Like a cat combing itself, Rin begins to wipe her eyes dry. However, those glittering sparkles of emotions don't stop flowing out.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">...Have I mentioned just how damn cute she is? I'm so sorry Rin, but your crying face is one of the Seven Wonders of the world. She's usually so aloof and cool, but seeing her regal features like this, oozing out so much emotion, I just want to shield her from any dangers. My desire to stroke her increases and a need to hug her wells up inside me. There's nothing I can do but endure these growing impulses.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, it definitely was more a tear-jerked than I expected.‚Äù</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Uuu... Shinkai-sensei... really is the best..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Some time has passed and Rin has mostly calmed down. Her red eyes are similar to opening your eyes in salt water for a bit.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"...Thanks for giving me your handkerchief. I'll make sure to wash it and give it back to you later."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It's fine, it's just some cheap handkerchief."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You think I'm crazy!? If I give it back to you now, who knows what kind of messed up stuff you'd use it for."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Do you really think I'm that deranged!?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I retort back and Rin laughs it off jokingly. It makes me relieved that she isn't so down anymore. Her face is beaming.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"But I'll make sure to clean it before I give it back."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">There's no way Rin will back now, so I meekly concede to Rin's request. With nervous resolve, Rin speaks up again.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Thanks for today."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin gives me words of gratitude as we leave the building.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, it was a very interesting movie, if I do say so myself. I probably would have missed out on it if you didn't invite me."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Not only was it interesting, it's honestly a good reference point for a writer like me. The use of foreshadowing, the way the heroine conveys her words, it was all superb. There were so many times when I was watching that I caught myself saying "So that's it" because I was so caught up in everything. On a production level, there were so many things to enjoy about it, outside of pure enjoyment.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Is that so... Well, that's good to hear."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Hmm, something's up. Rin's acting all evasive and quiet. She's fidgeting around and acting all weird in general. I want to say something, but I just can't find the right words. But my intuition definitely feels something wrong. As her childhood friend, I know I have to do something, so I start whispering.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What's up?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hmm?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It seems like you want to say something."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin is taken aback by my question. After darting her eyes around, she puts her hand on her chest.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">She lets out a big sigh, acting all nervous about the whole situation.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It's around lunch time... I was thinking if you had some free time, maybe we could go get something to eat?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">She's asking me out for lunch. What an unexpected angle of attack, she definitely caught the enemy off guard.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ahh, it's about lunchtime now, isn't it. I definitely feel hungry."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">This isn't something she should be worried about.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"If you want to go, we can go. We don't have to if you want to go home after this."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">If I'm given the option to go home by myself or spend more time with the one I love, it's a no-brainer. If I do say so myself, it seems like Rin's expression is blooming. This change, it's like watching an urban nightscape with a double speed camera. A big, dumb smile appears on my face, as I feel my face getting hotter.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Al-alright, let's go then."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Sure."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Mmm..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I put out my hand as naturally as possible, which causes Rin's eyes to start darting around.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ah, sorry, my bad."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I made the same mistake again. In a panic, I begin to draw back my hand. However, Rin seizes my hand before I have a chance to withdraw my hand.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"...Eh?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I look at Rin's face, her regal features are dyed with bashfulness and joy.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Don't think about it too hard, I'm in a good mood right now... so... take it as a... treat..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Suddenly, Rin averts her gaze.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"...I see. Well, to keep your mood high, I'll make sure to keep holding your hand."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Don't get too carried away."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hya, sorry."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I give an exaggerated reaction and Rin breaks out in laughter. And then...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, anyways..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">With her other hand, she covers her mouth.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"If you ever want to hold hands again.. I'd be fine doing it..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">My happiness meter broke hearing those words and I unconsciously squeezed Rin's hand harder. Rin gives me surprised glance, as her mouth relaxes and she grasps back just as hard. It's as if Rin is saying she won't lose to me. With her palm against mine, I can feel the sensation of her smooth skin. For a moment, the feeling of her plan was seared into my brain so hard that I nearly lost sight of where I was going.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">We continue walking through town, hand in hand. On the way, a thought crosses me mind. Is it possible that Rin specifically chose this time to watch the movie so we could have lunch together?</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Why are you staring at me so much. You're giving me this creepy smile."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Okay, I might have had a gross smile, but I definitely wasn't staring."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin definitely isn't feeling the romantic vibe at all. Well, Rin did invite me to watch a movie and now we're going to eat lunch together, so there's that. I guess that's enough to keep my happy.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hmm, so what should we eat?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Good question..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">For a moment, Rin rests her chin on her index finger as she looks around and thinks. After a while, Rin's eyes light up. Seems like she found something she wants to eat.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hey, it's been a while since we went there!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">With her finger, Rin points to one of the various restaurants.</p>
