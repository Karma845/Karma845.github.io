  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5">I'm at the library after school, doing some routine work. I'm off to a good start as one hour already passed and I'm still writing. Well, that's because...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ahhh!!! Why the hell did I send that tweet? Nira-san definitely thinks I'm weird."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I need something to escape my current reality and so I turn to my heavy load of work to divert my attention. I was so shocked that I also ended up writing the next chapter without realizing it.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I guess I should post this tomorrow morning..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I cross my arms and stare at the dirty library ceiling. Normally, I would have no qualms with posting it, but I'm hesitating.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">How will Nira-san react? It's highly possible that I got myself involved with a suspicious person.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Thinking about all of this, it feels like I've been run through with a sword.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Nira-san's helpful thoughts and words, they really did help me as a writer though. Yeah, my work definitely didn't do anything wrong.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">To my first fan, I'm sorry that I dragged you into my personal life with my complex relationship with my childhood friend, I really am a stupid author. I need to atone for my sin somehow. With my big sigh, it's natural that I would attract the attention of everyone else.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Why does your face look like it's the last day of summer break?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I notice Rin standing beside me, with a big pout on her face and she's glaring daggers at me. Well, she seems a little different from usual.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Why is your face a little red?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"...Tsk"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Rin?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I-it's just that it's really hot here."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Okay, that's fair."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">It is true that with the lack of ventilation, the library can get pretty hot.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Putting that aside, why are you here?‚Äù</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Please stop acting so pretentious, like you're some high level government worker."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It's pretty great that you can come up with those right on the spot."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Good response. Well... after you're done writing, want to go home together?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Huh?" "Please stop acting like a dumb child."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"No, that's awesome."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">That sounds like an ability I want!</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You aren't going home with Hashimoto-san?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yuumin and Hiyorin already went home."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What was the rush for them?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin avoids my gaze for some reason after my honest question.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well... it's good once in a while to go home with my childhood friend."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin's cheek became even more dyed with red. This definitely isn't because of the library's humidity. She's not being honest and ignoring her true feelings.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">The fact that she is also so prickly with me shows that she trusts me. At least I hope so.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">We've been together for 10 years, I'm sure Rin has some form of attachment to me. At least I hope so.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">However, she is embarrassed to speak so honestly, which is why she chose her words carefully when asking me to go home. At least I hope so.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">At least I hope so... huh? I hate presumptuous people.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You're thinking of weird stuff right now, I know it!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Definitely not."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Please stop sounding so robotic."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You really are amazing."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">And so, we go home together. Honestly, I'm pretty happy. My mind was a mess after lunch when I was imagining Rin being the target of revenge.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I'm really grateful to have met Rin. I'll post my newest chapter tomorrow for sure.</p>
