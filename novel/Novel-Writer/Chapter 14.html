  <div class="calibre4"></div>

  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5">It's 10 AM on Saturday and Rin and I are on the train to the movie theatre in the neighbouring town.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Today is finally happening!”</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You're making this more awkward then it needs to be, stop acting like a kid, it's gross."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, this is way better than what I normally do on the weekend."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin is as prickly as ever. However, my eyes are drawn to her more than usual.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Firstly, she has a fashionable red beret on her head. She's cute.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Her white baggy sweater gives off such a gentle vibe. She's so cute.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Her brown skirt complements her white legs so well, and on her feet are white socks and a pair of loafers. She's so damn cute.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Despite Rin's prickly attitude, seeing her pull off those casual clothes so elegantly is pretty unexpected. Well, I guess you could say this gap is quite amazing! In the first place, I usually only see her in her uniform, seeing Rn in casual clothes is honestly such a reward in and of itself.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Why are you staring so much?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"We-well, you're just so cute."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Cu-cute..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I unintentionally let out my inner thoughts and Rin goes as red as a strawberry. Because of my casual compliment, Rin unsurprisingly gets taken aback and starts acting a bit bashful.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"D-don't act like an idiot, come on, let's get going."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Uh, yeah, sounds good."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">As I listen to her trembling voice, I suddenly recall something from the past.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hmm..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">As if it were only natural, I put out my hand towards Rin.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What are you doing with your hand?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"We did this in the past."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">A sense of guilt washes upon me as I say those words. Rin's eyes start dancing around after what I said and before long, she purses her lips and starts looking down. She mutters something.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You honestly are so unfair."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Unfair?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It's nothing."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin looks at my hand for an instant with an intense sense of greed. But she suddenly makes a fist and turns away.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Come on, we aren't kids anymore."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Haha, my bad."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I recall the times when we were kids and we played at the park's pachinko hall. Times really have changed since then, and a sense of loneliness washes over me. There's nothing I can do to stop the flow of time, though.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">After buying our tickets and drinks, we head to the entrance. We take a seat and as we watch the ads, I remember something.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Oh yeah, the movie we're watching today is apparently a really sad one.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What are you saying?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Don't you cry really easily?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What makes you think I'll just start breaking down when we get to the sad part?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Don't worry, don't worry. It'll be fine.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Tohru-kun."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Despite the fact that we're in a dark theatre, I stare at Rin frowning at me.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Don't you dare make fun of me crying. I already watched a lot of sad anime anyway, so I already built up enough tolerance."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">“Wow, that's amazing. You just set up a massive red flag, will you be alright?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin gives me a smug look, like she's some kid who beat a really hard game.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Raising red flags are only possible in stories. Maybe you're writing too much and you're getting fact and fiction mixed up."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">And with that, the movie begins…</p>
