  <div class="calibre4"></div>

  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5">"Alright, here."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"O-oh, thanks."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">It's lunchtime and as usual I'm in the multi-purpose classroom eating Rin's homemade bento. However, compared to all the other times, I feel more tense.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Why is your voice so shrill today?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You can sense that?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well yeah, I'm your childhood friend after all."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Having said that, Rin snuggles her body right up against my left arm. She's doing it like it's the most natural thing in the world.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Yep, that's why my voice is so shrill today. The distance Rin is putting between us is basically zero. Last week, there was a fist length distance between us, but now...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Something wrong?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"No..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin is giving me a look as if she's telling me she's doing nothing wrong. I am at a loss for words. Jabbing back at her would be something I would normally do, but I bite my tongue and stop myself from retorting back.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Time to dig in..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I put my hands together as I do my best to feign a sense normalcy. As I reach towards the food with my chopsticks, I feel her body heat and her familiar scent. Today's bento is decorated with all my favorite foods, but for some reason I can't taste anything.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">________________</p>

    <p class="calibre5">After we finished eating, we ended up not speaking at all, which is rare. The refreshing spring breeze streams in through the open window, as I gently stroke her cheek. Those rushing winds fill up my eardrum, as I spend my daily life at school like this. Rin is right up and snug against my body, like some lost kitten who got reunited with their parents.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">With Rin like this, I could feel our distance getting ever so closer. Well, it was more like I didn't know before, but lately I've been noticing changes in Rin's actions. This is just another example of that.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I love Rin and I'm sure Rin loves me back. Having realized that, it feels like something has changed inside of me. I might have changed, but I still haven't vocalized my thoughts at all yet.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">As I'm thinking about all of this, I feel my eyelids start to get heavy. I guess it's common to get drowsy after eating. But more importantly, the lingering sensation of warmth and the pleasant scent coming from the person I love is calming me down even more. It's the sense of security you get when you wear a comfy pair of pajamas.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You’re such a sleepyhead today, aren't you?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I hear Rin say that.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Haha, you know me so well."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Of course, I'm your childhood friend."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin repeats that phrase again. I find myself opening my mouth.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yesterday, I stayed up late."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">The sense of security that was there is now gone and replaced with a sense of embarrassment.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I see, you're such a bad boy."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Staying up late suddenly makes me a bad boy?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What were you even doing? Cosplaying as an Australopithecus cosplay and wandering the streets every night?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Cosplaying an Australopithecus would basically mean I would be naked."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I didn't know Tohru-kun was such a pervert. That's such a shame, Well it's not too late, we can turn ourselves in together."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I haven't even taken a step outside my house and I'm already labelled a criminal. I'm not sure how to feel about this at all.”</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, you ruined your entire life with one action."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, of course."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Because of our back and forth, Rin starts laughing. Her cute smile leaves her face after a moment as she asks me something else.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Were you writing?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">The mood in the room gets all awkward.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I see..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Her voice is less sharp than usual.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Don't overwork yourself, okay?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">She's worried about me. My love for her starts overflowing even more.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, I'll keep that in mind."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Gently, I start stroking her face. Rin closes her eyes as she's taking it all in. From my chest, feelings of guilt and regret start gushing out.</p>
