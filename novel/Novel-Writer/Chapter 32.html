  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5">"I'm back..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Welcome home Onii... And Rin too!?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">The echoes of Karen's shocked voice reverberate around the house.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It's been a long time Karen-chan."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin bows her head down courteously.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ahh! I haven't seen you in forever Rin!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Like some kid greeting a costumed character at a theme park, Karen all the way to Rin and hugs her.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"How long has it been?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I think it's been about three years since I last saw you."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It's been that long?! You seem so mature Rin."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You've grown a lot too Karen."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hahaha, I'm in my growing period now."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I can feel myself being enveloped in a weird sense of nostalgia looking at Rin and Karen go back and forth with each other. In middle school, Rin used to come to my house a lot and she played with Karen a lot, who was just starting elementary school. Once we were in our second year of middle school, we started to ignore each other and she stopped coming over. It really has been three years since she last came here.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Are you coming over to hang out Rin?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, you could say that."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Heeeh."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Karen looks at me like her roommate came home in the morning after spending the whole night out.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Did you do it Onii?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What do you mean 'did you do it'!? It's not like that."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I guessed what she implied almost instantaneously, which is why I retorted back almost immediately too.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It's not like that yet."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I hear Rin's voice from behind as she continues.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, it's not like that ye-"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Huh...?</p>

    <p class="calibre7">Meow</p>

    <p class="calibre5">All of a sudden, a white haired cat appears.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ah, Syrup!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Karen yells in excitement as Syrup makes a beeline towards Rin as he starts rubbing his face on her leg.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It's been a long time too, Syrup-chan."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin crouches down and strokes Syrup with her slender hands, as Syrup keeps on purring. Rin closes her eyes wistfully. The scenery of white hair and a lovely girl, it resembles a parent and child. I find that I’m fist pumping without realizing it.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You really are fascinated by this Onii?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I jump in surprise as Karen whispers that in my ear.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I-it's not like that at all, I swear."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You're so easy to understand, But Rin really has gotten so pretty."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well... I can't deny that."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Her face looks sculpted so carefully, her snow white skin, her bewitching long black hair; Rin really is on a whole other level compared to everyone else.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You know, Rin is the one that Syrup likes best."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, as much as that hurts to admit."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">With a laugh, Karen covers her mouth with her hand. Why the hell does Syrup only come for food, but the moment Rin shows up, Syrup acts all buddy-buddy with her. It's been three years since they last saw each other, and yet they're acting so lovey-dovey. It's almost like they were lovers in a past life. Rin starts purring too. Damn it, I can see her stomach now too.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Don't worry, servant."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I'm not your servant."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Then slave?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Alexa, save me..."</p>

    <p class="calibre7">Ping</p>

    <p class="calibre7">"Sorry, I'm having trouble understanding you right now."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I know, I know."</p>

    <p class="calibre7">Meow</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I turn my head over and see Rin petting Syrup to her heart's content as she looks up at me.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Servant, Syrup-chan desires a meal, please go fetch her one immediately.”</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"That’s less of a desire and more of an order..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin goes back to playing with Syrup as I get the cat food. All I feel is the daunting shadow of loneliness starting to slowly swallow me whole. I am the lowest caste in the family after all.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hey Karen-chan, what has Tohru-kun been like lately?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Syrup starts eating away at his food, as Rin asaka Karen that.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hmm, seems like he's been acting gross as usual."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I see you’re using that word again to describe me again for some reason."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Oh yeah, he seemed really happy that Rin was finally coming over."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hey, shut up."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">For fuck's sake. My voice gets all shrill.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I see, then that's good."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"That's good?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I don't understand at all.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Bit that’s good!”</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Karen has a cheery smile and her face is beaming.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Onii, you seem really happy lately, which is why I'm happy Rin came over."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Happy... lately..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">As I repeat what Karen said, Rin's face gets all cloudy as she purses her lips.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Sorry, Karen-chan."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin bows.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">“Is it alright if Tohru-kun and I get some alone time today?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"H-hey Rin?!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">After hearing that, I don't have anything to say to her in response.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Roger that!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">As if she understands what is going on, Karen gives us a salute.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Alright then, I'll play with Ishikawa-kun today."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Uhh, huh? You're already at that stage with Ishikawa-kun where you can hang out with him whenever?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ishikawa-kun will always come running if I call him!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Doesn't that make him your servant? This isn't the time for jokes."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Bye!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I don't have time to confirm whether Karen was joking or not as she runs out the door like she's Usain Bolt. And so the only sounds left are Syrup's munching and our breathing.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Alright."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">With her usual expression, Rin opens her mouth and continues, not giving me any time to object.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Let's go up to your room."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">What the hell have I gotten myself into?</p>
