  <h1 class="calibre1"><span class="calibre3">Chapter 1: My Childhood Friend is the Cutest in the World!</span></h1>

  <div class="calibre4"></div>

  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5">The name's Tohru Yonekura, I'm a sophomore in high school.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I have a childhood friend, Rin Asakura. She has excellent grades, super athletic and quite the artist. She is an all-around generational talent, no doubt about it.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Knowing her from birth, I know all her skills come from countless hours of hard work and not just innate talent.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">In elementary school, she showed no signs of being a genius or athlete. Her art skills were pretty laughable too. However, once she developed her talents, she truly took off. Her abilities became so overwhelming that she basically became an untouchable goddess.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I watched her rapid development throughout middle and high school. While my respect for her grew, so did my loneliness. It was clear we were growing apart.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I would always seclude myself by watching anime and reading web novels, but Rin was no doubt the most popular person at school.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Her dazzling brilliance, there is no way I can ever compare to her. She really is the definition of perfection...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Well, at least on the surface level.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Why does your face look so sour, like you're drinking Coke or something? It’d be great if you stopped that, it’s rubbing off on me too."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Well, she has a bit of an attitude. She always had a sharp tongue. Whenever any guy tried to flirt with her, she could instantly cut them down with her words. Because of that, she basically has no male friend and her female friends are few and far between. Well, not like she minds.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Haha, sorry, I was just spacing out."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin lets out a massive sigh after I say that.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">“Tohru-kun, you're always pulling all-nighters and mindlessly browsing the web. You should stop doing that."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What, because I'll die or something?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, no way. You'll get hit by a truck and you'll reincarnate into a parallel world and live the life of your dreams."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, reincarnating and dying would be the same thing anyways, no?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I give a strait-laced answer and I notice her tense eyes loosen up a bit, and I see the corners of her mouth curl upwards slightly.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Despite her innocent smile, I can feel my heart pounding, like it wants to escape my body. Her soft smile really does look well on her, no doubt about it.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin really is an outstanding beauty, not even taking in my own personal opinion. She is the cutest girl in the world, I know that from the bottom of my heart. It's not just my subjective opinion, it truly is that way.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">She has regal features and is gorgeous from head to toe. Her skin is silky white and she has big, evenly shaped breasts. She has long black hair that goes down to her waist that’s half up in a cute red ribbon. She is about average height for a girl, but she's slim in all the right place. She really does have a model-like figure. While it's embarrassing thinking about it, Rin truly does resemble a Yamato Nadeshiko. Definitely the cutest in the world.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">As if she's carrying around a sword and bow, she uses her sharp words to cut down whoever she's talking to, without a care in the world.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What are you staring at me for? It's giving the creeps."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I'm totally not staring at you."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I might have been glancing at her a bit, but that's too embarrassing to admit out loud.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"All criminals say that!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"If that's what it takes to be a criminal, every Japanese prison will be filled to the brimmed."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">If she'd tone down her sharp words, I'm sure she would make lots of friends. Well, it's not like I mind her attitude at all. There's a sense of familiarity and security to her personality, sort of like eating my mom's meat and potato stew. I'm not a masochist in any way, I'm just used to it because I've known her for a long time.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">You could say her sharp tongue is what bridges us together, something that we share and understand. Because I've fallen in love with Rin, her harsh words give me a sense of happiness of sorts.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">One thing does worry me though. I sometimes hear rumors at school that Rin and I have a "master and pet" type relationship. I do wish I could change that because I know there is some truth to it.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">But I swear, I'm not a masochist.</p>

    <div class="calibre4">
      <b class="calibre6"><span>I want to confess to Rin one day.</span></b>
    </div>

    <p class="calibre5">My love for her is straight. unyielding path that I've always walked on and will keep walking on forever. However, I've always been bad at expressing my honest feelings. I get so nervous everytime I try to confess to her, I'm sure jumping in front of a truck and reincarnating into another world would be much easier.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">But I truly do want to confess to her...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">There's nothing more I want to do than go out with her. Despite her sharp tongue and attitude, I know deep down that she's a kind, hardworking and lonely girl. I would do anything to make her happy.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">But there's no way I could ever confess. I just want to tell Rin I love her so much. After entering high school, I spent so many days worrying over how to confess to her.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Someday, I will tell her how I feel.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">____________________</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Tohru-kun."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What, Rin?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">We're in Rin's room and I notice that she has a different smile on her than usual.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I... looove... you..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">With her arms outstretched, she hugs me and pushes me down. I smell something sweet, like nectar, and her body temperature feels as nice as the spring sun. I can feel both of her breasts pushing down on me. Her face stops a short distance from mine and she slowly sits up on top of me.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">She looks down on me with her arms stretched out. Her shadow casts down on me from above and I see a kind and loving smile appear on her face.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I'm never letting you go."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">She clings onto to me again and buries her face in my chest as she utters those loving words. With my hand, I softly pat her head as she purrs away.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I can’t fathom how cute she really is. I reflect back on what happened, since I'm in disbelief.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">How this all happened, it's quite the long story…</p>
