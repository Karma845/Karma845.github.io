  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5">Hey! Watch Tohru dance around the living room! It's so cute!</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Onii, that's gross."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">And with that single line from his younger sister, Tohru stopped his dance. Ahh, it's all my fault.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Haha, sorry Karen. I'm just a bit excited, that's all."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">“Seriously Onii, it looked like a demon summoning ritual. The fact that you're doing that in front of me is weird.”</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"How do you even know what those are?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I saw it scribbled in permanent marker on one of your notebooks."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You fiend, how in tarnations are you aware of that accursed object!?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">“Well, that's good, isn't it Onii? You got Rin to make you a bento because of it."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, that’s true."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Even with my shameful past being exposed, I have all the more reason to be so elated.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Last night, my eyes were glowing like an infant ready to explore the world. Now this morning, I called upon the Demon Lord with my summoning dance. I've been waiting ages for this.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"No wait, I want to continue these normal days. You'll be seeing my benevolent god soon enough."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"That goddess seems pretty useless, not going to lie."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Aren’t we being rambunctious today? Spewing so much venom so early in the morning is bad for you, I'm worried for you as an older brother."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I'm fine. I'll be talking to my classmate, Ishikawa-kun, so that'll be fun."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"How’s Ishikawa-kun?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Hearing the family name of an unfamiliar elementary school boy is making this gentleman sad for the future.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"By the way Onii, you aren't posting your new chapter?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Huh? Oh..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Hearing that, I got a similar feeling of unease as to when our mom asked us how the testing period was going. All I could think about was Rin's bento, I completely forgot to update my chapter. And all the stuff with Nira-san too...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">At the very least, I want a do-over with Nira-san.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I'm taking a break today."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"That's rare, I don't think you missed a day since you started."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ohh, were you looking forward to reading my new chapter Karen?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I hope a Gundam cuts you down for being too happy."</p>

    <p class="calibre7">Slash</p>

    <p class="calibre7">"I'll burn you down!!!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Artificial Intelligence has been getting dangerous lately."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">The AI revolution will probably happen a lot sooner than most of us will expect it to.</p>

    <p class="calibre7">Meow</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ahh, Syrup!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Karen's voice echoes across the room. Walking around lazily, a white haired cat appears. I recall back to my elementary school days. I'm pretty sure it was a rainy day. In an Amazon cardboard box, I heard a meowing sound, and there I saw the cat "Syrup". At first, I only visited him once in a while. However, over time, I became more attached to him and I started to feed him and now he visits us frequently. He's basically our pet at this point.</p>

    <p class="calibre7">Meow</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Isn't it a bit too early to feed you? Spoiling him would be bad. Hardening my heart, I have to ensure dietary restriction. My appendages and body come together like a sushi roll in order to stop myself.</p>

    <p class="calibre5"><b class="calibre6">Meow Meow Purr</b></p>

    <p class="calibre5">This... demon... argh...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I can't resist his fluffy fur.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"There, there Syrup, I have some special cat food for you!"</p>

    <p class="calibre7">Meow</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Come on Onii, you're spoiling syrup again."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I couldn't stop meowself. How could these hands resist those purrfect eyes."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Why must cats be so damn cute...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Their round and cute eyes, there's no way to stop their pull. And that soft fur, how could I stop my hands from reaching out.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Although Syrup is usually prickly, when you get him in the right mood, he makes all these cute sounds. This is gap moe at its peak.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Thinking about it, this gap in personality is pretty similar to Rin. She's usually pretty cool and collected, but sometimes she can be so sweet sometimes. For an instance, I imagine if Rin wasn't so prickly all the time...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Tohru-kun..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">It's just Rin and I, and we're in a room somewhere. She has her arms spread out.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I want to hug you!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Ahhh, I want to die. Honestly, if something like that were to happen in real life, I'd be fine with dying on the spot. Cause of death? Heart failure from over-exertion.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Onii, your face is so hot, it looks like a melted pylon."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"That's a rare simile for a fifth grader."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Haha, well she is my sister, so of course she is so great!</p>

    <p class="calibre5">We finished eating, but Syrup already left a little while ago. Can't believe he could abandon me like this after I fed him so well. This lonely feeling, it's like after watching a fireworks show and the fireworks have already faded away.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I think Syrup just thinks of you as his feeding servan, Onii."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Please stop. I don't want my reality shattered."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">The theory that it is, in fact, the human and not the cat that is the actual pet is pretty absurd.</p>

    <p class="calibre7">Ding Dong</p>

    <p class="calibre5">“Ahh, seems like Rin is here."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"She came!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I hurriedly put my bag on my back.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Alright, let's go!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Alright."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I can not control my happiness at all, it feels like I won the lottery or something, it's honestly this good. Anyways, I rush immediately to the door, awaiting my prize that's ahead.</p>
