  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5">After school, I finish updating the chapters for today and I head to the washroom. As I'm about to enter, I hear a ping from my phone.</p>

    <p class="calibre7">"The chapter was very interesting today! I couldn't stop laughing when Maika-chan got mad at Ryousuke-kun under the bamboo plant by his house. Thank you so much author!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Nira-san left a comment.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hahahaha."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I let out a laugh, it's just as Rin said, Nira-san still hasn't abandoned me yet. Even though I didn't post my chapter during my regular time, Nira-san still is the first one to leave a comment. That wasn't the only reason I was so happy. I keep reading his comment.</p>

    <p class="calibre7">"PS: I was worried when you didn't post a chapter this morning (I was also a bit sad lol). Please remember to take care of yourself! Anyways, continue doing your best."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">How could I not be happy when reading this? It's no wonder I couldn't stop smiling. I really am thankful to Nira-san for being such a supportive reader. I swear an oath within myself to never skip a day ever again.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I go back to the library and I see Rin sitting in the seat next to mine. She's sitting straight up, reading a small paperback book. There's a cover on it, so I'm not sure what she's reading. The spectacle before my eyes, that being the beautiful girl Rin reading a book, has a certain mystique to it. It's almost picturesque. Yep, Rin really is cute.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You look like a melted pylon, what disgusting things are you thinking of?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I'm getting deja-vu from hearing that phrase."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I sit down in my own seat. The moment Rin notices me, she starts hurling words at me. Then, an image of the past comes into my head.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"This situation, I remember something like this in the past."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What exactly? You holding some cheap charm and praying in front of the convenience store ATM?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"In what world line would I do that?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"One that isn't in a dystopia after World War III, you know, a peaceful world."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"That's not what I mean. I mean when we first met, I was at the library writing, then I went to the washroom and I came back and you were there."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ah..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin peels her eyes away from her book and stares at the ceiling. Her expression seems to give away the fact that she's reminiscing about the past.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ah yes, that did happen."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">A small whisper leaks from her lips, as if she's speaking to herself.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Oh yeah!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I almost forgot, there's one more thing I wanted to tell Rin.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Thank you so much Rin."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Huh? What for?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">While she has a composed expression, she tilts her head in confusion.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You know, for lunch."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ah, it's nothing. Just like how there's always a small chance the knight in shining armour could fall off his horse when he's saving the princess, I just did what I did based on that same probability."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Are you saying my luck caused the knight to fall off his horse?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Is that how you want to interpret that Tohru-kun? You'll make enemies of every shoujo manga reader, you know."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, it doesnâ€™t matter too much to me, otherwise I wouldn't have got a lunch out of it!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">With a clap, I continue.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Just like you said at lunch, that one reader did leave a comment after I uploaded the chapters."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Is that so? Well, that's great."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Almost immediately, Rin gives me a blunt reply.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"No really, it's like you said Rin. I owe you a lot."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Please don't praise me so much."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Huh, why"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin covers her mouth with her book and gives me fleeting glances.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It's embarrassing..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I can hear her voice shaking, sounding all nervous and high pitched. Holy shit, she's so damn cute. I impulsively reach out my hand.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"If you stroke me now, I won't make you lunch tomorrow."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah sorry, I got too caught up in thi- wait what!?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Are my ears deceiving me? This isn't a dream yeah? I pinch both my cheeks.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What are you? Some isekai protagonist who just got transported to another world? Please stop acting so weird."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You'll... make me lunch tomorrow too?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Even with Rin's sharp words, I still need to confirm that with her.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">With that, Rin closes her book. With an impish smile she looks directly at me. Her normally cool and calm smile is now replaced with a much more mischievous one. I can feel my breath getting caught in my throat. She lets out a small laugh. It's rare for Rin to be this mocking.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, well, what should I do?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">This time, I hope that shining knight does fall off his horse. If it means I'm able to get Rin's handmade lunch, I don't care if every shoujo manga reader hates me.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">These strong feelings I sense within myself, it's without a doubt a rekindling of my love for Rin. I recall bits of the conversation we just had, the feeling of nostalgia wells up within me.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">The day I first met Rin.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">That was the day I first fell in love with her.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Even now, I love her.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">On that day, Rin was my shining knight.</p>
