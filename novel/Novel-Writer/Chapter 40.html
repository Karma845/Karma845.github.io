  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5"><span>It really is an amazing feeling to be in your pajamas and wrapped up in your futon when you should be at school. It's almost like getting lost in another world for a short period of time. I get used to looking at my ceiling while I let my mind race. It's pretty clear how I destroyed my physical condition.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Three days ago, I couldn't write a single word, and I couldn't spend a single second working on my story. Even though I was sitting in my chair, with my laptop open ready to write, my mind and body started rebelling against me. I tried forcing myself to write, but that only caused severe headaches and nausea. I ended up having to rush to the bathroom so many times.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>My immune system naturally got a lot weaker from the extreme mental burden I was putting on myself.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"What should I do..."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Honestly, I'm beat. I mean, I had similar experiences before, but not this intense. But anyways, I have to write something. Yeah, I even tried writing a modern romance story, but even then, I couldn't do that. It's like my mind and body is rejecting the act of writing and creating a story itself. It's just like if my survival instinct is stopping myself from being face to face with death. That was the first time that happened for me.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I feel a chill go up my spine. How long will this personal hell go on for? One week? One month? Or perhaps even longer...? Like a bolt of lightning, the worst case scenario flashes across my mind. What if I'm never able to write again? That means my promise with Rin...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I begin to feel nauseous again. Even though there's nothing in my stomach, I feel heat and fluid start to rise up.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Fuck, I shouldn't think of those things.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I put my futon over my head as I close my eyes. I put my hand on my aching stomach as I curl up into a ball. Trying to not think about anything at all, I begin to feel my consciousness start to fade. As if a switch broke, my body's defense mechanisms start to do their job. I can't fight the drowsiness any longer, as I let the darkness take me away. As I sleep, the only dream I see is the darkness staring back at me.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>_________________</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I open my eyes and it's about lunchtime. Thankfully, it seems like my fever is down and I feel somewhat better. While I still feel drowsy, I check my temperature with the thermometer. It's a little higher than normal, but it's great to know that fever won’t last. Once I realize that my health is trending upwards, I feel my stomach crying out for food.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"I think I'll grab a bite to eat..."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I head downstairs to the living room and then...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"></p>

    <p class="calibre7">Meow</p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Syrup comes up to me and gives me a face like he's asking what I'm doing here.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"></p>

    <p class="calibre7">Meeeow</p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>And now he's saying if I'm here, I might as well give him food.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"You seem as lively as ever."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>With a pained smile, I crouch down and start petting Syrup in exchange for the food he'll be getting. It's pretty rare that Syrup isn't acting so antagonistic. It's as if he's saying today is special since he noticed my poor health.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Today is special, huh...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I remember Rin's expression when she said that as I stroked her. Just like then, it's lunch break right about now. I feel a cool breeze against my chest.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"></p>

    <p class="calibre7">Purr Purr</p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I stare at Syrup, who's acting a lot more sweet than usual., I begin to think back on the past ten years Syrup and I shared together, while stroking him.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>It was a rainy day and I was going home from school. I saw a crying kitten inside an Amazon cardboard box and now he's a part of the family.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Time sure does fly. Though I will say, it’s pretty unbelievable that he jumped up above me in the family caste system.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>After pouring some food for Syrup, I start fishing around the cupboard for some food to eat. Unfortunately, I can't find anything that's easy on a sick stomach. Though, Rin's homemade bento comes to mind.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I've always been eating that recently, so not being able to eat that today is a shock to my system, to say the very least. Ahh, I want to eat bamboo rice so bad, but I don't have any...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I'm so hungry...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"I guess I'll buy something to eat."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>The nearest convenience store is a three minute walk, so considering my condition, I should be fine. Getting some fresh air wouldn't hurt either. Just in case, I put on some heavy, warm clothing and a mask before I leave the house.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I feel the warm breeze brush against my cheek. The seemingly eternal winter has finally ended, and we're finally gearing up for the spring season. I feel a soft sensation as I continue my walk towards the convenience store.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Oh my, it's Tohru-kun."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I turn in the general direction of the voice.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Kaoru-san?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>It's Rin's mom, and she's giving me a surprised look.</span></p>
