  <div class="calibre4"></div>

  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5"><span>It's the first Saturday of the new school term and today is the day I promised to meet Rin at her house to eat her homemade cooking. I finished the current chapter of a modern romance story I’m reading on Syosetu and was going to get ready when...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"></p>

    <p class="calibre7">"You have one new administration message."</p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>The moment that red text flashes in my eyes, my heart leaps from my chest. The hell? What did I do wrong? I have no other reason to doubt that. Regardless, I timidly click on the message.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"></p>

    <p class="calibre9">-----!?</p>

    <p class="calibre5"></p>

    <p class="calibre7">"Contact for Novel Publication."</p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>With a jolt and a yell, my whole body hardens up. It's the first time I ever felt like this. I mull over that one phrase over and over in my head. It doesn't feel real at all, despite the fact that my retinas are transferring this info to my brain. It feels like I'm in a dream, but I click to check the contents of the message to confirm the actual message and then I leap out of my house.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I start running.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Where?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>To Rin's house, of course.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>This is the fastest I'm going on a road I haven't even walked down that many times. That familiar two storey house comes into my view, and I press the intercom right away. With a clank, the door opens.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"You came awfully early, Tohru-kun..."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>From inside, Rin comes out and looks at me.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"D-did something happen?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I'm shaking with excitement as I'm asked that, so I'm unable to answer. I normally don't exercise much, so I'm gasping heavily for air due to my all out sprint. My heart is pounding so hard, it feels like it could explode.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"A-anyways, you can come in."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"W-wait."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Even though I'm all a mess, I manage to stick out my hand to show Rin.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"It came..."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I have to do it here and now, as quickly as possible.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"A publisher... contacted me... my childhood friend story... it'll definitely... became a story..."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>All the things I wanted to tell Rin.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"----Ha"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>With both her hands covering her mouth, Rin is at a lost for words. Her eyes are open as wide as they can, she’s probably really shocked as well. It doesn’t take long for Rin to understand the meaning of my words. Some time before, I was just the same as her, eyeing that message.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"It really is... a miracle."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Having finally caught my breath, I utter those cautious words. It really is a miracle. Trying to target readers wasn't my goal at all. I was writing this for my own satisfaction. Hence, I didn't get a lot of views or bookmarks, so I truly believed that it wasn't good enough at all.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"...It's not a miracle at all."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Rin gently denies my statement as she looks directly into my eyes and with her face full of conviction she speaks up again.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Your story was able to touch someone's heart. That's what happened, nothing more, nothing less."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Ahh... she's right. With a thump, a warm feeling descends down on my chest.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"I put my all into writing this."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>My eyes start to burn from all the heat I can feel within.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"It really happened..."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>It really, really did.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"It's good that I didn't give up..."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>One by one, memories of the past start resurfacing in my mind. A bunch of hiragana start to assemble, not even building a story anymore. Little by little, bit by bit, it starts to take form. After such a long, long time, I've finally reached the ever-coveted goal. It really is suffocating, filling me up all inside my body.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Tohru-kun."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I hear Rin's voice.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"I can't take it anymore... I just..."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>While her voice is gentle, she's taken aback.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Wh-what are you saying...?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Rin's hand finds itself on my cheek. I notice the sensation on that part of my face. I can feel both my eyes, the source of all my emotions, starting to well up</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Is it alright... if I cry...?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>As if she could completely read my heart, Rin pulls the final trigger.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Go ahead."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>With those words, I crumble. The barriers holding me back have finally burst. I'm not able to hold it any longer. Rin embraces me, as the tears start to overflow, not once stopping. I bury my face in her neck, as I continue crying like a baby. Thoughts of me being shameful and uncool don't even surface. But this is the first time I'm crying in front of Rin.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Before, I didn't want to be seen crying and I would feel guilty making Rin sad too, so I was able to bury my emotions. When I was going through tough times, I was able to hold out with my reason.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>But this time, it's different. I'm happy and completely satisfied, there isn't an ounce of regret within me. However, I really did believe I would be rewarded for writing everyday for five years. Plus,this story is the one that I've put all my heart and soul into. Because of that, I'm just really really happy. That's why I can't hold myself anymore. That's why I'm crying. Rin told me it's alright, that I can cry. In the end, I couldn't hold it in any longer.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"You did your best... you always did your best."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>It's a soft, kind voice. She pats my back as if I were a baby as she makes more soothing remarks. Her kindness only triggers my tears even more.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"You really did... do your best all these years."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>My tears keep coming as I listen to those warm, kind sympathetic words, One after another, I'm flooded with a torrent of emotions. I feel warmth, what is it? My tears? Rin's body heat?</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>My ability to think is all but gone due to my emotional outburst. However, the smallest bit of my reasoning starts to stir up within me. Everything that happened, the fruits of my labour, it isn't just my victory alone. I was able to see the result through because of Rin.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>It was because of Rin that I wanted to become an author.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>If it wasn't for Rin, I probably would have lost interest during grade four.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>It's because of Rin that I kept writing.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>If it wasn't for Rin, I would have stopped uploading stories on Syosetu after a month.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Rin and I, we're joined at the hip. Whenever I would lose my way, she would bring in a sense of calmness, whenever I would run on ahead, she would chide me and whenever I would break, she would be there to console me with kind words. She was always there, supporting me every step of the way. She's by my side, forever and always, I really am so grateful.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Thank you,</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"></p>

    <p class="calibre7">Thank you,</p>

    <p class="calibre5"></p>

    <p class="calibre9">Thank you.</p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>No matter how many times I say it, it won't be enough. But really...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Tha- thank you... so mu-much... than..."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I try to convey my gratitude, but no words come out, only miserable tears. Rin, with a happy expression on her face, nods countless times. And then...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Me too... I'm really, really..."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>We both have the same words for each other. However...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Tha...nk you... so mu...ch..."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Her words stop there. Was it because of my tears or there is another reason why she's welling up with emotion? She puts her arms around my back as she begins crying too. She tries to stifle her crying, but in the end it’s too much and we both end up crying like children. Her wailing is the result of finally releasing all the energy from keeping a calm composure all the time.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Standing in front of the Asakura household, the two of us hug each other as we cry away. Our long, long has finally ended, as the very symbol of joy has blessed the two of us.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>We cried for a long time, until it took a huge strain on our bodies, so we stopped and calmed down. Naturally, we separate from each other, as we look at each other's faces. We then started speaking.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Your face is a mess."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Yours too."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>We both start laughing. Once our tears are sorted out, we start laughing from the bottom of our hearts. We surrender ourselves to our emotions as we continue laughing hysterically.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"The charms."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>That suddenly popped into my head, as I say that in between my laughs.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Both of our prayers get answered."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Yeah, I guess we don't have to hold onto them anymore."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Laughing happily, I can still see remnants of tears floating in her eyes. It's such a cute smile. Being able to see that smile after all the years of hard work makes it all worth it. It's the smile I love the most, after all. I hug Rin again. I don't let my emotions get the better of me as I treat her with care, my precious treasure. Rin hugs back too, as our bodies are glued closely to one another.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>There isn't any distance between us anymore.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>As we indulge ourselves in each other's heart, we look at each other again. Looking up at me with a hint of embarrassment, Rin speaks up, as I can hear the spring in her voice.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Anyways, how about we throw a party today."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I'm sure compared to all the other times Rin has cooked for me, this feast will be the most delicious.</span></p>
