  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5">"Yonekura-kun, you seem tired today."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">It's lunch break and I get ready to go eat Rin's homemade bento when the class president, Hashimoto-san, approaches.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Huh, you think?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hmm, I mean you have shadows under your eyes."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Really?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I start rubbing my eyes. My eyelids do feel heavier than usual today. Well it makes sense given that I spent the entirely of last night writing</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It's probably a lack of sleep."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, I get you."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">With a clap, Hashimoto-san puts her hands together.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You know, staying up so late all the time is bad for you."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">She's scolding me like some misbehaving kindergartner. She’s even sticking her index finger in the air. However, her face softens after.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"So, how are things with Rin lately?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What do you mean 'how are things'?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You know what I'm talking about."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Hashimoto-san gives me a wide, pure smile.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Nothing much, it's pretty much the usual."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hey, don't start looking away!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Easy to read as ever, Hashimoto-san gives me a wry smile.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Why are you asking me all of this all of a sudden?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Oh, no reason. I was just curious."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Having said that, Hashimoto-san gives me another one of her smiles.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, lately you seem to be having a lot of fun, so I thought it was because things were going well with Rin-chan."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">What exactly does she mean when she says things are going well? Well, I have an idea but I won't delve deeper into it. I'll just respond to the first part of her sentence.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It looks like I'm having fun?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, you definitely look quite lively."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I put my hand on my jaw as I think things over. Well, maybe she does have a point. Lately, I've been feeling more positive more often. Suddenly, an idea pops into my head.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hey, pres."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You can call me Yuumin."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Okay, I have a hypothetical question."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I know the situation I'm talking about isn't hypothetical, but I go on anyways.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"So... if a girl makes a bento for a boy... invites him on a date... bring him to her house... that’s normal, right?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Hashimoto-san thinks about my awkwardly phrased question for a moment before clapping her hands together like she had an epiphany. She then puts her index finger on her chin and makes some unnatural noises.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Of course it's normal. Well, each person is different so I can't really say for sure."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">She has a devious smile on her face as she says that.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, at least for me... it'd be something I'd do for the person I like."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">As she said that, I felt a stroking sensation on my chest.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Is that so..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I scratched my head with the back of my hand. She basically told me what I already knew, I’m not that stupid.. At this point, I just wanted some proof either way, even though it's already too late to ask.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Thanks Hashimoto-san."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Oh, you’re finally calling me by my name."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"So pres it is, I guess."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You're going back to that again..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Hashimoto-san starts laughing.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Alright, I'll be going now."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You're eating lunch with Rin again, aren't you."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Of course you would know."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, of course."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I detect a hidden meaning behind her smile. Well, Rin and Hashimoto-san do hang out a lot, so it makes sense if she does know. Not like I really care or anything.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Anyways, I'm off."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I stand up from my desk and take my leave.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yonekura-kun!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I turn back and see Hoshimoto-san with her smile as always. She has her fist out in front of her chest.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Do your best!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I don't reply to her yell, but I give her a nod as I leave the classroom.</p>
