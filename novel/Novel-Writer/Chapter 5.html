  <div class="calibre4"></div>

  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5">Rin and I are walking home together. I can feel that something is amiss as we're nearing the station closest to school. For one reason or another, Rin’s a lot closer to me than usual. This morning she was about 30cm, now it's about 15 cm.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Tssk...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">It'd be best if I put some distance between us. And Rin notices immediately and closes the gap.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Say Rin..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, the police are coming after you!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Is that so, I’m totally innocent anyways? Anyways, aren't you a bit close to me right now?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Slowly, Rin starts to move her body away from me. She's definitely trying to feign ignorance.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What do you mean?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Don't play dumb, you know exactly what I mean!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I carefully observe her and notice her blinking many times over and how she's pursing her lips. This is exactly what she's like when she's lying.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"It's just your imagination, you're overthinking things. I can't believe you're using your useless brain to think about meaningless crap. Do something that'll make me laugh for a change."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"On the contrary, the fact that you care so much about this shows it isn’t meaningless!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">That's a good response, if I do say so myself. Though, I'm sure the person on the receiving end isn't too fond of it, in fact they might be in a bit of a temper. Rin acts just like a cat sometimes. Her actions and words can get confusing sometimes. I'm not entirely sure what the reason is. What I do know is that she gets into these tempers and while I might not know why, I have to accept it. That's the adult way of handling things. It is a bit delusional</p>

    <p class="calibre5">The explanation for Rin's actions, huh...</p>

    <p class="calibre7">Well, it's the winter season and there's no one I can cuddle with, but I have my childhood friend... I can hang out with him.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Aren't I just making up convenient lies? Well, it's fine, They're just delusions anyways.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You're definitely thinking of something disgusting right now. Your brain is probably filled with rotting syrup now.”</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I'm thinking of important stuff right now, it could impact my life as we know it."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">We arrive at the station, get on the train and get off the station nearest our homes. We're still walking side by side. As punishment for my evil thoughts, we went back to walking 30cm apart. It's a bit lonely.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Still, it feels like Rin has changed a little. Looking at our conversations, it’s usually just me spouting some random BS and Rin cutting it down every time. You could say it's as cold as the rural wind. But lately, it feels like she's losing her edge. For one reason or another, I can't get that difference out of my mind. Usually, she would go home with Hashimoto-san and her other friends, but today, she decided to wait for me to finish writing to go home together.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">No matter how you splice it, she definitely is trying to narrow the distance between us. I guess our normal has shifted for some reason. It's definitely not something that arose on a whim, there definitely is a reason why, but I have a feeling that I do know, but I'm consciously burying it. But I think my hunch is spot on...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"By the way..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I hear Rin. It's odd of her to talk like this out of nowhere.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Tohru-kun, did you buy your regular bread for lunch?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Uhh, yeah. It's cheap and pretty good to boot. Quite the saviour for students like me, if I say so myself."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Say... if you had a free, ready-to-go and delicious lunch, you'd eat it yeah?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, of course, who'd be crazy to pass on that?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">......</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Umm, Rin?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"...Bento."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Her voice falls to a quiet whisper, being almost inaudible.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Do you want a bento?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Before I know it, Rin's soft gaze meets mine. Her face is expressionless as always, but she's blinking more than usual, her lips are quivering and her cheeks are red. Her eyes look so clear and pure, like the driven snow. Is she feeling anxious right now?</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Are you saying what I think you're saying Rin?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Don't get the wrong idea you mutt. I always make a bento for myself anyways, I'm just helping out my lonely childhood friend, nothing more. I'm basically like your goddess at this point and you should shower me with praise."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"So this is who my goddess is, huh..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Shut up! Not all gods will take you to a parallel universe."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Do you have a black notebook then?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I have a notebook filled with incomprehensible scribbles and chants like Inferno Phoenix and Crimson Moon Angelica."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Stop digging up my dark history! How do you even know that existed!?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">That notebook is my deepest secret, and my most embarrassing secret.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"So, what do you think?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin switches back to the question about the bento. I answer without hesitation.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I'd like to eat your bento!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I declare that with all my might, my arms in a triumphant pose. For one reason or another, I was expecting my gusto to be met with a judgemental glance from Rin. But that didn't happen.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Alright... then."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">She replies back with a more faint voice than usual. Her eyes are downcast and the corners of her mouth are raised slightly. She's so easy to read, she's definitely happy about the turn of events. She's cute as hell...</p>

    <p class="calibre7">Thump Thump</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Gradually, I begin to feel the onset of heat on my hands and I can feel the texture of skin. Without thinking, I find that I reflexively put my hand on Rin's cheek.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hah..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin gives me an uncharacteristic moan.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"S-sorry, my bad."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I remove my hand right away.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Why did you suddenly touch me? It's pretty strange, you're acting like a molester or something."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin puts her hand where I touched her and goes off on me as fast as a bullet train. But her facial expression doesn't seem as annoyed as she's letting on. That might be wistful thinking on my part...</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Sorry, I got caught up in the moment."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Geez, if it wasn't me, you would have come to your senses."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Haha, I'm sorry about that."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"... It's fine."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin is glaring at me while giving her whispered response. Her childish pouting really is cute too.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You were just like this as a child."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Suddenly, those memories come flooding back to me. I clearly recall the dimly lit classroom. The smell of dust and chalk hit my nose. The vivid image of tears rolling down her face, as I comfort her erupts in my mind.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"That was so long ago..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I whisper softly as I place my hand in front of my chest.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Anyways, I'll make the bento and give it to you tomorrow morning."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, thanks so much, I'll be looking forward to it."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">My earnest words cause the corners of Rin's mouth ro raise again.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">__________________</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Honestly, I was bursting with happiness then. I seriously couldn't wrap my head around it. But the real reason Rin decided to make me a bento, I only realized why a little while afterwards.</p>
