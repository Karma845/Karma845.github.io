  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5"><span>After our initial meeting at the library, I would begin to spend more time with Tohru-kun. Tohru-kun would continue writing stories while I would continue to read. Every day was like that. Spending the days like that, it really was a lot of fun. Little by little, I began to understand Tohru-kun. He's radiant like the sun, which was a far cry from me, who lacked any self-confidence, her head always hanging down low.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>One day, I told Tohru-kun about how I was worried about the way I talked and how everyone in my class thought about it. He responded immediately.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"I don't think it's all the bad. Your way of speaking is pretty cool!"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>He cut down my worries with a smile. He was as kind as ever. Hearing those words made me happy beyond belief.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Thanks... a lot."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I could feel my voice shaking a lot.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>And on another day, I told Tohru-kun about my worries of how I wasn't good at studying or athletics at all. Again, he responded immediately.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Don't say that! Rin-chan, you're super cute, your way of speaking is so cool and you're always so honest, you're definitely not worthless!"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Again, with his bright smile, Tohru-kun cut down my worries. Even though he didn't realize it, his words saved me from a dark place. Again, I was so, so happy.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Thanks... so much."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>My voice was trembling again.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>And on yet another day, I told Tohru-kun that I had no friends in my class. I also told Tohru-kun how much fun I had spending time with him after school.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Th-then, let's be friends."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>For some reason, his usual composure wasn't there.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"I don't.... really have any friends in my class either. So I would be really happy if I became friends with you, Rin-chan."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Tohru-kun looked at me, his eyes fluttering and cheeks red, as he asked me that. Why did my chest start feeling weird again? I answered, trying my best not to make my mouth go all loose.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Yes, of course."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>On that day, Tohru-kun and I became friends.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>______________</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Because the way I spoke was different from everyone else, I was teased a lot. Looking back, it was more bullying than teasing though. On yet another, I was being bullied again, this time in the multi-purpose classroom. My eyes, my way of speaking, my terrible grades and athletic abilities, all of it. My classmates kept bringing up all the things I wanted to forget, and each time, it felt like a massive weight was being placed on my chest. Eventually, I reached a tipping point and I started bawling. My classmates left me all alone in the classroom, satisfied at what they were looking at. And so, I was all alone crying to myself. Both my heart and body were frozen as I didn't move one bit. Therefore, I didn't go to the library that day either. In my mind, I was apologizing to Tohru-kun many times over. And then...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"What's wrong?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>This scene played out like one of these shoujo manga I read recently, like a prince on a white horse coming to save the princess. Perhaps, this was what the princess felt like. Tohru-kun found me. I just felt so relieved, happy. However, there was a bit of sadness left in me. Tears kept on flowing out as I still needed more time to sort through my emotions.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Tohru-kun then came up to me and started gently stroking my cheek. He continued to stroke my face without saying a thing as I began to calm down. It was thanks to him that I was able to calm down like I did. I kept apologizing for not going to the library, for making him worried and a whole bunch of other things.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Why are you apologizing?"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>As if he didn't care, Tohru-kun asked me that. I shook my head as I felt so much warmth stockpiling in my chest. Afterwards, Tohru-kun took me to a burger place.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"When you're sad, eating something yummy is the best, that's why!"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>That was what he said, and he was right, It was the first time I ate a teriyaki burger and it tasted better than any other treat I ever had. I kept stuffing my cheeks. It was Tohru-kun's kindness that helped calm me down, and yet my eyes still felt a little moist.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>From that day onwards, we started hanging out more and not confining ourselves to the library after school.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>________________</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>After eating at the teriyaki burger place, things changed a bit, well maybe a lot. Quite a few things changed in fact. Whenever I was with Tohru-kun, my heart would start pounding and my face would get all hot. Those emotions I felt when I saw Tohru-kun take in that kitten started flooding back to me. At that time, I wasn't able to vocalize my emotions, so I continued going about each day with doubt. And so, one day...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Hey, I brought you this cool thing today!"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>With that, Tohru-kun gave me a present. It was a pastel pink charm, with some difficult kanji written on it. This was a present for me to not cry anymore after I bawled my eyes out a few days prior. I could feel my chest ringing like crazy.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"This color is really cute, isn't it? It totally suits you well Rin!"</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Cute, suits me well...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>My heart started to dance like crazy, hearing those words. What is this? I couldn't control my happiness at all. I felt afloat, like I was on the porch facing the sunlight. Before I knew it, I was panting. What was this strange feeling? At the time, I really didn't understand those emotions at all. But I would understand before long, so I wasn't worried. I was already so happy then.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>"Thank you... so much."</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I verbalized all my gratitude to Tohru-kun as I hugged the charm close into my chest.</span></p>
