<h3>Afterword; From here on now:</h3>


    <p class="calibre5"><span>The title of this chapter is as much Tohru-kun conveying his thoughts to Rin-chan as it is me conveying my thoughts to everyone reading this afterword. People may find this part redundant, but this is the most important theme I wanted to convey in this story, so I appreciate your kind understanding.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>So anyways thanks to all of you who read "Forever and Always, My Childhood Friend is the Cutest Girl in the World”! This is the end of Tohru-kun and Nira... no, Rin-chan's story. I thought about continuing for about a few more chapters, but I managed to convey the main theme of the story, so I think this spot is the best place to conclude.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Looking back on this work, about a month ago, the top ranked stories for modern romance stories where childhood revenge stories. I felt my chest hurt, which gave birth to something. Seeing so many unlucky childhood friends one after another, there wasn't one childhood friend who was able to be happy... So after one night thinking about it, I started writing this working without any plot or plan in mind. And the result of this work is something I will never forget for the rest of my life.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>It's the one work that helped me grow the most. I had so much fun writing this from the beginning to the very end. Updating every day. without once taking a break and I was able to meet so many readers who followed along with my rampage. That made me really happy.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I'm really thankful to all the readers that left bookmarks, rating, comments and reviews. It's thanks to everyone's support that I was able to keep on writing despite all the fatigue from overtime and hangovers. To all of you reading this right now, each one of you are my Nira-san. I'd like to give my heartfelt thanks to all of you. Thank you so much!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Let's see, from now on... I think the future for the two of them is still on my mind.... If I continue writing beyond this point, it'll also help with my own growth, so that's a good opportunity...</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>How about I write a sequel!!!!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>There are still some loose ends that need to be tied up with some characters like Yuumin, Hiyori-chan, Ishikawa-kun, Ishikawa-kun and did I mention Ishikawa-kun? (I'm afraid that the expectations for Ishikawa-kun will skyrocket even though I haven't even shown him once).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Well anyways, that part in chapter one where they say "I love you" to each other hasn’t even happened yet, so I guess I have to write a sequel now orz.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Now that the two of them are openly lovers, the story will be even more sweet. Holding hands, headpatting, hugging of course sleepovers. Maybe K I S S E S too (I have to restrain myself lol)</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>So, make sure to bookmark, so you'll receive an alert when it happens!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>That being said, it might be awhile before I update anything. The organization, events, themes and so on haven't been decided at all yet, but when I started writing this story and it started seeing success, I stopped paying attention to my previous work. My previous work is about 30,000 characters long. I stopped updating it, so I'd like to start updating it soon.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>By the way, Hiyorin, who Rin's friend in this story, is the main heroine for my previous story (She's quite the lively character). The class president, Yuumin, also makes an appearance (both are pretty prominent characters). That's my first story, but compared to this story it’s pretty out there.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Compared to this story, the composition is ten times more messy and it's pretty robust. If you haven’t read it yet, the sequel is done, so I'd be really happy if you checked it out (While Rin is cute, Hiyorin is also really cute, it's the truth!).</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>I took my time to conclude my previous work, but the sequel for this story will update frequently when it does happen. I'll be able to announce the new story I'm working on soon. Well, at least I have that planned out. It'll be another sweet and sentimental story, I want to surround all my readers with syrup as quickly as possible!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>That being said, I don't want to write something that is just a sweet story, I want to write something that can leave a ripple on the reader's heart after they are done. Well then, I soaked myself long enough in the lingering feeling of finishing a work for the first time in my life.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Finally, I have a request for all my readers. After reading this, please tell me "This is interesting", "Good job!" and "I'll be waiting for the sequel!" and I'd be happy if you give this five stars. I'd appreciate thoughts and reviews too! It will be a great reference for the next work that I'm making in the future.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>And last but not least!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>AHHHH!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>That was fun!</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Until next time, I'll meet you in the sea of syrup.</span></p>

    <p class="calibre5"><span>Thank you all very much! I'm grateful to every single of you that read this.</span></p>
