    <p class="calibre5">"Tohru-kun, you want to be an author?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">It had been about a year since I first met Rin. We were in the library after school as per usual when Rin, who was sitting beside me, suddenly asked me that.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, I wanna be one!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I wanted to be an author like Maple Satou. Just like last year, my dream hadn't changed at all. With my answer, Rin steeled herself and pursed her lips.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Here..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Timidly, Rin gave me something. The object in my hand looked familiar.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"A charm?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">The charm had some kanji on there I couldn't read, but it was a charm for blue collar workers.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"...Yeah, it's a charm for the realization of a dream. I'm sure this charm will help make your dream come true."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin's eyes fidgeted around as she said that.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I thought... it would help you a bit."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Her cheeks became as red as strawberries and her pupils were shaking with unease. After I received that charm from Rin, I expressed my honest feelings to her.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Thanks so much! That makes me really happy!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">It was Rin's present. And something that could help me achieve my dream. There's no way I wouldn't have been happy. I could see the evident relief on Rin's face from my reaction.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Now we have matching charms."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I remembered the pastel pink charm I had given to Rin a while back.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yep, a matching set."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Rin closed her eyes as she smiled.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I'll make sure I'll do my best to become an author!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I squeezed my fist tightly as I declared my resolve to the world.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yes, I'll help out too."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">My only friend, the girl I love, was helping me out. I swore to become an author no matter what. That's what I truly believed at the time.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">And if I don't? That possibility didn't even cross my mind. I truly believed I was going to become an author.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Tohru-kun... you really are amazing."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I heard those words spill from Rin's lips. And so, she looked at me with so much respect and she began squeezing her fists the same way I was doing it.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I'll do my best too."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Her voice was barely audible, but I could feel the determination from it.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">And after that day, every day after school, Rin replaced the manga she had been reading when she sat beside me with textbooks.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">____________________</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I'm back..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Welcome home."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I come back home and I hear my sister's voice from the living room.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"How was Rin's homemade cooking?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, it was great."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I give her a short answer, but instead of going to the living room, I head up to my room instead. I see my bookshelf packed with books about writing, I spot the pajamas I wore this morning too, but I head to my desk and open one of the drawers.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I take out what's inside and put it into my hand. It's the blue collar charm, with the words "Realization of a dream" written on it. It's faded a lot with time.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I really am so pathetic..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I stare at the charm as I remember the answer I gave nine years ago.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"But..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I grasp the charm tightly in my hand.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I'll work hard and do my best."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I made a promise with Rin, I'll definitely become an author on day. That's why, no matter what, I'll make sure it will happen. Once I become an author, I can finally stand shoulder to shoulder with Rin. Who I am now, it's no good at all.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I grasp my desk as I reflect back. There are two reasons why I can't ask Rin about her feelings now.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Firstly, Rin is a flawless beauty and I can't even compare to her. Basically, I have low self-esteem. However, Rin's recent words and actions have somewhat negated that.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Secondly, I have no right to stand side by side with Rin. I won't allow it right now at all. Rin Asakura: she has amazing grades, is quite the athlete and has so many artistic talents. She has it all.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">And me?</p>

    <p class="calibre5">My grades and athletic ability are average at best and my artistic abilities are basically non-existent. I originally spent all my time writing, but even that hasn't taken off like I wanted it to. That's the current state my promise with Rin is in right now.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I haven't accomplished anything.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">There's no way I can confess my feelings to Rin like this, there's no way I even compare to her. There really only is one solution to this problem.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I hang the charm on my desk light. I open my laptop and take a seat. I open up my word processor and let myself be engulfed in the world of words.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Even when the sun set, even when I was called for dinner, I continued typing away, putting all my soul in my story.</p>
