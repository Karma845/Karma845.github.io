  <div class="calibre4">
    <p class="calibre5">"Alright, got it updated."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">It's Wednesday morning and in my living room updating my story like I normally do. I top it off with my usual black coffee.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Good job Onii."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Karen's munching on a toasted sandwich as she says that to me. And as usual, our banter begins.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Fuu...."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What's wrong Onii? You seem less perky than usual."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Really? I don't really think I'm acting that different."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You aren't saying your usual gross statements today."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"So your only basis on my mental state is how many gross comments I make?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Well, Karen does have a point. Since the beginning of this week, I've been heavily sleep deprived.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, I’ve been updating my story more frequently now. I've been staying up late too."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Up until now, I've updated once every morning, but now I update twice a day with one in the mornings and one at night. Because of that, I've been going to bed pretty late nowadays.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I see."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Her voice is drowned out by her munching on strawberry shortcake.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Don't push yourself too much Onii."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You serious Karen?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"If you say you'll rent a younger sister, I'll take the doorknob from your room.”</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Hey, don't do that!"</p>

    <p class="calibre7">Ping</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I hear the notification sound come from my laptop.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ah, he never skips a day."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Nira-san?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I really am thankful."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">By the way, Nira-san has been sending me messages at night too. Seriously, does he ever sleep?</p>

    <p class="calibre7">"Today's chapter was also really good! Ryousuke-kun was such a man today! The way he gave Maika-san that ring made my chest thump so much (The fact that the ring was made of bamboo was awesome too!). So this is the end? It's been such a fun ride, thank you so much author! PS: Thank you for updating the story as frequently as you have, don't overwork yourself though!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ah, thank you so much Nira-san."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Since I've been updating more frequently, the burden I've been putting on myself increased a lot. But with this, I believe I can continue towards my path on fulfilling my promise with Rin. Also, having Nira-san and everyone else's encouragement helped out a lot. I just feel so thankful towards all of them.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"By the way Onii, you're done with your story?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">After I finish typing out my reply to Nira-san, I hear Karen ask me that, which makes my heart skip a beat.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ka-karen!? Don't tell me you were following my story the whole way through..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, I just happened to find the first chapter."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I found myself just happening to fall over.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ah, Ishikawa-kun?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Yeah, yeah, he said it felt like it was ending soon."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Someone that young is able to guess when my story is going to end, he has the makings of a genius."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I definitely need to meet up with him sometime. Now that I have some breathing room, I should definitely host a party.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"You're already thinking of making a new story?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Of course!"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I give her a thumbs up.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"My next work will be set in a dark alternate universe. The protagonist gets kicked out of his party when he suddenly awakens the omnipotent power that will allow him to dominate everyone. That's the basic synopsis."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"So, you're doing another fantasy story."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Well, I do need to expand my horizons and improve my abilities."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Huh..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"What's wrong?"</p>

    <p class="calibre5">“Umm you know, it sort of feels like you enjoy yourself a lot more when you're writing romance stories. It feels weird when you don't."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Ahh..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I get what Karen means when she says that. It's kind of apparent that my enjoyment is way higher when I write modern romance.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"But if I don't then things might not go as well for me..."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I made a promise with Rin. If I want to be a pro author, I need to get my work published somehow and fantasy stories have the best odds of getting noticed. I'm planning my next story with that in mind. If I want to get published, going with the trends and doing something that's popular is top priority.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">That's why I have to write a fantasy story.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">It's very clear that on the top of the rankings for the fantasy genre are stories about cheats, being stronger than anyone else and making harems. I have to incorporate those elements if I want a story to get published. Once enough readers are interested and want to keep reading, they'll bookmark it and my points will increase. Once I accumulate enough points, I'm sure publishers will start to take notice.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">It's a simple plan.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I thought I would continue writing fantasy when I first started out. In the end, my writing abilities were simply not good enough, Although it was pretty popular, it wasn't good enough to get noticed by publishers. Because I was down on myself, I decided to write a modern romance story on a whim.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Even though I decided to start on an impulse, I analyzed the trends of the genre and tried to tailor my work accordingly. Compared to fantasy, since there's not that many out there, I thought I would get noticed by a publisher, but that never happened. The amount of views, bookmarks and eventually points I received was considerably less compared to my fantasy work.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">I definitely noticed that there's no way to go against the demand of the crowd. I let out a sigh as I mull that over in my head. I make a fist as I tell Karen something.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"I want you to tell Ishikawa-kun something. For my next work, I might not be able to meet his expectations."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Karen was quiet for five seconds before she said anything.</p>

    <p class="calibre5">"Alright...."</p>

    <p class="calibre5">Karen nods in response, but she looks dissatisfied. Her gloomy facial expression combined with my nagging in her chest felt like dark storm clouds signalling something ominous to come.</p>
