<h3>Chapter 23 &#8211; Hunting the Adventurer Killer ③</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Dieeeee!
You shit human!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
had reached the level of 1500. He is very confident his opponent would not be
able to match him. That's why he recklessly swung his sword.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
block the sword with the wand in my hand, then push his sword away until his
defenses fell apart.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">The
next moment I hit Kaito's stomach, which is full of gaps with my wand.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Gugeee!?"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
won't feel satisfied if I kill him instantly, so I hold back my power. But the attack's
momentum is more than enough to make Kaito rolls down on the ground. And when
he sank on the ground...</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Ough,
guuu, geee--"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
even threw up a lot. It is the right time to finish him off, but…. Kaito's way
of fighting is just too weak, and I unconsciously let out a heavy sigh.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"All
you can do is swinging your sword like a boar without thinking. There is no
strategy, no tricks, no reading your opponent's movement. It's so full of gaps
that I wonder if it's a trap. ...... was that your real strategy?"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
I pointed that out, as a knight, Gold couldn't help but comment too.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"As
my Lord said, this guy's basic swordsmanship is lacking. Erio and his friends,
who are still learning the basics of swordsmanship, are better than
him..."</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">To
raise my adventurer rank, I want to capture the "adventurer killer"
before anyone else, extract information from him, and then kill him.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
don't want to kill him right away, but I want to make him suffer for his crimes
of attacking Erio and the others.......</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">But
he is so weak that I may accidentally kill him before he feels the pain.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
never expected him to be this weak.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"---Sshu"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
we are discussing our impressions, Kaito is enraged. Maybe his nausea has
subsided, and flames seem to light up in his eyes.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
is drooling from his mouth and shouting like a madman.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Kill!
I'll kill you! I'll definitely kill you! Grandiuuusssss!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Sharank!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">With
a sound like a musical instrument, Grandius' sword shakes to create many sword
duplicates.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">There
are 30 of them in total.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kaito
is kneeling on the ground, and then he points his Grandius sword to me.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Skewer
that shit human!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">At
his command, 30 swords flew toward me like arrows.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
hadn't taken a single step because I didn't feel the need to.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(I
have a bad feeling about this. I'll just avoid it.)</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
followed my instincts and moved my feet.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Several
of them stab the spot where I was standing, and the rest continue to follow me
move around.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Its
speed is the same as it was the first time.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(That's
enough to kill an ordinary adventurer or monster. But from the atmosphere, I
know there's more.....)</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
I am pondering about it, I reflexively swing my staff towards my back.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Tou!"</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Tsk!</span></span><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">You managed to block that
attack!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
used his sword as a foothold and deflected the sword coming from behind me.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">He
irritably gritted his teeth.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
underestimated you at first because you look like a magician, but I didn't
expect you to be a first-class warrior! You're disguised as a magician to catch
your opponent off guard. This is why I hate cowards and sneaky humans!</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"?
Well, I'm technically a magician, but..."</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"No,
there is no magician who can fight me equally like you! Stop mocking me!" </span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I'm not mocking him.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">According to Mei and the
others, my fighting skills as a vanguard are not high enough to be considered
an expert. But as a rearguard, I can use the infinite Gacha cards to cast
spells almost as good as a first-class magician.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">If
I had to define it, it would be a new occupation called "infinite card
magician," which has never existed in this world before.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">So,
in terms of classification, I can call myself a magician.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"As
expected of Dark-sama! Cleverly make the opponent lose his composure! What a
skilled fighter!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Meanwhile,
Nemumu somehow misunderstands that I'm talking as a tactic to make Kaito lose
his composure.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">That
may be the result, but I'm not even trying to do such a thing.......</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Enough!
Stop making fun of me!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Kite
swings his sword and directs his multiple swords flying towards me again.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Just
nice.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It's
a good opportunity to prove that I'm technically a magician.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Ice
Sword!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Using
"R, Ice Sword" card, I create 25 ice swords around me.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
also accurately directed them to intercept the 25 swords that were coming
towards me.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">This
makes Kaito so surprised as if his face splashed with water.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Eh,
without a chant? And to create that many ice swords!</span></span><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Im, impossible....
impossible, impossible, impossible! Are you really a magician? There's no way a
magician can fight me like this!?"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"I
told you already. I'm classified as a magician."</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">In
addition to that, it is an advanced technique to cast multiple spells and
control them at will.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It's
a skill I learned in Ellie's magic lesson.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">For
me, the limit is around 30, but Ellie can control more than 1,000 easily.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">As
expected of the 'Forbidden Witch'.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">(But
Kaito's swords are also quite impressive. I didn't expect them to create fire,
wind, and lightning when I hit them with my ice swords.)</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Apparently,
not only the sword can duplicate itself, but it can also put magic into the
duplicates</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2"><span></span>without using the user's magic power.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">That's
quite impressive.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">When
I am focusing on Kaito's sword, he noticed my gaze and wiping his face, trying
to calm down.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Aha!
Hahahahahaha!</span></span><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">That's
right. I still have this treasure sword, the Grandius!</span></span><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">This is the national
treasure of the elves' country! This holy sword was given to the previous
Master by the heavens, the Grandius! If you touch it, you will be destroyed by
battle-class magic. Your magic power and physical strength are not infinite!</span></span><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I wonder how long you can
avoid them!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
am not the only one who gasped at his words, but Nemumu and Gold gasped as
well.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Instead
of the holy sword, we react to the word 'Master'.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"......
You said 'Master'!?"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Do
you know about the Master......?"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"Ahahahahaha!</span></span><span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span></span><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">That is right, I am the one
chosen by the world to be the Master! I have been chosen by the Goddess!"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"To
be precise, I am a descendant of the Master. A future hero called Sub-Master. A
hero with the God's blood flowing in my body! I'm a noble being, different from
you trashy humans! Too cocky! You're too cocky! Know your place! Humans! </span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"......
'Sub-Master'? Not 'Master'?"</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
came here and got some new information.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">It
seems that the descendants of 'Master' are called 'Sub-Master'.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Apparently,
he is not the Master, but he seems to be related to it.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">Still,
he is a valuable information source.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">"...
He isn't the "Master", but he's still a valuable information source.
I'll change my plan. I won't kill him here. I'll still kill him, but... I will
bring this guy to Naraku."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span face="&quot;Arial&quot;,&quot;sans-serif&quot;" class="calibre2">I
quickly made a decision and took a position with a wand in my hand. </span></span></p></div>
