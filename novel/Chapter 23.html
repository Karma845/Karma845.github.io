<h3>Chapter 23 &#8211; Finally, we have become stronger in the underground dungeon! Evil Dragon Subjugation! ②</h3>

<p>“&#8212; the strongest villager in the world.”</p>
<p>The moment I said those words- Amanta’s fingernails grew out.</p>
<p>It was similar to a cat baring her claws, in other words, she entered a combat ready state.</p>
<p>I noticed a purple liquid dripped down from her nails, and so I let out a bitter smile.</p>
<p>“I see. Instead of a dragon, you’re more like a poisonous snake. But ‘Evil Dragon’ sounds more intimidating, so you&#8217;re that kind of existence, huh?”</p>
<p>A droplet falls onto the ground.</p>
<p>The grass within its radius of a few meters dried up, Amanta had let out a gleeful laugh.</p>
<p>“Ufufu. Hey, hey big brother? Big brother? On a beautiful rose is a sharp thorn, y’know?.”</p>
<p>“Rather than a rose… You look more like a carnivorous plant. If one gets too close, one could get hurt, so if I can help it, I wouldn’t want to touch you.”</p>
<p>Actually, she looked like a ten year old gothic lolita.</p>
<p>If you touched her in modern Japan, you’d have the police knocking at your door.</p>
<p>At this point, Amanta laughed again.</p>
<p>&#8212;Confirming Cordelia’s safety behind me, I gave out a happy smile.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, big brother? Big brother?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“You know big sister? You know big sister?”</p>
<p>“So what?”</p>
<p>“&#8212; said she had a person she liked! Hey, hey, big brother? Big brother?”</p>
<p>“&#8230; What?”</p>
<p>“Could it be? Could it be? The one big sister likes is &#8211; big bro -”</p>
<p>Instant acceleration.</p>
<p>The opponent was a loli, but that’s only going by the appearance.</p>
<p>She was in fact a loli-baba.</p>
<p>In other words, as expected, she was annoying.</p>
<p>Unsheathing my sword from my back, I slashed down onto Amanta’s head.</p>
<p>“Kyahaha~! Kyahahaha~!”</p>
<p>Amanta laughed as though she was having fun and avoids my sword.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, big brother? Big brother? Where did you get this sword? Where did you get it?”</p>
<p>She looked like a really clumsy kid.</p>
<p>First a kick towards my lower half.</p>
<p>I backstepped in order to dodge, but she quickly closed the distance.</p>
<p>Next she sent a kick towards my head- as a feint, and turned it into a kick towards my abdomen half way through.</p>
<p>&#8212; Brazilian kick.</p>
<p>Aren’t you quite capable… Blonde gothic loli.</p>
<p>“Goof…!”</p>
<p>I got hit on my flank.</p>
<p>My internal organs tremble due to the shock, I couldn’t joke about this.</p>
<p>&#8212; Skill: Indomitability activated.</p>
<p>Without falling, I somehow managed to return a wide swing towards Amanta.</p>
<p>And then, just as my sword slash was completed, Amanta elegantly showed an effortless smile.</p>
<p>“Hey, hey, big brother? Big brother? That sword, maybe… Is a really rare sword, right? It’s a strong sword, right? Isn’t that a sword a veteran hero should be wielding? Isn’t it?”</p>
<p>Amanta continued as she easily dodges the sword slashes.</p>
<p>“But you see, but you see? This sword seems to be a bit too much for big brother, and doesn’t seem to suit you, right? Isn’t that right?”</p>
<p>Her ridiculous laughter rang through the forest.</p>
<p>Suddenly behind me, Cordelia took a stance with her sword herself and said.</p>
<p>“Lute? You truly did become stronger. Well, you’ve become really strong. I understand that, and I feel you’re at a level able to fight alongside me.”</p>
<p>“That’s, well, thanks.”</p>
<p>“I respect you. After all you &#8211; to a somewhat grown hero… You are pretty much on the same level as me. How a simple villager has managed to fight his way here &#8211; Seriously, you as a person are…”</p>
<p>Then, Cordelia walked towards my back.</p>
<p>“Lute? Let’s do this together? If it’s the me right now and you right now, even if the opponent is a calamity class monster &#8211; there’s nothing we can’t do.”</p>
<p>When I turned around, Cordelia was laughing happily.</p>
<p>“Well, when I think back on it… I thought you’d deal with it on your own though. The opponent can be counted as a calamity grade monster… As expected, that would be too reck-”</p>
<p>At that point, I shrugged my shoulders.</p>
<p>“The two of us teaming up together for just an Evil Dragon? Why?”</p>
<p>Eh… Cordelia’s mouth opened.</p>
<p>“Because I watched the battle just a while ago? Saying you’ll take her down alone is reckless, rather, it’s impossible.”</p>
<p>I see, and I let out a smile.</p>
<p>“You know, Cordelia?”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>After a sigh, I opened my mouth.</p>
<p>“ -In the encounter earlier… I wasn’t using Body Reinforcement.”</p>
<p>“&#8230; Heh?”</p>
<p>Cordelia froze.</p>
<p>“Like I said, I didn’t use Body reinforcement.”</p>
<p>Cordelia remained frozen as though she didn’t understand what I said.</p>
<p>“&#8230;What is it?”</p>
<p>“Body reinforcement is the most basic and the most powerful status enhancing skill, correct?”</p>
<p>“Yeah that’s true, it’s the most essential skill for a close range fighter, a swordsman not using it is like… a magician not using magic.”</p>
<p>“And, if you use Body reinforcement, your close combat stats double, right?”</p>
<p>At this point, Cordelia made an irritated expression.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I really don’t understand. That’s why… What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, I use a lot of other reinforcement skills. But for training, I’m making it a point not to use the most basic, most obvious skill. This time, it was Body reinforcement…”</p>
<p>Cordelia’s face turned pale.</p>
<p>Well, even I know how much this diverts from common sense.</p>
<p>“Hey, you? Are you saying that seriously?”</p>
<p>“Ah, so basically, If I get serious, I’d be twice as strong as right now.”</p>
<p>Without reading the atmosphere, Amanta rushed towards me.</p>
<p>“Big brother? Big brother? Didn’t you learn not to look away in the middle of a battle? Didn’t you?”</p>
<p>Body reinforcement activated.</p>
<p>Attack power, defensive power, movement ability, all of them were doubled.</p>
<p>Everything around me seemed to move in slow motion.</p>
<p>And the attack I brought out &#8211;</p>
<p>&#8212; Back fist.</p>
<p>Two of her front teeth were crushed, and Amanta, who couldn’t react, was sent flying backwards at an alarming speed.</p>
<p>She crashed through a massive tree, but her momentum didn’t stop.</p>
<p>After crashing through ten trees, destroying a lot of nature around us and being sent twenty meters back, she finally came to a halt.</p>
<p>Unable to believe it, Amanta puts her fingers into her own mouth.</p>
<p>And then, confirming the blood that flowed without stopping, she hardened.</p>
<p>Ten seconds, twenty seconds and then thirty seconds.</p>
<p>Finally recognizing the situation, Amanta who had frozen up, let out a word.</p>
<p>“&#8230; Huh?”</p>
