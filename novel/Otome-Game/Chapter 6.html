						 <h2 class="wp-block-heading">Chapter 6 – Twisted Event&nbsp;&nbsp; First Part</h2> <p>Outdoor field trip for the new first year students, it was a custom of the sorcery academy. Based from what I only heard, this field trip or sightseeing was being held every year, so it wasn’t that unusual of an event.</p> <p>The information about the event still hadn’t been announced to the students because children of high ranked nobles would participate in this event. There was a risk of kidnapping or attack that had to be considered, so the event organizer was hiding the event details until the last moment. That was what I was told.</p> <p>「It can’t be helped that Onii-sama has to participate because of his standing, but I didn’t expect for uncle to also come along. The matter of him becoming a teacher also only got told to me after the fact……if only I could stop him.」</p> <p>Elena and I were comparing information while drinking tea at the terrace of her mansion. Elena pressed her finger on her forehead as though she had a headache when she heard about Amor’s case.</p> <p>「I don’t think uncle will try anything strange out of nowhere but, you should be careful too Aria. That person is basing his decision on something stupid like “personal emotion” and he might try to remove you from my side because of that.」</p> <p>「Is it possible to overturn the king’s decree? By that person?」</p> <p>「Depending on the method, like grasping the person’s weakness, or with brute force……」</p> <p>Elena stopped at that point and once more looked at me who was dressed in maid uniform. She smiled wryly.</p> <p>「Both ways will be pointless against you won’t they?」</p> <p>Elena ended the talk in that note. I poured more tea into her teacup while the butler Joseph spoke up.</p> <p>「Elena-sama, there is an additional information that has just arrived. I believe that it might be about that matter.」</p> <p>「What could it be, gramps.」</p> <p>「The location of the field trip this time will be quite far from the capital, and so it is believed that the ladies from high ranked noble houses will decline to participate. In that case, your highness as a royalty will be put in the same group with the young ladies who don’t possess their own carriage, but a young noble will also get fitted into there.」</p> <p>「……Who is it?」</p> <p>Elena guessed the “unsaid words” from that sentence and put on an elegant smile that also radiated dreadfulness.</p> <p>「It’s Nathanital-sama, the grandson of the head priest of the royal capital’s holy church who is a baron of the robe. His endorser is his highness the royal brother.」</p> <p>「My……」</p> <p>The head priest of the holy church held baron rank. My “knowledge” couldn’t tell me whether that was a high or low position, but based on Elena’s expression, it shouldn’t be wrong for me to consider that baron of the robe was higher positioned than a normal baron.</p> <p>「If it’s that person, then I remember playing with him when visiting the shrine of the holy church when I was little.」</p> <p>Elena sighed while recalling the past.</p> <p>「That person was so adorable that at first I thought he was a young lady from somewhere, so I put on a flower crown on his head. He cried because of that. Even so……I am aware how uncle is a pious devotee of the holy church but, I wonder what he is thinking this time?」</p> <p>Elena’s muttering ended up with a questioning tone but, she must have guessed the reason to some degree based on her annoyed expression.</p> <p>I’m guessing that he was trying to push Elena into the church in order to isolate her from the conflict of this vulgar world, or if baron of the robe was in reality a position that was equal to count rank just like I imagined, there was also the possibility that this move was designed to direct Elena to marry out of the royal family.</p> <p>Furthermore this was just Amor’s arbitrary decision that ignored Elena and the king’s opinion.</p> <p>「Let’s be on our guard for now. It’s really troubling how the thinking and action of those who are moving based on their emotion are so hard to predict……」</p> <p>Joseph and Chloe and I nodded at Elena’s words.</p> <p>The number of allies who Elena could be herself with was really small. Three were only these two who had been taking care of her since she was born, and then there was Sera who she brought as servant even into the dungeon I guess.</p> <p>Perhaps she was putting a suspicious person like me on her side was also because of that. For the sake of Elena who couldn’t even genuinely rely on her own parents and big brother, I swore to myself once more that I would at least protect her heart.</p> <p>「……Is the preparat<em>ion</em>, fin<em>ish</em>ed?」</p> <p>Inside a dark forest, a person who seemed to be a female clad in black cloth all over her body was talking with shaky common language that had extremely heavy accent. She was replied to by the voice of another female who was also similarly covered all over her body to hide her identity.</p> <p>「I wish you’ll trust us already……. Their plan to revolt still hasn’t changed, and our force is also making preparation so don’t worry.」</p> <p>The two were working together in cooperation, but they weren’t “comrades” by all means.</p> <p>The two belonged to different organizations. Their objective was different. Even so what they had to do was the same, which was why they were working together.</p> <p>「We’re doing what needed to be done. Make yourself be capable to use that. With your status, it should produce even greater force compared to all the other weapons you have used until now.」</p> <p>「……got it.」</p> <p>The woman in black didn’t say much and swung the magic iron chain. It resulted in a deep gash on a tree. Just how much strength was used to cause something like that?</p> <p>The other woman who gave her that weapon and taught her how to use it took out a thin mythril chain that was for her use. Her eye that was the only part of her body that was exposed had burn scar around it. That eye was blazing with hatred.</p> <p>(“Ash Crowned”……I’ll kill you no matter what!)</p> <p>***</p> <p>Like that one month passed without any particular problem. Around the time when the sign of spring started to appear faintly, it was announced that there would be a field trip to observe a knight order’s exercise that was intended for middle ranked nobles and above.</p> <p>The exercise would be carried out at a grass plain located in the middle of a territory under the royal family’s direct control and the territory of Marquis Wankarl. It was an area that didn’t belong to either territory. It was a place that was unsuited for people to live in because there wasn’t anything there to block the sea breeze, but in exchange there would be nobody who complained if an exercise was held there.</p> <p>The female students were free to choose whether to participate or not. As expected, someone who wanted to go to a place that had no inn and in a distance that would need three days of travel in carriage to arrive at was rare. There were only several people among all the female students who decided to participate.</p> <p>Then those few female students should be grouped together……that was the suggestion that the academy made, but it was taken back because Carla announced that she would participate.</p> <p>At the day of the trip, Elena and I and two other female students, and then the grandson of the head priest Nathanital were gathering in order to ride on the same carriage.</p> <p>That Nathanital was shorter than even Elena. He was a boy with a face that really looked like a girl, but it seemed the person himself had a feeling of inferiority because of his short height and girly face. He was making a displeased expression that he had to head to the destination in the same carriage with the female students.</p> <p>It would be great if nothing troublesome happened……I was thinking like that while bringing Elena’s luggage into the carriage. It was then an unknown presence approached from behind.</p> <p>「Pardon me. Am I not mistaken that you are Lady Aria?」</p> <p>「Do you have a business with me?」</p> <p>I greeted the man who looked like a knight with a bow as a high class maid. That young man then smiled brightly with his handsome face.</p> <p>「I wish to talk with you for a bit about the security during the trip. Can I ask for a little bit of your time?」</p> <p>「……I understand.」</p> <p>.</p> <p>That young knight was apparently the leader of the second knight order’s first company that was in charge of the princess’s security. But, what kind of business someone like that could have with me? The fact that I was the princess’s bodyguard shouldn’t be a public knowledge, but did he learn about it from somewhere?</p> <p>That company leader escorted me toward young knights who seemed to be his subordinate. They would be in charge of security after this so naturally they were fully armored. The location was in a building inside the academy that seemed to be used as the knights’ station.</p> <p>「It will be the time for departure soon, so there should be little time though?」</p> <p>「We won’t take that long. The men of the second knight order are also helping out with the preparation of her highness’s carriage, so I believe there won’t be any problem.」</p> <p>The company leader smiled wryly in apology. We were sitting while facing each other in the station’s reception room.</p> <p>「Let me pour you tea. I managed to get my hand on good tea leaves from Carlfan Empire. I’ll brew it together with sugar and spices just like how it’s prepared in its place of origin. The taste is a bit quirky, but it’s delicious when you get used to it.」</p> <p>「Aren’t we going to talk about the security during the trip?」</p> <p>I said that without showing any emotion. The young man shrugged a little in respond to my attitude.</p> <p>「Her highness too shouldn’t be angry just because we’re taking a bit of time to enjoy tea correct? Also it’s rude of me to not have introduced myself. My name is Joey. If possible, I too wish to listen to the story of the adventurer who managed to join the famous “Rainbow Sword” in such young age.」</p> <p>「……Where did you hear that?」</p> <p>I calmly asked him without any change in my tone and also without applying any pressure. Perhaps he sensed something from that me. The young man who introduced himself as Joey was at a loss for word for a moment.</p> <p>「……It was from his highness the royal brother. His highness also told me how you are an extremely skilled scout who have also reached rank 4.」</p> <p>「I see.」</p> <p>That man again……it was troublesome that someone of such high status and a lot of free time was carelessly leaking out information.</p> <p>After that Joey’s subordinate entered with a tea that gave off a particular aroma. I sipped at the edge of the cup that was presented to me before quietly returning it on the table. Then I turned a half closed gaze toward the knight.</p> <p>「And, are we going to talk already?」</p> <p>「You still haven’t even drank most of the tea. Or perhaps I should also prepare a light snack to go along with it?」</p> <p>「Are you ordered to keep me in place like that?」</p> <p>「What are you……」</p> <p>Joey smiled as though my words were said jokingly, but a faint killing intent formed inside him at that moment. I could also hear a faint commotion outside the room.</p> <p>I paid that no mind and lightly flicked on the cup before me.</p> <p>「What is your intention with serving <em>sleeping drug</em> to the princess’s bodyguard?」</p> <p>*Bam!*</p> <p>The door got opened loudly at the same time with those words. Then Joey’s subordinates rushed inside.</p> <p>Joey himself also unsheathed his sword and stood in front of his subordinates. He pointed its tip toward me who was standing up and smiled mockingly.</p> <p>「So you have poison resistance……looks like I underestimated you too much on the account of you being a girl. We are ordered to not kill her highness’s people if possible. Even though you’re a rank 4, there’s nothing a scout can do against knights inside a cramped place like this right? Let’s have you surrender quietly.」</p> <p>Scout was considered as weaker in combat power compared to warrior or sorcerer even if they had the same rank. If a warrior and a scout actually fought each other head on, it would be the warrior who won most of the time.</p> <p>「Your target is the princess?」</p> <p>Joey frowned slightly when I asked that question.</p> <p>「We too are knights of the kingdom. We will never hurt her highness. For the sake of our objective, we wish for his highness the crown prince to withdraw his claim of the throne, and a “place for persuasion” has been prepared in order for us to ask her highness to become the new leader of our alliance. You’re in the way of that. I’ll have you surrender here.」</p> <p>「……Noble faction huh. Whose order is this?」</p> <p>The atmosphere of the knights changed from my words.</p> <p>「Do it……I don’t mind even if you cut her limbs!」</p> <p>Joey raised his voice. The knights moved into action.</p> <p>But, I took a step forward in that instant and took out my black knife from my <ruby>Storage<rp>(</rp><rt>Shadow Storage</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby>. With that I tore his throat while he was unable to react.</p> <p>「I’ll eliminate the enemy on Elena’s way.」</p> <p>***</p> <p>「Your highness, the preparation for our departure is finished. The scheduled time for our departure is also fast approaching. We should depart soon.」</p> <p>The fifth company of the second knight order had arrived to guard the princess. It was the company leader who said that to Elena.</p> <p>「It’s already that time? My attendant, the female student called Aria still hasn’t returned. Can’t we wait until she come back here?」</p> <p>The exercise observation this time was intended for male students of baron house and higher that owned a territory. Aria who was an adopted daughter of a baronet house didn’t have the qualification to participate in it, but high ranked noble with rank higher than count was permitted to bring one attendant with them, so Elena naturally chose Aria for that role.</p> <p>Originally a royalty like Elena should be forced to bring multiple bodyguards with her because of her position, but Elena insisted in being an example for other students, and a company of around forty knights, selected from among the elites of the second knight order came as her guard, so in the end she was allowed to bring Aria alone as her personal guard.</p> <p>Originally a company should be composed of 200 members including common soldiers, but this time only around 40 knights riding on horse came because they would travel using carriage. That number should be enough to serve in the role of guard for several days.</p> <p>When Elena who was sitting on a bench that was placed outside answered like that, the company leader put on a dry smile as though to remonstrate an unreasonable kid.</p> <p>「Your highness……. If it pleases you, please also think of the other students who have been waiting inside the carriage. Besides if your highness is worried about the student called Aria, I will leave behind another carriage here so she can quickly catch up with us when she arrived. I believe that she will be able to quickly join your highness again at the resting place midway.」</p> <p>「Is that so……」</p> <p>These knights were chosen from among all the knights in the second knight order to be the princess’s guards. They were elites among elites.</p> <p>All squad leaders were rank 3. And this company leader Ludger was especially a rank 4 knight, one of the few in the knight order even though he was still at his early thirty. He was also the head of a baron house. Even Elena couldn’t ignore his word so easily.</p> <p>「Very well. Then I ask you to guard us well during this trip. I also ask you to make the arrangement so Aria will be able to join up with us within today.」</p> <p>「It will be as your highness command. Please leave it to me.」</p> <p>The situation was somewhat suspicious, but her quality as a royalty would also be questioned if she was acting too paranoid, Besides she couldn’t obstinately order the whole group to [wait] after the other students got brought up.</p> <p>Like that Elena left behind Aria who was her shield and her sword. She got into the royal family carriage that was prepared for her. Inside, there were the young ladies from a baron house and a viscount house that didn’t have male child……and also the boy who was the grandson of the head priest who held the rank of baron of the robe.</p> <p>「Long time no see, Nathanital. Is the head priest in good health?」</p> <p>「Y-yes, your highness! My grandfather is doing well-!」</p> <p>The boy was as petite and adorable as the other young ladies. He replied nervously when Elena had a small talk with him.</p> <p>「Putting that aside……you don’t have any attendant with you it seems.」</p> <p>Baron of the robe was a position that was related to religion, so that rank wasn’t accompanied with a territory. But the holder of that rank received a treatment that was equal to a house of count. If Nathanital demanded it then it would be possible for him to bring an attendant, but he refused to do that.</p> <p>「Yes-, I’m a child of the church before I am a noble-, so I’ve been raised to be able to take care of myself!」</p> <p>「……I see.」</p> <p>What he said was splendid, but from his expression and tone, it could be seen how he had been dyed with the ideal of the church that despised the worldly noble. Elena controlled herself so her disappointment wouldn’t show from her expression while giving up having more conversation than this with Nathanital.</p> <p>The other young ladies who sensed that atmosphere also kept their mouth closed. The carriage kept running while the inside was staying silent. Elena who had nothing to do turned her gaze to outside the window and noticed that the carriage that should be running from the south of the capital to the east was actually running inside a forest.</p> <p>「Where is this carriage heading to? From the sun’s position, it seems to be heading to the south though?」</p> <p>Elena asked that question to the carriage driver from the small window installed at the front part. The soldier who drove the carriage then called out to someone else, opened the door of the carriage while keeping it running, then Ludger got inside from his horse that was running in parallel.</p> <p>「Pardon me, your highness. Can I ask you to please stay quiet?」</p> <p>「You……tsu」</p> <p>「We will bring your highness to a certain place from here. I will guarantee the safety of the other students as long as your highness stay obedient.」</p> <p>***</p> <p>「What!?」</p> <p>「Commander!」</p> <p>「How dare you do that to Joey!」</p> <p>Joey whose throat was torn up instantly crumpled down. The other knights directed their fury toward me who was holding a bloody black knife.</p> <p>「You will pay-!」</p> <p>Most likely these knights weren’t just his coworkers but also friends. A knight who looked like he was the same age with Joey thrust with his sword. I used minimalist movement to dodge the tip while stabbing his throat with my black knife.</p> <p>「Shit-! Don’t let your guard down!」</p> <p>「A scout won’t be able to do anything when surrounded-, don’t let her get away!」</p> <p>「Ou!」</p> <p>Their combat strength was around 200──they could be considered as upper rank 2.</p> <p>Their company leader Joey was around rank 3. That Joey and his friends didn’t withdraw even after I killed some of them was partly because of anger, but mostly because they were still confident of their superiority.</p> <p>When many people fought inside a cramped space like inside a room, the side wearing armor and shield would have the advantage because of the limited space for dodging. Even I would first take distance when fighting against warriors of the same rank outdoor. I would then separate them before aiming to take them down one by one.</p> <p>These knights thought that they could win against me even though there was difference in our rank because they felt safe from wearing armor, and because of my appearance as a slender girl. That was my thought.</p> <p>But, they were mistaken in their premise. Dodging wasn’t impossible just because the place was cramped.</p> <p>「Wha-!?」</p> <p>Even if it looked like they were attacking at the same time, there was still difference in speed from each other. I used my knife to parry the tip of the sword that reached me first, put one hand on the head of that knight who charged at me, and jumped to dodge to the ceiling.</p> <p>My posture became upside down and I landed on the quite high ceiling. Then I rotated my whole body while twisting the head of the knight that my hand was still grabbing. My skirt fluttered and I pulled out the black dagger attached on my thigh, then I stabbed my knife and dagger to the side of the heads of the knights at my right and left. Then I landed back on the floor with my skirt fluttering gently.</p> <p>「I-impossible……」</p> <p>「How can a scout be this strong!?」</p> <p>「She’s just a little girl-!」</p> <p>Three remaining. Put your life on the line if you want to close the gap between ranks. Besides it’s unfortunate but, although I’m a scout type adventurer, I wasn’t really a “scout” deep down.</p> <p>Although the knights were clad in armor, it wasn’t the full plate armor that they usually wore in battlefield, but just light armor that consisted of chain mail and things like breast plate or arm protectors slapped over it.</p> <p>An “assassin” could kill their target if they showed their bare skin even if it was only a little.</p> <p>Before they could recover from their panic, I slid into the gap between them and stabbed my dagger to a knight’s flank while tearing the neck of another knight with my knife.</p> <p>I jumped over that knight and kicked on the ceiling, then using that momentum I smashed in the face of the knight behind them using the hard heel of my loafer.</p> <p>「You’re the last one. Where’re you planning to bring her highness to?」</p> <p>「Dammit-」</p> <p>When I pointed my blood soaked knife at him, the knight who had my dagger planted deeply into his side glared at me while sweating waterfall and kneeling on the floor.</p> <p>「Don’t……look down on us-, the conviction of us knights of the noble faction who grief for this country’s future will never break no matter what kind of torture──」</p> <p>「Then die.」</p> <p>I horizontally slashed the knight’s neck while he was in the middle of talking, taking his life.</p> <p>If he said he wouldn’t talk even under torture then it would be a waste of time to keep talking with him. I didn’t know what kind of conviction these knights from noble faction had, but if they were still knight, they should be resolved for even death penalty now that they had laid their hand on a royalty.</p> <p>Even if I somehow managed to extract information from someone with such resolve, I had no time to confirm whether that information was accurate or not.</p> <p>「Elena……」</p> <p>I checked Joey’s body just in case he had something on him before going after Elena.</p> <p>.</p> <p>When I returned to the gathering place, the carriage was already gone just as I thought. I searched the faint track that was left on the ground before running toward the direction where the carriage seemed to being.</p> <p>I arrived at the south gate of the academy and confirmed that Elena’s carriage had passed through here. I showed the guard there a badge that I was related to the royal family and asked him to deliver a message to the <ruby>butler<rp>(</rp><rt>Joseph</rt><rp>)</rp></ruby> at Elena’s mansion, then I immediately started following the track once more. Midway the track entered a forest and from there it split into multiple tracks. I couldn’t follow it any further than this.</p> <p>Which way did they go? Have I missed the track on my way here?</p> <p>I was thinking like that while sharpening my Detection until the very limit to search the surrounding. Then I suddenly noticed the “gaze” from faraway that was looking at me, one that didn’t belong to human.</p> <p>I turned around and focused my eyes into the darkness of the forest──</p> <p>「……Nero?」</p> <p>『…………』</p> <p>The mythical beast Coeurl showed itself from inside dark forest as though it was oozing out from the darkness. Was this a coincidence or inevitability? The Coeurl who I named Nero silently stared still at me to ascertain something.</p> <p>Inside the slightly gloomy forest in the morning, we were staring at each other as though to assess the other side. I quietly pointed my black dagger toward Nero.</p> <p>「I’ll take you on if you get in my way. And if not then──」</p> <p>*Gin!*</p> <p>Nero’s whip-like whisker flew out from the darkness in that moment and clashed against my knife. I switched posture and thrust my dagger between Nero’s eyes.</p> <p>「Lend me your strength, Nero.」</p> <p>&lt;──right──&gt;</p> <p>Nero gave such answer and approached until my side with nimbleness that was unimaginable from such large body. It brought its nose close to the ground where I became unable to differentiate the right track.</p> <p>「……You can find the right one?」</p> <p>『Gaa……』</p> <p><em>Why can’t you? </em>It felt like it was saying that to me.</p> <p>Why was Nero allying itself with me? Did it recognize me in that fight?</p> <p>Nero called me 『moon』 when we parted. The spirit also called me 『the child of moon rose』. Carla said that 『I was like a moon so she reached her hand toward me』.</p> <p>I wonder how was “I” reflected in the world that they were seeing……?</p> <p>「Let’s go, Nero.」</p> <p>&lt;──right──moon──&gt;</p> <p>.</p> <p>Nero started moving and following the track while I ran at its side. We continued like that for a while before we ran into a scene of two knights in the process of pushing&nbsp; female students in uniform into a carriage.</p> <p>「Nero」</p> <p>『GAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAA!』</p> <p>Nero’s roar startled the knights and they turned around. I took advantage of that opening and gave an order to the female students.</p> <p>「Duck!」</p> <p>The knights were at a loss for a moment from the voice of me who was their <em>enemy. </em>The two female students meanwhile were reflexively ducking.</p> <p>I was using body strengthening, and using pendulum’s string I jumped on a tree. The knights reflexively followed me with their eyes. Nero who didn’t slow down at all slammed at them with its large body.</p> <p>「Disappear」</p> <p>The knights got thrown to the air. I also whirled through the air and wrapped two pendulums around their necks. Then I kicked on empty air to rotate myself while using the centrifugal force to snap the knights’ necks. Then I immediately unwrapped the string and threw them into the forest around us.</p> <p>「……Are you two alright?」</p> <p>「Y-yes.」</p> <p>These female students should be the young ladies who departed in the same carriage with us. Why were the two of them here? The young lady from viscount house was replying even while looking scared at a huge beast like Nero. Then the young lady from baron house gasped and spoke up.</p> <p>「Her highness and the male student from the church are still being captured! They said that we are just in the way……」</p> <p>「Where are they taking Elena-sama to?」</p> <p>「Ahead from here-, they shouldn’t be that far yet from here-!」</p> <p>I turned my gaze toward the direction the baron daughter was pointing before facing the two once more.</p> <p>「You two stay inside that carriage. Reinforcement should arrive later.」</p> <p>「Yes-」</p> <p>「Please save the princess-!」</p> <p>I nodded to them and called out to my back without even turning around.</p> <p>「We’re going Nero」</p> <p>『Gaaa』</p> <p>.</p> <p>The girls saw us off while clasping their hands together in prayer. We broke into a run once more in order to hurry ahead.</p> <p>Midway I climbed a tree and jumped from branch to branch while surveying my surrounding to make sure that I wouldn’t miss anything. Then midway I saw an open clearing inside the forest with a large ten that was usually used in battlefield being erected there. I changed direction to there──</p> <p>「Tsu!」</p> <p>*Gin!*</p> <p>Nero used its whisker to deflect the arrow that came flying this way.</p> <p>It seemed they had posted an archer as lookout. As expected they were different from bandits. I calculated the shooter’s position from the direction the arrow flew from and returned fire using a normal crossbow loaded with poison arrow that I took out from my Storage.</p> <p>The archer fell from the tree. It seemed that my arrow luckily hit him. But, I couldn’t launch a surprise attack now after counterattacking their surprise attack. We leaped out from the trees to the ground, showing ourselves to the knights near the tent.</p> <p>「Aria-!」</p> <p>「Elena……you’re safe.」</p> <p>There wasn’t even any time to feel relieve hearing that voice. The knights drew out their weapons warily toward Nero and me and formed formation.</p> <p>Rank 3 knights who seemed to be as strong as Joey were surrounding Elena and the boy called Nathanital while pointing their weapons toward us. Then a man at his thirty who seemed to be the company commander and a middle-aged man who seemed to be a noble quietly stepped forward while being protected by the knights.</p> <p>「As expected from “Rainbow Sword”. So you defeated my subordinates in that age and caught up with us already……」</p> <p>「Ludger-, what is that beast!? Is the academy keeping that kind of monster!?」</p> <p>「No, Viscount Savoie. Most likely it’s a monster that got tamed by that adventurer girl……Lady Aria, I ask you to send off that beast from this place. If you refuse, an injury that cannot be healed will be left behind on the face of that boy over there.」</p> <p>「Hih……」</p> <p>Nathanital got a short sword pointed to his face by the knight who was holding him. He let out a small scream with a fearful look. Then the knight captain called Ludger spoke up again.</p> <p>「You too should understand this situation if you are the princess’s bodyguard. Throw away your weapon and surrender. To be honest, I don’t want to turn a famous adventurer party into enemy. I shall promise you a greater amount of payment if you continue to guard the princess at our side.」</p> <p>「……Nero, leave.」</p> <p>『…………』</p> <p>Nero understood the situation and returned to the forest when I spoke to it. Then it hid itself.</p> <p>Besides I had heard the name of that Viscount Savoie somewhere. I believed it was Sera who told me. He should be a noble from the noble faction who was famous for being radical.</p> <p>The noble faction that had stayed quiet for some time was starting to move again……. That Viscount Savoie smiled in relief seeing Nero gone and talked to the captured Elena.</p> <p>「That was a bit unexpected but, can I ask your highness to also tell your bodyguard to surrender? We have no intention to do anything to your highness if your highness proof obedient, but we will have to rely on <em>this </em>if your highness keeps acting rebellious like that.」</p> <p>「…………」</p> <p>Viscount Savoie shook a small black bottle with his fingers to show it off. It caused Elena’s face to twist in disgust.</p> <p>That bottle……I once saw it at master’s place. The bottle was empty, but that should be a sealed bottle that contained special medicine that the [evil race] used.</p> <p>I didn’t know what kind of drug it was, but guessing from Elena’s expression, it must be something like a paralyzing medicine to rob the consumer of their free will and reduced them into a state that was just a step shy from being an invalid. It seemed the intention of the knights was to have Elena as their alliance leader, but the that didn’t mean the intention of the noble faction was just that. At the worst case they could just turn Elena into an invalid to be used as a threat against the young second prince.</p> <p>What could I do to save her? If it was just Elena herself, would I be able to escape from here while carrying her?</p> <p>Even if I used Iron Rose, I would run out of mana midway and I would have to fight the pursuer in such weakened state.</p> <p>Would Nero allow Elena to get on its back? Even before that, would Elena accept abandoning Nathanital to his fate?</p> <p>Even if Nero allowed Elena who was close to me to ride on its back, Nero definitely wouldn’t tolerate Nathanital who could only tremble in fear in this situation.</p> <p>Could I fight while protecting Elena against this many opponents……?</p> <p>But, Elena had resolved herself first before I could decide on my answer and smiled softly.</p> <p>「Aria……thank you for coming. I’m happy.」</p> <p>Elena then let out a sigh before looking straight into my eyes.</p> <p>「You can do as you like from here. Things will become difficult if you come with me. Even if it’s just you, you at least should live “free”……」</p> <p>「……Elena」</p> <p>She lived for the sake of the kingdom’s people. Even though she had risked her life to clear a dungeon and had her body healed, she still tried to become a queen and lived for the kingdom’s sake.</p> <p>These guys would even trample Elena’s feeling just to make their wish come true. Viscount Savoie frowned even at Elena’s small wish to avoid involving me.</p> <p>「Your highness……it’s troubling for you to say something so selfish. Such skilled bodyguard who can handle that kind of monster will serve as a good fighting force. Please give the right order here, your highness.」</p> <p>「You……-!」</p> <p>Elena bristled up from those words that went too far. Even Ludger was frowning.</p> <p>Aa, I see……</p> <p>Elena was resolved even if the result that she obtained was “death”.</p> <p>So it was me who was lacking determination.</p> <p>Then I too……would act “free” just as she wished for.</p> <p>「……Iron Rose……」</p> <p>.</p> <p>My figure vanished from their sight in that moment.</p> <p>『──!?』</p> <p>My body left residues of light behind as though they were wings while I slashed the necks of the knights who were holding Elena and Nathanital with super fast movement. Then I held Elena under my right arm and grabbed Nathanital’s collar with my left hand before swooping down on a spot that was at a distance from the knights.</p> <p>「Aria……」</p> <p>「Elena, I’ll do as I please.」</p> <p>My ashen iron colored hair that looked like scorching iron fluttered as I looked down on Viscount Savoie and the knights who were looking astonished. Then I proclaimed with a voice that was heavy like iron.</p> <p>.</p> <p>「I’ll annihilate all of you here.」</p>
