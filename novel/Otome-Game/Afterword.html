<h2 class="wp-block-heading">Afterword</h2> <p>Nice to meet you readers who are here for the first time. Long time no see to the rest. This is Harunohi Biyori.</p> <p>Finally the fifth volume that is the start of part two get released. It’s the best part of otome game, the [academy arc]!</p> <p>Well, the academy arc in the tale that I wrote often got comment like [Eh? Academy arc?], so I was worrying until the last moment whether it’s really alright to name part 2 as academy arc, but the rough draft of the previous notice mentioned academy arc, so I resolved myself for it. This is the academy arc!</p> <p>Even so among those who had finished reading the WN until the end, many ended up having this kind of impression.</p> <p>[Eh? Academy arc?]……they said.</p> <p>I wrote in the afterword of the fourth volume that I’ll increase the academy life’s content. One of the reasons for that is this.</p> <p>But in reality when I started writing, there were many parts in the WN that were filled with explanation and were difficult to read, so I revised them, switched the timeline of some scenes to make the book easier to read and so that the tale can progress smoothly, and the result! The story progress became a fast paced development, and the warm and snug academy life was……eh? They got in the way. And so, I ended up omitting them in the end…….</p> <p>In exchange, I consolidated those parts in the short story, and I added the academy story surrounding Aria in the LN’s exclusive content. Please forgive me with those.</p> <p>.</p> <p>The fake heroine-chan is also starting to brazenly maneuver behind the scene with the story entering the otome game’s main part.</p> <p>Well, there isn’t any character that isn’t maneuvering behind the scene though. Until now it was a tale of brutal survival battle where the main factor was Aria surviving, but here the sordid parts that sometimes showed glimpses in between came out all at once. The romantic situation was in bits and pieces……that’s how the story is (lol)</p> <p>Carla is shining bright when it come to secret maneuver. Of course, Clara and Elena are also giving their all to do their own plans for their own survival.</p> <p>It might be misleading if I write it like this but, the first part was the preparation arc for Aria to become stronger.</p> <p>In the second part she have to face organization and group a lot more. There the strength that Aria had tempered until then would be put into display.</p> <p>Won’t the thrill go down like that? You might ask, but there will be proper formidable enemies too. But the difference from before is that other than the thrill from Aria getting into a pinch, there will be the excitement of her being “unrivalled” mixed in too.</p> <p>This opinion might differ depending on the person but, in shounen manga and the like, I really hate a development when the main character who have overcome a powerful enemy and become so strong fall into another pinch as though he suddenly became weaker.</p> <p><em>What the hell with you? You haven’t grown up at all</em>, it gave me that kind of feeling. I hate that kind of thing.</p> <p>This is a tale of Aria’s growth. Aria will grow as a warrior, and also grow as a girl. Please watch over her warmly.</p> <p>.</p> <p>Hitakiyuu-sensei has also drawn the illustrations prettily. From this volume he is changing the designs to be lovelier too because of the story entering part two.</p> <p>The battle development is also finally appearing in the comic. Coupled with Wakasa Kobato-sensei’s cute drawing, even the brutal story can inadvertently make you feel warm.</p> <p>Well them, let’s meet again at volume 6. My thanks to all of you readers who had taken time to read this book, and the bookstores that gave place for this book, and everyone who is involved with this book’s publication!</p>
