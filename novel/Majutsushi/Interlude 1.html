<h3>Interlude &#8211; Fairis&#12305; ~About Yard-sama and Elmaire-san~</h3>

<p>&#12288;When I talked with Elmaire-san, the dark elf woman that Yard-sama brought back, I found out that she was surprisingly talkative.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I saw her for the first time, she was hiding behind Yard-sama, so I thought she might not be good at socializing, but that seemed to be because she couldn't understand the language of Margarete-sama and the other soldiers.</p>
<p>&#12288;When she talked to me or Yard-sama, she didn't seem to be confused and talked normally, so the shock of memory loss didn't seem to be that great. She must have been a cheerful person before she lost her memory. After talking with her for a while, she even smiled at me. She is a strong person.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, I can't imagine how painful it must be to not be able to communicate with someone who has no memory of you. I can't even imagine what it must be like for her, but I will try to be as close to her as possible so that I can at least help her. It's the best thing I can do.</p>
<p>&#12288;On a different note, her clothes were dirty, so I helped her change, but for some reason she wasn't wearing any underwear, so I asked her if she had done anything physically, and she said she was fine. I had always thought that Yard-sama was surprisingly quick with his hands when it came to women, but I was relieved for now.</p>
<p>&#12288;Although he usually gives the impression of being calm and collected, I don't trust him when it comes to women. In the first place, I can only think that there is something underhanded in bringing a woman with amnesia to be his disciple. Even in the original world, there were times when unreasonable priests who lacked faith would mess with apprentices and students.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm sure that Yard-sama, who can use more magic than I can, is a very devout believer, but I don't think he's just looking at her purely as a disciple.</p>
<p>&#12288;And there are other reasons to be suspicious of Yard-sama. The way the women close to Yard-sama, such as the exclusive maid and Sophia-sama, looked at him was like a maiden in love. He must have been hitting on them before he left the palace.</p>
<p>&#12288;He hasn't done anything like that to Me and Margarete-sama yet, but we have to be careful. In particular, let's keep a careful eye on Elmaire-san, whom Yard-sama brought back himself, to make sure she doesn't fall under Yard-sama's poisonous influence.</p>
