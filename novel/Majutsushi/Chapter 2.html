<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211; False Emotions, Made Love</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.1</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;After the audience was over, we were each escorted by our personal maid to the location of our room. The room was large, but so empty that it made me miss my original laboratory.</p>
<p>&#12288;After checking the room, we gathered in Alec's room. There were currently six people in this room: the four heroes, Sophia who had joined us for some reason, and Alec's personal maid.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm not used to meeting people I've never met before, but I couldn't think of any reason to refuse this gathering, so I told myself that the first thing to do was to understand the current situation and strengthen friendly relations, and I had no choice but to participate.</p>
<p>&#12300;Let's first see what we can do for each other in working as heroes in this country. I'll speak first, and then we can speak in turn.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It seems that we will start by confirming each other's abilities. I think we've already introduced ourselves.</p>
<p>&#12300;My weapon is a magic sword. I can't use magic on my own, but with the blessing of the Great Spirit that resides in this sword, I can use magic through the sword. As long as I have this sword, no matter how many soldiers from the Demon Empire come, I will not be defeated.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Alec pulled out his sword with a confident look on his face. It is true that it contains more magic power than a normal magic tool. It seems to be absorbing and storing the magic power of its surroundings little by little. I'm sure that even people who can't use magic will be able to activate the magic formula written on the sword.</p>
<p>&#12288;I was a little curious, so I asked him to show me what kind of magic he could use, and he showed me the electric light around the sword. According to him, it can have five attributes, but we don't need this kind of ability for warfare against people. I'd like to see him use at least some tactical level magic, but I guess that's just medieval level magic.</p>
<p>&#12288;It's a shame for Alec, but he's not going to become a war potential. In any case, when he had finished showing us his magic sword, he turned to Fairis and urged her to be the next, and she nodded and stood up. From her speech earlier and the way she was dressed, I guessed that Fairis was probably a recovery type magician.</p>
<p>&#12300;Though I can't use offensive magic, but I can use healing magic instead. I think I can heal most wounds if they are still alive. On the battlefield, I plan to heal the injured person.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What do you mean by "Recovery Magic", for example, if a limb is amputated, can it be healed without any aftereffects?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, as long as they are still breathing.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I can't believe you can use recovery magic, which is the grace of God. ...... Fairis-sama was a saint, aren't you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Sophia is impressed by what Fairis has to say. According to what I've heard, there are only about a handful of people in this world who can use recovery magic on the level of Fairis, who are called saints.</p>
<p>&#12288;The shocking truth that came to me again left me speechless. I had no idea that the high-priority restorative magics had not been developed to this extent.</p>
<p>&#12288;There are many recovery magics that do not depend on personal qualities, and I can use several of them. Of course, you don't need to have faith or any other useless elements.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, the faith-based recovery formula that the two of them are talking about is a primitive formula that relies heavily on the magical qualities of the individual. This is an easy way to understand that talent is everything: those who can use it can use it from birth, and there are those who can't can't use it forever.</p>
<p>&#12288;If they had the time to perfect a magic like summoning a hero, I'd say they should research a recovery magic that can be used by ordinary people.</p>
<p>&#12288;I was impressed in a bad way by the level of magic technology in this world that was so unbalanced, and before I knew it, it seemed that Fairis was done talking, and Sagami stood up. I was impressed by his straight back, like a soldier.</p>
<p>&#12300;I can't make anything too big with my crafting magic, but I can make something as big as a weapon. I've also mastered the art of close combat, so I can fight on the front lines, but I think I'm better suited for intelligence and reconnaissance missions. I'd appreciate it if you'd think about it when you assign me to a unit.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Sagami's term "Craft Magic" is a general term for magics that specialize in command input commands and shape-shifting morphing. The main purpose of this is to create tools, constructs, golems, etc. It is a rather rare magic that can sometimes be seen in worlds that evolved without relying on magic during the development of early civilizations and later established a magic technology system.</p>
<p>&#12288;He seem to be more useful than the other two, as he have at least some knowledge of science and magic technology. By the way, he can also make machine guns for group warfare. No matter how many Alec attacks him, he'll be able to defeat Alec.</p>
<p>&#12300;Well then, it's Yard-sama turn next.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was thinking that I might be able to talk to Sagami about magic, my turn came.</p>
<p>&#12288;After listening to the stories that I've heard so far that I'm not even proud of, I came up with the mysterious idea that the only thing I can do here is to show off my magic skills, and I stood up with a sense of confidence.</p>
<p>&#12300;You can assume that I can use all the basic magic, but as I said earlier when I introduced myself, I'm good at the Fourth Type of Strategic Magic and the Seventh Type of Telephathy Magic. If I ever go into battle, I think I'd be better suited for rear support than fighting on the front lines.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The Fourth Type of Strategic Magic is a general term for magic that can be used to target a wide range of targets over a very long distance, and this is the type of magic that I have been studying day and night in the laboratory in my original world.</p>
<p>&#12288;And the Seventh Type of Telephatic Magic is a system of magic that does not require chanting or movement elements to activate the magic, but mainly affects the brain, nerves, and memory. Telephathy magic can be classified as Strategic Class Magic, but this is because they were created in military laboratories, and there are no particular rules.</p>
<p>&#12288;Incidentally, Tactical and Strategic Class magics are classified as military secrets.</p>
<p>&#12300;Wait, I don't know what you're saying. Are you referring to Strategic-Class magic, or large-scale range magic? And explain the other one in detail, please. When you say telepathy system, the only thing I can think of is telepathy.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Maybe he didn't understand what I was saying, but Sagami said something like that. The others seemed to have a question mark floating in their heads as well. That's the problem with people who don't even know how to classify different strains. I have no choice but to activate the telephatic as a demonstration.</p>
<p>(In other words, this kind of magic.)</p>
<p>&#12288;Telephatic is the basis of all telepathy magics, and it is an important technique that can be considered essential. It is said that anyone who can't do this can't master the telephathy system.</p>
<p>&#12288;The four of them stared at me, perhaps surprised that they could hear my voices even though I was not moving my mouth.</p>
<p>(Huh? Yard-sama, did you just speak to me?)</p>
<p>(This is similar to the oracle of the ...... Great Spirit, isn't it?)</p>
<p>(I also feel like I've received an oracle. You are speaking to me, aren't you?)</p>
<p>(A magic that allows you to speak without the use of invocation. And to be able to use it without any chanting or tools, you're an splending magician.)</p>
<p>&#12288;Sophia doesn't seem to understand what was done to her, but it's good that the heroes got the message.</p>
<p>&#12288;In fact, I'm better at Brainwashing and &lt;Mind Steal&gt; than Telephatic, but it's not a technique that is generally well received, so it's probably best not to mention it. And if people know that I can use those magic, there's a good chance I'll get into troublesome situation.</p>
<p>&#12300;Can this magic, for example, be used to launch from here to the front line?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, as long as I have some kind of landmark that can identify the person, I can use this magic anywhere in this world.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see. ....... It's a very important magic in this world where radio is not available.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Sagami asked me a good question and I answered him, he was surprised to realize the beauty of this magic.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, he was the only one who showed any real reaction to what I said. The rest of them were saying with a look on their face, "What's wrong with that?" Yes, to be honest, I had underestimated their lack of understanding.</p>
<p>&#12288;I was shocked that they praised me more for my non-chanting fire.</p>
<p>&#12288;In the end, I couldn't demonstrate the strategic level magic, but that was okay. I can't use flashy magics that even they can understand indoors, it's too hard to draw a magic circle, and I don't want to waste too much magic power before that.</p>
<p>&#12288;The most important information for me is that I'm going to have to live in a world where magic technology is so far behind. At first glance, it looks like nothing but despair, but depending on how you look at it, it's the perfect stage.</p>
<p>&#12288;Prepare yourselves, people of this world. This world, which lags behind in magic technology, is a huge toy box for me. Let me play with it as I please.</p>
<p>&#12300;Alright, from now on, the four of us will join forces to fight against the Demon Empire. Let's trust, cooperate, and help each other to achieve this. Of course, it is also important that we do not forget to train every day and try to adjust to this country as soon as possible. We are the heroes who should be the norm for the people, so let's not act arrogantly and ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I was instantly bored by Alec's story, which seemed to be going on for too long, and I was thinking about what I was going to do, pretending to be listening seriously.</p>
<p>&#12288;To be honest, unlike these guys, I refuse to participate in a war. We don't even know the enemy's strength yet, so who would want to participate in a battle where there is a possibility of death? If the need arises, I will consider fleeing from this castle.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;After the meeting, which was not very productive, I had dinner with Sophia and the others and went straight back to my room. Unfortunately, it seems that showers and baths are not widespread in this world, and even the nobles only wipe their bodies with hot water from time to time.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm a surprisingly clean person, so not taking a bath for a day is quite a pain. But if I don't have a bath, I have no choice. I decided to at least wipe myself off, so I asked her to bring me some hot water.</p>
<p>&#12300;Excuse me, I've brought you some hot water.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The person who brought the hot water was my personal maid, Tia. She looks to be in her early twenties, with glossy black hair that looks like a raven's wet feathers, stretched to shoulder length, and a very pretty face. Her breasts are very assertive, which suits my taste perfectly.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama, I'll wipe you down.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see, thank you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;"It's fine," Tia replied with a laugh. I've always wanted a girl like her in the lab. I take off my clothes and expose my upper body. Perhaps she was surprised by my unexpectedly muscular body, but she opened her eyes wide. Strategic-grade formulas take a lot of physical strength in addition to magical power, so it's a magician's duty to work out every day, even if he's holed up in the lab.</p>
<p>&#12300;You are well trained, aren't you? I was surprised because many wizards don't train much.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;In my world, it is normal for magicians to train their own bodies.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She stared at me sullenly, so I put a little effort into making my muscles rise. Tia's cheeks are stained as she wipes my body. This reaction seems to have a surprisingly strong pulse.</p>
<p>&#12288;It won't be long before the spring of my life arrives. Just as I thought that, a warning sound rang out in my brain.</p>
<p>(&#12302;The First magic barrier has been penetrated. The second magic barrier has been succeeded in defense. The attack magic has been successfully traced. It is assumed that the attack magic is a type 7 Material Interference Magic from close range.&#12303;)</p>
<p>&#12288;The magic barrier that is always deployed is a general-purpose barrier made up of five layers of barriers that can be used against both physical and magic. It prevents magic from being cast against me, and at the same time, it sends the warning message I mentioned earlier to my head.</p>
<p>&#12288;If it was a matter interference system, was she trying to find out physical information, or was she trying to paralyze me? If the magic barrier could have prevented this, then I don't have to worry about the details, but in this case, the problem is that Tia is currently the only one at close range. If there is no one else who can perform the magic, I can only assume that she has invoked the magic against me. The ring that is emitting a faint magic power is probably the magic tool.</p>
<p>&#12288;I've only known her for a short time. I don't believe we had a relationship where she suddenly attacked me, so I wonder if the current magic is pure interest or something else. That's not so bad if you think you're interested in me.</p>
<p>&#12288;In the meantime, I activate the &lt;Mind Steal&gt; to find out the truth.</p>
<p>(Strange, why can't I see any his physical information? Don't tell me if he's aware of my intentions and are wearing magical defensive equipment? But there's nothing that looks like it. ...... I can't report to the Duke at this point. ......)</p>
<p>&#12288;The magic formula was activated, and I could hear her pitch black mind.</p>
<p>&#12288;Damn, I knew it would play out like this anyway. She was the only one who had activated the magic formula, so she was the most suspicious in all likelihood. In addition, I had a vague feeling that she was doing something wrong when she activated the magic without telling me.</p>
<p>&#12288;At the very least, I hoped that she was being threatened by someone. Then I could have rescued her from the threat and increased his sensitivity.</p>
<p>&#12288;After lamenting in my mind for a while, I had to find out who the duke was first, so I activated my &lt;Memory Reading&gt;.</p>
<p>&#12288;What I found out after going through her memories was that the duke who appeared in her thoughts was called Duke Diane, and he was the man on the right side of the audience. I didn't expect to be suspected by someone so close to the heart of the country. Does it mean that he didn't trust us while asking for our help?</p>
<p>&#12288;It was a good thing that I was called in as a hero, but in the end I was just a political pawn.</p>
<p>&#12288;At best, they can use me as they see fit. I'll do what I want. Yes, it's just fine to play with people from a world that lags behind in magic technology.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm done wiping. If you need anything else, please feel free to call on me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, Please wait a moment.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, what can I do for you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She seemed to have finished wiping my body while I was thinking about various things, and I hurriedly stopped her as she was about to leave with the hot water. I'm not so good-natured that I'm going to keep quiet when she treats me like this, so I'm going to thank the original culprit, Dian, for this treatment. Tia-san is my type, so I'll keep this matter to myself.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'd like to see if the same magic will work in this world as it did in my original world. I need someone to help me, so I'm sorry, but can you help me?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, yes, that's fine. What kind of magic is it?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's a magic that allows you to send a contact-type magic to a specific person from a distance. If you I use this, I'll be able to send recovery-type magic to soldiers on the front line from outside the enemy's range.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's great! It's a wonderful magic! I understand. If it's all right with you, I'd like to help.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It seems that she is interested in my magic, so she puts the hot water on the floor and comes to me happily. I would have been soothed by her smile, but now that I know her inner thoughts, I realize that this smile is an act, and I feel empty and sad rather than happy.</p>
<p>&#12288;But my resentment was not against her, but against the duke, Dian, who had given her this task. I can never forgive that duke.</p>
<p>&#12288;Putting my inner thoughts aside, I handed her a coin from my original world as she approached me. She flipped it over and played it with her fingers, curiously looking at the coins that were engraved with various magics to prevent counterfeiting. She seemed to be using a ring-shaped magic tool to find out if there was a magic formula, but since it was just a coin, nothing happened.</p>
<p>&#12288;All I need now is for her to have something that belongs to me. There is no fear that she is reading my thoughts, as she is not using any mind-sensing magics. I haven't lied about what I'm about to do, so even if she has some means of detecting falsehoods, she won't be aware of my intentions.</p>
<p>&#12300;Please keep the coin. The magic I'm about to use can only be used on the person holding the coin, and I need your consent. If you have any magic-resisting tools, please remove them as well.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't have any of those things, so it's okay. Please begin at any moment.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She says that it's okay, but I already know that the anti-telephathy barrier is deployed. She seems to think that she is unnoticed because it is in an invisible state, but I can see that she is lying because I can penetrate her level of barrier and read her thoughts. It doesn't matter if there is a barrier or not.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm going to be careful not to give her the impression that I distrust her, and I'm going to activate the second type of telephathy magic, &lt;Domination&gt;. This magic can only be used on a person who has received the magician's property, and can only be used if the person has consented to the use of the magic, or if the person has broken the contract made with the magician.</p>
<p>&#12288;It is a useful magic that allows the user to freely manipulate the memories and emotions of the target, and also allows the user to send some contact-type magics even when the target is far away from the magician. In addition, unlike brainwashing, which only temporarily manipulates memories and emotions, this magic fixes memories and emotions in a normal state after the manipulation, and cannot be cured by counter-magic such as spell cancelation. It's a perfect magic for falsifying memories.</p>
<p>&#12288;As the effects of the magic appeared, she shook her body with fear caused by the high resistance of the magic when her memories were tampered with and her mind was altered, but she soon regained her composure and looked at me with a different feeling in her eyes. It seems to have succeeded without any problems.</p>
<p>&#12300;Who's your real master?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's you, Yard-sama.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What was the mission you were given?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;To pose as Duke Dian's subordinate and extract as much information as possible from him.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;All right, that's pretty good.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Now she's my loyal pawn. She's so cute as she stares at me with a real smile on her face, unlike the act she just did. I had raised her favorability toward me as much as possible while falsifying her memory, and it seems that I was right.</p>
<p>&#12288;Some people may not like manipulated favoritism, but human emotion itself is just an illusion created by drugs and electrical signals in the brain. For me, it's not much different from playing with the programming of an electronic device.</p>
<p>&#12288;Besides, it's better to be liked than to be hated by the woman of my type.</p>
<p>&#12288;By the way, she is the first person who has been applied this magic. In my original world, there was no one with such a low level of resistance to this magic, and I had thought about the possibility of failure. This is going to be easy to play with people from this world.</p>
<p>&#12300;Okay, tell me what you know about the Duke.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;The Duke is the leader of an anti-royalist group and is also connected to the Demon Empire. What I was ordered to do this time was to investigate the abilities of the heroes, including master, and if possible, to put on the bracelet of slavery.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;So it's the Demon Empire at once. At this rate, they may have already gotten information about heroes. So, was the duke told that if he cooperated with the Demon Empire, he would receive the proper status and money?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, I heard that he has signed a contract that if he hand over the heroes to the Demon Empire, he will be given the marquis rank in the Demon Empire. The only people in the palace who know about this deal are Duke Dian, Count Kreuzer, Count Gutran, Baron Nildo, and the heroes personal staff, including myself.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I see, he was going to abandon the inferior kingdom and defect to the Demon Empire? It is true that this country, which can only rely on outsiders who are heroes, is like a mud boat that could sink at any moment. If you think about it normally, it would be the Demon Empire that would win, so it is hard to say that the duke's decision was wrong.</p>
<p>&#12288;The only mistake that Duke Dian made was trying to use us, or rather me, as a hostage in the deal.</p>
<p>&#12288;It's not something I can forgive. How can I repay this grudge?</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.2</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;As I was thinking about this, I suddenly felt a gaze on me. I looked up and saw Tia-san, or should that be Tia already? Tia was swaying her body and looking at me with eyes that seemed to want something.</p>
<p>&#12288;Oh, I forgot about her. I should reward her for giving me the information about the Duke.</p>
<p>&#12300;Aah, I'm sorry. I'll reward you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I patted the bed to encourage her to sit beside me, and she happily sat there and leaned towards me. I can feel her softness even through her clothes, and it makes me feel good.</p>
<p>&#12288;I push her down on the bed and take her lips, and she stretches out her tongue and aggressively tries to intertwine it with mine. I lick her gums, feed her saliva, and enjoy her mouth to the fullest while listening to her ragged breathing. Her mouth seemed vaguely sweet. She seemed to be enjoying kissing me. When I pulled my mouth away from hers, she stretched her tongue out as if to say goodbye, so I dripped saliva on it and she swallowed it deliciously.</p>
<p>&#12300;How is it, are you satisfied?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ah, master ...... err ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She looks away from my question, as if it's difficult to answer. The way she held her crotch and glanced at me as if she was expecting something, even though she was shy, looked like she was trying to provoke me.</p>
<p>&#12288;But then I dared to pretend not to notice her and stood up to adjust my clothes. It was up to me to take the initiative. She looked at me with a sad look on her face.</p>
<p>&#12300;What's wrong? If there's something to say then say it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Please let me serve Master more. I want to please Master with my body.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Very well. Take off your clothes and wait.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;..! Yes!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She makes a happy voice and starts to undress. I took off my clothes too and climbed onto the bed. She seemed to be the skinny type, and her breasts were bigger than I had imagined. I stare at her and she shyly tries to hide them with her arms, but it only seems to emphasize the size of her breasts.</p>
<p>&#12300;Let's have you lick mine first.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I thrust my cock in front of her and she kissed the tip as if she couldn't wait. Seeing a woman like Tia stretching out her tongue to lick up my cock so deliciously made me feel a sense of superiority of being in control of a woman. She was not very good at giving blowjobs, perhaps its her first time, but she licked carefully from the base to the tip and sucked frantically in her mouth. Thanks to her enthusiastic service, my cock became hard and erect.</p>
<p>&#12300;Nnhh....Myasterr, hyow it is...?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I watched her looking up at me as she worked on my cock, I suddenly felt the urge to play a prank. I grabbed her head and moved my hips so that I could slam it into the back of her throat. She gagged from the impact on the back of her throat, but her reaction was a pleasant stimulus that made me feel better. I slam my hips into her again and again, despite her struggles, but she doesn't spit out my cock, but rather moves her tongue frantically, trying to give me pleasure.</p>
<p>&#12300;Nnhhh, I think I'm about to cum, I'm gonna let it out in your mouth&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Nodding at my words, she began to work harder. As I was about to come out, I thrust the cock as hard as I could to reach the back of her throat. Her throat tightened as a reflection of the cock hitting the back of her throat with force, and I felt the stimulation as I poured a large amount of my semen down her throat.</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/IQS9QHL.jpg"></img>

			<p>&#12288;She seemed to be trying desperately to swallow the semen, even though she was about to put it back in, but the semen that she couldn't swallow was flowing back and spilling out of her mouth. She wiped up the spilled semen and swallowed it, then smiled debaucherously at me.</p>
<p>&#12300;Haaa... let me clean it: ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She sucked up the remaining semen inside and licked my cock, which was sticky with saliva and semen, making obscene sounds. I was getting hard again as I watched her, so I stopped her from serving me and made her lie on her back.</p>
<p>&#12300;I couldn't stand it if you were serving me so enthusiastically. I'm going to come inside you now.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes! Please carve Master's shape inside me with your hot cock!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;There was no way I could refuse after being told that much, so I penetrated her already wet vagina hole at once. It was not her first time, and there was no resistance to break the membrane, but her insides were tightly entwined with the cock as if she were a virgin. She didn't seem to feel any pain either, and was actively moving her hips to get pleasure from it. As my fingers slowly sank into her breasts, I squeezed them and slammed my cock deep into her, as if it would reach her cervix to memorize my shape, just like she said.</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahhhh! Master, it feels so good!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah... it feels so good inside you, too! I just let it out earlier, but I'm going to immediately cum again!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She put her arms around me and hugged me, begging me to kiss her, so I hugged her tightly too. I hug her tightly and she aggressively twirls her tongue around mine, swallowing my saliva with relish. Her vagina clenched tightly as she squeezed my semen out of me, and I could taste her insides to the fullest.</p>
<p>&#12288;Her face was completely debauched, her cheeks flushed as if she was looking at her lover, her arms and legs entwined around me, our skin close together. Enjoying that soft touch, we were almost out of room.</p>
<p>&#12300;Tia, I'm coming inside you!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes! Please pour Master's seed inside me!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Aahh, I'm coming!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hahhhnnn! Master's semen is coming inside me!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I slam my hips into her with great force and ejaculate. She climaxes from the pleasure of the semen slamming into her, and her vagina tightens up, trying to squeeze out the semen.</p>
<p>&#12288;I can feel that I'm producing more semen than I've ever produced before because it feels so good, but it's the same for her, and she keeps climaxing as she bends over backwards from the sheer pleasure.</p>
<p>&#12300;Haa...... haa...... thank you very much, Master.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I waited for Tia to calm down, she turned her face down in embarrassment, but said so in a happy voice. She was so cute on the bed that I couldn't help but push her over and start the second round.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;After that, I ended up doing it three times. Physically, I was in a bit of pain, but mentally, I was in the best shape of my life. Black-haired beauties are the best, after all.</p>
<p>&#12288;According to what I heard afterwards, Dian is also on a mission to bring in enemy soldiers while creating a commotion from the inside when the armies of the Demon Empire attack. It seems that he is planning to make the enslaved heroes defect at that time and disrupt the kingdom.</p>
<p>&#12288;Well, the mission to hand over the heroes has already become unattainable, but it would be better to keep Dian from knowing about it until then. Since Tia is already on my side, I can let her make a false report.</p>
<p>&#12300;Tia, what are your plans for the future?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;First of all, in the morning, the Second Princess Margarete will talk to us about the situation on the front lines and our policies. As soon as that's done, she'll be leaving for the frontline base as soon as possible in the afternoon.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;The second princess, is there only princesses in this country?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, we have the First Prince, Robert-sama, and the Second Prince, Rand-sama. I believe they were next to the King at yesterday's audience. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh yeah, I remember there was someone there at that time.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;In the middle of the audience, I didn't have time to pay attention to such people, so it's no wonder I don't remember them. But still, you're going to the front line as soon as yesterday? I had heard that the front line was on the verge of collapse, but this must mean that the situation was pretty bad. I don't like the idea of suddenly joining a battle in which we are outnumbered, but now that I've accepted the job, I have no choice.</p>
<p>&#12300;I guess I should start by stabilizing my position.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What do you mean by that?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It means exactly what it says. There's no need for me to care about the people of this world. I'll use my magic to increase my allies.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;My immediate goal is to gain enough allies and positions to move freely in this world, even if I have to use magic like I did to Tia. First of all, I'd like to have someone of high rank.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;">&#8251;</p>
<p>&#12288;The members for breakfast were almost the same as yesterday. The only difference was that there was an additional woman who was not here yesterday. Perhaps that was the second princess.</p>
<p>&#12288;Her blond hair and blue eyes are the same as Sophia's, but unlike her sister, she has an amazing hairdo. I guess it's called a vertical roll, and her hairstyle looks aristocratic. Unlike Sophia, who had a gentle atmosphere, she had slanted eyes that gave me the impression that she was strong-minded.</p>
<p>&#12288;When she was introduced by the king, she bowed lightly to us, but did not speak at all during the meal.</p>
<p>&#12288;When the meal was over, I followed the second princess and moved on. For some reason, she glared at me while we were moving, and I wondered why I should be glared at by someone I had never met before.</p>
<p>&#12288;We entered a room that looked like a conference room and sat down in order. The only participants this time were the heroes and this princess.</p>
<p>&#12300;My name is Margarete Le Henrient, the second princess, and I would like to greet you again. I've already heard about the abilities of the heroes. I am glad that you have lent your strength to our country.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Margarete introduced herself with a dignified and well-cleared voice. Sophia looks like a princess, but Margarete looks better if you call her a princess. The vertical roll goes well with the haughty look of her face.</p>
<p>&#12288;She is undoubtedly a beautiful woman, but I prefer Sophia's purely for her looks.</p>
<p>&#12288;Based on my first impression, I don't really think I'd want her on my side. The fact that she is a commander is a plus, but her personality seems to be so bad that it cancels it out.</p>
<p>&#12300;Now, let me quickly tell you about the current situation. Currently, our army and the Demon Empire's army are in a stalemate near the Gurtha Fortress in the border region between the two countries. The fortress is not going to be taken down immediately, but the enemy is deploying a mass operation with far more men than our army, and the fortress is short on both men and supplies. If this fortress were to fall into the hands of the enemy, our defense line would be greatly reduced.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Does that mean we should defend the fortress?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, of course, we would like you to do that as well, but what is more important is to escort the supplies to be sent to the fortress. Currently, the forces of the Demon Empire are blocking the transportation of goods around the fortress. They must be planning to keep us holed up like this and hit us when our army becomes unbearable. On the other hand, if we can send enough supplies to the fortress here to last until winter, the forces of the Demon Empire that are not prepared to last the winter will have no choice but to retreat.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see, so it's an endurance battle.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;If you're talking about a siege, I think I can be of more use to you than fighting in the open field.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, I believe that with the help of the heroes, our army will surely be victorious.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Margarete and the other heroes were conversing in a friendly atmosphere, but I had my doubts about the plan she had mentioned. In short, it seems to be a strategy to replenish supplies and hunker down until the opponent retreats, but if the opponent has a magician who can use large-scale magic, hunkering down with no place to escape is counterproductive.</p>
<p>&#12288;As long as I've been summoned to this world, there's no way to say that my opponent doesn't have an equal number of magicians. This is the difference between my awareness of magic and theirs.</p>
<p>&#12288;In the first place, it is said that there are about seven hundred soldiers in the fortress now, but the enemy is attacking the fortress with more than ten times that number. There is too much of a difference in strength. It's a miracle that they have been able to maintain the front until now. Now I can understand why Dian was trying to turn to the Demon Empire.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama. You seem to be thinking about something since a while ago, but did you hear what I said?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As if I hadn't been listening to the meeting, Margarete came over to talk to me. The princess was still glaring at me, but on closer inspection, I could see that her eyes were more like those of an insult than a dislike of me.</p>
<p>&#12288;I don't remember doing anything to be insulted. The only possibility is that I was having an affair with Tia, but I don't think she was even bothering to listen in. Is she simply underestimating me because I'm a magicians?</p>
<p>&#12288;Even if that's the case, I don't think it's a good idea to be so combative all of a sudden. It's not cool to try to be tough, it makes you look like you don't have any room. I think I'll keep a friendly attitude.</p>
<p>&#12300;I understand what you're talking about. There is nothing in particular I want to ask you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... What's wrong? Please continue talking regardless of me&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I felt uncomfortable with the way she stared at me without responding to my reply, so I tried to reply with a slightly sarcastic tone in my voice. Sure enough, the princess frowned and sent me a disdainful look that she didn't bother to hide.</p>
<p>&#12300; ...... I see. I'm sorry, but I didn't expect much from you. I heard about yesterday from my sister, and while the other heroes performed wonderful magic, I must admit that your magic was disappointing. If you were bored by my talk, you may leave.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I don't know what to say, but she's really thinking like a brainiac. It is true that the &lt;Telepathy&gt; that I demonstrated yesterday may look unassuming, but it is a useful magic that can convey fresh information, the most important thing in warfare, much faster than a messenger.</p>
<p>&#12288;It's a shame, and I can't help but feel pity for her, but of all the people around her, Sagami was the only one who showed a negative attitude towards the princess's words. Alec is nodding his head in agreement with the princess's words, and seeing that Fairis is not denying it, it seems that she agrees with the princess. This is why I hate uneducated people, they don't understand the importance of information warfare.</p>
<p>&#12288;No matter how ignorant she is, I feel irritated by this princess who is underestimating people before she even knows my capabilities. I have a policy of buying fights that are sold to me, so I'm going to give her a little pain.</p>
<p>&#12300;It seems that I am not needed in this meeting. I'm sorry, but I have to leave here.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;With that, I leave the room. Seeing me leave the room, the princess has a triumphant expression on her face. I'll look forward to the time when her relaxed expression falls apart.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2.3</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;I leave the conference room and return to my room, asking Tia for information about the second princess. She is the second child born to the queen, and the fourth in line of succession to the throne, which means she is the lowest.</p> <p>&#12288;Thanks to the fact that she is not participating in the succession struggle, she seems to be behaving quite freely, leading the knights to the front and taking command. It seems that she is now in charge of the defense of the Gurtha fortress.</p> <p>&#12288;She seems to be a skilled commander and has a high reputation among the soldiers of the castle, and now the soldiers trust her more than the princes. However, that is not important for now. What I need is something that can be a weakness of her.</p> <p>&#12300;Margarete-sama, is it? First of all, I've never heard of any blunders or ugly stories of her. As for the succession to the throne, there is little hope to begin with, so there are no conflicts, and I have heard that she get along well with her parents and her siblings. In addition, she is well-liked by both men and women because of her excellent literary and military skills and her decisiveness.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;She is a very capable personel in this country, huh. ...... Are there any rumors that she is actually homosexual or something like that?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I've never heard of anything like that either. It is true that she treats the queen and Sophia-sama more intimately than her male family members, but she is a bit fastidious, so she is not very fond of homosexuality or any other sexual affairs between men and women outside of their marriage.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;If that's the case, it's better to catch her from around than to take advantage of her weakness. Tia, do you have a better idea?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Well, Margarete-sama has been raised in a privileged environment since she was a child, so she shouldn't have any experience of being betrayed by people who are thought to be her allies. It would be good to spread ugly news to many people and lose people's trust, but I think it would be better to have her betrayed by her family and subordinates. I think we should use the first princess, Sophia-sama, who she says she trusts especially here.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Tia, with her cute face, is making a very black statement. Let's not make her too angry.</p> <p>&#12288;But still, it's quite a cruel proposal. For me, it's just a light threat of payback. She must be very frustrated that I was underestimated, and her anger towards the princess is evident in her voice when she talks about Margarete.</p> <p>&#12288;When I hugged her and patted her head, she seemed relieved and rubbed her face against my chest. All right, all right, I'll do my best for the sake of my lovely maid.</p> 			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p> 			<p>&#12288;I decided to go along with Tia's idea, and so I first tried to contact Sophia, who was the Margarete was closest to. She was probably the one who told Margarete about yesterday's conversation, so I decided to ask her how it went.</p> <p>&#12288;Since I had reminded her earlier that I had something confidential to discuss with her, Sophia was already waiting for me when I arrived at the room.</p> <p>&#12300;I'm sorry, but I need to talk to you.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;No, it's fine. If it's a request from a hero, it's easy enough to spare the time to talk to them.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;The maid came in, prepared tea for the two of us, and left. I've been trying to find out, but there doesn't seem to be anyone suspicious around the room. As a precaution, I put up a soundproof barrier to eliminate the possibility of eavesdroppers.</p> <p>&#12300;It seems that you have already told the second princess about yesterday's discussion.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, I made sure to tell her about the magic of the heroes. Marie seemed to be particularly concerned about Sagami-sama's magic. But I couldn't explain Yard-sama's magic very well, so I don't know if I told her properly. I'm sorry for my lack of knowledge.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;It seems that Marie is Margarete's nickname, and if that's the case, Sophia would be called Sophie or something.</p> <p>&#12288;As she continued to talk in a good mood, I used the &lt;Mind Steal&gt; to avoid being noticed, and found out that she was indeed telling her about yesterday. However, it seemed that my information had not been conveyed correctly. Sophia's explanation would have conveyed only enough to have a conversation without moving her mouth.</p> <p>&#12288;I don't think even Sagami, who is probably the second most knowledgeable person on the subject after me, fully understands it, so in a way, it can't be helped, but they all misunderstood my strategic class magic.</p> <p>&#12288;The strategic class is not only for offensive magics, but also includes magics such as ultra-distant transference and group consciousness induction.</p> <p>&#12288;In the first place, offensive strategic class magics are so large that they are used in interstellar wars. They are usually so broad that they can annihilate a country or two if they are not good enough to distinguish between friend and foe, so it is impossible to use them in places where war has already broken out or in your own country.</p> <p>&#12288;However, the power of their imagination is drastically wrong, and they think that it can blow up a dozen people. It's not a strategic level, it's just a range magic, not even a tactical level.</p> <p>&#12288;There are probably a good number of magicians who can use ranged magic, so I can understand why Margarete would want to insult me after hearing her unreliable information about me. Well, I'm not going to stop trying to get back at her for actually insulting me, though.</p> <p>&#12300;I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation, but I have something to ask you.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;By the way, you said you wanted to talk to me about something. If it's okay with me, please tell me anything.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;At this point, I use the Seventh Type of Telepathy Magic, the &lt;<ruby>Thought-Guiding<rt>Guidepost</rt></ruby>&gt;. This is a magic that dulls the other person's reasoning and prevents them from questioning my words. It's not like you can manipulate your opponent's thoughts, but unlike brainwashing, this is a counter magic that doesn't break the spell, and unlike &lt;Dominate&gt;, there are no conditions, so depending on how you use it, it can be quite useful.</p> <p>&#12300;As a matter of fact, I had an argument with Margarete-sama at the meeting earlier, and it seems that she thinks I'm slowing her down.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;That's ...... very rude of her, and I apologize on behalf of my sister. I'm sure you're offended, but I'm sure my sister is just misunderstood. It was I who was at fault for explaining Yard-sama magic, so please forgive Marie with a generous heart.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yeah, it's okay. I'm not saying that she's at fault, because my attitude was also at fault. It's just that I'm embarrassed to have run out of the conference room, and I need your help to reconcile with her.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I see. Then by all means, let me help you.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Looking at her smiling face, I can see that she and her sister really seem to be on good terms. I guess this will go as planned.</p> <p>&#12300;Thank you. I've heard that you and Margarete are very close sisters, so if I show her that you and I are on good terms, I'm sure she'll be friendly with me, what do you think?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;That's a wonderful idea. I think that's a good idea too.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I'm already talking out of turn, but she doesn't seem to notice and agrees with my opinion. From what I've heard about Margarete's personality, I think it's normal to think that she would go crazy if she saw me and Sophia getting along well, but I guess she doesn't have such doubts because of the magic I used.</p> <p>&#12288;Well, the preparations for the mission had just begun. I got out of my seat and walked over to her and took her hand in mine, which was still confused.</p> <p>&#12300;In fact, everything I've said so far has been in order to say something to you.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I looked her in the eyes and said the words after a pause.</p> <p>&#12300;Sophia-sama, I love you as a man.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;With the words, I activated the magic without chanting. The Seventh Type of Telepathy Magic, &lt;Paradise Happiness&gt;. The effect is to secrete a narcotic into the brain, making the target feel happy. It is one of the easiest of the telephathy formulas.</p> <p>&#12288;In addition, I'll use &lt;Madness&gt;. If you use it in its original effect, it will strip away the reasoning of your opponent and put them in a state of excitement, but I've reduced the effect to just a little bit of excitement.</p> <p>&#12288;After receiving these two magics on top of the effects of the &lt;<ruby>Thought-Guiding<rt>Guidepost</rt></ruby>&gt; I used earlier, she honestly believed my confession, which was sudden and suspicious no matter how you look at it. She froze in surprise for a moment, but when she regained consciousness, her cheeks flushed and she turned her face away.</p> <p>&#12300;P-Please don't joke with me. We've only just met. ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;As the saying goes, love at first sight, time has nothing to do with love. Or do you hate me?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I don't hate you at all! Ah, well, no. ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;The fact that she was shyly glancing at me suggests that she was happy with my words. The euphoria and excitement she felt at the same time as my confession must be making her feel as if she were in love.</p> <p>&#12288;Her rational mind is suppressed and not working properly, so it doesn't seem to occur to her that she, as royalty, can't have a relationship with an unknown person like me who was called in out of the blue.</p> <p>&#12288;She was unsure of how to react to me, so I lightly pulled her to me and brought her face close to mine, almost nose to nose. Her eyes are moist and red, which I think is cute, though not as cute as Tia's.</p> <p>&#12300;Sophia-sama, will you accept my love?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I can't believe I'm saying this, but the way I look right now is pretty weird. Anyway, here's another shot of &lt;Paradise Happiness&gt; for a bad push. The euphoric feeling that comes over her again causes her body to relax and she becomes flustered. I guess it's okay now.</p> <p>&#12300;Yard-sama. I love you too.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Sophia replies with a beautiful smile. We looked at each other and our lips naturally touched each other. It was our first time, so we kept it light and parted our lips.</p> <p>&#12300;Sophia ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Please call me Sophie......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Sophie, I love you.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I love you too, Yard-sama.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I hugged her around the waist and pulled her close, and she put her hand on my cheek too.</p> <p>&#12288;I kissed her a second time. I extend my tongue and push her pretty lips away from mine and enter her mouth. I lick her up gently as she stretches out her tongue to me. After a few tries, she tries to intertwine our tongues, and we feel the heat of each other's mouths.</p> <p>&#12288;I guess she couldn't breathe well after her first kiss, so when I pulled my mouth away, she looked down and put her hands on her chest, breathing a little.</p> <p>&#12288;Seeing her like that made me want to kiss her again, so I put my hand on her cheek and turned her around so I could put my mouth on hers. She wasn't breathing well yet, so I enjoyed her mouth as much as I could, feeling her rough breath against mine.</p> <p>&#12288;She reached her tongue into my mouth as well. The place where our tongues touched in my mouth felt good somehow.</p> <p>&#12288;We continued to mix our saliva and kiss each other so thickly that I thought I would lose the sensation in my tongue, until someone from the castle knocked on the door to tell us it was time for lunch.</p> <p>&#12288;Okay, now I'm ready to get back at Margarete.</p> 			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p> 			<p>&#12288;After lunch, while the soldiers were hurried around getting ready to leave, I decided to call Margarete with Sophie's help. As I waited alone in Sophie's room for her to arrive, I heard footsteps for both of them, so I made myself presentable as well.</p> <p>&#12300;Thank you for your patience, Yard-sama. I've called Marie, as you requested.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I'm sorry. Thank you for taking the time out of your busy schedule.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;In contrast to Sophie, who was talking to me with a smile, Margarete had a sullen expression on her face, as if she was unwilling to talk to me. When our eyes met, she gave me a hostile look, but I brushed it off with a serious face.</p> <p>&#12288;We both took our seats. Margarete and I are facing each other. Sophie let her sister sit first and then sat down next to me. Margarete frowns even more when she sees this.</p> <p>&#12300;Onee-sama. Why is this man here? He said he had something to tell me before we left, so I came.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, Marie. It's about the disagreement between you and Yard-sama. There was only a short time before your departure that I had the chance to reconcile the two of you.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Margarete glared at me at Sophie's words. It seems that she thinks that I've told her something. In fact, she is right.</p> <p>&#12300;I'm sorry. I asked her to prepare a place for me. Margarete-dono, I regret that my uncooperative attitude was the cause of your displeasure earlier. I would like to apologize for my rude attitude.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Before Margarete could say anything else, I took the initiative and apologized. Perhaps unexpectedly, she blinked her eyes a few times and let out a sigh. She looks at me again, but she doesn't send me the glaring look that she had just given me.</p> <p>&#12300;No, I was out of line too. I'm sorry that I said something that insulted the heroes.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;She seemed to be a good person at heart and accepted my apology without hesitation. She stood up and extended her hand to me, so I stood up and shook her hand as well.</p> <p>&#12288;Sophie, who had been watching us, smiled reassuringly and leaned toward me. Margarete looked astonished at her sister's sudden action.</p> <p>&#12300;What on earth are you doing, Onee-sama!? Please don't do such a trifling thing as leaning on a gentleman outside of your family!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;It's okay, Marie, I'm in love with Yard-sama. It's a natural feeling for a woman to want to be close to the man of her dreams.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;L-love you say!? Do you even know what you're saying!? Anyway, please get away from that man!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Margarete, unable to keep up with her sister's change, hurriedly tried to separate me and Sophie, but Sophie also grabbed my arm and resisted, trying not to be shaken off. This allowed me to enjoy the softness of her ample breasts as they pressed against my arm.</p> <p>&#12288;After successfully pulling Sophie away from my arms, Margarete pulled her arms and sat her down next to her.</p> <p>&#12300;Yard-sama, what is the meaning of this? My sister is not the kind of person who would do something like this. Did you do something bad to my sister, ......?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;No, I did not.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;What has Yard-sama done to you? I will not allow you to doubt him, no matter how much Marie think of me!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Before I could say anything, Sophie took a bite out of her sister with great speed. Well, she loves me, doesn't she?</p>

 			<p>&#12288;Letting go of Margarete, who was cowering from her sister's shouting, Sophie hugged me and put her lips on mine. She squeezed me tightly, and I wrapped my arms around her waist and hugged her.</p> <p>&#12288;We kissed as if to confirm our love for each other, and then she gently pulled away and looked at me with a shy smile on her face. There was already no trace of the look on her face when she yelled at her sister.</p> <p>&#12300;Marie, I love Yard-sama of my own free will. No matter what anyone says, this feeling will never change.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Sophie declares proudly to her sister. When Margarete heard her sister's confession, she wavered, looked around and gave us a clinging look.</p> <p>&#12300;It is not my intention to make you see this, but I love you too, Sophie. Of course, it was no joke, as you could see from what I just did.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Margarete, struck by my words, collapsed in her chair as if she had lost her thread. She seemed to be in a state of shock. Seeing her like this, my heart overflows with a sense of exhilaration. At the very least, she should regret her decision to fight me.</p> <p>&#12288;After that, Margarete said she suddenly remembered her business and left as if she was running away. The rest of us, Sophie and I, had already forgotten about her and were enjoying the last kiss before I left.</p>
