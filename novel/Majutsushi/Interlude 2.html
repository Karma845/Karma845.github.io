<h3>Interlude &#8211; Sagami&#12305; ~A review of the character of Yard Werner~</h3>

<p>&#12288;It is difficult to evaluate the person named Yard Werner in a few words.</p>
<p>&#12288;At first, I had the impression that he was a calm and proud person. When I saw that he was the only one who listened to the king's words calmly when he found out that he couldn't return to the original world, I felt ashamed of myself for being so uncool and distraught.</p>
<p>&#12288;After that, however, he started arguing with Margarete-dono like a child, or went out to buy liquor in town.</p>
<p>&#12288;The only thing that is certain is that he is a surprisingly humane person.</p>
<p>&#12288;When he welcomed Elmaire, a dark elf from an enemy country, as his apprentice, I had suspected that he was going to use her for something, but after that, he was really just educating her as his apprentice.</p>
<p>&#12288;And this time, he had accepted the job of exterminating bandits even though he knew that he would only receive a small reward in a town he just happened to visit. When Alec expressed his reluctance, he said he would fulfill the request even if it was just him and his apprentice.</p>
<p>&#12288;True to his word, he came back after destroying the bandits in just one day. Not everyone was safe, but those who were captured were able to return to their families.</p>
<p>&#12288;In the end, the bandit woman who had captured them alive was killed in a private execution, but I guess he couldn't stop them either, and I could see the sparkle in his eyes as he looked at her cruelly defiled body, as if he regretted the loss of her life.</p>
<p>&#12288;By the way, among the people he brought back, there was only one elf in the mix. Her name seemed to be Natalia, and I remembered that the elf who had given me the information about Leshiana had a wife with that name.</p>
<p>&#12288;I heard that she had been captured by bandits and was now missing, but perhaps she was the one.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I think of the euphoric expression on her face as she was caught in the arms of Yard-dono, I think that a <span style="font-style: italic;">mayhem</span>&nbsp;may be about to occur.</p>
<p>&#12288;At the very least, I'll give Yard-dono a heads up when the time comes before such a situation arises.</p>
