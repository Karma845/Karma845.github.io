<h3>Chapter 11 &#8211; Prey to Gloom and Doom, A Midnight Violation Play</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>11.1</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;Now that we had successfully formed an alliance, we could finally return to the royal capital. I immediately went to the hut where Lucia and the others were waiting and found two Dark Elves there. Both of them were dressed in magician-style robes, which indicated that they were not elves living here.</p>
<p>&#12288;They were looking at us curiously, but when they saw Elle, their eyes widened in surprise and they came closer to her.</p>
<p>&#12300;Elmair, you're alive. I thought you'd been killed in the failed raid.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm so glad! You were able to escape to Leshiana after that.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;A couple of men and women talk to Elle in a friendly manner. Apparently, they were Elle's friends. Elle, who had no memory of the Demon Empire, listened with a troubled face as the two spoke to her. Judging from the fact that she didn't understand what they meant, it seems that they were speaking to her in the language of the Demon Empire.</p>
<p>&#12300;What is it with you people? Coming up to us out of nowhere and not even saying hello? And you're dressed like that, are you from the Demon Empire?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hmm? That language doesn't belong to the Demon Empire. But it's not Elvish either.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You're a hero of the Kingdom, aren't you? I believe you have the ability to translate.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Because Alec spoke to them, our identity was instantly revealed. I wondered if their relaxed attitude, even though they knew we were heroes, was a sign of their confidence that they could easily defeat us.</p>
<p>&#12288;Alec and Sagami had already taken a step back and were drawing their weapons. It seems that they are willing to do so. But the other side, knowing that we are the heroes, is still showing a relaxed attitude. There may be some secret plan. It would be a mistake to start a battle without a fight.</p>
<p>&#12300;The people of the kingdom are savage. As soon as they see an enemy, they try to cut them down.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's a normal reaction. You are just cowards for not taking a stand when you see an enemy, aren't you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The two sides are giving off a tense vibe, but I'm going to stand back and watch. I'm sure the elves will jump on me if I fight here. I don't feel any sign of them now, but I'm sure they're watching us from a place we can't see.</p>
<p>&#12300;Oi, you there! Why are you trying to run away when your friends are trying to fight!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Think about it. I didn't come here to fight you guys. What's the use of wasting time fighting?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Even if you don't want to fight, there's no greater gain for us if we can defeat the heroes. After defeating these two, you will be next.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Oh, right, I haven't done anything heroic lately, so I didn't really understand the importance of us. I think Alec, who showed a lot of success in the battle at the fortress, is the one they want to defeat here.</p>
<p>&#12288;Then the man suddenly cut at me. Unfortunately, the attack didn't reach me because of the barriers put up for the battle, but I was a little surprised. It woke me up from my sleep, but the lack of sleep was quickly making me irritated.</p>
<p>&#12300;Elle, do it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;As you wish, Master.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;At my signal, Elle activated the &lt;Ice Statue&gt;. Since Elle was behind them, she was in the best position to attack. They didn't expect to be attacked by someone they thought was one of their own, and they were trapped in the ice, completely unable to avoid it.</p>
<p>&#12288;Alec was stunned to see the two of them incapacitated in an instant. Sagami was a little surprised, but quickly took stock of the situation and readied his armament. I guess he knows that it's not over yet.</p>
<p>&#12300;I've neutralized them.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, there are magics they can use even if they can't move. Didn't you learn that from your last mistake?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As expected, the ice is thinning little by little. It must have activated some kind of magic that melted the ice inside. Cracks appeared on the surface of the ice, and two people came out through the ice from inside.</p>
<p>&#12300;Elmaire! Why are you listening to that guy!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Wait, Elle didn't seem to understand what we were talking about earlier. Maybe the kingdom's people brainwashed her or something.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;When I brought her back, she already had no memory of what happened before, so I just made her my apprentice.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I also erased her memory, but I don't need to tell them that much. The two of them, who immediately grasped Elle's condition with my words, are trying to activate their magics towards me as if they are trying to defeat me first. These guys don't seem to be able to chantless either. It would have been a shame to have handed Adriana over in that town.</p>
<p>&#12302;O God, let the purifying fire consume the enemy before me!&#12303;</p>
<p>&#12302;O God, give me in my hands the blade of condemnation with which iniquity destroys men!&#12303;</p>
<p>&#12288;The two of them activated their magic. A man sent a mass of flames towards me, and a woman with a sword of light out to cut me. However, before their attacks could reach me, several arrows pierced their bodies.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I looked in the direction of the arrows, I saw several elves with bows at the ready. It seems they were watching us after all. They took one look at the two fallen men and disappeared back into the forest.</p>
<p>&#12300;I had no idea that the elves were still watching us nearby. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It seems that using fire in this forest is still dangerous.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Alec and Sagami were also taken aback by the sudden event. The elves had left, but what were they going to do with the rest? Are they just going to leave them here?</p>
<p>&#12288;I looked at the two collapsed people and saw that their chest was moving. It seems that both of them are still alive. They had been shot all over their bodies, but the fact that they weren't dead was probably because they had been pierced in the right place.</p>
<p>&#12288;If they were aiming for the right spot, then the elves of Leshiana are full of skilled archers.</p>
<p>&#12288;It was a hell of an ending, but I'm going to find out why these guys came to the forest in the first place.</p>
<p>&#12288;I stunned them as they moaned in pain, unable to stand up, and moved them to the warehouse next to the hut.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;When I arrived at the hut, I tied up the two dark elves and used the &lt;<ruby>Magic Sealing<rt>Sigil</rt></ruby>&gt; to make it impossible for them to use the magic. In addition, I also applied a &lt;Magic Stampede&gt;, so even if the seal is broken, I don't have to worry.</p>
<p>&#12300;Is the magic sealing procedure finished? I'd like to get some information out of them.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I can do that. I'm confident in my abilities in such matters.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Okay, I'll leave it to you then.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Both of you wanted to get information from them, but I wanted to try something with them, so both of them left them to me. And I'm not lying, because I'll get the information out of them as well.</p>
<p>&#12288;After confirming that Alec and Sagami had left, I put up a soundproof barrier to prevent people from hearing me and woke them up with the &lt;Awake&gt;.</p>
<p>&#12288;The multiple deployments were tiring in their own way, but I had no choice.</p>
<p>&#12288;They quickly regained consciousness due to the effects of the magic, but when they realized that they were tied up, they immediately began to flail about trying to break free.</p>
<p>&#12300;You bastard, untie me!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Do you know what's going to happen to you if you do this to us?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You're being held captive, but you're acting tough. Why don't I let you know the difference between our positions first?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I won't give up any information even if it gets me killed.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Hearing the man's words, I kicked the woman in the stomach without hesitation. There was a dull sound as if I had kicked a leather bag full of water, and the woman was slammed against the wall.</p>
<p>&#12288;The woman was spitting blood from her mouth and jumping up and down as she was hit in the stomach, which was completely unanticipated and defenseless.</p>
<p>&#12300;You bastard, why did you kick Lily! I'm the one you should be aiming for!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What's the point of kicking you? Look, if you don't answer my questions, she's going to get kicked instead. If you want to help her, you better answer fast.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ja-Jasper, ...... I'll be fine. ...... Don't listen to anything he says. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;So the woman is Lily and the man is Jasper. Well, I'll forget about it tomorrow. She's a bit groggy from the kick, but she's doing the best she can. But that's not good enough. It's not enough to make a man ready to die.</p>
<p>&#12300;Jasper, you say, if you tell me everything honestly, I'll let her go. Of course, if you don't tell me, I'll just keep going.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... I refuse. She'd rather die than give in to such threats&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I roll the woman onto her back and stomp down on her chest as hard as I can. There was a dull thud, and I felt the bones break. The broken sternum must have lodged in her lung. Blood was pouring out of her mouth, and she couldn't even speak as she thrashed about, spitting out blood.</p>
<p>&#12288;The man looked at my actions with a dumbfounded expression. I guess he didn't expect me to kill her out of the blue.</p>
<p>&#12288;A little while later, she stopped moving and died with an agonized expression on her face, her eyes wide open in extreme pain. The man who saw this also came to his senses and stared at her, struggling desperately with his bound body that could not move as he wished.</p>
<p>&#12300;What the hell have you done!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You're the one who said it was okay to die.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;But that doesn't mean you can't kill her out of the blue!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I cast &lt;Resurrection&gt; on the woman so that the man can see her. Her broken body was restored to normal and she quickly regained consciousness, spitting out the remaining blood in her mouth and looking at me with incredulous eyes.</p>
<p>&#12288;The man, too, was surprised to see her suddenly waking up after he thought she was dead and seemed unable to speak.</p>
<p>&#12300;...... What the hell did you do to me?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You died, so I brought you back to life. Just that.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;!!!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's impossible for such magic to exist!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Both of them respond to my answer as I expected. They both thought that if they died they wouldn't have to give up the information, but now that they're dead and escape is impossible, they have expressions of despair on their faces.</p>
<p>&#12288;They were prepared to be killed, but there was no way they were prepared to go through anything more painful than death.</p>
<p>&#12288;In fact, the information has already been obtained through &lt;Memory Reading&gt; when they were brought here, so there is no need to make these guys tell me anything. What I'm doing now is a way of thanking them for what they did earlier and also to relieve stress.</p>
<p>&#12300;If that's what you think, then do what you want. You don't have the freedom of choice anyway.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;If I tell you ......, will you just let her go?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Jasper!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;!! I'm sorry, Lily. I was confused.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Apparently, the guys have a surprisingly weak mentality. And looking at his attitude towards women, I don't think these guys are just colleagues. Looking at the man's memories again, it turned out that she was actually his lover.</p>
<p>&#12288;While I was thinking about what to do with this information, they were having some kind of conversation with their eyes. Their attitude of trust in each other seemed to spark something in me.</p>
<p>&#12288;Then suddenly, the devil whispered in my mind. Wouldn't it be interesting to break the ice between these two?</p>
<p>&#12300;Oi, you said, you're Lily. Turn around.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What? Mmugh!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The moment she turns to face me, I put the aphrodisiac I confiscated from Natalia in her mouth.</p>
<p>&#12288;She swallows it reflexively and tries to spit it out, but in my experience, once it's in her mouth, it's too late. I think she took several times the amount I did.</p>
<p>&#12300;W-What did you give me to drink?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's not poison, don't worry. More importantly, I've changed my mind, and I'll have you obey me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;How foolish ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, I knew you would say that. Let's make a bet.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What's the bet!? Hmm!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What you've just taken is an aphrodisiac. I'm leaving now, but in the meantime, you can do as you please with that man. When I return, I'll ask you again what you think. You can do whatever you want in there, of course, but if you try to unbind him or get out of here, you lose.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;W-what a bad taste. Nnhh ...... Okay, I guess I have no choice to ride along......?</p>
<p>&#12300;Thank you for quick on uptake. Good luck with that.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It seems that the effects of the aphrodisiac have already begun to show. It was far more than the right amount, but I don't know what's going to happen. If it was a human, they would have gone insane for sure, but let's hope for the strength of the elf's mind.</p>
<p>&#12288;Before leaving the room, I put a &lt;Calming&gt; on the man. The effect is simple: he will be able to remain calm and not become agitated or panic under any circumstances.</p>
<p>&#12288;Isolate the room with a reinforced ward for the magician's confinement, and lock the door with a &lt;Lock&gt;. Now they can't get out. All I had to do was to come back after a while.</p>
<p>&#12288;According to the information I got from the man, those two have come to form an alliance with Leshiana. If the negotiations failed, they had a plan to attack Leshiana by force. If they do not return, adventurers hired by the Demon Empire are scheduled to attack tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>&#12288;The adventurers numbered about two hundred, but some of them were known as dragon slayers. This can be used for Elle's training. I think I will sneak out this evening and go raid the encampment.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>11.2</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;Before I tell Alec and the others, I`ll try to confirm with Elaine by telepathic.</p>
<p>&#65288;Elaine, can you hear me?)</p>
<p>&#65288;Oh my, Yard-sama? I thought you had left, but where are you?)</p>
<p>(This is a method of speaking from a distance without using a voice. I have one more thing I need to tell you.)</p>
<p>&#65288;Sure, what is it?)</p>
<p>&#65288;In fact, it seems that about two hundred adventurers hired by the Demon Empire are gathering near the forest. We captured a messenger from the Demon Empire a while ago, and it seems that they came to form an alliance with you, and if you don't comply, they were planning to use those adventurers to attack this forest.)</p>
<p>(I see, thank you for the valuable information, but I believe that the elves of Leshiana are not inferior to those adventurers. I'm sure they can be defeated without any help from you.)</p>
<p>(I heard that there are several dragon slayers in the area, and the wood elves would have a hard time facing them.)</p>
<p>(I see. Then I'll take the lead there. I'm sure the kingdom will be relieved if I show them that I'm stronger than the humans of the Demon Empire.)</p>
<p>(That's a nice offer, but we'll send out one of our own as well since it's a good opponent for my apprentice to train with.)</p>
<p>(I understand. Do you know where the adventurers are?)</p>
<p>(That's all right. I'm thinking of making a raid tonight, what do you think?)</p>
<p>(Sure, that's fine. Then please come back at night.)</p>
<p>(I understand. What should we do about the people we captured?)</p>
<p>(I hadn't heard of any messengers from the Demon Empire, so you may do as you please.)</p>
<p>(Okay, I'll see you tonight.)</p>
<p>&#12288;I cut the telepathic and headed down to Elle's. I have to tell her about tonight. I'll keep Alec and the others in the dark. They'll probably go to the adventurers as soon as they hear about it anyway.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle seemed to be outside the hut practicing her no-chanting skills. Apparently, she was very disappointed to have lost to Adriana.</p>
<p>&#12288;From my point of view, I don't think she is inferior to Adriana. I simply believe that she lost because of the difference in experience and her carelessness.</p>
<p>&#12288;I call her up as she is training and tell her about tonight. She was happy to have the opportunity to clear her name and accepted my invitation. Seeing how happy she makes me feel like she's going to let her guard down again, but Elaine will be there this time, so it should be okay.</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, I tried to create a multiple activation technique for the &lt;Ice Lance&gt;, but there seems to be something wrong with the technique and I can't get it to work. What's wrong with it?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Multiple activations, huh. If you're dealing with a large number of people, I think ranged magic is more efficient than single-target magic.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;But at the range, you can't have fine control, so you might miss a shot. It's more reliable to use multiple activations of single target magic.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I need you to be able to at least control the ranged magic normally. I have one magic that will meet your expectations, but it lacks the necessary magic power. If you don't do something about it now, you might fall in one shot.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see. How can I raise the magic power?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's not that easy to raise it, but it can be done, if only temporarily. As it happens, I have everything you need, so I'll give you a special lesson. Come to the warehouse after dinner.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Really!? Thank you very much.&#12301;</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;After that, I passed the time for a while, looking at the magics Elle had created.</p>
<p>&#12288;When the time was right, I stole a look inside the warehouse and saw a woman masturbating while desperately licking a man's cock. Both of them had their lower bodies exposed, and I could see that the woman was already wet.</p>
<p>&#12288;The man's body was tingling from the aphrodisiac, but he couldn't get it up at all. She licks his cock in her mouth to try to get him to cum, but he doesn't respond at all due to the magic I've applied, and he just looks at her with a sad expression.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sorry to keep you waiting, but are you ready for the answer?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I opened the door and walked in, throwing a few words at them. The man glared at me as soon as I walked in, but the woman looked at my lower body for a moment and then hurriedly turned her head away. Smiling at the difference in their reactions, I ignored the man and looked only at the woman.</p>
<p>&#12300;What's the matter, you still can't decide on an answer?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Lily, hurry up and tell this guy. We don't want a lowlife like you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She doesn't want to look at me but turns her head to avoid my gaze. She hugs her body with her arms and closes her legs tightly to avoid being seen, but the tingling in her body seems to be uncontrollable and she grinds her legs together.</p>
<p>&#12288;She tries to pull away from me, but I force her into a hug so that her face is against my chest. I can feel her raspy breath against my chest, and when I stroke her back, which she doesn't try to shake me off, she shivers and shakes.</p>
<p>&#12300;Oi, let go of Lily.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What's the matter? I'm not putting any effort into it, so I'm sure you can shake it off easily. Or don't you like being held by me?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;W-Who would want to be held by you ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She was trying to be strong, but the aphrodisiac should no longer give her any room. I went behind her back and hugged her from behind, but it was clear what she was thinking, judging from the fact that she didn't resist at all.</p>
<p>&#12288;I put my hands inside her clothes and rubbed her breasts with one hand while playing with her crack with the other hand. The place where she had been masturbating earlier reacted sensitively to my fingers. She doesn't want me to stop caressing her, even though she doesn't want to, and it makes my dick boil.</p>
<p>&#12300;You're being very dismissive here, aren't you? I never thought you'd feel it with your enemy's fingers.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm not feeling it......Nnhuuh ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oi, don't touch her. You filthy dog of the kingdom.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;How about it, you're going to want me to put it in there soon. Depending on your attitude, I can put mine in you, okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I also take out my cock and put it against her ass. She shows a little bit of reluctance, but her body wants mine, so she doesn't really try to escape.</p>
<p>&#12288;Here, I use an &lt;<ruby>Thought-Guiding<rt>Guidepost</rt></ruby>&gt; on her and an &lt;Silence&gt; on the man to keep him from interfering.</p>
<p>&#12300;You know the truth, don't you? That your body wants this.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No,......, I'm not that kind of a ......hyuuhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Without letting her finish, I plucked her clit and kneaded it. A little scream escaped, but she kept her mouth shut and struggled to hold back the pleasure.</p>
<p>&#12288;But her mental strength seemed to have weakened because she had been left in a state of limbo. She should be able to move freely, but she doesn't want to get rid of my hand. I take her hand and make her grab my cock.</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahhh, it's hot. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You want me to put this in you, don't you? You don't have to hold back. You've endured enough while being with a man who can't even satisfy one of his women. I'm sure you'll be forgiven for letting a little in.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, I can't. ...... I can't be allowed to. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Then, how about a bare bottom?&#12288;I didn't put it in, so it should be fine.&#12301;<br /></p>
<p>&#12300;I-is that right ......? Then ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I thrust the cock between her closed legs. The thighs were wet with her love juices, so I was able to insert it without much resistance. She had worked out so hard that her legs were well-fleshed, and it felt as if I was really inserting myself.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was rubbing up and down her crack, she seemed to be experiencing a lot of pleasure as well. I don't think she is aware that she has given in to me yet, but her body has already accepted my caresses and become obedient.</p>
<p>&#12288;I can't tell how wonderful it is to feel a sense of conquest as gradually degrade a woman like this.</p>
<p>&#12300;Nooo ...... this is going to be weird ......!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm not like that guy who couldn't get it up when you served him, right?&#12301;<br /></p>
<p>&#12300;......Nnhh&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She seemed to be caring for the man, but secretly she was also disappointed in him. It's true that if a man can't get it up when his girlfriend wants it, she can't help but think he's incapable. I did so, but it must have seemed like a betrayal to her, as she was not thinking straight from the aphrodisiac.</p>
<p>&#12288;While she was off guard, I inserted a little bit of my cock into her. She hurriedly held her crotch with her hand, but I pulled it out of her before she could grab it. She gave me a look as if she wanted to say something about my action.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, my momentum got the better of me. It was an accident.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Y-yeah, ...... if it's an accident, I don't blame you. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;But it felt good, didn't it? Don't be obliging to that guy anymore. He's the kind of guy who doesn't even have an erection, let alone get angry when you're in this state.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;At my words, she also looked at the man. He was glaring at me, but due to the effects of the magic, he couldn't speak, and since he was tied up, he couldn't act out. The thing between his legs was not responding at all to her lasciviousness from earlier, another effect of the magic.</p>
<p>&#12288;I didn't miss the look of disappointment on her face when she looked at the man. I made her remove her gaze from the man again and put the cock to her vaginal hole.</p>
<p>&#12300;You see, he's such a coward that he can't even satisfy you. Why don't you leave your body to me and not hold back anymore?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;But ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't worry, you've endured enough. You don't have to put up with it anymore. No one will blame you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As if to hurry her up, I repeatedly put in and pulled out a little, making her physically aroused. The lack of direct stimulation may have helped her keep her wits about it, but here, I catch up with her all at once.</p>
<p>&#12288;She seemed to be at the end of her patience, and she didn't resist at all, but instead let out a sad sigh and looked at me.</p>
<p>&#12300;Now let me ask you again. Do you obey me?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Yes.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Good answer.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;At last, her heart broke. With her reply, I slammed her hips down as hard as I could and penetrated her vagina with my cock. As if her previous attitude had been a lie, she let out an inarticulate scream and began to shake her hips in time with my movements.</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahhhh, it's feels so gooooood!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You're finally being honest with me. I'll give you a reward.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;This is good, this is feel goooood! Aaaaah!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As she was devouring the pleasure, she didn't seem to care about the man anymore. I guess I gave her too much of the aphrodisiac, but she can't think about anything else but sex anymore.</p>
<p>&#12288;I grabbed her by the thighs, lifted her up, and went in front of the man. When I bring her close so that he can see the joint, the man looks at her with a stunned expression. I release the &lt;Calming&gt;, and in an instant, his cock is boiling and he's done without even touching her.</p>
<p>&#12288;The light of reason is no longer there as the man stares at her lasciviousness. The emotions that had been suppressed until now must have been released at once. He might be screaming, but I can't tell because the &lt;Silence&gt; is still in effect.</p>
<p>&#12288;She doesn't care about the man at all but is greedily shaking her hips and enjoying the pleasure. No matter how many times she climaxes, she still doesn't seem to stop moving.</p>
<p>&#12288;The tightness of her climax made it impossible for me to hold back, and I spit my semen into her. A trickle of semen mixed with her love juice flowed out, staining the man's face.</p>
<p>&#12288;I looked at the man, who was not moving, and realized that he had apparently fainted.</p>
<p>&#12288;After that, I continued to penetrate her as long as time allowed. When I saw the satisfied look on her face after she passed out, I felt a sense of accomplishment that I had broken her so much. So much for playing with the girls.</p>
<p>&#12288;I restrained the unconscious girl again, reapplied the magic seal, and left the scene.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;After dinner, I went with Elle to the warehouse. Inside, the smell of sex remained as it had been earlier, and there were bound and naked men and women lying on the floor. They were unconscious and motionless, with semen and love juice from earlier splattered around them.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle frowned as if she saw something disgusting, but walked in. she walked around, being as careful of her feet as possible. I don't mind getting my shoes dirty, so I just walk as normal, but she doesn't seem to want to step on them.</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, what on earth are you planning to do here?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I told you earlier. I'm going to temporarily raise your magic power. I'm going to use these guys.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Indicate the man and woman with my gaze. I've already made them pay for fighting with me, and Elaine told me to do what I want, so I'm going to do what I want.</p>
<p>&#12288;I explained to Elle the magic I was about to use. It's the first time I've used it in this world, but the difficulty level is not that high, so I'm sure she'll be fine. Elle seemed to understand and nodded her head.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle approached the two collapsed people and drew up a magic circle, then put her hands on their heads and activated the magic. The Fourth Type of Telepathy, the magic power grasping manasize, was activated, and its effect was that all the magic power they had was transferred to Elle.</p>
<p>&#12288;It is a characteristic of this technique that it can temporarily increase the amount of magic power possessed by the magician and its maximum value by the amount of magic power taken away, but the effect lasts for about a day, and the person whose magic power is taken away will permanently lose the amount of magic power taken away.</p>
<p>&#12288;They may have been strong magicians in the Demon Empire, but now that Elle had taken their magic, they could no longer live as magicians. It was bad enough that they got involved with us while we were on a mission, but I'll sympathize with them for their fault.</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, I've taken everything.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It looks like it's done. When I look at the two of them, there is no change in their appearance, but when they wake up, they will realize that all their magic is gone and they will despair. If I were them, I would kill myself.</p>
<p>&#12300;This is amazing. My magic power has more than doubled.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's proof that the maximum amount of magic power you possess is still low. Don't neglect your training in the future.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, Master.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The two of them can no longer use magic, so I also lifted the &lt;<ruby>Magic Sealing<rt>Sigil</rt></ruby>&gt;. The warding and &lt;Lock&gt; should be all that's needed. When I was done with my wild work, I took Elle and headed for Elaine's place.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;When the sun had set and the area was dark, I arrived with Elle at the temple where Elaine was waiting. She was already preparing to go out, and she smiled at us. Her expression had become much more expressive.</p>
<p>&#12288;The fact that she hadn't shown any signs of letting Elle know was probably a sign of her high level of self-control. If it had been Natalia, she would have jumped on me with or without saying a word.</p>
<p>&#12300;We've been waiting for you. Shall we go to the adventurers now?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's a good idea, but if we head out now, we'll be up all night.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You don't have to worry about that.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;After saying that, Elaine activated the magic formula without chanting. A crack in space ran in front of her eyes, and another view was peeking out on the other side. Is this the same kind of magic as my dimensional gate?</p>
<p>&#12288;I was surprised at the chantless, but more than anything, I was surprised that she was able to perform spatial distortion, which I thought was impossible with the magic technology of this world. I was amazed that she could do such a thing, she is a spirit after all.</p>
<p>&#12288;What did she think of my surprise, Elaine denied it with a flapping wave of her hand.</p>
<p>&#12300;The space must be filled with magic power, so it can only be used within the range of Leshiana.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, as expected of High Elf. That alone is beyond my imagination.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;While giving my honest opinion, I quickly went through the crack to the other side. From the immediate vicinity, I can hear what sounds like a group of people making a lot of noise. It was probably a group of adventurers from the Demon Empire.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I watched them making noise around the fire, I noticed that there was a Wood Elf nearby. He was probably planning to shoot them if they tried to enter the forest, but he was brave enough to be alone there.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elaine motioned for the elf to stay back. He had never seen a high elf before, but he recognized her as a high elf at once and followed her instructions to leave deeper into the forest.</p>
<p>&#12300;What should we do?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, can you leave this to me?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle said with a motivating look on her face. I wonder if the problem of multiple activations earlier has been solved. I don't want her to fail in the real thing, so I'll help her out a little this time.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm going to use the Seventh Type of Telepathy Magic, the &lt;Multiple Magic Calculation&gt;. This is a similar effect to the Magic Stampede, where a set number of magics are duplicated and forced to be activated when magic is activated. This eliminates the need to control multiple activations.</p>
<p>&#12288;In the first place, the magic stampede was a mistake that was made while making this, but it was unexpectedly good as disabling magic, so I optimized it as magic.</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, what is the effect of this?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Try firing just one shot of single magic. In this case, I've set it to 200, so it will duplicate the formula for 199 shots.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... If you have such a useful formula, you should have told me about it first!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;This magic can't be applied to yourself, so even if I had taught you, it doesn't make any benefit for you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry to interrupt your conversation, but I think it's time for us to move.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Elaine spoke to me from the side where we were conversing, so I decided it was time to move. I looked at Elle, and she nodded back, moving a little closer to the adventurers and activating her magic.</p>
<p>&#12288;Instantly, the adventurers froze, and then the ice began to tremble and shatter all at once. That's magic that combines the &lt;Ice Statue&gt; and the &lt;Shatter&gt;. Most of the adventurers must have died from the attack.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, there were still some adventurers with high resistance to the magic who were not completely frozen. But most of them seemed to be unable to move, their arms and legs shattered. Only three of them were able to stand up.</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't hide there, get out of there!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It seemed that our whereabouts had been discovered. I lifted the spell on Elle and stepped out of the forest. Two men look like swordsmen and one in a magician's robe. Two of them are completely unaffected by Elle's &lt;Ice Statue&gt;, which froze even Adriana, and apparently, these guys are the dragon slayers.</p>
<p>&#12300;I was surprised that you suddenly attacked me. The people of Leshiana seem to have some pretty despicable ideas.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;If you're an adventurer, you should at least be prepared to die at any time. And neither I nor the person who just attacked you are from Leshiana.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Does that mean you're from the Kingdom? It would be unfortunate news for the Demon Empire that Leshiana was already on the side of the kingdom. Let's at least bring back the heads of the High Elves and the Kingdom's people as a souvenir.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Do you think that three adventurers can bring down Leshiana? You're very confident, aren't you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The other party may be speaking in the imperial language, and both Elle and Elaine are just looking at the other party in silence. It's a very uncomfortable scene, but the other party is a dragon slayer, so I can't let my guard down.</p>
<p>&#12300;Elaine, I'll leave you in charge of the man I'm talking to. Elle, you take the other two.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Sure, I understand.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, Master.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The man is still saying something, but the two of them ignore him and start attacking. Two against one is tough, so I decide to stop the other one until the first one is defeated.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle ran into the magician-looking guy. I wanted to watch the battle, but one of the remaining ones was coming towards me, so I had no choice but to face him. He seemed to be a light warrior type and was wearing leather armor.</p>
<p>&#12300;It looks like you're my opponent. How dare a magician like you stand in my way?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What, you're confident against a magician?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, no matter how fast a magician chants, they will be cut in half before they can chant in front of my sword speed. In other words, you don't stand a chance as soon as I get close to you!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No need to introduce yourself. If you're going to do this, why don't you do it quickly?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;While he's talking, I activate the &lt;Illusion&gt;. Instantly, the man stands there with a stunned expression on his face. I guess it's okay to watch Elle now.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I looked at Elaine first, I saw that her opponent had already been pierced by several tree roots and was dying. She put on a cool face, but it was the result of a vast difference in ability.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I looked at Elle, I saw that her opponent was putting up a good fight. The sorceress seemed to be using fire as his main weapon, and Elle, who was dutifully guarding the forest, was not avoiding the attacks but offsetting them, which probably reduced the number of attacks somewhat.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, her opponent does not seem to have as much combat experience as Adriana. It seems that he is challenging Elle to a head-to-head battle in terms of the number of magics, but it is wrong for someone who uses the chant to challenge Elle in terms of the number of magics. He should have just stayed quiet and aimed for the forest. Sure enough, he has pushed further and further away, and in the end, he was pierced by an ice spear and died.</p>
<p>&#12300;Elle, this one's next.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I show her the next opponent without giving her time to rest. She's breathing a little, but I think she'll be okay. As Elle approached, I backed away from the man and released the magic. The man who had come back to himself was looking around, searching for me, but when he saw Elle coming, he turned to face her.</p>
<p>&#12300;It seems that the man from earlier was all talk. I didn't expect him to run away without a fight.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... I have no idea what you're saying.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Are you Dark Elf? I don't know why you're on the side of the kingdom, but shame on you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm saying I don't understand. It can't be helped.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When Elle suddenly unleashed her &lt;Ice Lance&gt; at the man who was talking to her, the man evaded it with a faster-than-expected move. He runs straight into Elle and cuts at her. Elle prevented this by creating a wall of ice and activating her &lt;Ice Statue&gt; in return.</p>
<p>&#12288;It was a good match, but Elle seemed to have the upper hand. She shoots a magic formula on the assumption that the opponent will evade it, and draws a magic circle on the ground. She seems to be imitating Adriana.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I looked at the formulas she was drawing, I realized what she was going to use. Apparently, Elle is the type of person who can't see what's going on around her during battle. What she was going to use was wide and indiscriminate magic.</p>
<p>&#12288;I hurriedly took Elaine's hand and took refuge in the forest. She didn't say a word even though she was suddenly being pulled, just a slight look of wonder on her face, and she followed me quietly.</p>
<p>&#12288;The moment we evacuated into the forest, Elle's magic circle was completed, and she activated it immediately. The Fourth Type of Material Creation Magic, the &lt;Frozen Hell&gt;, was activated, and a violent snowstorm was generated from the magic circle to cover the entire surrounding area. The snow that covered the man, along with the corpses around him, immediately froze and blocked his movement. When the blizzard eventually subsided, there was an object of a man whose entire body was covered with snow and ice.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elaine was looking at her with admiration, but I couldn't understand why she would use such a range of magic on one person. I wonder if she has a habit of wanting to shoot such a wide range of magic from time to time, even though she had said that she preferred to fire multiple single magics even against a group.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle, who had used the &lt;Shatter&gt; to shatter the man's object into pieces, came running towards us.</p>
<p>&#12300;How was it? I think I was able to fight better than before.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Think about the damage around you a little more. If we had just watched it happen, even we would have been involved.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... I'm sorry.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She seems to be remorseful, but it's meaningless if she doesn't use it as a lesson. For now, let's hope for the future.</p>
<p>&#12288;Now that we've wiped out the adventurers and done our business here, Elle and I head back to the hut, leaving the cleanup to the elves who came to check on us.</p>
