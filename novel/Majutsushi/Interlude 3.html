<h3>Interlude &#8211; Alec&#12305; ~A man named Yard~</h3>

<p>&#12288;To put it bluntly, I wasn't keen on forming an alliance with the elven nation, Leshiana.</p>
<p>&#12288;I had no choice to refuse as I had been ordered by the king, but still I felt as if he was implying that I could not protect the kingdom with my power alone, and inwardly I was burning with humiliation.</p>
<p>&#12288;Yes, the role of the hero is to take the lead in defeating the enemy. Negotiations should be left to other people. This kind of humble task is not something that a heroes would do.</p>
<p>&#12288;In addition, on the way, Yard took the liberty of accepting another request. I was also annoyed that Sagami was so eager to take it on. They were just an add-on to me, so they should have just followed me quietly.</p>
<p>&#12288;We arrived at Leshiana, and the attitude of the elves here was quite barbaric. It was not the kind of behavior you would expect to the emissaries of a country. It was extremely frustrating to deal with someone who had no sense of propriety, but I had to endure this until the negotiations were over.</p>
<p>&#12288;But when the negotiations began, they were a disaster. Elaine, the representative of Leshiana, refused to listen to my proposal, and although her words were polite, she spoke as if I were a fool. It seems that it was unreasonable to try to form an alliance with a savage people who don't even have a status system.</p>
<p>&#12288;I was not at fault in any way, but I could not bear the thought of leaving without fulfilling the royal order. Just as I was thinking this, Yard asked me to give up my role as a negotiator. At first, I listened to him, wondering "who do you think you are", but it seemed that he wanted me to take all the credit.</p>
<p>&#12288;This man is a man who knows what he's talking about. Even when I was in the fortress, he saw the hidden power in my sword and passed it on to me to create an opportunity for me to play an active role. If he was a coward, he would have kept quiet here, but he knows his place. That's what makes him different from the other two.</p>
<p>&#12288;And I don't know how he did it, but he made an alliance. I wondered if he had any other outrageous conditions, but there were none, and it was an alliance of equals.</p>
<p>&#12288;Since he had kicked us out, I was sure there was a personal transaction. Perhaps a physical relationship. He and the High Elf had spent some time alone together. The savages would have preferred a straightforward and direct benefit. I don't have a taste for holding non-humans, so such negotiations are impossible for me.</p>
<p>&#12288;As long as I've done my job, I'll leave those things out of it. A man who understands his position is of great value. I'll indulge him a little. I hope you will continue to benefit for me.</p>
