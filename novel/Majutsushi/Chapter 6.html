<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; 6: The Battle is Over, Peace is Far Away</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6.1</strong></p>

<p>&#12300;I'm thinking of buying a mansion.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Tia's eyes widened, unsure of how to react to my sudden words.</p> <p>&#12288;It's been a month since I moved to this world, and I'm still being taken care of in the castle. There is no shortage of things to do in my daily life, but I am limited in what I can do. It's about time I had a place of my own.</p> <p>&#12288;To tell you the truth, I want a laboratory and a storage room. So far I've been keeping them in my luggage bag, but now that I've got the samples, I have nowhere to put them.</p> <p>&#12300;A mansion is it? That's a good idea. All the noble families have their own mansions in the capital, apart from the ones in the countryside, and since master is now a Associate-baron, I'm sure they won't have any objections for Master to have a mansion.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yeah, I can't be bother in this castle forever, and I can't keep any more things in this room. Buying a mansion is good, but is it something that can be bought so casually?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Well, first of all, a nobleman's mansion can only be built in a noble district, and the place to build the mansion and the size of the mansion are determined by the rank of the nobleman. In the case of master, you're a Associate-baron, so you can have your mansion in the Eastern District.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I've heard that there's a noble district, but to think that the land you can live in changes depending on your rank, that's quite a troublesome. Well, I guess we have to understand that aristocracy is a race that values appearances.</p> <p>&#12300;Also, if you want to build a mansion, you'll need the king's permission and a letter of introduction from another nobleman. Even if you want to buy a second-hand property, you need the king's permission, so if you're interested in buying a mansion, you'd better apply for a meeting as soon as possible.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I see, it's not so easy to get it after all. But.......if I ask for a visit now, do you know when it will be?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;If it is master's rank, it would normally take about a month, but since the heroes are to be given as much preferential treatment as possible, I think it will take about two days at the latest to get a meeting.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I see, I've never had the benefit of this before, but hearing that makes me think that heroes are special. Well, since the heroes didn't have the option to refuse when they were summoned to this world in the first place, I'd say it's only natural to give them preferential treatment.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Does the master come to hate this world ......?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;When Tia heard my words, she asked me in a sad voice. This was a bit of a misunderstanding.</p> <p>&#12300;The fact that I was summoned is not a good thing in itself, but I consider myself lucky to have met you because of it. So please don't look so sad.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I really mean this. In my original world, I wasn't a very social person, so I didn't have many friends I could trust.</p> <p>&#12300;Master ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Tia gazes at me, her eyes moist with emotion. It's fine to watch her like that, but I urge her to continue since we've just had a break in the conversation.</p> <p>&#12300;If master is planning to buy the mansion, I will arrange it for you, what do you want to do?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, for now, I'll ask Sophie and then think about it. Maybe we can have an immediate meeting.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I thought about it and went to ask Sophie, but instead of a meeting, she told me that she would ask the king for permission and that I should choose a mansion first. Apparently, she was also concerned that I didn't have a mansion.</p> <p>&#12288;I've been told not to worry about it because she's going to go get permission for the other heroes as well, but I think it would be better to thank her later.</p> <p>&#12288;You'd think how great a hero would be to have the princess of a country as his errand girl, but,&nbsp;It's also true that I want a mansion, so I'll be honest and let her do me a favor here.</p> 			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p> 			<p>&#12288;I immediately left the castle to go choosing a mansion. I brought along a guide and Tia as my companions. Elle wanted to come with me, but it was still too dangerous for her to walk around the city and she didn't have any knowledge of noble houses, so I decided to keep her at home this time.</p> <p>&#12288;I heard that noblemen usually travel by carriage, but since carriages are uncomfortable to ride in, I decided to ride on a horse, which I am not very good at, as a compromise.</p> <p>&#12288;The eastern part of the city was visible from the royal palace, so I knew the general location. It was not too far from the castle to walk there. Since there is a commoner's quarter nearby, it seems that is not very popular by nobility, and only knights who don't have estates and Associate-barons like me live there.</p> <p>&#12288;When I arrived at the site, I immediately chose a mansion. It seemed to be true that the area was unpopular, and while the other areas were more lively, this one was quiet as if no one lived there. I was grateful for the quietness, though.</p> <p>&#12288;We entered the east district and stopped in front of a mansion a little further down the street. It looked quite new, but it seemed to be a vacant property.</p> <p>&#12300;What do you think of this place? The previous owner had sold it due to financial difficulties, but the building itself is not very old, and it's also the largest mansion the Associate-baron could own.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;As I listened to the guide explain the mansion to me, I observed the surrounding buildings, but the others seemed to be vacant as well. I can see that it's not popular, but it's a shame really.</p> <p>&#12288;The house is not that far from the royal palace, so it will be convenient in case of emergency. The garden is large and could be used for something. The only thing that remained to be seen was how the house itself would look like.</p> <p>&#12300;Does it have a basement?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Let's see, ...... yes, it has a basement. In addition, there are a sufficient number of rooms for servants, and there is also a windowless room that can be used for the research you mentioned, Associate-baron.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I see. Are there any other properties with similar conditions to this one?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;This house is the best property, and the other houses are only inferior to this one. ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I asked Tia if that was so, and she told me that from her point of view, the mansion was indeed a very nice place. The price was about half of what I had received last time, so it was more than enough to pay.</p> <p>&#12288;I'm not sure what the price of the mansion is, so I'm leaving it up to Tia, but she said it was a bargain and that it was okay, so I guess it really is okay.</p> <p>&#12288;We went inside and were shown around the house, and other than the piles of dust, there was nothing particularly wrong with the place, and it looked like it could be lived in right now after some cleaning.</p> <p>&#12300;All right, I'll take this place.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Okay, then I'll take care of the rest of the procedures here. You can start recruiting servants now.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Master, I'll choose a suitable servant for you, so why don't you go around the town and see what you can find?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I see, I can get by even if I leave everything to others. If that's the case, I'll just walk around the town.</p> <p>&#12288;I hadn't been able to buy or eat anything in the castle, so I thought I'd give it a try for the first time in a while, so I left my horse in Tia's hands and headed for the commoner's quarter on foot.</p> 			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p> 			<p>&#12300;You're Yard Werner, aren't you?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;As I was walking through the town, buying and eating at the stalls on the main street, I was suddenly entangled by a woman.</p> <p>&#12288;The clothes she was wearing didn't seem to be of the highest quality, but judging from her fair skin and hair, which looked like she had never done any housework before, she must be a noblewoman, and a pretty high one at that. I don't think she was a commoner by any stretch of the imagination.</p> <p>&#12288;She has the typical appearance of a noblewoman with blond hair and blue eyes, but I have no idea what she looks like. She is probably less than twenty years old, and she is wearing clothes that would be very popular with men, so she is probably the daughter of a nobleman who has fallen into prostitution or something.</p> <p>&#12288;But I have an idea of who would want to get involved with me on the street like this. First of all, I'm sure it's someone related to Dian. I don't know of anyone else who would want to hurt me.</p> <p>&#12288;It's reasonable to assume that she's here to take revenge for Dian's case. But if that's the case, she would have stabbed me before she called out to me, but what the hell?</p> <p>&#12288;I guess she got tired of me ignoring her words and keeping quiet, so she crowded in on me.</p> <p>&#12300;My name is Lucia, I was the concubine of Duke Dian. Because of you, Dian has been imprisoned and his title has been taken away. When I returned to my parents' home, they treated me like a plague and finally kicked me out. I want you to take responsibility for this.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;What the hell is this woman talking about? I was the one who caused Dian to have his title taken away, but in the end, it was because he was in cooperation with the Demon Empire that he was at fault, not me. Why should I help his people?</p> <p>&#12288;At any rate, I moved towards the alleyway so as not to disturb the passersby. This woman was cornered, and there was no telling what she might do. I had a feeling that I might get into trouble if I was seen.</p> <p>&#12300;I'm sorry, but if you have any complaints about the Duke's family being taken down, please take it up with the country, not me. I'm the victim of a wrongful accusation by ex-Duke Dian, and he deserved what happened to him when his title was taken away.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;If it weren't for you, he wouldn't have resorted to such strong-arm tactics!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Are we not on the same page? As long as I'm not at fault, there's no reason for me to listen to your plea. In the first place, he had committed the felony of informing the Demon Empire. He should be held directly responsible for any disadvantage caused by Dian's downfall.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;As I was about to leave, she walked around in front of me. What a depressing woman, it seems that she's Dian's concubine for real. She's a lot like him in this way.</p> <p>&#12300;I don't have time to worry about you, though. Can you make way for me?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;If you don't listen to me, I'll take off my clothes and scream right here.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;She even threatened me at last. I could try to see if she can really do it, but I don't want to, because in such a case, the woman's opinion is likely to be advantageous. I don't want to be accused of a crime I didn't commit.</p> <p>&#12300;What responsibility do you want me to take?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Please come up with a sum of money that will allow me to live a comfortable life. Since my life was ruined because of you, I want you to show me this much sincerity.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;If you want that much money, you should sell yourself to a brothel. As I said before, there is no reason for me to take care of you. You can play the victim all you want, but don't try to force it on me.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;How can you say such an outrageous thing as selling myself to a brothel!?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;After all, it's for living expenses. She must have been a daughter of a good family to be able to become the concubine of a Duke, but thanks to that, she was useless, unable to earn her own money when she was kicked out of the house.</p> <p>&#12288;She was not bad-looking, and I think she would be popular if she became a prostitute, but I don't think she was even ready for that. On top of that, she was an irredeemable idiot who demanded money from me, Duke's victim.</p> <p>&#12288;As I was about to leave, I heard a rustling behind me. I turned around to see her taking off her clothes. I was a little taken aback because I didn't think she would actually do it. If she had the guts to strip naked on the street, she could probably get a normal job, I thought to myself.</p> <p>&#12288;I hurriedly stopped her and she hugged me, still half naked. To the casual observer, we looked like a couple in heat in a back alley, but in reality, the situation was not that sweet.</p> <p>&#12300;Let go of me, if someone comes, they'll think I'm crazy.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I don't want to! I'm not letting you go until you promise to help me!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;What a troublesome woman. I don't know how Dian managed to get her to be his wife. I was about to use the &lt;Fear&gt; because it was getting a little depressing, but then I thought of a better idea.</p> <p>&#12288;Well, if you want me to take responsibility, I will. You'll become my maid and experimental subject. I'm just about to buy a new mansion, and the more workers we have, the better, even for this idiot.</p> <p>&#12300;It can't be helped, even if I were to help you, the only thing I can offer you is to allow you to work in my mansion. You won't be able to live like you used to, but is that okay with you?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, it's still better than falling into prostitution. I beg you.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;She listened to my words and finally let me go. No one said that I would work her as a maid. I'm literally going to use her body to help me with the experiments.</p> <p>&#12288;I dressed her, gave her some money and a key, told her where the mansion was, told her to say hello to Tia, and sent her on her way.</p> <p>&#12288;After making sure she left, I went back to the castle.</p> 			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p> 			<p>&#12288;When I returned to the castle and told Sophie about the mansion, she seemed to have already gotten permission and handed me a letter from the king.</p> <p>&#12288;She asked me about the mansion, and when I told her where it was and what I remembered about it, she said she wanted to visit me later, but I refused. A princess does not go to visit a single man who is not her fiancé.</p> <p>&#12288;The next day I received a report that the formalities of the mansion had been completed, so I decided to take Elle and head there as soon as possible. Tia told me that she had finished selecting the servants and would be waiting for me at the mansion.</p> <p>&#12288;When we arrived at the mansion, we found that they had already finished cleaning the front of the house. As I entered the house, I found Tia and a group of men and women who looked like servants waiting in line. Among them was Lucia.</p> <p>&#12300;Welcome back, master.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yeah, are all the servants here?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, I gathered them in a hurry, but they were all hired by some family. Their skills are solid, so don't worry. Do you need an introduction?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, please do.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I was introduced to everyone, including Kurt, the butler, but I couldn't remember that many names. After the introductions, I asked them to go back to their work, but I stopped Lucia.</p> <p>&#12300;What can I do for you, sir?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I've prepared another job for you. Just follow me for now.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I headed for the basement with a quizzical Lucia and Elle in tow. The door here is thick metal and soundproofed. I don't know what kind of hobby the person who built this mansion had, but he left me with just the right one.</p> <p>&#12288;In the basement, there was a table on which hands and feet could be restrained, and around it were instruments for torture. When Lucia saw this, her expression tightened and she tried to run away, but Elle, who was standing behind her, caught her.</p> <p>&#12300;What are you guys trying to do to me?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Don't worry, I don't intend to torture you because you are Dian's concubine and I hate you. I just want you to cooperate with our experiments. I chose this room because this table is just convenient for what I'm about to do. Elle, take off her clothes and secure her to the table.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Elle fixed her as instructed, and then took out the tools she would be using. It's just a brush and some ink for drawing a simple magic formula. This is what we will use to draw the formula on her body.</p> <p>&#12288;She doesn't seem to understand what Elle's doing when she sees the tools. She doesn't seem to know what she's supposed to do, but even if she did, there's nothing she can do about it.</p> <p>&#12300;Elle, you start from the bottom. It's an important body, so don't do anything rash.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, I should do what I heard yesterday, right?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yeah, it'll probably get out of control, so be careful.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;What the hell are you guys trying to do with all these restraints?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Ignoring her words and start writing immediately. Let's start with her hands. From the tips of her fingers to her shoulders, she write down the magic formula to converge the magic power.</p> <p>&#12300;Hey, what did you do to me!? Hey, answer me, ouch!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Incidentally, the ink for the magic formula reacts dramatically with human magic power, so when you touch it, it feels like boiling water. In addition, it penetrates the skin, so it won't come off even if you wash it, and it won't even blot no matter how much you wipe it off. The only way to remove this ink is to cut off the painted area.</p> <p>&#12300;Master, what about the nails?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Don't worry about the nails, paint the other parts first. Start with the tips.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;It hurts-it hurts-it hurts! Stop, please!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Lucia is in pain, but of course Elle has no intention of stopping. Now that I've finished drawing the shoulder, I'll move on to the other arm. Elle is still in the middle of one leg, but I decide to proceed without worrying about it.</p> <p>&#12300;Aaaaahhhh! Stooop iiiiiitttt!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;You're making too much noise. Be quiet for a minute.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;When Elle starts to write on her thighs, she flails wildly and resists, so I slap her cheek to calm her down. The pain is so great that she is incontinent. I wiped off the wetness and started writing again, more and more.</p> <p>&#12300;Forgive me, forgive meeeeee!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;It can't be helped. ...... Elle, I'll draw for you too, just hold her down.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, Master.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;For a while, she was crying out loud, but then she stopped resisting, and her only reaction was to occasionally bounce her body. Now that it was easier to draw, I finished it all at once.</p> <p>&#12288;After finishing the arms and legs, I started on the face. She seemed to have run out of energy to scream, and her mouth was moaning unintelligibly. As I finished drawing on her chest and stomach, Elle also finished drawing her lower body.</p> <p>&#12288;When she stopped moving, I turned her over and wrote the same thing. When she stopped responding, I thought she was dead and checked her condition, but her heart seemed to be beating, so I was relieved and continued my work.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6.2</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;It was two hours later when the full body treatment was over. I was expecting for her to die of shock at least once, but it seems that her nerves are a little thick. This would allow her to withstand the next round of experiments.</p>
<p>&#12288;It doesn't matter how many times she dies physically, but if her mind is broken, it will take a lot of time to fix it. If possible, I would like her to remain unbroken until the end of her life.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was waiting for her to regain consciousness after giving her physical healing, I felt a glance from next to me.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I looked back, I noticed that Elle was looking at me, and she looked like she had something to say.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I looked closer, I saw that Elle was sticking her finger inside Lucia's vagina. What is she doing all of a sudden? I'm not sure if she saw the confused look on my face or not, but she quickly pulled her finger out.</p>
<p>&#12300;This woman's vagina is quite narrow, isn't it?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, her body is small, so the size of her vagina must be appropriate. So, what the hell are you trying to say?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, why don't you hold her before you make the magic stone? The wider the vagina, the better it will be for the experiment.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;But why should I do it while she's unconscious?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Even if she didn't want to do it, you were going to force the experiment, right? If that's the case, you don't have to worry about her intentions even now.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Fumu... ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Certailny, that I was going to try it on a human or similar species first before letting her be a demon, but I hadn't thought about whether her body could withstand intercourse. I'll take Elle's suggestion at this point.</p>
<p>&#12300;That's right. If it doesn't interfere with the experiment, I'll hold her once.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Then I'll make the restraints a little tighter. Master, please do as you wish.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle said, and began to tighten the restraints that were still attached to Lucia. She probably didn't think that she would be raped while unconscious.</p>
<p>&#12288;With the restraints on her hands and torso tighter than before, I grabbed Lucia's legs and spread her legs.</p>
<p>&#12288;I wondered if the lack of hair was due to the fact that she was shaved, or if it was just that she never had any. Either way, it returned a smooth touch.</p>
<p>&#12300;This was the first time I'd ever fucked an unconscious woman.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I put my finger in her crack, but of course there was no sign that she was the least bit wet. I can't blame her for being unconscious, but I can't insert my finger if it's not wet. At any rate, I try to stimulate her flesh buds with my fingers as if I were playing with them.</p>
<p>&#12300;Mmmm ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She made a faint sound in response to the stimulation. Apparently her body responds even when she is unconscious.</p>
<p>&#12288;While playing with her vulva with my index finger, I kneaded the bud with my thumb. I used my other hand to squeeze her unfortunate breasts, and she unconsciously tightened her vagina. It seems that she is feeling it.</p>
<p>&#12300;Aah......Uunnn......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;She is very responsive even though she is unconscious. She doesn't seem to have much experience with intercourse, though. She's a slut by nature.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Nnuuuuhhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When I pinched up her nipples, she jumped up and down, screaming loudly. The fingers in her vagina were also quite tight. Her love juices came out of her vagina are overflowing. She seemed to feel it even in pain.</p>
<p>&#12288;Now that she was wet enough, I was ready to insert into her, but the restraints were in the way and I couldn't lift her up. The restraints were superfluous, since she didn't flail about in her unconscious state.</p>
<p>&#12300;Elle, remove the restraints.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, Master.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;While Elle quickly removed the restraints on Lucia, I took off my clothes and went up to the platform. While sitting on the platform, I lifted up Lucia's small, unrestrained body, placed her vulva against my cock, and slowly lowered it.</p>
<p>&#12288;She wasn't a virgin, as Elle had said, but her vagina was as tight as a virgin's.</p>
<p>&#12288;To see how far in I could go, I pushed her thighs and forced the rod deeper, but before I could get it all the way in, I felt what felt like the opening of her uterus. It seemed that her vagina was generally small.</p>
<p>&#12300;Fuuhh, NNhh, aaahhhhh.....&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Even in her unconscious state, she seemed to be getting a good amount of pleasure, and she was making sweet noises as she accepted my load. I thought the pain would be stronger if it was this hard, but seeing the lack of pain on her face, I guess it was unwarranted.</p>
<p>&#12288;I held her so she wouldn't fall, and slowly moved my cock inside her to accustom her to the size of my cock.</p>
<p>&#12300;Auhh ...... good, hmmm ...... ahh ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I could see that she was also unconsciously seeking the rod, leaking out her voice and tightening up with each thrust, and when I tried to pull out, she let out a loonging sigh.</p>
<p>&#12288;I was tempted to go harder and watch her lasciviousness as she felt it unconsciously, but I restrained myself and kept my movements slow.</p>
<p>&#12288;After a while, the tightness inside her gradually loosened up to the point where she could accept my cock without difficulty.</p>
<p>&#12300;Good, aahh, Nnhuuhh, mmmmm ...... haahnn ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Her vagina was tightening, as if she was instinctively seeking pleasure, even though she was unconscious. She may have a constitution that allows her to feel easily, but the blue streaks all over her body make her look like a whore who lures men.</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, if you're feeling it, I don't need to hold back now.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahh ...... huff! HyaaAAaah!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Once I pulled my cock out of her, I penetrated her deeply at once. She felt a shock that was an order of magnitude greater than anything she had ever felt before, and even though she was supposed to be unconscious, she was screaming. At this rate, she would probably wake up soon.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm going to make sure she's okay with this intense.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Unlike my previous movements where I was concerned about her, I was thrusting hard as if I was treating her like a mere animal. Maybe I was in a hurry because I had been moving so slowly.</p>
<p>&#12288;I thrust up her petite body and repeatedly placed the tip of my cock against her cervix. I could feel her unconscious body shaking like a doll.</p>
<p>&#12300;Hahhnnn! Auuhhh! AaaAAaahhh!&#12288;...... Ah, Eh!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You're awake. Sorry to interrupt your sleep, but we're just getting started.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Eh, what, fuwahhhhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The impact on her body woke up Lucia, but I didn't care and continued to fuck her in the same manner without worrying about it.</p>
<p>&#12300;No, pull it out! Please pull it out, HyaAAahhhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hou~? But your insides are tightening up so that I can't get out, you know?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's not true, uuUUuhnnn! You're wrong! I-it's your... ahhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, if you want to pull it out, you can do it yourself. You can do that without any restraints, can't you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well then, hmm! S-Somehow ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's also a service. If you can pull it out, I'll end it here.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When she heard that, she was desperately trying to lift her hips off of me, using her still-strengthened arms for support.</p>
<p>&#12288;I could feel her desperation from the look on her face, so I stopped thrusting inside her and watched her for a while as she tried to pull out my cock with all her strength.</p>
<p>&#12300;I-I'm almost there. ...... Mmmm ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, it's about time.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Slowly, but gradually, the rod slipped out, and when it was almost all the way out, I grabbed her by the waist and pulled her down at once.</p>
<p>&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;&#8213;! HyaAaaaAahhh!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She had just relaxed, believing that she was almost there, when I took advantage of that moment and gave her the biggest shock of the day. It was much more effective than a normal rape.</p>
<p>&#12288;She screamed and stretched her body to climax at my surprise. Her insides were as tight as they had been when I started to fuck her, and she squirted, flooding the table.</p>
<p>&#12300;What's the matter, I didn't say I wouldn't interfere, you know?</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahh, ahh, ahh ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I don't know if she can even hear my words, but her eyes are wide open and she's just repeating meaningless sounds like a broken radio.</p>
<p>&#12300;You can't afford to have it broken like this, okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Please ...... forgive me ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She may have reached her mental limit, as she shed tears and pleaded with me, but in my opinion, her spirit is still strong. She was mentally strong enough to endure the treatment she had just received, so she would not be crippled by this.</p>
<p>&#12288;I grabbed her hips again and lifted her up, thrusting my load into her vagina again in the same way. She screams again from the shock and pleasure of it. As I repeated this, her expression gradually became more and more debauched.</p>
<p>&#12300;Mmmmmmmmm!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You've come to feel even this. You've got a pretty slutty body.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;N-no this is different!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, it's not. It seems that your body was originally very sensitive to pleasure, but after the treatment you just received, your senses have become more sensitive.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;W-What do you mean by that?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;This is what I mean.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ii, aaaAAaAaahhhhh!!&#12301;</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/F3hdwNE.jpg"></img>

			<p>&#12288;When I pinched her erect nipples, she turned away and climaxed in an interesting way.</p>
<p>&#12288;Even her skin, which had been made sensitive by the treatment she had just undergone, would not react this way to a mere pinch.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, the imprint on her allows her to feel the flow of magic power as her pleasure, so if I play with her while letting the magic flow, I can see an extreme reaction.</p>
<p>&#12300;F-Forgive me!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I want to let it out soon too. so I'm going to have to reject that suggestion.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As soon as I finished saying the words, I grabbed her and gave her a hard pistoning motion like before. Just playing with her nipples is enough to make her tighten up inside her vagina, and I'm getting close to my limit.</p>
<p>&#12300;Aah, aah! Ah, ah-ah, aaahhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm almost at my limit, I'm coming inside!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Nooo, AhAahhhhh! Inside is, don't cum insideeeee! Ah, aaahhHHhhhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I grabbed her hips and thrust as deep as I could, pouring my semen into her.</p>
<p>&#12288;Her vagina was too narrow for my semen to flow out. I thrust so hard that it hit her uterus, and I thought it might have gone directly into her womb.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I pulled the rod out of Lucia, who climaxed again at the same time as me, she collapsed on the table, losing my support, and was jittery for a while, basking in the afterglow of her climax.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;After a while, she got up and was immensely surprised when she finally noticed the change in her body. Apparently, the problem was that it looked like a tattoo. I later learned that in this country, tattoos are reserved for the lower class, such as prostitutes and slaves, and are considered an object of contempt for those above the middle class.</p>
<p>&#12300;I can't walk around like this anymore. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't worry, you won't be walking around the streets anymore. If someone sees that imprint on your skin and recognizes it as a magic, you and I will be in a bit of trouble.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What? Why is that ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It seems that human experimentation is not allowed in this country, and most people have an aversion to such activities. No matter how much I have a grudge against Dian's people, I'm pretty sure I'll be treated as a heretic first.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It's already been decided that I'm going to keep her inside the mansion. In truth, there was another reason why I didn't want to let her out, but I didn't mention it.</p>
<p>&#12288;It would be better not to tell her in detail that Lucia's value has increased incredibly for those who have knowledge of magic.</p>
<p>&#12288;Well, now I've taken care of everything regarding her. I can leave the rest to Tia and let her do her maid work.</p>
<p>&#12288;After I'm done with the mansion, I wonder if I should go see the elves that are said to be in this country, or if I should check out the magic tools.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I looked to the side, I was struck by the despairing expression on Lucia's face as she realized that she was finished as a nobleman and as a person, and the envious look on Elle's face as she watched her.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;Lucia has been working as a maid since then. Her housekeeping skills were hopeless, but she would improve in time.</p>
<p>&#12288;And now, I was lying on my desk in the laboratory of the mansion I had finally acquired, groaning. There are so many failed magic tools lying around that I can barely find my footing.</p>
<p>&#12300;I didn't realize that granted magic was this difficult. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;There is the sound of construction going on outside. It was a good thing that I had bought a mansion, but I had completely forgotten that I was missing something important.</p>
<p>&#12288;Yes, a bath.</p>
<p>&#12288;In this world, even the nobles didn't use baths, and only wiped their bodies.</p>
<p>&#12288;The concept of hygiene in this world was surprisingly developed. I was impressed by the fact that they had toilets and sewers, but the idea of building a place to wash the body did not seem to have occurred to them.</p>
<p>&#12288;The commoners basically had to choose between fetching water from wells or rivers, not using magic tools to make water. They don't use magic tools to make water. Magic tools are too expensive for commoners to afford.</p>
<p>&#12288;I heard that castles and high-ranking noblemen's residences use magic tools, but the price and maintenance costs are so high that it is difficult for a lower-ranking nobleman, much less a baron, to use them.</p>
<p>&#12288;But that's just for people who can't use magic. In this world, there are magical tools that can make water, and I know how to make water. So, I thought, <span style="font-style: italic;">why don't I just make it myself</span>, and I immediately made some prototypes.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, although I tried to make them, I couldn't make anything that could withstand practical use.</p>
<p>&#12288;The problem that I'm currently stumbling over is that if I try to produce a large amount of water, the magic tool itself will break. The only thing it can do is to release a small amount of drinking water, and there's no way it can fill a bath with this kind of thing.</p>
<p>&#12288;I thought it would be easy to make a magic tool if it was one of the magics, but the result was as you can see. No matter how confident I was in my magic, it was wrong to challenge a field I was not specialized in without any education.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, there are things that I have learned from my mistakes. In this case, I should get one of the actual items and use it as an example.</p>
<p>&#12288;Fortunately, I had already found out about a store that dealt in magic tools. I don't have any money on me, but it would be free just to look at the exhibits. I can't stand the thought of living without a bath any longer, so I'm prepared to resort to hard measures if the need arises.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>6.3</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;The store I was looking for was located on the main street of the town. It looked no different from any other store, but if you looked closely at the flow of magic power, you would see that it was carefully warded for security. There is no way that the wards are put up by human power, so it must be a store that has magical tools that put up wards and expensive products that are worth using.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I entered the store, I found that the store's sign was not a fluke, and there were various kinds of magic tools on display. There are huge magical items that can put up wards, and there are even magical items for self-defense that double as accessories.</p>
<p>&#12288;I wondered how much it would be worth if I sold them all. I was impressed by the variety of items, which made me think that if I were not good enough, I might have more money than a high class aristocrat.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, the only thing I'm looking for this time is a magic tool that produces hot water, which is too limited, so there are two magic tools, a magic tool that produces water and a magic tool that warms water. I have no use for anything other than those items. I wandered around the store and found what I was looking for.</p>
<p>&#12288;The price of both items was about the same as my house. This was too expensive. I would have been willing to buy them if they were cheap, but these prices made me wonder if I was being ripped off.</p>
<p>&#12288;A man who seemed to be a shopkeeper approached me, probably having found me groaning in front of the magic tools.</p>
<p>&#12300;Welcome to the store. Is that the magic tool you're looking for?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, how much water can this magic tool produce?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That magical tool can produce enough water to fill two barrels of wine in an hour. I don't think you can find anything with such a powerful effect in any other store.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Two barrels of wine equals about one thousand nine hundred liters. If it can produce that much, a bath of that size should be fine. However, the baths I'm having made at the mansion are not of such a small scale, so I need something that can produce more water.</p>
<p>&#12300;I see, is there anything more powerful than this being made?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I think it can be made if you can get a good quality spirit stone, but if there is such a spirit stone, it would be used to make more popular magical tools&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;A spirit stone is what was called a magic stone in my original world, is a spherical mass produced in a place called a magic reservoir. They are not ores despite the word "stone" in the name, but rather crystals of highly concentrated magical power.</p>
<p>&#12288;Almost without exception, magic stones have the property of absorbing magic power from the air. This makes them a semi-permanent source of magic power. They are indispensable in the production of magical tools.</p>
<p>&#12288;A good quality magic stone is one that absorbs magic power at a high rate. A good quality magic stone is one that has a diameter of three centimeters or more, as the magic absorption rate varies depending on its size. These magic stones are usually used for high-powered magic tools, but they are rare and precious.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I thought about it, something this man said suddenly caught my attention.</p>
<p>&#12300;Hmm? Are you the one making this magic tool?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes. I'm sorry for the delay, but my name is Robert, the owner of this store.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He was not a shopkeeper, but the owner. I thought someone else was making them, but it seems that this store was privately owned by this man.</p>
<p>&#12288;I think it's a bit cautious for a shopkeeper who can make magic tools to approach a suspicious customer he's never seen before, but this is a good chance. If I could see his memories, I should be able to figure out how to make a magic tool. I immediately performed a &lt;Memory Reading&gt; on the shopkeeper.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, I heard a cracking sound as the magics interfered with each other, and my magic was blocked. It was the first time I had ever seen such a thing in this world, but for the first time, my magic was completely blocked by a magic resistance.</p>
<p>&#12288;Not even a military magicians had been able to resist my magic, and I hadn't expected an ordinary magician to be able to prevent my magic.</p>
<p>&#12288;The shopkeeper who had been hit by my magic backed away from me and held his staff out of his pocket as if to check me. It's very easy to see that he's used to fighting from the way he moves without a moment's hesitation after blocking the magic formula.</p>
<p>&#12300;What on earth are you imitating? I've been attacked by robbers a few times when I was just starting out, but I never thought I'd be attacked by a hero. I won't forgive you, depending on how things go.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I thought he was a careless guy, but it seems that my face had been known. I didn't want to cause too much trouble, but I had no choice. I'm going to have to play hardball.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm trying to look relaxed, but I was actually quite surprised on the inside. It was my fault for being so careless, but I wouldn't normally think that anyone would be able to prevent my magic from working. It seems that this shopkeeper was quite a skilled magician.</p>
<p>&#12288;I wondered why this country had relied on outside forces first, when they could have increased the strength of the army by conscripting people like him. Does this mean that this country doesn't want its commoners to be that active?</p>
<p>&#12288;No, I don't care about that right now. I have to eliminate the threat in front of me.</p>
<p>&#12300;To be honest, I was surprised. If you're that skilled, why didn't you think of joining the army and improving your war record or studying magic further, instead of working in a magic tools store?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm better suited to making magic tools like this. The military doesn't put much stock in commoners, either. And you won't be fooled if I tell you that. You're not going to say that the magic you just did was a mistake, are you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I have no intention of making excuses. I just wanted to tell you that it's a shame that you're letting such a great ability rot away.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, if you're satisfied with that, then let's have you caught quietly. If it was outside, you would have had little chance of winning, but this is inside my store. It's not unusual for a wizard to lose in his own domain.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;......I'm glad you're so tough, but do you really think you can beat me with your level of skill? I never thought I'd hear you talk like that. In light of your bravery, I'll give you a piece of advice. If you're planning to use any kind of magic on me, you'd better not. If you think that the magic I just used is what I am capable of, let me tell you that you are mistaken.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'll prove to you that I'm not talking nonsense! &#12302;Light of Heaven, in the name of God, be a scorching spear that pierces through evil, and strike down his men!&#12303;&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As the shopkeeper held up his staff and chanted the spell, light gathered at the tip of the staff.</p>
<p>&#12288;I've always wondered why these people try to use only the chant to activate their magic. The chant is a very inefficient element to convert. If you're going to use it in a battle like this, I think a material element would be quicker to activate.</p>
<p>&#12288;Looking at his magic configuration, it seems to be a laser-based magic. How daring of him, even though we were in a store. He must be confident in his control of the magic, though, because if he's not careful, he could start a fire. I can see that he has the ability to do so. But it was a mistake to ignore my advice, wasn't it?</p>
<p>&#12300;...! Guahhh.....!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The shopkeeper suddenly begins to suffer and drops his cane. Now the shopkeeper must be experiencing unimaginable pain in his head. This is because of the Seventh Type of Telepathy Magic, &lt;Magic Stampede&gt;, which I secretly activated while the shopkeeper was having a useless conversation.</p>
<p>&#12288;This formula has the effect of replicating and forcing the target to deploy countless copies of the formula when the target tries to activate it. The reason why the shopkeeper is suffering right now is because he is being forced to deploy a magic formula that is far beyond his ability, and the load is causing tremendous pain in his brain. Since the probability of becoming a cripple is not small, it is clear that the load is still quite high.</p>
<p>&#12288;In addition, since magic power is poured evenly into all the magics, naturally there is not enough magic power to activate them. As a result, the formula that was about to be activated failed, and the magic power of the magician was uprooted and dissipated.</p>
<p>&#12288;As a result, there will be one orcerer on the verge of becoming a cripple, mentally and physically exhausted from the intense pain and depleted magic power. I warned him about it, but he didn't listen to my advice at all and activated it.</p>
<p>&#12300;Gaghh, Gguuhhhhh......!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I used &lt;Memory Reading&gt; again on the shopkeeper who was writhing around in pain. Since his magic power is gone, the magical defenses from earlier have also disappeared, so I was able to read up on how to create magical tools without any problems.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I had gathered the information I wanted, I canceled the magic formula. The pain must have receded as the outburst of the magic formula subsided, and he stood up, feeling like he was about to collapse.</p>
<p>&#12300;Do you think......you can get away with doing this for free ......? I'll tell the country about this. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Do what you want. But only if you can beat me and get out of here.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The people of this world are not cunning enough, or at least they have a strange naivete. <span style="font-style: italic;">You should have at least stood up after I left</span>. Well, I can't just let him honestly go tell them, so it doesn't matter whether he gets up or falls down.</p>
<p>&#12300;Kkuhh! You know that margin can be fatal.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's enough.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...! Gyaahhhhh!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I stunned the shopkeeper with the &lt;Fear&gt; &#160;and used the &lt;Memory Extraction&gt; to extract his memories of this place. Now that I had achieved my goal, I decided to leave quietly.</p>
<p>&#12288;Later, with the knowledge of magic tools that I had read from the shopkeeper, the example magic tool was completed without any problems. Apparently, it was not a good idea to modify it in order to manipulate the output.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;A few days later, I was told that the bath I had been waiting for was ready, so I went to see it immediately.</p>
<p>&#12288;The finished bath was about the size of a small hot spring. I have plenty of land, so this size is perfectly acceptable, but unfortunately, the floor is not sloped, so the drainage seems to be poor. Maybe I'll dig a trench.</p>
<p>&#12288;By the way, it's not outdoors. I didn't want to have to go outside every time I moved, so I forced myself to add it to the house. I could have made it an open-air bath, but I heard that the winters around here are long and the river gets so cold that it freezes over, so I decided against it.</p>
<p>&#12288;Finally, I attached some of the magical tools that I had successfully completed. The bath was now complete. When I started it up immediately, hot water came out without any problem. Now I can finally take a bath.</p>
<p>&#12288;While I was watching the hot water flowing into the bath, Elle arrived. Apparently, the sound of hot water flowing into the bath bothered her. She hadn't seen a bath before either, and was looking around inside with a curious look on her face.</p>
<p>&#12300;It's amazing, Master. Did you create a hot spring?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, this is an artificially created bath, not anything like a hot spring.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Apparently, there is a hot spring.</p>
<p>&#12300;Anyway, how do you get such a large amount of water out? Could it be that they are transferring it from the river?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I thought about that method at one time, but the purification of the water is troublesome. This is a direct purification of the water.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, I think that method would consume more magic power than the transfer and purification. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's unavoidable in order to ensure the safety of the bath. But still, there are hot springs, aren't there? So why doesn't anyone want to build a bath?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, ordinary people don't have access to magical tools that use such a large amount of water. If you sold the magic stone attached to this, an ordinary person would not only be able to live for the rest of his life, he could even start his life over again a couple of times.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;If so, then I can simply use the money from the sale of the magic stone to buy ....... No, that's not going to work, they're going to ask you where I got the magic stone .......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Next to me, Elle was reaching in and out of the hot water, wondering if she could sell the magical stone. She seemed to think that the temperature was about the same as the hot spring in her memory, and was wondering whether she should stick her hand in or not.</p>
<p>&#12288;At first, Elle was afraid to put her hand in, and was surprised to find that it wasn't as hot as she thought it would be, but after a while, she started enjoy herself as if she were playing in the river.</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, I understand that this is a bath. But what is this used for?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;After you wash your body, you soak in it to relieve your daily fatigue.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;How can you use such a large amount of water to wipe your body? I feel like it's a waste. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's not for wiping, it's for getting in.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Eh?&#12288;But if you go inside with dirt, the water will get dirty, right?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I told you to wash the body first. The water still get dirty, but that's why I keep running fresh water.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle doesn't seem to understand the idea of taking a bath very well.</p>
<p>&#12300;It can't be helped. Try it once. Then you'll understand.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I understand.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Hearing my words, she suddenly started undressing on the spot.</p>
<p>&#12300;Take your clothes off in the changing room. It was there before you came in here, wasn't it?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, I was wondering why there were so many shelves, but I guess that's where you put your clothes?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;After she undressing in the changing room, I let her take a bath again. By the way, I was outside while Elle was taking a bath. Of course, I didn't peek.</p>
<p>&#12288;A distracted voice came from inside the bath, and after a while, Elle, who had finished changing, came out.</p>
<p>&#12300;That was amazing, Master! That felt kind of good!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Right, washing myself in here would keep me cleaner than wiping myself with a cloth. Basically, I made it for me to enter, but I'm thinking of releasing it to the servants at certain times.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's a good idea. I'm sure they'll all like it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;By the way, I've already told the servants that Elle is not from the enemy country. I don't know how they feel about it in their hearts, but on the surface they seem to treat her as one of their own.</p>
<p>&#12288;The fact that the servants are not actually fighting against the Demon Empire may be a factor, but the reason they don't care about Elle more than that is because there is someone who hates more than she does. Yes, I'm talking about Lucia.</p>
<p>&#12288;Lucia was currently the most hated person in this house. She is despised by the rest of the servants because it seems that the magical markings on her face look like tattoos to other people, and also because she was originally thought to have come to work here through connections.</p>
<p>&#12288;The only ones who don't dislike her are me and Elle, who know what's going on. Tia dislikes her poor housekeeping skills, and there is no one else who will stand up for her.</p>
<p>&#12288;I guess she thought it was better than being bullied by the servants, but it's funny to see her relying on me and Elle, the cause of her dislike.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm not going to give up on her because she's so valuable to me, but I'm also not going to try to improve her situation. It's more convenient for me if she hates me.</p>
<p>&#12288;The fact that she was hired by me in the first place, I can only say that her prospects are disappointing. If she had behaved like that when we first met, she would have turned into a prostitute before long.</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, dinner is ready.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As we were talking, Lucia came to call me. She was trying to hide it with her hair, but the mark on her cheek was hard to disguise. It would be impossible for her to regain her old life.</p>
<p>&#12300;Dinner is served. Master, let's go.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, yes. I'm sorry you had to come and get me too, Lucia.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I patted her on the head, and she gave me a look that was both happy and frustrated. She hates me, but I guess she's hungry for kindness because my servants hate her. She must have been pampered by the people around her as the Duke's concubine.</p>
<p>&#12288;Well, no matter what her situation is, it doesn't matter as long as she doesn't run away from me. After all, she's the chicken that lays the golden eggs now.</p>
<p>&#12288;In addition, she is pretty as long as she stays quiet. She has the beauty to be in the Duke's concubine.I don't want to be cajoled, but I don't feel bad about being relied on.</p>
<p>&#12288;Tia is still the best, but I'm going to give Elle and Lucia preferential treatment over the others.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm sure she'll continue to do her best in this adversity, as she can't shake off my hand and remains quiet.</p>
<p>&#12288;By the way, later, when I told the other heroes that I had made a bath, Sagami said he would love to take a bath, so I invited him. It seems that there was a culture of bathing in his world too.</p>
