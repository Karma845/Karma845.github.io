<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; The Journey Is Hurried, The Trouble Is Sudden</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>8.1</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;Our departure to Leshiana was early in the morning, before the sun had even risen.</p>
<p>&#12288;There were not many people to see us off this time. It was nice to be alone with my family. The last night was more difficult than that.</p>
<p>&#12288;I was going to take Elle with me this time, but I decided to take Lucia with me just in case. She probably couldn't stand the thought of having no one on her side, so when I told her I was taking her with me, she nodded obediently.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, Tia began to object to the idea of taking Lucia with me. Apparently, she couldn't stand the idea of taking a newcomer to a place where she wasn't supposed to be. As for me, I wanted to leave Tia, whom I trusted the most, in the house where I would be away, but she didn't seem to change her opinion.</p>
<p>&#12288;In the end, I kept attacking her on the bed until she broke down, but thanks to her, I'm not sleeping well today.</p>
<p>&#12288;Unlike last time, this time there are seven members: three male heroes, Elle, Lucia, a maid who accompanies Alec, and a guide and guardian. In order to keep a low profile, we were all crammed into one carriage. Because of this, the space is quite small.</p>
<p>&#12288;I was told that I should have a knight as an escort, but I told them that if we went with too many people, we might intimidate them, and that if I took an escort who was weaker than the heroes, he would not be of much use to me, so I asked them to refrain this time.</p>
<p>&#12288;If the opponent is a magician, a large number of people will not work in your favor. If they attacked at range, the ones in the center would not be able to escape. And since most of the magicians who are capable of attacking us are capable of using ranged magic, guarding them is just a hindrance.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm also assuming that my magic won't work on them. If a large number of people go to the elves and they are hostile, there is no guarantee that I will be able to get them all out safely. If we're not prepared and we're attacked out of the blue, the most I'll be able to get away with is about 20 people.</p>
<p>&#12288;I only hope that the elves of Leshiana are not on the side of the Demon Empire.</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, the town where we are going to stay today is coming into view.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle, who was looking at the scenery ahead of us, reported this to me, but I wasn't interested, so I just waved my hand in return. The town we'll be staying in today is said to be little more than a village, so we can't expect much in the way of quality lodging.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;As I had expected, the inn was deserted, with only a poorly made bed and no services. In addition, for some reason, the window was blocked, so it was dark.</p>
<p>&#12288;I had no choice but to head into town alone to buy some alcohol or something, but for some reason the liquor stores were closed even though it was still daytime. When I looked closer, I saw that most of the other stores were closed as well.</p>
<p>&#12288;I had a hunch that something troublesome was going on. I was about to go back to the inn to stay in my room before I got involved, when an old man approached me.</p>
<p>&#12300;Traveler. That outfit, are you a wizard by any chance?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The old man seemed to have figured out that I was a magician from my outfit and spoke to me. If this is the case, I should have dressed like a commoner.</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, yes, but what do you want from me?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ooohh, I knew you are! Thank you, God, for this meeting!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I looked at the old man who looked happy at my reply and started praying to God. I sighed inwardly, thinking that it was the usual pattern again, and waited for his next words.</p>
<p>&#12288;To be honest, I wanted to leave such a person alone and run away, but I couldn't act carelessly since it was known that my face was already known to people outside the royal capital. If no one saw me, I could just erase this old man's memory, but in this situation, I don't even know where or who is watching me.</p>
<p>&#12300;Please save this town, wizard!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Let's hear what you have to say for now.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Thank you very much. This town has often been attacked by bandits before. However, until now, the bandits were a small group that could be driven back by the entire town, so even though they were attacking, they didn't cause too much damage. But recently, a new wizard joined the bandits, and their magic has become so strong that the townspeople can't defeat them.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;So it's because of them that you can't win again bandits? If that's the case, why don't you hire another magicians from outside the town?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I sent some of the town's people to the capital, but neither the knights nor the mercenaries showed up at all. Apparently, the people I sent on the errand were attacked on the way. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see, so that's why you approached me when I happened to come by. So, do you know where the bandits' base is located?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, we don't know that. All we know is that they are coming from the south. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... I'm sorry, but I'm afraid I'm taking on another job right now. I can't take on a job that I can't finish in one sitting. You'll have to look someone else.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No! Please don't say that! I'll pay you whatever you want!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The old man slammed his forehead on the ground so many times that I thought his forehead would break and asked for a favor. If I refused here, I'd be recognized as an outsider. When I checked my surroundings to be sure, I saw that there were several people looking at me. It seems that everything I said earlier had been seen. I'm not sure I can get away with this.</p>
<p>&#12300;...... old man, look up.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;W-Wizard-sama ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I can't help it if you ask me that much. I'll accept that request.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Really!? I'm glad, this town can be saved!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The people around us who were watching us were also happy to hear the old man's words. I hadn't even heard about the reward, but I felt like I couldn't say no to this unless the reward was worth it.</p>
<p>&#12288;I couldn't help but wonder if it's a curse or something that I always get caught up in this kind of commotion.</p>
<p>&#12288;By the way, as expected, I was offered an amount as low as tears. I tried to get him to raise the amount a little more, but the old man hit his forehead again and cried out, so I had to accept the amount in tears.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12300;I agree, it would be our duty to eliminate threats along the way and protect public safety. We're not that pressed for time. I think we have enough time to fulfill the old man's request.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When I returned to the inn and told Alec and the others about the matter of taking down the bandits, Sagami seemed to agree.</p>
<p>&#12300;Wait a minute, an alliance with Leshiana is an important mission for this country. I think it's wrong to compare it to this one town. We should prioritize the king's order over this town. Why did you accept such a request in the first place, Yard-dono? Isn't it possible that you're a bit loose?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Unlike Sagami, Alec seems to be against it. It seems that he's not going to help me, given that he's not happy that I've accepted it.</p>
<p>&#12288;I had no choice but to leave it to Sagami to follow him and guard Lucia, and I headed for the forest with Elle.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;It was difficult to walk in the dark and pathless forest, and it took more energy than expected, but Elle was walking as lightly as if she were walking on level ground. Once again, I was reminded that Elle was an elf.</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, I found traces of a person's passage.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I checked the place indicated by Elle who was walking in front of me, but instead of human footprints, there was nothing different from the surrounding scenery, to the point where I wanted to ask herself how on earth she knew.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I followed Elle's trail, I thought over and over again that it was the right decision to bring her along. Since a while ago, she has been detecting the presence of beasts and walking in a way that avoids dangerous places, as if she knows this forest inside and out. I wondered if this was another ability of the elves.</p>
<p>&#12288;After following Elle for a while, we came to a place that looked like a cave. A man dressed like a bandit was standing around. He seemed to be on guard duty.</p>
<p>&#12300;What should we do, Master?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;If we block the entrance, we're done, but we need to check inside to see if there are any other strongholds. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Why don't we just grab the guy at that entrance and bury the rest alive?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's radical ......, but there might be people trapped inside. I reject that idea.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was stumbling around, unable to come up with a good idea, the man on guard seemed to notice our sneaking conversation. He shouted something into the cave and then came towards us.</p>
<p>&#12300;No choice, it's a practical exercise. Elle, you take them all.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, Master.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle took her wand and began to draw a magic circle on the ground. At the same time, she released the ice statues to control them, trapping some of the first ones in the ice.</p>
<p>&#12288;When the bandits realized that they were dealing with a magician, some of them ran away and others went into the cave. Some of the bandits ran away, while others went into the cave, probably intending to call the magician.</p>
<p>&#12288;The bandits, now down to about half their number, were unafraid to charge in, but the ice in front of them prevented them from advancing as far as they wanted. In the meantime, Elle's magic circle seemed to have been completed.</p>
<p>&#12288;As soon as Elle activated her magic circle, the bandits' feet shook and a tremendous amount of water spurted up from the ground. All the bandits who were unable to move because of the shaking seemed to be hit directly, and every single one of them was blown skyward. Not a single one of them could be saved.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle invoked a Type 4 Nature Manipulation Magic, &lt;<ruby>Geyser<rt>Aquagazer</rt></ruby>&gt;. This magic, which uproots underground water veins to simulate a geyser, not only causes a large amount of water to gush out, but also causes secondary damage in the form of land subsidence.</p>
<p>&#12288;The ground shook violently, sinking rapidly from the area where the water had spouted. The entrance to the cave had not collapsed, but the inside would have partially collapsed. I told her not to collapse it, but she didn't keep her word. I don't know if the hostages would have survived that. I'll give her a lecture later.</p>
<p>&#12288;Then, with a huge amount of water, the bandits that had been sent flying fell down. They crashed into the ground and all of them were in a state of shock. I couldn't help but feel sorry for them. Not a single one of them was still breathing, but that was to be expected.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12300;Who is it!? Who's attacking my house!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;With a shout, a woman jumped out from inside. Unlike the bandits, she was wearing a triangular hat covered in dirt and a magician's robe. Perhaps that was the sorceress the old man was talking about. Seeing that her ears was slightly more elongated than a human's, it seemed she was an elf.</p>
<p>&#12300;It's you guys! How dare you do this to me? Apologies in death! &#12302;Wind, cut through&#12303;!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She noticed us and immediately activated her magic formula.</p>
<p>&#12288;Looking at the composition of the magic, it seems to be a magic that sends a blade of wind flying. It's invisible, but it's probably exactly what's flying at you. Elle hurriedly evaded, but she seemed to have completely forgotten that I was behind her, and all the bullets hit me.</p>
<p>&#65288;&#12302;First magic barrier, successfully defended. The attack magic has been successfully traced. It's assumed to be a type 1 natural manipulation system from a short distance.&#12303;)</p>
<p>&#12288;It was all neutralized by the first barrier, so I was unharmed, but I had to remind Elle to look around a little more.</p>
<p>&#12288;That magician, by the way, seems to be surprisingly talented. I've never met anyone who could use shortened chanting. It's a shame that it's not chantless, but it can't be helped because the only people I know who can do it are me and Elle.</p>
<p>&#12288;The female sorceress was surprised that I was unharmed, but her expression quickly returned to normal.</p>
<p>&#12300;You guys must be the wizards hired by the people in the northern town, right?&#12288;You know I'm Adriana, the dragon-slaying wizard, and some of you are just plain stupid.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm sorry to say that I didn't know the female sorceress who called herself Adriana at all. I've never even heard her name. Elle didn't understand her word, so she didn't respond to anything. She thought we were afraid of her because we didn't say anything, and she was smiling broadly.</p>
<p>&#12300;Um, you're the sorceress who attacked the town to the north, aren't you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Elvish ....... What are you, a dark elf? That's right, the people of that town resisted our request to give them all the gold they had. I killed a few of them in return, and they all shut up.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see. I see your point.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle activated her Ice Statue without warning, and Adriana, who was caught off guard, was unable to avoid it and took a direct hit. Her arm only froze a little, so apparently her magic resistance was high.</p>
<p>&#12300;How dare you! The match haven't started yet!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;This is not a match, but an extermination. It's worse for you to let your guard down!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;So clever! That's why the dark elves are! You don't have the guts for a fair fight, but you're always making excuses!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I never thought I'd hear that from a bandit. So, we begin now.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;!! &#12302;Wind, Crush it&#12303;!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle hits her with ice statue with a number of shots. She may have overtaken the resistance, but one of Adriana's arms is frozen and useless.</p>
<p>&#12288;But Adriana didn't just take it quietly either. A gust of wind came from right above Elle, and she was knocked to the ground. Apparently, the strength of the magic was superior to that of her opponent. She looked no more than twenty years old, but she must have accumulated quite a bit of training.</p>
<p>&#12288;As she hurriedly tried to stand up, Elle was hit by a wind blade, probably in pursuit. Maybe because she couldn't see it. As she rolled on the ground in an impossible position to avoid it, the ground Elle was on exploded. How could she have known that such an attack was coming?</p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zxMMFqk.jpg"></img>

			<p>&#12300;&#12302;Wind, cut through&#12303;! C'mon, c'mon! What's the matter!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Kuhh! You're just a Wild Elf!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It seems that Adriana is a Wild Elf or something like that. I know why her looks don't match her abilities. The name suggests that she is an elf who lives in the wilderness. But we're in the forest, right?</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was thinking about such trivial things, before I knew it, Adriana had stopped moving. Thorny thorns made of ice were wrapped around her feet. Apparently, Elle had frozen her feet with the ice-bound thorns. They crawled up her body faster and faster, and in no time it was at her waist.</p>
<p>&#12288;Adriana is pulling to pull her leg out, but it's not a magic that can be pulled off like that. Elle, too, has finally stopped the wind blade and is standing up, brushing the dirt from her clothes.</p>
<p>&#12300;This is why I hate dark elves, for them always use some nasty tricks up your sleeve.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't want to hear it from you, who simply blasts me with the wind!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Adriana's body froze, leaving her head, and she glared at Elle in frustration.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle is giving her opponent a lot of room to maneuver since she has blocked her movement. However, Elle still has a lot of work to do. In a magician's battle, just sealing the body is not enough to feel safe at all. That'll be another sermon later.</p>
<p>&#12288;As expected, Adriana had created one trap, but Elle hadn't noticed. By the looks of it, it's a direct hit.</p>
<p>&#12300;You fool, I've got you! &#12302;Wind of Valor, bring them to justice&#12303;!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Seeing Elle approaching, Adriana's frustrated expression changed to a grin, and she activated the magic circle carved into the ground with her wind blade.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle hurriedly tried to avoid it, but it was a little too late. She was caught up in the tornado that erupted from beneath her feet and quickly disappeared. Perhaps a blade of wind was cutting her up inside.</p>
<p>&#12288;A few moments later, the tornado dissipated, and there was Elle, her whole body torn to shreds and bleeding profusely.</p>
<p>&#12300;I-I'm sorry. ......mas......ter......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle looked at me with all her strength and muttered, and fell to the ground. The amount of blood that flowed out clearly indicated that her life was over.</p>
<p>&#12300;You fool, you're a dark elf, and you're going to pay for challenging me. Now, it's your turn.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Adriana took a glance at Elle and turned to me. She has a relaxed expression on her face, as if she thinks I'm slowing Elle down because I didn't join her earlier. Apparently, she's forgotten about the fact that I disabled her magic just now.</p>
<p>&#12300;Adriana, you say? It's fine to show off your leeway, but I don't want you to get carried away just because you killed my apprentice.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Huh! You were her master!? So it's your fault that she's weak!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's true that she was still in training, and her lack of practice was holding her back.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You think you can beat me? Don't be a fool! &#12302;Wind, cut through!&#12303;&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She sent a blade of wind at me. I know something is hitting the barrier because I get a warning, but I still can't see the wind. The problem is that she's only using the voice element, but that magic is surprisingly useful.</p>
<p>&#12300;Tsk! Apparently it's true that you're stronger than that her. Then how about this! &#12302;Wind, Crush it&#12303;!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The grass around my feet was blown away all at once, with me in the center. But seeing that the important thing is that I'm not moving at all, Adriana looks as if she's biting down on a bitter bug.</p>
<p>&#12288;She've unleashed a number of attacks, but they've all been nullified by my barriers. I've been holding back my attacks since earlier so that she can fire off a big shot, but she hasn't used the same magic that she unleashed on Elle.</p>
<p>&#12288;I was expecting a little more variety in her magics, but apparently she can't use too many of them. I think it's my turn now.</p>
<p>&#12300;It looks like you haven't moved since a while ago, but all you can do is protect yourself!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What, can I move now?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It was a little earlier than I expected, but no problem. So let's attack her too.</p>
<p>&#12288;I quickly drew a magic circle on the ground and activated it immediately. Without even giving Adriana a chance to brace herself for my magic, the fourth type of spirit-sensitive magic, the &lt;Astral Shift&gt;, was activated.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>8.2</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;She and I were transported into a space that was all white. There was nothing else, only me and Adriana existing in this place.</p>
<p>&#12300;Is this ......? What the hell did you do!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;This is a world that is slightly out of phase with the original world. I call it the spirit world. The body is left in the original world, and only the spirit and magic are brought here. There is no physical death here, but there is a spiritual death. So if you die here, you'll be a cripple in the original world.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's nonsense, spatial leaping should have been proven impossible even if it was limited to the mental body!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't need your common sense to tell me what to do. But since it's actually possible, I think you need to face reality a little bit. You can use the same magics here as in the original world, so don't worry about that.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;!! You're making a fool me! &#12302;Wind, cut through it&#12303;!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Wind blades flew at me, but since the magic barrier was the same as in the original world, I nullified all of them without any problem. I'm sure she's beginning to see the difference in our abilities, but she's dripping with sweat and glaring at me with a serious expression.</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't be so rude. I like you rather a lot. I'm going to let you try a few things, but if you win all of them, I'll let you out of here and I promise not to attack you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Is that true?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, it's a promise a magician makes. You know that, don't you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;All right. So, what are the rules?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Since she took my suggestion, I first heal her with an &lt;Major Heal&gt;. She was wondering what I was going to do, but she responded honestly to the recovery.</p>
<p>&#12288;I did this because I don't enjoy it much when she is in a bad condition. There's no fun in defeating a weakened opponent.</p>
<p>&#12300;Now, what I'm going to ask you to do is simple. Defeat all the demons I summon. I'll summon them twice in total, but I'll also heal you between the first and second summonings. The only condition for defeat is that you die.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Fine. Let's get started.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Now that she seems to be ready, I'll use a magic that is limited to the spiritual world. The Eighth Type of Material Creation Magic, &lt;Astral Summon&gt;. With its activation, more than a dozen black wolves appear.</p>
<p>&#12288;She can't hide her surprise at the summoning of the black wolves. Normally, summoning requires a contract to be signed with the target of the summoning, but this magic is not called summoning at all, but rather a magic to create rather than summon, so there is no problem.</p>
<p>&#12288;The moment it was summoned, she immediately reacted to the black wolves that jumped towards Adriana and sent it wind blades flying.</p>
<p>&#12288;If you are an ordinary magician, even one of them should be a difficult enemy, but even against a dozen of them, she has not backed down. The dragon slayers are the real deal.</p>
<p>&#12288;While applying the wind blade to the black wolves that attacked from all sides, when in danger, she would blow up a gust of wind around herself, allowing the black wolves to approach only rarely.</p>
<p>&#12288;She took them down one by one with precision, and finally the last one was defeated. She seemed to have used a good amount of magic and physical strength, so I used Restoration to fully recover her lost magic and physical strength. Seeing that my magic power has hardly decreased at all, it seems that her magic power is not too bad either.</p>
<p>&#12300;I guess you're cleared the first part. Should I congratulate you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Enough with the talk, let's get the next one out of here!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't panic, I'll give you your favorite dragon for the next.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hah, dragons for me. I don't care how many come, they're no better than the black wolf from earlier! I think you know I'm going to win, don't you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's a lot of confidence. Then let's see what you can do.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I draw a magic circle almost identical to the one I just used, and activate it. The &lt;Astral Summon&gt; is activated, and two dragons appear. Both of them are identical, but when Adriana saw them, her expression tightened with fear.</p>
<p>&#12288;The dragon I brought out is the "Red Scale" I've seen before. I've heard that one of these dragons is different from the others, but two of them. It was no wonder that her expression was drawn out.</p>
<p>&#12288;The two dragons, like the black wolf, attacked her from the moment they appeared. She hurriedly fought back with her wind blades, but even though they could cut through the scales of ordinary dragons, they could not cut through the scales of the Red Scales.</p>
<p>&#12288;Two of them were spitting flames at her and attacking her with their claws and tails, trying to tear her apart and knock her down, and she could only avoid them desperately in vain.</p>
<p>&#12300;This is impossible! No matter how much I try, I can't win against two "Red Scales"! I admit defeat, so please forgive me!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You can't be so pathetic. The hero defeated this guy with one blow. If you try a little harder, you might be able to give them a scratch or two.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Please, I'll do anything. Please forgive me!I'm really going to die if it continue like this!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't talk too lightly about a magician will do anything. I'm telling you to fight these guys to the death.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Damn you, you demon! You're dead!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Adriana dexterously flies at me while avoiding the attacks of the two dragons.</p>
<p>&#12288;Do you really think that I, who created these two dragons, am weaker than them? All of her attacks are nullified, and she can't even give me a scratch.</p>
<p>&#12288;The situation was so desperate that her face was a mess of various fluids.</p>
<p>&#12288;If I hadn't been so vain, I would have just taken one of them, but after hearing her talk like that, I couldn't help but take two. It was her own fault.</p>
<p>&#12288;I was expecting her to try a little harder, given her strong attitude at first.</p>
<p>&#12288;I was instantly turned off by her attitude, crying and screaming like a child. Enough is enough.</p>
<p>&#12300;......! Cra-!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;After a reasonably long fight, she loosened up for a moment. The two dragons could not miss that, and her body was torn apart and scattered by their claws. Her original world body didn't die, but her spirit disappeared and she became a cripple.</p>
<p>&#12288;Even she, who seemed to be the strongest person I had ever met in this world, was no match for the two "Red Scales". It seems that the inhabitants of this world are still weak. I'm going to try to get Elle to be able to kill these guys instantly.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;With victory or defeat decided, I canceled the &lt;Astral Shift&gt; and returned to my original world. There, the traces of the battle from earlier are still there, and Elle's body is still intact.</p>
<p>&#12288;I approach Elle and activate &lt;Resurrection&gt;. Apparently her head had been properly protected, and she got up, moaning.</p>
<p>&#12300;..........I'm sorry, Master.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, I'll lecture you later. Be prepared for it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She seemed to be okay, so I headed over to Adriana, who was drooling with a dumbfounded expression on her face. Elves are generally more beautiful than humans, but when they look like this, it's quite a shame because she was originally beautiful.</p>
<p>&#12288;I waved my hand in front of her, but she still didn't respond. Unfortunately, it seems that she has become a complete cripple. I guess this is the end of the bandits here. I used the &lt;Memory Extraction&gt; to see if there were any other bandits, but it seems that this was all of them.</p>
<p>&#12288;In order to bring her back as proof of my defeat, I activate the 7th type of Telepathy, Artificial Personality, and implant a pseudo-personality in her. She can only respond almost mechanically, but it's better than being a cripple.</p>
<p>&#12300;Now, can you hear what I'm saying?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, sir.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What's your name?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Name has not been set yet. Set it up, please.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Adriana. Your name is Adriana.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Adriana, I memorized it. My name is Adriana.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It's a hassle, because it's usually like this. I leave Adriana to Elle, and I decide to check out the cave.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;Inside the cave, the ceiling and floor were crumbling all over the place, rattled by the magic Elle had activated. According to her memory, there were some people who had been captured, so I headed in that direction.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I arrived at the jail-like place, I found a group of naked humans in chains and an elf passed out. The humans were mostly women, and there was only one man. Their bodies showed signs of having been assaulted. The men must have been killed or sold.</p>
<p>&#12288;I noticed that I hit the only man. At first, he glared at me, but the moment I told him I was here to help, his attitude changed dramatically.</p>
<p>&#12300;You've come to save us! Thank you!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;The women are in a terrible state, but you're safe, aren't you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, I'm not. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When I saw the man holding his back with his chained hands, I realized what he meant. Let's not bring up this topic any further.</p>
<p>&#12288;I removed the chains with the key I found outside the room, and the man was able to move freely and stretch his body for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p>&#12300;Okay, you can help me remove the chains too.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, sir!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I also remove the chains on the women. They didn't wake up for a while, but I guess that means they weren't as sturdy as this guy.</p>
<p>&#12288;I could hear some of them moaning as they regained consciousness, and as I approached to explain the situation, some of the women jumped on me. Some of them were trying to get their hands on me to take off my clothes, while others couldn't resist and were trying to lick my clothes off.</p>
<p>&#12300;Mess of my pussy!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No! I'm going to make you cum first!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Mmmm... ...... Please hurry up and let me clean up Master Penis. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The girls seem to have already lost their minds. I forcefully pull them away from me. When I looked next to me, I saw that the guy had gone through the same thing, but he was playing with the women who were attacking him with a happy expression on his face.</p>
<p>&#12288;I looked around to see if there were any women who were still sane, but it seemed that all but the elves were dead. Even the elves looked lifeless, probably dazed from the narcotic poison.</p>
<p>&#12288;It would be impossible to make them lose their senses to this extent without using a very strong drug.</p>
<p>&#12288;Unfortunately, I only have enough antidote for one person, so I can't cure all of them. In the meantime, I used the &lt;Neutralize Poison)&gt; on the only elf I could talk to.</p>
<p>&#12288;The effect of the formula made the drug's ingredients disappear, and she regained her senses. The semen stuck here and there speaks eloquently of what was done to her here, but it's admirable that she doesn't even scream.</p>
<p>&#12288;She stands up on wobbly legs, though she hasn't regained her strength, and stands back, wary of me. Her face, staring at me with strong-willed blue eyes, is stained with semen, but I can see her original beauty at a glance.</p>
<p>&#12288;The fact that she hasn't lost her will to resist even though she's been raped to this extent shows the strength of the elf's mind.</p>
<p>&#12288;It must have felt so good to bring her to her knees. I don't think I'd feel that way if I was covered in semen.</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't worry. I've defeated all the bandits here. I am here who came to save you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You're human, but you can speak elvish. ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't speak Elvish, but you can expect me to understand Elvish.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Is that some kind of magic? How convenient. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Now that she understands my language, she speaks to me with caution. Apparently, she doesn't speak much of the kingdom language. That means she might be an elf from Leshiana.</p>
<p>&#12288;After letting the semen on her body drain away, she began to unravel her body, which had hardened due to her captivity.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I faced her, I could see that she had a nice figure, but she didn't seem to mind.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle is also wearing revealing clothes, and I wonder if it's the nature of elves that they don't show any shame.</p>
<p>&#12300;I didn't expect to be rescued by a human, but...... I'm&nbsp;grateful.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't worry about it, it was just a coincidence that I helped you. Are you the elves of Leshiana?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, my husband was supposed to be there. Do you know where he is?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;There were other elves? Unfortunately, there are no other captives in this cave.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;According to Adriana's memory, all the elves except her had been sold off or killed. If there were any possessions left of those who were sold, there would still be a way to find them, but with nothing, there was nothing we could do.</p>
<p>&#12288;She was trying to act tough, but if you looked closely, I could see her shoulders shaking. She didn't know what had happened to her husband after her tragedy. It must be very frustrating for her, but it would be wrong to offer words of comfort to her as she tries to bear her grief.</p>
<p>&#12300;At any rate, I want to get out of here as soon as possible. If you can't go home alone, I'll take you back to Leshiana, what do you say?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Why are you being so accommodating to me?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm just asking because I was originally planning to go to Leshiana, and I was wondering if you'd like to join me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Well, if you don't mind, I want you to take me with you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She seemed to have a lot on her mind, but decided that it would be dangerous to return alone. She was afraid to go back to the forest alone because she had been captured by bandits. Her words were strong, but her expression showed that she was relieved.</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, then, it's a pleasure to meet you for a short time. My name is Yard Al Werner.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm Natalia. Nice to meet you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Come to think of it, I've heard that the elves of Leshiana are hate humans very much misanthropes, but Natalia's reaction doesn't seem to be that she hates humans. I wonder if she is different.</p>
<p>&#12288;I handed her the robe I was wearing, kicked the man who was still being raped to the ground, and led the women out. Adriana seemed to have finished setting things up, and she and Elle were waiting for me to come out.</p>
<p>&#12300;! This guy is still here!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As soon as Natalia saw Adriana's figure, she moved away from us and took a fighting stance. By the way, I forgot to explain to her.</p>
<p>&#12300;There's no need to be so cautious. Adriana there has become a cripple. Right now, she's just a temporary persona in her body that I'm manipulating.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;! You've defeated that Adriana? I thought you had come here to help us, but I had no idea that you had defeated her. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You Wood Elf, comparing my master to a small fish like this is beyond rude.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Elle, don't get into a fight. They've just been saved and they're exhausted.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I understand, Master.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Natalia looks at me with a surprised expression when she sees Elle's attitude. I see, she's surprised that a dark elf is treating a human as a master.</p>
<p>&#12288;I turned around to see if the others were okay, but the man seemed to be too busy being embraced by the women to do anything about it. He was at the mercy of the women, his face contorted in a disheveled manner. He didn't seem to be paying much attention to us.</p>
<p>&#12288;I was a little annoyed by the situation, so I kicked his butt. When I saw him holding his buttocks in agony, I felt a sense of relief.</p>
<p>&#12288;Now, it is quite dangerous to walk through the forest with this many people, so I'll just use a straightforward magic here. Since Natalia was the only one who seemed to be a sorceress, I could cheat as much as I wanted.</p>
<p>&#12288;I drew a magic circle on the ground, put everyone inside the magic circle, and activated it. Due to the effect of the &lt;<ruby>Advanced Mass Transfer<rt>Greater Mass Teleportation</rt></ruby>&gt;, we arrived at the town in an instant.</p>
<p>&#12288;The others seemed to be surprised by this and were looking around in awe. I could see the people of the town rushing towards us when they realized we were back. Apparently, one of them knew one of us.</p>
<p>&#12288;I left Natalia to Elle and asked her to go to the inn first. I guess we can handle one more guest.</p>
<p>&#12288;I took Adriana to look for the old man, who was apparently the mayor of this town. I had a hunch that he was, but in return for going to the trouble of asking me to do such a theatrical thing, He must gave me an extra amount of reward.</p>
<p>&#12288;Currently, Adriana is tied hand and foot in the middle of the town. What is about to take place is a private execution. The families of the people killed by her and the bandits are gathering around and throwing stones at her. She can't avoid them, and she's bleeding from the stones hitting her in various places.</p>
<p>&#12288;Most of the people throwing stones at her are children and old people whose families have been killed, mostly women. The men were glaring at her hatefully, but besides the ones throwing stones at her, there were others who were looking at her with an ulterior motive.</p>
<p>&#12288;From the looks of it, she's going to be raped by the men after this. She is also an elf, so she has a much more beautiful face than a normal human woman, and she has a glamorous body that doesn't match the rather slender elf, so I do understand how the men feel.</p>
<p>&#12288;In the end, I didn't even want to see what people were doing, so I left the mayor in charge of the other people I brought back, and I left as quickly as I could.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;It was almost night when I got back to the inn. I was already feeling sleepy, so after eating dinner, I went back to my room and collapsed into bed.</p>
<p>&#12288;But just as I was about to fall asleep, there was an unexpected knock on the door of my room. I opened the door, wondering who was disturbing someone who was trying to sleep, and found Natalia there.</p>
<p>&#12288;She had a troubled expression on her face. She was looking away from my face, but she occasionally glanced at my expression.</p>
<p>&#12300;What do you want?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;.........I'm sorry for waking you up when you were asleep, but I have a favor to ask you. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hmm? If it's just a quick errand, I'm happy to listen. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Before I could finish my sentence, she hugged me. She was breathing hot air as she rubbed herself against me. The way she rubs against me with flushed cheeks, it looks like she's in heat.</p>
<p>&#12288;I had completely removed the drug from her system earlier, so it must be the habit of the elf in heat. When I looked at her with a dumbfounded look, thinking that I had seen this situation before, she noticed my gaze and looked back at me with a passionate gaze.</p>
<p>&#12300;What I'm asking is for you to hold me. Please, my body is aching. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, but I'm pretty tired today. I'm going to have to ask you to leave for the day.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I pull her off and close the door and lock it. She's still talking to me outside, but I'm too sleep-deprived to deal with her.</p>
<p>&#12288;I had completely forgotten about the elves' infatuation with the strong opposite sex, but I had no idea that Natalia, who was supposed to have a husband, would be infatuated as well. I'm sure there are many adulterers out there, but don't they ever feel a little bad for their husbands?</p>
<p>&#12288;After a while, Elle, who had come to pick up Natalia, started arguing with her. I put up a soundproof barrier to keep out the noise, and when it became quiet, I went to sleep.</p>
<p>&#12288;The next morning, I went to check on Adriana before I left and found her dead, her body stained with blood and semen.</p>
<p>&#12288;She probably should have joined the army as a sorceress instead of a bandit, but this was the result of her getting carried away by doing something that people would hate her for. She looked so miserable, but I didn't feel sorry for her because she deserved everything she got.</p>
