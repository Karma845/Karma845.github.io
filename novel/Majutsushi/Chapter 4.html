<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Desperation, Hope of the Heroes</h3>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>4.1</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;The memories I had taken from Elmaire contained information on the deployment of the forces of the Demon Empire. After the first assault, we were able to avoid the enemy's path, so we were able to reach the fortress on the fourth day as planned.</p>
<p>&#12288;The long-awaited relief supplies arrived, and the atmosphere in the fortress, which was still in a state of battle, was inappropriately cheerful. I'm sure there is some hope that the arrival of the heroes will help to break this situation.</p>
<p>&#12300;Now then, Heroes, it is fortunate that you have been able to arrive here safely. The only thing left to do is to endure until the Demon Empire retreats, but let's not lose heart and do our best. However, I'm sure you're all tired from the long journey and escort, so please take today off to rest.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I heard that the soldiers would take care of the work today, so I decided to take them at their word.</p>
<p>&#12288;The room I was shown was supposed to be for two people, but it was much smaller than the one in the castle, reminding me of my old laboratory. I felt strangely calm, probably because I have a feeling of being a recluse.</p>
<p>&#12300;Um, is it really okay for me to stay here?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Sure, no problem.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Elmaire, my roommate, asks me with some trepidation, and I reply. It was my wish to put her in this room in the first place.</p>
<p>&#12288;At first, the two women objected, but after I convinced them that I was teaching her the secrets of magic and that I couldn't allow outsiders to see inside, they reluctantly relented.</p>
<p>&#12288;There is no such thing as a secret, but there is no doubt that there are certain magics that are troublesome if seen by other people. Besides, it seems that people in this world think it's forbidden to play around with their bodies.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm thinking of teaching her my magic magics, and eventually have her work on my behalf.</p>
<p>&#12288;Since I came to this world, I've behaved rather freely, but I think it's best not to act in a conspicuous manner any more. If you stand out too much, you are more likely to get into trouble.</p>
<p>&#12288;If I can make people think that other heroes are more capable, there will be less chance that I will be targeted as an important person.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, if I had to make a move, it would be better to have someone who could take my place. That's where I'll use her.</p>
<p>&#12288;Well, since I will be suspected if I don't have some ability, I will ask her to have a higher ability than the standard of this world.</p>
<p>&#12300;First of all, you are not to tell anyone what was done in this room. Do you understand?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, I understand. I will never tell anyone.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;All right, well, I've got a few things to do, so you wait in this room.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It must be hard for her right now to be left behind in a strange place, but I told her not to worry because I'll be back soon.</p>
<p>&#12288;I left my room and headed for Sagami's place. This seemed to be a single room. When I entered the room, my eyes met with Sagami's, who was doing muscle training. It was his day off, but he was working hard.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sagami-dono, can I have a word with you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Sure, it's fine. Come on in.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I sat down in the only chair available and he sat down on the bed. I can't wait to get out of here, like two guys in a small room that's hot and stuffy from all the muscle training he has been doing.</p>
<p>&#12300;Let me get straight to the point: you need to teach that princess the importance of information, like espionage.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;May I ask why?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;In a kingdom that is outnumbered in terms of sheer quantity, you know that technology and information are more important than in a normal country. The surprise attack the other day was proof that the military here had no idea of the other side's movements. If we don't take action during the winter at the latest, there won't be much left of this country after the winter is over.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, that's a very real possibility.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Like the princess, this country must have taken only ad hoc measures. The fact that they called us in when they were cornered is a good example. But in a war, it becomes difficult to win if you don't know what the other side is doing and take the initiative before the enemy does. And yet, this country lacks the resources to make such a decision.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I am of the same opinion. I was planning to advise the princess before the next meeting. But I didn't expect Yard-dono to visit me. What is your reason for wanting me to tell her?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;This is a very personal matter, but she doesn't like me. I thought she would be more receptive if you told her than if I told her.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... I see, I understand. I'll let her know.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, please take care of it. Please don't mention me, okay? I don't want her to get upset. I'll leave you to it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;After finishing my business, I hurriedly left the Sagami room. It was cool outside the room, probably because it was getting close to winter. I decided to go back to my room as soon as possible to put Elmaire at ease.</p>
<p>&#12288;Once back in my room, I took Elmaïre out and we had dinner together in the dining room.</p>
<p>&#12288;Even though Margarete had told the soldiers, there were still a few soldiers who glared at her, as if they hated people from the enemy country.</p>
<p>&#12288;Even though she didn't understand the words, she seemed to sense that she was not welcomed, and she clung to my arm.</p>
<p>&#12288;I felt bad for Elmaire, but I enjoyed the feel of her breasts against my arm as I walked back to my room.</p>
<p>&#8251;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well then, Elmaire. I am now going to teach you a magic.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama, you can call me Elle. I have a feeling that's how I was called before.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see, then I guess ...... Well, you can call me Teacher or Master.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Sure, Master. Please take care of me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I stopped her from sitting upright on the floor and made her sit on the bed. It's hard for me to do this because she still have some of the strange manners she learned in the Demon Empire, but I'm sure she'll forget them soon enough.</p>
<p>&#12300;You'll have to understand the Type 4 of magic, which is the magic circle technique. In the first place, a magic circle is used to activate a magic formula that has a huge amount of information that is too large to be expressed by movement or sound. If you master this, you can use a strategic level magic formula that can even destroy this world.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Uhh, Master, I don't really understand what you're saying.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Fumu. Listen, if you learn the magic circle, you will be able to use great magic.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, I understand.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'll show you the Type 4 of magic first. Follow me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I took Elle with me and went outdoors. It was already dark outside, and it was hard to see the scenery in the distance. This should be fine.</p>
<p>&#12300;They say elves can see at night. Can you see those mountains in the distance?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, it's a little dark, but I can see it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Okay, keep your eyes on it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;With a nearby branch, I drew a magic circle on the ground. It took me about ten minutes to complete the magic circle, which was about five meters in diameter, and I immediately activated it.</p>
<p>&#12288;When the magic is activated, the area around the middle of the mountain that I had just shown disappears.</p>
<p>&#12288;This is the effect of the Type 4 Tactical Class Magic, Gravity Sphere. It's a rough magic that creates a very small black hole at the target point.</p>
<p>&#12288;Surprised by the sudden disappearance of the mountain, Elle looks back and forth between me and the mountain. It's worth teaching when there's some kind of reaction like this.</p>
<p>&#12300;M-Master! The mountain has disappeared!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, it did. Now that's a Type 4 Tactical Class Magic called Gravity Sphere. You can't select the target within the range, so it's not easy to use, but it's a very powerful magic.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;The mountain disappeared, is that the most powerful magic out there ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;This is what it means to use a magic circle. The rest of the time, keep this magic a secret, too.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I-I understand!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Now you understand the strength of the magic circle. All that's left to do is to teach her properly.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle looked at the destruction caused by the magic formula and was excited like a child, though she kept her voice quiet. I know it will be a long time before she is able to use that magic, but I need her to be able to do it someday.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, today was the first time she saw a Tactical Class, and at this level, no one would notice, so I'll tolerate it.</p>
<p>&#8251;</p>
<p>&#12288;After demonstrating the magic and teaching her some basic knowledge, I felt sleepy, so I decided to call it a day and go to sleep.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was lazing in bed, I felt the weight of someone stretching over my body, and I jumped up quickly.</p>
<p>&#12288;It was not an assassin, but Elle. She was wearing nothing but her panties, and her breasts were fully exposed.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle moistens her lips with her tongue and gazes at me with her naked body unsparingly exposed, her eyes glowing red in the darkness, creating a bewitching atmosphere that doesn't match her still young appearance.<br /></p>

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/60TL5Kt.jpg"></img>

			<p>&#12300;Elmaire, what the hell are you doing ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, Master. You're awake?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When she realized that I was awake, she brought her face to me. I don't know if it's my imagination, but her face is blushing and she's breathing hard. Is this a sign that she's in heat?</p>
<p>&#12300;Master. You're training a lot, aren't you ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She looks enraptured as she strokes my body, and no matter how you look at it, she's not in a proper state of mind. However, she didn't seem to be in heat before she went to bed. I have absolutely no idea what caused it.</p>
<p>&#12288;I sent a telepathic message to Margarete to see if she might know why she was like this, but she didn't respond. She didn't seem to be asleep, but she might be concentrating on something else.</p>
<p>&#12288;I had no choice but to send a telepathic to Tia, and it connected to her.</p>
<p>(Tia, I'd like to ask you a few questions, but is this fine now?)</p>
<p>(This voice, is that you Master? It's all right here. What kind of question is it?)</p>
<p>&#12288;At any rate, I told her about how I made Elle my apprentice, told her about her behavior until just now, and asked her if she had any idea why she was in heat. During this time, Elle is still rubbing her face against my chest.</p>
<p>(Probably because she saw her master's magic. Originally, elves are much longer-lived than humans and are not very active in breeding. Instead, when they see a human who is stronger than they are, their bodies go into heat on their own in order to leave offspring.)</p>
<p>(Is that right? ...... No, I get it. I'm sorry to bother you at this hour.)</p>
<p>(No, please feel free contact me anytime. I'll be waiting for you.)</p>
<p>&#12288;I released the telephatic and looked at Elle. It must have been hard being in the army if you rutted for the strong ones. Or was she a pretty good sorceress that she wouldn't go into heat for another man?</p>
<p>&#12288;Her body was hot and fiery with rutting, and I could feel her nipples hardening as she held me close to her. I could also feel her soft breasts, though they were small compared to Tia and Sophie's.</p>
<p>&#12288;Normally, I would have been happy to embrace her without holding back if she had pressed me this hard.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, she was currently my apprentice and experimental subject. I don't have the option of embracing her, because it would be troublesome if I were to develop unnecessary feelings for her.</p>
<p>&#12288;What's more, I don't like to be attacked. It suits me better to attack than to be attacked by a woman. It's hard to feel good when Elle is doing whatever she wants.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I pull her off and hold her down, she doesn't seem to understand why I'm resisting and looks at me with anxious eyes.</p>
<p>&#12300;Right now, you're just reacting to your body. Don't do anything you'll regret later.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Eh, no way, I really like Master.....&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;If that's the case, then I'm sorry to say that the relationship between you and me right now is no more than that of master and disciple. I don't love you enough to have a relationship with you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I was really just keeping her as an apprentice, and I wasn't particularly interested in a physical relationship with her. I don't have any sexual desire for experimental subjects, and if I were to fuck her here, the women would think I was taking advantage of her weakness and hang me up. I didn't want that kind of trouble.</p>
<p>&#12288;She realized that I had rejected her and clutched at my feet, her face turning pale.</p>
<p>&#12300;You're wrong! I just want to be with you, Master! I don't need you to love me! Master!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Calm down, I know how you feel. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As if to interrupt my attempts to calm her down, the door suddenly slams.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, sir! Her Highness, the Second Princess, wants to see you! She says it's urgent, so please get ready!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I don't know if the timing is good or bad, but an urgent call at this time of the day, could it be that the Demon Empire has attacked? Anyway, I hurriedly put on my jacket and was about to leave when Elle clung to me.</p>
<p>&#12300;Please! Please don't abandon me, Master!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;All right, don't worry. You're my disciple, and I'm not going to abandon you for something like this. I'm not going to punish you for what you just did. I'll just consider it as an act of anxiety due to lack of memory. You should forget about it and go to bed.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't want to! Please take me with you! I won't do this to you again!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't be absurd. Even with Margarete's permission, your position is still very delicate right now. I'll be right back. Just wait in your room quietly.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;No matter what I said, she wouldn't leave, so I asked the soldier who had come to call for me to help, and forcibly pulled her off. The soldier held her in place and I ran to the room I wanted.</p>
<p>&#12288;Behind me, Elle continues to scream. The fact that she is so obsessed with me must be a result of her memory loss. I don't regret what I've done, but I have to be very careful not to do this again.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;When I entered the room, there were two men besides the other heroes and Margarete. I think they called themselves the second-in-command and the chief of staff or something.</p>
<p>&#12288;She took a sideways glance at me, who was late, and frowned for a moment, but quickly returned to her normal expression again.</p>
<p>&#12300;Has everyone gathered? Then let's start the meeting right away.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I took my seat, Margarete started to speak. She seemed to have a nervous look on her face. It can't be that the Demon Empire has already attacked us, can it? While the others are in a serious mood, I'm running and drinking water because I'm thirsty.</p>
<p>&#12300;What happened?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Right, actually, this evening, the watchtower to the north was attacked in an unknown detail and the whole mountain was wiped out, in the vicinity. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;<span style="font-style: italic;">*splurt!*</span>&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... What are you doing? Don't interrupt me!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;M-My apologies, I'm just choked up. Please continue&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Oh no, that's me. I had no idea there was a watchtower over there.</p>
<p>&#12288;I gushed out the water I had been drinking at the mention of it, and Fairis, who was standing next to me, glared at me with a fierce look. As I apologized to her for removing my wet veil, my mind was occupied with how to get out of this situation.</p>
<p>&#12300;...... continue. There was not even any wreckage left in the vicinity, and it looked as if the entire ground had been gouged out by something. I believe this to be an attack by the enemy's new magic.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Damn it! A new large-scale magic at a time like this!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I've never heard of a spell that can blow up a mountain. So the enemy had such a terrible trump card in addition to using demons. ...... What can we do about it?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Everyone but me is discussing this magic thing. Shall I be honest? No, that would show off the strength of my magic. More importantly, it's not good that I blew up the watchtower and caused damage to our allies. No matter what painful excuse I have, I have to cover it up somehow.</p>
<p>&#12300;Ah, can I have a moment?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What can I do for you, Yard-sama?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Actually, I have an idea about that phenomenon, but ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I can see that everyone's eyes turned to me when they heard my words. Okay, I've thought of a good excuse. All I have to do now is keep an open mind so as not to arouse suspicion.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama, is that true?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, actually, I felt a certain presence earlier and happened to be checking the location of the attack with my magic. That's one of the reasons for my lateness, but it wasn't an enemy attack in the first place.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I-Is that true!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, the principle is difficult to explain, so I'll skip it, but it's just a natural phenomenon. It's also extremely rare one that we may or may not see even if we live for billions of years. Besides, I know how to deal with this phenomenon, so it won't cause any damage to this place.&#12301;<br /></p>
<p>&#12288;It was a fishy explanation, but everyone seemed to believe me when they saw me explaining it without hesitation. I can see that the tension I felt earlier has loosened up a bit.</p>
<p>&#12300;What kind of phenomenon was that, Hero-sama?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Perhaps you have heard of a phenomenon called a black hole. It is a singularity that sucks in everything on a very small scale. Normally, this wouldn't happen, but the twisting of space causes a similar phenomenon to occur. The reason for this is probably that we heroes, who do not exist in this world, approached this area where there is an excessive amount of magic power for some reason.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Then won't the same thing happen again?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Later, I will give you a magic tool that will cure the distorted space. The probability of the phenomenon happening again without doing anything is close to zero, but as long as you wear it, it will never happen again.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see, well, if Yard-dono, who is an expert in magic, says so much, then it should be fine. But it was a black hole. ...... I had no idea that such a phenomenon was occurring. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It seems that he knew about it. The others seemed to trust my story completely when they found out that Sagami also knew about the phenomenon. I managed to fool them.</p>
<p>&#12288;After deciding to tell the soldiers what had happened tomorrow morning so as not to upset them unnecessarily, the meeting was soon over.</p>
<p>&#12288;I hurried back to my room and Elle hugged me the moment I opened the door. She just wouldn't leave me, so I had no choice but to sleep in the same bed today. I hope she'll be back to normal by tomorrow.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>4.2</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;Two weeks had already passed since we arrived at the fortress.</p>
<p>&#12288;The demon empire continued to make a various attacks, but the defenses of the fortress, which had received support supplies, were not fazed by such attacks.</p>
<p>&#12288;This is the reason why there has been no enemy strong enough for the heroes to go out to battle, but for the past two weeks, we heroes have not been idle.</p>
<p>&#12288;Alec has been working out with the soldiers, and Sagami has borrowed some of the soldiers from Margarete to train them as secret agents. Fairis was being worshipped like a goddess by the soldiers as she healed the wounded soldiers. She was too embarrassed to deny it, though.</p>
<p>&#12288;As for me, when I wasn't training with Elle, I was repairing the broken walls. Originally, I was just going to rebuild the missing north watchtower, but thanks to that, I was popular among the operatives. I'm not the most popular hero among the other soldiers, though.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle's training is going well for the most part. In the beginning, she was trapped in the common sense of this world, but once I took out of the memory of her original magic, her understanding of the magics quickly increased. She has already learned enough knowledge to be able to activate tactical-grade magic, so all she need to do now is train to increase her magic power and improve the accuracy of her magic manipulation.</p>
<p>&#12288;And since that night, Elle has been showing more skinship towards me. However, it wasn't excessive like the other night, and she only hugged me. I don't know how she'll react if I reject her too much, so I allow her to hug me.</p>
<p>&#12288;Winter is approaching, and it's getting so cold outside that I need to put on a jacket. I can see why we can't fight in the winter, since it's so cold now. If I can endure the cold, I will be able to return to the castle where Tia and Sophie are waiting.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, I know well from my life that everything does not work out that way. In a case like this, something will happen. And I was right.</p>
<p>&#12300;It's emergency! There's been a movement in the Demon Empire!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;We were just having breakfast when the message came through.</p>
<p>&#12288;An urgent meeting was being held, and naturally I was invited to attend. The room was as tense as it had been that night, and soldiers were hurriedly preparing maps.</p>
<p>&#12300;I've just received a call from the northern watchtower. They said that the army of the demon empire has finally advanced. Judging from the size of their army, they're probably planning to settle the matter with a mass battle before the winter sets in.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Is the enemy's strength the same as it was in the last attack?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, just from what I've been able to ascertain, there's no doubt that they have more forces than the last time.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't think so. The last time they attacked, they must have inflicted a lot of damage on us. How can there be that many soldiers ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I heard that the number of soldiers hasn't changed much, but the number of demons they are following seems to have increased far more than the last attack. They must be seriously planning to bring this place down.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I listened to the meeting, I was thinking about how I could make the other heroes stand out. Of course, the purpose of this was to create a scapegoat so that I would not be the center of attention.</p>
<p>&#12288;The work of the heroes so far was a bit weak, so I needed to make them act more like heroes in a story that would captivate people's hearts. However, it is difficult for these guys to hunt a large number of demons with their abilities. Even fighting with the two black wolves they were struggling. What should I do?</p>
<p>&#12300;Excuse me for interrupting the meeting!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;During the meeting, a messenger opened the door and came in. When the messenger approached Margarete and gave her an earful, her face, which had been stern until now, suddenly turned pale. Did she receive some very bad news?</p>
<p>&#12300;O-oh, my goodness...&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Apparently the information was quite shocking, and she staggered over to a chair and plopped down on the table, holding her head.</p>
<p>&#12300;They had dragons, of all things.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Were the dragons so powerful that she had forgotten how to speak politely? Looking at the people around her, they all turned pale and speechless at her words, so I guess I was right.</p>
<p>&#12300;But we have heroes, don't we?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;One of the commanders is trying to inspire everyone. The expressions of the other improved somewhat at his words, but only Margarete remained pale, as if to deny his words.</p>
<p>&#12300;If it's just a dragon, we'll be fine. ...... but they had a "Red Scale". ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That can't be! How did they get that monster to obey them!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The people other than the heroes were too flustered by her words, so I asked what kind of monster it was.</p>
<p>&#12288;The "Red Scale", as the name implies, are a dragon with bright red scales. They live in the mountains of the northern part of the Demon Empire, and sometimes they come down to the foot of the mountains to attack prey in the area. It is said that one normal dragon is strong enough to bring down a large city, but its "Red Scale" are strong enough to feed on other dragons.</p>
<p>&#12288;This is the first time I've seen a dragon that is so powerful that it can feed on other dragons.</p>
<p>&#12288;The atmosphere in the meeting room was at its worst due to the desperate information that had been brought to them. Well, that's what usually happens.</p>
<p>&#12288;But for me, this is a unique opportunity. If I can defeat that "Red Scale" here, I can raise the fame of the heroes at once. I think Alec would be a good choice to become a hero here. He'll probably be the most popular, so he'll be a good cover.</p>
<p>&#12288;Also, Fairis is already popular, so it's okay, but me and Sagami should have a certain role. I'll take out a bunch of other demons, too.</p>
<p>&#12288;I took the three of them out of the meeting room, saying that I wanted to talk to the heroes alone for a moment.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-dono, what is it you want to talk about?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahh, we're going to use our power to defeat the dragon called "Red Scale".&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;But according to Margarete, the dragon is a very powerful demon. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The three of them look at me with puzzled expressions, and I activate my &lt;<ruby>Thought-Guiding<rt>Guidepost</rt></ruby>&gt;. The fact that the magic works on them without even any kind of resistance makes me sad, but I don't care about that right now. If you don't defeat that dragon, I'll be in trouble.</p>
<p>&#12300;From my point of view, the only one who can defeat that dragon is you, Alec-dono.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Me? But I don't think I can defeat that dragon on my own.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, you can. You may not realize it, but there is a hidden power in your sword. If you unleash it, you will be able to unleash more power than the phenomenon that wiped out the mountain the other day. I am telling you this because I am aware of that power.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Is that true!? It is true that this sword given to me by the Great Spirit still contains a number of powers that I am unaware of, but I never thought that my sword really had such power. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;All right, he believe it. That's good. I knew he'd be easy to trust others.</p>
<p>&#12288;By the way, Alec is also saying that there is an unknown power in the sword, and it's true. It's a self-destruct magic for the final battle, considering the composition of the magic. It is a magic that uses the sword and the user's magic power to cause the magic to run wild.</p>
<p>&#12288;Even in his original world, he was treated as a disposable pawn. Alec is a poor man.</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't worry about the other demons, just head straight for the dragon. Perhaps the moment you attack it, it will unleash its hidden power. The other demons will be dealt with by myself and Sagami-dono. Is that okay with you, Sagami-dono?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Sure, You can leave them to me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Um, what should I do, ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I need you in the rear to inspire and heal the soldiers. They will probably be too frightened to fight until the "Red Scale" are defeated, but at least give them enough courage not to run away in the face of the enemy. This is something that only Fairis-dono, who is popular among the soldiers, can do.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Very well. I'm not as good as those of you who are taking on dangerous roles, but I will do my best.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;My talk has motivated the heroes. The preparations were now complete. If I don't make a mistake in the timing of activating the magic formula, Alec will become a hero.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12300;I want you all to listen up! We will defeat the "Red Scale"! Until then, please don't be intimidated and fight to the best of your ability!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Currently, almost everyone in the fortress has gathered before going into battle. Margarete has already finished explaining the strategy, and now Alec is giving a speech on behalf of the heroes.</p>
<p>&#12288;It seems that everyone knows that the "Red Scale" are coming out, and there is already enough unrest among the soldiers that some are trying to run away. I pretended to be listening to his speech while I drew a magic circle on the ground with a staff I picked up.</p>
<p>&#12288;The Fourth Type of Tactical Class Magic that I'll invoked is the &lt;Mass Inspiration&gt;. This is a magic that designates a target within range, in this case a soldier of the kingdom, to alleviate the fear of the target, put them in a state of excitement, and make them resistant to mental attacks. The expression of the upset soldiers tightened as the magic was activated.</p>
<p>&#12300;All right, everyone is ready! Let's fight with all our might!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;With Alec's words, the soldiers went to their respective posts. I was about to join the other heroes when I felt a tug on my arm. I looked over and saw Elle with a worried expression.</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, are you sure we'll be okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, Alec is motivated, and as long as nothing serious happens, we should be fine.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;But if something should happen, ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't worry, I'm just being quiet because I don't want to show off. Even if Alec is defeated, I'm the only one who can handle the battlefield. I promise I'll be back no matter what. Or do you think I'm so weak that you have to worry about me?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;N-no! Master is very strong!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Then don't worry. There is nothing to worry about.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I patted her on the head and left her side. When I looked back, I saw her smiling reassuringly, so I raised my hand lightly and then headed down to the heroes. I'll pat myself on the back and say that was a little cool.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;Since there were many demons used for sieges among the enemies, the three heroes including myself and the troops trained by Sagami were waiting on the high ground away from the fortress.</p>
<p>&#12288;We could already hear the sounds of battle elsewhere. It was only a matter of time before war broke out here.</p>
<p>&#12288;Then, from the right of our army, an enemy force launched a surprise attack. They seemed to be a demon unit centered around a fast-footed black wolf. The troops on the right side collapsed in the blink of an eye due to the suprise attack.</p>
<p>&#12288;After a delay, the nearby soldiers went to reinforce them and managed to hold the line.&#12288;</p>
<p>&#12288;Our troops were originally supposed to be assigned to the right side, but in the morning, Margarete suddenly changed the assignment. She probably thought that there was someone on the kingdom side who was leaking information, but it seems that her prediction came true.</p>
<p>&#12288;Hearing the roar of the demons and the shouting of the enemy soldiers, Alec and the rest of the troops stopped trying to head in that direction.</p>
<p>&#12288;If he were to head out there, the mission would be ruined. My goal is to defeat the enemy's main force and the "Red Scale".</p>
<p>&#12288;But the difference in strength is hopeless. I can see that the morale of my allies has plummeted to the bottom. The only thing I can do is to kill the "Red Scale" instantly with a flashier-than-planned magic and crush the enemy's morale.</p>
<p>&#12288;A little while after the battle on the right began, the enemy's main force came into view from the front.</p>
<p>&#12288;There were many demons and magicians with them, and above them flew a crimson lizard-like creature. At a quick glance, the creature was about fifty meters tall. That must be the "Red Scale".</p>
<p>&#12288;The sight of the dragon depressed the morale of the soldiers, who had thought they were at rock bottom, and they began to panic when they saw the enemy's main force approaching. I'm scared of that thing, too. If it falls, I'll be crushed. I don't blame the soldiers for being scared.</p>
<p>&#12288;Attack magics and demons were unleashed on the frightened Kingdom soldier. The magic jammers that I had put up beforehand made the magics disappear before they reached us, but the demons kept coming at us.</p>
<p>&#12288;The most terrifying of them all is the "Red Scale". I'm sure the kingdom's soldiers have the guts not to run away when they see it coming towards them. If I couldn't use my magic, I'm pretty sure I'd run away at once.</p>
<p>&#12288;Alec also has his sword at the ready, but the tip of his sword is slightly shaky. <span style="font-style: italic;">Don't lose your confidence at the last minute. If you get stopped at this point, my plan will be ruined</span>. I have to do something.</p>
<p>&#12288;I thought I'd confuse them a bit, so I applied &lt;Madness&gt; to the "Red Scale", and to my surprise, it worked beautifully. Suddenly, the dragon went on a rampage, overriding the control of the magicians and attacking the surrounding soldiers and demons.</p>
<p>&#12288;Alec exhaled loudly and nodded toward me, as if he saw an opportunity in this terrible situation. His expression showed that he was full of confidence. He seemed to have regained his confidence.</p>
<p>&#12300;This is our chance! Both of you, let's go!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Roger that!&#12301;</p>
<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://i.imgur.com/5TzQbSq.jpg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="562" height="800" src="https://i.imgur.com/5TzQbSq.jpg" width="562" /></a></div><br /><p><br /></p>
			<p>&#12288;Alec starts running with a shout, and Sagami follows him. I'm in the rear guard, working with Sagami to accurately eliminate the enemies that jump out in front of Alec as he attempts a frontal breakthrough.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-dono, this magic is amazing! It can even easily pierce the fur of a black wolf that was completely unstoppable!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Sagami used to be unable to stand up to the black wolf, but thanks to the &lt;Acceleration&gt; I put on his gun, he's fighting like a different person.</p>
<p>&#12288;I start to secretly draw a magic circle. While playing with the composition of the magic formula so that it would be triggered by the marker that I secretly put on Alec's sword, I killed the attacking demons as if it was a coincidence.</p>
<p>&#12288;In the meantime, Alec had reached the bottom of the "Red Scale". He stopped and confronted the "Red Scale". But the "Red Scale" is not looking at him, or perhaps it doesn't even notice him.</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh my Sword! Lend me the power to defeat this demon!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The truth is, if he knew the truth, it would certainly become a black history for him. From the point of view of "Red Scale", it doesn't even care that someone like him is cutting into it, so it doesn't even look at him.</p>
<p>&#12288;But that was the death of it. As soon as Alec's sword was about to hit it, I activated the magic circle I had drawn on his sword.</p>
<p>&#12288;A huge ray of light was shot out from the tip of the sword, enough to envelop the entire "Red Scale". After the ray of light disappeared, all that was left was the remnants of the "Red Scale", almost all of which had been gutted in an instant.</p>
<p>&#12288;This was the power of the Type 4 Strategic Class Magic, the &lt;<ruby>Aurora<rt>Greater Laser</rt></ruby>&gt;. This magic releases a special high-intensity laser that nullifies the opponent's magical resistance and magical barriers. No matter if it is resistant to heat or light, it will turn everything it hits into plasma, making physical defense impossible. Incidentally, its effective range is roughly 20 million kilometers.</p>
<p>&#12288;Seeing the wreckage of the dragon, which had died in an instant and lost the magic power needed to fly, slammed into the ground, the soldiers of both armies froze in surprise, wondering what had happened. The only sound was the moaning of the enemy soldiers near the "Red Scale", who were staggering around, their skin and eyes burned by the diffused light and heat of the lasers, as the wreckage of what had been enemy soldiers caught in the lasers and vaporized in an instant rolled about.</p>
<p>&#12300;The "Red Scale" have been defeated! Soldiers of the Kingdom, follow us!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Alec raised his sword and shouted in a loud voice that echoed across the battlefield. At the same time, I telephatically to the fortress that the "Red Scale" had been defeated by Alec.</p>
<p>&#12288;Immediately, the kingdom's army cheered and increased the momentum of their attack. The soldiers of the demon empire, whose trump card was killed in an instant, were so confused that they could no longer hold their shape as an army, and were defeated by the kingdom soldiers one after another.</p>
<p>&#12288;The rest of the time, it was like hunting for the remnants. I secretly went after the demons that the soldiers couldn't handle, and the enemy soldiers who hadn't run away and fought until the end were hunted down by the two heroes and the soldiers.</p>
<p>&#12288;The end was surprisingly quick, but while we lost less than a hundred people, the other side lost half of their total. Since the original difference in strength was more than ten times, this victory was like a miracle for the kingdom.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;When we returned to the fortress, we were greeted by loud cheers. The guys who looked like they were dying a few moments ago were now laughing.</p>
<p>&#12288;Alec was surrounded by many people, admiring him and asking him questions. They were all asking about the light at that time, but it would be impossible to explain a magic that even he didn't understand the principle of. Even now, he's only saying that it's thanks to the power of the Great Spirit.</p>
<p>&#12288;A good number of people had gathered around me and Sagami, but as I don't like to be surrounded by people, I decided to take refuge near Elle. Some people still seemed to think that Elle was one of their enemy, and quite a few people stopped coming near me.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elle was so happy that I had returned safely that she was serving me with smile..</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, is it okay if you don't go over there? I'm sure you'll be welcomed like the other heroes.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't like noisy things&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... May I join you here?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What are you talking about? You're my disciple, aren't you? There's no way I'd complain about you being around me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;!! Right!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She replies, not even trying to hide her joy at my words. I had just run out of sake, so I asked her to get me some more.</p>
<p>&#12300;I didn't know the guest of honor would be at this corner. Yard-sama, everyone wants to hear about your saga, too.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Margarete came over to me, probably wondering why I was at the corner. The princess didn't even bother to call me.</p>
<p>&#12300;The star of the day was probably Alec-dono. Compared to him, my performance is nothing to speak of.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh my, don't be so modest. I've heard that you defeated many demons. Besides, wouldn't it be nice to share the joy of victory with everyone?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;After all, this battle is only a temporary fix. When the winter is over and the cold weather eases, the Demon Empire will attack with an even larger army. Let's not rejoice until the war with the Demon Empire is over.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... You are a tactless person. Even so, if you have won a great victory against a large army, you should be able to say something of joy. That's what the soldiers want.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't like to stand out, so I'll leave that task to you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hmph, I still don't like you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see, that's too bad.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Without waiting for my reply, she started to go back, but after a short walk, she stopped and looked back at me.</p>
<p>&#12300;Right, right, I know it's sudden, but the heroes will have to return to the royal castle first. The departure is tomorrow, so please make your preparations tonight. Also, you may take the girl with you, but that's as far as I can allow you. Please take care of the troubles that will arise from her living in the kingdom by yourself.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I didn't expect Margarete-dono to be worried about me. I guess you didn't hate me as much as I thought.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, it's just that your insolence is too much to bear! Don't get me wrong!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It was unusual for her to be less spineless than usual, so I teased her a bit, but I think I offended her. She scowled grumpily and went back.</p>
<p>&#12288;It would be nice to be able to return tomorrow, but hadn't the original plan been to keep defending it until winter? No matter how many enemy hordes we drove back, wouldn't it be normal to leave until safety was assured?</p>
<p>&#12288;Could it be that something is going on at the castle?</p>
<p>&#12288;I thought about it, and reminded myself that I was overthinking it. I'm sure I'm just relaxed by our victory. Now that I know this place is, I can always come back here if I need to.</p>
<p>&#12288;I thought it was more important to try not to let the festivities drag on into tomorrow, so I headed back to my room with Elle.</p>
