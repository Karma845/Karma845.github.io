<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Duel with the Knight, Vow with the Princess</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.1</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;Now that I had the bath I had always wanted, I was beginning to feel glad that I had come to this world. It's not that I don't have any regrets about my former world, but more than that, I'm getting used to life in this world.</p>
<p>&#12288;The best thing about it is that I can spend most of my day doing what I want. In my old world, I was sometimes ordered by my superiors to do research on magics that I didn't want to do, but here, I can do as many experiments as I want. There are no quotas. It was heaven.</p>
<p>&#12288;That's why I've been working in the laboratory almost every day since I got the mansion, but as the winter season started to get colder and colder, I received a call from the castle for the first time in a long time.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I went there, I found that the other heroes had also been called, except for Fairis, but they all had no idea why they were called.</p>
<p>&#12288;Aside from Fairis, the fact that he called in the heroes whose only claim to fame was their ability to fight, I wonder if they are having trouble with the Demon Empire again. I've heard that the Demon Empire has temporarily stopped moving during the winter.</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh Heroes, you have come well. There is a task that I would really like you to do.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;A job? What is it?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Fumu, actually, I want you to go to Leshiana in the northwest of this country and form an alliance with the elves.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Leshiana, I've heard of it. As I recall, there are only elves in this country.</p>
<p>&#12288;Leshiana is originally the Great Forest of Leshiana, where the country of the elves is located. There is no official name for the land of the elves. For the sake of convenience, the rest of the world borrows the name of the land and calls it Leshiana.</p>
<p>&#12288;The elves of Leshiana have more magical power than humans, but they don't want to get involved with other races. On the contrary, they mercilessly kill any non-Elves who try to enter the depths of the forest.</p>
<p>&#12288;The Wood Elves and High Elves live in the forest, and only the Wood Elves show themselves to people. The High Elves never show themselves to people.</p>
<p>&#12288;The reason I know about the elves I've never seen before is because the elves in this country are trading with each other, and that's how the information leaked out.</p>
<p>&#12300;But why did you think of forming an alliance now? If you want to prepare for the threat of the Demon Empire, I think you should have asked for an alliance earlier.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;There is a reason for this. The elves of Leshiana speak only Elvish. The elves don't like their language to be known to humans, so we couldn't find anyone who could speak it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;So, as heroes, we have the ability to translate, so we can talk to them?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Thank you for quick on uptake. When the winter is over, the Demon Empire will attack our country again. I have faith in your abilities, but even so, your strength is not enough. We need to get the help of the elves before the Demon Empire begins its march.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I understand, Your Majesty. I'm sure the elves will cooperate with us once they learn of the Demon Empire's actions. Please allow us to take on this task.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Umu, I was hoping you would say that. Please help the other two to cooperate with Alec-dono and form an alliance with the elves.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;At your service.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Lesiana, I don't think they'll join forces with us in any way, since they've been watching the war between the Demon Empire and the kingdom but not participating in the fight.</p>
<p>&#12288;If they are able to trade, they would have elves who can speak the kingdom language. It's not like they couldn't make an alliance because they can't speak with Kingdom.</p>
<p>&#12288;The negotiations may fail, but it's not so bad if you think of it as an opportunity to see different kinds of elves. If I wanted to, I could bring back some samples, but if I did that and angered the elves, it wouldn't be a problem at the level of failed negotiations, so I decided not to do that this time.</p>
<p>&#12288;It was decided that we would leave for Leshiana in three days. I decided that it would be better for the negotiations if I did some research on the situation of the elves. I'm more interested in the research once we get there than the history, though.</p>
<p>&#12288;They said they were going to do some research in the archives, so I told them I would go talk to Elle and let them go home before me.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12300;Yard-sama!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was walking down the corridor, Sophie came running at me with great speed for a girl like her. She jumped into the air with such force that I hurried to catch her, but the force was more than I expected and my body turned over a little. I guess it's because I've been taking a break from exercising lately. I need to reflect on that.</p>
<p>&#12288;She was out of breath and hugged me. I looked around to see if anyone else was watching and, relieved that no one was, I gently pulled her away.</p>
<p>&#12300;What's the matter, Sophie? If you're in such a hurry, is there something serious you need to tell me?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I heard that Yard-sama is going to Leshiana this time. ...... It hasn't even been a month since you came back here, and I can't believe I have to be separated from Yard-sama again. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Apparently, she had already heard about our trip to Leshiana. It was impossible to say no, but it was a little annoying that it had been decided before I got confirmation.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sophie, this is the king's order. I'm not going because I want to be away from you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;But I still miss you. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She hugged me again, but I wasn't sure if I should shake her off here or not. Unlike the &lt;Dominate&gt; , individual with the &lt;<ruby>Thought-Guiding<rt>Guidepost</rt></ruby>&gt; can not be forced to obey, so if she does not like it here, I will have to waste effort to repair the relationship.</p>
<p>&#12288;I had no choice but to hug her back, and she leaned towards me and put her body against mine. From the side, it looks like we're lovers. I can only hope that no one is watching us.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She was staring at me with moist eyes, but then she closed her eyes and brought her face to mine. No matter how I look at her, she is waiting for me to kiss her, so I gently put my lips on hers and quickly let go. It's not safe to linger in the hallway.</p>
<p>&#12288;She seemed to know that, and without complaining, she pulled away from me and smiled.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama, let's continue in my room: ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You bastard! What the hell are you doing there!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When I turned around at the voice that suddenly interrupted her words, there was a young man there. He was another typical blond-haired, blue-eyed nobleman, but again, he looked unfamiliar.</p>
<p>&#12288;Sophie seemed to know who this guy was and looked at him with a slightly troubled expression.</p>
<p>&#12288;As the man approached us, he ignored me and turned to face Sophie with a fresh smile on his face.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sophia-sama, I never thought I'd see you in a place like this.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, I'm glad to see that you're doing well too, Thomas-sama.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Sophie responded in a slightly withdrawn manner. He didn't seem to care about that, and his whole body seemed to be filled with an atmosphere of wanting to talk to her, but when he noticed her looking at me for help, he crowded me with an expression that didn't even try to hide his displeasure.</p>
<p>&#12300;You bastard, are one of the heroes ...... uh, what was it ......, whatever.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The man stood so as to hide Sophie from my gaze and pointed his finger at me.</p>
<p>&#12300;You bastard, Sophia-sama, are the one who should be tied to me! She's not someone that a lowly person like you should touch!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, uh, Yard-sama, this is not right. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I think it's disrespectful to speak like a betrothed without the King's permission.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Perhaps unaware of Sophie's denial, the man began to talk about Sophie's relationship with him, which she had not been asked about.</p>
<p>&#12288;This guy's name is Thomas Burkfield, and he's the eldest son of the Count of Burkfield. He fell in love with Sophie at first sight when he met her at the ball where he made his debut in society, and he has been courting her ever since.</p>
<p>&#12288;If he's been rejected after all that, I'm sure he doesn't have a pulse at all, but he seems to be conveniently assuming that she's waiting for him to succeed him as Count.</p>
<p>&#12300;And yet, if you are a nobleman, you should be ashamed of yourself for forcing yourself into Sophia-sama's arms and forcing her to kiss you. ......! No, your apology won't change the fact that you hurt her, and even if she forgives you, I will never forgive you!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Then what should I do ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Duel! If you lose, repent for what you've done to her and swear never to approach her again!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Thomas-sama, don't be so selfish!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, it's all right, Sophia-sama. I fully understand your feelings. I will definitely defeat this fool.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It seems that this guy is the type of person who doesn't listen to others. In his mind, he must have conveniently interpreted her words as a sign of concern for him.</p>
<p>&#12288;Sophie was completely uncomfortable, but he could see the anxiety on her face, so he told her to relax. He also tried to hug her, but she avoided him.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, but I have some research to do, so I don't have time for a duel.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Tomorrow! I'll be waiting for you in the training grounds of the castle, starting early tomorrow morning! If you fail to keep your word, you will be brought to justice by His Majesty the King for insulting the royal family! Come on, Sophia-sama. There is no harm in staying with such a person. I'll escort you to your room.&#12300;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, please stop it! I'll talk to Yard-sama ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;After saying that, he left the place quickly, taking Sophie with him. He was like a storm.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm sorry for her sacrifice, but I think I'll go talk to Elle about the elves of Leshiana.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12300;I don't think it's any use going to place like that, you know?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;That's what Elle said when I asked her about Leshiana.</p>
<p>&#12288;The elves of Leshiana hate humans, and even the elves who live beside the humans are objects of contempt. She was quite surprised when she heard that they were trading with this country.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I asked her about the High Elves, she told me that they live in the magic pool in the center of the forest and have much stronger magic than the other elves. Only a few Wood Elves are allowed to meet them, and even she doesn't know the details.</p>
<p>&#12300;I see, well, that makes forming an alliance seem all but impossible. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, by the way, there are a lot of interesting rumors about the High Elves. Some say that they created the magic and that they don't come out of the forest because they would die if they did. Also, unlike other elves, they live very short lives.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't think that's useful information. Do you have any more information that might lead us to negotiations?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, I don't know any more. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I don't think I can get any more out of her, so next I'll look at the orb that extracted her memories. But all I could find out was that the Demon Empire was trying to contact them. Maybe they're already on the side of the Demon Empire.</p>
<p>&#12300;Speaking of which, Master. You seemed to be in a bad mood when you came back, did something happen?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, I got tangled up with some idiots. I got caught up in a lot of trouble.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It's one thing after another to get into trouble. I wish I didn't have to do this.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'll get rid of this resentment by loving on Tia tonight.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;The next day, I went to the training grounds as promised and found Thomas already waiting for me. I can see some other people there, but I guess they are observers and spectators. Sophie, the central figure of this commotion, is also there.</p>
<p>&#12288;Thomas was wearing his knight's armor and holding his training sword. According to what I've heard, he's good enough to win a prize in a sword fighting competition.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm surprised you didn't run away. Well, I guess you thought it would be better for Sophia-sama's mind than running away with your tail between your legs, but it didn't make much difference. You should regret that I was your opponent.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Enough of this nonsense, let's get on with it. I don't have time to waste on this kind of thing.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;How long can you afford to do that?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;One of the observers hands me a sword. I never thought I would have to use a sword, but I asked Tia about dueling etiquette yesterday, just in case.</p>
<p>&#12288;As a rule, the use of magic is prohibited, and the use of magical tools is also prohibited. The basic rule is to stop short, but it's not a foul if you strike. The use of pre-determined weapons, other than swords in this case, is prohibited. Of course, bare hands are also not allowed. You win if your opponent says "I give up" or if you knock them out of the fight by popping their weapon. It's not a foul if you accidentally kill them.</p>
<p>&#12288;It's not the kind of rule that a magician would play by, but perhaps because he thinks that dueling is only allowed for knights in the first place, the rules are also tailored to knights.</p>
<p>&#12288;I tried swinging the sword, but it was still heavy, even for training. If this thing hits me, I'm sure I'll break a few bones.</p>
<p>&#12300;You bastard, hurry up and put on your armor.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, I don't need to wear the armor. Let's get started.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You bastard, If you think I'm going to go easy on you if you don't have your armor on, you're mistaken!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Seeing that the two of us were ready, the witness stepped forward. The people around us, who seemed to be tense between the two of us, watched with bated breath.</p>
<p>&#12300;We will now begin the duel between Thomas Barkfield and Yard Al Werner. Both of you must give it your all so that you have no regrets. ...... Begin!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I got youuuuuuu!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I threw my sword without hesitation at Thomas, who rushed in at the same time as the referee signaled. It's not only the spectators, but also the witnesses and my opponent, Thomas, who froze in surprise at the act.</p>
<p>&#12288;The sword flew with a speed that could not have been thrown by a human, shattering his armor and hitting Thomas in the stomach, sending him flying into the wall of the training ground. It was a good thing it was a training sword. If it had been a steel sword, it would have gone through his armor and killed him.</p>
<p>&#12288;The throwing and throwing target was the effect of the &lt;Sharpshooting&gt; I had applied before coming here. It's a magic that greatly increases the accuracy and power of a target's shooting or throwing. It was originally intended for sniping, but if used at close range, it can produce deadly force.</p>
<p>&#12288;I could see the suspicion gathering in their eyes at the improbable sight of a thrown sword blowing up a man. Did you really think I was going to do it fair and square? I'm a magician, you knew I wouldn't be able to win if I fought him with just my strength and skill.</p>
<p>&#12288;Thomas collapsed in a heap. A witness approached him and confirmed that he was unconscious.</p>
<p>&#12300;Thomas Burkfield is deemed unable to continue the fight, and Yard Al Werner is declared as the winner!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When the witness announced this, several people rushed over to Thomas. They were trying to bring him back to consciousness by slapping his cheeks and shaking him, but wouldn't that cause him to pass out again from the intense pain?</p>
<p>&#12288;As I got closer, I saw that he was bleeding from his mouth, and his stomach area was oddly concave. It seems that his internal organs have been ripped open, so I'm going to put on my &lt;Major Heal&gt; and fix him back up. Even though it was an accusation, he challenged me to a duel head-on, and I wasn't harmed enough to let him die.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I moved away from him, Sophie came running up to me. She didn't hug me because it was in front of a lot of people, but I could see that she was giving me a passionate look.</p>
<p>&#12300;I was sure that you would win. Thank you for doing this for me. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't worry about it. It's just that I originally got involved on my own.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;While I was wondering what to do about Sophie, who looked like she was about to hug me, Thomas seemed to have regained consciousness. He stood up, holding his stomach, and walked over to us with a unsteady walk.</p>
<p>&#12300;You bastard used magic. You should be ashamed of yourself for being so tactless in a sacred duel!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Please don't accuse me. If I had used magic, the fight would have been stopped there. If you disagree, protest to the witnesses.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Thomas glared at the witness, but the witness shook his head hurriedly. That means there was no cheating.</p>
<p>&#12288;Of course, I didn't invoke any magics during the match. I just applied a body-strengthening formula with a duration. The witnesses were puzzled, but they must have decided that it would be difficult to pursue the matter since there was no evidence.</p>
<p>&#12300;You bastard should not think that you have won with this. It is an insult to a sacred duel to throw a sword, the pride of a knight. I will make sure you pay for this.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Thomas-sama! Insulting the outcome of a duel is shameful behavior!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Thomas glared at me, holding his mouth in frustration, as if he could see that Sophie was angry.</p>
<p>&#12288;As if he couldn't think of any other reason to blame me for not committing any foul play, he clicked his tongue and was about to leave the training ground, but I wasn't done talking yet.</p>
<p>&#12300;Wait, I still haven't decided on the reward for my victory.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hah, guess what, ah that's what you meant. Fine, say it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Then you are forbidden to approach Princess Sophia in the future. And while you're at it, you can apologize for all the insults you've done to me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;!? You bastard!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It shouldn't be much different from the conditions you gave me, what do you have to complain about?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;.....Kuhh, I'm sorry for all the trouble I've caused you. I apologize for my behavior.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Thomas apologizes to me in a barbed tone of voice, not even hiding his regretfully twisted expression. He didn't look remorseful by any stretch of the imagination, but it was the expected reaction, so I decided to let it slide.</p>
<p>&#12288;He looked up, glared at me, and walked away.</p>
<p>&#12288;The way he was leaving, I had a feeling he was about to do something. It's not a good to have my family members targeted, so I might want to reinforce the warding of my mansion just in case.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I was leaving the training grounds, Sophie asked me if she can to take a look at my mansion, but I politely declined. I didn't know what kind of rumors would start if I took her there after such a duel.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I looked at her with a sad expression on her face, I felt my head start to hurt at the thought of having to go along with her good mood again.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;After the act at the training grounds, the three male heroes, including myself, gathered in the library to exchange information about the elves of Leshiana.</p>
<p>&#12288;A large number of books were placed there, reminding me of my old laboratory. At the time, I never thought I would be sent to this world, but as they say, you never know what will happen in life.</p>
<p>&#12300;What do you think, did you get any information from the girl?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, she didn't know anything about it. The only thing she know is that the High Elves have a rumor that's a bit of an urban legend.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see, I couldn't find anything in the archives that said anything like that either. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It seems that Alec didn't have any information as well as I did. I turned to him and he nodded to us both with a serious look on his face, thinking that we couldn't expect anything from Sagami either.</p>
<p>&#12300;Actually, I was able to make contact with an elf who knows what's going on in the forest.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What! Is that true?!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, they told me about their lives and rules. They didn't seem to be able to tell us anything about the High Elves, though.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Sagami passed on the information he had heard to us. Their life is mainly hunting and gathering, no farming.</p>
<p>&#12288;The rule is that no language other than Elvish is to be used. As a general rule, elves are not allowed to go outside except for those who go to trade. Do not cut down trees in the forest without permission. Do not talk about the High Elves to other races.</p>
<p>&#12288;There were many things that sounded troublesome, but I was particularly interested in the rules regarding High Elves. I wondered if the High Elves were that important to the elves of Leshiana.</p>
<p>&#12300;Also, on a different note from the previous information, I heard that High Elves are very short-lived. I've heard that this is supposed to be a secret, so don't tell anyone.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;How short-lived are they? An Elf with a short life expectancy, a hundred years?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I've heard they don't even last 20 years.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Are you sure it's an elf? Even halflings can live for a hundred years or more without a care in the world, and that's the race of elves, right? Or are elves just animals in name only or something?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't know that much. I'll have to see them in person.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;If we assume that High Elves have a body similar to that of Elves, then it seems that High Elves are a race with a defective body structure. Otherwise, they wouldn't be able to die in 20 years.</p>
<p>&#12288;I don't even know how they keep their species alive if they can't live for 20 years in the first place. I wonder if it has something to do with the magic reservoir in Lesiana.</p>
<p>&#12300;Can't we meet the person who provided us with that information?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahh, he said that what he told me should not be used for anything other than this matter. I also made a promise not to approach him about this anymore.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, well, that's no help then.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;In the end, there was no further information, so we were dismissed for the day. They both said they would continue to investigate, but honestly, I don't think we'll get any more information, so went home first.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.2</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;When I got home, I found an invitation in the mail. The sender was Simon Ray Burkfield, the head of the Burkfield family, that is, Thomas' father.</p>
<p>&#12288;I wondered if he was angry about my duel with his son? I don't want to go, because I can't think of anything else, and the only thing I can think of is a duel, but unfortunately, refusing an invitation from a person with a higher rank is considered bad manners and will get you kicked out.</p>
<p>&#12288;I had no choice but to tell Tia that I didn't want dinner, so I rode my horse to the Barkfield residence in the west district.</p>
<p>&#12288;I entered the west district and found the Count's mansion a little further on. As expected, the Count's mansion was completely different in size from mine. First of all, the mansion alone was more than twice the size of mine. If I include the garden, it might be even bigger.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I stood at the gate admiring the mansion, a man who looked like a servant came over to me.</p>
<p>&#12288;The Count of Berkefield was already sitting at the table where the meal had been prepared. He seemed to be a former knight, so he had a pretty good body.</p>
<p>&#12300;Oooh, I'm glad you've come. Please, take a seat.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I took my seat, the food was brought to me. The food looked more expensive than what I was used to at home, but as I wasn't really interested in eating, I kept my attention on the Count who had suddenly invited me.</p>
<p>&#12288;After enjoying the entire meal, the Count spoke to me with a satisfied look on his face.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry about what happened today. My son, Thomas, has always been crazy about Her Highness Princess Sophia.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, I think it was my fault as well. I was going to withdraw my promise after a while.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see. No, no, I'm glad. I was also worried that something like this would put a damper on the relationship between Thomas and Her Highness Princess Sophia. They've both always seemed to be on good terms with each other.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Fumu, so those two were that close.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm returning flattery as appropriate, but he's being a little too parental. If I said they were close, stalker victims all over the world would be protesting.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm more concerned about the fact that Thomas hasn't shown up at all. I thought he was going to secretly poison my food, so I took the trouble to prepare an antidote for me.</p>
<p>&#12288;Or would he attack me on the way home? Since I don't know what the other party is going to do, I decide to try to find out what the situation is.</p>
<p>&#12300;Speaking of which, what happened to Thomas-dono? I haven't seen him since a while ago.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, he has some business to attend to, so he's not at home at the moment.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What kind of business is it?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, I hadn't heard that much about from him. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;This guy is suspicious too. It's impossible for him to disappear at dinner time. In this world where there are no electric lights, it gets really dark at night. The only things that need to be done in this situation are things that are really urgent or things that you want to keep secret.</p>
<p>&#12288;Finally, I understood the situation. The reason he invited me to dinner was to stop me. So, Thomas is after Sophie, right?</p>
<p>(I hope you're doing well now, Thomas, after your absurd suggestion of stopping this creepy guy. ......)</p>
<p>&#12288;When I invoked the &lt;Mind Steal&gt; on the Count, it seems that I was right. The mansion is warded, so there is no problem even if they are attacked. It's Sophie, huh</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, Count, but I've remembered something urgent, so I have to leave.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It would be fine if you took your time. Is your urgent business that important?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, it's more than that.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;While I was talking, I activated the magic circle that I had completed. While looking across at the Count's face, which was startled by the light emitted by the magic circle, the Fourth Type of Space Jumping magic, &lt;<ruby>Advanced-Transfer<rt>Greater Teleportation</rt></ruby>&gt;, was activated, and I transferred to the specified coordinates, that's Sophie's room.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;When I was transferred to the other side, I saw Thomas sitting on the bed and Sophie in his arms.</p>
<p>&#12288;Thomas is startled by my sudden appearance, but quickly regains his composure at the advantageous situation he is in, and smiles wryly at me.</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, well, well, Associate Baron Werner. How dare you invade the princess's room at this time of night with so much disrespect?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's my line, Thomas. You are either a daredevil fool or else just plain stupid to be in a royal room at this hour. How on earth did you manage to sneak into this room?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's out of my mind to sneak in. Of course the maids and soldiers were happy to let me through.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... This is the worst security system in the country, to be bought off by someone like this.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I have no idead what you're saying. I'm here because Sophia invited me. Isn't that right, Sophia?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ah ...... ah, nn ...... yeshh, ah nn ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Sophie, who was being talked to, looked at me with unfocused eyes. She was already naked, and her crotch was dripping with love juice.</p>
<p>&#12288;Whenever he ran his fingers over her breasts or clitoris, she made a pleasurable sound. He seems to have drugged her or something.</p>
<p>&#12300;Look, she's also accepting my caresses and moaning with pleasure! I hadn't expected this intrusion, but now I'm going to show you how it's done! Oi, Sophia, I know you want it here!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh ...... I-I want ........it ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Oh, I see. This is how angry I get, being disrespected by a fool.</p>
<p>&#12288;It doesn't help that Sophie was drugged and is at his mercy. It's still a problem that can be forgiven with an apology. But to be outsmarted and insulted by such a low-life is unforgivable.</p>
<p>&#12288;Unaware of my anger, he was rubbing his cock against her crotch as if to show off his superiority. I can't sense any affection in his behavior. It seems that he just wanted something that would give him status as a princess.</p>
<p>&#12288;There was no need to show mercy to this guy. I'm going to kill him socially, along with his father who helped him.</p>
<p>&#12300;......It seems that you've not kept your promise of a duel.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hah, I'll break any number of promises I make to someone like you. You're only a Associate-baron, so your words are just insignificant nonsense!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Thomas is cursing me to vent his frustration, but it's an act that will mean his own downfall. He doesn't understand the significance of making a pact with a magician.</p>
<p>&#12288;A promise that a magician makes in his own name is now a kind of magic. The person who breaks the promise is no longer able to resist the magic of the other person who broke it. If you have no knowledge of magic, you may think it is easy, but if you have studied even a little bit of magic, you can easily understand the consequences of it.</p>
<p>&#12300;I see, it can't be helped. Why don't you take this instead?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I threw a coin at him and he dutifully accepted it. He flipped the coin over to check it, but when he saw that it was a plain coin, he turned his head and smiled at me.</p>
<p>&#12300;What's this? If it's a parting gift, I'll accept it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;If you hate me, hate your own stupidity for breaking your promise to me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hmm? What are you talking about?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He frowned at my words, but before he could discard the coin from his hand, I activated the &lt;Dominate&gt;. He instantly had a soulless expression on his face, but he quickly returned to his normal face and turned his gaze to me.</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Hmm? Why am I in this place?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't worry about it. Just let her go. She won't be able to rest calmly if you're holding her.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hmm? Oh, I'm sorry.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Gently laying her down on the bed, he stood up, completely naked. To be honest, I don't even want to see him naked, but at least I'll try not to look down.</p>
<p>&#12300;Okay, you can go home now. You have more important things to do than to worry about her, don't you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ah, yes, I do! Wait for me, I'm coming!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Thomas runs out of the room screaming, completely naked. He must be a popular figure in the castle tomorrow morning. Of course, it would be best not to say where he went.</p>
<p>&#12288;It's Sophie. I approached her to check on her, but she had started masturbating on her own, as if the tingling in her body had not subsided. She was smiling with vacant eyes while touching her breasts and crotch.</p>
<p>&#12288;I don't know whether I'm lucky or unlucky to see my little sister's ghostly expression after her.</p>
<p>&#12288;I activate the &lt;Neutralize Poison&gt; that I had prepared but never used, but it seemed that the drug used on her was unexpectedly strong and did not completely stop the tingling in her body, but it worked well enough to bring her back to consciousness, so that was good.</p>
<p>&#12288;A little while later, Sophie woke up. She seemed to be half-asleep and was looking around with a cute little yawn.</p>
<p>&#12300;.......Fuehh? Yard-sama........?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Good evening, Sophie.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Good evening, ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When she realized that I was there, she bowed and looked at me blankly, but eventually she woke up, she realized the situation she was in.</p>
<p>&#12288;She hurriedly hid her body with the sheet and only showed the top of her eyes to look at me. The fact that she didn't scream made me think that she was also royalty.</p>
<p>&#12300;Ah, um, why is Yard-sama in my room ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, I was invited to the Count of Berkeley's mansion, but Thomas wasn't there, so I thought Sophie's safety might be in danger.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Thomas-sama, is it?&#12288;...... ah ......!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Perhaps remembering her earlier lasciviousness, she turns her back to me and pulls the sheet over her head. As I was wondering what to say to her, I heard her sobbing.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm not very good at this kind of situation. From my life experience, I think it would be better to just shut up and listen to what she has to say, but I'm not sure if that's really the right thing to do.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama, I don't have the face to match you anymore. ...... I felt like I was being played by someone, and I said the words that I wanted to ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It was still painful that I didn't make it time. I thought she was still okay because she hadn't been raped, but her heart seemed to be hurting a lot.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'd better reassure her for now. I know that I shouldn't simply agree with her words. All I can say is that I believe in her no matter what happens.</p>
<p>&#12288;I don't want her heart to be broken at this point, in more ways than one.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sophie, look at me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't want to. ...... Please. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Sophie!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She jumped at the sound of my voice and turned around fearfully. I grabbed her by the chin and forcefully kissed her on the mouth. She froze in surprise, but soon understood the situation and began to flail.</p>
<p>&#12288;At first she resisted to leave me, but I held her body and continued to kiss her, until she finally broke down and extended her tongue. We continued our tongue action until she felt safe enough to put her body against mine.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Sophie, I'll tell you this. No matter what happens, I will always love you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahh ......! I-I love you too! No matter what happens, I will always love you, Yard-sama!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She is so emotional that she hugs me. The sheet falls off, exposing her naked body, but she doesn't care and rubs her skin against mine. When I calm down and take a closer look, I can see that her skin is red and the effects of the medicine are still lingering.</p>
<p>&#12288;She seems to be aware of this, and she squeezes my leg between her thighs and rubs it between her legs. The way she stares at me with a hot sigh, she's different from her usual innocent self.</p>
<p>&#12288;But she's still a virgin, and if I end up with her here, I won't be able to physically cheat her.</p>
<p>&#12288;I had two choices: I could go straight to marriage with Sophie, or I could be caught for impiety. In either case, it would take me away from the life I wanted, so I tried to avoid her temptation, and then a thought occurred to me.</p>
<p>&#12288;Why not in the front, but in the back?</p>
<p>&#12288;When I thought about it, I felt like I didn't have to reject her asking me out right in front of me. In fact, I would welcome it. Once I decided that, I had to act.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sophie, let's forget about what happened earlier. First, let's go to my mansion to clean up your body.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama's mansion? But we can't go out at this hour, right?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's all right.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I draw up a magic circle in an instant. I activated the Type 4 Tactical Class Magic, &lt;<ruby>Advanced Mass Transfer<rt>Greater Mass Teleportation</rt></ruby>&gt;, and returned to my house.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;When I transferred to my room, I found Tia in the room, blinking her eyes at our sudden appearance. Even so, she quickly came to her senses and was able to deal with the situation, which is a testament to her calmness.</p>
<p>&#12300;Welcome back, Master. And you must be ...... Sophia-sama. What's going on here?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She seemed to have understood the situation instantly when she saw Sophie, who was only covering her body with a sheet. She didn't mention anything about her outfit and looked at me.</p>
<p>&#12300;No explanation. For now, just get her some clothes to wear and boil a bath for her.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;All right, sir.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I make sure that Tia leaves, and look at Sophie. She was used to having her body looked at by maids, and she didn't react to Tia looking at her, but when she noticed my gaze, she covered her body with the sheet. I felt bad somehow, so I hung up my robe on her shoulders.</p>
<p>&#12288;After a while, Tia brought her a spare maid's uniform, so she changed into it and headed for the bath with Sophie.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama, what kind of place is a bath?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Do you know what a hot spring is?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, I don't know.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, a bath is a very nice thing. Simply put, it is a room with a container filled with water that is slightly warmer than human skin. It's good for resting and cleansing the body.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;My vague explanation didn't seem to make sense to her at all, and she looked at me with a strange look on her face. Well, it was quicker to see it than to explain it, so I headed for the bath, though I was in a bit of a hurry to avoid being seen by the others.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>7.3</strong></p>

<p>&#12300;It's spacious. Is this what you call a bath ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Sophie, who is completely nude, looks into the bathtub filled with hot water and mutters to herself. In this way, she and the bath are very mismatched. Her aristocratic appearance does not match the atmosphere of this bath.</p>
<p>&#12288;Well, I don't care about that, I'm going to wash her first. I beckoned to her, and she approached me, careful of her slippery feet. Of course, she cover her breasts and crotch with her arms, but her breasts don't fit with just one arm, so her cleavage is in full view.</p>
<p>&#12300;What is it?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm going to wash your body. Sit here.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I wash her body with the soap I made mainly for Tia. She looks ticklish, but as she presses her body against mine, I hug her in return.</p>
<p>&#12288;All the people in this world shaved their hairs there, and she seemed to have done the same. I guess she does it because she doesn't have the habit of washing her body, but for me, it's better if she keeps her body in order.</p>
<p>&#12288;After I finished washing her body, she seemed to be ready and looked at me.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama, can you please give me some of Yard-sama's compassion ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Sophie, I need to talk to you about that.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What is it?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No matter how much we love each other, I'm a Associate-baron and you're royalty. It's obvious that even if we are good, people will make a fuss and pull us apart. So could you please wait until I am of a status that allows me to marry you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Yes, Yard-sama is right. I'll give up today. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I patted Sophie's head, who looked very depressed at my words. She seemed to be expecting it, but taking the virginity of royalty was too high a hurdle. But here's my main point.</p>
<p>&#12300;But, Sophie, I also want to be with you. So I think I'll use this place.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hyaahh!? T-that's dirty there ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I've heard that some of those who love each other use this place, so there's nothing wrong with that.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I-is that so? No, if Yard-sama say so, then there is no problem, right?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When I touched my fingers around Sophie's chrysanthemum buds, she showed a sensitive reaction. It may be that the effects of the potion Thomas had given her are still lingering, but she is probably sensitive to begin with.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I poked her chrysanthemum bud with my finger, it tightened up. I repeated the process several times, and gradually her breathing started to pick up. It's a good response for a first time.</p>
<p>&#12300;Come on, Sophie. Let's clean up the inside first.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Fuehh ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As soon as Sophie was on all fours, I prepared the enema machine that I had made for playing with Tia. It was hard to make one from scratch without equipment, but it was almost as if I could make it because I knew the hard work would pay off.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm going to pour the enema liquid inside now, but don't move, okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Y-yes ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I inserted the enema device into her chrysanthemum bud and slowly poured the enema liquid into her.</p>
<p>&#12288;She was shaking a little at the sensation of liquid flowing into her belly, but it seemed to be okay, so I kept pouring it in.</p>
<p>&#12288;As her well-shaped belly began to swell a little, she began to breathe a little harder. I guessed that she was about to have a bowel movement.</p>
<p>&#12300;Y-Yard-sama, are you not finished yet?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, I'm almost done. Just hang in there.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I poured a few more times, until her belly bulged out. She seems to be at the end of her rope, dripping with sweat and trying not to let it out.</p>
<p>&#12300;That's it. Sophie, you can take it out now.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;W-where's I can take it out ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, that hole over there.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I pointed to the hole I made for drainage. Of course, it's not just any hole. Thanks to a magical device that keeps the Dimensional Gate's formula deployed at all times, It is transported to another space.</p>
<p>&#12288;She seems to be confused by the lack of partition. I guess she is embarrassed to be seen.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, since she is in the bath, there is naturally no wall to hide her body. She was weighing up between enduring the urge to defecate and the shame, and the urge to defecate seemed to have won.</p>
<p>&#12288;She struggled to reach the drain, making a gurgling sound like she was hungry.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama, please don't look at me. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What do you want me not to look at?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;T-that's ......! No, no, it's coming out now!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;*psk* After a distracted puffing sound, she let out the liquid that had accumulated inside at once. The sight of the liquid coming out of her chrysanthemum buds with such force was, if anything, a sight to behold.</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahhhhh! Please don't look! Please, don't loooooook!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She was pleading with me in a desperate voice, but my desire to see her in a lascivious state overcame me, so I ignored her words and continued to watch.</p>
<p>&#12288;After a while, she seemed to have finished defecating as she expelled not only the liquid but also the lump.</p>
<p>&#12288;She must have been very embarrassed, because Sophie's face turned bright red. I could see her chrysanthemum buds, which were slightly open due to her defecation, twitching and moving.</p>
<p>&#12300;Uuhh, if you sees me like this, I'll have no choice but to ask Yard-sama to marry me off. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I poured hot water on her to clean her up and hugged her from behind. In the past, I would have covered her body, but now that I had seen her embarrassed once, she seems to have lost her sense of shame.</p>
<p>&#12300;Well then, Sophie, let's do it again. Because you can't get clean just once.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I gave her two additional enemas, but only clean liquid came out, so she was ready to go. Sophie's sense of shame had diminished considerably thanks to the many enemas she had received, and when I touched her chrysanthemum buds, she became shy but made a pleasant noise.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sophie, I think it's time.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Y-yes. Yard-sama, please. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Sophie gets down on all fours and raises her ass to me. I slowly insert one finger into her chrysanthemum bud. It was loose from the many enemas I had given her, and it easily swallowed my finger.</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahh, aaaaaaahhh ...... I can feel your finger coming in ...... Nnhh ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I can't believe it's so easy to put it in even though it's your first time... Sophie is surprisingly greedy here.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Nooo ...... please don't say that. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Her insides are hot and occasionally tighten around my fingers. I was impressed by the different feel than vagina, and when I tried to move my fingers around to see how she felt inside, she let out a pained cry.</p>
<p>&#12300;Y-Yard-sama ......Nnhh, don't stiiir it ...... Oh, Nnhhh......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Even with all that you said, though, Sophie's tightening up here.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I stirred around inside her with my fingers, she began to get used to it, and her gasps began to mix with her pained voice. She also seems to have quite a talent for anal, as she begins to move her hips a little more in time with the movements of my fingers.</p>
<p>&#12300;I think I might be able to get two in this one.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Eh, wait, please ......! Aahhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When I pulled my fingers out, she let out a wistful cry and shook her body. It seems that she has come lightly. It seems to be okay.</p>
<p>&#12288;She was breathing hard, and now I inserted two fingers into her. I inserted them with more force than before, but her chrysanthemum buds swallowed them both, though a little tightly.</p>
<p>&#12300;This is amazing,......, the pressure in my stomach,......!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;If you can feel this much even here, maybe it's time to put it in.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I tried to move my two fingers in and out a little harder, but instead of hurting her, she seemed to feel more pleasure. As I watched her sway her hips in time with my fingers, I began to lose my patience.</p>
<p>&#12300;It was time to make you come once. Here, how about this?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, no, something's coming! Aaahhhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I thrust my fingers in and out, stirring the inside of her as hard as I could. She arched her back and climaxed with a high-pitched scream. As she climaxed, her chrysanthemum buds closed and tightened around my finger.</p>
<p>&#12288;As she collapsed, I pulled my finger out of her and found a gaping hole. The way she twitches and moves like she wants something is indecent.</p>
<p>&#12288;I took her in my arms and sat her on top of me, facing me. As I placed my cock against her chrysanthemum bud, she looked at me expectantly.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sophie, I'll put it in.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes ......Nn, Nnnhhhhhhmmm!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I slowly lowered Sophie's hips, I could feel my cock going in and out of her. Even though it was her first time, it swallowed the cock to the root and she tightened up, letting out a hot breath.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sophie, it's so hot inside you. I'm glad you're feeling so good.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I-I'm also ...... glad to be one with Yard-sama. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She looked a little distressed, as if it was different from my fingers, so I didn't move and waited for her to calm down. As I did so, she extended her tongue. I responded to her tongue and she seemed to be happy.</p>
<p>&#12288;After a while, her breathing calms down and I start to move my hips a little. She seems to have become accustomed to the size of my cock, and her sweet breath begins to leak out as she twirls her tongue around mine.</p>

			<p>&#12288;As I gradually increased the speed at which I moved my hips, her breathing also became more and more ragged, and she began to moan with her mouth parted as she ran out of breath.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama's thing, Nnhh, it's going deep inside me, Aahh, Aahhn!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Sophie's insides are nice too, they tighten up on my thing, Kuhh&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The feeling was different from that of a vagina, but the tightness, especially around the entrance, and the intense movement inside made it feel good. She seemed to be experiencing a strong sense of pleasure from the tightening.</p>
<p>&#12288;Despite the fact that I was thrusting in and out of her uncontrollably and violently, she seemed to remember nothing but pleasure already. Her mouth was half open and she was moaning and moving her hips to get more pleasure from herself.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama! I-I can't do this anymore! Something's coming, Aaahhnnnn!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;All right, I'm about to come too!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahh, nooo! I-I'm cumminggg, aahhhhhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Kuhh, I'm coming!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As she climaxes, her insides tighten, and I can't hold back and I'm cumming inside her. She tightens up again as I ejaculate, as if she can feel the semen coming out of me. Her expression is debauched, with a luster that is different from her usual innocent impression.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I had finished pumping my load into her, I pulled out my cock and she leaned back against me. Her chrysanthemum buds were filled with the semen that I had just produced. It seemed that she was tired from all that had happened and fell asleep.</p>
<p>&#12288;Seeing her like this, I decided that I couldn't go any further, so I cleaned her off with hot water and left the bath. I asked Tia to help me change her clothes.</p>
<p>&#12288;After that, I sent her back to the castle with the &lt;<ruby>Advanced-Transfer<rt>Greater Teleportation</rt></ruby>&gt;. If I let her stay at the mansion, there would be a lot of problems.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;Despite such events, the three heroes gathered together the next day as usual.</p>
<p>&#12288;There was no more information than yesterday, so we immediately broke up. Rather than wasting time searching for more information, we were told to make various preparations for our departure.</p>
<p>&#12288;Since I had some free time, I went to Sophie's place to see how she was doing after that. Fortunately, she seemed to be free as well, and when I visited her room, she welcomed me with open arms.</p>
<p>&#12300;Thank you, Yard-sama, for yesterday. I don't know what would have happened if Thomas-sama had attacked me like that. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You'd better to forget what happened yesterday, and I'm not going to let this happen again.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She shuddered at her own words. Well, for her, his actions were such that she could only feel fear.</p>
<p>&#12288;After that, Thomas was seen by some people running through the castle completely naked, and he was punished for his act of disturbing the castle and insulting the Kingdom. The Count of Berkefield was demoted to Viscount, and he was banned from the castle.</p>
<p>&#12288;It seems that Viscount Berkefield was terrified of his deranged son and sent Thomas back to the provinces, claiming he was insane. He won't even be able to be the heir anymore after what happened.</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Yes, you're right. I'm going to pretend that last night was just a bad dream. Besides, after that, I was able to become one with Yard-sama.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She holds her cheeks and looks embarrassed, but she sounds more than happy to be talking. However, I tell her with a hand gesture not to speak any further as someone might overhear us.</p>
<p>&#12288;She also hurriedly keeps her mouth shut to make sure no one around us is listening. The people who had been bribed had already been fired and replaced by new servants. It's just yesterday that they were working so fast.</p>
<p>&#12300;Come to think of it, Yard-sama's mansion had quite a few magic tools in use. I wonder if you had the money to buy that many magic tools after you bought the mansion?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I didn't buy those. They were too expensive to buy, so I made them all myself.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You made them yourself, that's amazing!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Apparently, there are only a few people who can make magic tools, and there is only one other store in the capital besides the one I went to. The supply is completely insufficient to meet the demand, which is why the prices are so outrageous.</p>
<p>&#12288;In addition, the magic stone itself, which is the core of the magic tool, is also rare in the kingdom, and even if you try to buy a magic stone with a diameter of about two centimeters, it will cost enough money for a commoner to live and play for the rest of their life.</p>
<p>&#12288;There are a lot of magic stones of that size lying around in the laboratory of the mansion, but it seems that in this country, even such scrap magic stones can be worth a lot of money.</p>
<p>&#12300;Even so, but how did Yard-sama get hold of such a large amount of spirit stones?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, but that can only be taught to those who seek to understand the depths of magic.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see. ...... Ah, and don't steal, okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's okay. It's not like I'm messing with a mining site controlled by this country.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;In the first place, I don't know where in this country magic stones can be extracted. Even if I could, I would probably only be able to get a very small amount. Even in ordinary magic pools, there are very few naturally occurring magic stones.</p>
<p>&#12288;I used to use artificial magic stones in my original world. The natural products were a waste of money because they absorbed more magic and stored more magic power.</p>
<p>&#12300;And while we're on the subject of magic tools, there's something I'd like you to receive.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I took out a ring-shaped magic tool from my pocket and handed it to Sophie. Unfortunately, I don't have any materials such as gold or platinum, nor do I have any knowledge of art, so it's just a simple ring with a magic stone engraved on a silver base.</p>
<p>&#12288;Even so, it seemed to be surprising enough to her. She happily took the ring, put it on her hand and looked at it.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama, what is this ring?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;The ring is a magic tool that can activate Spell Cancelation and &lt;Poison Detection&gt; at all times. If you wear it, you can prevent a situation like yesterday. It's not the best looking ring, but if you wear it, you can ensure your safety to a certain extent.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Would it be alright for me to received such a great magic tool?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, if it can keep you safe, I can spare that level of magical tools.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, for my sake, ...... Yard-sama ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;And I've already given that magic tools to Tia and the others. I'm not going to tell her that, though, because it might upset her.</p>
<p>&#12288;If I go to Leshiana, I don't know when I'll be able to come back, so it's better to have this level of insurance. Since Thomas, the original culprit, is in that state, I don't think Sophie will be attacked anymore, but his father might attack someone in my mansion, you know.</p>
<p>&#12288;So tomorrow we'll finally leave for Leshiana. I'll have to be ready by the end of the day.</p>
