<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; The Duke's Plot, A Traitor's Trap</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>5.1</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;The journey back was uneventful and we reached the castle in three days, a day earlier than scheduled. When we entered the castle, we were called into the audience hall and given words of praise by the king. He said that we would be given a prize for our work this time.</p>
<p>&#12300;I have heard that the battle you fought the other day was truly magnificent. In recognition of this honor, I am sending you a medal of honor, and in the hope of furthering the development of our nation, I am bestowing the title of Baron on Alec Gilflea, and the title of Associate Baron on Sagami Ryohei and Yard Werner. As for Fairis-dono, the Church wishes to grant you the title of Coadjutor Bishop in the Eastern Henrient.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I was surprised by the sudden turn of events, but I managed to keep it from showing on my face. I didn't know how to react, so I'll do the same as Sagami. Then Alec stepped forward as a representative.</p>
<p>&#12300;We all vow to become His Majesty's subjects and to wield this sword for the good of our country and our people.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Fumu, I believe that with your strength, we will be able to overthrow the Demon Empire. I hope that you will continue to serve my kingdom.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The people around me applauded. Apparently, I can't refuse the reward. Well, there's no reason to refuse this time, so it can't be helped. And I don't know how much of a title a Assosiate Baron is, but it might be more useful in case of emergency.</p>
<p>&#12288;At that time, I suddenly felt a gaze and looked around to see someone staring at me. His features matched the image of the person Tia had told me about. <span style="font-style: italic;">I see, so that's Dian. He looks like a villain.</span></p>
<p>&#12288;I'm sure that according to his plan, the fortress would have been conquered by the Demon Empire, but our strength exceeded his expectations, so his plan fell apart.</p>
<p>&#12288;If I hadn't been among the heroes, I'm sure his plan would have succeeded. His only miscalculation was that this kingdom had me, a person with a higher spec than he expected. At best, he should regret his decision to pick a fight with me.</p>
			<p>&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12300;Yard-sama!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was leaving the audience hall to return to my room, Sophie came over to me. She didn't hug me because we're in public, but she wrapped her hands around my hands and looked at me with moist eyes.</p>
<p>&#12300;I was sure that you would come back safely.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, an enemy of that caliber wouldn't be able to defeat me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You don't have any plans after this, do you? If you don't mind, I'd like to have tea with you. What do you think?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'd love to, but I actually have a few things to do afterwards. ...... Would another day work for you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see, then, please come whenever it's convenient for you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I apologize to her, and we part ways. It's okay to go out with Sophie, but Tia is a higher priority than that. Elle has been sent to Fairis' room, so I hurry to my room to meet Tia alone.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, when I entered the room, there was no sign of her, but another maid was there instead. Her waist-length blond hair was tied in a single strand at the nape of her neck. Her breasts didn't even appear to bulge, a shame really. I don't know what it was called, but it was a cutting board?</p>
<p>&#12288;When she noticed me, she bowed to me.</p>
<p>&#12300;Nice to meet you, Baronet-sama. My name is Rosalie, and I've been assigned to you today.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I hadn't heard you were replacing the previous maid, but what happened to the previous one?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;The previous one was removed. I haven't heard what happened to her after that.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It's a strange story. It's conceivable that a maid could be replaced when a title is conferred, but even so, a word or two would be nice. In addition, I sensed something unfavorable about this maid, so I hurriedly sent a reminder to Tia.</p>
<p>(Tia, can you hear me?)</p>
<p>(Is this master?)</p>
<p>(Yeah, it's me, where are you now?)</p>
<p>(I think I'm in a dungeon somewhere now ....... The Duke has found out that the magic in the bracelet has been lifted, and all four of the former personels who failed to perform their duties are being punished.)</p>
<p>&#12288;What a mess, this is completely my fault. The other day's battle was a perfect opportunity for the duke's side to manipulate the heroes. I'm sure they found out that I had deactivated it at that time. I should have paid more attention to Tia.</p>
<p>&#12288;I want to get her out of there as soon as possible, but I also don't want this maid to see the magic.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, I need to wipe myself down, can you bring me some hot water?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Very well, please wait a moment.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The maid knew that I wipe my body every day, so she gave me a suspicious look and left the room to get some hot water.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I saw that she had left the room, I hurriedly began to draw the magic circle. I had to finish the job before the maid came back.</p>
<p>(You have the coins I gave you before, right?)</p>
<p>(Yes.....What should I do with this?)</p>
<p>(No, just hold on to it.)</p>
<p>&#12288;I searched for a reaction to the coins and found one outside the royal palace. Now that I knew where it was, all I had to do was call Tia. With tremendous pen speed, I drew up a magic circle and activated it.</p>
<p>&#12288;The Fourth Type of Time-Space Jump Magic, &lt;<ruby>Advanced Other-Transfer<rt>Greater Teleportation Others</rt></ruby>&gt;. It is a magic that allows a specific person or object to be transferred without error.</p>
<p>&#12288;As soon as I activated the magic, the magic circle glowed, and when the light subsided, there was Tia in her tattered clothes. She was stunned, seemingly unaware of what had happened.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I saw the scars on her beautiful skin, I felt anger towards the Duke. I feel like she've been touched by his dirty hands.</p>
<p>&#12288;No matter how much it was once his pawn, it was now mine. I need to make him understand what it means to injure my woman.</p>
<p>&#12288;But first, I have to heal Tia's body. I don't want to see her bleeding any more.</p>
<p>&#12288;I hugged her and touched her body. I use the &lt;Major Heal&gt; to heal the injured parts so that there are no scars left. When she realizes that I'm not a illusion, she puts her arms around me and hugs me, but when she sees herself, she rushes away from my arms and leaves me.</p>
<p>&#12300;I-I'm sorry. I've been in jail for a few days and I'm dirty, so if you hug me not, you'll get dirty too, Master. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't worry about that. I'm just glad you're okay.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Master......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She was moved to tears and I pulled her close and kissed her on the mouth. She puts her tongue in my mouth, and I respond by intertwining our tongues. It's been a long time since I've kissed her, and I can't help but want to finish her off, so I slowly pull my mouth away. The saliva trailing down out tongue was a very lewd sight.</p>
<p>&#12300;Tia, I've sent your substitute maid to get hot water, but she'll be back soon, so please hide somewhere.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;S-sure.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;But the only places to hide are the desk and under the bed, so I have no choice but to ask her to go under the bed.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;Shortly after she hid, the maid came back. It seemed to have been a pretty close timing..</p>
<p>&#12300;Baronet-sama, I've brought you some hot water.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, put it there. I'll take care of the rest myself.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, it's part of my job to wipe the Baronet-sama body.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's an order. I'll do it myself, and you can leave the room.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;But I am ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I distrusted the attitude of her, who for some reason persisted even when I told her it was an order, and invoked the &lt;Mind Steal&gt;.</p>
<p>(Taking off his clothes is a unique opportunity to cast a slavery spell. Master wants me to bring him there as soon as possible, so I can't miss this opportunity.)</p>
<p>&#12288;It's someone, or rather, it's definitely someone from Dian's side. But still, slave magic. It's a good thing that I had rigged the other heroes' bracelets. I had put a permanent spell cancellation on their bracelets just in case something like this happened. I don't want them to fall into the hands of the enemy here.</p>
<p>&#12288;This maid also seems to be very aggressive in trying to enslave me, even for a Duke's order, so I don't need to show any mercy. I'll let you do whatever you want.</p>
<p>&#12300;...... ...... If you're going to go that far, it can't be helped. I still think you should be the one to wipe me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, I understand.&#12301;</p>
<p>(All right, now I can cast a spell. I've got him now. He was a fool to defy my master, but be glad he's useful to him.)</p>
<p>&#12288;Her acting is meaningless as her thoughts are leaking out. I took off my clothes and turned my back to her, but it was obvious that she was pretending to wipe my body and secretly taking out her magic tools. After wiping my body to some extent, she put her arms around my neck and put on a bracelet, a magic tool, while strangling me.</p>
<p>&#12300;&#12302;Let the fetters of the gods bind and seize this man, and let this wretched being know the majesty of the Lord!&#12303;&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She chanted a troublesome incantation, and the magic went into effect. Instantly, a warning sound echoes in my head.</p>
<p>(&#12302;The first magical barrier has been penetrated. The second magic barrier has been penetrated. Third magic barrier successfully defended. The attack magic has been successfully traced. It's assumed to be a type 2 telepathy magic from close range. The enemy is still attacking and will counterattack. Search for counter-magic. Activate &lt;Hypnotic&gt;&#12303;)</p>
<p>&#12288;Her spell is blocked by my magic defense, and she receives the countermagic on the contrary. The effect of the magic causes her to lose consciousness and physical freedom, and she looks dazed.</p>
<p>&#12288;&lt;Hypnotic&gt; is a literal effect that can put an opponent into a hypnotic state. The effect is a completely degraded form of &lt;Dominate&gt;.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I saw that she had stopped moving, I put my clothes back on and took off the bracelet I was wearing. My arms had turned red because of the small size of the bracelet.</p>
<p>&#12300;You are going to listen to me now. Do you understand?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, sir.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Okay, when I clap my hands, you will return to your normal self. You will also remember that you've been hypnotized by me. But you can't disobey me, and you can't move a step from that spot. And when I clap my hands again, you will return to the hypnotic state.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, I understand.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I clap my hands, and life comes back to her eyes. I know she've been hypnotized by the &lt;Hypnotic&gt;, so I stared at her.</p>
<p>&#12300;!? W-Why are you in control?!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;There's no need to explain. Instead, I'd like to know more about why you attacked me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Because that's what Master ordered me to do. He said the situation got worse because you interfered with his plans.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Who's your master? Who is your master connected to?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's the Duke Dian. I don't know anything about master being connected to anyone.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I thought so, but it's still Dian. If I don't do something about this, Tia will be in more danger than me, as she'll be seen as a traitor.</p>
<p>&#12288;And then there's this woman. It seems that Dian didn't trust her as much as Tia, but I can't forgive her for being connected to him. What kind of retaliation should I give her?</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was wondering what to do, I heard a rustling sound coming from under the bed. When I called out to her, she crawled out from under the bed. The maid's face twisted in astonishment when she saw her, who was not supposed to be there.</p>
<p>&#12300;Why are you here? Aren't you in the middle of being punished ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahh, I was wondering if it might be Rosalie, but I guess it is Rosalie after all. Master, she works for the Duke Dian, and is my junior.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You betrayed the Duke! You should be ashamed of yourself!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... She had this cocky attitude towards her seniors, and I tried to fix her somehow, but in the end she's stayed like this. I think it would be better to have master discipline her here.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see. Is that what you want?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, sir.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I didn't expect Tia to come up with such a proposal. I wondered if she was really exasperated with her attitude. Oh well. I clap my hands and put her in a hypnotic state.</p>
<p>&#12300;You will continue to be rebellious with me until I tell you to stop. But every time you defy me, you'll be in heat and your body will aches, but you won't be able to climax or comfort yourself. You won't remember what you just said when you wake up.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, sir&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When I snapped my hands, she came back to herself and glared at me again. But it must have caused her to go into heat immediately, because she holds her crotch and distorts her face. Her face is blushing.</p>
<p>&#12300;What's the matter with you, holding your crotch? By any chance, did you feel it?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's none of your business. ......!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She couldn't stand any longer, and crouched down on the spot, holding her crotch. I wondered if she was vulnerable to pleasure after only two times. It was starting to get interesting.</p>
<p>&#12300;If you have any requests, I'll be happy to oblige.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I-I don't want to, Nnhh. ...... Who the hell wants you, !?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It felt really good to see her digging more and more graves. After all, this is how payback should be.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I looked at Tia, she was looking down at her without expression, but when she noticed my gaze, she shook her head. Apparently, it was not enough.</p>
<p>&#12288;I threw a few words at her, but all of them were met with defiance, and she seemed to have reached her limit, her eyes wide open and unable to close her mouth. The inside of her thighs were soaking wet and there was a small puddle of water on the floor.</p>
<p>&#12288;I thought it was about time, so I looked at Tia again, but she shook her head again. I've been feeling it for a while, but she's pretty devilish, too.</p>
<p>&#12300;What's wrong? I'll do whatever you ask now, you know? You're going to cast a slavery spell on me, aren't you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ah......Ahh......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;At last, she couldn't even reply. At this rate, her breathing will be in danger. I'm not going to kill her, so I'll leave it at that.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I turned around to check with Tia, she nodded as if she had no choice. Were you still not satisfied?.</p>
<p>&#12300;Okay, you can be honest now. But don't masturbate, okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As soon as I gave her permission, she jumped on me and pushed her crotch against mine. I guess she's at the end of her patience, but it's hard to believe that she's been so defiant.</p>
<p>&#12300;Please, put it in! I'm going crazy if you keep doing this!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You're right, my thing hasn't gotten hard yet. If you want me to put it in, you're going to have to serve me here first.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The moment she hears my words, she takes off my bottom, exposing my lower half. Then she kneels down in front of me on the bed and buries her face between my legs.</p>
<p>&#12300;Mmm, Nnuum... ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As if she really wanted my cock in her, she sucked it deep into her throat and licked it up from the base to the tip, wrapping it around her with her familiar tongue. She looks so young, but inside she's a real slut. My cock is getting hard from her service.</p>
<p>&#12300;Nnhh, Mmmhuhh, fuu....Nnuhh&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You're so obsessed. If you want to taste my cock so badly, I'll move it for you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When I said that, I moved my hips, and she sucked me hard, her tongue tangling with mine and her cheeks flushing. I can't help but think that she wants me to ejaculate as soon as I see her doing it with such enthusiasm. But I can't let it out yet.</p>
<p>&#12288;I grab her by the head and use her throat as a masturbator. Her face contorts in painfully, but I don't care. Saliva spills from the corner of her mouth, wetting her mouth and my cock.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I'm about to ejaculate, I pull my cock from her mouth and shoot straight into her face. Her face is sticky with semen, giving her a very indecent look.</p>
<p>&#12288;Before I can order her to do anything, she wipes the semen off her face and puts it in her mouth. After carefully swallowing, she opened her mouth to show me that she had swallowed it all. She's such a slut.</p>
<p>&#12300;You already came, so put this in me. ...... Please ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The other side hadn't cum yet, so she held her crotch while she licked and cleaned my thing, then rubbed her love juice-soaked pussy against my cock. I'm not deflated by coming once, so I'm okay with a series of rounds.</p>
<p>&#12288;I check on Tia, but she's still smiling as usual, indicating with her hand and tells me to continue. She seemed to be okay, too.</p>
<p>&#12300;Turn around, get on all fours and stick your ass out.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, yeah. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Rosalie obeys my words without hesitation. I'm sure she's so excited that she's forgotten how to be strong and defy my words.</p>
<p>&#12288;She was on all fours, and I placed my cok on her vaginal hole and slowly sank it in. That seemed to be enough to make her come lightly, and her vagina tightened up.</p>
<p>&#12288;She gives me a good response, so I put it in deep enough to reach her cervix. I'm going in slowly, but she's cumming every time I move a little.</p>
<p>&#12288;She's a small woman, so I can't fill her to the base with my rod. I push up against her cervix, savoring the feeling of her inside.</p>
<p>&#12300;How it is? Do you see how it's hitting the cervix now?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I-I know! Stop-, Aahh! Ahh, ahh, ahh, don't grind thereee!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Why is it that when you tell me to stop, you keep tightening your grip on my things?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's because it f-feels gooood, Nnuuhh! It's because it feels good! Fuaahhhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It;s really nice to make the woman who had defied me pant and moan. Every time I thrust deep into her, she moans and tightens her grip on my cock. Her body feels so good that I wonder if she's been trained to flirt with men. It's a shame about her breasts, though.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm going to put the last of it in deepest part. You want some of my semen, right?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Y-yes, please cum in my deepest part!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Now you're being honest, I'm about to cum!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I slammed my hips down on her and got to her base. I ejaculate into her womb, feeling the tip sink into her cervix.</p>
<p>&#12300;Aaaaaahhhh! I'm cuuuummiiing!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She seems to have cum at the same time as me. My semen pours into her vagina. Her climax continues, and her vagina moves in a jerky, rippling motion.</p>
<p>&#12288;I pull my cock out of her and she collapses. She seemed to have fainted. Well, she was on the edge to begin with.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was looking for something to wipe my stick wet with semen and love juice, Tia buried her face between my legs and cleaned it with her mouth. But she was still licking my supposedly clean stick. Apparently, she wants it too.</p>
<p>&#12300;Tia, do you want me to embrace you too?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, no, I'm still dirty. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;That's what I thought. But because I haven't seen her in a while, I honestly think I want to embrace her more than she wants to embraced by me.</p>
<p>&#12300;Then I'll wipe your body. Take off your clothes, please.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, Master.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;While she's undressing, I tie Rosalie up and roll her over so she can't move. I'll also gag her so she can't talk because she's in the way. Her body was adequate, but the fun was just beginning.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;It's my bad for telling Tia to take off her clothes, but the water I asked Rosalie to bring was cold, so I reheated it.</p>
<p>&#12288;She was wrapped up in a sheet on the bed, so she should be fine from the cold.</p>
<p>&#12288;When the water was at a good temperature, I called her over. I looked closely and saw that she still had a small scratch on her body, so I fixed it again with my &lt;Major Heal&gt; to make sure I didn't leave a single scratch. All that was left was to wipe it off.</p>
<p>&#12288;At first she tried to do it herself, but I managed to convince her to let me do it. I'm going to enjoy her body to the fullest.</p>
<p>&#12288;Let's start with the arms. Her arms were so thin that I was afraid they would break, but I could feel their softness. She looks like she has a lot of strength, so she should not be underestimated. I wipe her shoulders and neck. So far, she's just embarrassed.</p>
<p>&#12288;Next, I wipe her back. Her skin is perfect, not a single blemish, even though she can't see it from where she is. I slowly wipe it off, trying not to rub it.</p>
<p>&#12300;Hmm...... It feels so good, Master.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She says this to me, but I'm enjoying it as much as she is. When I wipe her armpits, she cowers a little, as if she's tickled, but I don't care, because my first priority is to get her clean.</p>
<p>&#12288;Now, the next thing I was looking forward to was her breasts. Her breasts are clearly larger than the average woman's breasts in this world, so it would be difficult not to clean them properly.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I touched her breasts, I felt a moderate elasticity. I wiped the upper hemisphere first, followed by the lower hemisphere as I lifted it. It was quite a weight on my hands. It seemed to be hard to hold her large breasts.</p>
<p>&#12288;I also wiped the cleavage of her breasts clean as sweat collected there. I could feel the pressure coming from both sides, and I could understand why men wanted to use this space.</p>
<p>&#12288;I wiped the tops of her breasts with just enough strength to rub them. Watching her body stiffen with each touch and the pleasure she was enduring made me want to play a few more tricks on her.</p>
<p>&#12288;The first thing I did was to check for leftover wipes. I took a closer look at her breasts and squeezed them to make sure they were still there. As I lifted and squeezed them in a supportive manner, I felt the softness envelop my fingers and even felt as if my hands were being buried.</p>
<p>&#12300;Master ......, what do you think of my skin?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hmm, very beautiful skin. But there's only one problem. Here.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hyah!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When I poke her nipple, she makes a lovely sound. I'm just wiping her off, but it makes her nipple stand up. This is a punishment. I pick her nipple and knead it.</p>
<p>&#12300;Fhuhhh... ...... Mmmm... ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Tia's frowns and she holds her mouth. I don't mind if she makes a sound.</p>
<p>&#12288;I want to make her scream, so I take her nipple in my mouth and roll it around with my tongue. I felt like I could still smell her sweet scent.</p>
<p>&#12300;Mmm, Master, there ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She seemed to be starting to feel the nipple as well, and her voice was laced with a glaze.</p>
<p>&#12288;Let's finish wiping the body first. It's not too late to have fun after that.</p>
<p>&#12288;I wiped her stomach and buttocks, then wiped her legs one at a time, carefully wiping between her fingers, and she reacted sensitively as I touched places that are rarely touched.</p>
<p>&#12288;Finally, I had to wipe her crotch. I wiped the slightly wet crotch clean and put the cloth back. If I wipe the inside with a cloth, it might scratch it. Tia seems to know what I'm doing and spreads it out herself. I could clearly see her vaginal cavity.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I lightly poked it with my tongue, which smelled like a female, I could see the vaginal opening tighten. I was amused by her reaction, so I repeated it a few times, and then Tia held my head down.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, M-Master. It's terrible that I'm rushing you ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;My bad. Your reaction was so funny that I got carried away.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Now I'm going to lick it all over. I could smell a little urine, but even that only stimulates my excitement now.</p>
<p>&#12288;I also put my tongue inside her vaginal hole and lick around inside. The vagina tightens around my tongue, but I don't care. My mouth became sticky as her love juices flowed more and more.</p>
<p>&#12288;I finished wiping herself off. She's already done, and my cock is hard even before I've finished wiping her body.</p>
<p>&#12300;Tia, I don't think I can hold back either. Can I embrace you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Sure, Master. If it's okay doing it with me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I couldn't stand the sight of Tia looking at me and smiling as she replied, so I jumped on her. I had already done the foreplay, so I suddenly inserted myself into her vagina hole.</p>
<p>&#12288;She's hot inside, and my cock tightens softly against her. I knew she was the best when I felt the exquisite tightness that seemed to match my shape.</p>
<p>&#12300;Ahh, Master's cock is in me!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's been a while since I embrace you, but you're still wonderful. You're as compatible with me as if you were made for me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm so happy to be used by you too, Master.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Tia was so happy that she hugged me. I hug her back and slam my hips against hers.</p>
<p>&#12300;Aah, nnhh, aahnn! It's good, nnhh, it's good!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I love it when I'm inside you! Please make me feel you more!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Y-yes! Ahhh, haahnn!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She was moaning, and I kissed her and covered her mouth. Our tongues intertwined, we licked every inch of each other's mouths, mixing our saliva together. She moves aggressively, and I move harder than usual in defeat.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, I guess I was no match for her charms after a long time, and even though it was only the second time, I immediately felt an ejaculation coming on. I tried to please her somehow, thrusting my hips hard and stirring her vagina, but I was finally reaching my limit.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm going to cum, Tia!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, just cum inside, Nnhh! Mmmmmmmmm!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I ejaculate while kissing her on the mouth. She climaxes at the same time as I do, and tightens her grip on me. She doesn't make a sound because her mouth is covered by mine, but instead she hugs me tightly.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I finish cumming inside her, I pull out my cock, and semen drips from her vagina.</p>
<p>&#12300;Haah, haaah, thank you very much, Master.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, it's me who should be thanking you, since I'm the one who invited you.&#12301;</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>5.2</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;I didn't do the third round. I was about to do exactly that when I noticed Rosalie wriggling on the floor.</p> <p>&#12288;She must have gotten up in the middle of our sex and was flailing around. She was in heat again, and the floor under her crotch was wet. I'm not impressed with the extra work it takes to clean it up.</p> <p>&#12288;For now, I unbind her and clap my hands to bring her back to the hypnotic state. The fact that she's still bouncing around in her hypnotic state shows that she's a slut.</p> <p>&#12300;Next time I clap my hands, you will return to your normal state. But you can't harm us, and if anyone tries to touch you, you have to defeat them. If you rebel against me, you'll still go into heat. Also, don't tell your master what happened here, but tell him he's an idiot.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, sir.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I clap my hands, and she's back to normal. There's no way to bring back her body, which goes into heat when she rebels, but she seems to be able to move for now. She adjusted her clothes and glared at me.</p> <p>&#12300;What is it? If you don't need me, can you please leave this room?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I don't need to be told to leave by you. .....!? Nnhhh!?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Rosalie, a maid shouldn't be verbally abusive to the people she serves.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;!!! My apologies, sir!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;She closed the door roughly and left. I can finally be alone with her now that the nagging noise is gone. When I turned to Tia, she had a troubled look on her face for some reason.</p> <p>&#12300;Is something wrong?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Were you okay to let Rosalie go? I think the Duke will come after the Master more and more if you let Rosalie go.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yeah, that's the point. The more attention he pays to me, the less harm he'll do to you. I've learned that his pawns are not going to be able to handle me.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;But that doesn't solve any of the problems. If you give the order, I will go and assassinate the Duke.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;That doesn't solve the problem either. He needs to go down with all the others involved. Besides, assassination is hardly revenge against the Duke.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Even if I kill Dian, I can't say that my safety is secured since there are other people who are connected to the Demon Empire. It's better to give him a social sanction in a situation where he can't escape, and let the others fall like a falling dominoes.</p> <p>&#12288;Perhaps if Rosalie told Dian what I said, he wouldn't send any more of his men. And after having his plans thwarted twice, he'll think that he has to deal with me first in order to get the other heroes. I'm going to take advantage of that.</p> <p>&#12300;I'll have you help me. He's going to make his move soon, so we need to take care of him as soon as possible.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Master has an idea, don't you?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;It's not much of a plan. And if it fails, we can just run away to another country.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;My reply didn't seem to be satisfactory, and she looked at me with a slightly troubled face. I told her that, but it didn't mean that the odds were against me.</p> <p>&#12288;What he would try to do to me would be either a direct assassination or a scheme to hang me as a criminal. Since the former can be done by force, the latter is what I need to deal with next.</p> <p>&#12288;The most likely scenario is that I'm suspected of being in league with the Demon Empire. I have a weakness called Elle. I'm sure the Duke has already heard of her, as she's a Dark Elf, a figure that instantly identifies her as a resident of an enemy country.</p> <p>&#12288;I've also told people that she's my apprentice, so she's the perfect person to claim a connection between me and the Demon Empire. She's also a former enemy soldier, which I'm sure he can find out with a little research.</p> <p>&#12288;Well, until he framed me for the crime, Elle's survival will be somewhat assured, so the rest is not my concern. I don't care if she's raped as long as she's alive.</p> <p>&#12288;But first, Tia's safety. I'm going to ask Sophia to help me here and hide her as well. If it's a request from me, I'm sure she'll accept it. I invoke telephatic and get her to agree to do me a favor and talk to me. While I was gone, I asked Tia to hide again and went to Sophie's room by myself.</p> 			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p> 			<p>&#12300;Welcome. I never thought I would be able to have tea with Yard-sama today.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;When I walked in, I found that tea had been prepared for me again, and I took a seat as I was told. When I spoke to her earlier, I told her that I had some business to attend to today, but it was foolish of me to ask her for a favor. But she didn't seem to mind.</p> <p>&#12288;She smiled at me and seemed genuinely happy to be able to talk to me, but unfortunately I had something to talk about before we could chat.</p> <p>&#12300;Sophie, as I reminded you earlier, I have a favor to ask of you today.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;If there is anything I can do, I will be happy to help. So, what kind of favor is it?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yeah, actually, there's someone I'd like you to secretly hide.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I told her about Tia, followed by the fact that she had escaped from Dian's place and was being chased, and that Dian was most likely connected to the Demon Empire.</p> <p>&#12288;She seemed quite surprised when she heard about Dian. Her impression of Dian was that he was an excellent nobleman who took part in national affairs seriously, except for the occasional strange glances he gave her. In particular, he has been cooperating in various ways with the war against the Demon Empire, and seems to be trusted by the king to the extent that he participates in strategy meetings.</p> <p>&#12288;It's as if he's a different person. But the source of my information is also solid. After all, the information came from the subordinate of the Duke's protégé. Sophie asked me to bring her to the room so that she could decide whether to believe my story or her own.</p> <p>&#12300;I'm sorry, it's not that I don't trust Yard-sama, but ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;No, it's a matter that could shake the kingdom if done poorly. It's better to be overly cautious. Then I'll call her right away.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Using the &lt;<ruby>Advanced Other-Transfer<rt>Greater Teleportation Other</rt></ruby>&gt; that I used earlier, I summoned Tia to this room. Sophie is surprised at her sudden appearance, but Tia, who seems to have gotten used to the transfer even though this is her second time, thanks me when she sees me.</p> <p>&#12300;Master, what can I do for you?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, I wanted to introduce you to Sophie. Sophie, this is Tia. She used to be my personal maid and is currently on the run from the Duke.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Good day to you, Your Royal Highness. My name is Tia, and I've just been introduced to you.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Y-yes. Nice to meet you, I'm Sophia Le Henrient, the first princess of the Kingdom of Henrient. You must be the Tia that Yard-sama was talking about.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Your Highness, please don't speak to someone like me in such a manner.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;No, if Yard-sama wants to help you even at the risk of his own life, I want to help him as much as I can. So don't be shy, also you can call me Sophie.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Tia, whose body had been tense at the thought of talking with Sophie, seemed to feel more comfortable, and gradually relaxed and started talking with her. If this is the case, I'll be fine even if I have to hide her.</p> <p>&#12288;As I was thinking this, she suddenly noticed something and approached Tia. I wondered if she was sniffing her scent, but her face instantly turned troubled.</p> <p>&#12300;I can smell Yard-sama from Tia-san. ...... What is the meaning of this? Could it be that the two of you are already in love with each other ......?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Sophie's unexpected words stopped me from thinking. It's not surprising that I couldn't get rid of the smell. But her nose is too good, how did she know it was mine?</p> <p>&#12288;I managed to come up with an excuse, but I couldn't think of one right away, so I asked Tia from her point of view. She frowned a little curiously, then nodded lightly as if she understood my intentions. Please, do something to cover it up.</p> <p>&#12300;Actually, my body was dirty, so I took off my clothes to wipe it off, but the hot water wasn't ready yet, so I was wrapped in Master's bed sheets until just now. I wondered if the smell came from that? I never intended to break the ice between Her Highness and Master.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Oh, i-is that so? ...... I'm sorry, I didn't mean to question the relationship between the two of you......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Sophie pulled away from her. <span style="font-style: italic;">You've managed to cover it up.</span></p> <p>&#12288;She's holding her reddened face in embarrassment, thinking that she misunderstood our relationship. I'm actually doing it, but if I tell her, she'll not only be in a bad mood, but she might not be able to hide her.</p> <p>&#12300;Sophie, I'm sorry to rush you, but could you please tell me your conclusion?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Oh, that's right. Tia-san, I'd like to ask you one question.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Sure, what is it?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;When Sophie turned to Tia, her mild-mannered atmosphere suddenly changed, and I felt a kind of dignity that was no less than that of Margarete. After all, she may look unreliable in general, but you can feel that she is royalty.</p> <p>&#12300;Can you swear to Yard-sama that you will never betray him, no matter what?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, I swear that I will never betray my master, even if it means the end of my life.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I see. Then I will believe in your words. I hope you can help Yard-sama.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;The tense atmosphere dissipated and Sophie returned to her usual gentle demeanor. Now Tia is safe, I have to go and get Elle next.</p> <p>&#12288;However, Sophie strongly suggested that we enjoy tea time together, so I had no choice but to go along with her. I had Tia do the serving.</p> <p>&#12288;A little extra time had passed, but I had to pick up Elle soon, so I left the room, leaving Sophie and Tia looking a little satisfied. Elle must have gone to Fairis' room.</p> <p>&#12288;On the way to Fairis's room, I saw Fairis coming from the other side, looking in some kind of hurry. She was alone, and of course there was no sign of Elle. When she spotted me, she hurriedly approached me.</p> <p>&#12300;Yard-sama, where have you been! You weren't in your room, so I had to look for you for a long time!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I'm sorry about that. So, since you're in such a hurry to find me, did something happen to Elle?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;T-that's right! Elmaire-san was in my room, but suddenly a group of knights came in and took Elmaïre-san away, saying that she was an informant of the Demon Empire! I stopped them, thinking it was some kind of mistake, but they didn't seem to listen to me. ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I understand what happened, but it's not a problem. A little early, but we're on schedule.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;On schedule? What do you mean, "on schedule"?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Fairis is twisting her head as if she doesn't understand a word I'm saying. I guess she wants to find Elle and prove her innocent, but she has to wait a little longer.</p> <p>&#12300;She's been captured to ensure our safety, to remove the corruption in this country. It is our duty to repay her for that.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;So you're saying that Elmaïre-san had to get caught herself to protect us from something?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;That's generally the correct interpretation.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;The difference is that Elle herself has no such thoughts at all, she's just a victim, but there's no need to tell her that. But for now, it's about turning the tables on the Duke, and mock the Duke as he is knocked from his peak to the bottom.</p> <p>&#12288;Fairis saw me grin uncontrollably and bend my mouth into a smile. Her gaze was very cold at that time.</p> 			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p> 			<p>&#12288;I was summoned by the king, so I entered the room I had visited during my audience, remembering the time when I was called to this world.</p> <p>&#12288;The situation is very different from the last time I was here, but the biggest difference is that my hands are shackled and I'm surrounded by armed knights. It was only a short while ago that a knight came into my room and brought me here in shackles. Apparently, I was brought here as a sinner.</p> <p>&#12300;Now, Duke Dian, tell me the charges against him. What crimes are you going to try him for?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;The king is sitting on the throne in front of me, and the Duke is diagonally in front of me. In this situation, without a defense attorney, all I can do is listen the evidence against me. The fact that he was giving the Duke a quizzical look indicated that the King was still unaware of the situation. If you're not in league with the duke, fine.</p> <p>&#12288;After the king's words, Dian stepped forward. He turned his head toward us and smiled wickedly.</p> <p>&#12300;Then I will say this. This time, the guilty man, Yard Werner, has been charged with betraying the King's trust, and unexpectedly connecting with the Dahlo Demon Empire to pass on information about us.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Dian's statement caused a groan from the surrounding people. I wasn't surprised, as I had expected it to happen, but the king didn't seem surprised either. I had expected him to react in the same way as the people around him, but how should I view this reaction?</p> <p>&#12300;Fumu, Associate Baron Werner, is this true?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I think it's a funny joke that I'm a secret agent, but I don't remember doing anything to abandon His Majesty the King or Her Highness the First Princess. If there is any suspicion that I have betrayed this country, it is probably made up by the Duke, without even thinking about it.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Wha!? You have no right to speak to His Majesty like that!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I think I'm speaking normally. You can complain to the person who set up the translation magic. I don't use these words because I like them.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Dian's face turned red with anger. <span style="font-style: italic;">Haha, you're like an octopus.</span></p> <p>&#12288;The other nobles seem to have generally the same reaction. It's not that I'm rude or anything, it's just that the magic that came with the summoning of the heroes, which translates our language so that it can be understood by the people of this world, has been activated, so it sounds like this tone of voice. It's not that I'm speaking the language of this country.</p> <p>&#12288;It seems that words like honorifics have been translated according to the standards of this world, but the language I use expresses respect in context, so there are no words that directly show respect. This is probably the reason why the tone of voice of the heroes other than Fairis sounds rather rude.</p> <p>&#12300;So you are saying that you are innocent of this matter?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;That's right. I don't have any confidential information to leak, and even if I did, I wouldn't go to the trouble of sharing it with the Demon Empire. In the first place, why should I cooperate with a country I've never even been to?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;What nonsense, I have someone who can prove that you've been in contact with the Demon Empire! Hey, bring her in!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;The one who opened the door and came in was Elle, who was bound and gagged on both arms. For some reason, she was not dressed in the clothes she wore before she was captured, but in a tattered loincloth. It seems that something has been done to her, but she is not under any kind of brainwashing, which is good.</p> <p>&#12288;When she spotted me, her pale face blushed slightly. She must have been a little relieved to find someone she knew. But the soldiers dragged her past me and carried her to Dian.</p> <p>&#12300;Your Majesty, this woman is the proof. I've heard that the Associate-baron calls himself the master of this one. She used to be a wizard in a Demon Empire, and was rescued by the Associate-baron when she was beaten back by the heroes. He has been carrying her around like this since then, but carrying enemy soldiers around in fortresses and royal palaces, isn't that the deed of a traitor!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I've already told you that she's lost her memory. Besides, if I were a spy, I think it would be better to hide her somewhere out of sight instead of carrying her around in the open, so that she won't be suspected.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;It's useless to try to deceive us like that, where is the guarantee that this person's memory is really gone. If she says she doesn't remember, it's probably just an excuse she's given in desperation. Besides, the memory might come back someday. How can I know the future if I'm not a god?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Elle is desperately shaking her head in denial, but Dian is deliberately ignoring her. Well, that's what you usually do. It's natural to pick up only the parts that are convenient for you, such as the testimony of people from enemy countries.</p> <p>&#12288;The king didn't seem to enter into our conversation and seemed to be planning to listen to the whole thing in silence. He seems to be ignoring Elle, but even though her memory is gone, she is still an enemy of the country that killed his people.</p> <p>&#12300;I'm sure her memory won't return. Her memories have been extracted and sealed in a certain orb by my magic. And even if I use that orb, her lost memories will not be restored, they will only be lost forever.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;What!? Where is the orb!?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I'm sure it was in my luggage, but didn't you check it?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Kkuhh! Oi, you guys, get all the stuff from this guy's room!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;On Dian's orders, the soldiers brought a bag of stuff from my room. When I turned the bag over to reveal its contents, I found souvenirs that I had bought on my way back from the fortress, as well as magical catalysts that I had collected while in the fortress.</p> <p>&#12288;Most of it was good, because even if they saw it, they wouldn't know what it was for, but when they saw the last bracelet, some of them were in a panic.</p> <p>&#12300;This is the bracelet of slavery! Where did you get something like this!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Dian took the bracelet and held it up for all to see. I remembered that after Rosalie wore it, I put a spell in it to break it and put another spell on it. It's no longer a bracelet of slavery, but I wonder if all the magic tools in this world are even the same shape.</p> <p>&#12300;Your Majesty, the Associate-baron must have been plotting something with these bracelets! Using forbidden subjugation magic is not something that people of any country would do. Isn't this proof that this person is connected to the Demon Empire?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;The king thought about Dian's words for a moment and let out a sigh. He is probably thinking that this is too much. There is no way that I, a newcomer to this world, can easily acquire a forbidden magical tool.</p> <p>&#12300;Associate Baron Werner, the Duke is correct in stating that these bracelets are forbidden to be made or used in the kingdom. Where in the world did you get this?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;If you examine the bracelet in detail, you will find that it is not the same as the bracelet of slavery. It's a bracelet that has a spell that cancels out physical and mental changes, curses, paralysis, sleep, and other abnormalities caused by the effects of magic.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;What nonsense, the engraving on this magic tool is indeed slave magic. Besides, it's not that easy to make a magic tool.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I didn't say it was a magic tool. I just removes the original magic and gives it a spell cancelation that lasts for a while. This is not a magic tool, so the effect can be removed with a magic-eliminating dispel. I've already removed the magic resistance, so you can try it out.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;After much hesitation, Dian summoned the magician. When the magician cast the magic dispel, the magic on the bracelet dissipated and no more magic could be felt from it. The effect seemed to have disappeared completely.</p> <p>&#12288;In the case of a magic tool, even if it is subjected to a magic elimination dispel, its function is only suspended, but the magic itself does not disappear, so it is clear that this tool is no longer functioning as a magic tool.</p> <p>&#12288;The magician seemed to understand this, and when he looked at Dian, he shook his head. Dian looked at the bracelet as if he was looking at something unbelievable. If it was really under slave magic, I wouldn't have carelessly shoved it into a bag, and I wouldn't have told him to go get the luggage bag that contained it.</p> 			<p>&#12300;...... I see. If this is no longer a slavery bracelet, where the hell did you get this? It seems to have disappeared now, but I'm pretty sure it was slavery magic that was on it originally.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;If I'm being honest, I'll tell you who it was that came after me. I confirmed that before I left for the fortress, the other heroes were also wearing the same bracelets, so I gave all of them the same treatment. I didn't know who sent it, so I didn't tell His Majesty the King in order to keep the culprit in the dark, but I apologize for that.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;The king frowned a little at my response. Even before we went to the fortress, the heroes had the bracelet. In other words, if I am a spy, then the person who gave us the bracelet is in this royal palace.</p> <p>&#12288;Dian clucked his tongue in frustration, then picked up the orb he had originally intended to use.</p> <p>&#12300;This is the one you were talking about earlier, correct?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;That's right. It contains her lost memories.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Dian took the orb in his hand and looked inside, shaking it. In order to see the memories, you have to use a magic, but it's interesting, so I keeps quiet. After a while, he gave up and came to me. He had tried everything, but all had ended in failure.</p> <p>&#12300;How does this orb allow us to see the memories inside?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I use a special magic. However, it's not something that the magician there can use. If there's a memory you want to see, I'll take it out, but what should you do?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;There's a chance you'll use a magic that hides the truth and shows false information.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Let the magician there see through that. Even if I don't do such a foolish thing, it won't change the fact that I'm innocent.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Hmph! Then give me a memory that shows that the orb belongs to the dark elf there.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Then let's use the memory of the last time she fought the heroes.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I'll activate the ejector and send the information inside directly to the king and Dian. Since the memory will be erased once it's been used, it doesn't already contain information about the Demon Empire's army.</p> <p>&#12288;The memories I showed them were her memories from the time she left the country until she met the heroes and was defeated by them. Of course, it would be impossible for her and I to meet before this in terms of time. The king looked at me and nodded, as if he was satisfied with the information. Dian also glared at me in frustration, but it seemed that there was no room for rebuttal.</p> <p>&#12300;Does this make you understand that this memory belongs to her? I'm sure Her Highness, the Second Princess, would agree that there has been no contact between me and the Imperial Army since she lost her memory. It was just a coincidence that I protected her.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Fumu, it seems that you're right. There's not much evidence to suggest that you're a spy.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;The king agrees with my statement, saying that my suspicions have been confirmed. Dian, however, doesn't seem to have given up yet. He's ordering his soldiers to bring something to me.</p> <p>&#12300;Even if she can't remember, she could at least mediate a letter. I heard that in the fortress, you were training in magic in a room for two. Isn't it as simple as pretending to be your apprentice, walking around, writing down information about the fortress, and passing it to the imperial soldiers without the others knowing?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;What are you trying to say?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Dian held out some kind of writing to me. I could tell from the handwriting on it that it was written by Elle. <span style="font-style: italic;">I see, so the reason he was keeping Elle locked up was to make up evidence in case of emergency.</span></p> <p>&#12300;Look at this. This is the document that she had hidden. I've already confirmed that it's not the script of the Kingdom, and it's not a military code. It was written in the code of the Demon Empire, so I couldn't grasp the exact contents, but I know that it contains information about the military equipment in the fortress. This letter proves that she is a secret agent. Of course, whoever brought in such a person would be just as guilty.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Why should we assume that it was written by her?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Because I did a handwriting analysis. It definitely had the same handwriting habits, no doubt about it.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;..............Ku&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;What's the matter? Are you finally ready to tell the truth?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Kuh, HAHAHAHAHAHA! Y-You think that paper is evidence!?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;It was so dumb that I couldn't hold back my laughter. Dian, who was looking at my sudden outburst of laughter in amazement, realized that he was being mocked and turned red and came at me.</p> <p>&#12300;What's so funny! This document proves that you were the one who guided her!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Duke, I know you want to incriminate me, but it was too stupid of a move to produce that document.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;What the hell! Don't you dare say anything to try to get away with this!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;It's really ridiculous, but if you insist, I'll tell you. She can't speak the language of the Empire, nor can she write the letters of the Empire. That includes codes, of course.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Wha! What are you basing that on!?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Try asking her. You may not understand, since she has probably never spoken here before, but the language she is speaking with us is Elvish. Apparently there are no letters in Elvish, so how can she write a code?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;This is the reason why she did not talk to anyone but the heroes. She didn't want to talk to anyone else by any means, so I forced her to listen. In short, she didn't understand what the people of the kingdom were saying, so she was too scared to approach them.</p> <p>&#12288;When the heroes was summoned, they were able to understand the language spoken by the other people and translate their own language into the language spoken by the other people, so they could speak. However, the other humans cannot speak Elvish, so for her, it is as if she is suddenly in a foreign country where she does not understand the language.</p> <p>&#12288;After her memory was drained, she didn't have the chance to meet the elves, nor did she have the time to learn the language of the kingdom, which is why she stayed close to me and Fairis, with whom she could converse.</p> <p>&#12300;But I know that this is a document written by that one! Even if it's not in Kingdom, Elven, or Imperial, how do we prove that it's not a code!?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;That's easy, enough. It is indeed her handwriting on the paper, but the paper is not a classified document, but a kind of magic circle composed of letters. It's a kind of magic circle made up of letters. All of the letters have some useless parts due to their poor composition, but if you channel magic power into it, it will be activated.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Wha!?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Dian is staring at the letter, but I don't think he can read those words. If he was a knowledgeable magician, he might have been able to determine what the formula was, but he didn't seem to have that kind of talent in his hand.</p> <p>&#12300;It's a strange story. How did you know what was written on this paper? The words on this paper are written in my world's script, and so far the only people who know those words are me and her. Even if the handwriting analysis shows that she wrote it, shouldn't the content be unknown?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;That's what the code-breakers have found out! They reported that it was about the fortress!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I'll give you one piece of advice, the magic on this paper is a magic that allows you to record and replay your memories and surroundings when you are writing this. I think this will help us to understand the situation when she wrote this magic circle, are you sure you want to activate it?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;T-That's ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Dian's knees buckled as if he had given up. When someone activated the magic circle, a three-dimensional image of her and some people surrounding her appeared in what seemed to be a basement room, writing this magic circle. Naturally, Dian was among them.</p> <p>&#12288;Now there was no excuse. The king seemed to have realized Dian's scheme when he saw the image and his gaze turned stern.</p> <p>&#12288;However, the revenge that he tried to take against me won't end at this level.</p> <p>&#12300;Duke Dian, you have framed Associate Baron Werner, a hero and a benefactor of our country, for a crime he did not commit and tried to frame him as a traitor. You know that this is an affront to my country, don't you?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;No, Your Majesty, I did it for the good of this country. I wanted to bring to justice those usurpers and plunderers who make disciples of the enemy soldiers, seduce Her Highness the First Princess, and eventually try to take over this country. I was not trying to deceive you, Your Majesty!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;As I listened to Dian's story, I contacted Sophie by telephatic. I think it's about time she arrived.</p> 			<p>(Sophie, did you find what you were looking for?)</p> <p>(Yes, I'm back at the castle now, so please wait a little longer. What's the situation over there?)</p> <p>(Oh, the Duke is in the middle of making desperate excuses.)</p> <p>(I see, I'll hurry then.)</p> 			<p>&#12288;When I cut the telephatic, Dian was still making excuses to the king. As I approached them, they finally seemed to notice me and both turned to look at me.</p> <p>&#12300;What's the matter? Oh, if it's the manacles, I'll take them off right away. Hey, take off the shackles of Associate-Baron Werner. His innocence is clear.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Thank you, Your Majesty, but I've been secretly trying to find out the real reason why Duke Dian did what he did. I was wondering if you would be so kind as to listening to me?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;You're talking out of your ass!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Is that true? All right, tell me.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;The reason he wanted to frame me was because I was a hindrance to the Duke's plan.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Houh, what was his plan?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;It's a plan to communicate with the Demon Empire and hand over the heroes to the Demon Empire. In return, the Duke was promised a position in the Demon Empire.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;No, that's not true! His Majesty the King, don't believe a word he says!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Duke Dian, be silent for a moment.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;The king had already lost interest in him, though Dian was desperately trying to hold on.</p> <p>&#12288;Just then, the door of the room opened at the right moment and Sophie and the others came in.</p> <p>&#12300;Oooh, Sophia. What's going on?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;We've brought the evidence of the Duke's misdeeds and the person who knows that the Duke tried to cast a slavery spell on the heroes.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;She said this and indicated with her hand Tia who was following behind her. Her head was still bowed in front of the king, but her body was trembling slightly, indicating that she was nervous.</p> <p>&#12300;So you are the witness Sophia is referring to. Raise your face.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Ha!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Father, let me introduce you. Her name is Tia, and she was undercover as one of Duke Dian's pawns at my order, investigating the Duke on her own. It was through her information that I discovered the location of the evidence.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I see. You're Tia, aren't you? Thank you for the valuable information.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;What a waste of words, it's my duty to serve my country!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;From the letter that Sophie had brought with her that described his correspondence with the Demon Empire, Tia's testimony and the slave bracelet, it was clear that the Duke was the culprit.</p> <p>&#12288;He was trembling with his hands on the ground. He probably didn't expect to be tricked by the very person he was trying to trap. On the king's orders, the soldiers took the Duke away.</p> <p>&#12288;After this, thanks to the Duke's desperation and vomiting out his accomplices, it was discovered that there were three other knighthood holders involved, and they were all stripped of their titles and punished.</p> <p>&#12288;All of the Duke's protégés were also secretly punished in some way, so Tia was the only one involved in this incident who had not been caught. I heard that Rosalie was handled by her, but I don't know the details.</p> <p>&#12288;But now there's no one left who's been targeting me. I guess I'm safer now than I was when I first came to this world.</p> <p>&#12288;I was more or less satisfied and had no intention of doing anything more to the Duke, but Sophie and Tia, who had helped me, seemed unhappy, as if they hadn't had enough revenge. I'll have to ponder again how to get them in a good mood.</p>
