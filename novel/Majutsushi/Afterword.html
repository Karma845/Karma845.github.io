<h3>Afterword</h3>

			<p>&#12288;First-time reader, nice to meet you. My name is Mochi, and I'm the author of this book.</p>
<p>&#12288;If you've been reading this book since the web version, thank you.</p>
<p>&#12288;Whether you are a new reader or not, thank you very much for taking the time to read this book.</p>
<p>&#12288;I started writing this novel when I was still a beginner at Nocturne, and I never dreamed that I would be able to publish it in book form. No, I did dream about it for a while. I'm sorry.</p>
<p>&#12288;In addition to the additions and corrections, there is a new sex scene between Lucia and Elaine for those who have already read the web version to enjoy. As a bonus, I've also added a list of magic that appeared in the main story. Please enjoy it along with the main story.</p>
<p>&#12288;I would like to thank the person in charge for inviting me to work on the book, and for allowing me to work on this work.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'd like to thank Ms. 218 for the wonderfully cute illustrations that gave color and shape to this story. As an author who secretly loves elves, I was very moved when I saw Elaine's design. I can't thank you enough.</p>
<p>&#12288;And to everyone who has supported me since the web version. It's no exaggeration to say that it's thanks to all of you that this work was able to be published. I just want to thank you. And if you don't mind, I'd appreciate your continued support.</p>
<p>&#12288;Thank you very much for reading this far.</p>
