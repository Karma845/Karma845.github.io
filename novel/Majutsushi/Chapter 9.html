<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; The Lost Forest, Uninvited Guests</h3>

ï¸Ž<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>9.1</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;For the three days between defeating the bandits and arriving at the great forest area of Leshiana, I felt very uncomfortable while spending the endless road in the narrow carriage. There were seven of us in the carriage, four of whom were related to me, so we occupied more than half of the small space.</p>
<p>&#12288;In addition, Natalia was wary of anyone who wasn't me, Elle was glaring at Natalia as she approached me, Lucia was hiding behind me as the other than three heroes looked at her coldly, and the bleak human relations were making the atmosphere in the carriage worse.</p>
<p>&#12288;At one point, I even thought about taking refuge next to coachman.</p>
<p>&#12300;Speaking of which, what are you going to do after you arrive in Leshiana?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't know. No one has ever come out before, so we'll just have to deal with it on the spot.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Even though you're an emissary of the country, that's very appropriate. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When Elle muttered with a sigh, which seemed to bother the other humans, especially Alec. He showed a frustrated expression. Please think about the occasion when you say things like that.</p>
<p>&#12288;I've already seen Natalia, the Wood Elf, so I'd say I've accomplished half of my goal, but Alec is really trying to carry out the king's orders.</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm also interested in seeing the High Elves, so I'm in favor of going to Leshiana. It would be interesting to find out why they call themselves elves but live so short lives.</p>
<p>&#12288;In addition to that, I would like to take a look at the magic pools, which must be quite large, since all the surrounding veins are gathered in Leshiana. It must have something to do with the High Elves.</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't think humans are welcomed in Leshiana, but don't be offended, okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Natalia doesn't seem to feel the bleakness of the carriage, but she's smiling to herself and clinging at me. Because of the thin fabric of her clothes, I can feel her breasts very well. Thanks to this, Elle's mood is worsening.</p>
<p>&#12300;I've heard rumors that humans are killed, but I wonder if that's actually true.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;People who enter without permission will be killed, but if you enter through the proper entrance, you won't be killed. The only thing is that there are no lodgings like in human towns, so please be careful about that. If you don't want to stay out in the open, you can always stay at my house.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Natalia suggested to me in a happy voice. However, if I stay at her house alone, she will surely attack me. I'd like to include Elle at least, but if she's in a bad mood and causes a problem, it will interfere with the mission.</p>
<p>&#12300; .......I'll think about it&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, you're welcomed.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;A married woman shouldn't lightly ask out a man when her husband might still be alive. I thought inwardly.</p>
<p>&#12288;Because I was left her the dark yesterday, she's been clinging to me. What would she do if I really had to stay in her room?</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;We stopped the carriage before Leshiana. No carriages were allowed from here, so we had to continue on foot. The coachman said he would be waiting for us in a nearby town.</p>
<p>&#12288;As we watched the carriage leave, we started to go into Leshiana, but Natalia grabbed my hands and stopped us.</p>
<p>&#12300;Wait, you can't go in there, they'll attack you. The entrance is this way, come on, follow me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I followed Natalia's lead and after a while she stopped. It seemed that this was the entrance, but there was nothing of the sort.</p>
<p>&#12300;This is the entrance. I'll take you to the village where I live first, and you can follow me. Don't stray from the path, okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Even though I was told that this was the entrance, I couldn't understand how it was different from the previous place. I thought Sagami might be able to help me with this, so I looked over at him, but he was shaking his head. The other people reacted the same way.</p>
<p>&#12288;Not caring about our confusion, Natalia walked into the forest, followed by Elle. We hurried after her, trying not to lose sight of her, but the lack of a path made walking difficult at best. The elves were moving along as if they were walking on a normal road, but I was barely able to keep up with them.</p>
<p>&#12300;Master, are you okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm not okay. How can you walk in such place without hesitation......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Even if you ask me why, ...... elves can walk normally even if the foothold is a bit bad.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What an enviable ability. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I look at Elle, who has stepped back and is walking alongside me at my pace, I feel a little annoyed at her nonchalance. Elves are probably too useful for many things.</p>
<p>&#12288;I looked behind me and saw that Lucia was lagging far behind. For a young lady who grew up in the city, it was tough to get a good foothold in the forest. I knew that if she kept going like this, she would collapse before we reached our destination, so I went to her side.</p>
<p>&#12300;It must be pretty hard for you, are you going to be okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Y-yes ...... I'm fine ...... *pant*, *pant* ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She doesn't look okay by any means, but I can't just let her leave here. She still has a lot of value.</p>
<p>&#12288;I have no choice but to carry her on my back. No matter how light she is, the weight of a human being is still a lot to bear. Dripping with sweat, I managed to make my way forward with desperation.</p>
<p>&#12288;We continued at a fast pace through the forest, and after a while we came to a place where the forest opened up a bit. This seemed to be a village. There were several huts made of wood, and we could see some elves.</p>
<p>&#12288;When the elves saw us appear, they showed their caution. They didn't attack us out of the blue, but they glared at us as if they hated us. The atmosphere was unapproachable.</p>
<p>&#12288;Amidst the subtle tension, Natalia ran towards them. The elves were surprised by the unexpected appearance of the person, but they immediately welcomed her with shouts of joy.</p>
<p>&#12300;Everyone, I'm home!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Natalia! Thank God, you're safe!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What happened to the others?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't know. There was no one left where I was being held. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see. ...... Speaking of which, what happened to Levin?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't know that either. He might have been sold, or he might be dead. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The elves are exchanging a lot of information. From what I can gather, Natalia, her husband Levin, and a few other elves were part of a trading party when they were attacked by Adriana and her men and were all captured.</p>
<p>&#12288;Because of this, it seems that hostility towards humans has increased, and trading has now been suspended. They didn't immediately kill us when we came through the entrance, but some elves were following us when we entered the forest so that they could kill us at any time.</p>
<p>&#12288;I hadn't noticed the guards at all, but if they could move so lightly in the forest, I guess they could easily act covertly. I'll be a little more vigilant.</p>
<p>&#12288;The elves seemed to have finished their talk, and some of them approached us. I'd like to think that the fact that they all have their weapons at the ready is just a precaution in case of emergency.</p>
<p>&#12288;Alec and Sagami also had their hands on their weapons in case of emergency.</p>
<p>&#12300;Wait, those humans carried me all the way here. And that sorceress is the one who saved my life by defeating Adriana. They are not here to harm us.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Hearing Natalia's words, the elves lowered their weapons. They were still wary of us, but they seemed to be listening to us.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, I haven't greeted you yet. I am Alec Roy Gilfreyer, Baron of the Kingdom of the Henrient. The men behind me are my companions. We have come to Leshiana to form an alliance with the elves who live here.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;An alliance between humans and us? I would advise you not to dream so foolishly.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Alec's expression tensed at the elf's remark. <span style="font-style: italic;">I think you're a little too quick-tempered. You're in an unwelcome position to begin with, so you should just let what they just said slide.</span></p>
<p>&#12300;In order to win agains the Demon Empire, I will make even the dreamiest of stories come true. I would like to speak with the ruler of this forest, can you show me around?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You've come on your own, and you can find them on your own. Just don't cause any trouble here&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The elves refused Alec's request and moved away. Apparently, it hadn't turned into a fight, but the elves here definitely didn't like us.</p>
<p>&#12288;Alec put his hand on the hilt of his sword, making a clinking sound. Let's just hope he didn't cut them.</p>
<p>&#12288;As the elves left, I tried to use my &lt;Memory Reading&gt;, but to my surprise, none of them knew where the high elves were. I had memorized the locations of the other settlements, so I had no choice but to search randomly for elves who knew where they were.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;The sun was about to set and we needed to find a place to sleep, but there were no elves willing to let us stay. I heard that it gets quite cold at night in this forest, so I ended up negotiating with Natalia to let us stay here.</p>
<p>&#12300;There is only one bedroom for me to use, but I think I can sleep two people in the living room and one in the kitchen. The rest is storage. If you don't like it, you can stay out here.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Then how about this, me, Sagami-dono, and Yard-dono use the living room and kitchen, and the others use the storage room?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What kind of nonsense are you talking? If you're a man, be a man and stay in the storage room. Leave the house to the girls.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Unreasonable ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, Alec-dono. I think it's the act of a gentleman to give this place to the ladies. Besides, it's nice to have a place to sleep.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;In the end, it was decided that the maid and Elle would take the living room, Lucia the kitchen, and the rest in storage room. Alec looked unconvinced, but Sagami seemed to be fine with the storage room.</p>
<p>&#12288;Dinner was served by Natalia. However, the food was tasteless, probably because very little seasoning was used. We ate the food as if we were gnawing on raw vegetables and headed for the storage room.</p>
<p>&#12288;Even though it was a storage room, the door could be closed, so the cold was quite mitigated. However, there were no blankets. We had to lay out straw and sleep wrapped in straw, which made Alec's mood worse than ever.</p>
<p>&#12288;I guess Sagami is used to this kind of situation, and he is making a bed out of straw. After all, soldiers are smart like this.</p>
<p>&#12288;Just as I was about to make my own bed, Natalia called out to me.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard, you're not sleeping over here, okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hmm? What do you mean?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What do you mean? ...... Well, come here for a second.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, I'm fine here.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;This is my house, okay? Just follow me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I decided that she wouldn't back down if I tried to be stubborn here, so I quietly followed her into the house. The women had been provided with a blanket, so they seemed to be a few degrees warmer than the storage room.</p>
<p>&#12288;I crossed their room and entered the bedroom. There was no other place to sleep inside, just a single bed. She closed the door and her cheeks were already flushed with excitement. She put her hand on my chest and gently leaned down.</p>
<p>&#12300;Fufu, if you've come this far, I can expect it right ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, you're the one who asked me to follow you, aren't you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm in the mood to take her up on her offer here, but I feel that if I do it with her now, it will reflect badly on Elle and the two heroes. Especially Elle seems to be no good. she was in a very bad mood even when I was stuck with her in the carriage, and I don't know what would happen if I did it with Natalia.</p>
<p>&#12288;Besides, it would be better not to be unfaithful until we knew whether her husband was alive or dead. Human resentment is a terrible thing. Unfortunately, she's not worth the risk of being stabbed at any moment.</p>
<p>&#12288;Well, those two things are just preliminaries. To tell the truth, it is troublesome to hold a woman who is persistent like Natalia. I'd rather have a woman who I can hold without hesitation. Woman of her type is annoying because she acts like a wife once she is in your arms.</p>
<p>&#12300;You have a husband, don't you? And you're only asking me out because of your temporary feelings.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't say that, just hold me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, but I didn't come here just for fun either. I don't want to take any unnecessary risks.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Okay, I understand.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She quickly pulls away from me and collapses on the bed. I can't see her expression because her face is pressed against the bed, but from the way her shoulders are shaking, it looks like she's crying.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, I don't want you to see my face, so please leave. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I nodded at her words and left the bedroom. As I closed the door, I could hear her crying, as if she had finally stopped holding back.</p>
<p>&#12288;It was to be expected that she would cry. It was her intention to turn back at this point, so I pretended not to hear her and walked away from the door.</p>
<p>&#12288;If her husband is still alive, it's going to be quite a mess. I feel bad for the man I haven't seen yet, but I hope he's not alive.</p>
<p>&#12288;I suddenly felt a gaze on me and looked in that direction to see Elle and the maid staring at me. I thought they had come out right after I entered, but now I heard Natalia crying, and they seemed to think she had been dumped.</p>
<p>&#12288;The maid looked at me with contempt, as if she was looking at an enemy of women, but Elle's gaze was somehow happy. I wondered if she believed that I would not accept her invitation.</p>
<p>&#12288;Under the gaze of both of them, I headed for the storage room to escape. When Alec noticed I was back, he gave me a sympathetic look, which I took as a sign of displeasure, and lay down on the bed I had just made.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;The next day, we were to leave early in the morning, and to my surprise, Natalia insisted on going with us.</p>
<p>&#12288;There was not a trace of tears left on her face, and I knew it was an act.</p>
<p>&#12300;I think it would be better if I go with them so that the other elves won't misunderstand.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What are you talking about, Natalia? Why should you do anything to help the humans?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's right, Natalia. I will not allow you to go with these people.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't you feel bad for Levin?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As expected, the other elves were very opposed to her, but she just listened to their words without a care in the world.</p>
<p>&#12288;As for me, I think it would be more convenient if she came, but there are a few people who are opposed to her coming along. I was expecting Elle to be against it, but to my surprise, Sagami was also against it.</p>
<p>&#12288;I didn't see any sign that he disliked her or anything, but I wondered if there was something inconvenient about it, so I secretly spoke to Sagami.</p>
<p>&#12300;Why are you against her coming with us? It would be safer with her in the forest. I was expecting you to agree.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Hmm, I'll tell you what, Yard-dono. The reason I'm against it is because I suspect that you and she are not on the same page.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... You mean that. Sure, she asked me out, but that's kind of an elf habit. And I've told her that I won't be getting to know her like that during this mission.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Even if you are good, she is the problem. I know the habits of elves, but I've heard that they are so difficult to control with reason. Don't you think it would be too late if something happened? Her husband is probably still alive.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... What?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Please do not tell anyone else about this. The name of the elf I spoke to about Leshiana was Levin, his name is the same as her husband. I don't know how he ended up in Royal Capital, but since there's a chance he's still alive, I can't just sit back and watch her be unfaithful.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Indeed. I wouldn't be surprised if one of the elves that was sold was her husband.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;What a coincidence. If it really was her husband, was I on the verge of adultery? I'm glad I didn't get carried away by the mood of the moment.</p>
<p>&#12288;But then again, there are many problems with taking her with me. I don't want to do anything to her, but if she attacks me in my sleep like Elle did, I might not be able to resist. I don't think I can expect her to be chaste because there are other people around.</p>
<p>&#12300;I can't just abandon someone who saved my life! Just leave me alone!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;While I was talking to Sagami, there seemed to be a change on the other side.</p>
<p>&#12288;Natalia screamed loudly and then ran off into the forest. Some of the elves chased after her, but they could not seem to catch up with Natalia's speed. Eventually, they would be able to outrun her.</p>
<p>&#12288;We decided to leave before she came back. I feel bad for her, but after hearing Sagami's story, I don't think she should come with us either. Elves are stronger mentally than humans, but when they're in heat, they're not to be trusted at all.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>9.2</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;After we left Natalia's village, we went around to different villages, but there were no elves who knew where the High Elves were. In fact, there were no elves who were willing to help us.</p> <p>&#12288;That's why I'm currently camping out in the forest.</p> <p>&#12288;Since then, whenever we found a village, we tried to negotiate with them to let us stay, but instead of letting us stay, we were turned away and even attacked just for trying to enter the village.</p> <p>&#12288;I could tell that the initial reaction of the village was thanks to Natalia's presence, but I couldn't do anything about it now since we had left without her.</p> <p>&#12288;It was so cold that I was afraid I might die if I didn't sleep properly, so Elle and I took turns putting up thermal wards, but thanks to them, I couldn't get a good night's sleep. I tried to warm myself by the fire once, but the elves got angry at the fire and attacked me, so of course I couldn't use the fire.</p> <p>&#12288;When I saw the others sleeping, I desperately tried to hold back the urge to punch them, but it was time for my turn, so I woke Elle up.</p> <p>&#12300;Oh, ......, it's my shift. ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Elle, too, has dark circles in her eyes from the exhaustion of the past few days. No matter how you look at it, she haven't had enough sleep. If we can't find the High Elves in another couple of days, we'll leave them here and go home.</p> <p>&#12288;Elle looks like she's about to collapse as she tries to put up her wards, but they don't seem to be working. My wards have already been lifted, so the cold outside has been blowing in since a while ago. The others are also looking cold, but I don't care about that.</p> <p>&#12300;Master, here you go.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Lucia, who was awake with me, hands me some water and preserved food. Since I can't use fire, I'm using magic to heat the water directly, but I can't use much magic because I haven't recovered my magic power due to lack of sleep, and the magic consumption to keep the wards up is ridiculous.</p> <p>&#12300;You seem to be getting tired, are you okay?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I'm not really okay. It's hard to keep warding with just the two of us.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Why don't you make such a magic tool?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Even if I have magic stones, I can't make them because I don't have any other materials.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I see. ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Looking at Lucia's disappointed expression, I get the impression that she's a different person from when I first met her. I wish she would have taken this attitude from the beginning.</p> <p>&#12288;In the first place, she was a young lady who showed her good upbringing as long as she was quiet. Now, though, she has tattoos all over her body and looks like she could be from some tribe.</p> <p>&#12300;Master, may I have a word?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Elle is calling me, so I approach her. It seems that the control of the wards hasn't been going well since a while ago, has something gone wrong?</p> <p>&#12300;What's wrong? Are you about to run out of magic power?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;No, the magic power is fine, but since a while ago, when I tried to set up a ward, it didn't go well. ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Elle looks at me with a troubled face. she has good face, but the shadows make her look much older.</p> <p>&#12288;But she can't get the warding to work? There are three possible causes.</p> <p>&#12288;First, there is a lack of magic power. This is when there is not enough magic power to maintain the wards, and holes are made in the wards or they disappear.</p> <p>&#12288;Secondly, if it is interfered with by other magics. This is different because the activation itself will fail.</p> <p>&#12288;After thinking that far, I came up with the reason why she can't set up her wards well. The last one is when there is too much magic floating in the air and the control of the magic formula is unstable.</p> <p>&#12288;If you're a magician like me, you can control it like you breathe, so I don't know, but if you're a magician like Elle, the magic formula interferes with the magic floating in air, and you can't control it well.</p> <p>&#12288;This means that there is something nearby that emits a lot of magic power. If someone is not releasing a ridiculously large amount of magic, then there is a pool of magic power nearby.</p> <p>&#12288;I took a closer look at Lucia and noticed that her cheeks were slightly flushed. The magic imprint on her is to absorb and store the magic power floating in the space inside her womb. She can turn it on and off at any time, but it seems to have absorbed too much of the magic power here, thanks to the fact that I usually tell her not to turn it off without permission.</p> <p>&#12288;Incidentally, when a large amount of magic flows through a magic imprint, it causes a pleasant sensation, and from the way she looks, I can tell that there is a large amount of magic in this space.</p> <p>&#12288;I guess we are finally approaching a place that seems to be the location of the High Elves. This means we might be able to meet them tomorrow.</p> <p>&#12300;Um, master. ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Lucia tugged lightly on my arm. It seems she's about to reach her limit.</p> <p>&#12300;Yeah, I get it. You can stop the absorption now. Elle, I need you to release the warding once.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Sure, it's about time.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Elle knows what's going on with Lucia, so she doesn't react as she did with Natalia, but simply releases the warding.</p> <p>&#12288;I take Lucia to a place where Elle and the others can't see us. Even though I know they're asleep, I don't know when they'll wake up. She probably doesn't want to be seen either.</p> <p>&#12288;When we get to a place where she can't be seen completely, she lifts her skirt, a little hesitantly. She already seemed to be excited, and the part of her underwear that hit her crotch was damp.</p> <p>&#12300;Master, please ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;The way she turns her face away and says it with embarrassment is quite cute. I was the only one who could handle her, so she had no choice but to ask me, even if she didn't want to. I'm not doing it for a hobby either, it's just for experimentation, but I guess that doesn't matter to her.</p> <p>&#12288;I pull down her underwear and insert my finger into her vagina. It's already wet, and it swallows my finger effortlessly.</p> <p>&#12300;Mmmm......mmm......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;She holds her mouth with one hand to prevent her voice from leaking out, but it tightens in response to my finger. I guess she feels it regardless of her intentions.</p> <p>&#12288;I plunge my finger in so deep that I can get my hand in, and reach her cervix to break the seal I've placed on her. Then I pulls my finger out and looks at her standing there with her legs shaking.</p> <p>&#12300;You can let it out now.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, fuhh. ...... mmm .....&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;She puts some pressure on her lower abdomen, and a little later a round pearl falls out. This is an artificial magic stone that was created in her womb. The seal is meant to prevent this from falling until it reaches a certain size.</p> <p>&#12288;The magic stone that came out this time was about three centimeters in diameter. By my standards, it's a pretty good quality magic stone. If I sell it in a store, I can make a lot of money. It's proof that this world's magic technology is still in its infancy.</p> <p>&#12300;Lucia, that's enough.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Y-yes ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I look at Lucia, who is hurriedly getting dressed. Originally I was going to try impregnating a demon or a child of another species, but I didn't expect to be able to fund it, so I left it as it is now. If I wanted to experiment, all I had to do was get a convenient person other than her.</p> <p>&#12288;If you say I have feelings for her, you may be right. But that's not the same as the feelings I have for Tia and Sophie. I don't think I want them to get hurt, but Elle and Lucia are just experimental subjects.</p> <p>&#12300;Thank you very much, Master.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Don't worry about it. Let me know when you're about to let it out again.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;...... Yes, sir.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I think she understands this, and she has started to obey me even when I'm looking at her. But her self-esteem seems to be hurt, and she always looks disappointed when she takes out the magic stone.</p> <p>&#12288;By the way, no one but Elle and I have ever seen her current body, but if they did, they would probably think she was a demon or something. It is said that tattoos are usually placed on the back or some other part of the body, and only demons in stories have tattoos like hers that cover their entire body.</p> <p>&#12288;I went back to where Elle and the others were and decided to sleep until the next shift. In the end, Elle couldn't get the warding to work, and by the time I took over, the inside of the warding had cooled down considerably.</p> 			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p> 			<p>&#12288;The next day, I told everyone that there was likely to be a magical pool nearby, and we began to search the area. Since we were going to search a large area, we split up into several groups and began looking in the directions we had decided on. I would go with Lucia, Alec would go with the maid, and the other two would go alone. I can protect myself on my own.</p> <p>&#12288;We all went in different directions, but after a while, we saw Sagami coming in our direction. He must have gone in the opposite direction from us.</p> <p>&#12300;Sagami-dono, why are you coming this way?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;No, I was supposed to be going straight ahead. ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Hmmm... Sagami must be used to working in the forest like this, so he wouldn't have taken a wrong turn. That means there must be a trick that even he didn't notice.</p> <p>&#12288;I walked in the direction he was supposed to go. I was expecting to see no change after walking for a while, but suddenly I heard a warning sound in my head.</p> <p>(&#12302;The first magic barrier has been penetrated. The second magic barrier has been penetrated. The third magic barrier has been penetrated. The fourth magic barrier has been penetrated. Final magic barrier successfully resisted. magic effect reduced. Tracing attack magic failed. Retreat is recommended.&#12303;)</p> <p>&#12288;It seems that all the barriers have been breached. I was a little suprised with the unexpected situation.</p> <p>&#12288;If you want to break through all of my magic barriers, you'll need a strategic grade magic formula to do so. In other words, it means that there are people around here who can use that kind of magic. I hurriedly switched to my battle-strengthened barrier, but it had no effect on the magics they had already passed through.</p> <p>&#12288;I tried to move back, but for some reason I couldn't move straight back. On the contrary, I felt as if I was facing sideways, even though I was facing forward. It seems to be a magic that disturbs my sense of direction and location.</p> <p>&#12288;I have an idea of what this magic is. It's a Type 4 Strategic Class Magic, the &lt;<ruby>Otherworld Reversal<rt>Another World</rt></ruby>&gt;. The more you narrow down the range, the more effective it becomes.</p> <p>&#12288;This time it seems to be only around the magic pool, so the effect must be immensely strong. It's no wonder that my magic barrier was pulled out. I was caught off guard by this.</p> <p>&#12288;I immediately drew a magic circle here as well. Activate Type 4 Strategic Class Magic, &lt;<ruby>Advanced Disabling Warding<rt>Greater Antimagic Field</rt></ruby>&gt;. This is another magic that dramatically increases its effectiveness when its range is reduced. It nullifies all magical effects used by anyone other than the caster.</p> <p>&#12288;By limiting the range to only my vicinity, I was able to nullify the &lt;<ruby>Otherworld Reversal<rt>Another World</rt></ruby>&gt;. I looked at the other two and saw that they were going in different directions. When I approached them and stopped them, they seemed to realize that they had been going in a completely wrong direction.</p> <p>&#12300;I had no idea that there was magic that could target such a large area ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;It's a great magic. Did master not get hit?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;No, it was a close call for me too. I'll have to be more careful in the future.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Seeing that there are so many magic formulas around the magic pool, it seems that the High Elves are definitely here. My magic won't last that long, so I'd better get everyone on the way as soon as possible.</p> <p>&#12288;I called the other people over and brought them into the area of effect of my warding and headed in the direction I had just left. The scenery of the forest, which used to be nothing but trees, is gradually changing, becoming more like the scenery found in a magic pool, with mysterious floating objects emitting light and magic stones occasionally falling to the ground.</p> <p>&#12288;In a magical pool, there is too much magical power in the space for ordinary creatures to survive for long. In an hour, an ordinary person would die of insanity from the magical power. Even magicians like the shopkeeper of the magic store and Adriana, who are supposed to be far more tolerant than normal people, would not be able to stay here for even a week.</p> <p>&#12288;Now, thanks to my warding, the magic power has disappeared along with the effects of the &lt;<ruby>Otherworld Reversal<rt>Another World</rt></ruby>&gt;, but if I were to break this warding, Alec and the maid would fall first. Lucia is also in danger now that she hasn't activated the imprint. Sagami would last about an hour.</p> <p>&#12288;Are the High Elf creatures that live in a place like this really elves?</p> 			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p> 			<p>&#12288;After walking for a while, we saw a building that looked like a temple in front of us. Apparently, that was where the High Elves lived.</p> <p>&#12288;There was no gatekeeper, so I let myself in. There was a large space inside, with several passages in the back. As I wondered if it was okay to go deeper, an elf walked from the front passage.</p> <p>&#12300;I didn't think you'd actually make it here, but welcome. My Lord is waiting for you, so please come this way.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Oh, we're from the kingdom of .......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;We know all about your situation, Alec-sama. As for alliances, please listen to my lord first.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;!!&#12288;...... All right. Please show me the way right away.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;They know what's going on here. I'm not sure where they've been watching us.</p> <p>&#12288;The fact that they knows about us, and the magic they just used, It seems that his master is capable of using a magic formula that far exceeds the level of magic technology in this world.&nbsp;If we could form an alliance, we could be expected to be quite a force to be reckoned with, but would such a person really cooperate with the kingdom?</p> <p>&#12300;Please, this is the room.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;He stopped in front of a room and urged us to go inside. As we walked in, Alec first, we saw a figure sitting behind a long desk, which made us all gasp.</p> <p>&#12288;There was a woman with a beautiful figure, more well-dressed than an elf.</p> <p>&#12288;Her white skin, platinum hair, and overall white clothing gave her a fantastic and unworldly impression. Her face was so perfectly formed that it could almost be called a doll. She's probably the most beautiful woman I've ever met. Alec and the others forgot to breathe as they gazed at her.</p> <p>&#12300;Welcome, guests. I am Elaine, the master of this house.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Ah, yes, I am Alec Roy Gilflea of the Kingdom of the Henrient. I am here to form an alliance with the elves of Leshiana.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, I am aware of that, Alec-sama. But I'm afraid you won't get the response you want.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;.........does that mean that it is impossible for us to work together?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;The people of Leshiana do not wish to fight. We understand that if someone is attacking us, we should take up arms and fight, but if we cannot defend ourselves, we should be destroyed, don't you think?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Isn't it unethical to sit back and ignore the threat of the Demon Empire?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;The demon empire and the kingdom are the same thing. It's not like the other side is trying to attack us, so there's no reason for Leshiana to go out of our way to invade another country.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;If we work together, we'll guarantee the safety of Leshiana even if the Demon Empire attacks, wouldn't you say?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;That would be a pointless proposition. I don't think the elves of Leshiana will ask for help from others to protect the forest.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;It seems that Elaine is not willing to give up at all. Well, if she could use such a powerful magic, it's unlikely that they would be destroyed by the Demon Empire.</p> <p>&#12300;Then can you tell me what conditions you would be willing to form an alliance with?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;..........We don't have any. The elves of Leshiana prefer peace the most. No one wants to get caught up in the maelstrom of war if they don't have to.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I see. ......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;For a moment, her words choked. In other words, there is something to hope for, but she can't say what it is. I'd like to use &lt;Memory Reading&gt; here, but there's a chance she'll resist, so I reject it.</p> <p>&#12288;However, one thing came to mind after listening to what she said earlier. If my prediction is correct, I might be able to sway the minds of the High Elves.</p> <p>&#12288;I'm sorry Alec, but I don't think you'll be able to convince them to form an alliance, so I'll negotiate on your behalf from here.</p> <p>&#12300;I'm sorry, but I can't keep warding them off any longer. I'd like to talk to you outside the magic pool.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I see, but your situation is none of my business. If you want to get out of here, I'll have him send you, but what do you want?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Elaine said, pointing to the elf who had led us here. Come to think of it, this guy is moving around in this place without a care in the world. He seems to be quite capable.</p> <p>&#12300;Alec-dono, why don't you leave the rest of the negotiations to me? You can take the credit.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;...... I see, let's just leave this place quietly. I'll leave the rest to you.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;The others left, leaving me to my own devices. As he was leaving, Alec gave me a look as if he was trying to tell me something. Don't worry, I'll give you the credit.</p> <p>&#12288;The rest of us, Elaine and I, faced each other. Now the negotiations are about to begin.</p> <p>&#12300;Well then, are you sure you want to be the next negotiator?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, you already know my name, Yard Al Werner.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Yes, I know who you are. I've heard you'&#8216;re quite a strong man, though not as strong as Alec-sama.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I haven't done as much as you say.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Apparently Elaine doesn't know much about what I've done. At this rate, it doesn't look like she was looking directly at me with her magic. Maybe she heard about it from the elves outside the forest.</p> <p>&#12288;It's a good thing she doesn't know much about me anyway. She will underestimate me and let her guard down.</p> <p>&#12300;Now, before we start talking, there's one thing I want to tell you.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;What it is?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;The kingdom is planning to form an alliance with Leshiana, but as for me, I don't mind if we don't have to be allies with the Wood Elves.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;............I don't understand what do you mean by that. I thought the kingdom was trying to form an alliance with the elves of Leshiana?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;That's what Alec-dono said, but I personally decided that was not the case. The kingdom considers all the elves living in Leshiana to be one force, but it doesn't seem to me that the high elves and the wood elves are coexisting.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;The fact that none of the Wood Elves knew the detailed whereabouts of the High Elves, and her attitude as if she was someone else that I had just felt, does not make it seem like the High Elves are ruling the Wood Elves.</p> <p>&#12288;In fact, it seems that the Wood Elves just unilaterally adore the High Elves and the High Elves don't care about them.</p> <p>&#12300;I see, that's an interesting thought. Please continue.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;The advanced warding that was outside and the attitude of someone else from earlier. The High Elves are not leading the Wood Elves. And yet, as the Wood Elves continue to keep the secrets of the High Elves, somehow the Wood Elves are doing the High Elves a favor.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;The relationship between the High Elves and the Wood Elves is not one of coexistence or domination, it is a one-sided relationship from the Wood Elves. It's more like a relationship between a god and its followers. The fact that the traders were attacked by bandits and there was no retaliation or protest means that the High Elves are not the ones ruling them.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;That's not true. They are an important part of the forest.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;A part of the forest is just a broken branch or leaf, isn't it? If you think about it as a country with High Elves as its leaders, it's unthinkable that they would stand idly by while their people, the Elves, are being attacked. Isn't that fact proof that you don't care about them?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;.......&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;If my guess is correct, I would like to form an alliance with the High Elves alone first. It doesn't matter if we don't get the cooperation of the Wood Elves. Perhaps if the High Elves are with us, they will side with the High Elves without saying a word.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;She listened to my story to the end without changing her expression. I thought it was a mistake and tried to correct it a little, but she sighed before I could, so I didn't go through with it at the last minute.</p> <p>&#12300;I guess you passed for now. We are certainly not the rulers of this forest. They probably think we are the guardians of the forest since we have protected it from outside enemies several times. But now that you know that, what kind of conditions will you offer us this time?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;That would make things a lot easier. If the Wood Elves had a strange sense of protection, it would have been difficult to negotiate, but if all I had to do was satisfy the wishes of the High Elves, it would not be as easy.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;You think they already know what we want? You seem so sure of yourself. Then let us hear it.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Sure, it's much the same as what a being like you wants most. Eternal life, an indestructible body, an immortal mind. In other words, to be equal to God.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;...... Why do you think we want such a dreamlike thing? And isn't what you said something that every living being desires at one time or another?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;You don't have to be so tough. I've already figured out who you are. It's a defective spirit without a nucleus, an existence that appears in the magic pools very rarely. And they want the core more than anything else. In order to become a perfect being.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;!!!&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;For the first time, her expression wavered at my words. I guess she thought she hadn't been found out, but there was no way that the people living in this place could be living beings.</p> <p>&#12288;It could be either a ghost or a spirit, but if a ghost entered the magic pool, it would definitely disappear. So, by process of elimination, it was a spirit.</p> <p>&#12288;Although she called herself a high elf, she was not a living being, but a magical body, a kind of god or spirit, and she was probably a mess, living on in an incomplete state.</p> <p>&#12288;Ordinary spirits have a nucleus that keeps the magic power that sustains their bodies from leaking out, but beings like her do not have a nucleus, so their magic power is constantly diffusing. This is the reason for their short lifespan and the fact that they never leaves the magic pool.</p> <p>&#12288;In a magical pool, there is much more magical power in the space than in other places, so it is harder for the magical power to diffuse. Even so, it is not possible to stop it completely, but considering the fact that it can't last more than a year in its normal state, it can survive for a much longer time.</p> <p>&#12288;But it's just a badly made product. If it was in perfect condition, it wouldn't have to live quietly in such a pool of magical power. It is the true spirit that does not have to live in fear of death due to the spread of magic power.</p> <p>&#12288;Perhaps my suggestion was unexpected, but the expression on her face, which had not changed at all until a moment ago, collapsed and she became flustered.</p> <p>&#12300;...... How did you know who we were? Indeed, we are what you say we were.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;It's not surprising that a person who is trying to master the path of magic would know this much.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;However, even if you know what we want, we will never be able to obtain eternal life. In the past, we have tried many things to obtain the nucleus, but all of them have failed.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;If you can't do it, I won't make it a condition. I've already developed a magic to give nucleus to spirits a long time ago.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;What!? Is that true!?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;Her calm demeanor of the past has changed completely. It seems that she is very attracted to the price I offered her. It's hard to believe it's the same person as before, shaking her body gingerly as if she can't wait for my response.</p> <p>&#12288;For my part, just being able to meet a rare, albeit incomplete, spirit was interesting enough for me, so I thought it would be okay to add a few more conditions. The magic I mentioned earlier was also one that I hadn't had a chance to use since it was only mentioned in the paper. It's not something I'm willing to give away.<br /></p> <p>&#12300;Of course. If you want to form an alliance, I can give the magic to all the High Elves.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I would love to! If that's the case, I'll accept your offer of an alliance.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;I am grateful for that. It would mean a lot to me to have come this far.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;But before that, let me make one thing clear. I need to know if you can really use this magic.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;The necessary items for the ceremony are in the luggage my apprentice brought back earlier. Can I have the proof tomorrow?&#12301;</p> <p>&#12300;Sure, it can be done when it's convenient for you.&#12301;</p> <p>&#12288;I asked how many High Elves there were, since I needed to know how many magic stones were needed for the ceremony, and I was told that there were seven in all.</p> <p>&#12288;That was the end of the negotiations for now. I'll bring it back tomorrow, but for now I'm going home. The lack of sleep I've been getting for the past few days is starting to wear off my magic.</p>
