<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; A Brief Encounter with a Disciple</h3>

ï¸Ž<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.1</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;With the loading of supplies finished, it was finally time to leave. Many people in the castle, including the king, came to see us off. The king and the princes gave words of encouragement to the heroes one after another.</p>
<p>&#12288;The other heroes had bracelets firmly attached to their arms. If that's the bracelet, which means the heroes have already been manipulated.&nbsp;What a pathetic bunch, especially since I thought Sagami wouldn't fall for it, which is even more shocking.</p>
<p>&#12288;As for me, I'm dealing with Sophie, who is weeping and bidding me farewell. The fact that I was making the princess cry attracted a lot of attention from the people around me. I hoped that I wouldn't stand out too much in a public place, but she didn't notice my concern.</p>
<p>&#12300;Heroes, I ask you to save our country.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, then I will go! We will definitely defeat the soldiers of the Demon Empire!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Alec said on our behalf. I saw Tia among the people watching the carriage leave the castle gate. She wanted to follow me, but unfortunately she couldn't make the transport mission this time. She even hugged me and wouldn't leave me while we were preparing to leave. I might have raised her affection a little too much.</p>
<p>&#12288;The people in the castle were also cheering for us, so we waved to them and answered their expectations. Alec, who is perfect in appearance, is cheered on by the yellow crowd, but I, in my humble clothes, don't feel any attention from the people around me, as if they think I'm just another ordinary soldier. I'd be grateful if I didn't stand out like this.</p>
<p>&#8251;</p>
<p>&#12288;We left the town and entered the forest on the outskirts. We were in a hurry to get there because of the situation, but it would take at least four days to reach the fortress. We were told that until then we would have to pass through several towns and villages along relatively safe roads, so we would not be needed for two days. Even if it took a long time, it was fine as long as we were safe.</p>
<p>&#12288;The other heroes are in the carriage in the middle of the line, although Sagami is riding in the lead carriage to check the front. I've already cancelled the magic on the bracelets of the heroes. I don't want to be attacked out of the blue.</p>
<p>&#12288;Be that as it may, the inside of the carriage was quite chaotic. I don't feel comfortable talking to Alec or Fairis, and Margarete, who is riding with me, seems to be depressed from the earlier incident and hesitant to talk to me, so I feel very uncomfortable in the carriage at the moment. Fairis is bravely trying to talk to her, but there seems to be no response to her valiant efforts.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I, the one who caused this, was huddled in a corner, unable to bear the heavy atmosphere, Alec came close to me. I thought this guy didn't talk much to heroes other than Fairis, but I guess he couldn't stand this heavy atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-dono, do you know why Margarete-sama is so downhearted? In the morning, she seemed to be radiating a spirit befitting royalty, but what is it that has her so depressed?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, I don't know either.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, I hope that somehow Fairis-dono can help her get back on her feet. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Give it up. Unless I, the original culprit, can say that my relationship with Sophie was a lie, she won't be able to recover so easily. I wonder if it's time for me to go tell Fairis to give up.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I secretly used &lt;Paradise Happiness&gt; on Margarete as a test, she had an expression of lifelessness and only her mouth was grinning. It was a pretty creepy sight, and even Fairis was taken aback. After the narcotic had been created in her brain, her smile did not disappear even when the magic was canceled. It would have been better not to try it.</p>
<p>&#12300;T-that's right! Yard-sama, I have a favor to ask!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;At last, Fairis came running towards me. Perhaps it was because she had seen it up close, but her face was slightly pale.</p>
<p>&#12300;A favor?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes. I heard that Yard-sama is an expert in magic. If possible, I would like you to teach me magic.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Hmm, it's true that I'd rather have a lecture on magic than spend my time in this atmosphere.</p>
<p>&#12288;The problem is that my communication skills are not good enough to give a lecture that these guys can understand.</p>
<p>&#12300;What steps do you take when you invoke a magic?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Let's see.......by offering prayers and magic power to the gods, power is given to the body, and the magic is activated by trying to get it out of the body. Of course, the potency depends on your faith in God.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I knew that, but my head hurt. I mean, what the hell is this woman talking about? The god she believes in doesn't exist in this world, so who is giving her what?</p>
<p>&#12288;It's no good calling it magic in the first place. Since magic technology is a legitimate technology, we need to make people understand that if everyone uses the same formula, the effect will be the same.</p>
<p>&#12300;That premise is wrong. It is not faith that is needed to exercise magic, but magic power and knowledge. The basic recovery formula is based on the activation of the body, so it is not that difficult to construct a formula. If you can compose the right formula, you can use it without chanting, like this.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I put a wound on my arm and activated a lower level &lt;Minor Heal&gt;, and the wound closed up in an instant. Seeing the two of them looking at the closed scar with surprised expressions, I realized once again that they really thought I couldn't even use this level of magic.</p>
<p>&#12300;The current magic was one of the simplest of the recovery magics. The advanced magics can reconstitute a lost body, but since it is a phenomenon that defies the natural order, the composition of the magics is much more complicated than the ones used earlier. If the two of you want to use it without chanting, you'll need to understand the formula even more.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama could also use recovery magic, right? As expected of a wizard with the ability to be chosen as a hero.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-dono was also a devout follower of God, wasn't you? Your ability to heal without chanting is proof of that.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Did you two hear what I just said......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I gave them a thorough lecture on the basics of the magic until we reached the next town, but in the end they didn't understand. I'm going to stop teaching these guys about the magic now.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;We arrived at the last town of the day in the evening, just as the sun was about to set. We were told that we would be camping outside the town today.</p>
<p>&#12288;It had been arranged that we could stay at the town's inn, but Alec politely refused, saying that he couldn't stay at the inn himself while letting the soldiers sleep outside.</p>
<p>&#12288;The soldiers told us that we could at least keep watch by ourselves, so we are currently lounging around in a tent that Sagami has pitched. Of course, the tent is made of insulating material. He's very capable man, after all.</p>
<p>&#12288;I relaxed in the tent for a while, but I still felt restless when I had nothing to do. There was nothing to pass the time in the camp, so I decided to go to town, and buy some liquor. Tia had already given me some pocket money, so I should be able to get by.</p>
<p>&#12288;After a while, I was wandering around in the back alleys.</p>
<p>&#12288;I was trying to find a place to drink, but none of the stores had signs up. At first, I didn't notice this and thought there were a lot of private houses, and when I came to my senses, I was already lost in the alleyway.</p>
<p>&#12288;There were no people around, and as I walked along, thinking that I should have asked someone where the store was, I heard a voice in the back, so I headed in that direction.</p>
<p>&#12288;There were two men attacking a woman. I came without any warning, so of course they noticed me.</p>
<p>&#12300;Please! Please help me!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The woman's clothes were tattered, and I could see at a glance that she had been assaulted. She still had her underwear on, so it seemed she hadn't been raped.</p>
<p>&#12288;The men were all wearing leather armor, so they must have been mercenaries or something. It's disgusting that their crotches are standing up.</p>
<p>&#12300;What the hell? You've come to save this woman?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;If you don't want to get killed, get the hell out of here!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I might be surprised if you yell at me all of a sudden. I didn't come here to save her, but I was annoyed, so I unleashed a no-motion &lt;Fear&gt;. The men who were hit by the magic collapsed and blew bubbles. They must have been so terrified that their hearts were breaking.</p>
<p>&#12288;The woman was surprised that the men who had been attacking her had suddenly collapsed, but she turned her head to look at me, as if she had realized that I had done it.</p>
<p>&#12288;I hadn't noticed her earlier, but she was quite a pretty girl with red hair. Her clothes were torn, revealing her underwear and skin. Her breasts were also large enough to be easily seen on her clothes. I could understand the feelings of the two men who had attacked her.</p>
<p>&#12288;Then, a thought occurred to me. The men who had just attacked her were there. In front of me, there was a nice, half-naked woman staring at me. There is no one around. Considering that no one came to the scream earlier, the security here is quite bad. There are probably a few people out there who get attacked like she did.</p>
<p>&#12288;So far, I'm the only witness. In other words, no matter what happens here, as long as I can play with her memory, everything will be fine. The unfamiliarity of the carriage and the stressful environment had left her with a bit of a sex drive, so I'll just attack her instead she's attacked by the men.</p>
<p>&#12300;U-um, thank you very much. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She didn't realize what I was up to, and she thanked me for saving her from a dangerous situation, but I ignored her and put up a soundproof barrier so that her screams wouldn't leak out.</p>
<p>&#12288;I push her down to the ground and hold her wrists to prevent her from escaping. I ignores her words of thanks and she looks at me curiously as I work mysteriously. She seems to have stopped thinking because of the sudden event.</p>
<p>&#12288;She realizes that the man she thought had saved her was actually just another rapist, and rushes to escape, but it's too late. I can see her white skin through her torn clothes, which fuels my excitement.</p>
<p>&#12300;Nooo, stop! Let me go!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;A woman's disgusted voice satisfies a man's desire for domination. I realized that this was a good thing.</p>
<p>&#12288;Holding her down as she raged, I stripped off her clothes to reveal her shapely breasts and good-sized nipples. Her breasts were probably not as big as Tia's, but they were still quite large.</p>
<p>&#12288;I couldn't wait to try to take her body, but her resistance was more fierce and troublesome than I expected.</p>
<p>&#12300;Be quiet, or you'll end up like them.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The men are only unconscious, but at first glance they appear to be dead. The sight of the men who hadn't moved at all may have broken her resistance, but her body relaxed. It seemed that the threat have had a remarkable effect.</p>
<p>&#12288;She stopped resisting, and as I stroked her body and removed the last of her underwear, I saw that she had no hair on her pubic area. Tia was the same, but do all women in this world shave this place?</p>
<p>&#12288;When she looked at me with trembling, frightened eyes, I felt a surge of torment her.</p>
<p>&#12300;With such lewd breasts, you must have been luring men, right?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;N-no, you're wrong! Hyaahh!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I pinched her nipples with my fingers and played with them, but she didn't show any sign of resistance despite her surprise. I think most women would flail about desperately in a situation like this. She seemed to be surprisingly fond of it.</p>
<p>&#12288;She was surprisingly responsive, so now I squeezed her large breasts and licked up her slightly hardened nipples with my tongue.</p>
<p>&#12288;She was trying hard to keep her mouth shut while she was breathing roughly, probably trying to suppress her moans. I aim for the moment when she gets used to the feel of my tongue and her expression softens a little, and bite her nipple sweetly.</p>
<p>&#12300;Aaaaah! You can't do that!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Huh, what's wrong? If you don't tell me, I won't understand.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't bite my nipples! Please don't!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;There was no way I was going to stop it even if she told me not to bite, so I bit into her nipple and sucked on it as hard as I could while playing with her other breast with my hand. She couldn't stop moaning, as if she had lost the room she had just had.</p>
<p>&#12288;Still, even though the breast milk doesn't come out, sucking on her nipples felt sweet. Tia was also the same, which is strange.</p>
<p>&#12300;What's wrong, did you feel it just by playing with your breasts?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, I'm not feeling it. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Okay, then let's find out.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I forced her crotch open and stuck my finger into her vaginal cavity to find out what was going on inside. She seems to be a virgin. If she's a virgin and feeling it when she's about to be raped, she must be a very slutty woman.</p>
<p>&#12300;No, please don't do that. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You said you didn't feel it, but your crotch seems to be wet, what's this?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When I showed her my fingers wet with her love juice, she turned her face away in embarrassment. If you're embarrassed, you shouldn't be so tough, you silly girl.</p>
<p>&#12300;Here, look at me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I tugged on her cheek to make her look at me. She still didn't look at me, so I grabbed her cheek and made her look at me. Tears are welling up in her eyes, but they only incites my torment.</p>
<p>&#12300;You're not a good listener, if you're not going to be very honest. I'll have to use violence.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;..! I'm sorry! I'll listen to you, so don't hit me!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's right, if you behave yourself, I won't be rough with you. Do you understand?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She nodded at my words. She finally calmed down, so I took off my bottom and took out my cock. She turns her face away, as if seeing it for the first time, but she seems to be curious and keeps glancing at it.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I put the cock to her vaginal hole, she closed her eyes as if she was ready. Maybe it's because seeing it makes her more afraid, but when she reacts like that, I want to abuse her even more.</p>
<p>&#12300;What's your name?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Eh? My name is M-Mira. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see, that's a pretty good name. It's a good name for you, you lewd woman.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Y-yes. Thank you. ......!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The moment she was distracted by conversation, I penetrated her secret crack in one swift motion and felt the touch of her virginity membrane breaking. She was moving her mouth like a fish, probably too sore to speak.</p>
<p>&#12288;I penetrated her cervix at once, but it was quite narrow inside. Even though virginity is a tight fit, the pain seemed to have caused her vagina to spasm, and the tightness was so tight that it felt like it was going to tear, and it hurt more than it felt good. I'm not kidding, it hurt a lot.</p>
<p>&#12300;Gguhh, This is not good!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It's so tight that I really thought it was going to tear, so I hurriedly used &lt;Paradise Happiness&gt; on her. The euphoric feeling she felt from the effect of the magic eased the pain, and the tightness loosened to a moderate narrowness.</p>
<p>&#12288;I watched her without moving for a while, and she seemed to be feeling good under the influence of the magic. However, when I moved the cock, the pain came back and distorted her expression in pain. When I started the pistoning motion without caring, she felt euphoric and painful at the same time, and made a tremendous expression.</p>
<p>&#12300;Just the right amount of tightness, keep it like this!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ah, thank you.......very much! Aahnn!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ha, you're a virgin yet you're feeling it! You're one hell of a lewd!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm not a lewd, aahnn! Why, why do I feel that!?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I was getting close to my limit as I watched her panting, her face a mess as both pleasure and pain hit her.</p>
<p>&#12300;Rejoice! I'm going to come inside you!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;..! No, please don't do thaaat!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm about to cum! Take my sperm!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Aaaaah! Don't cum insideeee! I'm gonna have a babyyyyy!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I hold her down as she tries desperately to escape, and then ejaculate as hard as I can into her.</p>
<p>&#12288;She climaxes, screaming in despair as she feels the semen slamming into her vagina. As I feel the pleasure of her vagina tightening, I spit out all the remaining semen inside her.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I pull out my cock, semen drips out and stains her crotch. She doesn't even have the strength to move, and she doesn't even try to escape even though I've left her.</p>
<p>&#12300;Phew......Your name Mira was it? You had a nice body.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It was very refreshing. Now let's clean up the mess.</p>
<p>&#12288;After activating &lt;Fear&gt; on the still fallen girl to make her fall into a coma, I undressed the men, extracted the money, and activated &lt;Memory Extraction&gt; on the three of them. This is a magic that extracts memories in the form of crystals that look like orbs.</p>
<p>&#12288;I extract their memories from the moment they met me until now, and get three orbs, which I immediately slam into the ground. The orbs shattered like glass balls, and the pieces disappeared as if they were melting.</p>
<p>&#12288;Finally, I place one of the men on top of her and apply a timed awakening to be activated after I leave. This will make these men think they attacked her and they will take care of the rest.</p>
<p>&#12288;I deactivate the soundproofing and leave the alleyway.</p>
<p>&#12288;After all, it seems that in this world, it's okay to behave as you please to some extent. Until I can find someone who can resist my magics, I'll have to play around a bit more.</p>
<p>&#12288;I bought some liquor on the way home, but who knows how it happened, but Margarete, who had already recovered, found me and told me not to go to town without saying a word, and confiscated my liquor.</p>
<p>&#12288;I was in a sage mode after having a shot earlier, so I listened to her drowsy sermon earnestly. It was a pity that she confiscated my drink, though.</p>
			
<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3.2</strong></p>

<p>&#12300;I'm bored. Is there anything I can do to pass the time?&#12301;<br /></p>
<p>&#12288;It's been two days since we left for the fortress. We have already entered the area where there might be dangerous demons and soldiers of the Demon Empire may present, but there has been no attack.</p>
<p>&#12288;Before we left, I didn't want any attacks to happen, but after a day of just swinging around in a carriage, I wanted at least one event to happen.</p>
<p>&#12300;Sigh, I thought that wizards are those who strive to improve their magic every day. This is the first time I've met someone as self-deprecating as you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's right, Yard-dono. You must not neglect your daily practice in order to improve your power. I can't accompany you in your magic training, but if you want to train your body, I'll accompany you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;There were two annoying people in the carriage, and one person who was praying all the time, wondering what the fun was doing that.</p>
<p>&#12288;Since there was no one to talk to about the magic, I naturally spent more time in a daze, doing nothing.</p>
<p>&#12288;As Margarete said, I have some things I want to find out about the people and magics of this world, but I don't have any materials or specimens, so there's no way to find out. I even thought about attacking some people to get them. Ahh, I don't care who it is, just let me see what's in your head.</p>
<p>&#12288;Just as I was about to lose consciousness again as I was being rocked by the carriage while thinking such things, I heard a noise outside.</p>
<p>&#12300;An enemy attack!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The moment I heard those words, all four of us in the carriage ran outside.</p>
<p>&#12288;We immediately checked the area, but it seemed that we had been caught by surprise, and one of the carriages in front of us had already been hit. I can hear the sound of gunfire mixed in with the sounds of sword fights and demon roars. It seems that Sagami is engaged in a battle.</p>
<p>&#12300;Heroes, the enemy is said to be a dozen soldiers from the Demon Empire and two black wolves. The black wolves are magical beasts with fur so hard that it is impervious to blades. Sagami-sama is said to be engaging them up ahead, so please hurry and head there.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Understood!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;After receiving Margarete's words, Alec starts running, he's a former knight. I'm going to follow him. Fairis will get in the way in battle because she cannot fight, so she stay behind to treat the injured soldiers.</p>
<p>&#12288;When we come to a place where we can see the battlefield, several soldiers have already fallen, bleeding. They were moaning, so it seemed they were still alive. I felt bad about abandoning my allies, so I applied&nbsp; &lt;Major Heal&gt; to them as I passed by. The soldiers, whose mortal wounds had been healed in an instant, were stunned, unaware of what had happened.</p>
<p>&#12288;In the lead, Alec and Sagami were fighting two huge wolves. The Imperial soldiers may have already been taken care of, but there were still enemy soldiers lying around. Seeing that the bullets were stopped by the wolves' fur, the attack didn't seem to have much effect.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-dono! We'll hold this demon at bay! In the meantime, prepare a spell that can defeat this demon!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Understood.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;If they can keep the wolves at bay, I can slowly draw up a magic circle. I used the nearby scabbard to starts carving a magic circle on the ground. From the side, it looks like I'm just scribbling on the ground, so it must look like a very uncomfortable scene.</p>
<p>&#12288;They looked at me as if they wanted to say something, but I ignored them. In the first place, you need to be able to defeat an enemy of that caliber, if not instantly, without my help. Of course, this is to avoid increasing my workload.</p>
<p>&#12288;After a few minutes of drawing up the magic circle, the two of them still hadn't defeated any of the black wolves. It was true that swords and bullets couldn't penetrate them, but it seemed that they were weaker than I had expected.</p>
<p>&#12300;It's done. Get away from them.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Hearing my words, the two of them quickly distance themselves from the wolves. They were distracted by the wolves, and I took advantage of the opportunity to activate &lt;Disintegration&gt;, a Type 4 offensive magic.</p>
<p>&#12288;The wolves twisted to dodge the rays of light emitted from the magic circle, but they were slightly grazed. At that moment, the body of the two wolves began to rapidly disintegrate from the part that was grazed, and they disappeared into the dust. The two of them looked on in astonishment.</p>
<p>&#12300;...... I was surprised. Your magic was beyond my imagination, Yard-dono.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, I've never imagined that you could use magic to this extent.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;They were surprised by the power of the magic and praised me, but in my original world, it would have been natural to use a magic like that. This magic was originally designed for the removal of waste materials. The fact that you are surprised at this level is proof that you do not yet have enough knowledge and training in magic.</p>
<p>&#12288;Well, I'm not their master. I'm not going to tell them that every time.</p>
<p>&#12300;Everyone, are you okay?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was making sure that the two black wolves had completely disappeared, Fairis came running towards us. She must have come because the sound of the battle had died down. After confirming that we were safe, she started to heal the other wounded soldiers.</p>
<p>&#12288;It would be fine to leave the treatment of the wounded to Fairis, so I decided to fulfill my own purpose.</p>
<p>&#12288;I select a few of the dead enemy soldiers who are in good condition and carry them away. I would have preferred a young magician without a head wound, but I couldn't find anyone who was dressed like a magicians at first glance. I had no choice but to pick up someone who was not wearing armor.</p>
<p>&#12288;What caught my eye was the corpse of a brown-skinned woman with a hood over her head. She might be a sorceress. Short in stature and wearing light clothing that exposed a lot of skin, she was clearly not a soldier.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard-sama, what are you doing?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was selecting a corpse, Margarete approached me. Well, the sight of me scavenging for corpses without participating in the cleanup process would make me look suspicious no matter how you look at it.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, I'm trying to study the magic as you said, and I'm securing human bodies for specimen and preservation.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Do you use any kind of necromantic magic?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, these two have a faint pulse, so I'm just going to open their heads and check their brain structure while they're still alive. And while I'm at it, I'll get some information out of them if I can afford it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I pick up another man who is wearing the same hooded robe as the woman I picked up earlier. It's unusual for a northern country to have brown skin. I wonder if he's an immigrant.</p>
<p>&#12300;I-is that so. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Margarete's face paled slightly at my story. These two are completely dead, but it would be troublesome for people to know that I can reanimate the dead, so I lied to her and told her that they were still alive.</p>
<p>&#12300;Excuse me, that's not something you want to hear as a woman. Forget what I just said.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;.......I'll pretend I never heard anything about the brain. Will you be able to share with us the information you got from the enemy soldiers?&#12301;<br /></p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, of course, then.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Avoiding the soldiers who were transferring the baggage of the attacked wagon to other wagons, I carried the two dead bodies into the nearby forest. I can't show it to anyone from here on....</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;I moved to a secluded spot and set them down. They were brown-skinned, with long ears that I couldn't see because they were hidden by their hair. I thought they were brown-skinned humans, but I wondered if they were of another race. Well, even if it was another race, I needed a sample, so I tied the corpse tightly so that it would not move and started drawing the magic circle.</p>
<p>&#12288;As soon as the magic circle is completed, I apply the Sixth Type of Special Recovery Magic, &lt;Resurrection&gt;. If the brain is intact and the body has been dead for less than twenty-four hours, no matter how bad the condition, it can be revived.</p>
<p>&#12288;When they regained consciousness, they were looking around, but when the man realized that he was tied up, he started to riot. Of course, he didn't seem to come undone. Incidentally, there was one man and one woman.</p>
<p>&#12300;You're awake. How does it feel to be alive again?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Kingdom's Soldier! Damn it, kill him!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Are you a magician?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Then what are you? I'm telling you, I'm not going to tell you anything, even if you torture me!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;That's good, If I brought the wrong one, I would have had to go back to get another corpse.</p>
<p>&#12288;The man seemed to have the energy to shout at me. The woman is trembling, probably having a flashback to the moment of her death.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I approach the man, I cast &lt;Immortality&gt;, a Second Type of Physical Interference Magic. Now the man would not die no matter what I did to him. Even if his whole body is cut to pieces, he can still live.</p>
<p>&#12288;The man doesn't know what has been done to him, but he knows that something has been done to him, so he looks at me with a mixture of anxiety and anger.</p>
<p>&#12300;Now, I will first perform a craniotomy. Don't worry, it won't kill you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Y-you're still going to torture me! No matter what you do to me, I will never say anything to my enemies!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The man is trying to be strong, but I had no reason to fear an opponent who can't move. I activates my light-blade ray-sword and slowly cuts into the man's head, trying not to let the blood splash.</p>
<p>&#12288;He was screaming and flailing in pain, but I held him firmly in place as I didn't want him to lose control.</p>
<p>&#12288;As soon as I finished making the incision, I lifted the skull and opened it up. This was the quickest way to get a live brain.</p>
<p>&#12288;The man continues to flail about, unaware of what's happening to him, while the woman turns pale and shakes when she sees him.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I used &lt;Crystallization&gt; to crystallize his brain alive, the man jumped once and stopped moving. It's a little creepy because even in this state, he won't physically die until the magic wears off.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I deactivated the magic, the man jumped once again and this time stopped moving. Since he had lost his brain, he could no longer be able revived by &lt;Resurrection&gt;.</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, now she's the next one.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When I turned to the woman, she was in tears and shaking her head reluctantly. She seems to think that she will be subjected to the same thing. On closer inspection, her face is very well formed. Her brown skin goes well with her silver hair.</p>
<p>&#12288;She gives the impression of being very active, but right now she is frightened and shrinking. I'd certainly like to get some gender samples, but I've come up with something a little more interesting, and I'm not going to kill her like I would a man.</p>
<p>&#12300;Please forgive me! I'll do anything!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;With this woman wearing overly revealing clothes, I can't help but hear the obscene meaning of what she just said. Except for her breasts, she still looks like a little girl, so she will be popular among perverts with a taste for little girls.</p>
<p>&#12288;For now, I decide to ignore her pleas and open her head to start the next experiment.</p>
<p>&#12288;I hold her down as she cries out and open her head the same way. She is aware of what is happening to her head, so she does not move from the moment her head is opened, but endures the pain with a despairing expression on her face.</p>
<p>&#12300;I ask you a few questions. First of all, are you an elf?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Y-yes! I'm a dark elf.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Can you use any magic in that condition?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, I can't move my hands. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I see, Okay, then I'll release the restraints, but you know what's going on with your head, right? If you don't want to die, don't try to escape.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She nodded her head and I released her from her restraints.</p>
<p>&#12300;You can use any simple magic.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Y-yes! 'The source of life, the flowing thing, the grace of God given from heaven, appear'!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As she chanted the incantation while making some kind of shape with her hands, a sphere of water appeared in front of her. I recorded the movements of her brain at that time and took out the experimental needle I had prepared for just such an occasion.</p>
<p>&#12300;Don't move. If you lose control, you'll be in big trouble.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Eh? Uhm, what are you doing ......! Gah, Ah, Ah, Ah, Aaaaahhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I grabs her head as she looks at me anxiously and sticks the needle in several places. I grabs her by the head and stabs her in several places, which would kill her with ordinary needles. The main purpose is to modify her brain. She turned white with pain and discomfort as her brain was directly tampered with, and made strange noises.</p>
<p>&#12288;I heard the sound of water trickling, and when I looked down, I saw that she was leaking. She seemed to be on the verge of going insane.</p>
<p>&#12288;I couldn't let her go on like this, so I took some time to calm her down. After a while, her eyes came back into focus and her breathing calmed down.</p>
<p>&#12300;Okay, try using the magic you just used one more time.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Eh, ah, yes...&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The water ball appeared in the same way as before, but there was no change in power or accuracy. It's no good, it looks like a failure. It's been a while, so I can't get a good feel for it. I use the &lt;Major Heal&gt; to restore the brain and start to play with the brain by sticking the needle again.</p>
<p>&#12300;Aaahhhh, stooooop! Aaahhhh!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She's trembling from the impossible sensation of having her brain played with directly by each needle prick. I had to hold her head down to keep her still because her hands were going crazy and wait for her to wake up. This was repeated several times.</p>
<p>&#12288;After several times of treatment, she activated the same magic as before, and the water ball became much larger than before. Her eyes widened in surprise at this result.</p>
<p>&#12288;Hmm, it seems that the modification of her brain to make it more efficient was successful. Now that I know how her brain reacts to the use of the magic, I'll be able to apply it more efficiently next time.</p>
<p>&#12288;Now that I had done what I needed to do, I decided to extract the information she had. I put her into a coma with a &lt;Fear&gt; and put her head back on. After also applying an &lt;Major Heal&gt; to prevent scarring, I used the &lt;Memory Extraction&gt; to extract all the information about the Demon Empire and what happened there.</p>
<p>&#12288;I took off her urine-soaked bottom and put on a spare magicians's robe that I found in my luggage. I slapped her cheek to wake her up, and she groaned for a while before waking up.</p>
<p>&#12300;Huh, this place is ......?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Are you all right?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Eh? Ah, yes.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I just happened to notice you lying here, what's wrong?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Is that so. ...... Huh? Why am I here, like I had some kind of mission? Anyway, I have to go home. Huh? Where's my house again?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Oh, I must have made her forget her memories of her hometown by extracting all the information about the Demon Empire. She seems to be confused by the discrepancy in her memory. This was a miscalculation. I didn't mean to do it.</p>
<p>&#12288;Unfortunately, her memories of her family and hometown will never return and she will remain forgotten for the rest of her life.</p>
<p>&#12288;I thought it would be better for her to be killed than to live like this with no place to go back to, so I tried to kill her painlessly out of compassion, but looking at her face, I thought of a use for her.</p>
<p>&#12288;Since she was an enemy soldier, I didn't have to worry too much about the people of the kingdom showing her any strange sympathy. In other words, I could experiment on her as much as I wanted. Okay, from now on, I'll call her my apprentice.</p>
<p>&#12300;What's your name?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Name it is? Elmaire, Elmaire ...... I'm sorry, I can't remember my family name.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, that's fine. Well, then, Elmaire, why don't you come with me until your memory returns? At the very least, I think I can guarantee you life and a place to sleep.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... I suppose so. I have nowhere else to go, so if it's not too much trouble, please take me with you.&#12301;</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12300;Good grief, what the hell are you thinking?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I had brought back the enemy soldiers with impunity and told Margarete about the movements of the Demon Empire based on Elmaire's memories, as promised, and once again she had to lecture me. Her reaction was predictable, so I decided to take it in stride this time.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry. But I need a lot of samples to examine the magic technology in this world.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Then you should have done as the other guy did! How could you come to such a conclusion as to bring back an enemy soldier as your apprentice!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;If it had been a man, I would have killed him, but my motto is that we should be somewhat gentle with women.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You impudent gentleman! Spare yourself such useless thoughts!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, well, well. No matter how much of an enemy she was, it's too heartless to take away a life he've already saved. In addition, it is said that she has lost her memory, so it is safe to assume that she is no longer the same person as the enemy soldiers who attacked us, isn't it?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Fairis-sama, but ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;If anything happens, Yard-sama and I will take responsibility, so let's just leave it at that, shall we? She's frightened too.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Fairis stepped in between us, as if she couldn't stand to see us talking like idiots.&nbsp;I'm not sure if Margarete can't take a strong stand against her, but she looks at me with a resentful expression.</p>
<p>&#12288;Elmaire, who was the center of the conversation, grabbed my clothes in fear, as if she sensed from the atmosphere that the princess was trying to kill her.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'll be a little more careful in the future.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, I would very much like that. If this kind of thing happens to us all the time, our nerves will be frayed.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When she finally said something sarcastic to me, she seemed to be done with the conversation and didn't want to continue it any further.</p>
<p>&#12300;Anyway, do all the magicians in the Empire look like this?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It was just the right time to change the subject, so I asked her about Elmaire.</p>
<p>&#12300;No, there are a good number of dark elves, but not all of them. Dark elves are good at using Demons and magic, so most of them are wizards. Is there something bothering you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;It seems that she is definitely a dark elf after all. I wanted to get a sample of a race other than human, but I still want to get a human sample first. I hadn't expected her to be a Dark Elf.</p>
<p>&#12300;Are there no others with a similar appearance in other countries?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;There are only Dark Elves in the Empire, but there are Elves in other countries as well, and there is an Elven nation in the north of our country. There are also a small number of elves living in our country.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I see. If there are other intelligent life forms besides humans, I would love to get some samples. There are still some procedures I want to try in Elmaire, and I think I can kill time for a while.</p>
