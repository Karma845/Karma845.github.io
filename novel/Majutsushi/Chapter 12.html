<h3>Chapter 12 &#8211; Mission Accomplished, Troubles Increase</h3>

<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>12.1</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;The next morning, I woke up without incident and woke Elle up before everyone else did, so that she could transfer back to the mansion with Lily, the woman from the hut. I'll just tell the rest of them some random reason.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I opened the hut, I found the two of them lying there in almost the same condition as yesterday. The only difference is that they were lying on top of each other yesterday, but today they were separated. I'm not sure if I'm the one to blame, but it looks like they've broken up.</p>
<p>&#12300;Well then, so this woman should be given the same treatment as Lucia, right?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, just throw her in the basement warehouse when you're done. You can only tell Tia about her, but don't tell anyone else about her. I'm sure Tia will handle it just fine.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;After briefly telling them how to handle her, I activate the magic circle. When the transfer was finished and the girls disappeared, the man who had been awakened by the light during the transfer was looking at us. The defiant gaze of yesterday has faded.</p>
<p>&#12300;.........What are you going to do with her?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;At best, she's an experimental mother. I'm sure that's how you treat a magician who has been defeated by the enemy.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;In a short while, she'll be in the same place as you. Until then, you'll have to wait.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I activated the magic circle I had been drawing as I spoke, and the man disappeared into dust with a &lt;Disintegration&gt;. I thought now that I should have at least collected the man's semen, but I'm sure I can get plenty of dark elves later.</p>
<p>&#12288;Speaking of which, I should get back to the capital and find Natalia's husband. Thinking about it made my stomach hurt. I've been getting into too much trouble lately.</p>
<p>&#12288;By the time I cleaned up the hut and left, the man's dust had been blown away and was gone.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;With the magic stone in place, I went to Elaine and give the nucleus to the other high elves that were left. It was kind of intimidating to be surrounded by all these beautiful high elves, but I was glad to see their naked bodies.</p>
<p>&#12288;High Elves are spirits, so they don't produce children like living things, but rather use their magic power to create similar individuals from one individual, like dividing a plant. Therefore, they only had the female form, just like Elaine. It was only natural that they were all originally created from a single individual.</p>
<p>&#12288;After the treatment was over, all the business in Leshiana was over. Alec, for example, seemed to miss his life in the capital and could not hide his joy at being able to return home. For someone who was used to living as an aristocrat, living here must have been very hard, but this guy didn't do anything again after all.</p>
<p>&#12288;Before we left, all the high elves came out to see us off. The rest of the elves could only watch from afar as the sudden event took place. They had never seen them before, so why did the elves immediately recognize them as high elves? Was it because of the atmosphere?</p>
<p>&#12288;The preparations were going well up to this point, but then Natalia said she was going to follow us again. I had a feeling that she would, but it seems that she won't stay in this forest.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'll definitely go with you. You're not going to leave me behind after all the time you've spent with me, are you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Elaine-dono, isn't it against the law for the elves here to leave the forest?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Right, we do not set that rule either, but if it is with you, it will be fine. I don't think she'd be willing to share her secrets against us. I'll leave her in your hands.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Oh, okay.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I knew you'd say that! I can't wait to see what the Yard's mansion looks like.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Natalia said with a smile, unaware of my hassle. It would have been better if Elaine had said no, but it seems that she misunderstood our relationship. I guess this is the part where she should sabotage Natalia out of jealousy. Now that my last hope was gone, I gave up and decided to take Natalia home.</p>
<p>&#12288;After lunch, we set off for the nearest town. Elaine had gone out of her way to open the road to the nearest town so that we could reach it quickly.</p>
<p>&#12288;After that, we met up with the coachman and leisurely swayed our way back to the royal capital.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;As soon as we returned to the capital, we had an audience. I left Alec and the others and took Lucia and Natalia with me as I left the castle.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I returned to the mansion, looking forward to taking a bath for the first time in a long time, I found out a rumor that I was an unparalleled elf lover in the royal capital. It was because I had taken the trouble to make Elle my apprentice, sent Lily, and brought back Natalia.</p>
<p>&#12288;Tia, for example, was wearing long fake ears to imitate the elves, and I told her to stop. I denied that it was a total misunderstanding, but I guess I wasn't convincing enough, and the rumor kept spreading.</p>
<p>&#12288;Even Sophie asked me about the rumor with tears in her eyes. Please don't do this to me.</p>
<p>&#12288;The next day, we were once again summoned by the king and given a reward of gold coins. The reward was larger than the one we received at the fortress, perhaps because the king didn't expect us to form an alliance.</p>
<p>&#12300;You have done well. With your work, the kingdom will no longer be frightened by the threat of the Demon Empire.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's a waste of words for us&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, I didn't get a chance to tell you before you left, but I was thinking of giving you a new title when you leave for Leshiana. In addition to that, based on the fact that the alliance was successfully concluded, Baron Gilflea will be given the title of Count, Associate Baron Werner will be given the title of Viscount, and Associate Baron Sagami will be given the title of Baron.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Ha, I shall remain loyal to your Majesty and the Kingdom of the Henrient.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm counting on you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As a formality, I was given the title before we left. This is probably because they thought that if Alec, the representative who went to make an alliance, was a baron, it might be taken as an insult to the other party. A Count would indeed be barely respectable as an ambassador of the country.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, I wondered why I was raised to two titles. I also asked Elaine to give all the credit for this negotiation to Alec.</p>
<p>&#12300;Oooh, Viscount Werner. You've received a letter of thanks from the High Elves representing Leshiana for another matter. I heard that you defeated the adventurers of the Demon Empire who tried to attack Leshiana. Now they owe us a favor. You've done well.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;That was mainly for me and Elle, but I'll take their gratitude in stride. However, if two titles are raised at once, will there be a need to change the residence? I'll ask about it later.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;The audience with the king was over, and I was now on my way to a certain store with Natalia. Both of us were wearing disguises this time to prevent our identities from being revealed.</p>
<p>&#12288;Based on the information I had gleaned from Sagami, we arrived at our destination. The place was a brothel, no matter how you looked at it. It was currently not open for business since it was daytime, but even so, I was not comfortable taking a woman into the place.</p>
<p>&#12288;However, I had heard that there was an elf who seemed to be her husband here, so I couldn't leave without seeing him. I had no choice but to knock on the door.</p>
<p>&#12288;A few moments later, a man came out from inside. He seemed to be not just an employee, judging from his good-looking clothes. I wondered if he was the manager or owner of this place.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, it's after hours.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I know. I came here because I heard that there is an elf called Levin here.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Oh, that's the guy? So you know the guy who came in last time?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's what it looks like. Can I see Levin?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yeah, sure. Some of the guys are sleeping, so don't make too much noise.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The guy who looked at me and Natalia and instantly recognized us as some kind of lovers' quarrel, gave me a disgusted look in return. I'm sure other people would punch me in the face like this.</p>
<p>&#12288;Anyway, I got permission, so I took Natalia and went into the brothel. She had never been in a place like this before, so she was looking around curiously.</p>
<p>&#12288;It was not business hours, so only a few people were cleaning inside. When our eyes met, I got a quizzical look, followed by a sympathetic glance. The only thing I can think of that would cause someone to come hereafter hours with a woman is a lover's quarrel, so I feel like it's a natural reaction.</p>
<p>&#12288;I asked for Levin's room and went to the one they told me about. I was told that I didn't have to knock, so I let Natalia wait outside the room and went straight in to find a single elf sleeping in what had been a single room.</p>
<p>&#12288;I wondered if it was popular to have a single room. An unpleasant image flashed through my mind for a moment, so I stopped thinking about it.</p>
<p>&#12300;Get up.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;......Hmm~, I think I'm still on break.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;The man woke up sleepily. He was a little worn out, but he still looked good enough to be an elf. He seemed to be Natalia's husband.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry about that. I need to talk to you about Natalia.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Natalia? Do you know her by any chance?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, I rescued her from bandits the other day. She's living a normal life now.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Is that true? Yeah, if you had come to save her a little earlier, I would have been saved too. Why didn't you come sooner?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It was an accident that I killed the bandits. We were actually supposed to pass by.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Then tell her. Tell her I'm here and I need her help.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;What the hell is this guy? It was an unexpected slight as if he didn't like me at all. I'm wondering how Natalia came to marry this guy.</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, I'll tell her that story. But I'm here today for something else.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;What?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I actually slept with her one night, knowing that she had a husband. My apologies.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I'll tell him I'm sorry as I bow my head. I thought I'd be prepared to take a beating, but when I looked up, wondering why there was no movement at all, he was looking at me with the same face as before.</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, then, you'll have to pay for her instead of me. And then we'll call it even.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Is that what you want? You're her husband, aren't you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's okay. I didn't get along with her very well, to begin with. I knew another man might have her. But if she was having an affair, I'd still have to get paid for it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I can't speak for others, but this guy is pretty much a scumbag. Well, if money can solve the problem, there's nothing better than that.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was about to take out the money I had prepared as compensation for him, Natalia came in the door, opening it vigorously. She was looking at him with an angry expression. Apparently, she had been listening by the door.</p>
<p>&#12288;He, too, was surprised and flustered by her sudden entrance and was trying to grasp the situation by alternately looking at me and her face.</p>
<p>&#12300;Levin! I had no idea you were such a lowlife!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Y-yaa, Natalia. I think there is a misunderstanding about what you said. Let's talk about it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I have nothing to talk about! You're an asshole! I'm divorcing you!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Wait, wait, wait. Yes, I've been worried about you, but I've been living like this for so long, I just got a little carried away. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Shut your mouth, you piece of shit! Yard, let's go! This guy should work here for the rest of his life!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Natalia ran straight out of the room. I wondered if it was a habit of hers to leave people alone and runoff. I stayed behind, looked at the stunned guy, and tapped him on the shoulder.</p>
<p>&#12300;Anyway, I'll pay you to get out of here for now. We'll deal with her later. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Eh, you're really going to give it to me? Thank you! In exchange, I'll leave you in charge of her!&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... I don't think you should decide that quickly.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't care, I'm more popular here as an elf than in a Leshiana, so I don't have much time for Natalia.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Well, I guess that's exactly what a lowlife is. If he's okay with it, so be it. Natalia doesn't seem to have any intention of making up with this guy, so I guess this is the end of the matter.</p>
<p>&#12288;On the way home, I paid the man who seemed to be the manager a while ago for his services and told him to let Levin go. The end was a bit more anticlimactic than I had expected, but that's okay.</p>
			
<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>12.2</strong></p>

<p>&#12288;I looked for Natalia but could not find her, so I decided to go back to the mansion first. As I came to the front of the house, I saw a familiar face at the gate. It was Fairis. There was a hint of anxiety in her expression as she looked at me.</p>
<p>&#12300;Fairis-dono, what can I do for you?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, I was looking for you. Yard-sama, are the rumors that have been circulating lately true?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Rumors?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Yes, it is said that Yard-sama has several elves around him and is playing around with them. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That is a total misunderstanding. Don't be fooled by such unreliable rumors.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;However, ...... there was a story that the church was going to judge Yard-sama for heresy. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I'm getting a headache from all this talk in no way. I indeed know a lot of elves, but it's not that I like elves. If I had to pick a favorite, I would have to say Tia over Natalia.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I asked her for more details, she told me that someone in the church had recently heard the rumor and started calling me a heretic. I don't remember joining the church in the first place, but in this world, it's believed that the better magicians are devout followers of God, so from the church's point of view, I'm a very devout follower.</p>
<p>&#12288;I wondered why the rumors were spreading so fast, even though it had only been a short time since I brought Natalia back. I don't think it's just because the people at the mansion are leaking information.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry. I also protested that Yard-sama is not such an unprincipled person, since you didn't touch me even though I was with Elmaire-san all the time. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No, the rumors had already begun to circulate when I returned from Leshiana. Maybe someone was trying to frame me. Is there any way I can talk to someone from the church?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't think you can meet them today or tomorrow. Everyone seems to be so busy.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh well, I'll just hide somewhere until then. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I'd better look into this matter as soon as possible. I parted ways with Fairis and asked Tia to gather some information on this matter. They may be seriously treating me like a heretic, but considering how fast the rumors are spreading, it's probably reasonable to assume that the church had a hand in this.</p>
<p>&#12288;Suddenly, I was curious about Natalia. Perhaps the church was reaching out to her as well. With that thought in mind, I turned back the way I had come.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;There was no one on the street who had seen her, so I looked for her in the back alleys, but even though it was daytime, there were many people who looked suspicious, and the atmosphere was not very good. I think it's a problem that such an unsafe place exists in the royal capital.</p>
<p>&#12288;I heard a familiar voice shouting in the distance. I hurried towards it and saw Natalia and a group of men fighting. She could fight better than most adventurers, but being attacked by several men in a not-so-wide alley was apparently no match for her. She was pinned down on the ground, her face already covered with scars as if she had been beaten.</p>
<p>&#12288;When I approached under her, I made the men fall into a coma with &lt;Fear&gt;, and when she realized that I had come, she stood up even though her whole body was injured all over. She seemed to have been assaulted all over, not just her face.</p>
<p>&#12288;I hurriedly applied an &lt;Major Heal&gt; to her. Gradually, her blood color improved and the scars all over her body disappeared, except for her clothes, which were not restored. I put on the robe I was wearing and she happily hugged me and kissed my cheek.</p>
<p>&#12300;Yard, I knew you would come for me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry, I should have come looking for you sooner. Anyway, do you have any idea who these people are?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Not that I know of. I was just walking along and all of a sudden they attacked me.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;When they were attacking her, they were looking around carefully, as if they were on the lookout for assassins. I was sure they weren't just a bunch of thugs, so I used the &lt;Memory Extraction&gt; to extract their memories.</p>
<p>&#12288;As a result, I found out that these guys are from the church, and that the man who gave the order is bishop Philpot. I didn't know why they were targeting her.</p>
<p>&#12300;So they don't like the idea of me and the Yard getting married?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Oi, wait a minute. I haven't said anything about getting married yet.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;You said you'd take responsibility.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;In the first place, Levin's response was worse than I expected. I didn't expect him to break up with you so easily. ......&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;It's outrageous to compare Yard to someone like that. You're always dashing in to save me when I'm being attacked.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;She's going to marry me, but if I'm going to marry her, I want to marry Tia. But since I've said something like that to Sophie, if I were to marry them, I'd have to choose Sophie as my legal wife first. There was no way that a maid or an elf could be the first wife without being royalty.</p>
<p>&#12288;Even if I was to take Natalia as my wife, she would have to be the third wife. The second wife would naturally be Tia.</p>
<p>&#12288;I returned to the mansion with Natalia, who had entered a world of her own imagination as if the fact that she had been attacked no longer mattered.</p>
			<p class="align-center">&#8251;</p>
			<p>&#12288;When I returned to the mansion, I found that Fairis was still there. I heard that Elle had invited her in, but I wanted to tell her not to be so selfish in someone's house. Well, I had something I wanted to ask her, so I'll tolerate her this time.</p>
<p>&#12300;Oh, Yard-sama, I'm sorry to disturb you. And that's Natalia, isn't it? It's nice to meet you. I'm Fairis, and I've been helping out at the church.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Natalia, she's one of the heroes.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;...... Oh, so you're a hero, too. I'm Natalia, nice to meet you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Natalia seemed to be wary of Fairis, who suddenly spoke to her, but when she realized that I knew her, she let her guard down.</p>
<p>&#12288;I asked Elle and the others to leave so that I could talk to Fairis. After watching Elle leave while talking with Natalia, I took a seat facing Fairis.</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry to barge in on you like this, Fairis-dono, but do you know a man named Philpot?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Uh, you mean Bishop Philpot? I believe he denied the rumors that Yard-sama was a heretic. What's wrong with him?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I just heard his name mentioned recently, so I thought I'd ask you.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Is that so? That person might be able to help us prove Yard-sama's innocence. Why don't you pay him a visit?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;I think Fairis's suggestion is a rather good one. It's probably not what she had in mind, but it would be faster to directly investigate the purpose of this time. The fact that they are taking a negative stance on the rumor after attacking people, no matter how you look at it, there's something behind it.</p>
<p>&#12300;Well, why don't I ask Fairis-dono to do the same? I don't even know if I can get into the church if I'm the party of rumors.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;That's fine. I'll let him know from my side, and I'll let you know when the date for the meeting is set.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I'm sorry.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;No problem. I've stayed too long, so I'll leave you here.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;Fairis rose from her seat and was led out of the room by the maid. After confirming this, I called out for Tia.</p>
<p>&#12300;What can I do for you, sir?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Do you have any information about Bishop Philpot?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Bishop Philpot, huh? He's a man who is the bishop of the church whereas Fairis-sama is the coadjutor bishop. He used to be a member of the Inquisition, and people around him regard him as a man of integrity.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Has he made any mistakes before, or have there been any incidents in the area he is in charge of?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;There are no bad rumors about the bishop himself or the church or diocese he serves. The people in town say that the area is relatively safer than other areas and that there are many devout followers.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;He was a more serious person than I had expected. So why was he attacking us? It's possible that the attackers mistook their employer for Philpot, but then I wouldn't know who the ringleader was.</p>
<p>&#12288;If this is the case, I should have brought one of the attackers with me. I was caught off guard by the ease with which their employer's name was given.</p>
<p>&#12300;Is there anyone suspicious approaching around Bishop Philpot?&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I don't know that much. I'll go and investigate right away.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;Investigation, I don't think it's necessary. ...... No, go ahead and do it.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12300;I understand. Then I'll look into it by tomorrow.&#12301;</p>
<p>&#12288;As I watched Tia leave the room, I thought about my future plans. For the time being, I think I'll build a secret basement in the garden until things cool down. It doesn't look very comfortable, but it can't be helped.</p>
<p>&#12288;I immediately went out to the garden and chose a place of appropriate size to build a basement. The strength of the basement has been forcibly increased with magic tools, so there is no need to worry about it collapsing in the event of an earthquake. When I brought in the furniture, it was like a secret base, and I got excited as if I were a child again.</p>
<p>&#12288;As I was doing such childish things, I received news that made things worse again.</p>
<p>&#12288;It seems that Fairis has been imprisoned for the crime of providing favors to heretics. This was turning out to be another troublesome situation.</p>
