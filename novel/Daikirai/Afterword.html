<h3>Afterword</h3>


<p>Finding out your own feelings is a terrifyingly difficult task. Killing off the wish or dream you had, wanting to be angry at someone or something without being able to, playing as the world demands it until eventually…your own feelings become vague. Eventually, your desires vanish to the point you can’t even feel the pain, and your heart turns empty. And if there was any hint for that, it’d be your body falling apart. Because the body is more honest than the mind.</p>



<p>As a child, you should be able to voice your wishes and desires with honesty. And yet, her thoughts and common sense were twisted and restrained, as she lost herself. Turned into a robot that only wishes for the good of others, she drowned inside the ocean of rules and regulations—And that’s why this new-found emotion is so precious.</p>



<p>In this volume, Akane is trying hard to fulfill the wish she finally found, but is unable to do so and struggles. She feels overwhelmed by this change in their relationship, unable to progress. Compared to Himari who had a clear mind on her feelings, Akane is much further behind. Though, she may have taken one important step before Saito, who is still unsure of the origin of his tears.</p>



<p>A great many people have helped me in bringing this book to you. My editor K-sama, N-sama, everyone from the MF Bunko J editorial department, and all the people who allowed and assisted the appearance of KuraKon at the summer festival. To my illustrator Narumi Nanami-sensei. Thank you very much for allowing such a detailed representation of my character’s feelings and thoughts, and breathing life into them like this. Next, Mosukonbu-sensei, who is working on the manga adaptation. Thank you very much for showing the characters in a new light that would have been impossible with just the novel adaptation. Even I, as the original creator, am always excited to read the next chapter.</p>



<p>And finally, to all the readers who picked up this volume. It’s thanks to you that I was allowed to bring out the sixth volume of this series in this harsh industry, so I have no words to convey my gratitude.</p>



<p>Their relationship may change, as their feelings find their destination, and I’d be happy if you continued to watch over them as you have thus far.</p>



<p>Amidst the hellish heat—</p>
