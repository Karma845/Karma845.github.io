<h3>Prologue</h3>


<p>When Akane was young, she’d often be alone at home. Upon arriving home, she’d grab the key to the front door from her backpack and enter inside.</p>



<p>“I’m home.”</p>



<p>She called out to the dark inside, but no voices returned an answer. Even so, she continued this ritual every single day without properly knowing why. The inside of her home was a bit chilly and uninviting, as she made her way up the stairs, towards her room, and placed her backpack on the floor. As Maho had yet again been hospitalized, her bed was neatly tidied up, showing no signs of life whatsoever. Only a cat plushie stood as its guardian.</p>



<p>—<em>I hope Maho feels better soon…</em></p>



<p>Akane finished her homework, prepared everything for the next day’s classes, and began working on chores. She did general cleaning, did the laundry, washed the dishes, and then went to clean the bath. Since her parents were incredibly busy, she had to do whatever she could to make their lives easier. Their parents said she didn’t have to go that far, but they were the ones keeping the family afloat, so Akane wanted to at least help when it came to household duties. She prepared curry for the day’s dinner, and right as she was busy cutting the vegetables for the salad, the phone rang.</p>



<p>—<em>Maybe it’s Mom? It could be that Maho’s getting discharged soon.</em></p>



<p>Filled with anticipation, Akane answered the phone.</p>



<p>“Yes, hello? This is Akane.”</p>



<p>‘Ah, Akane. I’m sorry, honey.’</p>



<p>Hearing her mother’s apologetic voice, all excitement vanished from Akane’s mind.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?” She asked, while already surmising her mother’s following words.</p>



<p>‘I have to take overtime again today. I think I’ll be late.’</p>



<p>“What about Dad?”</p>



<p>‘We both have overtime. And we’re going to visit Maho after work, too, so eat dinner without us.’</p>



<p>“&#8230;” Akane stared at the pot of curry in front of her.</p>



<p>This definitely wasn’t the amount a girl like her could eat all by herself. Since she barely got any time to spend with her family, she wanted to at least see the smiles of her parents as they’d eat dinner together, but that was a futile wish.</p>



<p>‘&#8230;Akane? What’s wrong?’</p>



<p>Her mother’s worried voice pulled Akane back to reality. She couldn’t afford to worry her already exhausted mother even further. Maho had been fighting a severe sickness since the day she was born, and to afford the hospital fees, her parents were working hard each and every day. Compared to all the suffering they went through, Akane’s own feelings weren’t anywhere close. She couldn’t tell her mother how sad and lonely she actually felt. Because that…would be nothing but selfishness.</p>



<p>“&#8230;I’m fine.” Akane just smiled and tightly gripped the phone.</p>
