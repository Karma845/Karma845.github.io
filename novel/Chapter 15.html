<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; Getting Stronger quickly in the Labyrinth’s Underground! ⑤</h3>


<p>Yeah!</p>

<p>It’s about time that the effects of my level up are showing.</p>
<p><em>Now that I think</em> <em>about</em> <em>it</em>…… A thought had been bugging me. I picked up a stone and…</p>

<p><em>Hmph!</em></p>

<p>I grabbed it as hard as I could.</p>
<p>(sfx sound of crumbling?), the stone crumbled.</p>

<p>I’ve suddenly remembered Cordelia had cut a big stone like it was tofu with a sword in the past……</p>

<p>Yes.</p>

<p>It seems like I’m almost venturing to the point where I stopped being human.</p>
<p>Actually, this is a dungeon for young dragons to train to become a full-fledged dragon.</p>

<p><em>–If I don’t stop being human…… there is no chance for me…… to capture this dungeon in the first place.</em></p>

<p>Looking at it from another point of view, this place is like a starting point.</p>

<p>「So…… after passing through the goblins’ farm(?), there will be an underground waterway.」</p>

<p>Walking through the limestone cave.</p>
<p>It felt comfortable walking in the slightly cool temperature with a small fire ignited.</p>

<p>And so, we had arrived at the underground waterway.</p>

<p>「This is……?」</p>

<p>It’s an underground lake about 50 metres wide.</p>
<p>And a huge mass that takes up half of the lake</p>

<p>I unintentionally held my breath.</p>

<p>「……A giant catfish?」</p>

<p>I nodded at Lilith’s comment.</p>

<p>「……Yes. A species that is very evil…… I think」</p>

<p>――鯨ナマズ (TN: A whale catfish????)</p>
<p>As the words suggest, this gigantic catfish was given this name because of its whale-like size. Currently, it is in its hibernation period, there is not even a ripple on the surface of the water.</p>
<p>By the way, according to literature, it will gobble everything when becomes active.</p>
<p>First of all, the catfish will use its barbels to block every lifeform that passes through.</p>
<p>Then, it will tie/roll its preys with its barbel and pull it into the water to eat/kill them.</p>
<p>Under the lake here is a huge groundwater passage that could connect with the outside world, so this catfish has a habit of making here as a den during hibernation.</p>

<p><em>……I’m going to ignore this thing. However you rephrase it, this catfish is just too gigantic.</em></p>

<p>Anyways, this catfish is about 25 metres in length.</p>

<p>For instance, this monster is a just a bit bigger in size……. it’s not within the parameter that I can do something about it.</p>

<p>「Oi Lilith?」</p>

<p>「……What?」</p>

<p>「How much water do we have left?」</p>

<p>Taking out a big leather bag, she opened it and look into the contents.</p>
<p>「We did not use more than 20%」</p>

<p>After thinking for a while, I took the rucksack from Lilith’s hands</p>

<p>「I want to refill it here, the path after this…… there is no place to obtain water.」</p>

<p>「……Eh? But the giant catfish……」</p>

<p>「It’ll be alright」</p>

<p>「And that is also from…… the skill: Wisdom?」</p>

<p>「Yes, once this thing is asleep…… don’t even say resisting, it can’t even move. And, this season is coincidentally its hibernation period」</p>

<p>「…… I oppose. That huge catfish……If anything happens, we will be wiped out in an instant」</p>

<p>「I’d say it’s okay, originally, that literature should be a survey……. from an institution that is reliable」</p>

<p><em>Fumu</em>…… Lilith reluctantly nodded her head.</p>

<p>「…… But…… I really hope that you remember this phrase」</p>

<p>「What is it?」</p>

<p>「……Be careful」</p>

<p><em>Such exaggeration</em>, I laughed bitterly and took the water bag.</p>

<p>Placing the mouth of the water bag on the water’s surface, water gushing in causing bubbles to float on top of the lake surface.</p>

<p>I bound the mouth with a string and place it aside.</p>

<p>And, I scoop the water with both hands and drank it.</p>
<p>It feels great drinking water at a cool temperature.</p>

<p><em>–Delicious.</em></p>

<p>「Oi, Lilith? Why don’t you come –」</p>

<p>When I turned back to call out for Lilith, there was something stuck in my throat</p>

<p>「Uoo!」</p>

<p>The water is gushing into the middle of the lake at a fast pace.</p>

<p><em>— The giant catfish? No, that is impossible……! In the literature, to hunt for food during hibernation is…… that kind of example was not stated……</em></p>

<p>While in panic mode, I turned my vision towards the water to see the situation.</p>

<p>And, <em>aa</em>, <em>I see</em>…… I accepted the harsh reality.</p>
<p>There was 3 metre length small catfish…… it should be the giant catfish’s son or wifey.</p>

<p>He, or she (TN: I love ‘it’ more but original context… so, no), is able to stock energy to endure hibernation, it hasn’t yet gone into hibernation.</p>

<p>It means that it needs to stock energy…… or a better word, gather food……</p>

<p>And I was stuck(?)/caught in its barbel.</p>

<p>I was then pulled into the water, a straight line towards its mouth.</p>

<p>Even an idiot will know to, the moment the catfish opened its mouth to swallow me– I took out the knife on my waist and landed an attack on its gum.</p>

<p>The binding of the barbel came off.</p>

<p>The moment I became free, I somehow move my arms in the manner of breaststroke.(?)</p>
<div id="novel_honbun" class="novel_view">
<p>As I ran away, I pierced both of the catfish’s eyes with my knife.</p>

</div>

<p>— And, I continued recklessly stabbing.</p>

<p>As long as my breath could hold, I continuously stabbing.</p>

<p>Seconds– turned into minutes.</p>
<p>It seems like it is possible to do this with the status of Physical Strengthening.</p>

<p>No, it might be purely just because of the effects my HP that is about 2000.</p>
<p>Anyways, in the 10 minutes in water, I recklessly pierced the catfish.</p>

<p>The lake coloured in blood(?), and a lone catfish– floated on the water surface.(?)</p>

<p>And finally, my breath has finally reached its limit.</p>
<p>I somehow swam with breaststroke arriving the shore(?) but……</p>

<p>While I faced(?) out of the water to take a deep breath– once again,  barbels tied around my neck.</p>

<p>It was a catfish different from the one before.</p>

<p>「Shit……! Oi, Lilith– Run! There are…… a few…… catfuglubbglub」</p>

<p>The last part doesn’t sounds like words at all.</p>

<p>–Haa, this is a bit…… not good</p>

<p>Following the lack of oxygen, my vision gradually became black.</p>

<p><em>Black out…… it’s not funny(?) in the water……</em> I thought though I couldn’t say anything.</p>

<p>I guess it’s over for me now.</p>
<div id="novel_honbun" class="novel_view">

<p>— Aa, now that I think about it…… just like in my second life came to an ending, I was tricked by the sage childhood friend…… I died in water.</p>

<p>That is not good.</p>

<p>I flashback on what had happened till now.<br />
<em><br />
</em></p>
</div>

<div id="novel_honbun" class="novel_view">
<p><i>No…… but…… as a villager…… I think…… I had…… did good…….</i><br />
<i><br />
</i></p>


<p>And, I closed my eyes and resolved myself.</p>
<p>And, at that moment–</p>

<p><i>—</i>My body ran through electricity(?).</p>

<p>At the same time, the bind of the barbel from the catfish came off.</p>

<p>My body became mobile, I took in the last of the oxygen and headed straight towards the</p>
<p>water surface.</p>

<p>I let my face out of the water and breathe deeply.</p>
<p>And– I was out of words.</p>

<p>Currently, there are two catfishes floating on the surface.</p>
<p>One of them was the one which I had damaged– and the other was one without any cuts</p>
<p>on it.</p>

<p>No, it’s is more accurate to say that the catfish on the water is making some static noice</p>
<p>and smokes.</p>
<p>And I looked towards the shore(?), I finally understood what had happened.</p>

<p>— That is a scenery(?) of Lilith carrying a rucksack, holding a staff.</p>
<p>I started swimming towards Lilith.</p>

<p>「Lilith, what…… did you do?」</p>

<p>「…… Electric shock. Your mana is inhuman…… after I thought that your resistance</p>
<p>towards magic is high, and I maxed the output(?)」</p>

<p>She responded with a tint of frustration in her words.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/YTYG9g9/default-11.jpg"></img>

<p>「…….It’s not something to be shocked about– it’s not like I lived here a few years for no reason. And…… I have a…… 3 lined bracelet…… I am at least able of support</p>
<p>Well, that would be the case…… the dragon culture does not accept the weak to live.」</p>

<p>If so….. Lilith is taught by her parent well.</p>

<p>「Then, may I say something?」</p>

<p>「What is it?」</p>

<p>「<i>……</i>Don’t decide everything by yourself」</p>

<p>「About what?」</p>

<p>「I cannot help you in this dungeon…… that is a fact」</p>

<p>「……?」</p>

<p>「……I’m sure that I’m not of help. This time, I coincidentally could support you but……</p>
<p>that is fine…… Don’t order to run. Don’t…… decide everything by yourself」</p>

<p>……I think I was told by Cordelia something similar that day.</p>
</div>


<div id="novel_honbun" class="novel_view">
<p>「I, in my own way…… can also support Lute. If luck and topography is with our side……</p>
<p>just like this time」</p>

<p>「That may be true. But…… I cannot…… put you in danger」</p>


<p>And I received a slap on my cheek</p>

<p>The slap reverberated in the dungeon.</p>
</div>

<div id="novel_honbun" class="novel_view">
<p>「……Then, What would be my position be if I put you in danger?」(EN: I’m not sure what</p>
<p>it means here. I’m going to assume it’s similar to “Then what would I do if you were to</p>
<p>die?”)</p>

<p>Tears began to form and Lilith continues to speak.</p>

<p>「Don’t…… selfishly decide everything by yourself. Don’t take all of the burdens upon</p>
<p>yourself……. What am I to Lute? Is my will reflected in Lute’s actions?」</p>

<p>I flashback on Cordelia’s words.</p>

<p><em>–Don’t selfishly decide everything on your own!</em></p>

<p><em>I didn’t wish for that. There isn’t my will in there.</em></p>

<p><em>–I’m not allowing you to go the Dragon Village! About not being able to see Lute for a few</em></p>
<p><em>years…… I never heard of that, I absolutely hate it!</em></p>

<p>I thought of that while laughing bitterly.</p>

<p>「…… What am I? Don’t selfishly put your life at stake. Don’t selfishly help me…… I’m just</p>
<p>another human」</p>

<p>「……」</p>

<p>「…… Sure I hate being a sex slave. I also hate that I’m being chased out of the Dragon</p>
<p>Residence. However…… just because of that, others have to risk their life…… if Lute</p>
<p>dies…… What should I do?」</p>

<p>I nodded my head and clenched my hands into a fist.</p>
<p>And I hit Lilith’s head softly.</p>

<p>「Then…… we will survive together?」</p>

<p>Lilith nodded her head.</p>
