<h3>Chapter 15 &#8211; 16 Crisis and Escape</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You're
just a bug. Isn't it disrespectful to keep me waiting?"</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
human adventurer Svalan had done his business and returned to his friend's
place - and a strange young Elven male is standing there.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">His
honey-blond hair is tied back, exposing his jewel-like green eyes and pointed
ears.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">His
face is so beautiful that he could have been mistaken for a woman.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In a
sense, he is a typical elven male standing there with a broad sword in his
hand.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gilbert,
the party member with whom Svalan had just been having a pleasant conversation,
is lying on the ground with his head severed from his body.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
young elf is stepping on Gilbert's head with his foot and waiting for Svalan's
return.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"....!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
he saw him, his blood rushed to his head and he wanted to shout out, but Svalan
is a veteran adventurer.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
is not the first time he had seen a fellow adventurer die without any proper reason.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
other party is an elf, and no matter how he looked at it, his opponent is stronger
than him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
he kept losing his cool, he would lose his life for sure.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Svalan
takes a breath, letting the cold night air cool his anger.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(Calm
down, calm down...)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He repeats
to himself, "Calm down," over and over again.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He looked
at the other party members sleeping in the tent, but their deaths are confirmed
by a large amount of red liquid flowing out of them.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
seems that Svalan is the only survivor at the moment.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(......
This place is surrounded by a shallow swamp. If someone were to approach on
foot, the sound of water would certainly alert us. However, Gilbert's head was
chopped off without any traces of a struggle.)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Calmly
making a decision, he lowers his hips and extends his right hand to his waist.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(The
opponent is a superior elf species who use magic.......If a human being like me
fights him head-on, I would surely lose. I can't fight him alone. I must report
this attack and murder of the adventurer to the adventurer's guild. If I do
that, the guild will organize a team to kill him. If I survive and report his
characteristics, race, and other details to the guild, I win! Don't think that
I can win with my own strength!)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
backed away from the young blond-haired elf, distancing himself from him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
blond-haired elf looks bored and clicked his tongue.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"This
is why I hate humans; they ignore me when I'm talking to them. Can't you at
least tell a funny joke?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"............"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Why
don't you say something? Even if you're the most inferior race, you should be
ashamed of yourself if you remain silent while your friends are being trampled."</span></p>
<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
kicks Gilbert's head.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Svalan
takes this opportunity to throw a smokescreen ball from his waist, his trump
card in case of emergency.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"!?
Smokescreen!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Are you planning to run away instead of
fighting! You're a fucking coward!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Shut
up, damned elf!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">I'll definitely take out my comrade's
enemy one day!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Blending
in with the white smoke that spreads from the explosion, Svalan commences his
escape.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(The
scary thing about magicians is that I have no idea what kind of tricks they have.
But they do have a weakness! Most of their offensive magic is useless if they
can't see their target. I'll run away from his magic range while the smoke
screen blinds him!)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Above
all, Svalan is a scout who calls himself the eyes and ears of his adventure party.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
also spent years fighting monsters in the third-level swamp. He knows where
everything is in this wide swamp.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He knows
where he can safely hide, where to find food, where to find water to drink.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">(I'm
going to escape from that damn elf for sure!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">And
make him pay for killing Gilbert and the others.)</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
felt a strong "thump" on his back.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
broad sword pierced from his back to his chest.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
immediately understands that it is the elf sword.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
sword blade had pierced halfway through Svalan's body.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
fatal wound.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
looked down at the sword, stained with his own blood.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Im,
impossible!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Gohoo! With the smokescreen, you shouldn't
be able to see my exact location......!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
he coughed out iron-smelling blood from his mouth, he screamed at the reality
he couldn't understand.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">If
this was some kind of offensive magic, it must be some kind of special
offensive magic that Svalan didn't know.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">But
it was an attack with a sword.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">How
could the elf pinpoint his position in the smokescreen and attack his back as
he ran away with his full strength?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
squeezed his strength and looked back.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">--But
the scene he sees there is different from what he had expected. At the same
time, he sees the reason why his enemy can hit him from behind, despite being
blinded by the smokescreen.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He understands
why a veteran adventurer like Gilbert was killed without a fight, even though
their surrounding area is a shallow swamp.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Ssh,
shit, tha....cheat, no way..."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Svalan
couldn't even finish his sentence before his consciousness was cut off.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Before
he could finish, his life drained away.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
kicks Svalan's body in disgust.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"You're
just livestock that can be killed to help me level up. How dare a bug like you give
me a hard time. It would be cute if they'd just stay quiet and let me kill
them, but they've got this weird little brain that makes these humans so
annoying."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
regains his mood and checks his status.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
Kaito's level did not rise.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
not going yet...... No choice. I guess I'll just have to keep killing people
until it goes up."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Then
he disappears from that place without a sound.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">All
that remained are the bodies of the cruelly murdered human adventurers.</span></p></div>
