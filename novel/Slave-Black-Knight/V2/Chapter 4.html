<p><strong><a style= "text-decoration:none;" href="">Chapter 1 &#8211; Charisma Party</a></strong></p>
<p>I was in front of the Guildmaster&#8217;s office for the face-to-face meeting of the Charisma party.</p> <p>I know I&#8217;m the last one with the presence of the four people I feel inside.</p> <p>I knock on the door, making a sound.</p> <p>I open the door as a faint voice comes back to me from inside, &#8220;Come in!”.</p><p>“I guess I&#8217;m late. Sorry, sorry.&#8221;</p><p>I greet them as I enter.</p> <p>At the far end of the room is an expensive-looking desk and chair that must have been custom-made for a young girl. Anyone who knows Riff can tell at a glance that it is for the exclusive use of the guild master.</p> <p>Riff was sitting in such a cozy chair with a carefree smile on her face.</p> <p>In front of Riff is a paired reception couch and a low black desk between them.</p> <div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 --> <div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div> <p>On one side were Soria and Fir, and on the other sat Yui, a beautiful dark-haired girl. She wears a military uniform and carries a dagger at her waist.</p> <p>She looks just like the photo.</p><p>“You’re not late. You’re just in time.”</p> <p>“No, let me say a few words, but Riff. Zeid is late. Making Soria-sama wait means he’s late.”</p> <p>“I,I don’t mind it, so……”</p><p>Soria glances at me, her face dyed with vermilion.</p> <p>Fir seems to have become even more irritated by this reaction.</p><p>“Nice to meet you, I&#8217;m Zeid.”</p><p>I head to one of the empty sofas.</p> <p>I sat down, saying hello to the previous guest who was sitting there.</p><p>“Yui”</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 --> <div data-fuse="22386378219"></div> </div><p>Without looking at me, while sipping tea on the black desk, the girl simply said her name.</p> <p>She is quite silent. And her facial muscles don&#8217;t move even a twitch.</p><p>“Alright, you’re all here. These are the people who will be the Charisma party. You will be working together more often in the future for the guild. So let&#8217;s have you get started with a big request――”</p> <p>“But first, let me ask you something, Riff.”</p><p>Fir raises her hand, interrupting Riff.</p> <p>Riff tilts her head without looking particularly offended.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p> <p>&#8220;There are members whose abilities I haven&#8217;t grasped yet. I would like to determine whether it’s okay for her to stay by Soria-sama&#8217;s side.”</p><p>Fir’s eyes were on Yui, who was right next to me as she said this.</p> <p>Yui puts the tea she was drinking on the black desk. She puts her attention directly to the dagger at her waist. Seems like her battle preparation is complete.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 --> <div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div> <p>Riff snapped her fingers together with a 『<em>yareyare</em>』 look on her face.</p> <p>In that moment ―― each fixture in the room is enveloped in a steel-like barrier.</p> <p>『Human』 like me and Soria are also being protected. It&#8217;s pretty advanced magic. If she doesn&#8217;t have top-notch spatial comprehension ability and magic power manipulation, it&#8217;s impossible to achieve.</p><p>&#8220;Rage as you like. But don&#8217;t leave the room.”</p> <p>““――――””</p><p>A moment with Riff&#8217;s permission.</p> <p>An intense swordfight ensues.</p> <p>Soria is looking at me in a daze『Hoee~』. It&#8217;s a normal response.<em> Rather, it can be said that they are accustomed to being watched.</em></p> <p><em> </em></p> <p>Dozens of sword flashes burst out in a second, leaving afterimages. The sound of iron clashing could be heard from all sides at the same time.</p> <p>An ordinary person would not even be able to follow them with their eyes.</p> <p>Suddenly, an afterimage passes in front of me. Soria&#8217;s eyes, which had been following them naturally, meet mine.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 --> <div data-fuse="22386378225"></div> </div> <p>“Hauh……!”</p><p>Leaving behind such riddling words, she turns away.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve been wondering about this for a long time, but I wonder if she’s being shy.</p> <p>I want to get familiar with her since we’re now a party.</p> <p><em>According to Fir, she seems to like me, so I&#8217;d be happy if we could get to know each other better.</em></p> <p>When I was thinking about this, the sound stopped.</p> <p>There was no winner, but it seemed that it has been completed to a satisfactory point.</p><p>“……you’re good”</p><p><em>Haahaa, </em>says Fir, breathing on her shoulder.</p> <p>On the other hand, Yui seems unconcerned and sits without opening her mouth.</p> <p>There&#8217;s a difference between a long sword and a short sword.</p> <p>The room was not small, but not large either. The reach of a weapon changes based on the spacing and movement. That’s the reason she got tired.</p> <p>It appears as a noticeable difference when they are competitive in terms of their ability.</p><p>“Don&#8217;t you have anything to say. From your point of view, there must be other members besides me whom you want to check their abilities.”</p><p>Fir asked, looking at Yui, who was unresponsive.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 --> <div data-fuse="22386378225"></div> </div> <p>Yui looks at me with a glimpse.</p> <p>Of course. Soria is not a fighter, so by the process of elimination, it leaves me.</p><p>“Zeid is for later”</p> <p>“What does that mean? I don&#8217;t understand why you&#8217;re just putting off Zeid.”</p> <p>“Just later. That’s all”</p><p>She dismisses Fir&#8217;s question with one remark.</p> <p>She has her own pace, but has a dreadfulness that can make anyone wonder if she whether consents or not.</p> <p>Fir also had a moment when her expression hardened in a miff, but she didn&#8217;t seem to want to pick a fight now that they were in the same party.</p> <p>It seems that she is indeed aware of what she was doing. <em>I wonder if it’s because of Soria not being involved.</em></p><p>“Well, it seems like things have settled down, so I guess it’s okay for me to talk about the main subject?”</p><p>Riff calls out to them when the place has quieted down.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 --> <div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div> <p>Soria looks politely at Riff and Fir follows suit.</p> <p>Yui drank her tea at her own pace, and I looked around at the surroundings before turning my attention to Riff.</p><p>“Promptly, as for what you guys are going to do as a Charisma Party――”</p><p>As she says this, Riff stands in front of us, placing a request form on the black desk with a bang.</p><p>“I’m thinking of asking you guys to accept this request――&#8221;</p><p>I look at the request form.</p> <p>Written on it was, 『Capture of the Largest Underground Dungeon, Ilbeck』.</p><p>&#8220;Oh, it’s Ilbeck, huh”</p><p>Soria says while holding her mouth.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 --> <div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div> <p>Fir next to me also had a difficult look on her face.</p><p>“As you know, it is an underground dungeon with an S-rank designation. It was built by the former Demon King Ran Ilbeck with the purpose of invading the human race.”</p> <p>“Hmm, what happened to that guy?”</p><p>I ask out of curiosity.</p> <p>I have heard that the labyrinth is still there, but that the demon king is no longer there.</p> <p>Then I was curious what the results were.</p><p>“He died after being demoted by one of the Seven Great Demon Aristocrats at the time. For that reason, the mighty monsters that he raised for his invasion are left alone to create their own ecosystems.”</p> <p>&#8220;Even now, the monsters that come out of Irbeck are still running amok&#8230;&#8230;was what I hear. Yes.”</p><p>Soria tells me as if making a just supplementary explanation.</p> <p>She seemed to be concerned about me, although our eye contact was still awkward.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div> <p>“I once saw a herd of A ranked earth dragons come out and destroy one city within the Holy Republic. At that time, Soria-sama and I managed to contain it, but the damage was enormous.”</p> <p>“Heh. This is in a human territory, huh”</p> <p>“Although the original 『entrance』 is in the demon territory, it could be said that it’s too big, and many intrusion routes have been found. Especially after the death of the Demon King Ran Irbeck, its concealment magic is no longer in effect.”</p> <p>&#8220;So, when will it be? This capture.”</p><p>Soria asks, raising her small hand.</p> <p>Besides, Riff announced a date and time that must have been decided in advance.</p><p>“According to your schedules, you will be free for the next three days.”</p> <p>“So the attack will start tomorrow?&#8221;</p> <p>“What are you talking about, Soria. It’s decided that it will be today.”</p><p>Well, I&#8217;m not surprised.</p> <p>It seems that the members also knew that she would say that, so their reaction was weak.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div> <p>&#8220;What the heck, I thought you were going to say 『Stop being so unreasonable!! 』”</p><p>Riff laughs in a mischievous way.</p> <p>Having said that, as far as I could see from the equipment of the members, it seems that some kind of notification had been received by them.</p> <p>They do not allow members who have come from remote places on an expeditionary level to suddenly accept a request without adequate preparation. By the way, I was told to come fully equipped too, but I can sleep outside with nothing on, and I have no problem fighting.</p><p>“Then we will move to Irbeck. I have called other adventurers and mercenaries over there.”</p> <p>&#8220;There are other people besides us?”</p> <p>“It&#8217;s a huge place for four people to challenge it. We have at least given it some consideration.”</p><p>Riff puts her fingers together as she says it.</p> <p>When she rubbed it together, a light clinking sound is heard and light floods the surrounding area.</p> <p>Just when I thought my vision had brightened ―――― the landscape changed in an instant.</p> <p>It was a prairie with not a tree in sight. A huge pit-like hole peeks out in front of us.</p> <p>Armed people surrounded us when we suddenly appeared.</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div> <p>There must be about 30 of them. All of them can be considered to be competent people.</p><p>“Umu, everyone has gathered.”</p><p>Riff looks around and nods.</p> <p>The armed people were probably adventurers or mercenaries that Riff had gathered.</p> <p>Some of them I had seen before.</p><p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s been a while, An-chan.&#8221;</p><p>It was an old man with thick body hair.</p> <p>It&#8217;s Didge, the one I hired to overthrow the Knights of the Kingdom of Kuzehra before.</p> <p>It&#8217;s been quite a while, but I believe he is an A-rank adventurer based in the Weira Empire.</p><p>&#8220;How have you been? Thanks for your help back then.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div> <p>&#8220;No, no, you wouldn&#8217;t have needed our help. Don&#8217;t give me that kind of flattery, the rumor of the S-rank-sama is all over the Weira empire! Gahahaha!”</p> <p>&#8220;Even if you call it a rumor, it&#8217;s just a bad story. I&#8217;ve heard it many times already.”</p><p>I am aware that I have made a pretty bad impression.</p> <p>That&#8217;s why I am getting a bad reputation. That is what I heard.</p><p>“Well, there are some strange rumors going around, but don&#8217;t worry about it. I&#8217;m told that the Empire’s military is pretty silly, it&#8217;s like there’s an ongoing disposition over there. Since there are a lot of confident guys in there”</p><p>Generously, Didge laughs it off.</p> <p>In the middle of such a conversation, Riff claps her hands with a <em>pah </em>to get everyone&#8217;s attention and focus.</p><p>“Then I&#8217;ll give you an overview of the strategy ―――”</p><p>The goal of the attack was quite simple.</p> <p>Secure the &#8220;magic item that causes the self-destruction of the dungeon&#8221; in the deepest part.</p> <p>The monsters that were left as it is are blocking the way, but there are such magic items in case we have to abandon the dungeon.</p> <p>However, the full extent of the dungeon is still not known and it has no map. Therefore, we will have to do the mapping manually.</p> <p>They had already confirmed the relay points by several survey teams, and all we had to do was simply break through the places that require strength to clear.</p> <p>So I ask with a little concern.</p><p>“Can&#8217;t we use detection magic and transference?”</p> <p>“It&#8217;s not no-good, but there are magic circles built into the dungeon that inhibit it.”</p><p><em>Heh. That’s well thought out.</em></p> <p>Let’s try to deploy detection magic to try it out.</p> <p>——Like the lapping of waves, as Riff says, if you send magic to a certain place, it will bounce back.</p> <p>Indeed, this is not the way to proceed.</p> <p>But.</p> <p>A question suddenly crossed my mind.</p><p><em>I wonder what would happen if I forced this magic power through?</em></p><p>There are several magic circles that were set up in order to send back magic power.</p> <p>When I send in magic power, the magic circle side sends back the same amount of magic power to offset the other side, which is me.</p> <p>I see. This is well done.</p> <p><em>But how about this?</em> I aim at the same spot over and over again, concentrating on that place.</p> <p>The magic power I am sending to the system can be stronger or weaker, wider or narrower――.</p> <p>……<em>Pishih.</em></p> <p>I felt like I heard such a sound.</p><p>“Ah”</p><p>I open my mouth without thinking.</p> <p>Riff gives a dubious expression.</p><p>“What’s wrong?”</p> <p>“No, it passed through”</p> <p>“What do you mean?”</p> <p>“My detection magic passed through.”</p> <p>“Hah?”</p><p>『What are you talking about?』 that&#8217;s the expression on her face.</p> <p>The people around me were looking at me quizzically, as if they couldn&#8217;t grasp what was going on.</p><p>“I was wondering if I could somehow break the magic circle that inhibits the magic, so I hit it with so much magic power that it couldn&#8217;t cancel it out and I was able to destroy it.”</p> <p>“Eah!? Do you even know the position of the magic circle!?”</p> <p>“To some extent. It&#8217;s cleverly hidden, but if you carefully explore the area where the detection magic bounces off, you can find it.”</p> <p>&#8220;Remotely like that&#8230;&#8230;. this magic circle is quite different from a magic item that&#8217;s easy to manipulate, you know? No, if you can remove the slavery collar, that’s possible &#8230;&#8230;!?”</p><p>Riff says with a ghastly appearance.</p> <p>Riff looks stunned and absentminded for a while, but then she comes to herself and looks me in the eye.</p><p>“Can the detection continue like this!? How far can it go!?”</p> <p>“There&#8217;s still plenty of room to spare, I&#8217;m still working on breaking down the magic circle.”</p><p>I don&#8217;t know how big it is.</p> <p>It has already progressed to the point where it lightly fills one forest.</p> <p>However, when you look at it this way, it is quite huge.</p> <p>The wriggling monsters in it were all of high rank, and there was also a hint of an unknown magic power.</p> <p>If such a thing goes out and gets out of control, it would indeed be troublesome.</p><p>“““……!”””</p><p>When I&#8217;m deep in thought, I notice the surroundings being silent.</p> <p>In the meantime, I ask Riff.</p><p>&#8220;Do you have any idea how big it is, even if it’s a little bit?”</p> <p>“……right now, how much do you know?”</p> <p>“Err. I just passed through a space with thirteen forkings. Eight of them seem to be dead ends, though.”</p> <p>“No one has advanced to that point! We have no idea what the whole picture is&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;ll leave it to you now. Let me know when you reach the target!”</p><p>Riff says in desperation.</p> <p>Well, now it&#8217;s just a matter of waiting for the detection magic to spread.</p> <p>Then after a while.</p> <p>Finally, I reached the last dead end.</p> <p>It was a large space.</p> <p>The place looks like an altar, with a round object placed on the central platform. It is probably the crystal.</p> <p>The crystal is a magic item that is magically connected to various parts of the dungeon.</p><p>“Maybe this is the deepest part. Let me just take a quick transfer.”</p> <p>“Yo,you can go!?”</p> <p>“Ah, I&#8217;ll be right back.”</p><p>I was about to say &#8220;transfer&#8221;, but my hem was held up.</p> <p>I looked and saw that Yui was holding it.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m going too&#8221;</p> <p>“I’ll just go and come back, you know?”</p> <p>&#8220;Just in case”</p><p>Yui says, as if pushing through.</p> <p>It seems unnatural, but I don&#8217;t see the point in wasting time rejecting it here.</p><p>“The,thethethe,then I too!”</p> <p>“If Soria-sama is going, then I will accompany her.”</p><p>It looks like Soria and Fir are also coming along.</p> <p>Yui, however, turns an emotionless eye on the two of them.</p><p>“I don&#8217;t need you&#8221;</p> <p>“Nah, you bastard, did you just tell Soria-sama you 『don’t need』 her!?”</p> <p>&#8220;It’s a waste of magic power. Besides, what if Zeid and I can&#8217;t go outside?”</p><p>It’s like she’s saying that they’ll be the ones who’ll come pick us up.</p><p>“……Tch. Even so, there must be something called choice of words.”</p> <p>“We,well well. I don’t mind it”</p><p>A flash of light. Fir is about to draw her sword. <em>It was quite a close call</em>.</p> <p><em>Is this what a party is like?</em> I can&#8217;t say anything about it, as I don&#8217;t know about the others.</p> <p>I have formed a party with Quena, Sheila, and Sufi, but we have not taken a single request yet. Even so, we usually never get into such an insecure atmosphere.</p><p>“Well, we’re off then. Transfer.”</p><p>I took Yui and moved to the space I found.</p> <p>The scenery changes with a light turn.</p> <p>Several magic items resembling torches are set up on the four walls. It still operates on magic power, and although the area is only dimly lit, its visibility is good.</p> <p>The size is also spacious, as I previously confirmed.</p> <p>It is large enough to accommodate a hundred people with room to spare. Its ceiling is about three meters high.</p> <p>The central altar was made of wood, with a green crystal on top that glowed suspiciously.</p><p>“This is it, the magic item of self-destruct.”</p><p>There is no sign of monsters around.</p> <p>There is a luxurious door on one wall, and although I have detected the presence of several monsters from behind it, there is no sign of them coming in this direction.</p> <p>I heard the sound of blade leaving its scabbard.</p> <p><em>She said </em><em>『</em><em>need to</em><em>』</em><em> in order to test me, huh?</em> While doubting the true meaning of her words, I bend my index finger and place its tip on my thumb.</p> <p>It&#8217;s the so-called finger flick on the forehead.</p> <p>I bring my fingertips towards Yui.</p><p>&#8220;Well, I don&#8217;t particularly mind. But you’ve said it, so endure it.”</p> <p>“?&#8230;&#8230; don’t screw around ―――”</p><p>She was about to say something, but Yui turned her face away as fast as she could.</p> <p>The finger that cut the air resounds a roar.</p> <p>A heavy sound unsuitable for light movements must have rang in Yui&#8217;s ear.</p> <p>Yui&#8217;s short hair was blowing in the wind as a proof. Her hair, which had failed to escape, was slammed against the wall with the wind.</p><p>“This…… is!?”</p> <p>&#8220;It was an attack. A simple one”</p> <p>&#8220;Magic &#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p> <p>“I have used magic. It&#8217;s magic, and also a melee skill.”</p> <p>“……it isn’t magic? But this power”</p><p>Yui ponders.</p> <p>She seems to be ruminating over what happened with her fingertips on her chin.</p> <p>She still couldn&#8217;t seem to find the answer and made eye contact with me.</p> <p>They are the eyes of one in search of strength.</p><p>“How does it work? Clearly, it has the power beyond the inhuman.”</p><p>Yui, who has become more talkative than when we first met, looks up slightly and asks me a question with a happy expression on her face.</p><p>“Before we go any further, let me ask you something. Obviously, this is too much of a test for a party member&#8217;s strength. What is this all about?”</p> <p>“……”</p><p>Yui becomes quieter, a change from earlier.</p><p>“If you can&#8217;t answer the question, then that&#8217;s okay. Let’s just get the crystal and go back――”</p> <p>“……”</p><p>I turned around and tried to get the magic item, but Yui bumped into my back.</p> <p>It was sudden, but there was no hostility, so I didn&#8217;t force myself to avoid it.</p> <p>There is nothing wrong with my body.</p><p>“What are you doing”</p><p>I twisted my head around and looked back to see Yui closely on my back.</p> <p>I was being hugged.</p><p>“I&#8217;ll seduce you.&#8221;</p> <p>“What are you saying?&#8221;</p> <p>“I&#8217;m going to honey trap you.&#8221;</p> <p>“That’s discomforting, but it&#8217;s a wording that I can somehow comprehend…&#8230;”</p><p>I understand her objective.</p> <p>And I have an idea why.</p><p>“It’s by the will of the empire, you mean”</p> <p>“Hmm”</p><p>A short answer.</p> <p>At the same time, while shaking her body, she uses her feminine parts lewdly, stirring up my lust ――.</p> <p>In the past, I would have been too surprised and stunned to think straight.</p> <p>But I&#8217;m different now.</p> <p>I was trained by Sheila(?). It hardly works on me due to the female body resistance I have developed. <em>No, it works a little.</em> <em>No, no, actually, it&#8217;s working very well.</em></p> <p><em> </em></p> <p>“As Ruina-sama said, 『I don&#8217;t mind if you have to use your body to make a cage! Just make him fall! 』.”</p> <p>“……Are you serious?”</p><p>Yui imitates a less spirited Ruina.</p> <p>The other side of that phrase may mean, 『I don&#8217;t care what means you use』, but Yui, clumsy as she may be, does it honestly with simply her body.</p><p>“If you come to the empire, I will do anything. I don&#8217;t have any experience in this kind of thing, but you can do whatever you want.”</p><p><em>Muni, </em>I feel the soft and large twin mounds pressing against me that I can feel even through the thick military uniform.</p> <p><em>She’ll…… do anything?</em></p> <p>This is ridiculous. Impossible. Why has my heart been shaken so much by a single remark?</p> <p>I thought I had acquired resistance thanks to Sheila&#8230;&#8230;!</p> <p>In my brain, Sheila&#8217;s boobs with two words 『Reason』 painted on either side of them and Yui&#8217;s boobs with 『Erotic』 on them are colliding with each other&#8230;&#8230;!</p><p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0951-729x1024.jpg" alt="" width="729" height="1024" /></p><p><em>Hang in there Sheila!</em></p> <p><em>Let me win! Let my reason win!</em></p> <p>No, wait.</p> <p><em>On second thought, aren&#8217;t they both boobs!?</em></p> <p>Even if Sheila wins, I&#8217;ll still succumb to Sheila&#8217;s boobs!</p> <p><em>It’s no good.</em></p> <p>Don&#8217;t think about it anymore.</p> <p>I calm the lower half of my body.</p> <p>Thinking so…… it’s one of the goblin’s <em>plot</em>. <em>(TN: instead of saying p*nis, I wrote plot since it reads the same in Japanese)</em></p> <p>It stands tall and proud like a raised arm!</p> <p>A man&#8217;s weapon that shows off its glittering, brilliant eyes with a smug smile &#8230;&#8230;!</p> <p><em>Goblin&#8217;s p</em><em>〇</em><em>nis</em></p> <p><em>Goblin&#8217;s p</em><em>〇</em><em>nis</em></p> <p><em>Goblin&#8217;s p</em><em>〇</em><em>nis</em></p> <p>Ah…… it calmed down.</p> <p>I had my own silly imagination, but&#8230;&#8230;</p> <p>Now&#8217;s my chance!</p><p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;I have no intention of going to the Empire. There was also the matter of them trying to invade the Holy Republic using the Hero Association. I don&#8217;t have a good impression of them.”</p> <p>“Because one has no power, they perish; because one has power, they flourish. That is the way of the world.”</p><p>I push Yui away.</p> <p>I saw an organization that has broken down in its quest for power. It’s the Knights of Kuzehra.</p> <p>I also saw an organization that have collapsed by drowning in power. It’s the Hero Association.</p> <p>The way the empire is going seems like a quagmire to me now.</p> <p><em>If you had power, you will not perish?</em></p> <p><em>If you had power, you will flourish?</em></p> <p>I was only feeling discomfort in Yui’s words.</p><p>“At least I&#8217;m not interested in the empire. And we’re in the middle of a commission. Don&#8217;t do anything more.&#8221;</p><p>Once again, I pick up the magic item crystal.</p> <p>When I managed to refuse, Yui remained motionless without changing her expression.</p><p>“I understand now. But this is also part of my mission.”</p> <p>“……Oh”</p><p>In other words, she won&#8217;t give up.</p> <p>Even though I had a bad feeling about it, I thought I shouldn&#8217;t give in to the temptation, so I mouthed the word &#8220;transfer”.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p><p>After another brightening, Soria appeared in front of me with a worried look on her face.</p><p>“We,welcome back. Are you injured!?”</p> <p>“Ah, no I’m not.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad……&#8221;</p> <p>“Muh, Zeid. Is that the magic item for self-destruction?”</p><p>After Soria, Riff called out to me. She was looking at the crystal I held in my hand as if she were devouring it.</p> <p>She seems to be exploring its flow of magic power in her own way.</p><p>“Ah, I&#8217;m pretty sure that&#8217;s it. It&#8217;s the one that will probably break what I would call a pillar in the ground. If you use it, it could change the terrain of the human&#8217;s territory greatly, not just in these areas.”</p> <p>“Hou. But you have the whole picture, right? Can you make a map for me?”</p><p>Riff unfolded a rolled-up map of the continent and a blank sheet of paper, and finally, produced a pen.</p> <p>I suppose she is asking me to write down the entire dungeon here.</p><p>“This is another troublesome job”</p> <p>“We have to stop the damage when it destroys itself. Only then will it become an achievement.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Are we going to do damage control, too?&#8221;</p> <p>“No, we&#8217;ll take it from there. I won&#8217;t make you do that much hard work, you know.”</p> <p>“I see. But the mapping is too big and complicated, so I can&#8217;t draw it here. I&#8217;ll draw it when I get home.”</p> <p>“Is it that much? Well, that’s fine. Then, for the time being, we&#8217;re disbanding for today.”</p><p>One word from Riff and I can feel a disheartening aura of 『Good grief』 from the people in the surroundings.</p> <p>Didge approached me.</p><p>“In the end, if you were here, we wouldn&#8217;t be needed.”</p><p>It was a mixture of a wry smile and a sigh.</p> <p>Riff makes an apologetic look.</p><p>“I’m sorry, everyone.”</p> <p>“No, no one needs to apologize. Zeid is just too unexpected.”</p><p>Didge&#8217;s follow-up was tinged with a half-hearted resignation.</p> <p>I feel fiercely guilty when I hear that.</p><p>“……Somehow, I’m sorry”</p> <p>“You’re saying stupid things. We&#8217;re the ones who should be apologizing the most. I’m sorry we couldn&#8217;t do anything for you!”</p><p>When I looked at them, everyone seemed to be feeling unmotivated.</p> <p>Ah, I see――</p><p>“Then can you help me with the mapping? I don&#8217;t think I can finish this myself by the end of the day. Besides, it will be a pain in the ass because I have to draw it accurately.”</p> <p>“Oh! Is that so! I&#8217;ll help you if you&#8217;re okay with me!”</p> <p>&#8220;Me too! I have a few days off for this request. If you don&#8217;t let me work for the money, then I don&#8217;t even want to receive it!”</p> <p>“It would be nice if I don&#8217;t have to work and I get paid, but &#8230;&#8230; well, I&#8217;ll go with the flow.”</p><p>Like so, the adventurers who had been summoned rode with us.</p> <p>Among them were Soria and Fir. Yui had disappeared after taking one look at us.</p><p>“Kufufu. it&#8217;s a glimpse of the 『Charisma』”</p><p>Seeing us like that, Riff was smiling somewhat happily.</p><p style= "text-align:center;"></p><p>The big job of mapping was done, and all that remained was for Riff and the others to take measures to prevent the self-destruction.</p> <p>Some time after that, I joined Quena and Sheila.</p> <p>Our purpose is to carry out activities as a party and to perform requests.</p> <p>We enter a large forest and defeat a pack of A-rank monsters, Tear Wolves, which have recently been attacking villages.</p><p>“Fuh. With this, it’s finished!”</p> <p>“Well, I guess that&#8217;s about it.”</p><p>Sheila wiped the sweat from her forehead, giving the feeling that she had finished the job, and took down the last one on her side.</p> <p>Next to her, Quena has also defeated about the same number of Tear Wolves.</p><p>&#8220;You’ve really raised your skills before I saw you again.”</p> <p>“……I don&#8217;t even know if you&#8217;ve gotten stronger no matter when I look at you.”</p><p>Quena said, looking disgustedly at the carcasses of the Tear Wolves piled up behind me.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s at a level where you can get change even if the amount of mine and Queena were to be combined. As expected of Zeid!”</p> <p>“You don’t need to flatter us. Rather, if the number of our subjugation is not the same, we won&#8217;t be able to stand up to you.”</p> <p>“Well, but with this, didn’t we beat the Charisma Party!?”</p><p>Sheila says with a cheerful smile.</p> <p>Quena nodded, as if she was not wholly satisfied.</p> <p>They defeated a group of A-rank monsters. This is an S rank request.</p> <p>From the point of view of the girls who see the Charisma party as rivals, it would be a very good achievement.</p> <p>In the middle of this, the guild card beeps.</p> <p>When I took it out, I found that it had been updated with an article labeled 【Emergency Bulletin】.</p> <p>The content was ――.</p><p>“The underground dungeon Irbeck has been conquered!?&#8221;</p> <p>“Eh, are you kidding! Quena, what kind of party did that ……………………”</p><p>Quena has taken out her card and Sheila peeks out at it from behind her.</p> <p>They must have seen the article.</p> <p>The two looked at the card in amazement for a while, then turned their heads awkwardly and looked at me.</p><p>“They have used the magic item for self-destruction, huh. That was quick.”</p><p>I&#8217;m also surprised at how quickly they acted.</p> <p><em>I wonder if they have formulated a plan to deal with it ahead of time.</em></p><p>“What that hell is that! I haven&#8217;t heard of it, Zeid! Speaking of Ilbeck, it is one of the largest dungeons with an S-rank designation, and every year it causes a lot of damage!”</p> <p>“Look, I told you, we are in a dilemma. That is the place we’re in.”</p><p>Sheila was half excited, followed by Queena as if to reprimand her.</p><p>“My bad. I had to keep my mouth shut about the aforementioned attack.”</p><p>Sheila, who had just been breathing hard after defeating a pack of Tear wolves, collapsed to her knees and fell into a heap. <em>She&#8217;s easy to understand.</em></p><p>“Thi,this is the Charisma Party, huh&#8230;&#8230;”</p><p>Even though it&#8217;s the charisma party, I&#8217;m the one who took the magic item of self-destruction.</p> <p>Though I did ask for help in dealing with it afterward and mapping it out.</p> <p>Well, let&#8217;s keep quiet about that.</p> <p>It would be a good stimulus for Quena and Sheila. And it would be better for the guild to keep it as an achievement of the charisma party from an external point of view.</p> <p>However, it seems that the guild was making a conjecture for me, and the four letters &#8220;Zeid&#8221; appeared prominently in the article.</p><p>“This can&#8217;t go on like this&#8230;&#8230;.! It&#8217;s only going to make more and more difference. &#8230;&#8230;!”</p><p>Sheila says while clinging tightly to Quena.</p> <p>Quena lowers one eyebrow in exasperation.</p><p>&#8220;But you&#8217;ll just kill yourself if you rush for success, you know.”</p> <p>&#8220;Strategy meeting! Yes! Let&#8217;s have a strategy meeting! In the room where Zeid is staying!”</p><p>Sheila&#8217;s eyes lit up.</p><p>“That&#8217;s, just what you want to do.”</p> <p>“I need comfort! Let&#8217;s have a strategy meeting!”</p><p><em>Uwaan, </em>Sheila pleads with her hands together with teary eyes.</p> <p>……What a very restless fellow.</p><p>“I don&#8217;t know what we&#8217;re going to talk about in the strategy meeting, but I don&#8217;t mind.”</p> <p>“Really! Are you sure!?”</p><p>When I said that, a smile blooms like a flower on her.</p><p>“You&#8217;re in tune, heh……”</p><p>Half astonished, half accustomed, Quena represented my feelings.</p><p style= "text-align:center;"></p><p>“Oh, this is the inn where Zeid is staying&#8230;&#8230;! It&#8217;s even nicer on the inside than it is on the outside, where I first viewed.”</p> <p>“Wait, what do you mean by <em>first viewed</em>?&#8221;</p><p>Sheila said a disturbing and unjust word.</p> <p>However, she was not trying to answer the question and was laughing it off with an <em>ah-ha</em> laugh. <em>From now on, I guess I will always have to use spatial comprehension magic&#8230;&#8230;.</em></p> <p>The room has one single bed, one closet, one bathroom and toilet, and one chair and table.</p> <p>The room in which I was staying is the one in which it was placed in a cramped space.</p><p>“Hey, hey, why don&#8217;t you buy a house too, Zeid?&#8221;</p> <p>“You didn&#8217;t buy a house either, you just stayed with me.”</p><p>Sheila&#8217;s question was quipped by Quena.</p> <p>These girls lived together huh.</p><p>“A house, huh? I&#8217;ve been thinking about buying one, but all the housework and tax stuff was a bit annoying for me.&#8221;</p><p>The inn will be cleaned on its own, and meals can be arranged.</p> <p>If anything, if I go outside, there are stalls and places to eat, so there is no need to go to the trouble of making it.</p> <p>Taxes may be charged when buying or selling something or for intermediary fees for guild requests, but if you stay at an inn, you do not have to pay any residence taxes.</p><p>“Then why don&#8217;t you hire me for life? I&#8217;ve learned how to manage my taxes, you know?”</p> <p>&#8220;Stop appealing when you have a chance, Zeid, don&#8217;t make any openings either.”</p> <p>“Eh, I am in the wrong?”</p> <p>“You’re saying such a thing. Though Quena wants to appeal to Zeid, too, right~?”</p> <p>“Wha,what the hell are you talking about!? Eh, no, stop making your hands have an itching-to-grab gesture!”</p> <p>“Nufufu~, Sheila can&#8217;t stop herself from getting addicted to the feel of Quena!”</p><p>They began to intertwine with such conversation.</p> <p><em>Where did the strategy meeting go?</em></p> <p>But I think I&#8217;m seeing how friendly the atmosphere they have.</p> <p>This feels more like a 『party』 than the somewhat business-like relationship that the Charisma party have.</p> <p>Well, that&#8217;s just a matter of my sensitivity.</p><p>“―――Mumu. I have a feeling that Zeid is thinking of another woman.&#8221;</p><p>Sheila makes an accurate point.</p> <p>For a moment, I even wondered if she had used some kind of magic to read my thoughts.</p><p>&#8220;Let&#8217;s talk about the strategy meeting instead of that.&#8221;</p> <p>“What are you taking about! To me, that’s not the issue!”</p> <p>&#8220;What did you come here for then…&#8230;”</p><p>Sheila approaches me with puffed out cheeks.</p> <p>Unusually, Quena did not admonish her. She simply looked tired of tangling with Sheila and seemed to be listening somewhat.</p><p>“Zeid, are you thinking of a woman?”</p><p>Suddenly, Sheila asked.</p> <p>By thinking of a woman, I assume she means a lover relationship.</p><p>&#8220;There&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s possible, you know&#8221;</p> <p>“You’re lying! I know you have one! While we’re doing this, someone who had a relationship with Zeid is going to knock on the door to see him――”</p><p><em>Knock, knock,</em></p> <p><em> </em></p> <p>Sheila&#8217;s words and the knock on the door of the room simultaneously came.</p> <p>It&#8217;s a coincidence on an impossible level.</p> <p>Everyone in the room gasped.</p> <p>Sheila has a sweat on her forehead.</p><p>“No, eh, I was just kidding.”</p> <p>“…….Wait. There&#8217;s no way I have a guest. It&#8217;s the lady from the inn, she must have come to clean up.”</p><p>For some reason, the atmosphere became strange, but she often came here to clean.</p> <p>They would dust the floors and change the sheets on the beds.</p> <p>Knocking to make sure there are no people would be the norm.</p> <p><em>I guess her throat is sore because she doesn&#8217;t say her usual cheery </em><em>『</em><em>I&#8217;ve come to clean your room! </em><em>』</em><em>.</em></p> <p>I&#8217;m sure it is.</p> <p>With this in mind, I open the door.</p> <p>A beautiful, dark-haired, bobbed-head style girl –– Yui, was there.</p><p>“……”</p> <p>“……”</p><p>I couldn&#8217;t speak to her, and Yui was still standing there, silent as ever.</p><p>“It hasn’t even been a few days since the party started, but…… have you already put your hands on her!?”</p><p>Sheila&#8217;s frank and loud voice occupied the place.</p><p>“I’m coming in”</p><p>Yui said bluntly. She went inside the room and sat on the bed.</p> <p>Sheila is glaring at me, and Quena is sitting in a chair next to her.</p> <p>I was leaning against the wall while looking at the state of the room.</p> <p>Sheila says the first thing in the heavy air.</p><p>&#8220;I am the legal wife.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;Wait, what are you talking about?&#8221;</p><p>I heard a conversation that suddenly made me befuddled.</p> <p><em>I think Sheila is starting to go off the rails as much as that Fir.</em></p> <p><em>Are knights just a bunch of no-goods?</em></p> <p>Yui looked at Sheila with an uninterested sideways glance.</p><p>“……And?”</p> <p>“Muki! That composure is pissing me off! I just had my breasts squeezed by Zeid, you know!?”</p> <p>“Wait, you made me touch you, right.”</p><p>Before I know it, her memory has been tampered with.</p> <p>Even if it is to go above from Yui, it is indeed upsetting that I am being treated like an assailant.</p><p>“&#8230;&#8230; I also made contact with Zeid&#8217;s body.”</p><p>As if to stir up her state of mind, Yui said that.</p> <p><em>I&#8217;m screwed.</em></p> <p>The distortion of her speech is too severe.</p><p>“Ha,haaaa!? Zeid! Were you just playing with me!?”</p> <p>“I&#8217;m innocent&#8230;&#8230;.”</p><p>I no longer have any energy left to argue.</p> <p><em>I feel more tired just now than when I worked full time for a month. &#8230;&#8230;</em></p><p>“So, what are you here for?”</p><p>Quena asked Yui.</p> <p>She exudes an aura of hostility.</p><p>“It’s the continuation of me and Zeid in the dungeon”</p><p>Sheila&#8217;s eyes widen.</p> <p>She came to a single man&#8217;s room and said these words.</p> <p>Those were brief words, but perhaps it has more than enough material for a misunderstanding.</p> <p>No, there’s no misunderstanding or crap &#8230;&#8230;. From my point of view, it&#8217;s just a misleading and I&#8217;m the victim. &#8230;&#8230;</p> <p>Quena continued asking.</p><p>“What do you mean by &#8220;continuation&#8221;? What are you here for?”</p> <p>“Hmm?”</p><p>Yui spreads her hands wide toward me.</p> <p><em>Come here, </em>as if she’s saying so.</p> <p>Sheila and Quena guessed it by that gesture. Quena got between me and Yui.</p> <p>Sheila looked at Quena, who reacted more quickly than she did, in surprise.</p><p>“What”</p> <p>“&#8230;&#8230; That&#8217;s my line. Is that what Zeid wants?”</p><p>Quena said so, while glaring at Yui.</p> <p>Oh, Sheila would have misunderstood and ranted about it, but it was as I expected from Quena. She realized at once that Yui was trying to seduce me one way or another.</p><p>“That&#8217;s not for me to say.&#8221;</p> <p>“……Tuh, That’s right. How is it, Zeid?”</p><p>Quena looks at me.</p> <p>Her eyes are somewhat uneasy. Perhaps it was because Yui had so far snatched what she wanted right in front of her eyes. She’s the kind of woman who was recognized by the empire and became an S rank.</p> <p>This time, she wants even me, her party member――― so she became worried.</p><p>“Well, I think anyone would be happy to be approached by a beautiful girl. If it&#8217;s a sin to want it, I don&#8217;t mind being sentenced to life in prison.”</p><p>These are my honest words.</p><p>“―――Then am I no good&#8230;&#8230;?”</p><p>Quena&#8217;s face burns with embarrassment, and her eyes become wet with a torrent of water.</p> <p>A beautiful woman with a body that arouses lust &#8230;&#8230; <em>How could she be no good?</em></p> <p>But let’s not do it here.</p><p>&#8220;Quena scored over 100,000,000 points. But haven’t you lost sight of your purpose? It should be your goal to make Ruina look back at you.”</p> <p>“But, I ――!”</p> <p>“I don&#8217;t think I can do it today. I&#8217;ll come back on another day.”</p><p>Yui covered Quena with words and got up from the bed.</p> <p>She was just at her own pace still.</p> <p>However, before leaving the room, she glanced at Quena and Sheila, and</p><p>“You have no right to bind Zeid.”</p><p>She left like that.</p> <p>It was a single remark that set a heavy mood.</p> <p><em>That’s what it seemed.</em></p><p>“She&#8217;s pissing me off! She&#8217;s getting carried away just because she got to S rank a little bit earlier&#8230;&#8230;.! Zeid, Quena! Let&#8217;s train! The result of the strategy meeting = training!”</p><p>Sheila said so with an angry look.</p> <p>Special training, huh. That’s simple.</p> <p>Moreover, when I thought that the discussion in the meeting has finally started, the conclusion came out immediately&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p><strong><a style= "text-decoration:none;" href="">Chapter 2 &#8211; Special Training</a></strong></p>

<p>Me, Quena, and Sheila were in the forest.</p> <p>It is not an ordinary forest. It has an S-rank designation―― it’s the forbidden forest depths. The place where I used to live.</p> <p>The cauldron of hell where the strong eat the strong every day.</p> <p>Right now, Quena and Sheila are also crossing blades with the strong.</p> <p>I watched them from the top of a large tree in the distance, using magic power to raise my visuals and auditory levels.</p><p>“Kunuuh!”</p><p>Sheila&#8217;s voice roars with power.</p> <p>Sheila&#8217;s arm strength, boosted by magic power, is not as weak as her slender appearance.</p> <p>However, the silver Fenrir, who had two fangs stacked on Sheila&#8217;s sword, was pushing her with more force.</p> <p><em>Pachiri</em></p> <div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 --> <div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div> <p>The white light that Fenrir wears rings a warning bell. At that moment―― lightning strikes from both sides of Sheila.</p> <p>Sheila, pushed backward by the force of the fight, cannot even escape by backstepping.</p> <p>With that said, there’s no way she can defend against it.</p> <p>What awaits is death.</p> <p>But――― Quena cleaves Fenrir&#8217;s lightning with her flame-clad sword.</p><p>“Tha,thanks”</p> <p>“You need to tighten up!”</p><p>When Sheila tries to blurt out a word of thanks, Quena yells at her.</p> <p>At the same time, Quena also slashes at Fenrir. But ―― another Fenrir appears.</p> <p>This is the individual that Quena was facing earlier.</p> <p>In order to save Sheila from danger, Quena had left the Fenrir whom she was fighting earlier.</p> <p>―― Not good.</p> <p>I instantly judged so and transition the two people.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 --> <div data-fuse="22386378219"></div> </div> <p>“Fueh!?”</p><p>Sheila, having lost the direction to which her strength is directed, falls into a huge branch at my feet.</p> <p>Next to her, Quena, who was holding her sword up high in a stance with sweat dripping down her face, was stunned, but after a little while, she understood the situation.</p> <p>Then she looks at me resentfully.</p><p>“……I could still do it”</p> <p>“Yes! I still can!&#8221;</p><p>Sheila also complained while holding the bright red bump on her forehead.</p><p>“I appreciate your spirit of challenge. But do you really think you can still do it?&#8221;</p> <p>“……That’s right. You saved us”</p> <p>“Bu,but……”</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 --> <div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div> <p>Quena, being more experienced, nodded while imagining the rest of the battle.</p> <p>Sheila, however, was still not convinced.</p><p>“Suppose you had beaten those two Fenrirs. But it shouldn’t have been enough. What are you going to do after that? You guys are going to 『stay』 in these woods, right? Then don&#8217;t get a scratch.”</p><p>Content of that special training.</p> <p>It is to live at the Forbidden Forest Depths.</p><p>“……Yeah, it&#8217;s just as you say. Sorry”</p> <p>“No need to apologize. This is just another experience.&#8221;</p> <p>“Fuh. But it&#8217;s completely different from when I came here for the exam.”</p> <p>“Have you ever been here, Quena?”</p> <p>“I have. Look now, it was at the request of the Hero Association. At that time, I just needed to avoid dangerous monsters because I was just looking for the desired place, though…… Besides, Zeid&#8217;s presence seemed to keep the monsters away from the center.”</p><p>Quena is correct, &#8220;going through&#8221; and &#8220;living&#8221; are two different things. The difficulty level jumps up.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 --> <div data-fuse="22386378225"></div> </div> <p>This is especially true in this forest.</p> <p>To pass through is reminiscent of death, and to live while fighting means death.</p> <p>There are various monster territories throughout the forest, and battles are fought on a daily basis to expand their territory.</p> <p>So to speak, it’s a battle between different types of species for their fate.</p> <p>If they live there, Quena and Sheila will naturally get involved.</p> <p>This time, I am watching them from a considerable distance. Inevitably, they will also encounter monsters of main class.</p><p>“First of all, Sheila, are you trying to strengthen only your body with magic when you strike or apply power?”</p> <p>“Eh, that’s true, but. Isn&#8217;t that normal?”</p><p>Sheila tilts her head.</p> <p>Quena also listens quietly, as if she’s curious.</p><p>“That&#8217;s fine for the first step. Let me ask you first, how is it possible to strengthen the body with magic power?”</p> <p>“It hasn&#8217;t been clarified clearly yet. That&#8217;s why intuition and sense are so important.”</p> <p>“Ah, that&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s what I heard too. But I actually have my own answer. I think that magic power makes the body a kind of magic itself due to it.”</p> <p>“The body is the magic &#8230;&#8230;?”</p><p>Sheila squints one eye and looks quizzical.</p> <p>I feel like she’s half in doubt with that notion.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 --> <div data-fuse="22386378225"></div> </div><p>&#8220;I haven&#8217;t grasped the substance of magic power and magic. But there is magic power in nature and in the body, and it is certain that magic can be embodied if we imagine it. So I ask you, do you have an 『image』 in mind when you use magic?”</p> <p>“Err. An image of the target being destroyed or blown away…&#8230;”</p><p>While saying that, Sheila huffs.</p> <p>She must have realized. That the magic is altering the 『reason of this world』 through the image.</p> <p>Then she immediately looked at her arm and started groaning, 『Gununu~』.</p><p>“What are you doing?&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;No, I was just trying to imagine what it would be like to be muscular!&#8221;</p><p>Sheila&#8217;s arm has not changed as she says so.</p> <p>Somehow, the composition of that seems stupid.</p><p>“You can do it. In theory, you should be able to use your magic power to alter your own body into a muscular one. It&#8217;s called 『Muscle magic』. It’s just there is a need for an aptitude for it. The one who is good at healing, the one who is good at fire magic. You can strengthen your body, but it takes aptitude to reach the realm of muscle magic.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 --> <div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div> <p>“Muh. Then I can’t do that”</p> <p>“I told you, it&#8217;s all in the image. Once you get good at manipulating magic power, you might be able to make yourself a big muscular guy.&#8221;</p><p>Although it’s kind of funny to see Sheila get all muscular.</p> <p>I continue.</p><p>“So, what do you think would happen if you spread your magic power outside of your body?”</p> <p>&#8220;If it isn’t magic, isn&#8217;t it just going to be useless?”</p> <p>&#8220;That&#8217;s what happens when you use magic without really having a thought, right? However, if you imagine it clearly, it will be different. Try to wrap your body with the 『arm strength to destroy the target』 as if you were using magic. In other words, it is the image of wearing the muscles of magic power all over your body. Your attacks will become much more powerful.”</p><p>When I said this, I heard the sound of something being damaged from the other side.</p> <p>It was from Quena&#8217;s side, who had been listening silently until now.</p> <p>She seemed to have lightly poked her finger into the tree out of curiosity. She was surprised to see the tree easily shattered.</p><p>“You’re kidding…… even though I only put in enough force to touch it.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 --> <div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div> <p>“Muh! That&#8217;s not fair! I was the one being taught! Okay, now it&#8217;s my turn!&#8221;</p><p>And Sheila hits the tree with her hand sword.</p> <p>It&#8217;s like she’s cutting through space―――. The wood slid through Sheila&#8217;s arms like melted butter.</p><p>“Ah, that’s bad”</p><p>I can hear Sheila&#8217;s impatient voice.</p> <p>I said with a sigh.</p><p>“――Transfer”</p><p>I take Quena and Sheila to another tree.</p> <p>The tree that had just been there was falling down in a beautiful section due to Sheila&#8217;s hand sword.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div> <p>“I,I&#8217;m sorry. I didn&#8217;t expect it was this powerful.”</p> <p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m honestly surprised by your senses, you know. Normally, I didn&#8217;t think you could have done it just by me saying it like that, though. Well, Sheila was always somewhat ready for it from the beginning.”</p><p>So I thought, surely, she must know something like this.</p><p>“Eh, I was able to do it? ……But I wasn’t aware of it at all and wasn’t even conscious of it.”</p> <p>“I think you did it unconsciously. Or, it is also possible that the magic power was overflowing from your body unintentionally. Either way, if you can learn to use it consciously from now on, it will take you up one step in strength.”</p><p>My words make Quena and Sheila grin.</p> <p>They must be happy to be able to become stronger in the future.</p><p>“One more thing. How do you imagine the flow of magic power when you create magic?&#8221;</p><p>Quena answered my question first.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div> <p>“I was taught to do it like water flowing.”</p> <p>“Yeah, me too. I mean, that should be the prevailing knowledge on the continent.”</p> <p>“That&#8217;s what physical enhancement is all about. However, if you imagine the type of magic that emits water, there is unnecessary magic power in the details――”</p><p>We continue the special training like this.</p><p style= "text-align:center;"></p><p>The day is coming to an end.</p> <p>The reddish evening sun was beginning to shine through the gaps in the tall trees.</p> <p>Sheila says this, while stretching on the way back to the encampment where we are based.</p><p>“Hmm. I&#8217;m sweating so much, I&#8217;d like to at least take a bath.”</p> <p>“Endure it please. We don&#8217;t have time to carelessly wash our bodies in such a dangerous place.”</p> <p>“Eeh”</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div><p>Quena calmly countered.</p> <p>Indeed, due to the location of the place, it would be quite difficult to take a bath.</p> <p>However, Sheila looks at me as if to cling to me.</p><p>“Hey, Zeid~……”</p> <p>“……Hmm…… it’s not that there wasn’t, but”</p> <p>“Really!?”</p><p>Sheila makes a happy noise at my words.</p> <p><em>That&#8217;s how unbearable it is, I guess.</em></p><p>“Ah, there are places with water where monsters are few and far between.”</p> <p>&#8220;Good!

In the end, it’s still dangerous.”</p> <p>“Eh”</p> <p>“Look now. Just give up. What&#8217;s the special training for?”</p><p>Sheila looks somewhat disappointed.</p> <p>Quena also verbally reprimanded Sheila, but she herself seemed to be a little reluctant to speak.</p> <p>But there&#8217;s more to my words.</p><p>&#8220;However&#8230;&#8230; safety can be ensured if the conditions are met.”</p> <p>““Conditions?””</p>
<p>The word of the two overlapped.</p> <p>Yes, conditions. <em>Conditions I had a hard time saying.</em></p><p>“Ah…… that’s……”</p><p style= "text-align:center;"></p><p>“I’m revived!”</p><p>Sheila is enjoying herself in a good mood with the sound of splashing water.</p><p>“It&#8217;s not bad.&#8221;</p><p>I also heard Quena&#8217;s voice from next to Sheila.</p> <p><em>She looks comfortable too.</em></p> <p>I who thought that…… was concentrating on fulfilling the conditions.</p> <p>It is to stay with these women as much as possible while blindfolded.</p> <p>If I&#8217;m nearby, the monsters won&#8217;t come near them.</p> <p>I also deployed detection magic just in case.</p> <p>However, this is too intense for me.</p> <p>Beyond the piece of cloth, there are the figures of Quena and Sheila who are not wearing a single thread.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Zeid….. You don&#8217;t have to blindfold yourself, though&#8230;&#8230;”</p><p>Sheila approaches with a splash of water.</p> <p>The sound of her voice really conveys how sorry she is.</p><p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not fine, you know. Well, I think it&#8217;s bad, but&#8230;&#8230;”</p> <p>“No, I don&#8217;t mind. Rest is important, too.”</p> <p>“Ehehehe. Zeid is kind”</p><p>I can understand that Sheila is approaching me more and more. She’s very near me.</p> <p>Suddenly, she took my hand.</p><p>“Hey, Zeid should come in too”</p> <p>“No, I&#8217;m not going to do that. I&#8217;m not that dexterous as to bathe in the water while being blindfolded. &#8230;&#8230;”</p> <p>“Mufufu~. That&#8217;s where I come in! All Zeid has to do is just take off his clothes.”</p><p>Sheila says in a disheveled tone.</p> <p>Imagining what Sheila was trying to say, I was at my limit in various ways.</p> <p>I think my nose is going to bleed.</p> <p>Quena stopped Sheila in her tracks.</p><p>“Wa,wait a minute. I don&#8217;t like it if Zeid&#8217;s blindfold comes off by some strange chance. Besides, I don&#8217;t think Sheila really intends to just wash Zeid.”</p> <p>“Arere~, who said anything about washing? Well, I’ll be scrubbing various <em>kinds</em> of places, though.”</p><p>Sheila said without a hint of guilt.</p> <p><em>What the hell is she going to do to me &#8230;&#8230;?</em></p><p>“You’re beyond help…… anyway, that’s no good. Since I’m not here to play around. Then I&#8217;ll wash Zeid myself.”</p> <p>“What was that!? Don&#8217;t tell me Quena is doing the same thing I&#8217;m gonna do!?”</p> <p>“I,it’s different! It&#8217;s not right for us to bathe alone when he is watching us, so at the least I should wash him, is what I think&#8230;&#8230;!”</p><p>That must be Quena&#8217;s real intention.</p> <p>It shows her gentle way of thinking.</p> <p>However, Sheila&#8217;s suspicions, which were covered in worldly desires, did not seem to stop.</p> <p>Sheila approaches Quena.</p><p>“Noo! No questions asked!”</p><p>Sheila pounces on Quena.</p><p>“He,hey……! Hmm……”</p><p>I couldn&#8217;t see them with my eyes, but I somehow knew what they were doing through detection magic.</p> <p>Sheila moved her hands alluringly, and Queena, who was taken by surprise, had her chests rubbed.</p><p>“What tension. What a smooth, lewd skin! Aah, it&#8217;s wonderful!”</p> <p>“S,stop……”</p><p>This is bad.</p> <p>I shut off my consciousness.</p> <p><em>What was the weather like today?</em></p><p>“Muhohou. Do you like it here? You have sensitive skin, too!”</p> <p>“I,it’s different. Something like that……!”</p><p>I think the weather yesterday was rainy.</p><p>“It’s fine so, ey!”</p> <p>“……——!”</p><p>The day before yesterday was sunny.</p> <p>That’s right. It&#8217;s sunny. Today&#8217;s weather was also sunny.</p> <p>Yeah, it&#8217;s sunny.</p><p>“A’re?”</p><p>At the time my reason was about to be blown away, Sheila&#8217;s hand suddenly stopped.</p><p>“……Haahaa. Wha,what&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p><p>Queena, who was suddenly released, asked while adjusting her breathing, which had been disturbed by the intense entanglement she had just experienced.</p> <p>Sheila, on the other hand, puts her hands over her ears.</p><p>&#8220;Can&#8217;t you hear a voice?&#8221;</p> <p>“Voice……? No, I can’t”</p> <p>“Uhmm? What about Zeid?”</p> <p>“Oh, the weather is fine today.”</p> <p>“Zeid?”</p><p>Sheila called my name back in response to my unintelligible reply.</p> <p><em>Not good. My consciousness was also flying.</em></p><p>“Ah. it&#8217;s the voice, right? The voice.”</p><p>I search for the one that might emit a voice with detection magic.</p> <p>However, there are no monsters around. ――This is.</p> <p>No, this guy won’t talk. And I didn&#8217;t hear this guy&#8217;s voice.</p> <p>I can&#8217;t hear anything even if I listen carefully.</p> <p>Like so, I&#8217;m really not sure.</p><p>&#8220;I can&#8217;t hear it either. Aren&#8217;t you just mishearing things?”</p> <p>“Hmm? I indeed heard that, though.”</p><p>Sheila tilts her head, dissatisfied. For her part, she seems convinced.</p> <p>However, there&#8217;s nothing I can do about it, because neither Quena nor I have listened to it.</p> <p>Still, Sheila quickly regained her composure and looked at Quena.</p><p>“Well, it’s fine. Rather than that, I want to experience the feeling of paradise again~!”</p><p>Then Sheila went to rub Quena&#8217;s breasts again.</p> <p><em>I wonder what the weather will be like tomorrow.</em></p><p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p><p>“Yeah, it’s delicious!”</p><p>Sheila satisfies her mouth with meat on bones.</p> <p>We were eating in front of a whole roasted fang wolf. The whole area was pitch black, with only the light from the campfire and the stars overhead.</p> <p>I take a bite of meat in my share.</p> <p>A fluffy fatty flavor fills my mouth. It is a bit heavy, but it matches the chewy meat.</p><p>“It’s certainly delicious”</p> <p>“Right! I season it with spices and portable seasonings here in the woods to get rid of the smell! And the tenderness is――”</p><p>So said Sheila while lightly shaking the meat bone with her fingers.</p><p>“It&#8217;s really delicious. Especially today, it tastes even better than usual.”</p> <p>“Fufuhn. I&#8217;ve grabbed Zeid&#8217;s stomach with this!”</p> <p>&#8220;No, if you do that, it&#8217;s going to be painful and it&#8217;s not worth much.”</p> <p>“That&#8217;s not what I meant&#8230;&#8230;.! what I mean is that you&#8217;re going to be craving my food from now on!”</p> <p>“Hou. Well, it sure is delicious.”</p><p>I said as I bite down on it.</p> <p>If she can create such a great taste with portable seasonings and leaves and grasses collected in the forest, she must be really good at this.</p><p>“Nufufuu~”</p><p>Sheila&#8217;s body swayed from side to side happily at my praise.</p> <p>But suddenly, Sheila looked at a spot in the forest.</p> <p>It was supposed to be pitch-dark in the deep forest, where one could not see more than three meters ahead, but Sheila seemed to have found something for sure.</p><p>“A’re. As I thought, there’s a voice?”</p><p>Sheila muttered so.</p> <p>When she said it, I and Quena listened carefully.</p> <p>The monsters are rampaging in the distance, and I can hear the monsters&#8217; screams of agony.</p> <p>But in this forest, it is such an everyday occurrence. It&#8217;s not something to be mentioned.</p><p>“Again? What are you hearing?”</p> <p>“Something like a human voice &#8230;&#8230; saying 『wake me up. 』”</p><p>Sheila slowly puts down the bone and stands up.</p> <p>Then she starts walking in the direction she was staring at.</p> <p>Me and Quena looked at each other and followed Sheila.</p> <p>Although we can&#8217;t hear the voice, the forbidden forest depths is a dangerous place. Either way, we can’t leave Sheila alone.</p> <p>Sheila, who had been walking for a while, stopped.</p><p>“A’re, this time it sounds like it&#8217;s coming from this way&#8230;&#8230;?”</p><p>Sheila looks doubtful as she raises both her eyebrows and puts her index finger on her chin.</p> <p>I scratch the back of my head at the sight of Sheila and say.</p><p>“I didn&#8217;t tell you this because it would have been too much trouble to untangle you when you were about to take a break, but this is a bird&#8217;s nest of illusions.”</p> <p>&#8220;Eh, nest? But there’s nothing like that &#8230;&#8230;”</p><p>Sheila looks around.</p><p>“I told you, didn’t I? I&#8217;m going to show you the 『illusion』. If I solve it like this —— it will reveal itself.”</p><p>I hold my hand over the empty space to drown out the bird&#8217;s magic. Then the real forest appears.</p> <p>There are a few birds perched in a tree near us, and behind them, countless birds ―― especially children ―― were sleeping in a tight group.</p> <p>However, perhaps feeling threatened by our appearance and the disappearance of the magic, the horde disappeared into the night sky with a hasty rustle.</p><p>“That&#8217;s the bird that creates illusions. We just haven&#8217;t noticed, but we&#8217;ve been made to walk in the same place by them many times since a little while ago. Well, I left them alone because they are harmless and not maliciously misleading us unless we try to find their nests, but they have been a nuisance.”</p><p>However, despite the bird&#8217;s illusions, Sheila was still trying to go straight in a certain direction. We had to walk in the same place after being shown the illusion of obstacles, but Sheila did indeed seem to hear a 『voice』 or something like that. <em>I&#8217;m getting curious about the identity of the voice too.</em></p><p>“Hoeh. That’s right…… ah, but the voice has gotten closer than before! It’s over here, over here!”</p> <p>&#8220;Wait a minute, are you sure you can hear it? It might be a dangerous monster, you know?”</p> <p>“I don&#8217;t think there are any highly dangerous monsters living anywhere near here since that bird was nesting there. I&#8217;ve never been anywhere near here, though.”</p><p>In fact, I have only roasted and eaten that bird once.</p> <p>But after that, it was a pain in the ass because of its obsession to never be eaten, and it was always showing illusions around me.</p> <p>I was glad that once I cast a magic on them, they stopped approaching me, but I didn&#8217;t want to get involved with them anymore, so I didn&#8217;t go near this area, which was their nest.</p><p>“……Ah, it&#8217;s coming from over there!”</p><p>Saying this, Sheila pointed to a mysterious place illuminated by a ray of moonlight.</p> <p>A cold sensation caresses my nose.</p> <p>Emitting a wave of dark magic power —— was a black sword.</p> <p>It was deeply embedded in the raised ground.</p><p>“That…… no matter how you look at it, it&#8217;s not an evil sword. How could something like that be in such a place &#8230;&#8230;?”</p> <p>“I too didn&#8217;t know that there was such a sword.”</p> <p>&#8220;That girl is telling me to pull her out! Hey, hey, can I pull it out!?”</p><p>Sheila says with her face sparkling.</p><p>“It doesn’t look good, isn’t it. No matter how you look at it, it looks ominous&#8230;&#8230; hey now! Don&#8217;t go without permission!”</p><p>It was like a wind asking us, but it seems that Sheila has already decided to pull it out on her own.</p> <p>Quena looks at me.</p> <p>I guess she wants me to persuade her, too. However,</p><p>“Looking at her, Sheila isn&#8217;t under any magic in particular. That was probably something to do with compatibility. Either way, it was destined to end up in Sheila&#8217;s hands one way or another.”</p> <p>“A former knight is perfectly compatible with an evil sword…… is that what it is?”</p> <p>“Either way, I&#8217;ll take every possible precaution.&#8221;</p><p>I deploy a magic circle while saying so.</p> <p>I arrange ten small fist-sized pieces of them so as to surround Sheila and the evil sword.</p> <p>If anything goes wrong, I will use magic to stop her movement.</p><p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll pull it out!&#8221;</p> <p>“Yeah, go ahead, do what you want!”</p><p>Quena consents out of desperation.</p> <p>As if on cue, Sheila draws the sword.</p> <p>The sword, which had been deeply embedded inside, was easily pulled out.</p><p>“Ugh, thi,this is……!”</p><p>Sheila doesn&#8217;t even try to let go of the evil sword that she pulled out, and she looks serious.</p> <p>The magic power of the evil sword is clinging to Sheila.</p> <p>That is.</p><p>“Oy, Sheila, you all right?”</p><p>Perhaps, if she’s not, she has been hijacked.</p><p>“Gununu……even so, I was originally a virtuous knight! To get easily hijacked 『Ufufu♡ Zeid-san』……kuh. My consciousness&#8230;&#8230; 『Do something ni~ce with me♡』……it’s dangerous. I&#8217;m becoming less and less me. &#8230;&#8230;!”</p><p>Her voices of suffering and lewd remarks are repeating alternately.</p> <p><em>……however, this is.</em></p><p>“Err.

Isn&#8217;t she the same as the original Sheila?”</p> <p>“Are you kidding me?? Just how ominous are you!”</p> <p>“I don&#8217;t want to be called that by an evil sword!”</p><p>Sheila is having a conversation with one mouth, speaking words of two personalities.</p> <p><em>What a strange sight.</em></p><p>『I lost. &#8230;&#8230; I never thought there would be a human being who is more twisted than an evil sword……』</p> <p>“Hey, can you please don’t talk to me like I’m perverted!?”</p> <p>『No can do』</p> <p>“Well, you&#8217;re certainly a little twisted these days.

No. A man and a woman doing that before marriage are so indecent…&#8230;!』</p> <p>“Don&#8217;t stop, evil sword. This is destiny! Just like you and I met, this is also destiny!&#8221;</p> <p>『Ugh…… it&#8217;s hard to stop you when you say so &#8230;&#8230;! 』</p><p>Sheila comes close to my face while having a one-person conversation.</p> <p>I can feel Sheila&#8217;s warm breath hitting my face.</p> <p><em>I wonder what. She smells good overall.</em></p> <p>Eh, I shouldn’t wake up from this.</p> <p>All I know is that Sheila is already right in front of me.</p> <p>I hear my own heartbeat. <em>No, is this Sheila&#8217;s?</em></p> <p>I don&#8217;t know that either.</p> <p>I felt an excitement like never before&#8230;&#8230;!</p><p>『No, you can&#8217;t do that as expected! At least wait until after you get married! Otherwise, I won&#8217;t last&#8230;&#8230;! 』</p> <p>“What are you afraid of, Evil Sword! Now is our chance!”</p> <p>『Why am I, an evil sword, stopping your night crawling! If that were the case, this should be the other way around! Anyway, no! I can&#8217;t take it anymore…&#8230;!』</p> <p>“Muh”</p><p>Sheila seems to have calmed down after being rebuked by the evil sword.</p><p>『Sorry for being a pathetic evil sword&#8230;&#8230; If it&#8217;s true, then I want to become even more wicked&#8230;&#8230; 』</p> <p>“It’s fine, you’re okay. I feel like I&#8217;ve become stronger because of you. I&#8217;m lucky to have you!”</p> <p>『Sheila……!』</p> <p>&#8220;Besides, you&#8217;ll just have to get used to it from now on&#8230;&#8230;Guhehe.”</p> <p>『Sheila……』</p><p>In a case-settling fashion, Sheila and the evil sword that haunts her ended their one-man play.</p> <p>It&#8217;s great that they seem to be getting along so well.</p> <p>I thought so, but.</p><p>“The hell with it! I&#8217;m not the kind of person who gives up because someone tells me to!”</p> <p>『Wait!? 』</p><p>It didn’t end beautifully.</p> <p><em>I’m about to be attacked</em>. I thought, but――.</p> <p><em>Kotsu.</em></p> <p>A sound like that was heard.</p> <p>Sheila fell down with a bang.</p><p>“Oy, oy, that’s dangerous”</p> <p>“……did you notice?”</p> <p>&#8220;Obviously―――Yui.”</p><p>I looked at Yui, the dark-haired girl who has been watching us for quite some time.</p> <p>She seems to have put Sheila to sleep by dropping her hand on her neck. She is lying down.</p><p>“Let’s, continue”</p> <p>“No, let’s not!”</p><p>I understood the meaning of her words and instantly quipped into it.</p> <p>She’s bad at giving up.</p><p>“Why? You were awake earlier and didn&#8217;t resist. Am I &#8230;&#8230; not enough?”</p><p>Yui asked, placing her hand on her ample bosom.</p> <p><em>Am I unattractive, </em>is that what she’s saying?</p><p>“……It’s different. I just don&#8217;t intend to join the empire.”</p> <p>“Why?”</p> <p>“It smells like the organization I used to be a part of.&#8221;</p> <p>&#8220;The old order of the Kingdom of Kuzehra?”</p><p>So she already know my information in advance.</p> <p>She said it easily.</p> <p>She is well versed in covert techniques, such as moving in such a way that made Sheila unaware of her movements. It seems that what Riff had said some time ago was true.</p><p>“That’s right. I couldn&#8217;t sleep well at work, and my salary was minimal. It smells the same. Rather, it seems that the darkness in there is deeper……”</p> <p>“Hmm, I can&#8217;t deny it. But you have one point of error.”</p> <p>“Error?”</p><p>Yui comes up to me.</p> <p>Then she strokes my lips with her index finger.</p><p>“The rewards are exorbitantly bouncy. You can have as much money as you want. You can have land as much as you want. The power and position as much as you desire. Everything depends on your strength, as you wish. Even the female body.”</p><p>It&#8217;s a good story for the economy.</p> <p>In fact, the Weira Empire is a powerful nation. If you have power, you can rise up and get what you ask for. It retracts reason through unreasonableness.</p> <p>The fact that a beautiful girl, who was personally praised as a 『Hero Character』 by Riff, is approaching me is also an explanation of the ideology of the Weira Empire. Aside from the fact that there might be misunderstandings in the interpretation on her part, though.</p> <p>However,</p><p>&#8220;That doesn&#8217;t prove that you can get higher achievements.”</p> <p>“Fumu”</p> <p>&#8220;What I really like about the guild is the rank system and point system. It&#8217;s up to the individual to accept the request, and they&#8217;re free to pick and choose a request that matches the reward.”</p><p>The guild is nothing more than an intermediary organization.</p> <p>In the end, for someone like me who distrusts organizations, the guild is the most comfortable place for me.</p><p>“That’s why, I’m sorry, but I won’t be accepting that”</p> <p>“……I understand. But I don&#8217;t think Ruina-sama will let you go.”</p><p>She finally seem to have given up, but Yui leaves a disturbing note.</p> <p>……<em>Quite persistent.</em></p> <p>To be honest, if this continues, I don&#8217;t think I can stand it either. On the rational side.</p> <p><em>I&#8217;ll have to come up with some way to deal with her.</em></p> <p>I thought of that as I watched Yui melt into the shadows.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p><p>A month has passed since then. We&#8217;re taking a lunch break around a bonfire.</p> <p>I was doing Sheila and Quena a favor.</p> <p>It was a favor to give them special training.</p> <p>However, if a request for nomination or an urgent request came in the middle of this venture, that would be given priority, as per our rule.</p> <p>That&#8217;s why, the moment the adventurer card resounded, the two characters &#8216;suspend activity&#8217; popped into my head.</p> <p>However, I haven&#8217;t received any notification on my card.</p> <p>It seemed to be sent only to Quena and Sheila.</p><p>&#8220;What was your request?&#8221;</p><p>I ask as I put a new tree branch in the fire.</p> <p>The girls have gotten strong enough in the past month. That&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t need special training anymore.</p> <p>At first, they looked exhausted, on the edge of their limits, but now, even in the midst of the forbidden forest depths, they were smiling relaxedly.</p> <p>Well, when I&#8217;m around them, monsters don&#8217;t come near them, so they feel at ease when they&#8217;re with me.</p> <p>When I’m away from them, the monsters would attack them mercilessly. Still, Quena and Sheila were now capable of dealing with most of the species here.</p> <p>They have also mastered the art of wrapping magic power around the outside of their body.</p> <p>That&#8217;s why if they have gotten a good request, the special training should be over.</p> <p>But Sheila put the card back in her pocket.</p><p>“It&#8217;s an urgent request for B ranks and above. It&#8217;s a war. I heard that the Kingdom of Stillbeats and the Weila Empire are going fight each other. The Kingdom of Stillbeats has requested reinforcements.”</p> <p>“Heh. Or rather, when did you become a B rank?”</p> <p>“Fufun. That’s because I’m a girl who can do it if she tries!”</p><p>As the stars twinkle, her puffed chest sways.</p> <p>Well, Riff even said that she could have been higher up in terms of her ability.</p> <p>I think this promotion speed is reasonable.</p><p>“A’re, if it’s B-rank or higher, then I should be getting the request as well, though”</p><p>Quena answers my question.</p> <p>She didn&#8217;t keep her card in her pocket.</p><p>“Probably because we&#8217;re dealing with the Weila Empire. Yui is in the Charisma party, right?&#8221;</p> <p>“Yeah, that’s true…… I guess it’s the guild side’s conjecture”</p> <p>“That’s right. They want to avoid the party members colliding with each other.”</p> <p>“That, Yui didn&#8217;t leave the Weila Empire, did she&#8221;</p> <p>“She’s holding two positions concurrently. It&#8217;s troublesome, though, since there aren&#8217;t many people who belong to two organizations.”</p><p>Quena continues to be as well-informed as ever.</p> <p>Suddenly, I got curious.</p><p>“Will Quena accept? This request”</p><p>Unlike Sheila, Quena didn&#8217;t put her card in her pocket and was looking at the request.</p> <p>At least she seemed interested.</p><p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Well, yeah. Since the Weila Empire is the enemy.”</p><p>It&#8217;s a chance to get her sister to look back at her.</p> <p>Sheila, however, is not pleased and looks at Quena bitterly.</p><p>“This is clearly a losing battle, isn&#8217;t it? Stillbeats of a small country against the powerful Weila Empire. &#8230;&#8230;”</p> <p>“If I feel like I&#8217;m going to lose, I&#8217;m going to leave immediately. It seems like I&#8217;m getting paid just to participate in the fight, so I&#8217;ll go as far as I can.”</p> <p>“Muh”</p><p>Quena said with a relaxed smile.</p> <p>Sheila still looks dissatisfied. Then, as a push, Quena winks at her in an energetic pose.</p><p>“Besides, I&#8217;ve been training for the past month in a forest designated as an S-rank by Zeid, you know? I won&#8217;t be easily defeated.”</p><p>In fact, they are getting stronger.</p> <p>They can live for about a week at the forbidden forest depths while fighting without me. Of course, this is also because they have become accustomed to fighting the monsters of this forest.</p><p>“If so, I&#8217;ll go with you! Then I won&#8217;t complain!&#8221;</p><p>Sheila said, clenching both fists in front of her face in a huff.</p> <p>Even I know that if this happens, there&#8217;s no stopping her.</p><p>&#8220;It’s reliable if Sheila would be there.&#8221;</p> <p>“Fuhehe, you&#8217;re not quite honest.”</p><p>Sheila breaks into a radiant smile, perhaps happy to have been praised.</p><p>“Well, you’re an oddball, but you do have power”</p> <p>&#8220;Excuse me for being an oddball!&#8221;</p> <p>“But it’s true, isn’t it”</p> <p>“Muh!”</p><p>The two of them talk to each other in a friendly manner.</p> <p>Well, I think these guys will be fine.</p> <p>They are strong women who have been walking around the battlefield since the beginning. If they became even stronger, there would be few who could compete with them.</p> <p>Among the ones I&#8217;ve met, though.</p><p>“Then I guess we&#8217;re breaking up. It’s fine to end the special training.”</p> <p>&#8220;Eh, is Zeid fine with it? Even if you can&#8217;t eat the meals I make anymore.”</p> <p>“……I don&#8217;t like that a little, but I also want to eat skewers from the old man at the stall.”</p> <p>“What!? Does my food have the same quality as a street stall!?”</p> <p>“No, no, because stalls are no different than luxury goods to me. It&#8217;s not about the price, it&#8217;s about the taste.”</p><p>Sheila seemed shocked that the object of her comparison was a street vendor.</p> <p>However, for me, meat with too much fat is not chewy and makes me hungry.</p> <p>The stalls are just right.</p><p>“I can’t believe it! When we come back, you have to come to Quena&#8217;s house! Then I will feed you my true home-cooked food!”</p> <p>“Yes, yes, I look forward to it.&#8221;</p><p>Sheila points at me with a <em>swoosh</em>.</p> <p>With such a conversation, we went out from the forbidden forest depths.</p>

<p><strong><a style= "text-decoration:none;" href="">Chapter 3 &#8211; Fulfillment of Request</a></strong></p>

<p>Stillbeats Kingdom.</p> <p>It is a small country with a stable economy and military, rich in resources, and a thriving academic community.</p> <p>Many of the royalty who rule this country are excellent.</p> <p>It has produced many gifted people, including a princess who took second place at the academy of Elf Izta, the city of learning, and a prince who was one of the few in the Adventurers&#8217; Guild to achieve A rank at a young age.</p> <p>Perhaps it was inevitable that such a country would be targeted by the neighboring Weira Empire.</p> <p>Declarations of war are little nuisances on the border.</p> <p>But that is the Weira empire&#8217;s usual way of doing things. Their default plan is to make a big deal out of it and merge or usurp the leadership of that country.</p> <p>To escape this crisis, the Kingdom of Stillbeats emptied its treasury and focused their country heavily on the defensive side.</p> <p>They requested reinforcements from their allied countries and also countries hostile to the Weira Empire, along with large sums of money to the adventurers&#8217; guilds and mercenary corps for added reinforcements.</p> <p>Quena and Sheila had come to the Kingdom of Stillbeats for the request.</p> <p>Regardless of whether money is their goal.</p><div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 --> <div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div> <p>“Oh, aren’t you looking nice, neechan! As I thought, you were a prostitute before the war!”</p> <p>“Haha! The Kingdom of Stillbeats is generous too! I can&#8217;t believe they called in the best of the best! It&#8217;s still noon, but let&#8217;s have fun right away!”</p><p>Vulgar voices fly over Quena and Sheila.</p> <p>It was a band of rough-and-tumble mercenaries.</p> <p>A group of more than ten war veterans surrounded them. However, the two men were not afraid of them, and in fact, seemed to be unconcerned about them.</p> <p>The weapons that Quena and Sheila are carrying don&#8217;t even seem to be on their radar.</p> <p>One more step. If the mercenaries had approached, their heads would have been decapitated.</p><p>“Oh, you’re Zeid-aniki’s girlfriend, aren’t you! You came!”</p><p>Such a voice was heard.</p> <p>Quena saw a familiar face there. It was a blonde-haired, blue-eyed, and legitimately handsome man.</p> <p>He is Weeg Stillbeats, the first prince of the Kingdom of Stillbeats.</p> <p>But it was Sheila who was the first to react.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 --> <div data-fuse="22386378219"></div> </div> <p>“Eh!

No, what I’m saying is Quena-neesan……”</p><p>Weeg tries to correct her, but Sheila is already saying, 『As I thought, there are rumors about them』 『I wonder if they&#8217;re a good match for each other! 』in her own world.</p> <p>Seeing such a scene, the mercenaries trembled with fear all over.</p><p>“Ze,Zeid is that S-rank, right……?”</p> <p>“Shit! I told you not to talk to anyone like that every time you see a beautiful woman!”</p> <p>“Look closely! Isn&#8217;t that Quena-san, the A rank girl we see every once in a while&#8230;&#8230;! I know her, alright!”</p><p>Their swagger that had been there earlier was gone, and one by one, they started walking away.</p> <p>In the end, no one was left.</p><p>“Ah, that’s right.

Even if he was an S rank, there is no way that he would accept a request so easily. Besides, Yui and him are in the same party. ……Also, since I’m not his girlfriend.”</p> <p>“Eh! Don’t lie! There are rumors, you know. It was said that Zeid aniki has a lot of women serving him. Fir and Yui have stormed the inn he was staying, and Soria has been raving about Zeid aniki in front of all kinds of people, so there are rumors going around.”</p><p>Aside from Quena and Sheila, they introduced the others, as if they don&#8217;t need to be told.</p> <p>With a twitch, Sheila reacts to that.</p><p>“『……The legal wife is』”</p> <p>“Eh?”</p><p>Weeg&#8217;s cheeks twitched at the sudden cold magic that sends a chill down his spine.</p> <p>Sheila, who had entered her own world until just now, had her face darkened.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 --> <div data-fuse="22386378225"></div> </div> <p>“『The legal wife is me! 』”</p> <p>“Hiieee!

You&#8217;re wasting it here by releasing it needlessly.&#8221;</p> <p>“That’s because!”</p> <p>“Ha,haha. Zied aniki is very popular. I wanted to meet him after a long time, but it was too bad.”</p><p>Within the depths of his heart, it would help him mentally and physically if he would fight with him.</p> <p>Queena, who sensed Weeg&#8217;s inner feelings, said it again.</p><p>“If you want to call for him, you have to ask for a nomination request. And you have to get rid of a lot of ties.”</p> <p>“Well, you’re right……”</p><p>Naturally, the amount is large because the guild will deduct the amount of money, or bribes, they received for making peace with the Weira Empire.</p> <p>Weeg knew this and could only sigh.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 --> <div data-fuse="22386378225"></div> </div> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>On the other hand, around that time.</p> <p>At the royal capital of the Kingdom of Kuzehra.</p><p>“You really were an S-ranked guy!

The reward would be 10 free skewers every day!”</p> <p>&#8220;I,is that okay with you!?&#8221;</p><p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p><p>Weira Empire, a corner of the imperial army&#8217;s tent.</p> <p>There, officer classes from the First to the Fifth Army were gathered sitting around a long desk.</p><p>“Good grief, do I have to be summoned to deal with a small country like Stillbeats?”</p><p>A one-eyed white-haired handsome man, who’s holding his head behind his back and sitting in a rough manner, murmured so.</p><p>“Don’t get carried away just because Ruina-sama is absent, Fonvu.”</p><p>The one who is sternly rebuking the handsome man with a glare is a strict middle-aged man with black hair and blue eyes——Iratsu Aibaf.</p> <p>Fonvu is the first army, military commander.</p> <p>And Iratsu is the second army, military commander.</p> <p>Both of them are at the top ranks in the military of the empire.</p><p>“No, no, Ruina-sama would’ve said the same thing if she were here. It would have been enough just with the old man.”</p> <p>“Stillbeats is a small but stable nation. We also have information that they are spending a considerable amount of money on this battle. Don&#8217;t let your guard down.”</p> <p>“Yes, ye~s. Geez, because of the screw-up of some other guy, Ruina-sama&#8217;s trust in me has been shattered. Hey~, err. Trash, right? Your name.”</p><p>Fonvu looks behind him.</p> <p>Behind him stood the First Army, Deputy Commander ―― Bashina Eirak.</p> <p>This is the man who was once an S-rank and the military commander of the 0th Army.</p> <p>Bashina looked at Fonvu with eyes as if he was going to shoot him dead.</p><p>“…… stop screwing around.”</p> <p>“I’m not screwing around. I don&#8217;t know if you were a former S-rank or a dragon slayer, but you were overrated. I don&#8217;t understand why I have to make you my deputy military commander when you’re supposed to be wiping my ass.”</p><p>Fonvu has a series of complaints.</p> <p>He didn’t mind making the place’s atmosphere worse.</p> <p>If things continue as it is, it wouldn&#8217;t be strange if a killing spree occurred. In the midst of all this, the door to the conference room is opened. Everyone stood up when they saw who had entered.</p><p>“Everyone has gathered, huh. Good work”</p><p>She’s Ruina, the empress of the Weira Empire.</p> <p>While gently raising her hand to encourage them to take a seat, she also sits in the only empty seat.</p> <p>Fonvu complains when he sees the woman accompanying Ruina behind her.</p><p>&#8220;You&#8217;re here too, Yui?&#8221;</p><p>0th Army, the new military commander Yui.</p> <p>Yui didn&#8217;t even react to Fonvu&#8217;s words.</p> <p>This further stirred up Fonvu’s anger.</p><p>“Ruina-sama, why am I not the commander of the 0th Army? Isn&#8217;t it strange that you have suddenly chosen Yui?”</p> <p>“If the top were to be replaced in a hurry, there would be panic below. Besides, I have judged that there was no problem in terms of her competency and management ability.”</p> <p>“As a result of that personnel decision, the guy behind me has been demoted?”</p><p>With a slight sneer, Fonvu looked at Basina. ——The conference room froze.</p> <p>The commanders and deputy commanders became openly hostile to Fonvu.</p><p>“That’s enough. You have no right to talk like that to Ruina-sama.”</p><p>Iratsu tells Fonvu in a low, powerful voice that evokes a sense of caution from the pit of his stomach. That&#8217;s the final warning.</p> <p>If he is going to disobey, the scramble for his life will begin.</p><p>“It’s fine, I didn’t mind that. It&#8217;s only natural for people to get dissatisfied. That&#8217;s why I started a big war and gave them a chance to earn some credit. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ve all heard that Stillbeats is recruiting people from mercenaries up to the guild.&#8221;</p><p>Each military chief class has its own sources of information.</p> <p>Everyone had the basic information down and nodded in unison to Ruina&#8217;s words.</p><p>“There are talks of other nations forming a coalition. There are even rumors that countries under the empire will rebel. I guess it means that we can&#8217;t overlook our expanding empire. Especially since it was made conspicuous by the weakening of the Kingdom of Kuhzera and the repeated misfortunes of the Holy Republic.”</p><p>Everyone reacts to Ruina&#8217;s story as if they already knew it.</p> <p>Ruina continues, while looking at them with satisfaction.</p><p>“I have notified the troops stationed around the country, and I would like to reiterate this to all of you. ——In the near future, I will unify the human race.”</p><p>Ruina&#8217;s eyes glaze over.</p> <p>She herself had no &#8220;power&#8221; in terms of military prowess. However, she had enough charisma and supremacy to overwhelm even those with military prowess.</p> <p>Everyone in the conference room gets goosebumps and trembles.</p> <p>Even Fonvu, whose mouth had been agape earlier, deepened his smile.</p> <p>In fact, the Weyla Empire has the military power to do just that. It has the ability to fight on more than equal terms with all of the countries on its sides.</p> <p>Stillbeats is just one of their stepping stones——</p> <p>Suddenly, Fonvu asks.</p><p>“Come to think of it, about Zeet who crushed this scum in one shot? Zira? What about that guy? Isn&#8217;t it the case that Yui is moving in order to headhunt him?”</p> <p>“I&#8217;ve received the report, but it doesn&#8217;t look like it&#8217;s going to work. I would have preferred to have a person of his caliber, but it seems that he has no intention of coming to the Empire.&#8221;</p> <p>“Heh. If so, maybe he’ll come in this battle of Stillbeats?”</p><p>Fonvu asked a question.</p> <p>He is an individual of unparalleled ability. He also has a keen instinctive sense. He is complacent but he never let his guard down.</p><p>“No, I don’t think he will. It wouldn&#8217;t be a good idea for that vixen to bump into Yui.”</p> <p>“Hah, that’s true. I was going to beat him up, but it&#8217;s too bad.”</p><p>Fonvu said while scratching his head.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p><p>Inside the walls of the capital, <u>W</u>eeg raised his voice to boost the morale of the knights, soldiers, and others.</p> <p>On the other hand, there were two women on the wall in addition to the soldiers.</p><p>“They’re here”</p><p>Quena said while looking into the distance.</p> <p>Sheila, next to her, nodded while squinting.</p><p>“What a great number~. There must have been several fortresses in this place, but they didn&#8217;t look like they&#8217;ve been scraped at all.”</p><p>The capital Fulfort is in the center of the Kingdom of Stillbeats. It is surrounded by mountains on both ends and only has one major road existing for transportation.</p> <p>That&#8217;s why it was set up with multiple traps and fortifications, but they all seem to have been overrun.</p> <p>The armies of the Weira Empire, with high morale, are on their way to the Fulfor capital.</p> <p>Standing in the front of them was――Yui.</p> <p>Their flags included the red-colored crown flag of the Weira Empire and a military flag with a black base and white lettering 『0』 embroidered on it, indicating they’re the 0th Army.</p><p>&#8220;A big shot comes out from the beginning!&#8221;</p> <p>“Behind her there is also the blue flag of the First Army and the yellow flag of the Second Army. I don&#8217;t want to sound like I&#8217;m talking out of my ass before the fight, but this really is a losing battle.&#8221;</p><p>Quena draws her sword. The flaming red blade of the sword is exposed.</p> <p>Likewise, Sheila drew her pure black sword. Although there was no morphological change in it, a cold magic power that made one tremble floated around it.</p><p>“『Let us make it a winning battle. 』&#8221;</p> <p>“……Fufu. That’s right”</p><p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p><p>The battle lines were a stalemate. With only a limited amount of land available for fighting, a single main road, the Weira Empire could not push with numbers. The mountains were littered with traps and hidden soldiers, and the Imperial Army was at the mercy of the enemy.</p> <p>The straight road on the plain is covered with piles of corpses from the magic and arrows fired from the outer walls, and it is overflowing with soldiers trying to stop them from moving forward.</p> <p>But the Weira empire also expected this much.</p> <p>The corpses that get in their way ―― even if they are still breathing ―― are blown forward with their wind and water magic to serve as shields against the enemy&#8217;s magic and arrows.</p><p>“『―― Isn’t your country way too dangerous? 』”</p><p>Sheila says to the enemy in front of her, who seems to be greatly pulling back in such a war situation.</p> <p>Her tone is light, but she never let her guard down for a millimeter with a proper grip on the hilt of her sword.</p><p>“……”</p> <p>“『I wish you would at least respond. 』&#8221;</p><p>Suddenly, Yui stops.</p> <p><em>Oh?</em> Sheila reacted by saying that, but a black shadow was created from the ground. The shadow then changes its shape into a knife or a spear. Those weapons went straight to Sheila with great speed.</p> <p>Surrounded on all sides by weapons made up of shadows, Sheila fights back with her sword, but there are too many of them.</p> <p><em>One more move.</em> Yui closes in on her. The small sword in her hand runs into Sheila&#8217;s neck, stabbing her for the final blow――― A flaming sword stops it just in time.</p><p>“『So,somehow, I, I feel like I&#8217;m being saved by Quena every time! 』&#8221;</p> <p>“If you feel that way, then train out more.&#8221;</p> <p>“『Muh! I&#8217;m doing it! 』”</p><p>Sheila&#8217;s cheeks puff out in disapproval.</p> <p>In fact, her ability is growing.</p> <p>One of the Weira Empire&#8217;s plans was to boost the front line with the help of Yui, a powerful individual. It was a simple but effective way to gradually push forward a stalemated front.</p> <p>The two of them are the only ones holding Yui in check. That is what proves the power of the two of them.</p><p>“……You guys are”</p> <p>“『Oh?』”</p><p>Yui blurted out.</p><p>&#8220;The people at the inn who were with Zeid?&#8221;</p> <p>“That’s right. You remembered us”</p> <p>“Yes. I thought you were weak then, but you have gotten stronger. Did Zeid train you?”</p> <p>“『Why do you know that!? 』”</p><p>Sheila was taken aback.</p> <p>Because in her mind, it was a secret training. However, Yui was actually at the Forbidden Forest depths, watching them. It was obvious that she knew about it, but she could not grasp the details of the special training that dealt with the invisible power of magic.</p><p>“You guys are worrisome now. Ziad may dislike me and it may interfere with my headhunting mission, but ―――― you should disappear?”</p><p>She moves backward as she says it. And Yui&#8217;s own shadow multiplies explosively. A myriad of shadows of 『Yui』 appear and all of them start to combine.</p> <p>The increasingly bloated shadows painted the ground black.</p><p>“『Wha, what!? 』”</p><p>The shadow, still in the shape of a human ―― rises from the ground.</p> <p>Its huge body, which is more than the size of a dragon, blocked even the sun. It’s looking down at them like trash grains, from a line of sight equal to that of the clouds.</p><p>“Shadow Giant(Altiego)”</p><p>It was by no means just a show.</p> <p>An extraordinary sense of intimidation and unusual magic power enveloped the giant&#8217;s entire body.</p> <p>Everyone gazed in stunned amazement at the huge figure looking down on them.</p><p>“Ruina-sama told me to become a hero. That&#8217;s why it&#8217;s fine to be as flashy as this――”</p><p>The corners of Yui&#8217;s mouth, with her face filled with a blank expression, turned up.</p><p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1301-728x1024.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1024" /></p><p>The commander-in-chief Ruina, who was watching the scene from a distant tent, was sweating coldly, but she still smiled fearlessly.</p><p>“……you tend to go overboard, really.&#8221;</p><p>An existence called a hero will always remain in people&#8217;s hearts.</p> <p>No one will ever be able to forget Yui&#8217;s magic, which compelled awe from friend and foe alike.</p> <p>This is where it all comes down to. If she loses here, it will only be for show.</p> <p>However, if she wins, she will be praised by her own allies, and her unusual magic will be revered like a god.</p><p>“――Smash them”</p><p>The shadow giant(Altiego) gets down on one knee and opens his hand. It is like a child casually trying to kill an insect on the ground.</p> <p><em>Hyugoooh!</em> Like so, a hand closes in on the army that is carrying the front line of the Fulfor capital, cutting through the wind. When they see it, which has a certain mass, all of them run away as if they were spiders scattering.</p> <p>However, Sheila and Quena, who would be under the palms of its hands, did not make the slightest move, not caring what was going on around them.</p><p>“Which one of us will face it?”</p> <p>“『Then, I will! ――Disaster pierce』”</p><p>Saying that, Sheila swings her sword towards the hand of the shadow. Then multiple black spots are created in the space where the sword cut and radiated vigorously. The black spots then grow larger as they progressed.</p> <p>The black spot makes several holes in the giant&#8217;s hand. However, the holes heal spontaneously, without any sign of it being in pain. That too happens in an instant.</p><p>“『Eeh! Why! 』”</p><p>Sheila, who was confident in her attack, was surprised to see the giant who didn&#8217;t seem to pay attention to it.</p> <p>―― The hand of the giant thrusts into the ground.</p> <p>Dust dances with the heavy rumbling of the earth due to that.</p> <p>It reached Ruina and the Fulfor capital.</p> <p>There were soldiers who managed to escape. However, Quena and Sheila who were fitted in the palm of its hand――.</p><p>“――Flame Dance(Enjin Butoh)”</p><p>With Quena&#8217;s voice, she released a slash of flame and the giant&#8217;s hand flies through the air.</p> <p>A great force of fire engulfed the area. At the center of it was Quena who was clad in flames.</p><p>“『There’s something about Quena taking all the good parts from me&#8230;&#8230; 』.&#8221;</p> <p>“I didn’t do it with the intention of taking it. In the first place, what&#8217;s good about your fight―――― wait. This is not the time to be talking about that.”</p><p>The hand of the giant that should have been cut off regenerated.</p> <p>This time, it raises both its hands to the sky.</p><p>“It is still getting used to it. But it&#8217;ll go faster this time.&#8221;</p><p>Yui tells them coldly.</p> <p>The impact came twice this time. Next was the wind pressure, it would blow anyone away, regardless of being a friend or foe. Everyone on the battlefield understood that, and now everyone turned their backs to the shadow giants (Artiego). Except for Quena and Sheila.</p><p>“Do it well this time. I&#8217;ll go to Yui&#8217;s side.&#8221;</p> <p>“『Ye~s. I don&#8217;t need your help this time! 』”</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;I wonder if it&#8217;s really okay.&#8221;</p><p>Quena said so anxiously.</p> <p>Still, she insisted that she didn&#8217;t need any more help. Quena looked at her opponent, Yui.</p> <p>Yui stood calmly and naturally.</p><p>“That leeway will come back to bite you.&#8221;</p><p>Quena raised her sword with both hands and swung it down at once.</p> <p>The flames wrapped around the sword traveled through the ground and stretched straight toward Yui.</p> <p>However, a shadow different from the giant creates a wall in front of Yui&#8217;s eyes to block the flames. ――At that moment.</p> <p>Blazing fire attacks Yui from all her sides.</p> <p>The flames that had been straightened and extended flared up like a blossoming flower.</p> <p>A wall of shadows surrounds Yui on all sides to protect her.</p> <p>Then a red sword blade pierces the wall of shadow with a high-pitched clang.</p><p>“I was thinking of steaming her, but I think I would just roast her whole.&#8221;</p><p>Along with Quena&#8217;s words, scorching flames are produced from the blade of her sword.</p> <p>All of a sudden, the walls are enveloped in high temperatures.</p> <p>A few moments later, Quena pulls her sword from the wall. The flames stop and the wall disappears. ――but the dead body of Yui wasn’t there.</p><p>“Wha,where……!”</p> <p>“It’s the end”</p> <p>“Tsu!”</p><p>A dagger rests on Quena&#8217;s neck.</p> <p>Yui had appeared behind her before she knew it.</p> <p><em>Death</em></p> <p>Such words flashed through Quena&#8217;s mind.</p> <p>When she was unable to understand how she got behind her――.</p><p>“『Dangerous! 』”</p><p>In the nick of time, Sheila repels Yui&#8217;s dagger.</p> <p>Taking a look, she saw many holes in the body of the giant.</p> <p>Sheila stares at Quena with a smug look on her face. As if to say, 『How about it, I saved you!』.</p> <p>However, Quena slashes at Yui the moment she realizes that her life is saved. It&#8217;s the right decision on the spur of the moment, though.</p> <p>Yui disappears.</p> <p>It is not a metaphor, but her figure has disappeared exactly as it was.</p> <p>She surveys on each side. But she isn’t there.</p> <p>Suddenly, Yui appears from the shadow of the giant.</p><p>“……So that’s your trick”</p><p>Quena is convinced. Of how could she suddenly disappear from inside the wall and suddenly appear behind her.</p> <p>Yui can move freely between shadows.</p> <p>Quena had heard of a similar type of magic, although its users were rare.</p><p>“Sheila. Buy me a little time”</p> <p>“『Roger!』”</p><p>At Quena&#8217;s request, Sheila re-holds her pure black sword. Sheila understood Quena&#8217;s plan from her experience of fighting together with her until now.</p> <p>Quena raises her sword. A small ball of flame emerges from the tip of the sword. Then it gradually becomes huge.</p> <p>It doubled, tripled, quadrupled &#8230;&#8230; it steadily became larger. But it was slow.</p> <p>Naturally, for Yui, she was the target.</p> <p>However, Sheila has prepared in advance.</p><p>“『I&#8217;ll be your partner for a while. 』&#8221;</p> <p>“……!”</p><p>The look in Yui&#8217;s eyes changes.</p> <p>Yui approaches Sheila at the same time as the shadow giant (Artiego), which now has a hole, vanishing. She is so fast that the dust of sand dances with a second&#8217;s delay.</p> <p>She gets between the two of them.</p><p>“Die”</p> <p>“『Oh, shit! 』”</p><p>Yui&#8217;s slash splits into multiple pieces. At first, she thought they were just afterimages, but they are not.</p> <p>It just 『split』 as it is.</p> <p>Multiple shadows of Yui grow from the base of her hand.</p> <p>However, Sheila only repels the attacks aimed at her vital points. She would be inflected with some wounds, but that can&#8217;t be helped. She doesn’t have the capacity to return everything.</p><p>(But ―― if it wasn&#8217;t for Zeid&#8217;s special training, I would have died!)</p><p>She gained the ability to respond to Yui&#8217;s speed of attack and the ability to make immediate decisions. Her technique of magic power operation has also improved, and all of her ability values have risen by an order of magnitude.</p> <p>She feels like she has gotten more competent.</p> <p>She was having fun slashing at each other.</p> <p>Occasionally, Yui&#8217;s attack will cause a shadow sword to approach from behind, or she will try to attack Quena.</p> <p>However, the pure black sword does not allow it to reach her.</p> <p>It is absolutely unbreakable. and gives the owner magic powers. ――The Evil Sword.</p><p>(Thanks, Evil Sword-san.)</p> <p>(It&#8217;s your bad habit. You don&#8217;t think during a battle!)</p><p>Sheila had learned how to talk to the evil sword in her head.</p> <p>What&#8217;s more, the Evil Sword had a lot of combat experience.</p> <p>Apart from Zeid, Sheila had also received combat training from the evil sword――.</p> <p>Nevertheless.</p> <p>The one-on-one duel with Yui was tough for her.</p> <p>Her wounds spread and increased, and her body&#8217;s range of motion narrowed. There was also a difference in their stamina.</p> <p>She hasn’t filled up her full ability yet.</p><p>(Kuh……! Evil Sword-san, if this happens ――!)</p> <p>(No, it’s okay. Look behind you)</p> <p>(……!)</p><p>As instructed by the Evil sword, she dodged Yui&#8217;s attack and looked behind her.</p> <p>―― A huge flame was floating on the tip of Quena&#8217;s sword.</p> <p>It is as big as Yui&#8217;s giant.</p> <p>Sheila&#8217;s back was enduring the searing heat, but she was too focused on the battle to realize that.</p> <p>The whole area is also dominated by the hot haze.</p><p>&#8221; ――Thank you for waiting, Sheila.”</p> <p>“『You&#8217;ve made me wait too long. Please take care of the rest, partner.』”</p> <p>“Yes, I can&#8217;t quite handle it yet, so it took some time, but I&#8217;m finally ready. Eat this ―――― Blazing Giant Ball(Endeavor)!”</p><p>The gigantic mass of flames closes in on the Weira&#8217;s imperial army.</p> <p>Normally, Yui would retreat before getting into such a mudslinging fight. That was her strength, her judgment, and her nature.</p> <p>But the task given to her is to become a 『hero』.</p> <p>She can’t make a retreating figure here.</p><p>“……Aaaaah! Shadow Giant (Artiego)!”</p><p>Once again, the giant appears.</p> <p>This time, Yui also uses a large amount of magic power and intercepts Quena&#8217;s Blazing Giant Ball (Endeavor).</p> <p>The two collided with each other――</p><p>“Haa…… haa……!”</p> <p>“Fuh…… haa……”</p><p>It was Quena and Yui.</p> <p>Both of them are breathing unevenly.</p> <p>They both look exhausted.</p> <p>Sheila, too, had wounds all over her body and was in no condition to fight.</p><p>“『Muh……!』”</p> <p>“Haha, I can’t beat you with this, huh. You&#8217;re a genuine monster.&#8221;</p><p>The three are confident in their skills.</p> <p>That&#8217;s why they can admit to each other. That they have been able to fight each other this far.</p><p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1351-728x1024.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1024" /></p><p>And for Quena and Sheila, they were pleased that they were able to cut so much ground against a monstrous child who could be called a being above the clouds.</p> <p>But Yui, on the contrary is――.</p><p>“You are strong. But I can&#8217;t lose. I can&#8217;t lose here――&#8230;&#8230;!”</p> <p>“No, that&#8217;s enough.”</p> <p>“Tu!?”</p><p>A voice comes from behind Yui.</p> <p>It was Ruina.</p> <p>The Empress herself stood on the battlefield. Surrounding her stood Fonvu of the First Army.</p><p>“I,I can still fight……!”</p> <p>“I&#8217;m not accusing you of anything, I understand what you&#8217;re capable of. This time, just beating Stillbeats will be an accomplishment, and it&#8217;s enough to make your presence felt.”</p> <p>“……!”</p><p>At Quena&#8217;s words, Yui also backs down.</p> <p>However, as for Yui, she was dissatisfied. Because she thought she could do more. That is, until even the outer walls of the capital are broken down and subdued――.</p> <p>This was possible only with the 0th Army led by Yui.</p><p>“――Don&#8217;t make such a sulky face. This time there was just an irregularity. I&#8217;m looking forward for the next time onwards.”</p> <p>“……Yes”</p><p>The 『sulky face』 doesn&#8217;t change much on Yui&#8217;s face.</p> <p>It&#8217;s a blank expression itself.</p> <p>But she could even notice such subtleties. Such skill was one of the strengths of Empress Ruina, who ruled a great country.</p> <p>Then Ruina looked at Quena and Sheila.</p><p>“You’re strong”</p><p>Brief words.</p> <p>Quena shudders her body. Caught by surprise, her eyes widen.</p> <p>It was the first time in her life that she had received a compliment from her sister. It was a word that she had been passionately wanting to definitely hear someday.</p> <p>It was uttered abruptly on the battlefield, and she had an unexpected reaction.</p> <p>She was thinking of things like, &#8220;Let&#8217;s stay calm even if I was praised,&#8221; or &#8220;I&#8217;ll just make fun of the amount which I’ve been underestimated so far,&#8221; but due to the sudden incident, Quena couldn&#8217;t react in anyway.</p><p>“You&#8217;ve grown&#8230;&#8230; yeah, you&#8217;ve really grown. It seems that at that time, people said that you had no chance at all, but after all, Quena is quite strong. I believed in you.”</p> <p>“……tu!”</p><p>It&#8217;s not just about praise.</p> <p>She has given her compliments as if to shake Quena&#8217;s inferiority complex she had been harboring.</p> <p>A few seconds of time. With just that, Quena&#8217;s heart has been melted by Ruina.</p> <p>It was as intense as the length of time she wanted to make her look back on her.</p><p>“――Come back to the Weira Empire. We sisters, together, let&#8217;s make the empire stronger.”</p> <p>(……――Ah, no more.)</p><p>Tears roll down from Quena&#8217;s cheeks.</p> <p>The tear gland that had been holding it back broke down. All of her efforts had paid off.</p> <p>It is simply a joyful feeling.</p> <p>But somewhere.</p> <p>Deep down inside her, there was a different emotion than joy.</p> <p><em>What is this</em>――.</p><p>“You should come to the Weira Empire too, blonde-haired girl. We will treat you very well”</p> <p>“『No thanks. I don&#8217;t know about Quena, but I&#8217;d rather be in the guild where Zeid is. 』”</p> <p>“Zeid?”</p><p>The unexpected name of the person causes Ruina to raise one eyebrow.</p> <p>Hearing the name Zeid, Quena stimulated that feeling.</p> <p>“Ah……” Said Quena with a smile.</p> <p>She now knows what the emotion is.</p><p>“I too…… still have someone whom I want to be recognized. It’s the guy named Zeid. I don&#8217;t want sympathy from that guy, I want to be recognized as his official party member with my ability. So I&#8217;m going to decline that invitation.”</p> <p>“――oy, oy, oy, you guys can’t simply refuse, you know?”</p><p>Fonvu, who was standing beside Ruina, snaps his fingers while grinning.</p> <p>It was an obvious battle stance.</p><p>“『Quena &#8230;&#8230;! 』”</p> <p>“Yes. It&#8217;s time to withdraw――tu!&#8221;</p><p>They chose to avoid further fighting as much as possible.</p> <p>In that sense, the two people choose to run away.</p> <p>But Fonvu closed in on them.</p><p>“――You think I&#8217;m gonna let you get away?”</p><p>A kick.</p> <p>It was just that.</p> <p>But Sheila&#8217;s arm makes a nasty noise as she catches it with her sword.</p> <p>Her body was blown off the ground, but a hard, thick wall of earth is created behind her, causing extra damage.</p> <p>The creator of that is, of course, Fonvu. He is the only one here who has that much power to spare.</p><p>“Sheila!”</p> <p>“Haha! You can try to resist. Show me how powerful you are for making the 0th Army&#8217;s commander so worn-out!”</p> <p>“Kuh……!”</p><p>Quena&#8217;s sword flame burns fiercely as she prepares for her second battle.</p> <p>But that second battle is a retreat.</p> <p>In order to somehow buy time to let Sheila alone escape.</p><p>“You&#8217;re really intending on running away from us, aren&#8217;t you? You really let these girls beat you, Zeroth Army Commander-sama.”</p><p>While enjoying the frantic appearance of Quena, he also makes sure to disrespect Yui.</p> <p>With Ruina in the place, Fonvu is also very clear in his attitude. The nagging second army chief commander isn’t there either.</p><p>“Hey. A charisma party, or a former S-rank. &#8230;&#8230; I think you have been bought by too many stupid titles, you know? You don&#8217;t pay attention to a soldier like me who crawled up from the bottom?”</p> <p>“……Are you not happy with being the military commander of the First Army? I think I have given you an exceptional treatment, though”</p><p>Ruina turned her hand behind her back.</p><p>“It&#8217;s not about the treatment that I object to! It&#8217;s the guy above me! Look at her! She was entrusted with the vanguard, but she was defeated by two nameless females! Does this guy really deserve to be the commander of the 0th Army over me? Aah!?”</p><p>Fonvu&#8217;s tone is rough. As if he was exploding the grievances he had been accumulating until now.</p><p>“Those two are strong. That&#8217;s why I wouldn&#8217;t complain about their match being declared draw either.&#8221;</p> <p>“That&#8217;s the problem! Then what about me!? I have the power to take on these two! I can kill Yui in seconds! How come I&#8217;m not the commander of the 0th Army!?”</p> <p>“Then I&#8217;ll give you a chance to fight Yui next time.&#8221;</p><p>For Ruina, a change of military commanders was not very desirable.</p> <p>This is because of the troublesome problems that may arise, such as disruption of the chain of command and the handover of information.</p> <p>But, of course, the Weira Empire emphasizes ability, achievement, and performance. If there is a clear difference in power between them, she will accept the replacement without any objection.</p> <p>That is why Fonvu has not made it up to the 0th Army because he hasn’t been able to prove his ability——.</p><p>“Give me a chance to fight Yui? ……Fu.Fuhaha! No, it’s not that Ruina”</p> <p>&#8220;What do you want me to say?&#8221;</p> <p>“You can&#8217;t even tell the difference between me and Yui ―― which means you&#8217;re not worthy to be my 『Superior』 either.”</p><p>Fonvu distorted smile emerged.</p><p>“In other words? You mean you’re leaving the Weira empire?&#8221;</p> <p>“Haha! That conclusion doesn&#8217;t make sense. It&#8217;s simple, I&#8217;m going to eat you and I&#8217;ll become the emperor.”</p><p>Fonvu&#8217;s eyes glinted.</p> <p>Those are the eyes of a man who plans to rise in dominance.</p> <p>Ruina, however, was blissfully unperturbed.</p><p>“Eat me? You will be executed by another military commander if you kill me.”</p> <p>“No, that won&#8217;t happen.”</p> <p>“What?”</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve actually found something really useful, y’know?&#8221;</p><p>Fonvu pulls something out of his pocket.</p> <p>However, it is impossible to grasp its substance from Ruina&#8217;s point of view. It is that thin. She could barely grasp that it was something circular by looking at the way Fonvu was holding it —— she guessed it.</p><p>“……No way”</p> <p>“It’s no way, alright. This is a slavery collar. Moreover, it was custom-made during the dispute in the Kuhzera Kingdom.&#8221;</p><p>Fonvu rotates the collar with his fingers.</p> <p>Like a child proudly flaunting a new toy he has acquired.</p> <p>However, Ruina denies it.</p><p>“That&#8217;s impossible. Do you know how much manpower and money one has to spend to find that item? The new upper echelons of the Kingdom of Kuhzera and the guild who received the request were going around doing everything in their power to erase it.”</p> <p>“Kuhkuhku……. That’s right. Maybe there&#8217;s only one of these left in the world. The production drawings and the people involved in producing it are either locked up in a pigsty or are already gone. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m lucky. Really, I&#8217;m just lucky.”</p><p>But, Fonvu continues.</p><p>“That luck is enough. It’s like the goddess is saying, she wants me to rule the world! Therefore, I&#8217;m going to use you as the first step. With this collar.”</p> <p>“I knew you were a confident man, but I didn&#8217;t know you were this arrogant. How many of the military commanders and sub-commanders are really so stupid that they won&#8217;t notice my condition as a slave?”</p><p>Ruina&#8217;s reading is correct.</p> <p>In fact, even though many people in this world are not as good as Ruina, they do not overlook even the slightest sense of discomfort.</p><p>“No, that&#8217;s overly optimistic. I realized it, ya know? You have called together the military commanders with your hands behind your back. And all this time we&#8217;ve been talking, you’ve been buying time, right?&#8221;</p><p>After reading that much.</p> <p>Fonvu deepens his smile.</p><p>“But it was a pity. The other chief commanders are being stalled by my men. What&#8217;s more, the ones who might betray my troops have been bribed. The military commander of the Third Army and the deputy commander of the Fifth Army are already under my command. I wonder who else might have been bribed by us as if to take advantage of this mess?”</p> <p>“I&#8217;m at a loss. How can you think so well?&#8221;</p> <p>“Hahahah! I won&#8217;t let you surrender. I&#8217;m going to put this collar on you and that&#8217;ll be the end of it.”</p><p>Like a child, Fonvu headed towards Ruina.</p> <p>Just before that.</p> <p>Yui stands between Ruina and Fonvu.</p><p>&#8220;Ruina-sama, please run away. For me right now, buying time is my top priority.”</p> <p>“I won’t even let you buy time!”</p> <p>&#8220;Gupuu&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</p><p>He released a foot technique on Yui’s abdomen.</p> <p>She almost spews vomit all over the place, but she holds it back.</p> <p>It’s the result of her well-trained body and magic power manipulation that she never takes her feet off the ground like Sheila<em>. </em>She was stubbornly trying to buy time for Quena to escape.</p><p>“Fonvu, wait. You better not lay a hand on Yui.”</p> <p>“Ah? What do you mean”</p> <p>“Yui is an officer of the Weira Empire, but she&#8217;s also registered as an adventurer in the guild. Moreover, she is a rare talent with an S rank. If something were to happen, the guild would take appropriate action.”</p> <p>“Hah. That&#8217;s why I said, the guild is a world where life and death are the norm.”</p> <p>“However, the party that Yui is in also has Soria, Fir, and Zeid. The guild side pays particular attention to this party&#8230;&#8230;”</p> <p>“You’re noisy. I don&#8217;t care about the guild, I don&#8217;t care about that bunch of disorderly fellas. They may be in a party, but they are a bunch of trash in name only. They&#8217;re useless scums like Yui anyway――”</p><p>――Suddenly, when he came to his senses, a man was standing beside Fonvu.</p> <p>He didn&#8217;t even feel his sign, he didn&#8217;t even make a sound.</p> <p>Fonvu&#8217;s mouth stopped at the unexpected situation.</p> <p>A dark-haired man wearing a white mask was in there. The mask has cracks that have been clumsily fixed with glue.</p> <p>On his shoulder, he carried a young man with glasses.</p> <p>The young man is mumbling as he reads. If they listen carefully,</p><p>“In other words, in magic ethics, brainwashing is the process by which magic power changes its properties and becomes a different principle than magic, a granular form of something even finer than magic power called magic foundation, and is then applied to the spinal cord――――”</p><p>His mouth never stops.</p> <p>He didn’t let this situation get to him.</p> <p>But the problem is the masked man.</p> <p>He clearly appeared here on purpose.</p><p>“Yo,you are”</p> <p>“Was it you who said that the Charisma party was a bunch of useless scums?&#8221;</p> <p>“……Ha? Say what?”</p> <p>“I don&#8217;t know anything about them. But hey, I heard that they’re a group of people who are stronger than me. Yeah, so if I beat you, that means the Charisma party people are stronger, right?”</p><p>It seemed like a deliberate statement, but Fonvu felt that he was being asked to retract his previous statement.</p> <p>Moreover, 『If I beat you』 is a statement that strikes a nerve with Fonvu right now.</p> <p>Fonvu pops a vein on his forehead.</p><p>“……! Bring it on――――abuh!”</p><p>What happened, wasn’t something worth mentioning.</p> <p>It’s just the masked man hitting him.</p> <p>It’s really just that much. That&#8217;s all there was to it, but Fonvu sank into the ground.</p> <p>A crater was formed on the ground centered on Fonvu&#8217;s body.</p><p>“Kah……!? Wha……ah?”</p> <p>“Oi, oi, is this all it takes to bring you down?”</p><p>The masked man bends his knees to look down at the fallen Fonvu.</p><p>“Yo,yo…… you…… who are you……”</p> <p>“I’m just a masked man who happens to be passing by. Or rather, Yui, who protects her master, is by far stronger than you. You take the members of the Charisma Party too lightly.”</p> <p>“Cha,charisma pa……? N,no one can be that &#8230;&#8230;”</p> <p>“Ah, shit, I only said “Party”, didn’t I? No, yeah, I knew her because I heard the names of the members. And the name “Charisma Party” is spreading around.”</p> <p>“……y,yo…..u”</p> <p>&#8220;And therefore, those two who fought evenly with Yui are also strong. They’re not opponents whom you can deal with.&#8221;</p> <p>“……Uh…………”</p><p>Like so, Fonvu said nothing more.</p> <p>Or rather, he couldn&#8217;t speak.</p> <p>The consciousness that he had barely maintained suddenly fizzled out.</p><p>“……You. Zeid, what are you doing?&#8221;</p><p>Quena asks, still holding her sword at bay because the situation is changing so quickly.</p> <p>She was already aware of the identity of the masked man.</p> <p>But the masked man ―― Ziad ―― continues with his blunt acting.</p><p>“Bah! I,it’s different. I’m not Zeid! I’m Masked Man. It would be strange for Zeid to be here. If he gets into a fight with the Weira Empire, what would be his position?”</p> <p>“There are only a limited number of people who know such internal circumstances, though……  Besides, I don&#8217;t know anybody who can put on that kind of magic power when you hit that guy over there except you.&#8221;</p><p>Quena&#8217;s eyes were also trained through their month of special training.</p> <p>Though it&#8217;s not as strong as Zeid, she can feel the presence of magic power.</p> <p>For that reason, she can see that he was wearing beautiful layers of magic power on his arms, orderly and multi-layeredly stacked.</p> <p>As far as Quena knows, Zeid is the only one who can do such a trick.</p><p>“No! Silence! More importantly, what are you doing fighting so recklessly!? First things first, and I say this with the greatest of kindness, but you better know when to run away!&#8221;</p> <p>“……Yeah. you&#8217;re right. I&#8217;m sorry. I&#8217;m still inexperienced after all.”</p><p><em>Fuh</em>, Quena says while exhaling softly.</p> <p>She put the sword back in its sheath, which was now weakly lit. She looked tired, but she also felt somewhat unsatisfied.</p> <p>The masked man looks at her and says after a short pause.</p><p>“But, well. That&#8217;s good, isn&#8217;t it? You&#8217;re getting stronger. I can feel it.”</p> <p>“Well yeah. Thanks to you.”</p> <p>“T,to whom are you thanking……! Well, that’s fine. I&#8217;m going home too.&#8221;</p> <p>“Wa,wait, Zeid-kun”</p><p>When Zeid was about to return, he was stopped.</p> <p>The other party who did that is Ruina.</p> <p>Called by his name by a first-class person with whom he shouldn&#8217;t get involved.</p> <p>For the first time in a long time, Zeid felt an unpleasant greasy sweat.</p><p>“I, I don’t know who are you talking about. Zeid, is it. I don&#8217;t know who that is, so I’m going back!”</p> <p>“I&#8217;m kidding. Should I call you &#8220;Masked Kun&#8221; here? No, no, you saved me. I almost surrendered myself to become an insignificant servant with a slavery collar.”</p><p>Ruina says with a gentle smile as if she is indebted to him. No one who has seen the war situation so far will doubt that she is grateful from the bottom of her heart when they see that spectacle.</p> <p>However, Zeid was different.</p><p>“Haha, you must be joking.”</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230;Why do you think so?”</p> <p>“An army is approaching. And there’s a few magic items hidden in your uniform. Even without me, you wouldn&#8217;t have succumbed to this man&#8217;s tricks.”</p><p>Zeid&#8217;s answer was a perfect score of one hundred points.</p> <p>Nodding her head, Ruina says without trying to hide it.</p><p>“Yes, as expected of you. That&#8217;s right. I had already detected Fonvu&#8217;s suspicious movements. And I could have left this place with Yui with the magic item of transfer.”</p><p>Ruina pulls out a round stone from her hem that is only the size of the first joint of her pinky finger, glowing red. It’s as if she’s saying this is it.</p> <p>Zeid describes her in his mind as shrewd.</p><p>“Incidentally, what I was calling out with my back hand was not the second and third armies which are already on the battlefield, but, as you may have guessed, the sixth through the tenth armies that are being newly assembled from the outside.”</p> <p>“You are very thorough. You have no mercy for betrayal.”</p> <p>“This battlefield is Yui&#8217;s debut, and it’s also a mop-up for those at risk of betrayal. For such me to lose? It&#8217;s impossible. It&#8217;s never going to happen.”</p> <p>“You like schemes”</p> <p>“Ah. However, it&#8217;s not scheming that I like. It&#8217;s about being above people.”</p><p>Ruina makes a clenched fist and holds it out to Zeid.</p> <p>It seems to indicate her firm determination.</p><p>“Now then, what are you going to do? More troops will gather here from the empire. Did you come to join the war at the request of the guild in anyway?”</p> <p>“Nn? No, I didn’t”</p> <p>&#8220;No matter how great Masked man-kun is, you probably won&#8217;t be able to take on Weira Empire&#8217;s 0th to 10th armies. Of course, I won&#8217;t let you go. ――Let me say it again, come to the Weira Empire.”</p> <p>“I&#8217;m not interested.”</p> <p>“No, you should come. Because ―― there will be no more guild in the near future.”</p><p>Ruina said with a fearless smile.</p> <p>There seemed to be no lie in her regal expression.</p> <p>That&#8217;s why Zeid&#8217;s eyes change.</p><p>“……What?”</p> <p>“Haha! ……You’ve given me sudden chills. As expected, even I too”</p> <p>“What do you mean by the guild being no more?”</p><p>Without even listening to Ruina&#8217;s chatter, Zeid interrupted and asked.</p><p>“……It&#8217;s simple. The human race will be united by the Weira Empire. To that end, guilds that dispatch forces to small countries like this will be an eyesore. That&#8217;s why I&#8217;m asking them to disappear.&#8221;</p><p>The Weira Empire has brought in prominent mercenary groups along with their organization.</p> <p>The result is an increase in their forces and the elimination of forces hostile to them.</p> <p>But while guilds can draw on human talents on an individual basis, they cannot buy them in on an organizational basis.</p> <p>The guild has declared its neutrality. In addition, attracted by the guild&#8217;s open atmosphere, high-quality human resources gather one after another from all over the country.</p> <p>Hence she can&#8217;t let it go any further unchecked.</p> <p>That’s why, she’s extinguishing it.</p> <p>She doesn&#8217;t want to go through the trouble of sending out requests for every war, paying for every war, and recruiting them for every war to join her side. It’s a wasteful consumption.</p> <p>So, she’s going to crush it.</p> <p>It&#8217;s plain and simple.</p> <p>However.</p> <p>To divulge that, she underestimated the feelings of the man in front of her had for the guild.</p> <p>Zeid lowers the young man on his shoulder.</p><p>“――Then, I guess I&#8217;ll just have to crush you guys right here.&#8221;</p> <p>“You’re not even going to try to hide who you are anymore. Good grief, I&#8217;m in trouble.”</p><p>Even though Ruina says that flatly, the sweat didn’t stop from flowing on her forehead.</p> <p>That feeling of intimidation.</p> <p>Just him being there seemed to make the planet tremble.</p> <p>Those who were nearby felt a sense of fatigue, as if their weight had increased many times over, as if they were being shot from the abdomen to the heart.</p> <p>The imperial troops who had begun to gather sensed this, and some soldiers instinctively ran away.</p><p>“Ze,Zeid…… you”</p> <p>“Don’t worry, I&#8217;ll transfer you guys back. I&#8217;ll handle the rest.”</p> <p>“『No way! That’s no good! You’re dealing with an army the size of the Weira Empire, you know!? 』”</p><p>While coughing, Sheila crawls out of the mud wall to stop Zeid.</p> <p>Quena seemed to agree with Sheila.</p><p>“As expected, you can’t overlook it. You even punched Fonvu to save the face of the guild, the Charisma Party. If that guild is going to be directly harmed, you can&#8217;t just stand by and watch.”</p><p>It was a gentle voice, as if to admonish him.</p> <p>The intimidating aura he had earlier was concealed in front of them.</p><p>“Then I will fight too.”</p> <p>“『Me too! I want to fight with Zeid!』”</p> <p>“Idiots. In those state, let alone fighting, it&#8217;s hard for you to even stand. Don&#8217;t overdo it.&#8221;</p> <p>“But, then……!”</p><p>Quena takes a snap at him.</p> <p>In fact, the two’s physical strength is near its limit. Quena is on the verge of depletion of her magic power, and Sheila has a lot of bleeding and damage from her wounds.</p><p>“Rest assured. I&#8217;m not going to lose in a place like this.&#8221;</p> <p>“…….Are we that unreliable? Are we that useless as members of your party &#8230;&#8230;?&#8221;</p><p>Quena says with eyes like an abandoned cat, holding back her tears.</p> <p>Feeling as if he were teasing a small animal, Zeid couldn&#8217;t stand to be there and scratched his cheek lightly.</p><p>“No, that isn’t the case. You guys have done enough. It&#8217;s the other way around, we&#8217;re in the same party, and I&#8217;m asking you to leave the rest to me.”</p><p>Quena was unconvinced by Zeid&#8217;s words.</p> <p>It felt as if it were a line he prepared to persuade her.</p> <p>Noticing this, Zeid continues.</p><p>“Don’t you know? I think of you guys as party members. You&#8217;re a reliable companion. Therefore, I&#8217;ll deal with this. Also, let’s carry out the next request together.&#8221;</p> <p>“……!”</p> <p>“『Zeid……!』”</p><p>He recognized them as members of the same party.</p> <p>It was a painful joy for Quena and Sheila.</p><p>“Alright, then you head back first”</p><p>Zeid puts his hand on their shoulder and mouths the word 『Transfer』.</p> <p>Quena and Sheila are eager to say some things, but they exude joy at being recognized by Zeid.</p><p>“I’ll be waiting, so”</p> <p>“『I’ll be cooking, so』”</p><p>The two girls conveyed each of their thoughts, and Zeid transitioned them to the royal capital of the Kingdom of Kuzehra. The young man with glasses was also transferred to the man at the stall.</p> <p>And then, Zeid once again turned his face to Ruina.</p> <p>A wary Yui pointed her sword at Zeid.</p><p>“Sounds like you&#8217;re really intending to fight.&#8221;</p> <p>“Of course. Just to be clear, how many armies does the Weira Empire have? So far, I&#8217;ve come up with ten, but”</p> <p>“I don&#8217;t think you need to know, though?&#8221;</p> <p>”Why?”</p> <p>“Why, is it……”</p><p>Ruina is puzzled by the pure tone of Zeid&#8217;s voice.</p> <p>However, she dared to answer.</p><p>“Fifteen. It means, about two-thirds of the Empire&#8217;s total army have gathered here.”</p> <p>“That&#8217;s a huge group.&#8221;</p> <p>“Ah. I was hoping that Fonvu, who was lying there, would expose more traitors. As a result, we were able to suppress it without much trouble.”</p> <p>“That seems to be so”</p><p>Zeid’s detection magic has caught the arrival of the 0th to 10th armies.</p> <p>The mountains on either side were covered all over with military flags with numbers inscribed on them indicating their respective corps and the flag of the Weira Imperial Army.</p> <p>The single main road is crowded all the way to the horizon.</p><p>“Look, this is the number of enemies you will face from now on.&#8221;</p><p>Ruina says intimidatingly with her hands outstretched. Countless soldiers were deployed behind her. She is truly an emperor who rules over everything.</p> <p>But Zeid extended his one hand, seemingly unconcerned about it.</p><p>“It&#8217;s a pain in the ass to have to deal with five army corps after I beat these guys.”</p> <p>&#8220;&#8230;.. I can’t believe you are able to say such a big thing after looking at this number.&#8221;</p> <p>“Well, for the meantime.”</p><p>Zeid puts his thumb and forefinger together.</p><p>“I&#8217;m going to choose whom I&#8217;m going to deal with.”</p> <p>“Ha. You want a one-on-one? War has no such sweetness――”</p><p>At the same time as Ruina said those words, Zeid snapped his fingers.</p> <p>A light snapping sound echoes.</p> <p>Some of it reverberated in the mountains. But it lingered in her ears for an oddly long time.</p> <p>Suddenly, Ruina felt a squeezing pain in her left chest, as if her heart had been gripped.</p><p>“Guuh……!”</p><p>Ruina unintentionally grasps her left chest.</p> <p>If she lets her guard down for even a moment, she will lose consciousness. Such a moment lasts about ten seconds.</p><p>“What…… did you do”</p><p>Ruina raises her face.</p> <p>The man with an inorganic mask was just looking around.</p><p>“Surprisingly, some remained.”</p> <p>“!?”</p><p>Ruina unintentionally also looked around the area.</p> <p>The army that was on the mountain, the army that was behind her.</p> <p>The number of national flags and military banners they were flying has clearly decreased. More than half of them.</p><p>“……What happened!”</p> <p>“Ruina-sama, magic power……”</p><p>Yui, standing in front of her, whispered so.</p> <p>It looked like she was trying to explain it, and Ruina encouraged her to continue by making eye contact.</p><p>“He interfered with the magic power of the soldiers by his own magic power and he exfoliated it. ……As a result, the soldiers fell because their magic powers were depleted.”</p> <p>“Wha,what do you mean……? In other words, you’re saying that he wiped out the magic power that the people possessed? Not by special magic, but by his pure magic power alone &#8230;&#8230;!?”</p><p>As expected, even Ruina cannot understand it.</p> <p>She has never heard of such a phenomenon. She can imagine some similar magic. However, Ruina does not know of any creature that can accomplish such feats through a mere manipulation of magic power.</p> <p>While they were having such conversation, several people flew in from afar.</p><p>“You monster!”</p><p>The second army corps commander, Iratsu. Behind him is his deputy military commander.</p> <p>The military chiefs and deputy chiefs class attack him from other directions as well.</p><p>“You’re late”</p><p>But Zeid easily brushes them off.</p> <p>When the attacking half falls to the ground, Ruina opens her mouth.</p><p>“Wait! That’s enough!”</p><p>There was a note of impatience in her voice.</p> <p>Their movement stops with a snap.</p><p>“This time we’re withdrawing.  I won&#8217;t let any more people get injured.”</p> <p>&#8220;However……!&#8221;</p><p>The second army commander, Iratsu, tries to utter a rebuttal.</p> <p>But his words didn&#8217;t continue.</p> <p>He can&#8217;t think of a way to defeat the masked monster.</p> <p>He hangs his head down naturally.</p> <p>But that wasn&#8217;t the problem.</p><p>“Who told you you could withdraw?&#8221;</p><p>Zeid told them coldly.</p><p>“Well, you can’t overlook us, huh”</p> <p>“Of course. You said you were going to destroy the guild. What reason would I have to overlook you?&#8221;</p><p>Their positions reversed completely.</p> <p>Ruina turns to Zeid.</p><p>“The guild is supposed to be just an intermediary organization. What&#8217;s the point of being so supportive of them?”</p> <p>“Ah, yeah. I guess it would be smarter for me to just shut up and watch. But the Guild is also the organization that saved me. It&#8217;s no wonder I feel obliged to them.”</p> <p>&#8220;I know Zeid very well. It was said that the working environment of the old Kingdom’s chivalric order was bad and that you were picked up by the guild. But so what? They took the talent they could snatch. That&#8217;s all there is to it. The guild didn&#8217;t save you. They just picked you up to use you.”</p><p>She was not saying this in order to survive.</p> <p>That was Ruina&#8217;s true feelings.</p> <p>In other words, she was recruiting Zeid.</p> <p>It&#8217;s the right thing to do as an organization.</p><p>“Ah, I know. I guess that&#8217;s the truth. But you know, until then, I had never felt anything from someone”</p> <p>“……is it something about a debt of gratitude?”</p> <p>“I was nearly chased to death by monsters and abused by the knights who made worked till I collapsed &#8230;&#8230; There were times when I wondered what I was living for. The guild was the first to treat me like a person. So even if it&#8217;s a one-sided feeling on my part, I want to return it.”</p><p>That was also Zeid&#8217;s true feelings.</p> <p>As a human, anyone can say that it is the right thing to do.</p> <p>Zeid&#8217;s straightforward words made Ruina smile.</p><p>“Fuh. I&#8217;ve been thinking about this ever since we met in the capital. ……I wish I was the first to find you before anyone else.&#8221;</p><p>Ruina walks up to Zeid.</p> <p>No hostility can be sensed in that action of hers.</p> <p>When they finally got close enough to touch each other, Ruina made Zeid show his face from only the lower half of his mask.</p> <p>Suddenly, Ruina brought her face close to his ―― and their lips met. It was a kiss.</p><p>“!!!!???”</p> <p>『!!!!!!????』</p><p>The people in the area watching such a spectacle gasped.</p> <p>The only sound that reaches the ears is the wind caressing the earth.</p> <p>To Zeid, who is ignorant of human contact, the time this took feels like an eternity. It starts to move when Ruina released him.</p><p>“――There would be several seats left vacant due to this betrayal. But all of that will not be enough for you. So I&#8217;m going to prepare the throne of an emperor for you.”</p> <p>“……Emperor?”</p><p>Zeid is still too agitated to think straight.</p> <p>But for the time being, he swallowed Ruina&#8217;s words and parroted it back.</p><p>“Ah, the king who rules the empire. Of course, next to you will be me, but you can have as many concubines as you wish. Leave the guild and come with me.”</p> <p>“……”</p><p>No one can read the expression on Zeid&#8217;s face as he wears a mask.</p> <p>Silence occupies the place.</p><p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/1491-728x1024.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1024" /></p><p>“Fufu, I don&#8217;t expect you to make up your mind right away. Let me hear your answer at some other time.”</p><p>Ruina turned her heel as she said so.</p> <p>However, Zeid is not so foolish as to be so easily evaded.</p><p>“Wa,wait. The guild is――”</p> <p>“――Ah, I take back what I said before. The guild will not be destroyed. That’s why, overlook me here. Zeid wouldn&#8217;t want to lose his future wife and country, would he?”</p><p>Ruina smiles boldly.</p> <p>Zeid was at a loss for a response to this scheme. Rather, he still hadn&#8217;t recovered from the shock of the kiss.</p> <p>Then the battered imperial troops began to retreat, while being wary of the unmoving Zeid.</p><p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p><p>“Oy, you! Masked man!”</p><p>I was stunned on the battlefield when a voice called out to me.</p> <p>I turned back casually and saw a familiar face.</p><p>“……slipper”</p> <p>&#8220;Why did you mention the name of a footwear? It&#8217;s Weeg, Weeg. I mean, isn&#8217;t that voice Zeid-aniki’s after all! That was such a great performance &#8230;&#8230;! As expected, you’re amazing!”</p> <p>&#8220;No&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m not Zeid.”</p> <p>“Ah, that&#8217;s right. You and Yui are in the same party, so you can’t make it public, right”</p><p>Weeg says apologetically.</p> <p>His atmosphere seems to have changed from before &#8230;&#8230; and he has become surprisingly attentive.</p> <p>However, I can&#8217;t admit it, so I neither nodded nor affirmed.</p><p>“But, why did you come? In such an overwhelmingly disadvantageous situation&#8230;&#8230; No, thanks to Zeid-aniki, the difference in strength was overturned at once, though. I never imagined you would be that strong!”</p> <p>“……Hmm. There’s no reason”</p> <p>“There you go again. You saved our country, so I’ll give you whatever reward you want! The country&#8217;s treasure trove was emptied due to the war, but&#8230;&#8230; I will definitely pay you!”</p> <p>“No, really, I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p><p>I&#8217;m not interested in rewards.</p> <p>My first priority is to leave quickly. I don&#8217;t want to stay too long and have my true identity revealed. No, it seems that quite a few people have already guessed it.</p> <p><em>Was my acting that bad &#8230;&#8230; (TN: LOL, yeah)</em></p><p>“Ah, it’s not a thing you want! Then what is it? Is it a land where you can excavate resources? Ha……! Or is it my little sister, Aishia &#8230;&#8230;!? E,even if it’s Zeid-aniki, I can’t give her!”</p> <p>“What the hell is that misunderstanding, you”</p> <p>“Certainly, when she saw Zeid-aniki in the castle, she became maiden-like and mumbled something like, 『Cool&#8230;&#8230; 』 but I, his brother, would not allow it!”</p> <p>“I said it’s different. ……I&#8217;m going home already.”</p> <p>“I,If it&#8217;s not my sister, then it&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; me! Tha,that&#8217;s ridiculous! But I can only assume so! Are you suggesting that you should have same-sex marriage with me, take the throne, and become a culturally tolerant and free countryーーー !!!!&#8221;</p><p>I left Weeg who seems to have become paranoid.</p> <p>I mouthed the word &#8220;transfer&#8221; and my vision brightened.</p>

<p><strong><a style= "text-decoration:none;" href="">Chapter 4 &#8211; The Aftermath of the Kiss</a></strong></p>

<p>To confess my mistake, I went to the Guildmaster&#8217;s office.</p> <p>In order to help the good old man, I drove the Weira Empire back. Moreover, my acting was so bad that my true identity was exposed&#8230;&#8230;</p> <p>Even though I&#8217;ve never even spoken to someone before, I shouldn&#8217;t have forced myself to lie.</p><p>“――So, with that said, I&#8217;m sorry for acting strangely.&#8221;</p> <p>“I don’t particularly care. Why are you being so serious?&#8221;</p> <p>“Eh, is that fine?”</p><p>Riff plainly said so.</p> <p>Rather, she seems to be suspicious, wondering 『Why are you reflecting like that? 』.</p><p>&#8220;If one has mischievously carried the guild&#8217;s sign on their back and began a conflict with the Weira Empire, then a punishment was to be considered.

And to save Yui, who is a member of the Charisma Party?”</p> <p>“Ah. As I said, it was not a request, though”</p> <p>“How can I blame those who tried to save their companions? In the first place, it happened in the process of fulfilling a request, so anything I’ll say doesn’t matter. Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p> <p>“……Sorry”</p> <p>&#8220;However, one thing is for sure. If there&#8217;s anything you need, just ask. We, the guild, will not become your enemies.

I was saving it for this occasion! It was in a hidden, unexplored area, so it was a lot of work.”</p> <p>“I see, so it’s the wisdom of the evil sword&#8230;&#8230;”</p> <p>“That’s what I’m saying. I guess that’s grandma&#8217;s bag of wisdom!”</p> <p>『Wait a minute. Who are you calling grandma? 』</p><p>While listening to such conversations,</p> <p>Sheila looks back at me with a flushed face.</p><p>“Now, Zeid is going to attack me since he can&#8217;t stand it anymore. Attack me!”</p><p>Sheila says cheerfully.</p> <p>However,</p><p>“……”</p> <p>“…………”</p> <p>“……”</p> <p>“……——No, it doesn&#8217;t have any effect, right?&#8221;</p> <p>『That’s stupid! Even the Demon King is said to have been effected by this hypnotic herb! 』</p><p>Sheila, whose atmosphere and the magic she wears have changed, and the evil sword, who has taken over her, said in surprise.</p> <p>But me and Quena kind of knew that.</p><p>“My body can digest a certain amount of poisons or anything else that could cause an anomaly.”</p> <p>“It was a predictable turn of events. You made light of the feral child named Zeid.&#8221;</p> <p>“No way…… my plans went out of order……”</p> <p>“What were you trying to do in my house in the first place &#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p><p>Quena said with a frown of annoyance.</p> <p>However, Sheila also seemed to have an opinion and lifted her well-groomed eyebrows.</p><p>“Is Quena okay with it!? Your sister beat you to it!”</p> <p>“Be,beat me to it, you said……!”</p><p>Quena looked at me with her face dyed with shame.</p> <p>Sheila then turns to me.</p><p>“Ze,Zeid, what do you think of me and Quena&#8230;&#8230;——!”</p> <p>“Excuse me.&#8221;</p><p>Covering Sheila&#8217;s words, Yui, who was hanging from the ceiling, called out to me. Her black hair dangles down along with gravity.</p> <p>Her breasts, which are oppressed by her military uniform but were asserting themselves, follow the gravity just as much as her hair.</p><p>“Hyu! Yu,yui-san! What do you want here!”</p><p>Sheila is terrified but she intimidated her.</p> <p>However, Yui didn&#8217;t care at all and got down behind me.</p><p>“Zeid. Request”</p> <p>“Ah, about the elf, huh. Are your wounds, okay? I thought we&#8217;d meet up first, though”</p> <p>“Hmm. My magic power is faint”</p> <p>&#8220;Other than that, I think you’re doing good. You should talk a little more, though…&#8230;”</p><p>She must have come after receiving the request from the Elf Branch with me.</p> <p>She was trespassing, but she didn&#8217;t care. As expected of a woman of her own pace.</p><p>“Mumumu……. Shall we continue where we left off from Stillbeats here!? Quena! Prepare for battle!”</p> <p>“As I said, what the hell are you gonna do at my house!?”</p> <p>“Zeid. Hurry”</p> <p>“Muki! Ignoring me is inexcusable! Prepare yourself!”</p> <p>“Ah, mou! This is my house!”</p> <p>“Obstacle”</p><p>The battle between the three begins again.</p> <p>In the meantime, I stopped by the kitchen and got another bowl of soup. It&#8217;s delicious.</p></spine>
