<p><strong><a style= "text-decoration:none;" href="">Chapter 1 &#8211; True Astea-Religion</a></strong></p>
<p>After the talk about the formation of the Charisma Party, we leave the Guildmaster&#8217;s office and go downstairs.</p> <p>Next to me were Sheila and Quena, who had participated in the conversation together.</p>  <p>“Umumu”</p>  <p>Sheila swelled her cheeks and leaked a dissatisfied voice.</p> <p>Next to me, Quena is also glaring at me reproachfully.</p>  <p>“If you’re gonna make a party, say it early.”</p> <p>“I&#8217;m sorry. Riff was smiling so happily that I couldn&#8217;t say anything.”</p> <div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 --> <div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div> <p>“That stupid guildmaster……”</p>  <p>Quena is cutting through the air with her arms, as if she is doing a small poking image training.</p> <p>Come to think of it, Quena and Riff seem to get along quite well, but I wonder what kind of relationship they have? <em>I don&#8217;t see that as simply a relationship about work, though.</em></p> <p>Suddenly, Sheila looked into my face.</p>  <p>“So, Zeid, you aren’t interested in having a party, are you?”</p> <p>“Hmmm, a party huh. Unless it was a story about putting together a party ordered directly from the guild. That&#8217;s why I entered the charisma party, but I&#8217;m not short of one as I have been, and I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;ll ever consider teaming up with one.”</p> <p>“Charisma Party huh……”</p>  <p>Sheila entered into thought with her finger on her chin.</p> <p>After all, in Riff&#8217;s opinion, both Sheila and Quena would have no problem joining the Charisma Party in terms of their ability.</p> <p>But in this Charisma party, ability is secondary. Their prestige gained so far will greatly influence the selection process.</p> <p>In terms of the guild, a rank of S is required, but only one person every year can achieve S rank. This year, since I have already become an S rank, the next S rank will be selected next year or later.</p> <p><em>If Quena or Sheila become S-rank in the next year or so, they can join, but&#8230;&#8230;</em></p> <p>I don&#8217;t think that this project has that much time to spare.</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 --> <div data-fuse="22386378219"></div> </div>  <p>“Well, Sheila will probably take a while to get to A rank, so I&#8217;ll be first to enter.”</p> <p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll be A rank next year.”</p> <p>“Really? At least in the Royal Capital, there are no requests, so it won’t be easy.”</p> <p>“Mumumu……!”</p>  <p>She seemed to be inciting her anger, but she was giving sound advice.</p> <p>Many of the requests in the royal capital were taken away by me.</p>  <p>“If it was on the remote area of the kingdom, you&#8217;ll get a lot of requests. Since I heard that the skirmishes they have with monsters are also terrible.”</p> <p>“Uhhm…… what about the Holy Republic? Aren&#8217;t they in rough shape because they&#8217;ve had two major monster attacks?”</p>  <p>Sheila asked.</p> <p>Quena is surprisingly well-informed, which seems to be to Sheila&#8217;s credit.</p> <div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 --> <div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div> <p>“No, they’re not. The Holy Republic has the military power the same as the major powers on the continent, even before they were suddenly attacked and damaged. Besides, the main force of Soria and others, who have been visiting the wounded in various parts of the country, have also returned.”</p> <p>“As expected of a neutral country&#8230;&#8230; they have the power to repel interference from other countries.”</p> <p>“Well, it&#8217;s a good thing that some monster contributed to its minimal damage.”</p>  <p><em>I wonder where is that monster.</em></p> <p>Quena&#8217;s gaze is fixed on me.</p>  <p>“I just took on the task of taking down a pack of monsters and making the empire and the dragons return home, though”</p> <p>“I’m saying that you are the monster, you know…… Anyway, as I said before, our target would be the frontier of the weakened kingdom of Kuzera. It seems that mercenaries from all over the world are gathering there, and the kingdom is willing to pay for it.”</p> <p>“But, leaving the royal capital means I won&#8217;t see Zeid for a while&#8230;&#8230;.”</p>  <p>Sheila has tears in her eyes. Her face is like that of a dog about to be abandoned<em>. I didn&#8217;t do anything, but that hurt my heart.</em></p> <p>Rather, if there is a request from the guild, I would also like to go to the frontier together with her.</p> <p>While I was thinking about this, I saw a group of people disputing at the reception desk for a request.</p> <div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 --> <div data-fuse="22386378225"></div> </div> <p>“Therefore, we cannot accept that request as the result of reviewing it &#8230;&#8230;.”</p> <p>“Wh,why! We descended from a noble birth……!”</p>  <p>Leading the way, is a green-haired girl in her early teens.</p> <p>The others are sparse in age and gender. Some are young women, some are old men.</p>  <p>“What, is that”</p> <p>“They’re a cult calling themselves 『True Astea-Religion』, which has become very active recently. Perhaps they&#8217;re here to make a request.”</p>  <p>Quena responded to my mutterings.</p>  <p>“True Astea-Religion?”</p> <p>“Yes. They’re a group of people who claim that the Astea Religion that the Holy Republic has adopted as its state religion is a fake and that they are the real thing.”</p> <p>“Heh. Why are they in the guild again?”</p> <p>“I guess they want the guild to help them do missionary work? But the guild doesn&#8217;t give preferential treatment to only one power, and if you say Astea, it&#8217;s the religion to which Soria belongs. The guild doesn&#8217;t want to cause any more problems with that.”</p>  <p>Quena made me convinced.</p> <p>Soria is an S-rank of the guild and they want to be considerate of her because of the Charisma party formation.</p>  <p>“……Just in case, shall I give you a warning?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 --> <div data-fuse="22386378225"></div> </div>  <p>Quena stares at me with a <em>jih~</em> look.</p>  <p>“What do you mean?”</p> <p>“You don’t understand huh……. I&#8217;m telling you, that don&#8217;t get involved in anything strange. Also, I feel like weird things are happening around you. &#8230;&#8230;”</p> <p>“That’s a misunderstanding. Even without me, problems are occurring every day.”</p> <p>&#8220;The degree of the problems is different, you know.”</p>  <p>Quena quipped at me.</p> <p>Well, I mean, it&#8217;s so worrying that the guild turned them down. <em>I&#8217;m not going to poke at them thoughtlessly either, though.</em></p> <p>The group of people claiming to be the True Astea-Religion went outside.</p>  <p>“Well then, I&#8217;m off to the frontier of the kingdom to take up a request or something! I&#8217;ll be back after finishing my frontier requests in no time, Zeid!”</p>  <p>Sheila says, pointing at me with a <em>bishi*</em>. <em>(TN: SFX)</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 --> <div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div> <p>It looks like she really intends to save points to take the S-rank exam next year. If that&#8217;s her intention, then there&#8217;s nothing for me to say anything about it.</p> <p>At any rate, I waved my hand and told her to do her best.</p>  <p>“I guess I&#8217;ll follow Sheila then.”</p> <p>“Nn, you too?”</p> <p>“Yes. Well then, I&#8217;m not Sheila, but wait for me, Zeid.”</p> <p>“Oh”</p>  <p>Quena is also working hard.</p> <p>Perhaps because joining the Charisma party would increase the chances of her getting looked back on by her sister.</p> <p>Now then, I wonder what should I do.<em>(TN: Gather Harem members)</em></p>
<p style= "text-align:center;">☆☆☆☆</p>
<p>After Quena and Sheila went to the frontier, I was still alone, looking at the guild&#8217;s huge bulletin board.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 --> <div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div> <p>The number of requests has increased from before, but nothing comes to my mind.</p> <p>I guess I&#8217;ll take another D or C request as appropriate. &#8230;&#8230;</p>  <p>(……Hmm)</p>  <p>However, the number of adventurers has begun to increase in the Royal Capital as well.</p> <p><em>I wonder if it would be bad manners for me to take another request here.</em></p> <p>If it&#8217;s money, I can afford it. At least I won&#8217;t die because of money.</p> <p>I guess I&#8217;ll go on cool time for a while. I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll get some more nomination requests or emergency requests.</p> <p>If it doesn&#8217;t come, I can go to the frontier like Quena and Sheila. Or to the guild branches in the other countries.</p> <p><em>Let&#8217;s goof around at the inn for the first time in a while.</em></p> <p>With these thoughts in mind, I enter a street full of street vendors on my way to the inn. Although it’s not as lively or has as many stores as at the festival, a wide variety of things are being sold here.</p> <p>One of them was selling my favorite meat skewers.</p>  <p>“Uncle, give me three&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div> <p>“Sure. It’s three copper coins, but Zeid boya is always helping us, so I’ll make it two. It might just be a bit of money for you, though. Gahahaha!”</p>  <p>The affable old man gave me an extra. I get a skewer of meat that has been pre-made but is still hot.</p> <p>I put one in my mouth. It’s delicious.</p> <p>Suddenly, I spotted a group of people handing out flyers on the way.</p> <p>These were the people whose request had been turned down by the guild.</p>  <p>(They&#8217;re enthusiastic)</p>  <p>With that thought in mind, I tuck into my second meat skewer.</p> <p>But I was told not to get involved with them. It&#8217;s not a good idea to be handed out with flyers or to be solicited by strange people.</p> <p><em>Let’s go a little off the road and go to the back alley</em> ―― just when I thought so.</p>  <p>“Get out of the way! You’re annoying, shit!”</p> <p>“I,I’m sorry”</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div> <p>“Geez, even though I&#8217;m about to go to work, you&#8217;re handing out something like shit!”</p>  <p>A girl was pushed by a man walking in the street.</p> <p>No matter how much of a hindrance they were, they weren’t overly solicitous.</p> <p>And the path is wide enough for one man to pass. The man seemed to be the one at fault between the two.</p> <p>As expected, the members of the group surround the man who went to hit the girl.</p> <p>He was outnumbered.</p> <p>The man didn&#8217;t seem to have sensed such a situation.</p>  <p>“Wha,what is this”</p> <p>“You bastard…… How dare you, Sufi-sama!”</p> <p>“Please wait!”</p>  <p>The girl who fell in what could be called an explosive situation stopped them.</p> <p>The men obeyed her.</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>  <p>“I&#8217;m sorry, sir. I&#8217;ll try to not be a hindrance as much as possible.”</p>  <p>I thought she would be angry, but the girl bowed her head to the man and apologized.</p> <p>The man sniffs awkwardly and leaves.</p>  <p>“A,are you all right, Sufi-sama?”</p>  <p>Several people were already there to take care of her, but more people gathered as if to surround the girl called Sufi. The girl does not appear to be seriously injured.</p> <p>It&#8217;s just an abrasion by the looks of it.</p>  <p>“If it’s only this, then I’m fine. Let&#8217;s do more missionary work rather than that. It&#8217;s bad if this is left as it is. More &#8230;&#8230; more quickly.”</p>  <p>Her face was somewhat —— desperate.</p> <p>I ate the third meat skewer.</p><p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/0111.jpg" alt="" width="1342" height="1888" /></p>  <p>Their missionary work could be seen from the windows of the inn.</p> <p>I was vaguely gazing at their figures.</p> <p><em>I wonder if this is an organization that I should not get involved with as much as Quena says.</em></p> <p>They say that they don’t give preferential treatment to only one force &#8230;&#8230;, but I could at least help them with missionary work, right? <em>Then the fact that the saint of the Charisma party is Soria will lead to missionary work.</em></p> <p>&#8230;&#8230;I&#8217;m bored, so that&#8217;s what I&#8217;m thinking about.</p> <p>But of course, I&#8217;m an S-rank, so I&#8217;ll have some influence<em>. It might become a big deal if I were to back them up.</em></p> <p>I can&#8217;t be a nuisance to the guild.</p> <p>It&#8217;s not good for me to get involved with them as &#8220;me&#8221;.</p> <p>But I wonder what the reasons are for these women to go to such lengths to deny Astea-religion.</p> <p><em>I&#8217;m itching. I&#8217;d like to hear about it. &#8230;&#8230;</em></p> <p>……it’s like that. So when I noticed that masks were for sale at a nearby stall.</p> <p>I thought I saw a surprise mark floating above my head.</p>
<p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p>  <p>The next day. The religious group was still eagerly soliciting.</p> <p>So I decided to at least talk to them, with the idea I came up with yesterday.</p> <p>I buy an unadorned white mask with hollowed-out eyes.</p> <p>I could have gone with something more novel, but this mask was the cheapest, so I went with it.</p> <p>I put the strings of the mask over my ears, tie them around my head in a knot, and break into their group, which is enthusiastic about their missionary work.</p>  <p>“Here you go!”</p>  <p>One of the believers hands me a leaflet with a smiling face.</p> <p><em>I wonder how could he talk to such a masked person with full-blown suspiciousness. </em></p> <p>But here I take it obediently. <em>(TN: By the way, I don’t know the gender of the believer here, so it’s a “he” for now)</em></p> <p>The flyer says in large letters “True Astea Religion”. It also includes the true method of praying to the Goddess and how to recognize the correct Goddess statue.</p>  <p>“I&#8217;m sorry, can I talk to you for a second?”</p>  <p>Like that, I call out to them.</p> <p>Then the believer who handed me the leaflet tilted his head with the same smile.</p>  <p>“Yes, what is it?”</p> <p>“I don&#8217;t know much about this Astea goddess, but is she really real?”</p> <p>“Yes, she exists. Because the dignitaries of the past heroic parties actually had an audience with her and gave a prayer to her directly.”</p> <p>“Gave a prayer? What do you mean?”</p> <p>“In this case, giving a prayer means that one’s magic power is taken away. The prayer rides on the magic power and heads for Goddess Astea-sama.”</p> <p>“……I see”</p>  <p>The idea of magic power being sucked out of you is terrifying. <em>Because it means that you were being deprived of your power.</em></p> <p>But the Goddess has probably saved human beings and other races many times.</p> <p>That track record makes her less creepy.</p> <p><em>Astea religion and True Astea religion …….</em></p> <p>I&#8217;m extraordinarily interested in it because I still am a man of leisure.</p>  <p>“So do you have any evidence that you are really praying to Astea?”</p>  <p>The main point is this.</p>  <p>“……We have no evidence”</p>  <p>The man gritted his teeth in frustration.</p> <p>If they don&#8217;t have it, then I can’t believe it.</p> <p>In that case, it would be of human psychology to support the majority which is the Astea religion.</p>  <p>“However, the recent shoddy treatment and bad publicity of Astea believers has become widespread. For me to say that, I was originally a believer of the Astea religion.”</p> <p>“Hmm, you were a former believer, huh”</p>  <p>Then it’s not entirely without credibility.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve never been interested in religion, so I&#8217;ve never heard of bad things about them myself.</p>  <p>“How is it!? You, too, must become a True Astea!”</p>  <p>The believer approaches me.</p> <p>His spirit of solicitation is strong.</p>  <p>“I&#8217;m sorry, but I&#8217;m not interested now——”</p> <p>&#8220;Damn heathens! You&#8217;re blocking my path again!”</p>  <p>A familiar voice of a man rings out.</p> <p>He seemed more irritated than yesterday, and this time, he threw a stone. The stone was small, but it hit the forehead of the girl who was doing missionary work.</p>  <p>“Kyah”</p> <p>“A,are you okay, Sufi-sama!”</p> <p>“You son of a bitch! How dare you attack Sufi-sama!”</p>  <p>The girl gives a little scream and puts her butt on the ground.</p> <p>It seems that he’ll be making it tough again.</p> <p>As expected, he has gone too far this time. Everyone&#8217;s blood is rushing to their heads. Even the people who have stalls or happen to be passing by, are giving the man hostile gazes.</p> <p>The man is about to get beaten.</p> <p>However,</p>  <p>“I,I’m fine”</p>  <p>The girl hurriedly stops them.</p> <p>Everyone stopped moving in response.</p>  <p>(The situation is different from yesterday. It&#8217;s bad behavior no matter how you look at it, and yet you still stop it.)</p>  <p>The space on the road was vacant this time as well, and it seemed that the solicitation wasn’t a hindrance. Clearly, the man was an incessant complainer of sorts.</p> <p>I even marveled at the girl&#8217;s magnanimity.</p> <p>Moreover, no one in this place ignored the girl. Her dignified voice harbored her innate charisma.</p>  <p>“I’m sorry. It&#8217;s not that we&#8217;re blocking the way, it&#8217;s just that we&#8217;re doing missionary work.”</p> <p>“A,ah……”</p>  <p>The man nodded his head, as if he was embarrassed.</p> <p>This is because the girl called Sufi had blood running from her forehead.</p> <p>Perhaps he is calmly reflecting on what he did.</p>  <p>“Then, I am sorry. But we will continue to disturb you. As it is now, the world is moving in the wrong direction. We must continue to work to prevent that from happening.”</p>  <p>Like that, the girl said honestly.</p> <p>She apologized clearly, and then he made up his mind and asked.</p>  <p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; How can you be so dignified. How can you stand against the greatest religion of all, Astea Religion!”</p> <p>&#8220;Because the Astea Religion is wrong.”</p> <p>“How can that be!? Only strange people are on your side! In fact, the only person who is even picking up the leaflets you’re handing is that guy with the suspicious white mask on!”</p>  <p>&#8230;&#8230; A suspicious white mask?</p> <p>I look around, but I&#8217;m the only one there.</p> <p><em>Yeah, that&#8217;s me, right.</em></p> <p>No, well, that’s …… sorry.</p>  <p>“No. Although they are not many right now, those who distrust the current state of Astea religion are joining True Astea-religion. Not only that, but we&#8217;ve had more than a few people who weren&#8217;t interested in the religion, to begin with, listening to us.”</p> <p>“So,someone is viewing at you!?”</p> <p>“If you keep raising your voice, you will get some kind of response. Whether it’s positive or negative. Even if it seems annoying, we do what we think is right. If it&#8217;s right, it will be supported, and if it&#8217;s wrong, we will never see the light of day.”</p> <p>“……Kuh”</p>  <p>The man turns his face down.</p> <p>His hands seem to be filled with strength from his frustration.</p>  <p>“Is there, something you didn&#8217;t like?&#8221;</p>  <p>The girl asked gently.</p> <p>The man nodded, shivering.</p>  <p>“Ah. I have a boss who’s like a jerk at work. Pecking around and making ingratiating smile all day, every day. &#8230;&#8230; I spend my time thinking that it can&#8217;t be helped for the sake of my family. But if I keep doing this, I&#8217;m afraid I&#8217;m going to break myself someday. &#8230;&#8230; And then people like you, who are in a vulnerable position and yet stand tall, showed up, and I got angry out of spite.”</p>  <p>The man revealed his own feelings.</p> <p>The young girl was accepting such a man, ministering him with &#8220;Yes, yes.”.</p> <p><em>I see.</em></p> <p>At least I don&#8217;t feel bad. I&#8217;m starting to get a little more interested in the True Astea religion.</p>  <p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p>  <p>It has been several days since I began to watch the sincere activities of the True Astea religion.</p> <p>Apparently, the girl named Sufi is the central figure in the True Astea religion.</p> <p>These woman and her company are still enthusiastically engaged in missionary work based in the Kingdom today.</p> <p><em>I guess it’s easier to gather believers in this rugged land, which still has ongoing disputes with other countries.</em></p> <p>As I was thinking about this, my adventurer card started quivering and shaking.</p> <p>When I checked it, it seemed that Riff was calling me.</p> <p>After making appropriate preparations, I headed to the guild.</p>  <p style="text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p>  <p>“Sorry to call you out on such short notice.”</p>  <p>When I arrived at the guildmaster&#8217;s office, Riff greeted me in her chair, looking the same.</p> <p>I take my seat for the time being.</p>  <p>“You do it all the time. So, what&#8217;s the matter?&#8221;</p> <p>“Umu, it&#8217;s an urgent request. Moreover, it’s greater than an A rank.”</p> <p>&#8220;Oh, it&#8217;s been a while. What&#8217;s up this time?”</p> <p>“……There aren&#8217;t many people who respond to A-rank requests with such a nonchalant attitude.”</p> <p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t that always the case?&#8221;</p> <p>“You say to yourself. No, well, it&#8217;s true, but &#8230;&#8230;”</p>  <p>It&#8217;s my usual conversation with Riff, who seems to be beyond dumbfounded.</p> <p>Even if our positions were reversed, Riff would have the same attitude as me.</p> <p>She was too tired to do so when she pulled me out of the Chivalric Order, but she too has bottomless power.</p> <p>This little girl is terrifying.</p>  <p>“The content of the request is to assist in a dispute that is taking place on the border between the kingdom and the demon territory.”</p> <p>“Hmm, dispute?”</p>  <p>I had heard that the demon tribe and the human tribe had been in a period of no conflict.</p> <p>Even if there is, it would only be skirmishes. <em>But I wonder what that dispute means.</em></p>  <p>“Actually, the movement of some demons is becoming active. I don&#8217;t know how big it is, but rumor has it that even one of the seven great demon clans is moving &#8230;&#8230;”</p> <p>“Hoh. I see.”</p> <p>“Well, it&#8217;s just a rumor.”</p>  <p>I am not familiar with the demon tribe.</p> <p>So it’s natural that I don&#8217;t understand what those seven great demon aristocrats are either.</p> <p>However, if they’re powerful enough to get into conflict with Kingdoms that have major power, I guess they aren’t fools.</p>  <p>“But the kingdom employs quite a few mercenaries, don’t they? Is that not enough?”</p> <p>“I hear that the demons are gaining so much power that they are overwhelming even the most prominent mercenary groups. It appears that they have an ability that is incomparable to the past.”</p> <p>“Ho, that&#8217;s what&#8217;s going on, huh”</p>  <p><em>Does this mean that they have been training insanely well during those peaceful periods?</em></p> <p>Besides, the kingdom side has been drained of its forces due to the troubles it has been having with the other countries.</p> <p>Either way, it seems to be a bad situation.</p>  <p>“Now that we&#8217;ve settled the matter, can I ask you a question? Why aren&#8217;t you accepting requests from the True Astea religion? A request is a request, no matter how shady one is.”</p>  <p>When I asked, Riff made a complicated look.</p> <p><em>As I thought, there must be something going on.</em></p>  <p>“Look, there&#8217;s that Charisma party we had talked about, right”</p> <p>“That, huh. That&#8217;s the one where you named me and Soria as members tentatively”</p> <p>“Umu. That Soria has been an active member of the Astea Religion since she was a child. She has the backing of Astea religion and the track record she has built up in the religion”</p> <p>“……Ah, I understand”</p>  <p>It’s just as Quena predicted. Since they were recruiting Soria, I guess they want to be as close to the Astea Religion as possible.</p> <p>That&#8217;s why, they can&#8217;t get involved with the hostile True Astea Religion.</p> <p>Even though their official stance is that they are forbidden to be in favor of a particular force, there are degrees of attachment.</p> <p>Then, it can&#8217;t be helped.</p> <p>I cross my arms behind my back and look at the ceiling while letting my head fall.</p>  <p>“But I don&#8217;t think that the true Astea-Religion folks are bad either.”</p>  <p>She blurted that out.</p>  <p>“I understand what you mean. The notoriety of the Astea religion has reached my ears.”</p> <p>“Do they have a bad reputation after all?”</p> <p>“And it&#8217;s only recently that they didn&#8217;t even try to hide it. They even have some remarks that are conspicuous, such as asking for excessive offerings and even ridiculing the goddess Astea in some way.”</p> <p>“Uwah, seriously”</p>  <p>Riff&#8217;s face contorted as if to say that she hates it from the depths of her heart.</p> <p>She also said that if it weren&#8217;t for the Soria situation, she wouldn&#8217;t be too interested in getting along with them.</p> <p>Or rather, if that&#8217;s the case, then maybe what the True Astea Religion was saying is true.</p> <p>Well, that doesn&#8217;t mean I can help them with missionary work.</p> <p>I am also a member of the guild. I can never do anything that would cause trouble for them.</p> <p><em>Besides, the True Astea religion will gather support even if I don&#8217;t give them a hand.</em></p> <p>Looking at that little girl named Sufi, I thought so.</p>  <p>“Well, unless, of course, Soria could find some new backing or another prestige-enhancing achievement, it’ll be different.”</p>  <p>Riff turns a challenging eye at me.</p> <p>She seemed to be expecting something from me.</p> <p><em>Does that mean I am to help the True Astea religion?</em></p>  <p>“&#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s a pain in the ass so I&#8217;m not moving. I&#8217;ll do it if I have some free time and some interest at the time.”</p>  <p>My nature is laziness.</p> <p>It’s just my black guts being dyed deeply.</p> <p>So unless it&#8217;s work, and unless I have too much free time to do it, I won&#8217;t move aggressively. <em>It depends on my mood, though.</em></p> <p>I went to talk to Sufi and her other companions, which is called an irregularity for me.</p>  <p>“Is that so. I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;ll do something about it, as usual, though.”</p> <p>“I’m not doing anything. It’s just…… my surroundings moving around on their own……”</p> <p>“You were getting quieter towards the end. You seem to lack confidence.”</p> <p>“Shut up”</p>  <p>Grinning, Riff looks at me with amusement.</p> <p>She then held out a piece of paper written with an urgent request in hand.</p> <p>I took the paper as if to snatch it away from her, while looking away from her because it was difficult for me to make eye contact.</p>

<p><strong><a style= "text-decoration:none;" href="">Chapter 2 &#8211; Encounter</a></strong></p>

<p>The peace that had been going on for some time was coming to an end, and the boundaries of the kingdom of Kuzehra were changing.</p> <p>In pursuit of the invading countries, the demon tribes took advantage of the civil war happening in the Kingdom of Kuzehra.</p> <p>The human race and the demon tribe have a truce agreement that they will not engage in a conflict of such scale that it would involve the entire race in an 『all-out war』.</p> <p>If a conflict were to start on the scale of one of the seven great demon noble families and one nation, it is said that the other seven great demon noble families and the nations of the human race should not interfere in the battle between the two to avoid an all-out war.</p> <p>However, in the current conflict, human nations had invaded the kingdom of Kuzehra at the same time as the demons.</p> <p>Led by the empire that boasts one of the most powerful militaries among the great powers in terms of both quality and quantity, even smaller countries were working to rewrite their borders.</p> <p>In the desperate situation, the invasion stopped when 30% of the territory was eroded due to the strenuous fighting on the part of the kingdom, but the second wave began immediately.</p> <p>And the war situation is being pushed to the kingdom’s side. Their opponent is the demon tribe.</p> <p>&#8220;You’re kidding me! The Crimson Lion Mercenary Corps have been killed!”</p> <p>“The mercenary corps of Order and Disorder who came as reinforcements!?”</p> <p>“It&#8217;s too late!

It was a pendant sold by the Astea religion, which they can use to offer a prayer to the goddess Astea.</p> <p>Although it’s weak, the magic power of the soldier is sucked into the pendant.</p> <p>This was the reason why the goddess Astea was said to exist.</p> <p>And soldiers on the battlefield believe in it even to the point of reducing their magic power which is their &#8220;ability&#8221;. ――In order to give it to the goddess Astea, who caused miracles many times.</p> <p>However,</p>  <p>“Fuhahaha!

Would you please move your hand rather than your mouth.”</p>  <p>It was Sufi.</p> <p>She was from a rising religion and was unwelcome since she was in direct opposition to the largest Astea religion.</p> <p>The two people who had been fighting, as expected, also looked at Sufi with contempt.</p>  <p>“Hah, I won’t listen to single a word from a girl who is trying to get a share of profit from the Astea religion!”</p> <p>“This is not the time to talk about such things. We need to tend to the wounded first.”</p>  <p>While returning these words, Sufi was using the best healing magic she could use.</p> <p>The man glared at her while clicking his tongue, while paying no attention to his attitude.</p>  <p>“Hah, you don&#8217;t even care if your religion is mocked! You see your followers as nothing more than a money pit!!?”</p><p>“Please stop right there.

Behind her are several knights acting as her escorts.</p>  <p>“So,Soria-sama……!”</p>  <p>The lines of sight of the people in the area were nailed at her.</p> <p>Even the groans of the wounded disappeared.</p>  <p>&#8220;Wide-area recovery (Ex-heal)”</p>  <p>With such a murmur from Soria, she generated a wave of magic power.</p> <p>The wounds of people hit by the waves healed. Even their slightest scratches.</p>  <p>“You did not come here to fight. Move your hands rather than your mouth.”</p> <p>““Ye,yes!””</p>  <p>At Soria&#8217;s words, the men nodded their heads as if they were children being scolded.</p>  <p>“I’m sorry. Thank you very much.”</p>  <p>Sufi bowed her head in gratitude.</p> <p>Seeing this, Soria also smiles.</p>  <p>“Sufi-san…… right? From the true Astea-religion. I wanted to meet you. We&#8217;ve always been passing each other on volunteer work in war zones. I thought I would see you at the next Great Holy Prayer Place, but it was a great honor that I met you sooner. My name is Soria. Pleased to make your acquaintance.”</p>  <p>Soria.</p> <p>It was not an uncommon name. If one looks for it, there could be at least one who has it in one village.</p> <p>But there is only one person on this continent who comes to mind with just the name Soria.</p> <p>The head priestess of the Astea Church, an S-rank adventurer of the Guild, the 【Saint of the Light Star】 ————</p> <p>She is a girl who is guaranteed to go down in history with many aliases and legends.</p> <p>Many people worship Soria Aiden instead of the goddess Astea.</p> <p>She is considered to be a 『hope』 alongside the successive generations of heroes.</p>  <p>“Nice to meet you, I&#8217;m Sufi. I’m a high priest in the True Astea-religion. Actually, I would have liked to speak with Soria-sama myself.”</p>  <p>The healing of the wounded who had just been carried in had just been completed.</p> <p>There was plenty of time for both of them.</p>  <p>“Speak with me?”</p>  <p>Hence, Soria also asks Sufi back.</p> <p>There was no hostility. Rather, she could sense goodwill from Soria. Despite the fact that the two organizations are hostile to each other.</p> <p>Soria had heard it many times. About the actions of the True Astea religion.</p> <p>Rather, it was because Soria was often on the front lines that she knew about the serious activities of Sufi and her comrades.</p>  <p>“Yes. Soria-sama…… you are worshipping the Goddess Astea-sama, right?”</p> <p>“Indeed. I’m a devotee of Astea Religion”</p> <p>“Excuse my impoliteness for asking this……. What do you think about your faith?”</p> <p>“What do I think, is it?”</p>  <p>She tilts her head, unable to gauge the true meaning of her question.</p> <p>Sufi asks while crunching her words again.</p>  <p>“For example, you had a connection with Astea-sama, or you found a lesson that made you convinced, or you found a passage in the scriptures that you liked. &#8230;&#8230;or something like that. I wanted to ask you for something like your reason to believe.”</p>  <p>Of course, Sufi knows that there are also people who believe in Her without deep reason.</p> <p>However, Soria&#8217;s activities are far beyond the scope of what can be accomplished with the motive of faith.</p> <p>She wanted to know why she could put so much effort into it.</p>  <p>“So,so that’s what you mean. Ye,yes, I, I se……e”</p>  <p>Soria nodded repeatedly, clearly agitated.</p> <p>Her face is dyed in vermilion ――― she reacts like a maiden in love.</p>  <p>When Sufi was having trouble reacting, Soria made a single coughing sound to get herself back on track.</p>  <p>“I, I believe in 『hope』 rather than in faith.”</p> <p>“Hope……?”</p>  <p>Sufi tilts her head this time at her somewhat unexpected response.</p>  <p>“Is it about the miracles that Astea-sama performs?”</p> <p>“Yes, there is that too”</p> <p>“……?”</p>  <p>Sufi further tilted her head at the intent of Soria&#8217;s words, which she could not grasp even if she tried.</p> <p>Soria saw this and smiled apologetically and bitterly with gratitude.</p>  <p>“I’m sorry. A miracle happened when I was just a beginner. It was simply at that time that I began to have casual faith in Astea-sama.”</p> <p>“That happened huh”</p>  <p>Sufi thinks about it.</p> <p><em>The religion and coincidences have combined</em>, like so, she thought that that perception might be correct.</p> <p>However, the fact that she mentioned 『hope』 without mentioning Astea’s name doesn’t seem to be a pattern of a strong subjective impression.</p> <p>She has faith with a firm focus on reality.</p>  <p>“I&#8217;ll ask you something, but what is that miracle&#8230;&#8230;.? And hope you were talking about&#8230;&#8230;”</p> <p>“Tha,tha,that’s……!”</p>  <p>Soria&#8217;s face turns red from shame again.</p> <p>But before Soria could answer, she was interrupted.</p>  <p>“Hahaha, what&#8217;s this? Isn&#8217;t this the true Astea cult? Are you coming to the war zone to brainwash people again? You never learn, do you?”</p>  <p>A man with blue hair and dressed in a grand priestly outfit approached the two.</p>  <p>“……Zai Fonde-san”</p>  <p>Zai Fonde. The Archpriest of the Astea religion.</p> <p>He looks like he is in his mid-thirties, which isn’t suited to his title. He is quite young.</p> <p>The archpriest of the Astea church interrupted them from the side.</p> <p>Sufi, and Soria too, looked at Fonde with modest disgust.</p>  <p>“Why, are you here?”</p>  <p>Soria asked.</p> <p>It was a genuine question.</p> <p>No one doubts the fact that Soria, who is often on the front lines, is here. This is because the main force is under Soria in the first place.</p> <p>And, in fact, thanks to that, the number of Astea believers have increased.</p> <p>Some believers volunteer to see Soria, who is moving energetically in the field, as a force to maintain the neutrality of the Holy Republic, while others contribute through trading, by making use of their connections between other believers.</p> <p>Moreover, some countries are so indebted to Soria&#8217;s activities that they provide generous aid to the Holy Republic.</p> <p>Soria&#8217;s presence on the front lines benefits both the Astea religion and the Holy Republic.</p> <p>However, the Archpriest seldom goes to the front lines himself.</p>  <p>“It’s for a minor business, Soria-san”</p>  <p>The Archpriest Zai replies with a broad surface smile.</p> <p>However, Zai only has two escorts.</p> <p>And they’re not knights, but soldiers without much equipment.</p>  <p>“You&#8217;re out here on a minor business with just that much equipment and personnel?”</p>  <p>Behind Soria, the 【Sword Saint】 Fir Eige asked.</p> <p>In Fir&#8217;s eyes, the soldiers were not well trained. They were not trained to be escorts.</p>  <p>“Haha, don&#8217;t worry. More than that, the heathens are glaring at us. You shouldn&#8217;t get involved with these kinds of people.”</p>  <p>It is not the members of the Astea cult who are being glared at. It’s only Zai, the Archpriest.</p> <p>In fact, the atmosphere was loose until a few minutes ago.</p>  <p>“Let’s see, Sufi, was it? It’s fine to take a spill of Astea religion. I&#8217;m generous, so I&#8217;ll forgive you up to that point. But you shouldn&#8217;t get too carried away ――”</p>  <p>He brings his face close to Sufi&#8217;s with a smile on his face.</p> <p>Then he utters in a small voice.</p>  <p>“―― You don&#8217;t want to end up like your parents, do you?”</p> <p>“――――&#8230;&#8230;!”</p>  <p>Sufi, who had been soft and mild-mannered earlier, suddenly changed her expression to a mixture of anger and tears.</p> <p>A True Astea religion believer, who was standing in the back, steps in front of Sufi and glares at the Archpriest.</p>  <p>“You bastard!”</p> <p>“Oops, want to hit me?”</p> <p>“That’s needless to say!”</p> <p>“……Please wait!”</p>  <p>Sufi stood still.</p> <p>It was the right decision.</p>  <p>“Hahaha. You won’t hit me huh. That&#8217;s boring.”</p>  <p>The Archpriest agitated him as if to corner him, but this time, Sufi did not show any reaction.</p> <p>She firmly stopped her believer.</p>  <p>“Wh,why. This guy……!”</p> <p>“Seen from the side, it would be just a one-sided beating.”</p> <p>“……!”</p>  <p>The man who is a believer exhaled when Sufi told him so.</p> <p>If they mess with him here, they’ll lose.</p>  <p>“And this kind of violence doesn&#8217;t produce anything. It only makes your hands dirty.”</p>  <p>Sufi does not oppose violence. In the first place, Astea Religion and True Astea Religion do not reject violence.</p> <p>However, they must use common sense to determine when to use violence.</p>  <p>“You can’t say anything, huh. Rather, it&#8217;s an honor for weak heretics like you guys to be able touch me. ――――”</p> <p>『The guys in areas 2 and 3 will be carried in!』</p>  <p>The voice of the liaison soldier echoed blocking Zai&#8217;s words.</p> <p>A reply flies in response.</p>  <p>『Wha……! Then, what happened to the second and third areas!? 』</p>  <p>The tone of his voice was tinged with anxiety.</p> <p>The wounded will be brought in when the battlefield has receded or settled down.</p> <p>However, the areas 2 and 3 are also on the front lines.</p> <p>It will be the main battleground of this conflict, so to speak.</p> <p>There can never be an end to the fight there. Therefore, it means that they inevitably retreated.</p> <p>But if that happens, the frontline will collapse at once and the enemy will rush to the rear ――.</p>  <p>『Don&#8217;t worry! It seems that an adventurer dispatched by the guild has taken over the second and third areas! 』</p> <p>『Ha,hah!? Two areas at once!?』</p> <p>『Ah, his name was Zeid, apparently!』</p>  <p>A lot of people were familiar with the name.</p> <p>In fact, the Sword Saint Fir frowned unpleasantly.</p> <p>But the most responsive was,</p>  <p>“Ze,Ze,Ze,Zeid-san!?”</p> <p>“Sa,Saviour-sama!?”</p>  <p>It was Soria and Sufi.</p> <p>Inside their hearts, there was a whirlwind of anticipation that Zeid might come into the place they were in and a sense of shyness that was somewhat akin to a feeling of stranger anxiety.</p> <p>However,</p>  <p>『Will Zeid-san come here? 』</p> <p>『No, he went straight back when he saw the battlefield had settled down! 』</p> <p>““Shobon*”” <em>(TN: SFX for falling)</em></p> <p><em> </em></p> <p>The two were both dejected by the fact that Zeid had left.</p>  <p>“……Let’s go”</p>  <p>The Archpriest Zai, who looked less than pleased with the situation, left the place with his soldiers.</p>  <p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p>  <p>At an abandoned church.</p> <p>The congregation seats, which should have been neatly arranged in the past, were sparsely collapsing or pulled to the edges.</p> <p>At the deepest point, the bronze statue of the goddess Astea was half-destroyed and was eerily illuminated by the moonlight.</p> <p>There’s a man under the statue who had his face hidden in the shadows, and a dozen people were on one knee and one hand on the ground in front of him.</p>  <p>&#8220;What does this mean!&#8221;</p>  <p>The man&#8217;s angry voice echoes.</p> <p>That wrath――was directed to the group of demon tribe members who were waiting upon him.</p> <p>The demons, who are supposed to be proud and capable, are turning their faces down as they are told so. It&#8217;s a sign of neither denial nor defiance.</p> <p>The man yelling at them was that special.</p>  <p>“I’d have thought two or three fronts could be defeated even if the Sword saint and Saint would move, but&#8230;&#8230; that’s all. How can I accept the story that all the frontlines were forced back!? Our goal is to fill this land with fear and anxiety!”</p> <p>“……I’m very sorry”</p>  <p>So apologized Ruilde, a Demon that had taken on two mercenary groups on the battlefield and won. He had escaped from the Sword Saint.</p> <p>However, his confident demeanor has become meek.</p>  <p>“I&#8217;m not asking for an apology, you piece of garbage!&#8221;</p> <p>“Guah!?”</p>  <p>The man&#8217;s kick hits Ruilde in the abdomen.</p> <p>Ruilde was blown away. He was sent to the corner of the church, covered in dust and holding his stomach in pain.</p>  <p>“Who was it, that Zeid man!”</p> <p>“E,even if we look him up, it was only that he was a member of the knight order of the Kingdom of Kuzehra &#8230;&#8230; Moreover, the knight order has collapsed, so to have more information &#8230;&#8230;”</p>  <p>When he was asked that, Ruilde answered suffocatingly as he straightens his posture.</p>  <p>“Such information is obviously a dummy! If he had belonged to the Knight Order, he would have been much more famous!”</p> <p>“But before he joined the guild, he really didn&#8217;t have any name or so&#8230;&#8230;”</p> <p>“No more excuses!”</p>  <p>After being denied by the man, Ruilde fell silent.</p> <p>Normally, it’s highly unlikely for a demon to be defeated by a human being in an 『individual』 fight.</p> <p>And yet, in the second and third areas, even the groups of demons have been defeated.</p> <p>By only one person, the S-rank adventurer named Zeid.</p>  <p>“Tsk, is that guy in some kind of religion?”</p> <p>“No…… he’s not involved with any of them.”</p> <p>“Then it’s good. He won’t be coming to the next Great Holy Prayer Place.”</p>  <p>Great Holy Prayer Place.</p> <p>It is a prayer hall where a colossal statue of the goddess Astea stands located in the Holy Republic. It is like a square under a blue sky and can accommodate about 50,000 people.</p> <p>It opens every year when the world is in turmoil, or something similar. The head priest ―― now called Soria ―― offers words of prayer to the goddess Astea, and the participants also offer prayers.</p> <p>This year, it is supposed to be open because of it being a turbulent year.</p> <p>Moreover, its scale is going to be larger than the previous years.</p>  <p>The half destruction of the Kingdom of Kuzehra</p> <p>Two crises that hit the Holy Republic</p> <p>Succession to the throne of the Weira Empire</p> <p>invasion of the demon tribe</p>  <p>Based on these factors, it is expected that people will gather not only from within the Holy Republic but from all over the world.</p> <p>The number of participants isn’t controlled, as it was a free-to-participate event, but it was estimated that the number would exceed 100,000 people.</p> <p>What if there is a demon in that place of prayer of the human race.</p> <p>It will also be very out of place.</p> <p>At that moment, moonlight shone on the man under the statue, revealing his appearance.</p>  <p>“We’ll do a massacre. Kill the symbol of the Astea religion, the saint Soria, and destroy the colossal statue of the goddess Astea. I don&#8217;t think there&#8217;s any problem with that plan.”</p>  <p>Zai Fonde, the Archpriest of the Astea church.</p> <p>He was a central figure in the human race who carried the Astea religion.</p>  <p>“Yes. It has no problem. One of the Seven Great Demon Aristocrats——Youssef-sama”</p>  <p>Ruilde once again waited upon firmly.</p> <p>Youssef. That was the real name of Zai Fonde, and his name as a demon.</p>  <p>“It has been a long time since the Demon King was defeated by the detestable hero. It&#8217;s been a while since we had a ceasefire with this inferior human race. Finally. Finally, the days of having this bitter experience are coming to an end. &#8230;&#8230;! It&#8217;s time for me to take the first step towards becoming the Demon King.&#8221;</p>  <p>Youssef clenches his fists and continues.</p>  <p>“Those foolish demon aristocrats who are busy fighting over the demon territory will eventually understand Youssef&#8217;s noble spirit and kneel down to recognize him as the successor to the Demon King. What we demons should do ―― is to exact revenge on the human race. Now, let the war of aggression begin!”</p> <p>Youssef spread his hands wide and said as if to declare loudly.</p> <p>Steadily, a scheme was in progress on that day.</p>

<p>Apparently, there are several grounds.</p>  <p>“I heard you disintegrated the knights you belonged to.”</p> <p>“……Ah”</p>  <p>Apparently, she has investigated me.</p>  <p>“It seems that it turns out that the Knights were doing a lot of wrongdoing behind the scenes. Did you destroy them to cover up your own sordid history?”</p> <p>“Hey, it’s different. I just received the request and protected the client.”</p> <p>“Either way, the Chivalric Order have collapsed. And the Kingdom of Kuzhera has fallen into a country that is not suitable for being called a great power.”</p> <p>“Well, I admit I could have done better.”</p> <p>“As a result, you have ungratefully destroyed the country you lived in and its institutions from the inside.

Two threats have occurred since the beginning of this year. And it seems that you are involved in both of them.”</p> <p>“One was when the Chivalric Order tried to cause a flood of monsters with the use of a magic item, and the other was the King&#8217;s Dragon matter, right? But that&#8217;s just something I got involved in.”</p> <p>“Just got involved in? What an excuse”</p>  <p>She seems to be in a bad mood, and rejects my arguments outright with a glare.</p>  <p>“If I had been there, at least I would have solved the problem better than you did. I would have been able to suppress the damage more. I would never have let the king dragon be captured, and I would have prevented the great flood of monsters.”</p> <p>“Well, since I was just doing what I was requested to do.”</p>  <p>If it were only to protect the country from threats, it might have been possible for Fir.</p> <p>Still, Fir wasn&#8217;t there, so as far as I&#8217;m concerned, she only knows what she wants to say, not that I approve of what Fir has to say.</p>  <p>&#8220;Are you still thinking of staying with that person?”</p> <div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 --> <div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div> <p>She glares at me with eyes sharper than ever before.</p> <p>Her voice wasn’t rough, but I sensed a clear hostility from them.</p>  <p>“She gives people hope.

So I have to do a lot of requests and hard sell myself to match Zeid&#8217;s pace.”</p>  <p>The beautiful red-haired woman said so.</p> <p>Fir stops unnaturally with a snap.</p> <p>Naturally, Quena and Sheila also felt her presence and turned around.</p>  <p>“Zeid’s party?”</p> 
<p>Fir muttered in a whisper.</p> <p>Quena, tilted her head when she realized that the girl had been listening to them.</p>  <p>“What is it? What’s the matter?”</p> <p>“If I’m not mistaken, you’re talking about the charisma party?”</p> <p>“Well, that’s right, but”</p>  <p>Quena answered Fir&#8217;s question.</p> <p>Quena’s goal is to actually party with Zeid and to make her sister and the others around her look back at her.</p> <p>Whether it&#8217;s the Charisma party or Zeid, it&#8217;s the same thing.</p>  <p>“Wait Quena. This person has a dangerous atmosphere around her.”</p>  <p>Sheila whispered as she tapped Quena on the shoulder.</p> <p>However, the call came a little too late.</p> <p>Fir pulls out her sword and sets it up.</p> <p>Sheila and Quena, with their superior swordsmanship and experience, reacted to Fir&#8217;s hostility and movements and reflexively drew their swords.</p>  <p>“So you&#8217;re a candidate for his party. Then let&#8217;s put your skills to the test.”</p> <p>“Ha? What are you talking about. I&#8217;m not saying I&#8217;m a candidate, I&#8217;m saying I got rejected, though”</p> <p>“No, I&#8217;d like to think I’m a candidate. I’ll have a party with Zeid, and eventually, we’ll be a party for life &#8230;&#8230;!”</p> <p>“Sheila shut your mouth―――tu!”</p>  <p>As Quena looked at Sheila with her words, which were neither blurred nor serious, with dismay, she swallowed her words with the pressurized magic power that was being released from in front of her.</p> <p>Her hand holding her sword reacted with a twitch.</p>  <p>“I’m Fir Eiji”</p> <p>“……The Sword Saint……!?”</p>  <p>Quena was familiar with the name.</p> <p>It would be rare for a human being not to know about her.</p> <p>Naturally, Sheila knows her, too, and she breaks out in a cold sweat.</p>  <p>“Let me test how good the people who are going to join Zeid&#8217;s party are. Come on, you two.”</p> <p>“Quena……! I think you understand it, but …&#8230;”</p> <p>“…… I know”</p>  <p>The two swallowed their saliva hard.</p> <p>Quena continues to speak.</p>  <p>“She’s definitely strong……―――”</p> <p>“――This person is…… a 『Rival』……!”</p> <p>“What are you talking about!?”</p> <p>“This girl is also aiming to be in Zeid&#8217;s party, too! That’s obvious!”</p> <p>“Is that so!?”</p> <p>“……Tsk. That’s incorrect. That guy!”</p>  <p>Fir, who was paralyzed by the conversation between the two, slashed at them.</p> <p>She first aims for Quena. Her heavy sword presses down on her.</p>  <p>“Kuuh……!”</p>  <p>It was so heavy that Quena puts her left hand on the blade and uses it to push back.</p> <p>With her teeth clenched, footprints were made on the ground.</p>  <p>“Eeyah!”</p>  <p>A shadow pierces Fir from Quena’s side. It&#8217;s Sheila.</p> <p>It was a merciless blow aimed at her vital spot. The speed, power, timing, and distance were more than sufficient.</p> <p>However, Fir lowered her sword and parried it lightly.</p> <p>Not only that.</p> <p>Faster than Sheila can bring her sword back, Fir tries to strike a blow with more velocity.</p> <p>But Quena&#8217;s sword prevented that. At the same time, Sheila&#8217;s sword aimed at Fir&#8217;s side of the head, cleaving sideways ―― Fir pitched forward and evaded it.</p> <p><em>――She detected it.</em></p> <p>Before she could even think about it, Quena, who was blocking Fir&#8217;s sword, was pushed back.</p>  <p>“Both speed and power &#8230;&#8230; that&#8217;s about it, huh”</p>  <p>Quena and Sheila are hit by Fir&#8217;s sword pressure, sending them flying.</p> <p>They were barely not cut thanks to Quena&#8217;s sword blade sandwiched between them.</p>  <p>“Strong……”</p>  <p>Quena muttered seriously.</p> <p>In just a few seconds, the difference in their abilities became obvious.</p> <p>Moreover, it was two-on-one.</p>  <p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/09/0371-728x1024.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1024" /></p>  <p><em>If it&#8217;s one-on-one――.</em></p> <p>Quena clutches the dirt in frustration.</p>  <p>“Ah, that’s correct.  I&#8217;m strong. You guys are weak. This strength is the absolute prerequisite for being next to Soria-sama in the first place.”</p> <p>“……So, what are you talking about?”</p> <p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t think that he’s a big deal that you guys who are so weak can talk about Zeid&#8217;s party. As I thought, I have to complain to the guild directly about the Charisma Party and all that.”</p> <p>“Hah!? Just because we&#8217;re trying to have a party with him doesn&#8217;t determine his ability &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>  <p>Fir didn’t respond to Quena&#8217;s words.</p> <p>However, she also knew that she wasn&#8217;t strong enough to challenge Fir.</p> <p>Quena and Sheila can only watch her back as she leaves.</p>  <p>“&#8230;&#8230; frustrating.”</p>  <p>Quena raises her body at Sheila&#8217;s murmur.</p> <p>She removes the dust from her clothing.</p>  <p>“I guess that means that we have to be more diligent. I know, it&#8217;s frustrating, but she&#8217;s right. If we keep this up, even if Zeid approves us, the people around us won&#8217;t.”</p> <p>“Gununu…… well, I don’t mind being the worst in the party, as long as I can be with Zeid.”</p> <p>“You’re pretty tamed.”</p>  <p>Although she was making fun of it, it was Sheila who was the first to express her frustration.</p> <p>They share their frustrations with each other.</p>  <p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p>It had been some time since Fir, who called herself the Sword Saint, had left.</p> <p>I left for the guild.</p> <p>To report the completion of the request and the change in the constitution of the demons.</p> <p>I arrive at the ground floor.</p> <p>However, I didn&#8217;t go to the reception desk. This time, it was a direct request from Riff.</p> <p>If Riff is not available, then it will be no problem to go to the reception desk, but first, I head to the Guild Master&#8217;s office. If she isn’t there, I will return to the first floor, but for the time being, let’s walk upstairs to get to her.</p>  <p>“Zeid!”</p>  <p>Suddenly, a voice called out to me.</p> <p>When I looked at the owner of the voice, I saw Sheila with a smiling face and Quena by her side.</p>  <p>“Oh, you’re back. I just came back from far away too. What a coincidence.”</p> <p>“What are you talking about. You accepted the borderline request, right. That&#8217;s why our supposed work was gone.”</p>  <p>Quena says, while putting her hands on her hips.</p> <p>It appears that we had passed each other, or were in the same vicinity.</p>  <p>“Eh, seriously? I was thinking that it was within the range that it wouldn’t have much effect on you, though&#8230;&#8230;”</p> <p>“It was simply a fierce hard-fought battle, and most of it was pretty much settled by you. There was also a concentration of demons in the area we were in. Sometimes it&#8217;s better to look at the number of things rather than the size of the area.”</p> <p>“But, it was as I expected of Zeid. We didn&#8217;t fight against the demons, but I heard that several famous mercenary groups were completely crushed by them!”</p>  <p>While Quena pointed that out, Sheila, who excitedly said so, with a dog&#8217;s tail and ears about to grow from her, was there to supplement her.</p> <p>That&#8217;s not all. She hugged me with all her might.</p> <p><em>Her soft texture stimulates my whole body through the torso&#8230;&#8230;.!</em></p>  <p>“This child, hasn&#8217;t seen Zeid in a while, so it looks like she has accumulated a lot of affection gauge.”</p> <p>“Oh really. Well, it’s mostly skin ship, though”</p>  <p>Sheila&#8217;s breasts are well above the average for women.</p> <p>It&#8217;s so stimulating that I almost feel like I&#8217;m going out of control when I&#8217;m in such close contact with her.</p>  <p>“It’s the kind of 『affection』 you’re getting. The affection I&#8217;m talking about here is the gender-specific type”</p> <p>“…..Eh, ah. I,is that so?”</p>  <p><em>Tha,that’s stupid……</em></p> <p>I know what a relationship between a man and a woman is. I had heard about it half-told by a colleague of mine in the old chivalric order of the Knights of Kuzehra. <em>It exists as knowledge.</em></p> <p>However, I never thought I&#8217;d have that kind of story so close to me. &#8230;&#8230;!</p>  <p>“Mufufu. I can hear Zeid’s heartbeat, you know?”</p>  <p>Sheila says provocatively while looking at me with an upward glance.</p> <p>However, as she says that, I can also hear Sheila&#8217;s heartbeat through her big breasts—— <em>in other words, my unrest is also being transmitted &#8230;&#8230;!</em></p> <p>Sheila, blushing from shame, is also strangely salacious, and the parts of her body that have only been used in the bathroom are now reacting.</p>  <p>“Uhhm, this is a public place, so if you three want to flirt, why don&#8217;t the three of you go to the inn?”</p>  <p>Suddenly, the receptionist, who was looking at us with reproachful eyes, called out to us.</p> <p>With a start<em>, </em>I looked around and saw the adventurers looking awkward.</p> <p>Some of them were staring at me with murderous intent.</p>  <p>“Wait a minute!? Why am I included!?”</p>  <p>Quena protested at the words of the receptionist.</p>  <p>“There you go again, you can’t hide it, you know. You were looking at Sheila-sama with envy, weren&#8217;t you?”</p> <p>“Hey, what did you say &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>  <p>My eyes meet with Quena&#8217;s, who was told by the receptionist so.</p> <p>She dyed her face bright red and looked down.</p>  <p><em>What is, this.</em></p>  <p>I was speechless at the sight of something I had never seen before.</p> <p><em>Am I, just like this&#8230;&#8230; going to die from tension and excitement? Being suffocated by happiness?</em></p> <p>Then the events of the past come to my mind like a revolving lantern ――.</p> <p>All of them were memories of fighting desperately to live――.</p> <p><em>No, it’s wrong. It was to not die.</em></p> <p>I&#8217;m living in order to redeem the negatives I&#8217;ve had so far.</p> <p><em>I can’t die.</em></p> <p>The situation now is going positive, but it&#8217;s too much of a mad dash. It causes me shortness of breath. My head is about to punctured. <em>Let&#8217;s divert the story.</em></p> <p><em>Something…… there must be something…….</em></p> <p>Suddenly, I saw dusts on Quena and Sheila.</p>  <p>“You&#8217;ve got dust on you. Did you just come back from the request?”</p> <p>“……Ugh”</p>  <p>Quena looked away, annoyed.</p> <p>But after a short indecision, she hung her head.</p>  <p>“I&#8217;m sorry. I got tangled up with some strange woman and lost.&#8221;</p> <p>“Hmm, who was it for you to lose. More importantly, why are you apologizing to me?”</p> <p>“Listen to this, Zeid. A person had heard our conversation about how we wanted to join Zeid&#8217;s party, and she thought that we were potential members of Zeid&#8217;s party, misunderstanding us”</p>  <p>Sheila is also looks apologetic and has her eyes downcast.</p> <p><em>Ah…… I see.</em></p> <p>Apparently, they took it upon themselves to carry my name. That’s why, they were thinking like they&#8217;ve damaged my name because they lost.</p>  <p>“Don&#8217;t worry about that. It was rather a disaster to be involved in such a thing. I&#8217;m just glad you guys are okay.”</p>  <p>I don’t have a name that they’ll hurt.</p> <p>I was doing requests that even F-ranks receive, and there is a part within the masses where they treat me like some kind of a disaster. &#8230;&#8230;</p> <p>My name isn’t that good.</p>  <p>“Zeid…………!”</p>  <p>Sheila, looking very moved, appears as if she is about to cry.</p>  <p>“I will definitely become a party member adequate for you &#8230;&#8230;!”</p> <p>“I, can’t lose to her either. Absolutely.”</p>  <p>There was a firm will in their eyes. <em>It wasn&#8217;t all bad, it seemed.</em></p>  <p>“Well, then I&#8217;m off to Riff&#8217;s. Good luck.”</p> <p>“Augh&#8221;</p>  <p>I walk up the stairs, peeling off Sheila, who was sticking to me like glue, who moans adorably as if she has regrets parting with me.</p> <p><em>However, there many cases of people getting involved with strange guys these days, huh?</em></p> <p>A strange woman also came to the inn I’m staying.</p> <p><em>I wonder if there are a lot of troublesome people appearing because of the various messy times we are living in.</em></p> <p><em> </em></p> <p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p>  <p>I knock on the door of the Guildmaster&#8217;s office.</p> <p>I get a voice saying, &#8220;Come in,&#8221; and I open the door.</p> <p>There was one little girl inside.</p> <p>A luxurious but small office desk and a toddler&#8217;s chair, which must have been custom-made for toddlers, were lined up inside. <em>The room is like a den of gaps.</em></p> <p>Of course, the ones she uses to greet guests are large enough to be appropriate for adults.</p> <p>I didn&#8217;t hesitate to sit in the chair for adults.</p>  <p>“You&#8217;re always here. Aren’t you busy?”</p> <p>“What is this, you are happy to see me, aren&#8217;t you? You should be more than happy, you know?”</p>  <p>Her character is as pompous as ever.</p> <p>I don’t mind it at all, since the receptionist lady will deal with me even if she’s not there.</p> <p>However, I heard that this guy is the head of the entire guild.</p> <p>The fact that she doesn&#8217;t seem to be working reminds me of my boss when I was at the Chivalric Order of the Kingdom of Kuzehra.</p>  <p>“I&#8217;m getting kind of anxious if the top isn&#8217;t moving.”</p> <p>“Pupu. Being anxious is cute. Rest assured. To begin with, we are not the kind of organization that makes a move in a flashy manner.”</p>  <p>She happily stepped away from her office desk with very cute steps and sat down in the chair opposite to mine.</p> <p>Between us is a low black table use for reception.</p>  <p>“I&#8217;ve heard about your request. I will give you the stamp of completion, so you’d better take it out.”</p>  <p>As usual, her bright golden eyes are sparkling brilliantly.</p> <p>She moves her small hand flutteringly as if making me hand over the request form.</p>  <p>“Here&#8217;s the request form.”</p> <p>“Umu. You did a fine job again. Here is your commission.”</p> <p>“I receive it. &#8230;&#8230; And I have a few things to report.”</p> <p>“What’s the matter?”</p>  <p><em>Swing*, </em>Riff tilted her head to the side.</p>  <p>“Actually, the demons whom I fought this time are strange. I felt several different kinds of magic power in their bodies, and it was weird. And they were several times stronger than the demons I had fought before.”</p> <p>“Hou? Does that mean that there has been an unusual change in the demon kinds?”</p>  <p><em>Good guess.</em></p> <p>And yet, Riff also wonders about it, putting her index finger and thumb on her chin in contemplation.</p>  <p>“Mumuh. The only thing I can think of is that they’re taking in someone else&#8217;s magic power.&#8221;</p> <p>“Someone else?”</p> <p>“Umu, I have heard that a small number of specific demons have been involved in recent conflicts. Perhaps the other demons are lending their magic power to the battle in order to reduce casualties, and the small group of elite soldiers are fighting that battle.”</p>  <p>It would be reasonable to think so.</p> <p>The answer I came up with is almost the same.</p> <p>It is easy to actually borrow the magic power of others. This can be done through magic items, or by touching each other and sending magic power directly. Even more so if it was a demon tribe with superior magic power manipulation and magic techniques.</p> <p>This will also allow them to handle magic of higher difficulty levels by making up for the lack of magic power.</p> <p>It&#8217;s also rational to move in small numbers.</p> <p>If one of them has the power of a mercenary corps alone, they can fight like a guerrilla in a conflict zone.</p> <p>However, I have some doubts with that.</p>  <p>“It&#8217;s a question of whether or not a high pride demon tribe would give up their magic power to another.&#8221;</p> <p>“Indeed. To give away your magic power is to admit that one is more suited in battle than you are. Not a few of them will come to that conclusion and will refuse the transfer.”</p>  <p>Riff is also holding her head.</p> <p>If it was their family members, then they might lend their magic power to help those who would go into battle, but&#8230;&#8230;</p> <p><em>Then I&#8217;ll go too! </em>That is the thinking of the demon tribe.</p> <p>It would be more efficient to attack a weakened kingdom head-on and in numbers than to use guerrilla tactics in a battle to redraw the border lines in the first place.</p> <p>I still can&#8217;t arrive at what I think is the right answer.</p>  <p>“Or rather, if you have any doubts, why don&#8217;t you just catch them and do a cross-examination?”</p> <p>“No, I interrogated them. They wouldn’t tell it to me, even if they died.”</p>  <p>Some even took their own lives in bizarre fears.</p> <p>It would have been lucky to find someone whom I could ask and they answered, though.</p>  <p>“Fumuh…… what a scary story. I didn&#8217;t want to hear such a story, especially right before the opening of the Great Holy Prayer Place.”</p>  <p>Great Holy Prayer Place.</p> <p>I&#8217;ve been hearing that word a lot lately.</p> <p>It’s a place to pray to the goddess Astea, for the Astea religion.</p> <p>Many people from different countries come just to pray in it, and it seems that this year, their number is expected to be especially high.</p>  <p>“Well, it&#8217;s true that we should be careful.”</p> <p>“Yes, that&#8217;s right. If the demons have acquired more advanced magic techniques and fighting methods than the past, we must be vigilant. &#8230;&#8230; Oh, yes. Speaking of which, are you planning to go to the Great Holy Prayer Place?”</p>  <p>Riff asked, as if to continue where we left off.</p> <p>I shake my head from side to side.</p>  <p>“That&#8217;s impossible. It is no exaggeration to say that I brought about the half destruction of the kingdom of Kuzehra.”</p> <p>“Well, certainly, you were part of the reason why so many people will gather at the prayer place&#8230;&#8230;”</p>  <p>Even if I go like this, they’ll only just look at me and say 『Why did this guy bring his face here? 』.</p> <p>The same was true for the woman who called herself the Sword Saint named Fir.</p> <p>She had a section where she thought I was the one responsible for the damage in the crisis at the Holy Republic.</p> <p>There will be plenty of other people who want a target to direct their resentment at besides her.</p>  <p>“But as a member of the Charisma party, I think you need to show some pious attitude for the goddess Astea. The idea is that it&#8217;s a sincere party that is close to the people.”</p> <p>“They want someone who&#8217;s religious?”</p> <p>“Umu, that’s correct. Believers are more easily trusted than atheists. Especially from the perspective of a fellow believer.”</p> <p>“Is that so…… Well, but it’s at least not now. If I show up and get any unnecessary jealousy, it will only hurt the guild&#8217;s sign.”</p> <p>“You don&#8217;t have to care about anyone’s opinions. However, it does mean that you also care about the guild. Kakaka”</p>  <p>Riff laughs happily.</p> <p>I&#8217;m always thinking about the guild, though.</p> <p>Since they picked me up, it shouldn&#8217;t be surprising that I would want to return the favor.</p> <p>I also have to thank the guys who gave me their recommendations. <em>With how things got this way, I myself don’t know what happened at all, though.</em></p>  <p>“&#8230;&#8230; Well, I guess it&#8217;s a good opportunity to learn about the Astea religion while I’m at it.”</p>  <p>I, muttered silently.</p> <p>Of course, I can&#8217;t go to the Great Holy Prayer Place as it is.</p>

<p><strong><a style= "text-decoration:none;" href="">Chapter 4 &#8211; A Reminiscent Talk</a></strong></p>

<p>It’s a story about a girl.</p> <p>It is said that it normally takes more than a year for a person to acquire one magic.</p> <p>Before that, it is necessary to spend ten years to understand the flow of magic power and convert it into magic, which is the basic understanding for using magic.</p> <p>It’s at least ten and a year——that&#8217;s the reason.</p> <p>However, on rare occasions, someone comes along who is called a genius.</p> <p>Some can handle magic at the age of five.</p> <p>Some people can master one magic spell in a month.</p> <p>However, the girl was able to handle healing magic even before she had awareness.</p> <p>Compared to the 『Saints』 of the past, it was an anathema.</p> <p>The parents of such a girl were priests of the Astea religion.</p> <p>They never wanted to misuse the girl&#8217;s power, and in fact, they even gave alms to those who could not afford to pay for the healing.</p> <p>Naturally, a good reputation has flowed into them.</p> <div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 --> <div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div> <p>The people praised her parents for being good.</p> <p>They extoled the girl as a saint.</p> <p>――But, one day though.</p> <p>A carriage carrying the young girl and her parents was attacked in a deserted forest.</p> <p>Their strong escort knights were easily defeated.</p> <p>It was near the border between the Holy Republic and the kingdom.</p> <p>The assailants were ―― demons(mazoku).</p> <p>Somehow, the several demons, far more powerful than usual, easily took the lives of her parents.</p> <p>Right in front of her eyes, her parents, who gave birth and raised her, were torn apart and killed.</p> <p>The demons then said.</p>  <p>“Now we can have our way.&#8221;</p> <p>“Yeah, we&#8217;ll be more strengthened.

But the Holy Sword did not respond to anyone standing on the field of the Colosseum.</p> <p>Sufi was dejected. After all that, she thought, it was impossible to find them out of the blue.</p> <p>At that time, a disaster occurred.</p> <p>A horde of dragons had attacked the divine city.</p> <p>And yet, or perhaps because of this, the 『Holy Sword』 reacted.</p> <p>It was not anyone who was standing on the field.</p> <p>It was responding to one man in the audience seats who was watching with leisure.</p>  <p>『……Savior-sama……!』</p>
<p>For a girl who had fought so hard in the dark, desperately up until now, the man was a ray of light.</p> <p>It was a hope that would shatter the unbearable despair.</p> <p>That&#8217;s why she tried to call out to him on the spot —— but she stopped.</p> <p><em>What if he is targeted by the Astea religion?</em></p> <p><em>I heard that he is an S-ranked person in the guild.</em></p> <p><em>It&#8217;s not that he was not well-known by any means.</em></p> <p><em>What if he cooperated with the true Astea religion, which is full of unfavorable criticisms?</em></p> <p><em>Now is not the time.</em></p> <p>Sufi thought so.</p> <p>But one day, surely, when the time comes.</p> <p>Sufi intends to hand over the holy sword to him.</p>

<p><strong><a style= "text-decoration:none;" href="">Chapter 5 &#8211; Battle</a></strong></p>

<p>I was at the Great Holy Prayer Place.<br /> Located within the Holy Republic, this place is, in a word, vast.<br /> It was a place where a three-meter round wall encloses a land that has nothing but a giant statue. There are four gates in all directions, and people are pouring in.<br /> A colossal statue of the goddess Astea towers in the center, with a high pedestal at her feet. There are also the Knights of the Holy Republic and Soria surrounding it.<br /> But there was nothing else. That&#8217;s all there is.<br /> The square was already filled with more than 50,000 people, even though that should have been the only object in the place.<br /> Furthermore, the outside of the walls is filled with people waiting to enter.<br /> But strangely enough, it doesn&#8217;t feel cramped.<br /> The colossal statue will probably rust if it gets rained on, but it is shining beautifully, whether it was being constantly maintained or not.<br /> What a mysterious place.</p> <p>“Oh, it’s been a while, isn’t it”</p> <p>Like so, I was called out.<br /> I turned around and saw a somewhat familiar face.</p> <p>“Err”<br /> “What the, have you forgotten? Didn&#8217;t you receive the flyer from the true Astea-Religion’s solicitation?”<br /> “Ah. At that time”</p> <p>The man was the one who handed out flyers to me when I was in the Royal Capital watching the solicitation activities of the True Astea religion some time ago.<br /> But I wonder how they could remember me.<br /> Is it because of the mask I bought to hide my true identity and watch the activities of the True Astea-religion?<br /> Riff had told me that I didn&#8217;t have to conceal myself to visit, but I wore it just in case.<br /> It&#8217;s hard to make a sound with it when hit, and although it&#8217;s a little difficult to use, it was handy.<br /> It&#8217;s heartbreaking to be looked at suspiciously from time to time, but it can&#8217;t be helped.</p> <p>“Which religion are you from? You didn&#8217;t come to us after all.”<br /> “Nowhere, today I’m just going to sightsee”<br /> “Sightsee, huh……. It&#8217;s a bit of a bad time, isn&#8217;t it? Maybe you should come back again?”</p> <p>The man says with a bitter look on his face.<br /> Is it about the crowds of people?</p> <p>&#8220;It&#8217;s just too much trouble to come back now. Or rather, do believers other than Astea come here? The way you spoke earlier, it sounded like there were others besides the Astea Religion. In addition, you guys are also here”<br /> “Of course there are some. There are various religions that worship Astea-sama. It’s not only us, the True Astea-Religion.”</p> <p>Come to think of it, there was no word or action that persecutes the true Astea-religion which I felt in the royal capital.<br /> Rather, they fit in naturally.<br /> Looking closely, I can also see Sufi.<br /> There were others who appeared to be priests of various religions as well.</p> <p>“However, it is the Astea religion who would be in-charge isn’t it? Is it okay?”<br /> “Normally, this wouldn&#8217;t happen, okay? But this place this year has an exception. It&#8217;s time to unite because of various crises. In addition――&#8221;</p> <p>The man looks up.<br /> He was looking not at the blue sky, but at the colossal statue of Astea.</p> <p>“―― it’s because we all share the same faith in Astea-sama.”<br /> “I see”</p> <div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 --> <div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div> <p>As I look, everyone here is looking up.<br /> Unity.<br /> From my point of view, it is as if Astea Religion is taking the lead, but I wonder if such power struggles are of little interest to those who believe in something.<br /> Or, do they think that as long as magic power is sent to Astea, it doesn&#8217;t matter whom they are praying to, from anywhere―― (TN: I think he’s getting it)</p> <p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p> <p>Around the time each person was just barely spaced out, entry to the inside of the wall became restricted.<br /> There is at least room to sit down. I guess they leave it like that in case someone feels sick.<br /> I wonder how many tens of thousands of people are tightly controlled by the Astea religion standing on top of the wall. It’s quite amazing.<br /> And they all have considerable magical powers. ——The knight guarding the square dressed as a religious official, perhaps.<br /> Thinking that far, I shook my head.<br /> We are inside the Holy Republic. As expected, this is not true. ……it should be.<br /> In addition, I simply can feel the magic power of every person on them. It can&#8217;t be, it shouldn&#8217;t be.</p> <p>『Everyone, thank you very much for joining us』</p> <p>Suddenly, a man&#8217;s voice rang out.<br /> There is a magic item, a loudspeaker, on a pedestal under the foot of the colossal statue. A man clad in priestly garb is speaking there.<br /> No, he is dressed a little more flamboyantly than a priest. He is a blue-haired man, but he has a strength more suited to battle than to priesthood.</p> <p>『Even in the current unstable situation, with the blessing of the goddess Astea――』</p> <p>And so on.<br /> He talks about the past, present, and future in tandem with Astea.<br /> And some were moved to tears by that.<br /> There are quite a few people here who seemed to have had a tough experience.<br /> However, the people surrounding Sufi, including the man next to me, who may be a true Astea believer, look more bitter than sad.<br /> They look as if they are waiting for something.</p> <p>『Then let us end our talk shortly and not make this any longer. Let us move on to the time of prayer. 』</p> <p>A man who looked like a priest said so. Then, cheers were heard from inside and outside the square.<br /> Moreover, some are even shouting “Uoooh!”. I wonder what are they so happy about.<br /> Is this some sort of ritual for praying out loud? Perhaps some in the audience who felt the priest&#8217;s talk was too long were excited that it was finally over. (TN: This line made me laugh)<br /> I find out the reason why when I was thinking that――<br /> It was Soria who ascended to the pedestal. When she showed her face from above, the plaza became more excited.</p> <p>『While it may be presumptuous, I, Soria Aiden, will perform the prayer ritual. 』</p> <p>Soria bows lightly as she says so.<br /> The audience got so excited that the ground shook at the sight of her.<br /> This is no longer the religion of the goddess Astea, but of the saint Soria. It&#8217;s lively enough to make you think so.</p> <p>『The idol of this place, will be this huge bronze statue. 』</p> <p>Soria explains by pointing her hand at the colossal statue behind her.<br /> An idol. It is the object of prayer.<br /> They range from pendants and fist-sized objects to those that make their presence felt prominently like in this plaza. They exist in a wide variety of forms.<br /> Magic power will be delivered to the goddess through them.<br /> Was something I researched before coming here. I had to get some prior knowledge because I can&#8217;t learn enough just by coming to the site.</p> <p>『Then let us pray.』</p> <p>After putting her hands on top of each other, Soria begins to close her eyes and pray.<br /> The people prayed with their hands in unison. Magic power flowed into the statue and was stored.<br /> ――That’s what it looked like, but my eyes saw a strange flow of magical power.<br /> The magic power is heading to another place via the statue. It flows to the man who stood on the pedestal before Soria&#8217;s speech, and to the followers of the Astea religion on the wall.<br /> Gradually, the magic power of the various people who dedicated their prayer accumulates in their bodies.<br /> An individual who possesses several different kinds of magic powers was familiar to me.<br /> ―― It was the demons I saw on the battlefield.<br /> However, what surprised me most of all was ――</p> <p>“That&#8217;s enough! High Priest of the Church of Astea ―― Zai Fonde!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 --> <div data-fuse="22386378219"></div> </div> <p>It was Sufi, the girl who started screaming as if she had expected it.<br /> The flow of magic power I was seeing had a red color. It was the 『color that shows the flow of magic power』 that made it possible for anyone to see the magic power that was invisible to ordinary people who had no experience in combat.<br /> The prayer was forcibly interrupted by the shouts of Sufi.</p> <p>“This red color is magic power, everyone! It is the magic power of everyone which should have reached Goddess Astea! It has been absorbed by the archpriest Zai Fonde and some of the Astea members!”</p> <p>The girl&#8217;s words caused a stir around her.</p> <p>“There must have been a lot of rumors already! A few people have already heard about the scandals of the Astea Religion! The demon tribe has taken over the Astea religion ――”<br /> “――Kuhaha. That&#8217;s enough.”</p> <p>Subjected to Sufi&#8217;s words, Zai Fonde stood on a pedestal. He’s next to Soria.<br /> A very evil-looking smile stretched across his face.</p> <p>“It’s already good”</p> <p>Zai snaps his fingers.<br /> At the same time, the red magic power returns to the colossal statue of the goddess. In that moment ―― an explosion occurred. The huge mass of iron exploded as it swelled up from within.<br /> It was an ear-splitting sound.<br /> That&#8217;s not all. The lump of iron burst with great force.<br /> Naturally, it is accompanied by a high killing power, which falls on the people in this plaza.<br /> But, on the verge of that.</p> <p>&#8220;Please activate it!&#8221;</p> <p>Sufi yells again.<br /> At the same time, several magic circles were deployed. The young girl and her followers seemed to have made some preparation for this.<br /> Defensive magic circles were deployed around Sufi, throughout the square, and even outside the square to protect the people from the rain of iron lumps.<br /> It&#8217;s not an improvised, fragile magic circle, but a well-crafted one.</p> <p>“Heh. Well done”</p> <p>As Zai praises her, his body distorts and changes.<br /> No, I guess it would be more correct to say that he is returning to his original form rather than changing.<br /> His hair was gone, and his looks became that of a demon tribe, with blue skin, reddish-black eyes, and sharp fangs. Black wings had grown from his back as if to reveal his true identity.</p> <p>“Demon……! As I thought, the Astea religion is being manipulated by the demons &#8230;&#8230;! &#8230;&#8230; Everyone, please run away! The true Astea religion will take care of this place!”</p> <p>Sufi said so, but no one was able to react to that.<br /> Suddenly, everyone was petrified, unsure of what was happening.<br /> In the midst of all this――</p> <p>“Zai Fonde!! Stay away from Soria-sama!”<br /> “【Sword Saint】 Fir! Hahaha! You&#8217;re fast indeed!”</p> <p>This was the woman I got tangled with at the inn some time ago.<br /> Her silver-white sword strikes at Zai. She tries to pull him away from Soria.<br /> But Zai parried Fir&#8217;s sword, which looked sharp, with his bare hands.<br /> The dull sound of steel clashing with each other rings out.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 --> <div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div> <p>“――I would have been done in if it was me a long time ago”</p> <p>Zai&#8217;s murmur, which sounded like he has plenty of room, was picked up by the loudspeaker magic item.<br /> At the same time.<br /> Fir is knocked down to the ground far below by Zai&#8217;s feet. Part of the pedestal collapses due to that.<br /> Soria&#8217;s screams were also heard over the loudspeaker.</p> <p>“Listen, human race! The more you prayed, the more power we demons would possess. Goddess Astea? Fuhahaha! Such a being is an illusion! Praying is futile! You inferior and worthless humans will now be personally slaughtered by the Seventh Demon Aristocrat and next Demon King, Youssef-sama!!”</p> <p>That seems to be the signal.<br /> The followers of the Astea Religion standing on top of the wall had also returned to their original demonic forms and were looking down on the square, smiling nihilistically.<br /> The entire square was in an uproar.<br /> In the sudden abnormal situation, there are even people who mutter 『Is this some kind of an event or &#8230;&#8230;? 』.<br /> But the man next to me, a member of the True Astea-religion, looked distressed and deployed a defensive magic circle even though his magic power was about to run out. Both of his hands were holding magic items.<br /> If he puts his magic power into the magic items they distributed in advance, the defensive magic circle would be activated.</p> <p>“Let me say it again! Please run away! We, the True Astea religion, will stop them!”</p> <p>Sufi&#8217;s words set off a chain reaction, this time by one person and then another.<br /> The next thing I know, there is an altercation over the four gates. The shouts of &#8220;go, go, quickly&#8221; bellowed through the air.<br /> The demons, looking at such figures as if they were humorous, turn its hand to the defensive magic circle constructed by the followers of the True Astea religion.<br /> The demons on the wall unleashed their attack magic.<br /> Water, fire, wind, lightning, earth, spear, sword, axe, arrow. &#8230;&#8230;<br /> It was an enormous storm of attacks. Gradually, cracks appear in the magic circle.</p> <p>(As expected, it will be bad if I don’t lend a hand here huh)</p> <p>The guild’s name will get tarnished.<br /> Not to mention, there is talk about the charisma party. I can&#8217;t afford to put Soria, who will become one of my companions, in danger.<br /> As almost everyone around me has disappeared as well, I put so much force into my legs without hesitation that the ground cracks.</p> <p>“O,oi. While we&#8217;re dealing with it, you should run away too &#8230;&#8230;!”<br /> &#8220;Please be patient for a while&#8221;<br /> “Wha!?”</p> <p>Rather than using transfer magic, it is sometimes surprisingly better to charge with all my strength with my legs if I can see them.<br /> Especially this time, there is only one enemy around Soria ―― it’s Zai Fonde…… no, was it Youssef?<br /> Anyway, it’s only that demon.<br /> If so, I’ll pull them apart. All I need is power and speed.<br /> If I used transfer, I could get close to him in an instant, but I don&#8217;t have the momentum. Even if it was me, Youssef, who has been strengthened by capturing the magic power of others, I can&#8217;t see his limit. That’s why, that’s why.<br /> The ground rumbles with a squeak.<br /> The scenery changes in an instant.<br /> Youssef was already in front of me.</p> <p>“What the, you are ―――”</p> <p>This was why.<br /> Youssef is drowned in power and is letting his guard down. And I believed that he would take my attack. Like with Fir’s sword.<br /> And my prediction was right on the mark.<br /> Youssef was blown away towards the colossal statue. The colossal statue, which has its shape below the torso remained even after the explosion, has completely collapsed this time.</p> <p>“Fuh…… Soria, are you okay?”<br /> “Eh, yes…… eh? I me-me-me-mean, that voice……!”</p> <p>As Soria is about to say this, I hear the sound of debris being pushed away from two locations.<br /> One is under the pedestal. It was Fir.<br /> She was kicked off her feet, but it seemed that she was finally back.<br /> And the other is Youssef.<br /> He stood up while brushing off the copper scraps.</p> <p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 --> <div data-fuse="22386378225"></div> </div> <p>It was at the same time Fir and Youssef got up.<br /> One by one, the defensive magic circle of the True Astea religion was broken ――― Inside, the knights, called the elite of the Holy Republic, begun to move.<br /> The knights who were patrolling outside, or looking inside, or guiding evacuation moved in unison.<br /> The walls crumble between the demons and the knights as they attack and defend from each other.<br /> Naturally, many people are caught up in it.</p> <p>“Where are you looking?”</p> <p>Youssef closes the distance in one fell swoop.<br /> Fists harder than lead, reinforced by magic power, flew at me.<br /> I avoid it just barely enough that it grazes my head.</p> <p>“I ask you again, who are you?”</p> <p>I heard a crack in the white mask. When I touched it, it seemed to be cracked from the eye to about the chin.<br /> I didn’t avoid it completely, huh.</p> <p>“Geez. This is, bad”</p> <p>I didn’t answer Youssef&#8217;s question, and cold sweat broke out on my cheeks.<br /> It&#8217;s the first sign of death I&#8217;ve felt in a long time.<br /> The magic power in Youssef&#8217;s body was gathered from nearly 100,000 followers. Even though he shared it with the other demons, it is still too huge.<br /> The amount of magic power overflowing from him was so great that it became a haze that covered Youssef&#8217;s figure.</p> <p>“Answer me!!”<br /> “Your opponent will be me! Don&#8217;t ignore me!”</p> <p>Youssef is forced to deal with the silver sword that was thrust out from his side as he tries to strike again.<br /> It’s Fir.<br /> She got up and leaped to the top of the pedestal.<br /> But it&#8217;s the same thing as before.<br /> In addition, it was received by his physical arm.<br /> Wind pressure is created by the collision of the two.<br /> Thanks to that, the cracked mask had come off. The diagonal crack ran from the bottom to the top and it fell in half.</p> <p>“As I thought! It’s Zeid-san!”</p> <p>Soria is the first to react.<br /> So, Fir and Youssef looked at me too.</p> <p>“Zeid……!? Well it’s fine, you should take Soria-sama far away from here!”<br /> “Fuhahaha! It was a miscalculation that Zeid would come, but &#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t mind. However, don&#8217;t the two of you have to group together to fight me?”</p> <p>Youssef sneers at Fir&#8217;s words.<br /> It&#8217;s just that there is too much of a difference in ability.</p> <p>“……This guy&#8217;s power won&#8217;t help me at all! I&#8217;m good enough!”</p> <p>So Fir said. What a terrible rant.<br /> Next to me, Soria has a stuffy face.</p> <p>“Fir! I&#8217;ve been thinking about you for a while now, but you&#8217;ve been underestimating Zeid-san ――!”<br /> “Well, it’s fine. I agree with you about getting Soria off the pedestal. Me and Soria are going down as it is.”</p> <p>I hug Soria sideways while saying so.<br /> It’s too late to take the stairs to go down.</p> <p>“Ho,howa……! Ze,Zeid-san……!”<br /> “I’ll leap. Clench your teeth so you don&#8217;t bite your tongue.”<br /> “Hiya, hiya &#8230;&#8230;!”</p> <p>Soria&#8217;s peach-colored lips curl into a horizontal line.<br /> After confirming that her preparation is complete, I jump off the pedestal.<br /> I was able to land on the ground without difficulty.</p> <p>“We,weren’t I heavy……!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 --> <div data-fuse="22386378225"></div> </div> <p>Soria first looked me in the face when she went down.<br /> She anxiously looks up at me and asks.</p> <p>“Not at all. You were rather light.&#8221;<br /> “O,oh really!”</p> <p>She nodded with a somewhat satisfied face.<br /> However, Soria quickly huffed and looked around.<br /> Many are injured. ……Some are dead.<br /> She looked pained at the sight of it.</p> <p>“I will heal the wounded.”<br /> “Oh, I understand”</p> <p>Her dignified behavior, undaunted by this disastrous scene, and her compassionate gaze towards the wounded, showed that she is a person of character worthy of being called a saint.<br /> As I was impressed by her, Soria who ran away, looked back at me.</p> <p>“Ah…… Uhmm, Zeid-san! Thank you for saving me from a dangerous situation again. I, will do my best to be as good as you!”<br /> “……? Ah, good luck”<br /> “Yes! Well then!”</p> <p>Soria headed for the injured this time.<br /> Did I ever help Soria before? Is she referring to the one about the Kingdom’s chivalric order?<br /> Well, whatever.<br /> Now then, Fir said she would handle Yousseff, so I’ll just deal with the other demons.</p> <p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p> <p>A battle with the Demon tribe occurred in the Great Holy Prayer Place.<br /> There were thirty of them who had been mixed in with the followers of the Astea Religion. And the demons, newly guided from the outside, also appeared one after another. There were those who transferred inside in groups or walked directly to the site.<br /> They had been accumulating magic power for this day.<br /> Their numbers had reached a hundred.<br /> In contrast, there are about 1,000 knights of the human race.<br /> Most of them are knights who carry people who have collapsed during the prayer, or serve as arbitrators in case of disputes, or are in charge of organizing the plaza.<br /> They are all so-called low-ranking or newbie soldier class.<br /> For some of them, this is their first time working with a sword in their hands.<br /> In terms of numbers, the winning knight side gradually begins to be pushed back.<br /> They cannot compete with the demons who have raised their strength with the magic power of others.<br /> The Great Holy Prayer Place was about to become a scene of a horrific slaughter—— it was supposed to.</p> <p>“Yo,you are……!”</p> <p>Ruilde, who was one of the most powerful among the hundred demons, looked astonished.<br /> ——Zeid.<br /> He was already a human which needed to be alarmed with among the demons under Youssef.<br /> He is a heretic who cannot be defeated even by a demon that has taken in multiple magic powers.<br /> He appeared on the wall where Ruilde stood. It was not long before Ruilde recognized him as such.</p> <p>“Heave-ho”<br /> “Nuooooooooooo!!”</p> <p>Zeid grabbed Ruilde&#8217;s face and slammed it under his feet, yelling as if he was cleaning the room with him.<br /> Then the walls crumble like tofu<br /> Unable to utter anything other than a scream, Ruilde was thrust directly into the ground. Then he never got up.</p> <p>“Now then, what happened to the main?”</p> <p>Zeid looked sideways at the battle between Youssef and Fir, leaving the enemies (demons) and allies (knights and followers) speechless around him.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 --> <div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div> <p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p> <p>Fir and Youssef descended from the tattered pedestals to engage in an inhuman battle in the center of the square.<br /> Ordinary people cannot follow their movement with their eyes, and it just looks like blue and brown objects are moving back and forth.<br /> Among them, only Zeid could recognize them.<br /> What will happen to the battle between the two that will determine the course of this situation, so he thought.<br /> Fir is clearly being pushed in terms of speed, power, and all other aspects of their fight.<br /> Above all, there is an overwhelming difference in their magic power.<br /> Good quality magic power can greatly strengthen one’s body and nerves. And, of course, they can use advanced magic with it.<br /> Magic can easily overturn a battle situation with a single shot.<br /> And that&#8217;s even in a one-on-one situation like this.<br /> If a sword is raised from the ground below, one will produce a step hesitation. (TN: a proverb I guess)<br /> If a light is emitted for even a moment, it can take away one’s vision.<br /> Even with that said.</p> <p>“Why!”</p> <p>Gritting, Fir clenches her teeth.<br /> It was from frustration.</p> <p>“What do you mean by why?”</p> <p>Youssef taunts and ridicules her.<br /> He was trying to get Fir to say what she intends to say.</p> <p>“Why…..don’t you use your magic!”<br /> “Ah, that’s what you meant”<br /> “Feigning ignorance……!”</p> <p>Youssef did not use any magic in his fight with Fir.<br /> He was clearly taking it easy with Fir.</p> <p>“Because it’s a waste, isn’t it? I have still more battles to fight.”<br /> “Battle, you say……?”<br /> “Ah. For that guy named Zeid over there, and for the rescue team that will be coming here. We have magic items that incorporate transfer magic for escape, but we must conserve some magic power to activate them. And we have to slaughter those who would run away. Though it is more efficient to kill them all at once with magic.”<br /> “You bastard……!”</p> <p>There were several reasons why Fir got angry.<br /> The assumption that she will get defeated herself, that he is already conscious of his fight against Zeid and not to herself, and that he will carry out further massacres in the future.</p> <p>“You have been saying and doing suspicious things for a long time! It is also important to note that even before you rose to prominence in the Astea religion, prominent priests have died with suspicious deaths: &#8230;&#8230;! And Soria-sama’s parents…… have been attacked as well!”</p> <p>Youssef&#8217;s cheeks lifted up in a disgusted manner at Fir&#8217;s each and every word.<br /> As if he was listening to an interesting story.<br /> Fir was enraged by that cocky attitude.</p> <p>“I knew you were the root of all evil!!”<br /> “I don&#8217;t need you to tell me. Yeah, it was me. It was a very vulnerable organization. They were simply a bunch of stupid people who were just trying to get a hold of a goddess or something, you know. It was easier to cut them down from the inside.”<br /> “―― one more year…… no, even a few months and I would have knocked you off your position!”</p> <p>Fir swings his sword at Youssef.<br /> The wind breaks, and a sound follows.<br /> However, Youssef grabbed it without a second thought and accepted it.</p> <p>“That&#8217;s what&#8217;s wrong with the Holy Republic. They are so desperate to maintain their neutrality with the Astea religion behind them that their response takes delayed. In the first place, since they are neutral, they are careless enough not to put the main force in the Sacred city to protect Soria.”<br /> “Such a thing――tu!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 --> <div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div> <p>Fir puts all her strength into trying to pull the sword out of her grasp.<br /> But it doesn’t work.<br /> Realizing that it was impossible, she decided to abandon her sword instantly.<br /> Instead, she pokes Youssef in the abdomen with a fist covered in thunderbolts.<br /> It has a power that would normally shatter steel.<br /> A bachi-bachi* sound is heard, and the ground is also shaken by the impact. (TN: Sound of lightning in Japanese)<br /> Youssef, however, has no scratch on him.</p> <p>“Is this what you&#8217;re capable of? &#8230;&#8230; it makes me laugh a lot. As Soria&#8217;s escort, you only earned the exaggerated title of 『Sword Saint』 because you wanted a connection to her 『Saint』 status.”<br /> “Wha……tuh”</p> <p>Fir tried to argue with something, but Youssef’s kick hit her in her temple.<br /> It was a blow that is too heavy.<br /> There was nothing to block her in the open area, and she was blown to the wall.</p> <p>“……Kaha……!”</p> <p>The shock is so great that all the air leaves her body. All of her five senses are filled with an unpleasant smell that seems to be tinged with iron. Her blood boils and her head feels like it&#8217;s about to explode.<br /> What Fir saw in her hazy vision was Youssef throwing her white silver sword ――― and a man peering into her face.</p> <p>“Are you dead? Ah, you’re alive, huh. You’re tough”<br /> “Ze……id……”</p> <p>Fir managed to utter the man&#8217;s name under her faltering breath.</p> <p>“What am I gonna do? Should I just still watch? The demons I took on were going to have a time off at death’s door, though.”</p> <p>Saying that, Zeid diverts his gaze to the surroundings.<br /> Caught in that action of his, Fir looked around and saw that the walls were crumbling in all parts and demons were lying everywhere.<br /> Naturally, some people got involved.<br /> However, the true Astea believers, Sufi, and Soria are engaged in their rescue operations.<br /> Zeid&#8217;s intervention had resulted in minimal casualties.<br /> Seeing that, Fir&#8217;s face is dyed with astonishment.<br /> But she quickly regained her composure and shook her face from side to side.</p> <p>“You…… don’t touch me!”</p> <p>Fir&#8217;s voice is full of vigor.<br /> That was already a mean thing to say.<br /> However, she was already battered and has no fragment of spirit.</p> <p>『Fir-sama was down! Zai-sama &#8230;&#8230; No, seize the traitor Zai Fonde! 』</p> <p>The troops vacated by the demons that Zeid defeated are directed to Youssef.<br /> Now that they have little time, Zeid asks Fir.</p> <p>“Why are you being so harsh to me? Do you like Soria so much that your eyes are being clouded?”<br /> “……Tsu. Still, I&#8217;m going to repay my debt to Soria-sama &#8230;&#8230;!”<br /> “Debt?”<br /> “&#8230;&#8230;When I was a child, the village where I was born and raised was burned to the ground. But I was saved by Soria-sama. I have been by her side ever since. While gaining strength to keep that person&#8217;s light alive&#8230;&#8230;.! And yet you’d gotten by Soria-sama’s side suddenly……!”</p> <p>Zeid&#8217;s mouth drops into a single line when he is told such background in a simple manner.</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div> <p>“You’re jealous, aren’t you? You want to be by her side forever, right. But that won&#8217;t mean anything if you die.”<br /> “I&#8217;ve heard about you &#8230;&#8230; all the time from Soria-sama’s stories.”<br /> “About me?”</p> <p>Surprised by that, Zeid&#8217;s eyes widened a little.<br /> Fir catches a glimpse of Soria, who is still working on the rescue operation.</p> <p>“……You are the light. That&#8217;s why, Soria-sama recommended Zeid for a place in the sun.”</p> <p>Fir grits her teeth in frustration.<br /> She seems to acknowledge that the source of Soria&#8217;s light is not with her, but with Zeid. Her inner frustration seemed to be directed at her unworthy self.</p> <p>“So that’s why the guild pulled me out”<br /> “Really, you would have been welcomed into the Knights of the Holy Republic. But that I refused.”</p> <p>Fir glared at Zeid.<br /> Zeid smiled bitterly at her jealousy because she likes Soria so much.</p> <p>“You hate it that much, huh. Me.”<br /> “I was, the only one, though. There were others from the guild who recommended you besides Soria-sama. That&#8217;s why you went to the guild, and that&#8217;s why you became S-rank without having your abilities disrespected.”<br /> “You thought I had earned my position by selling myself to them, didn&#8217;t you?”<br /> “That&#8217;s what I thought. But I guess from your ability to wipe out demons in such a short time, it must be real.”</p> <p>Fir staggers to stand up. She picks up a sword that was close to her at random.<br /> But she did not point that sword at Youssef.</p> <p>“I can’t compete with Zai Fonde. That is…… I have no choice but to admit. I admit.”</p> <p>Fir&#8217;s grip on the hilt was so tight that the sword&#8217;s blade trembled.<br /> It is humiliating and frustrating from her point of view.<br /> Still, she admitted.<br /> That Zeid can fight better.</p> <p>“Oh, good work”</p> <p>Zeid uttered only those words lightly, without making a mockery of her state.<br /> She struggled with her mental and physical hardship. Even if it meant nothing for her.<br /> Suddenly, Fir opened her mouth as if to mumble.</p> <p>“……………………so…………rry”</p> <p>Fir says in a quiet voice.<br /> Her face is tinted red.</p> <p>“Hmm? Did you say something”<br /> “I, I said I’m sorry! I know you can’t forgive my terrible rudeness and abusive language. But still…… it was my bad. In addition, I got those guys who look like your companions into it.”<br /> “Ah. That was, you huh”</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div> <p>Zeid recalled the condition of Quena and Sheila.<br /> To begin with, there will be only a limited number of people who are good enough to defeat those two, so they will be connected together arbitrarily.</p> <p>“I needed to measure your strength…… that’s what I thought”<br /> “To measure my strength, you. You’re really reckless.”<br /> &#8220;I&#8217;m really sorry &#8230;&#8230;”</p> <p>Fir uttered her apologies as her long slitted eyes droop. She had a look of sincere apology on her face.<br /> Zeid scratches his head as if he is having a hard time responding to that.</p> <p>“I don’t particularly care. Don’t mind it. Save it for when you see the two of them. No more apologies.”<br /> “……It’s vexing. When you show me the difference between our caliber to that extent.”<br /> “It feels disgusting to be lifted up by you all of a sudden”<br /> “Do,don’t say disgusting! …… But I always make a formal apology. I don&#8217;t intend to be forgiven for this.”<br /> “How can you make a statement from above so much? Really, knights do get hung up in strange places.”</p> <p>Zeid said so, while recalling the appearance of Sheila.<br /> It was the girl who is still trying to give something back, even though he has already received the commission money and the matter of the Knight order of the Kingdom of Kuzehra is over.</p> <p>“Well, I’ll go then”</p> <p>Zeid looks at Youssef, while cracking his fingers.<br /> Youssef is sweeping off the knights, who are still scrambling to defeat him, as if they were dust.</p> <p>“I don&#8217;t see any decrease in his magic power at all. Well, with that amount, no one can&#8217;t even tell if it&#8217;s gone down or not.”<br /> “Saviour-sama!”</p> <p>As he was trying to figure out how to deal with Youssef ――― Sufi&#8217;s voice reached him.</p> <p>“Sa,Saviour?” (TN: The kanji used here can also mean Messiah)</p> <p>Suddenly, Zeid became puzzled by the strange way he was called.<br /> However, Sufi has no time for idle explanations.<br /> She simply hands out a stick wrapped in linen.</p> <p>“I didn&#8217;t bring it with me because I came here prepared to have an honorable death, but if the Savior-sama is here, then that&#8217;s a different story! I contacted an external party and now it has finally arrived! Please use this!”</p> <p>When she removed the linen, a stick barely resembling a sword was inside it.<br /> However, it is rusted and doesn’t seem usable.</p> <p>“……No, it’s just the feeling.”<br /> “Ah. This is that, if Zeid-san holds it, it will surely respond! Even now, see! Here! It&#8217;s shining a little!”</p> <p>Sufi points to a part of the suspicious sword that is no longer seriously holding its own original form.<br /> Indeed, a faint magic power was leaking from it and shining brilliantly.</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div> <p>“Hmm”<br /> “Ju,just hold it in your hand and you&#8217;ll understand!”<br /> “No, it’s not like that. I&#8217;m not that good at swordsmanship.”<br /> “Eh……!?”</p> <p>Sufi&#8217;s eyes became dotted at the unexpected response.<br /> And she looks slightly in despair.</p> <p>“Surely, that is something to consider &#8230;..! Because the holy sword reacted, I became festive too much……!”<br /> “My bad. So with that said, I’m going”<br /> “Ah……! At least put it on your waist!”</p> <p>Sufi says so, but if there is a foreign object on the waist, it will be difficult to move.<br /> It’s natural that he can&#8217;t take a sword with him.<br /> He uses the wall as a springboard to leap to Youssef.<br /> The wall explodes with a strong thud.<br /> Sufi, who was nearby, was protected by Fir after Zeid made eye contact with her.<br /> Zeid shortened the distance between him and Youssef in an instant.<br /> But he won’t thrust into him this time.<br /> He just lands nearby and tells the knights.</p> <p>“You’ve done well so far. I&#8217;ll take care of the rest.”<br /> “““Yes!”””</p> <p>The knights give up their places at Zeid&#8217;s words.<br /> He was an S-rank adventurer, and after seeing the one-sided battle he had with the demons earlier, everyone understood that there was no one else suitable for the job but Zeid.</p> <p>“First Form—— 【Flash】“</p> <p>Zeid casted a magic.<br /> His chant is accompanied by a unique voice that is different from the chants that are popular in the world to make the image easier to understand.<br /> A sharp wind strokes from the side, aiming at Youssef&#8217;s neck. Youssef points his right hand at the movement of the invisible wind blade.</p> <p>“This level of magic is nothing to――&#8221;</p> <p>It is like he’s catching Fir&#8217;s sword.<br /> It was as if he could see through Zeid&#8217;s magic.<br /> However, the moment the invisible blade touched Youssef&#8217;s steel skin, blood splattered.</p> <p>“……Kuh!!”</p> <p>He instantly senses that it is an order of magnitude sharper and averts his upper body. With that, he narrowly avoids it.<br /> The magic sword he’s holding disappears naturally. Youssef raises his head.<br /> Youssef&#8217;s arm, which was cut in two like wood split by an axe up to the elbow of his right arm, hangs down.<br /> He felt intense pain from it and held it with his left hand.</p> <p>“You bastard!”</p> <p>Blood spilled out from his skin which he was confident in its toughness――,<br /> Youssef, whose pride was hurt by that, shouted with anger.</p> <p>“What the, you’re surprisingly fragile”<br /> &#8220;You human beings are too arrogaaaaaaant!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'> <!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 --> <div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div> <p>Youssef was enraged by Zeid&#8217;s words of instigation.<br /> However, if.<br /> ―― If he had tried to accept it as it was.<br /> Youssef’s head grew cold enough as he thought back on that.</p> <p>“I see, so you’re stronger than Fir. But so what? You think you can win just because you hurt me!?”</p> <p>Zeid did not respond to Youssef&#8217;s words.<br /> Instead, he made sure that the knights had left.</p> <p>“Third form ―― 【Blaze Proliferation】”</p> <p>Zeid utters his next magic.<br /> Countless thorns of flame grow from the ground in numerous places.<br /> This time, Youssef did not let his guard down.</p> <p>&#8220;Rilvrai Brace!&#8221;</p> <p>Yusef releases an ice-based magic to offset Zeid&#8217;s magic.<br /> Wavy ice spreads around Youssef.</p> <p>“How can the demons be inferior to the humans in terms of quantity and quality of magic power &#8230;&#8230;wha!?&#8221;</p> <p>Every time Zeid&#8217;s thorns touch it, the ice evaporates.<br /> It doesn&#8217;t even buy him a moment&#8217;s time.<br /> Rather, the ice was blocking Youssef&#8217;s own vision ―― he found himself surrounded by thorns of fire to his left, right, front and back. A thorn of flame also surrounded him over his head as if it were looking into Youssef himself.</p> <p>(But it is so powerful &#8230;&#8230;! If he was from a human race, it should only be a one-shot-only great magic &#8230;&#8230;! Then, if I could just stop this!)</p> <p>Youssef unleashes the magic power in his body.<br /> At the same time, a roar like the roar of a beast rings out.</p> <p>“Uooooooooohhh! Rilvrai Brace! Rilvrai Brace!! Rilvrai Braceeeeeeeeee!!!!”</p> <p>Youssef, with nowhere to run, screams and shouts as he fires a series of magic spells using his excess magic power.<br /> The thorns of the flame had disappeared because of dozens and dozens of layers of magic he used.</p> <p>“Fu……fuhahaha! How is it! I&#8217;ve wiped out your full power! This, is a realm that a race of humans like you will never reach! And the ability of the man who will become the Demon King!!”<br /> “Forth form —— 【Lightning Hammer】”<br /> “……Ha?”</p> <p>Youssef&#8217;s suspended cheeks cramped. He looked up fearfully overhead, where he heard a crackling sound.<br /> In there was a lightning-shaped mallet of a size that could easily grind up a person.</p>
<p>“I,it’s a bluff! Such form is fake……!”</p> <p>The mallet closes in on him at a speed unimaginable for its massive mass.<br /> Youssef, who was only verbally vigorous, moves to distance himself using transfer magic.</p> <p>“Transfer!”</p> <p>—— and that&#8217;s where Youssef gets a hunch.<br /> Transfer magic takes a long time to activate for the enormous amount of magic power it consumes.<br /> One must have a clear image of where they are and where they are moving, and how they are moving and what they have done, and so on.<br /> That&#8217;s why.<br /> There was no way that Zeid would have missed the slight gap that this created. However, Zeid did not make the slightest move.<br /> The lightning hammer is so powerful that not even Zeid can get close to it.</p> <p>“――you have good instincts.”</p> <p>Zeid, who sensed it from Youssef&#8217;s looks, praises him honestly.<br /> However ――― for Youssef, they were offensive words.</p>  <p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0671-728x1024.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1024" /></p> <p>“Such composure――”</p> <p>The landscape appears to blur for a moment when he activated his transfer.<br /> The next time Youssef appeared, he was at the minimum distance possible to avoid damage from the hammer. Though he was still in the square.<br /> However, it turned out to be a setback.</p> <p>“――don’t show it to me!”<br /> “But the only good thing about you is your instincts. You’re not very good at identifying where to transition.”</p> <p>At the area where Youssef had transitioned, Zeid had also appeared.<br /> Youssef was blown away, while being terrified by Zeid&#8217;s strange presence. He finally realized he had been kicked a moment later.<br /> As he sorted through the situation, he came to the conclusion that the place where he was kicked to was the place where he was before he used transfer.</p> <p>“Oh, yo――!”</p> <p>Even if he tries to invoke the transfer magic again, he won&#8217;t be able to do it in time. His body is floating in the air, so he cannot avoid it.<br /> He could only glare at the man who kicked him, Zeid.<br /> Dohn, there was a heavy noise like so. Youssef was thrown between the hammer and the ground.<br /> The ground is being burned by lightning strikes.<br /> Soon, the hammer fizzled out.<br /> All that remained was the ground with a large hole in it.</p> <p>“Ah,agaaaaaah……”</p> <p>A weak cry of pain comes from the center of the hole.</p> <p>“You’re still alive, huh. Just as I expected”</p> <p>Zeid looks at the hole.<br /> Puzu, puzu, he has burnt and darkened skin. A face distorted with frustration.</p> <p>“I’ll do another one, I guess. 【Lightning Hammer】”<br /> “――a…… wh,why, why, why does a monster like you exist in the human race!?”<br /> “Monster? Well, I may be a little strong, but it&#8217;s just the way it is when you live in the forbidden forest depths for a long time. It&#8217;s not a big reason.”<br /> “Forbidden forest depths……is it? In an S-rank designated area? Is that really all there is? There is a human race like you&#8230;&#8230;! Impossible! Impossible! How can you be that strong!? Are you also different &#8230;&#8230;!”<br /> “I don’t know, that kind of thing. Well then”</p> <p>With that said, Zeid dropped his hammer――<br /> The hole was widened deeper by the second hammer.<br /> Zeid walks on the scorched ground to identify Youssef&#8217;s body.<br /> The tattered corpse did not retain its original shape. Some parts were missing or have been turned to ash.<br /> But there was definitely a corpse.</p> <p>“He&#8217;s dead. But how can a corpse remain after being hit twice by that magic?&#8221;</p> <p>Zeid looked down with a little admiration.<br /> The vast amount of magic power that Youssef had accumulated still clings to his corpse, even though it lost its place with the loss of his physical body.<br /> When it was all said and done, it was an overwhelming victory.<br /> But Youssef still had a large amount of magic power left.<br /> His fighting style was using bruteforse. In terms of fighting techniques, he was no match for Zeid.<br /> ……But things might have changed if he had a lot of combat experience.</p> <p>&#8220;Did he call himself one of the Seven Great Demon Aristocrats, or the next Demon King?”</p> <p>Zeid was in the service of the country, even temporarily.<br /> That is why he can see the end of this battle somehow.<br /> Even just for the sake of it, many people from different countries had gathered. This definitely created a crack between the human race and the demon tribe.<br /> Whether it is an action with the people in mind or a performance, there is not one country that will want to move.<br /> Zeid turns around.</p> <p>(……I&#8217;m sure many people died, no matter how many Soria and Sufi have rescued them.)</p> <p>The wall has collapsed.<br /> People have been damaged by the demons.<br /> Initially, the Knights of the Holy Republic, that came from the outside, were not able to cope with the demons who were inside.<br /> So those who tried to escape first must have died. Their bodies were clustered near the doorway.<br /> Though no one can ever blame them for being responsible for their own actions. Since it is a natural reaction.<br /> This time, it is a one-sided attack by the demons.</p> <p>(The morale of the human race will be boosted, no doubt. It&#8217;s no longer a situation that can be suppressed by reason)</p> <p>The influence of the Astea religion, which had been a cover for the demons, must have fallen.<br /> Religion is not just about giving hope. It is not just a place to escape to, a place to depend on.<br /> It also serves as a pointer to a way of life.<br /> What will happen to the believers when they learn that they have been shown that the demon tribe has deceived the congregation of Astea?<br /> This situation was very bad.<br /> Youssef left a big mark even in his death.</p> <p>“Zeid-san!”</p> <p>A girl&#8217;s voice calls out from behind him.<br /> When Zeid turned around, Sufi was running up to him.</p> <p>“What is it?”</p> <p>He looked at Sufi and also at the people behind her at the same time.<br /> The demons were totally defeated, and all personnel were devoted to rescue efforts.<br /> It seems that Youssef was the only one left.</p> <p>“What happened to Zai Fonde!?”<br /> “He’s dead……. You shouldn’t look at him”<br /> “No, it’s fine. I&#8217;m used to it.”</p> <p>Sufi looks into Youssef&#8217;s corpse.<br /> She didn’t gape or turn pale.<br /> Perhaps because of her experience in crossing battlefields like Soria, Sufi seemed to be accustomed to this level of corpses.<br /> Sufi nodded once as she identified the body.</p> <p>“Now I&#8217;m sure I can start over with the Astea religion. I’m glad. I’m really glad……! Thank you very much, Zeid-san!”<br /> “You don’t need to thank me. I was just passing.”<br /> “And yet you saved the people here. We could not have helped so many people on our own. …….Really, thank you so much!”</p> <p>Sufi bowed her head and thanked him from the bottom of her heart.</p> <p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p> <p>The collapsed statue of the goddess didn’t retain its original form, though the square&#8217;s pedestal barely remained.<br /> Sufi stands on the pedestal, picks up a loudspeaker, and calls out to those who still remain inside and outside the square.</p> <p>『Please listen, everyone! 』</p> <p>Everyone turns their gaze to Sufi&#8217;s voice.</p> <p>『Just now, the 7th demon aristocrat Youssef and all the demons under his control have been wiped out! By the Knights of the Holy Republic, Fir the Sword Saint, and Zeid, an S-rank adventurer! 』<br /> “““Uooooo!!!!”””</p> <p>People shouted in sync with Sufi&#8217;s voice, as if they had been waiting for that.<br /> Everyone was fighting.<br /> Some cheered when they saw the knights fighting the demons. Others assisted in the rescue operations. Some endeavored to escape.<br /> All of them were fighting for survival, albeit in different forms.<br /> That is why Sufi&#8217;s declaration of victory was accepted by everyone.</p> <p>『It&#8217;s all right, everyone. Even if we are attacked by demons like this, there is hope for the human race! There is the Saint Soria-sama who rescues the injured people. The knights and Zeid-sama who stroke down everything that came at them&#8230;&#8230; And there are everyone! There is always salvation――!』</p> <p>She threw around such words that give people hope.<br /> Her words strangely seeped into the hearts of those who heard them. Sufi, who brought the True Astaire religion together at an early age, might have the power to move people&#8217;s hearts.<br /> Zeid glanced sideways at Sufi and walked away from the square.</p> <p>(&#8230;&#8230;With her, the future might not be as bleak as I think. Perhaps my fears were unfounded.)</p> <p>Zeid had such a thought.</p> <p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p> <p>&#8220;Wait, Zeid. Where are you going”</p> <p>I was at a short distance away from the square.<br /> I was called out at the spot where I was approaching the forest.</p> <p>“Where, you said. I&#8217;m going home, though. What about you, Fir?”</p> <p>She must have been in a hurry to catch up to me.<br /> Fir was there, breathing a little on her shoulder.</p> <p>“If you ask me what it&#8217;s about, then there&#8217;s a lot of things that it makes it hard for me to answer. &#8230;&#8230;”<br /> “Is it about the apology? Then I really don&#8217;t need it. You should just apologize to Quena and Sheila.”<br /> “A,ah. I&#8217;ll do that. It&#8217;s a little awkward, though.”<br /> “I&#8217;ll go with you if you want. Since I owe them an apology too.”<br /> “Why Zeid? This is my problem.”<br /> “I&#8217;m the one who got them into this, even if only indirectly, so I owe them an apology, don&#8217;t I?&#8221;</p> <p>I think that much makes sense.<br /> Then it would be easier to apologize together.<br /> Fir looked away from me awkwardly.</p> <p>“I see, that’s right. I&#8217;ve caused you that much trouble, too, huh.”<br /> “Ah, indeed. You thrusted yourself in there without thinking, and this was the result.”</p> <p>I say stingingly.</p> <p>“I&#8217;m really sorry &#8230;&#8230;, but that doesn&#8217;t mean I should overlook Soria-sama as well.”<br /> “Why the heck did Soria come out there?&#8221;<br /> “It is! It&#8217;s because I&#8217;ve been by Soria-sama&#8217;s side all the time. That’s why, Soria-sama&#8217;s impression of me is&#8230;&#8230;”<br /> “It can’t go down, right. Your thought process is messed up.”<br /> “……Ugh”</p> <p>I think that was a terrible thing to say, but she didn&#8217;t even argue with me.<br /> I don&#8217;t think she has the energy for it.</p> <p>“Don&#8217;t get too hung up on a single thing. Think about something else at your comfort.”</p> <p>I give her some advice for the time being and continue talking.</p> <p>“So, I know this changes the story, but you said there were a lot of things, right? Is there anything else you want to say?”<br /> “A,ah. You know, Soria-sama has been wanting to talk to you for a long time. But it was hard for her to find an opportunity. So now that you&#8217;re close by, why don&#8217;t you meet and talk to her?”</p> <p>Now is the chance.<br /> After all, this girl&#8217;s thought process is Soria first.<br /> That&#8217;s probably why she&#8217;s messed up.<br /> She could have just asked the guild directly about the Charisma party, but she came to me. Well, I guess that&#8217;s partly due to the power of her voice.<br /> Even if that were the case, it would be a bad notion to even pick a fight with Quena and Sheila to gauge my ability.</p> <p>“But, Soria and I are both members of the Charisma Party, aren&#8217;t we? I don&#8217;t have to go all the way there now that she is busy. I&#8217;ll meet her sooner or later.”</p> <p>The fact that Soria is not here with Fir means that she is probably still working on the rescue operation.<br /> Then I can&#8217;t go and interfere with her.<br /> I also don&#8217;t have time to wait until the rescue operation is over.</p> <p>“That’s true, but……”<br /> “Ah, geez. Stop with the hesitation. You probably don&#8217;t have that kind of personality. Just say what you want to say clearly”<br /> “……Ah. Okay, I&#8217;ll say it. I admit. I admit it. Zeid&#8217;s ability is indeed amazing! Better than me! But! I have more feelings for Soria-sama than you do! Because I was the first one to run to Youssef to save Soria-sama!”</p> <p>She says, pointing at me directly, as if declaring war.</p> <p>“Isn’t that because there was a difference in the distance between Fir and me? You were right under the pedestal and I was away from the center. No matter how anyone thinks about it, you will be able to respond faster.”<br /> “Ah, certainly……”</p> <p>Ugh &#8230;&#8230; like so, Fir became down.<br /> This girl is a pain in the ass. I wonder if I can leave her alone.<br /> No, if I leave her alone, she will come after me later.</p> <p>“But, well, if I were in the same position as you, I&#8217;m not sure I would have made the same decision. Your feelings for Soria are definitely greater than mine.”<br /> “!! That’s right!? Indeed!? You&#8217;re a good guy!”<br /> “O,oh”</p> <p>Suddenly she got up with a high tension.<br /> What an emotionally unstable guy, this girl is.</p> <p>“Ah, I&#8217;ve got a great idea.”<br /> “……What is it?”</p> <p>Supplementing that, Fir suddenly claps her hands and says with a big smile.</p> <p>“Actually, a scout came to me from the guild. I&#8217;ll ask them if I can join the Charisma party!”<br /> “……”<br /> “Eh? What? Where are you going, Zeid! Hey!”</p> <p>A voice calls out from behind me.</p> <p>It’s not good. This girl is troublesome.<br /> Let&#8217;s leave without minding her.<br /> Thus, I returned to the inn.</p>

<p><strong><a style= "text-decoration:none;" href="">Chapter 6 &#8211; Formation</a></strong></p>


<p>At the Guild Master&#8217;s office.</p>
<p>Sitting on chairs facing each other, are me and Riff.</p>

<p>“Zeid, this is a great troublesome thing”</p>

<p>Riff puts out the large newspaper on the desk with a dexterous expression of a quietly <em>beaming happily</em> face. She guides my gaze by indicating the newspaper with his chin.</p>
<p>As I look at it as I was told, on one side,</p>

<p>『A new generation of heroes! 』</p>
<p>『Discover that the Astea religion has been taken over by demons and overthrow the 7th demon aristocrat, Youssef! 』</p>
<p>『Irresistible Force! 』</p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>And so on was written.</p>
<p>With a photo of my face.</p>
<p>Riff’s beaming face would be because this would increase the guild&#8217;s name recognition and credibility.</p>

<p>“Business is thriving huh”</p>
<p>“You are quite calm. You should be happy about this, you know?”</p>
<p>“Well, I&#8217;m sure it&#8217;s good for the guild to have their name out there, but it feels pleasant to have it easier to get the right number of nominations and emergency requests like I am getting now.”</p>
<p>“You’ve accepted all the requests I asked you to do, sir~. You’re very conscientious. That’s cool!”</p>

<p>I&#8217;m not interested in being a hero.</p>
<p>I had no idea that the Astea religion had been taken over by demons.</p>
<p>It also said irresistible force…… <em>I was just caught up in the whole thing, you know.</em></p>

<p>“Newspapers aren’t very good at what they write. It is composed of lies here and there.”</p>
<p>“Since that’s their job. Because the Astea religion has been disgraced, we need heroes who can be celebrated in the mix of truth and falsehood.”</p>
<p>“They want me to be the one who gets set up high without permission, though&#8221;</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p>Well, if it&#8217;s good for the guild then it&#8217;s fine.</p>

<p>“So, what do you want from me?”</p>

<p>I am here today because Riff has called me.</p>
<p>It may also be because of a request.</p>

<p>“Actually, I&#8217;d like to get Zeid&#8217;s opinion.”</p>

<p>A touch of uneasiness passed through my mind.</p>

<p>“It’s about the charisma party. I added two new members to the list.”</p>
<p>“Two members……No, I can somewhat predict one of them.”</p>
<p>“Really? Well, it&#8217;s not surprising that you became good friends at the Great Holy Prayer Place. Yes, the 【Sword Saint】 Fir has joined the guild.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p>Riff placed several documents on the desk.</p>
<p>The face on it was Fir. There was other information necessary for her to become an adventurer, such as her accomplishments and combat experience.</p>
<p>I pick up the appropriate materials and look at them.</p>
<p>I knew it. Fir has strange conduct. Moreover, no one can predict what she will do when Soria is involved.</p>
<p>Of course, the reason she joined the guild was&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>“She wants to join the charisma party, is that what you’re saying?”</p>
<p>“I am thinking of approving her. Though there will be so much opposition.”</p>
<p>“Since she’s a successful person and a stranger. She’ll become a target of jealousy”</p>
<p>“Well yeah. She just joined the guild, and the S rank slot was filled this year by Zeid, so she stopped at A rank. ……But, there is no doubt that her ability and name recognition are among the top in the guild. The time for the next S-rank test is almost here.”</p>

<p>Riff has her arms crossed with her mouth turned down at the corners.</p>
<p>Maybe she hasn&#8217;t made up her mind yet.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>“I&#8217;m not going to say anything.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure? It&#8217;s your party.”</p>
<p>“She is one of the strongest I have ever met, except for the fact that she is a bit on the wild side. And her degree of popularity, if the guild has decided that it&#8217;s not a problem, then there’s nothing I can say about it.”</p>
<p>“Fumu.”</p>

<p>Riff&#8217;s eyebrow wrinkles.</p>
<p>Her stubborn and distressed appearance looked adorable, perhaps due to the gap between her childish figure and the way she moves.</p>

<p>“If even the 【Sword Saint】 were to join, support for the guild would become even stronger. If you don&#8217;t have anything to say, then I will accept her proposal.”</p>

<p>It appears that she has made up her mind.</p>
<p>Then the topic changes.</p>

<p>“And what about the other one? Do I know them?”</p>
<p>“You don&#8217;t know her, I guess. Though I wonder if you have seen her?”</p>

<p>With a slam, Riff puts documents on the desk again.</p>
<p>This time there were fewer pages compared to Fir.</p>
<p>She has straight, unruffled black hair. Her skin is so white and fine that you can see it even from just her picture. There’s a tear mole under her right eye. She wears a military uniform, though her chest is bulging out.</p>
<p>She is probably in her late teens.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>The document said that she belongs to a unit of the Weira Empire<em>. I wonder which unit she belongs to.</em></p>
<p>The most notable –– was that it was written she was a former S-rank.</p>

<p>“Yui. The youngest girl to reach the S rank in the guild.”</p>
<p>“The youngest, huh, she must be amazing. But she belongs to the empire now, doesn&#8217;t she? It was said that she was headhunted, though”</p>
<p>“The empire heard about the Charisma party from somewhere. And then they introduced Yui.”</p>
<p>“Why again?”</p>
<p>“I think she was originally assigned to a covert unit, but the upper echelons of the empire may have changed their mind and decided to make her a 『hero status』.”</p>
<p>“Hero status?”</p>
<p>“You, defeated Bashina, right. The head of the Zeroth Army.”</p>
<p>“……?”</p>

<p>I tilt my head when I was told so.</p>
<p>It’s probably a person’s name, but I can&#8217;t remember who it is.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>“You forgot? He was a general in the empire you defeated. He was formerly an S-ranked adventurer, so he was headhunted.”</p>
<p>“Hou”</p>
<p>“They have to fill in a general-level existence which he was in charge of…… in other words, a hero-level existence. It is self-evident that Bashina will lose value by losing. If so, the Empress will not forgive his defeat. That’s why, Yui was chosen, and their notion was to make a name for herself with the Charisma Party.”</p>
<p>“Make a name? If she isn’t popular, what&#8217;s the benefit of her joining the party?”</p>
<p>“She&#8217;s just not the type to stand out. Not many people know Yui&#8217;s face. Though there are few people who know Yui&#8217;s face and are her secret admirers. You need someone like that in the party, don&#8217;t you?”</p>
<p>“…… Is that right. But the Weira empire has pulled in quite a few influential people, haven&#8217;t they? It feels like we’re being put to good use, though.”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t worry about that. We receive money whenever they recruit someone from us. In addition, I extracted special conditions, such as tax relief from the Empire.”</p>
<p>“Heh. There&#8217;s a lot going on underneath the surface.”</p>
<p>“The guild is said to have the strength of more than one country. Even the Empire cannot underestimate it.”</p>

<p>I don&#8217;t know what&#8217;s happening on the management side.</p>
<p>If Riff says so, it wouldn&#8217;t be wrong to choose Yui.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t say for sure because I haven&#8217;t seen her, but if I just hear about her ability, I can feel at ease.</p>
<p>However, I have a point of concern.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>“If that girl is a newcomer, then she’ll be an A-rank, right? Besides, there would be a lot of people who’ll object to her returning, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah, those who were S-rank at the time they left the guild can come back as S rank according to the regulations, you know. In terms of ability, she’s still recognized among the adventurers, so it is expected that there will be little resistance.”</p>

<p>This didn&#8217;t seem like much of a problem.</p>
<p>Apparently, she is quite trusted in the guild.</p>

<p>“Well, if the guild says so, I won&#8217;t say anything, and I don&#8217;t have any opinions to offer. ……but, wouldn’t it look bad if half of the party were recruited from outside the guild?”</p>
<p>“Ugh……”</p>

<p>Riff&#8217;s chest is clutching her chest, as if she has been hit with the sharpest point.</p>
<p>However, she looked at me straight in the eye, without giving me an objection.</p>

<p>“&#8230;&#8230;To be frank, in my mind, I&#8217;m planning to announce you as an official party with these two members as it is.”</p>
<p>“That means you&#8217;re prepared to be criticized.&#8221;’</p>
<p>“That’s because! No S-rank have accepted the offer <em>ja mon</em>! If so, I&#8217;ll just have to find someone else <em>ja mon</em>!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“Yeah, <em>ja mon ja mon, </em>don’t be fussy. Don&#8217;t come crying to me, alright!&#8221;</p>

<p>The little girl tries to cry on my chest by leaning her body against the desk when she can&#8217;t stand it while releasing moisture from her eyes and nose.</p>
<p>This girl is self-proclaimed to be quite old, but she&#8217;s probably too emotional and explosive.</p>
<p>Well, I guess there are a lot of things that she has endured, though&#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p><em>Gusu</em>, <em>gusu</em>, with tears in her eyes, Riff finally regained her composure and returned to her seat.</p>

<p>“I don&#8217;t know what to say, but shouldn&#8217;t you just delay the announcement?”</p>
<p>“Gusu…… N,no, it shouldn’t be delayed”</p>
<p>“Why? If you delay the announcement a little and let them accumulate achievements and get used to it, there should be no problem, right”</p>

<p>Both Yui and Fir joined the guild and immediately became part of the party in which they are representatives, and it would cause criticism and backlash.</p>
<p>Then it shouldn&#8217;t be &#8220;immediate&#8221;.</p>
<p>If they work in the guild for six months up to a year, people in the surroundings will recognize them. By that time, Fir will be able to take the S-rank exam.</p>

<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“I agree with you on that point. However, the invasion by Youssef, one of the Seventh Demon Aristocrat, has created a need for a pillar of the human race.”</p>

<p>Riff put her finger on the newspaper I had just read.</p>
<p>As if to say that this is what the big headline is for.</p>

<p>“The Astea religion has collapsed, and their credibility was lost. The true Astea religion was on the rise, but, being used by the demon tribe, the people’s trust in the goddess Astea wasn’t restored yet. For that reason, even the existence of the hero chosen by Astea would be&#8230;&#8230;.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Has the number of those who don&#8217;t expect <em>them</em> start to increase?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that&#8217;s where the new pillar of the human race, the Charisma Party, comes in.”</p>
<p>“I see. So the plan is to move quickly to convert that segment of the population into our supporters, huh”</p>
<p>“Well, I didn&#8217;t ask you to think that far ahead. Just go about your activities as usual. Solve complicated problems in the guild, etc.”</p>

<p>Without even trying to hide her reddened eyes, she puffed out her chest, as if saying &#8220;Leave it to me and just aboard the ship”.</p>
<p>Her face is somewhat proud.</p>

<p>“For the time being, if Zeid is okay with it, then we need to have a face-to-face meeting. Let me know what time is convenient for you――”</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇◇</p>

<p>After my discussion with Riff, I stopped by the stall.</p>

<p>“Skewered Meat &#8230;&#8230; er, about ten.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes. It’s 100,000 gold coins.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Yes, here are ten copper coins.”</p>

<p>I let the stall owner&#8217;s lighthearted joke slide and hand him the copper coins. In return, he gives me a burlap sack containing ten meat skewers.</p>
<p>However, this is not for me to eat.</p>
<p>It is something I’ll take to the two people who are now returning to the royal capital after completing their request.</p>
<p>I go to the front of the house where the two people in question are staying.</p>
<p>The house is built in a prime location in the royal capital.</p>
<p>The site itself is not large, but it has a garden with trees and a second floor that seems unnecessary for a single person to live in.</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>It is a mansion with a red roof that matches the owner&#8217;s hair color.</p>
<p>I knocked on the front door and it opened.</p>

<p>“A’re, Zeid”</p>

<p>Quena peeks her head out.</p>
<p>In the back, Sheila was walking down the hallway with a piece of bread in her mouth.</p>

<p>“Ooh, Zeid!”</p>

<p>As soon as Sheila sees my face, she comes toward me with a piece of bread in her mouth.</p>
<p>Both of them seem to be doing well.</p>

<p>“Here, take this.”</p>

<p>I hand them a skewer of meat I just bought at a street vendor.</p>
<p>It was received by Sheila.</p>

<p>“Eh, what, what? If you&#8217;re going to propose, you&#8217;re supposed to give a ring, right?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? Fir picked a fight with you guys the other day, right. It’s an apology for that. I guess I got you involved in my problems. I&#8217;m sorry.&#8221;</p>

<p>I evaded Sheila&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>Quena smiled bitterly at the skewered meat I handed them.</p>

<p>“You, so you’ll give meat skewers? In times like this, you should give something more expensive.”</p>
<p>“……Is that so? I only heard that when you apologize, you need to bring a gift. Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Well, considering the circumstances, I think it can’t be helped.”</p>

<p>Quena is bitterly but not fully satisfied with the meat skewers, complaining a little about them while stuffing them in her mouth.</p>
<p>Ah, she was saying a lot of things, but she eats.</p>
<p>Sheila also took out a piece and put it in her mouth.</p>

<p>“This is delicious. Well, I don&#8217;t go to street stalls or cafeterias these days because I&#8217;ve been cooking by hand all the time. I&#8217;m the type of person who does a lot of home cooking.”</p>

<p>Making glimpses at me, Sheila looks at me and stresses the phrase &#8220;home cooking”.</p>

<p>“Even if you say home cooking, you just roasted the monsters you hunted.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I have said it, right?! I didn&#8217;t see any spices and seasonings!”</p>

<p>Sheila is puffing out her cheeks at Quena&#8217;s tell-tale(?).</p>
<p>These girls are good friends.</p>

<p>“No, well, I&#8217;ll admit it tasted good.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ehehe. How about you, Zeid? I’m sure it will warm your heart to have someone cook for you when you’re traveling in the wild!?”</p>

<p>Sheila brings her face close to mine with a giggle.</p>

<p>“A blatant appeal heh……”</p>

<p>Quena says, holding her head.</p>
<p>I ask, not grasping the meaning of her words.</p>

<p>“Appeal?”</p>
<p>“It means she wants to join the Charisma Party.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ah. by the way, it looks like the party is going to be filled with people.”</p>

<p>I told them what I heard from Riff earlier.</p>
<p>The two looked surprised by it.</p>
<p>Sheila, in particular, is pitching forward.</p>

<p>“I didn&#8217;t hear that, though!&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s because I was shown the member candidates just some time ago. It looks like we were going to meet face to face. One of the two is a familiar face, though.”</p>
<p>“Familiar face? Come to think of it, who are the members? To leave an A rank like me behind&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Ah. They were Fir, the rampaging sword saint, and a girl named Yui, whom I don&#8217;t know very well but was originally an S rank.”</p>
<p>“……Tsu!?”</p>

<p>As soon as she heard the name, Quena&#8217;s eyes widened.</p>
<p>Then she puts strength in her palms.</p>

<p>“Both of them have turned towards the guild; these people have become a topic of discussion for joining the party. I&#8217;ve heard a lot of murmurs about them, but I didn&#8217;t realize it was because they’re going into the Charisma party. Well, I guess that&#8217;s fair.&#8221;</p>

<p>Sheila seemed to have come to a point. She didn&#8217;t seem as surprised as Quena.</p>

<p>“You don’t seem to be that surprised. Quena appears quite surprised, though”</p>
<p>“Since thinking about it, I&#8217;d rather aspire to be in Zeid’s party rather than the charisma party.”</p>
<p>“I,is that so”</p>

<p>I feel happy about the straightforwardness of her feelings, but it’s also embarrassing.</p>

<p>“How is it? What do you think about having a competent member who can do all the housework and even fight?”</p>
<p>“No, I&#8217;m sure you&#8217;d be a great help, but there&#8217;s something about the pace of the request.”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll even take care of you sexually.”</p>

<p>Sheila pulls her ample breasts together.</p>
<p>Her two hemispheres, clearly far above average in size, were squishily reshaped.</p>

<p>“Kuh……! The temptation is so great &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>

<p>That pose spurred Sheila&#8217;s charm.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve been living an ascetic life up until now, so I was too happy to see it, that it even became poison to my eyes.</p>

<p>“It looks like I’m one step closer. If so ――&#8221;</p>

<p>Sheila approaches and tries to strike the finishing blow.</p>
<p>But before she could do so, Quena, who had been silent, opened her mouth.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Hey, Yui, you said, that Yui &#8230;&#8230;that the Empire have pulled out?&#8221;</p>
<p>“From my point of view, I only know one girl named Yui, but well, it’s that Yui.”</p>
<p>“No, you&#8217;re right. It was that Yui who came back to the guild, wasn&#8217;t it?”</p>

<p>She asked only about Yui, not Fir, who had caused a problem for her.</p>
<p>It was not about the party, it was about the Empire that&#8217;s involved with Yui ―― and by extension, it was probably also her pent-up feelings for her sister.</p>
<p>Especially for the one called Yui, who is S rank and has been pulled out by the empire.</p>
<p>In other words, Yui, for Quena, is――.</p>

<p>&#8220;Yui was my goal. Just like you.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s right”</p>

<p>It seems like Quena was more mindful of me than before. She was very open and honest with me.</p>
<p>This one is easier and more straightforward.</p>

<p>&#8220;Such a girl is going to the charisma party next time&#8230;&#8230; to stand next to you.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>

<p>Quena&#8217;s face is dark. Her face is gloomy.</p>
<p>I wonder why. I had a feeling that if I don&#8217;t do something, I’ll feel bad.</p>
<p>Quena is an important person to me.</p>
<p>Since she took care of me.</p>
<p>Since she’s easy to talk to.</p>
<p>Since she was the first person I was able to open up to after leaving the Order.</p>
<p>So naturally, words come out of my throat without any poking and prodding.</p>

<p>&#8220;If, you&#8217;re willing not to prioritize the Charisma Party, why don&#8217;t you form a party with me?”</p>

<p>That may not be the solution.</p>
<p>But, it’s only temporary.</p>
<p>I was hoping that these words would become a substitute for Quena&#8217;s stabilizers, or so I thought.</p>

<p>“Eh!”</p>
<p>“Are you sure!? Quena and I can join!&#8221;</p>

<p>Quena and Sheila are astonished by the sudden offer.</p>
<p>I had no intention of saying anything about Sheila, but they seem to be in a party, so I guess it was a natural progression.</p>
<p>Ah,</p>

<p>&#8220;No, it may seem like I lost to Sheila&#8217;s temptation for some reason, but that&#8217;s not the case. You two are strong and have common sense and knowledge that I lack. I am managing to fix it, but it&#8217;s going to come out ragged like the gifts I gave you earlier&#8230;&#8230;”</p>

<p><img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/0811-728x1024.jpg" alt="" width="728" height="1024" /></p>

<p>“I don&#8217;t mind taking care of you in a sexual way at all! Right, Quena”</p>
<p>&#8220;Whoa! Where are you touching! I am &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>

<p>Sheila pulls Quena&#8217;s chest closer as well.</p>
<p>Quena has good boobs as well&#8230;&#8230;!</p>
<p><em>This is bad.</em></p>
<p>I think my mind will go haywire when I form this party.</p>

<p>“But if it&#8217;s a party, I&#8217;d like another person. Preferably someone in charge of healing!”</p>

<p>Sheila says as she munchingly changes the shape of Quena&#8217;s rich fruit.</p>

<p>“Aside from healing, even if it’s just us…… hmm…… it&#8217;s about time you stopped touching &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>

<p>The always determined Quena leaks out a weak voice.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about! We&#8217;ve come this far, we&#8217;re going to overthrow the Charisma Party!”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m kind of in the charisma party myself, though&#8221;</p>
<p>“Except for Zeid! The other three and our three are going at them!”</p>

<p>Sheila gets strangely breathless.</p>
<p>It seems that she was thinking about Queena in her own way.</p>
<p>Indeed, if they were to win from the charisma party, it would give Quena confidence. Even Ruina will not be able to ignore Quena.</p>

<p>“Zeid-san! I finally found you &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>

<p>Suddenly, a voice reaches me from behind.</p>
<p>Looking back. This is a prime location, but there are only a few pedestrians, and only one person was behind me. Therefore, I immediately recognized the voice&#8217;s owner.</p>

<p>“Sufi, is it? What happened?&#8221;</p>

<p>She exudes a leader-like presence of the true Astea religion in there.</p>
<p>In her hand is a stick wrapped in cloth.</p>
<p>I had a vague idea of what her purpose is.</p>

<p>“Please take the Holy Sword! This is what Zeid-san should have!”</p>

<p>Her words were directed at me, which I did not expect.</p>

<p>“Holy Sword! You’re delivering it! ―― Don’t tell me you can use healing magic!?”</p>

<p>Before I could answer, Sheila said something like that.</p>
<p><em>How and why did it happen?</em> Come to think of it, I remembered a famous story I heard a long time ago about a saint delivering a holy sword to a hero.</p>
<p>Once upon a time, in a hero’s party ――.</p>
<p>A devout saint handed the holy sword to the man to whom the sword responded ―― a man who would become the hero.</p>
<p>Sheila must have felt a sense of déjà vu, since the situation is similar.</p>

<p>“Ju,just a little……?”</p>

<p>Sufi replied, puzzled.</p>
<p>The party was a half-conceived proposal in the hope that it would be a stabilizing agent for Quena, but it took an increasingly unexpected turn.</p>
<p>Sheila was talking to Sufi, waving her hands around as if she was trying to solicit her. Eventually, after a seemingly successful negotiations, Sheila points a finger high in the sky and declares,</p>

<p>“――Now, let’s overthrow the charisma party!”</p>

<p>Such loud words from Sheila echoed.</p>

<p>“N,no, I really don&#8217;t have time for that!”</p>

<p>Sufi is somewhat stiff.</p>
<p>It seems that she was solicited quite forcibly and with great vigor.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;m not looking to overthrow them, either.”</p>
<p>“What~……!”</p>
<p>“Hey, don&#8217;t get your hands all over me!”</p>

<p>Sheila&#8217;s eyes shine suspiciously.</p>
<p>Quena protects her chest with a sense of danger.</p>

<p>“Even though there are no people, there’s still a fair amount of traffic”</p>
<p>“I won&#8217;t do it if someone is there. By the way, would you like to join us, Zeid!?”</p>

<p>Sheila said so. Reflexively, Quena glares at me.</p>
<p>I turned away involuntarily.</p>

<p>&#8220;&#8230;&#8230; Don’t get me involved.”</p>
<p>“Eeh. It has good tension and feels great to the touch; what a waste!”</p>
<p>“――It&#8217;s time to stop!”</p>

<p>Quena thumps Sheila on the head.</p>
<p>Sheila, whose head was bump, holds her head with both hands with her eyes moistening.</p>

<p>“Tha,that’s too far!”</p>
<p>“That’s my line!”</p>
<p>“Uhmm, so Zeid-san, how about this holy sword &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“No, I can&#8217;t use a sword even if I receive it, and no matter how I think about it, a holy sword will attract trouble, so I don&#8217;t need it.”</p>

<p>I&#8217;ve been getting very busy with various things, such as being subjected to exaggerated fanfare from the public and being in two parties.</p>
<p>Still, I didn&#8217;t mind this busyness.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a rather pleasant busyness, unlike when I was in the Chivalric Order ――.</p>
