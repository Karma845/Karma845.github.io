<b>Chapter 2</b>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1: Empire</strong></p>

<p>There’s a new feature which has been added to the Adventurer Card.</p>
<p>It was about the 『to report news of events happening all over the continent』. Some of the articles in it are conveniently accompanied by images and videos.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about the continent. I had heard from a former colleague that there were several tribes and countries, but when I asked him to draw a map, he could only draw bits and pieces of the Kingdom of Kuzera and its neighboring countries.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why the news update on the card was one of the things I looked forward to.</p>
<p>Today, Riff called me, Quena and Sheila to the Guildmaster&#8217;s office, but the important one, which is that Riff, was not there.</p>
<p>So with that, when I look towards card.</p>


<p>“Oh, a new article has been updated. What is it, what is it, the Weila Empire has a new empress: &#8230;&#8230;hou, hou.”</p>


<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>Apparently, a new head of a country, the Weila Empire, has been chosen.</p>
<p>It was also a female. <em>Congratulations to her.</em></p>


<p>“Heh, a new empress has arrived in the Weila Empire, huh. I remember there was some kind of dispute about it, though.”</p>


<p>Sheila peeks at my adventurer card.</p>
<p>She is standing behind me on the sofa.</p>


<p>“Oh, something about that was written, too. Oh, and the empress&#8217; precious face is also on it. Red hair, and red eyes. &#8230;&#8230; doesn&#8217;t she look a bit like Quena?”</p>
<p>“Ara, that’s true”</p>


<p>Quena, who is sitting on the opposite sofa, looks disinterested and drinks the tea which has been poured into a cup.</p>
<p>After reading the article, it feels like she has the dignity of a real empress.</p>


<p>“There are so many people out there, it wouldn&#8217;t be surprising if they looked like someone else.”</p>

<div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>Quena seemed to have heard what we were talking about and replied in an uninterested manner.</p>
<p>Well, it must be so.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Kingdom of Kuzera and the Empire of Weila do not get along very well. If she was related to the new Empress or whatever she is, she wouldn&#8217;t be in here in the first place. <em>Unless she has some circumstances.</em></p>
<p>As we were talking about this and that, the door was opened with a bang.</p>


<p>“I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m late because of various things!”</p>


<p>A young girl, the master of this room, entered, while shaking her purple hair that reached almost to her knees.</p>
<p>It’s the Guildmaster Riff.</p>


<p>“You&#8217;re late. So, what&#8217;s this about us three people being requested by nomination?”</p>


<p>Quena asked Riff, stuffily.</p>


<p>“Umu, well, rather than the three of you, it’s about those that I recognized as exceptionally talented in Royal Capital. I am thinking of having you accept a nomination request.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>“Understood. What&#8217;s your request?”</p>
<p>“Why are you so quick to understand &#8230;&#8230; At least check the request before you accept it.”</p>


<p>Quena said, while holding her forehead.</p>
<p>Sheila puffed out her cheeks in a muffled gesture toward Quena.</p>


<p>“If Zeid fails, I&#8217;ll make up for it, so it&#8217;s okay!”</p>
<p>“No one said anything about him failing. I can&#8217;t imagine Zeid failing. I&#8217;m just saying you don&#8217;t have to accept everything just because it&#8217;s a request.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha. Well, it&#8217;s been rumored, you know~”</p>


<p>Riff responds to Quena&#8217;s words.</p>


<p>“Rumors? What, is that?”</p>


<p>I was curious and asked.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>I don&#8217;t remember doing anything that would cause rumors to be started.</p>


<p>“You take requests that no one else would take, don&#8217;t you?”</p>
<p>“Ah. I&#8217;m taking it. They got angry at me when I was taking requests at random. It feels like I&#8217;m systematically taking requests that tend to stay.”</p>
<p>“Like looking for lost items in the sewers for F-ranks, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Because no one wants to take it, you know?”</p>


<p>Riff shrugged her shoulders in response to my question, 『Yare yare』. <em>It&#8217;s half annoying and half cute when little girls do that.</em></p>


<p>“What do you think would happen if you, an S-rank, were to take the job?”</p>
<p>“…………Ah, I’ll be spoiling it that is in every other way enjoyable”</p>
<p>“Well, that”</p>


<p>I finally understand and feel a shock like a knife stuck in my heart. I couldn&#8217;t help but open and close my mouth.</p>
<p><em>I see.</em></p>
<p><em>I wonder if it seem like the guild won&#8217;t have a job for me if I take a lower ranked request.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m kind of sorry for that.</p>


<p>“But on the other hand. Even those small requests don’t change the fact that there are clients who have been saved with it. Since you are doing unpopular requests, your stocks from receptionists, adventurers of lower ranks, and people in downtown are also rising.”</p>
<p>“The stock has hit the ceiling!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>“No one is talking about you, Sheila”</p>


<p>Sheila broke in from the side.</p>
<p>To this, Quena offered a calm quip.</p>


<p>“Oops. We’re getting off topic. Therefore, I want you three to accept the nomination request.”</p>
<p>“Is that a request being receive by us as a party?”</p>


<p>Quena asks without a break.</p>
<p>Then, Riff paused for a moment and then grinned boldly.</p>


<p>“Well, I guess you must have an idea of what&#8217;s going on. ——I want you to receive it in solo.”</p>
<p>“Eh, solo? And here I thought I could work with Zeid. &#8230;&#8230;”</p>


<p>Sheila makes her eyes dotted.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>



<p>“Umu, Quena will be asked to carry out a request in the same place, but Sheila will be asked to take on a different request. &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>&#8220;Wh,why! Why Quena!&#8221;</p>
<p>“Fufuhn, I wonder why&#8221;</p>


<p>Sheila is so frustrated.</p>
<p>Seeing such figure, Quena also has an insanely triumphant smile.</p>
<p><em>What kind of conflict is this?</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“No! I&#8217;m switching places with Quena! I want to be in the same place as Zeid!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Even so, Sheila is a knight type that is rare in the guild &#8230;&#8230; No. You are the right person to take on this request.”</p>
<p>“No~I~don’t~want~to”</p>
<p>“Muh”</p>


<p>Riff is having a hard time with Sheila, who is being a bit of a spoiled brat.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>However, it seems that she came up with a good idea.</p>


<p>“If you complete this request in a proper manner, you will likely have more time with Zeid in the future.”</p>
<p>“What was that!? I&#8217;d love to take it! Give me the contents immediately!”</p>
<p>“She’s simple, right”</p>
<p>“She’s easy and convenient to handle.”</p>


<p>Finally, the explanation of the request began.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>There are two requests.</p>
<p>One was directed at me and Quena.</p>


<p>The one is called 『Securing a book that exists in the deepest part of the underground dungeon in the kingdom』. I asked her if it would be better to accept the request as a party, but she said, &#8220;No, the request includes the condition that you must complete it alone,&#8221; so I would have to go to the deepest part of the underground separately from Quena.</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t even ask her why I had to be alone.</p>
<p>She told me that we would be sleeping in the underground dungeon and that we should be prepared. However, I could spend a year without anything, so it&#8217;s no problem for me. <em>I don&#8217;t care about cleanliness or filth as long as I can bathe in water.</em></p>
<p>The other is Sheila&#8217;s. It is also a request that requires battle, but the lineage is different; it appears that she will be a female escort for the newly appointed prime minister of the kingdom.</p>
<p>I felt that something was wrong, especially the fact that the three of us were called all together, despite the fact that we will all have separate requests.</p>
<p>Well, however, even if I feel uncomfortable, there is no reason not to accept the request.</p>
<p>Three days after hearing about the request, I arrived at the forest where the underground dungeon I was requested to visit was located.</p>
<p>Dozens of strong-looking men and women had already arrived in the forest.</p>
<p>It was said that they are competent adventurers gathered from all over the country. Me and Quena are from the Royal Capital. The others come from the Empire, Republic, and others countries</p>
<p>Among them was a man dressed in a robe.</p>
<p>Riff told me about it. She said that a man who is the 『requestor』 is there. So he must be the one.</p>


<p>“The time has come. Let me explain the details of the request.”</p>


<p>Everyone listened to the man&#8217;s words in unison.</p>
<p>The details of the request were as Riff had told me beforehand. <em>I guess it become more detailed, huh.</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>The underground dungeon we will be going to go through now is said to be a long and deep cave whose total length is not yet fully grasped. It has its unique ecosystem, and it seems that new species of Earth dragons have been discovered in its depths.</p>
<p><em>I wonder what is in the deepest part of such a dungeon.</em></p>
<p>According to the lore, there is a 『magic book』, that is a relic in which the Demon King, who particularly excelled at magic in successive generations, wrote down everything about himself before his death.</p>
<p>The authenticity seemed to be quite high, and the appearance and color of the book were also described verbally.</p>
<p>And when the request is fulfilled, everyone was told that they will be paid a 『minimum guarantee amount』 as a reward. Of course, more than double the amount of money will be given to those who fulfill the request.</p>
<p>I wondered if this would cause some of the people to slack off, but for some reason, the people around me were fully motivated.</p>
<p>Quena next to me was also enthusiastically listening to the client&#8217;s explanation.</p>
<p>After the explanation, the requester said, &#8220;Well then, please do your best.”.</p>
<p>That would mean the start of the request.</p>
<p>Now then, there seems to be something behind this request. Just as I was about to ask Quena, who has a mysterious look on her face, about the situation &#8230;&#8230;.</p>


<p>“Oy! You!”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>


<p>A thorny voice called out to me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>I turned around to see the owner of the voice and saw a legitimately handsome man with blond hair and blue eyes. He was looking at me with an obviously hostile look in his eyes.</p>


<p>“I&#8217;ve heard rumors about you! Zeid, the guy who skipped a class and got an S rank.”</p>
<p>“Ah. That must be me. What&#8217;s wrong?”</p>
<p>“You know me, don’t you. I called on you because you would probably be my rival in this request. I won&#8217;t lose to you!”</p>


<p><em>You know me, you say……</em></p>
<p><em>Fumu……</em></p>
<p><em>I have never meet him at all, though. I haven&#8217;t heard anything about his outward appearance, or even rumors in regards to him. </em></p>
<p>I must have looked at him with a puzzled look on my face.</p>
<p>The young man&#8217;s cheeks twitched.</p>


<p>“Do,don&#8217;t tell me you don&#8217;t know me!?”</p>
<p>“Sorry”</p>
<p>“Do,do,do…… don’t fuck with me! I&#8217;m Weeg Stillbeats! You&#8217;ve at least heard that name, right!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“……Fumu?”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t give me that 『never heard of it at all』 look! Aren’t you too ignorant!?”</p>


<p>The energetic young man continues.</p>


<p>“I&#8217;m the first prince of the Kingdom of Stillbeats, Weeg of 『Flash Cut』, who became an A-rank adventurer at the age of eighteen! Remember that!”</p>
<p>“Ah, nice to meet you. I&#8217;m Zeid “</p>


<p>So that’s it.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know much about his circumstances, but he must be a great guy anyway.</p>
<p><em>Sorry, I am still learning about the continent.</em></p>


<p>“No, your reaction’s too light! Oh, forget it! I&#8217;m going to the deepest part first! You&#8217;re ranked higher than me, but I&#8217;ll show you who&#8217;s really good and who&#8217;s loved by the Goddess!”</p>


<p>While saying that, Weeg ran toward the deepest part of the underground dungeon.</p>

<p>Well then, I can finally ask Quena the main question.</p>
<p>When I turned around to look at Quena, she had somehow turned her heel and was about to head home.</p>


<p>“Ah. Oy, Quena. You know what the real purpose of this request is, don&#8217;t you? Can you tell it to me.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a long story. Besides, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s something Zeid would be interested in.”</p>


<p>That&#8217;s a very meaningful statement.</p>
<p>Her expression also looks as if she is thinking about something.</p>


<p>“You’re going back?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I can&#8217;t beat Zeid with this request anyway. ……then I&#8217;d have to go through with another request.”</p>


<p>The latter part seemed to be her blurting it out to herself.</p>
<p>She didn&#8217;t say anything more.</p>
<p><em>She can’t win huh.</em></p>
<p>Well, that’s a calm analysis.</p>


<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/089_1_.jpg"></img>

<p>I had already figured out the deepest part with my detection magic.</p>
<p>This underground dungeon is quite deep. It will take more than three days to conquer it because of the intricate places and monsters.</p>
<p>If I ignore the terrain and break its walls and floors to build passageways, it may take half a day.</p>
<p>However,</p>


<p>“Transfer”</p>


<p>With this magic, which few people use, it only took me a moment.</p>
<p>Even if I can&#8217;t see it, as long as I can use detection magic to check the situation and condition of the transfer destination, I can go anywhere.</p>
<p>And then I arrived —— in a dimly lit room.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>There’s a magic item in the shape of a torch, which contains an enormous amount of magic power. Its shape is similar to the real thing and the way the flame comes out is also the same.</p>
<p>However, the key point is that it is a magic item.</p>
<p>This is essentially different from an existing torch, this magic item will continue to burn even if you put it in water.</p>
<p>Moreover, over a long period of time, as long as it has a fuel which is magic power, it can continually produce light. The fact that it is still burning in this room, which has probably been unoccupied for a long time, should be proof of that.</p>
<p>Well, better than such a magic item. There was the book he was looking for.</p>
<p>It was enshrined at what looked like an altar, emitting an ominous black aura.</p>


<p>“Is that it”</p>


<p>I pick it up.</p>
<p>It is not heavy, but it is not light either.</p>
<p>The number of its pages would be about the size of one middle finger.</p>
<p>It has no fancy decorations.</p>
<p>The book has a black exterior with small, difficult-looking white letters on the cover.</p>
<p><em>I guess that completes the request for now.</em></p>
<p>That’s what I thought.</p>
<p>——At that moment. I noticed that a number of magic circles were deployed around the ritual, where the book had been displayed, filling it.</p>
<p>It is so much so that my constantly activated detection magic could sense enough magic power to shake the underground dungeon.</p>
<p>Letters emerge on the altar.</p>


<p>『Let those who desire power be put to the final test. 』</p>


<p>Few will understand this just by looking at it.</p>
<p>However, I was clearly aware of it as I was deploying my detection magic. ——The number of monsters in the entire underground dungeon is increasing at an abnormal rate.</p>


<p>“I was surprised. I didn&#8217;t notice that at all.”</p>


<p>I said what I was thinking.</p>
<p>Ordinarily, magic power, however weak it is, passes through such installed magic formulas. Its principle is similar to that of magic items. However, this did not have any magic power passing through it, or even any residual of it floating.</p>
<p>Perhaps it has never been used.</p>
<p><em>No one has ever been to this deepest part —— to test whether this magic formula would really succeed.</em></p>
<p>It’s a sign of overwhelming confidence. A sign of competence, huh. They must have been powerful enough to do that. The <em>Demon King</em> who wrote this book.</p>
<p><em>For the time being.</em></p>
<p>I froze the magic formula which was at its starting point.</p>
<p>However, that doesn’t stop the magic formula that has already been activated.</p>


<p>“Transfer”</p>


<p>The number of monsters continues to increase.</p>
<p>If this continues as it is, it will be impossible for me to distinguish between the adventurers in the underground dungeon and the monsters. So before that happens,</p>


<p>“Woah, who are you! No. Rather than that, leave this place quickly! It’s getting dangerous somehow!”</p>
<p>“Yes, transfer.”</p>


<p>It&#8217;s the first one.</p>
<p>I bring a man in his thirties or so with a huge axe back to aboveground.</p>
<p>I stayed in the dungeon myself.</p>
<p>On to the next.</p>


<p>“Nuoh! I thought it was a new monster&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Transfer”</p>


<p>Third one.</p>
<p>The fourth.</p>
<p>The fifth person.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t counted since I was over twenty.</p>
<p>However, it came to the point where there was only one left.</p>
<p>It’s at the lower levels of the dungeon which are already filled with monsters.</p>
<p>My transfer was to a handsome blonde man.</p>
<p><em>I wonder who it is. It must have been some amazing person.</em></p>
<p>There he was.</p>


<p>“Ze,Zeid! What are you doing! It&#8217;s going to be pretty bad, so you&#8217;d better get out of here!”</p>
<p>“Transfer”</p>
<p>“Nuo”</p>


<p>This is the last one.</p>
<p>This is all of them.</p>
<p>The only ones left are the huge number of monsters and me in this underground dungeon.</p>
<p>I concentrate my magic power at my feet.</p>
<p>—— In the Forbidden Forest Depths where I used to live, there was a monster that manipulated ice and snow.</p>
<p>Even the monsters that were supposed to become my food were frozen and made to suffer for it.</p>
<p>But now the magic of that monster is——.</p>


<p>“Second style—— 【Cold Prison】”</p>


<p>——Something that I can use too.</p>


<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/092_1_.jpg"></img>

<p>Starting around me, the ground froze with a <em>pishi pishi </em>sound. <em>I guess the freezing speed is about that of a dog or cat running at full speed.</em></p>
<p>In this intricate underground dungeon, the ice crawls as if it was alive.</p>
<p>Powerful monsters have emerged. The lower one goes, the higher the rank. There are probably double digits of monsters with S rank.</p>
<p>It is not possible to exterminate all of them.</p>
<p>This is a dungeon, after all.</p>
<p>It can’t be helped if all the treasures in the underground would be taken, but without even monsters, its value would be lost. <em>There are even people who make a living just by defeating monsters.</em></p>


<p>“Okay, that&#8217;s about it.”</p>


<p>I have finished most of the process.</p>
<p>It froze the activated magic formula, making it malfunction, and turned 90% of the monsters that was born into ice statues.</p>
<p>I remove the magic power supply to the magic that has been spread throughout the dungeon.</p>
<p>There is a sound like glass shattering, and everything frozen in place vanishes like dust.</p>
<p><em>With this, I&#8217;ve wiped my own ass.</em></p>


<p>“Transfer”</p>


<p>This time I&#8217;m going to transfer myself out of this dungeon.</p>
<p>I came back in the forest which doesn’t change for the better.</p>
<p>The reactions of those around me were divided into those who were stunned, those who were impatient, and those who did not try to hide their astonishment when they noticed my appearance.</p>
<p>And then there is the client who have a somewhat hateful look on his face.</p>


<p>“Here. This is the book you requested.”</p>


<p>I hand him the request form at the same time as the book.</p>
<p>The client verified the request and the book.</p>


<p>“Zeid, fuhn……. Ah. I certainly receive it. This is the money for the accomplishment of my request.”</p>


<p>He roughly takes the book I hand him and throws a burlap sack full of money in my direction.</p>


<p>“What about the documents required to prove that the request has been fulfilled?”</p>
<p>“I will pass such a thing on my side. Get lost”</p>
<p>“Is that right”</p>


<p><em>Did I do something?</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t deserve this kind of attitude.</p>
<p>I open the burlap sack to check the request achievement money.</p>


<p>“Tsk. Oy, what are you opening it for”</p>


<p>The tone of his voice was very rough, a complete change from the beginning.</p>


<p>“I was just trying to make sure, though.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have trust in me!?”</p>
<p>“I do trust you because it was done through the guild. But I&#8217;ve been taught by the guild that it&#8217;s part of the procedure to check it.”</p>


<p>When I opened to see the inside, there were gold coins in it.</p>
<p><em>I count each piece. &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>
<p>It’s not enough.</p>
<p>It is also ten sheets short. Much less than the amount that was planned.</p>


<p>“This is not enough, though?”</p>


<p>Clearly, this is not within the margin of error.</p>


<p>“Ah? I&#8217;m sure it was enough when I checked it. You must’ve stolen it”</p>


<p>No, no, no.</p>


<p>“I just received it, so there&#8217;s no way I could steal it in a snap.”</p>


<p>In fact, case like this also happens.</p>
<p>That is why the guild may act as an intermediary and receive the commission accomplishment money ahead of time.</p>
<p>However, as an exception, those who are trustworthy —— for example, those who have made ten or more requests through a guild or organization —— may give gold coins directly to the adventurers. They can also say that the guild intermediation fee will be paid on another day.</p>
<p>It is used in cases such as this one, where there are many nominations, or where there is no time to go directly to the guild and deposit money.</p>


<p>“Hey, look here! I&#8217;m a priest of the 『Hero Association』!? We have no money to give to people we don&#8217;t even know where they come from! Normally, this request should be accepted by a person of high rank and clear origin! Do you really think you can pass the test like this!!”</p>


<p>The requestor yells at me.</p>
<p>Hero Association. Priest. High-ranked person. Test.</p>
<p>I got many unfamiliar words. If Quena were here, she would have been able to put the story together, but she had already left without even accepting the request money.</p>


<p>“In the first place! This request should have taken more than three days! You must have been cheating from the very beginning, checking for loopholes or something beforehand!? I don’t intend to give it to such a coward. &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>&#8220;Let it end there, Byrias Madden.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, Weeg-sama!”</p>


<p>At that time. This is where Weeg came in between me and the requestor. That’s right, this guy is a prince from a country called Stillbeats Kingdom or something like that. He’s one of those whom Byrias calls a high ranking person.</p>


<p>“It didn&#8217;t look to me like Zeid had done anything wrong. Both for the dungeon traversal and receiving the reward. Any more than that would tarnish your reputation and the reputation of the Hero Association.”</p>


<p>Ah.</p>
<p>This one too has changed from the first time we met, with a more elegant tone.</p>
<p>Why didn’t he have this from the beginning? <em>I wonder which one is the real thing.</em></p>
<p>Either way, well said, my man.</p>
<p>Well, there are many, many things that spring to my attention, but the requestor, Byrias, put out another burlap sack from his pocket.</p>


<p>“……Pardon me. Come to think of it, here&#8217;s also the amount of money for the accomplishment.”</p>


<p>Perhaps when it was discovered that I was the last one left in the dungeon, he pulled out the gold coins from the burlap sack which he would give to those who accomplish the request.</p>
<p>So much so that he was not convinced that I would accomplish this request.</p>
<p>Well, if it ended satisfactorily, let&#8217;s not poke at the details.</p>


<p>“Thank you very much. And Weeg, thank you as well.”</p>
<p>“O,oh! As expected of the man that the 【Saint of the Light Star】 Soria recognized&#8230;&#8230; my rival!”</p>


<p>He said, somewhat in high spirits.</p>
<p>I wondered what a rival was, but well, I got the general idea of what they were talking about.</p>
<p>Frankly, though, I&#8217;m not interested.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s go back.</p>

<p>“Transfer”</p>



<p>After making several transitions today, I returned to the inn where I was staying.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>2: The Nature of the Request</strong></p>

︎
<p>It's been some time since I accomplished the request to search for a magic book.</p>
<p>I was called to the guild master’s room, telling me that she had another request for me.</p>
<p>It seemed that Quena and Sheila were also called at the same time as me.</p>


<p>“Zeid and Sheila cleared it on their first try. Quena also cleared it the second time huh. Well, some of you may not be aware of it, but this is actually what happened in the previous nomination request she received.”</p>


<p>As she said this, Riff put three request forms on the desk.</p>
<p>Each of us receives it.</p>
<p>This time, it was not the client, but the 『Hero Association』 written proudly in the client request organization column.</p>


<p>“Well, I guess so.”</p>


<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>I looked at the request with Quena next to me who has a tone that she knew about it.</p>
<p>I had a faint hunch, too, but Sheila had a 『?』 mark on her head.</p>


<p>“Zeid, Quena, and Sheila. The three of you were officially selected to represent the guild headquarters in the Kingdom of Kuzera as candidates for the next Hero party. Zeid and Quena have the aptitude of a hero, and Sheila has the knight’s.”</p>
<p>““Oh””</p>


<p>Sheila and my voice are in tune.</p>
<p>Hero Party.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve at least heard stories about it. It is said that they used to be the representative of the human race who fought against the Demon King. It was said that even now where the conflict with the demonic race has subsided, they are still being gathered from each country as the hopes of the human race.</p>
<p>However, a question came to my mind.</p>


<p>“Isn&#8217;t it said that a hero is chosen by the Goddess’ oracle?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Ah, I guess Zeid was not familiar with it. There are several ways to choose a hero.”</p>


<p>Riff explained.</p>
<p>The first is when you are chosen by an oracle from a Goddess like I said.</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>However, there was a precondition for this: the oracle would only be given if the Demon King was born with aggressive goals such as &#8220;continental domination&#8221; on the demon tribe side.</p>
<p>She says that skirmishes still occur, but it’s not enough to start a war, so that’s not possible.</p>
<p>The second is when, as in this case, an organization called the Hero Association selects the members of the hero party.</p>
<p>It was said that they will recruit from various organizations such as guilds, knights, and mercenary units.</p>
<p>The selection criteria are kept confidential by the association.</p>
<p>I hear that it is an honor just to be chosen by the association, even if not by the goddess in her original form, and those heroes have become the objects of admiration and the hope of the human race.</p>
<p>As for how the representatives of each organization are decided, for example, in the guild, it seems that they will be asked to carry out difficult requests, and the candidates are chosen in order of their success.</p>
<p>This is the first for me and Sheila, and second for Quena, which is the number of times we&#8217;ve successfully completed a request. Everyone has good records.</p>
<p>What about Weeg, which wasn’t called out because he was from a guild in another country?</p>


<p>“But, in the end, if the Goddess didn&#8217;t choose it, doesn&#8217;t that mean that it&#8217;s a fake?”</p>
<p>“Umuh, It’s not official. Even so, those who have the greatest strength and heart are chosen, and so, they are celebrated as heroes among the human race. There are many oppositions that say it’s disrespectful, though”</p>
<p>“So it&#8217;s just a decoration to boost the economy, huh.”</p>
<p>“That’s why I’m saying it’s dull. In fact, it&#8217;s only the human race that gets excited, and as they are not chosen by the goddess, they don&#8217;t have any special support from the other races.”</p>
<p>“If you are chosen by the Goddess, you can get help from the other races?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>“Since some races have been saved by the Hero’s Party.”</p>
<p>“Heh. I see.”</p>


<p>So in the end, it&#8217;s only an imposter.</p>
<p>However, it was said that being chosen as a hero, would increase your popularity and interest within the human race.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why they don&#8217;t tell anyone when they get a request to select a hero candidate.</p>
<p>Since sometimes they get nervous and can&#8217;t exert their bare strength.</p>
<p>Still, Quena and Weeg seemed to have caught on at it.</p>


<p>“Therefore, it&#8217;s up to you whether or not you accept this request. The same as before, you will get the minimum amount of money even if you don&#8217;t complete it. But accomplishing this would be a step forward as a candidate for the Hero party of all the guilds.”</p>


<p>Candidate for the Hero party of all guilds.</p>
<p>In here, it only means that they can be listed as candidates for the hero party of each organization.</p>
<p>In other words, perhaps the next time around, they would be one of the official party members recognized by the Hero Association.</p>

<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>“Ah, just so you know, if you don&#8217;t get this request, it won&#8217;t cost you any points, alright”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Seriously”</p>
<p>“Umu. There are many people who don&#8217;t want to stand out badly or who say that it&#8217;s annoying. Especially if they reach the S rank, they are well known and have secured their positions. They don&#8217;t need to have the title of a Hero. In fact, only the A ranks have been selected as a hero candidate from the guild. &#8221;</p>


<p>Heh, I see.</p>
<p>When I received that request, I had the impression that strong adventurers were gathering. Of course, Quena is also very talented. <em>Since at the time she was surrounded by multiple wyverns, she was able to take down quite a few of them without a single scratch.</em></p>
<p><em>How about the other S-ranks?</em></p>
<p>I met Soria in the Holy Republic, but I didn’t see her ability personally. Still, she was able to quickly heal the wounded, who would have been in large numbers, so she must have had considerable skill, but &#8230;&#8230;yes. That’s only it.</p>


<p>“Did Soria also receive it? We&#8217;re at the Kingdom, and she&#8217;s at the Holy Republic, right? And they used to call her the 【Saint of the Light Star】. &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Ah, Soria has already been appointed as the only saint of the Hero party.”</p>
<p>“She’s not a candidate?”</p>
<p>“Indeed. That&#8217;s because she&#8217;s been famous since she was a child. I heard that the Hero Association bowed down to the Holy Republic and asked them for her help.”</p>


<p>I wondered how it would be since she has &#8220;saint&#8221; in her second name, but I guess it&#8217;s already confirmed. <em>That&#8217;s amazing.</em></p>
<p>That&#8217;s probably why Weeg also mentioned Soria&#8217;s name.</p>


<p>“Since it&#8217;s a request, there&#8217;s no reason to decline——“</p>
<p>“Wait a minute, Zeid.”</p>

<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>When I was about to accept the request, Quena interrupted me from the side.</p>
<p>Quena continues.</p>


<p>“——I&#8217;d like you to turn this request down.”</p>


<p>This request.</p>
<p>In other words, she wants me to turn down one of the tests that would have selected me as a candidate for the hero’s party.</p>
<p>Quena then adds.</p>


<p>“I will give you the money for the request. Of course, it’s the amount when you accomplish it.”</p>
<p>“Hah. The reward for the completion this time is high because it is a request from each guild branch after the decision of the main is made. Is that okay?”</p>


<p>Riff asks on my behalf.</p>
<p>In fact, the request form actually states a ridiculous amount of money.</p>
<p>But Quena nodded without hesitation.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>



<p>“I have that much. And what I&#8217;ve been working hard until now&#8230;&#8230; it is no exaggeration to say that this is the reason.”</p>
<p>“Ah, then that’s okay”</p>
<p>“What do you guys mean?”</p>


<p>I interjected a pause of doubt into the conversation that goes on between just the two of them.</p>
<p>However, Quena turned away.</p>


<p>“I don&#8217;t think Zeid and Sheila are the kinds of person who would flaunt their personalities rashly. It would be easier to get them to say no if you explained it to them.”</p>
<p>“……That’s true”</p>


<p>Quena rechecks the request form.</p>
<p>The content of the request.</p>
<p>In the center of the 『Forbidden Forest Depths』, a huge forest in an S-rank designated area. There is a healing lake there, a place filled with healing water that can cure any wound or illness.</p>
<p>To secure and bring that water. That was the request.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>It’s the same as the first request. I can use detection magic and transfer, so I have the most advantage for this request.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Forbidding Forest Depths will be the place, which is where I lived from my childhood to my boyhood. I also know the place called the healing lake.</p>
<p>My win is almost certain.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why, Quena suggested that I decline the request.</p>
<p>Quena&#8217;s lips, that trembled, looking as if she was having difficulty saying something —— opened.</p>


<p>“Believe it or not, I am the emperor of the Weila Empire’s &#8230;&#8230; daughter.”</p>
<p>“Waoh!”</p>


<p>Sheila shows an overt surprised face.</p>
<p>&#8230;&#8230;Ah, come to think of it, about the news that came out of the Adventurer&#8217;s Card. I saw an article about the newly appointed Empress and thought that she and Quena looked so much alike, but they were really family, huh.</p>


<p>“……Your reaction is weaker than I expected.”</p>
<p>“No, no! I’m surprised!”</p>

<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Sheila leaves a straightforward thought.</p>
<p>I just couldn&#8217;t react much like Sheila.</p>
<p>To be honest, I don&#8217;t understand the greatness of being called the emperor&#8217;s daughter. No, I should say that I know how great it is, but I can&#8217;t really feel it.</p>
<p><em>I guess this also the adverse effect of living in a remote countryside.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“But, but, did such an important person come to be in the kingdom? And even though you’re an adventurer, you’re not even talked about, right?”</p>


<p>Sheila asked.</p>


<p>“I was a child of a concube. What&#8217;s more, from just a prostitute. It&#8217;s almost like I never existed to them, and all along they made fun of me for being a concubine&#8217;s child.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I see. That’s why you look alike.”</p>
<p>“Indeed. If I become an S-rank or even a man, I can break the noses of those who made fun of me and my mother. That&#8217;s why, I left that suffocating castle.”</p>


<p>Quena&#8217;s fists are clenched tightly.</p>
<p>She must have been frustrated.</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>



<p>“Well, if that&#8217;s the case, then I&#8217;m not interested in being a hero. If I don&#8217;t excuse myself here, I&#8217;ll achieve it after being second. That&#8217;s good enough, right?”</p>


<p>This request does not mean that only the first achiever will receive an increased reward.</p>
<p>All the participants will be paid the same amount of money for their success.</p>
<p>It would be a tribute to those who have cleared the selection so far.</p>


<p>“……Thank you. I’m sorry”</p>


<p>Quena put more strength into her clenched fist. Even harder.</p>
<p>Even for her, it must have been a request she was unwilling to make. Her humiliation must have outweighed her gratitude to me.</p>
<p>Even if it&#8217;s frustrating, I think she wants to triumph more than that.</p>
<p><em>The environment in which one was born has that much to do with one’s life.</em></p>


<p>“Eh. I was taking the request because I wanted to have a party with Zeid. &#8230;&#8230;”</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>



<p>Pouting, Sheila swelled her cheeks and complained.</p>


<p>“By &#8220;party,&#8221; do you mean a &#8220;Hero Party”?”</p>
<p>“No, a normal one. Or rather, anything with Zeid.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s straight &#8230;&#8230;but you could at least have a party together.”</p>
<p>“Ugh. I&#8217;ve said before that I&#8217;d like to join with him too, but &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>&#8220;The pace at which I receive requests, and the time it takes to accomplish them, has not been a problem for me so far. I&#8217;m not thinking about a party.”</p>
<p>“That seems to be so……”</p>


<p>Her discouragement is stark and blatant.</p>


<p>“Well, if I get a request that requires a party or something, I’ll just ask you.”</p>
<p>“Really!? I&#8217;m looking forward to it!?”</p>

<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Sheila brings her face so close to me that I can feel her breath.</p>
<p>Her nice smell tickles my nose.</p>


<p>“So Sheila will not accept the request, is that correct?”</p>
<p>“Yes, if I can&#8217;t have a party with Zeid, I’ll pass.”</p>
<p>“I understand. To be honest, there are not many people in the guild who are qualified to be knights. I think that Sheila, who is C-rank but still as good as an A-rank in terms of ability, would be a good candidate for the hero party, though?”</p>
<p>“I can see that. But I&#8217;m not going to accept the request.”</p>


<p>Lightly, Riff tried to persuade her, but she was crushed to pieces.</p>
<p>Sheila&#8217;s resolve seems unwavering.</p>


<p>“Fumu. Since you can be a candidate for the Hero party, you should be more like, 『I want to do it! 』 &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I&#8217;m not interested.”</p>


<p>Quena says apologetically at Sheila&#8217;s appearance.</p>


<p>“The amount of money for the request, I’ll give it to you”</p>
<p>“Eh, why?”</p>
<p>“Because &#8230;&#8230; the truth is that Sheila also abandoned her request for me. So if I don&#8217;t make up the difference, I&#8217;m as good as lost.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>


<p>Sheila scratches her cheek with a wry smile on her face.</p>
<p>She looks like she is in trouble.</p>


<p>“Quena, that&#8217;s not the case. Aren&#8217;t you being a little worked up?”</p>
<p>“……What do you mean by that”</p>


<p>Harsh words were returned to her.</p>
<p>Then, Quena, perhaps in a huff, closed her eyelids tightly and said,</p>


<p>“I’m sorry”</p>


<p>With that, she left the room.</p>
<p>A bad air flows through the atmosphere.</p>


<p>“Excuse her. She has been fighting alone for a long time. I guess she doesn&#8217;t want to miss out on a great opportunity. Forgive her.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I understand. Far from forgiving her, I was constantly being saved by her when I came to the guild. Now it&#8217;s my turn to pay her back.”</p>


<p>It was Quena I was talking about.</p>
<p>She said that it was just something she did because she had lost our match.</p>
<p>But it’s different, according to my interpretation.</p>
<p>She took the time to take care of me, even though she had so many goals that she was so desperately trying to achieve.</p>
<p>I want to return the favor in proportion to that.</p>


<p>“Well. I guess I&#8217;ll accept the request.”</p>


<p>I take the request form given to me by Riff.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>I arrived at the Forbidden Forest Depth, which was quite nostalgic.</p>
<p>I wonder how long has it been. I haven’t come here in the last few years.</p>
<p>There is no sign of a mighty monster in the place facing the outer part of the forest.</p>
<p>However, as you go deeper in, monsters with a different kind of strength have been sighted with detection magic.</p>
<p>The most common ones are herds of Fenrirs and a pitch black, panther-like, intelligent and ferocious monster called an Arg, which uses dark-system magic. Many other monsters classified as S-rank also inhabit the area.</p>
<p>At the entrance to such a place, there was the client glaring at me. He&#8217;s a priest who belongs to the Hero Association.</p>
<p>The man quickly turned away and explained the 『Request Details』 to the adventurers, whose number is about between ten and twenty.</p>


<p>“The 『Healing Water』 must be secured from the 『Healing Lake』 which is said to exist in this 『Forbidden Forest Depths』. That is the test!”</p>


<p>The request was rephrased as a test.</p>
<p>From his point of view, he is here as an examiner, not as a client.</p>


<p>“As you all know, this will be the final test. Since it&#8217;s called a request to elect the representative from the guild, if you complete it, the reward will be given. Even if you couldn’t achieve it, some will be distributed to you. But! Only the first one to bring it will be truly chosen as a candidate for the Hero party!”</p>


<p>Gurgling, some of the adventurers cleared their throat.</p>
<p>As it is the final exam, the participants are also quite amazing.</p>
<p>Still, Quena isn’t inferior.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s safe to say that most of them are A rank. There seems to be no S rank other than me. I&#8217;m glad that Quena has a better chance of succeeding with the request to being first.</p>
<p>It’s not that I didn&#8217;t want to see the other S-ranks.</p>


<p>“Then let&#8217;s begin the final test!”</p>


<p>The examiner gave the signal to start.</p>
<p>The adventurers started running at once. Quena is also going at a vigorous pace.</p>


<p>“Oy! Zeid!”</p>


<p>One person in the crowd of running adventurers called out to me, while looking at my way. It was Weeg.</p>


<p>“You are my rival! Although you were ahead of me in the first exam, it is this Weeg who is destined to become the Her—— <em>bugeh</em>!?”</p>


<p>Weeg hits a tree. It went directly to his face.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s what would happen if you looked at me without looking ahead. <em>It isn’t a good sign</em>.</p>


<p>“Transfer”</p>


<p>I don&#8217;t intend to be the first to accomplish this.</p>
<p>But, well, it wouldn&#8217;t hurt to collect the healing water first.</p>
<p>——A nostalgic scene spread out before me.</p>
<p>The sun&#8217;s rays pass through the trees, illuminating the large, clear lake.</p>
<p>Bright green mosses grew on the rocks surrounding it.</p>
<p>The surface of the lake is elevated so that the clean water overflows from the center of the lake.</p>
<p>The water that is constantly being produced is being drunk and quenched by the usually boisterous monster without fighting.</p>
<p>It’s a mystical sight, you might say.</p>
<p>I took out a bottle I had prepared beforehand and had them shared the healing water.</p>


<p>『Ah, a’re, nu, nu, nu, nu, Milord!? 』</p>


<p>Like so.</p>
<p>Some kind of telepathy echoes in my brain.</p>
<p>It was something that the monsters in the surrounding area had told me.</p>
<p>All of them are looking at me with a frightened look.</p>


<p>『Nu, the Lord has returned. &#8230;&#8230;! 』</p>
<p>『Tell the herd! Tell the herd to run wherever they are before they get eaten! 』</p>
<p>『Hieee……! The calamity of this forest has returned……! 』</p>


<p><em>I wonder. What are these terrible things they are saying?</em></p>
<p>At the time I grew accustomed to it, I ate a variety of monsters as an omnivore, though. <em>It&#8217;s been quite a while now, but these monsters were still talking about me this way.</em></p>
<p>Even so…… I&#8217;m not sure I&#8217;d like to see a single monster disappear from the lake. &#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>It was a nice view, but it has a deserted scene that made me feel lonely.</p>
<p>However, while deploying detection magic, I start to really think about it.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if any adventurers can make it this far.</em></p>
<p>This is a forest with an S-rank designation.</p>
<p>But not as a whole. The area just a few steps in, is full of monsters that wouldn’t kill a person even if they were a C-rank.</p>
<p>Even so, when one goes inside, one will find that the place is crawling with monsters of A rank or higher.</p>
<p>If you ask me if an adventurer who is not even S rank can overcome that&#8230;&#8230; it would be hard to give a positive opinion.</p>
<p>However, when it comes to Quena, I think she will reach it because she has the ability and experience.</p>
<p>I immediately felt the presence of the dropouts with detection magic.</p>
<p><em>Well, there may have been a few successes at best, and maybe one at worst.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p><em>Pshew, </em>the blood of the monster that touched my flaming sword evaporates.</p>
<p>Countless dead Argu were lying before my eyes.</p>


<p>“Fuh…… I guess that’s the end of it”</p>


<p>I was unintentionally dazzled by this sense of accomplishment.</p>
<p>According to the information I had obtained in advance from the guild-operated library, I would soon be at the healing lake.</p>
<p><em>Ah…… there it was.</em></p>
<p>The scene is as beautiful as the rumors say.</p>
<p>But along with the lake —— there was also a tall, thin man with dark hair and dark eyes.</p>
<p>Zeid.</p>
<p>He is a monster, a former member of the Royal Chivalric order, who has suddenly risen to S rank.</p>
<p>He is aloof from the world and out of it a lot, yet he thinks with a somewhat firm perspective on things. &#8230;&#8230; I don&#8217;t really understand that guy.</p>
<p>Even now, he has arrived to the lake before anyone else.</p>


<p>“Yo, Good work.”</p>


<p>Zeid calls out to me in a lighthearted manner.</p>
<p>He seemed to take no notice of my frustration, which I had unintentionally ventured into him at the Guildmaster&#8217;s office.</p>


<p>“You’re fast”</p>


<p>I take out the special bottle distributed by the client and scoop up the water.</p>


<p>“Ah. That’s because I used transfer”</p>
<p>“……——tu”</p>


<p>Zeid&#8217;s words hurt my heart.</p>
<p>He should have been the candidate for the Hero to be elected from the guild. It is clear in terms of ability.</p>
<p>He could have given the bottle to the examiner and passed the test before I got here.</p>
<p>There aren&#8217;t many S ranks I&#8217;ve seen.</p>
<p>But his skills are probably the best in the guild. I am convinced that he will surpass even Riff, who is renowned for her excellence.</p>
<p>【Saint of the Light Star】 Soria Aiden would think that Zeid is more qualified to be a hero than I am.</p>
<p>No, he’s not. He is the right man for the title by all accounts.</p>
<p>The event from a while ago.</p>
<p>She was the one who destroyed the Order for the sake of just one girl.</p>
<p>That was exactly what I would call a hero. Since he stood up to a mighty organization for justice.</p>
<p><em>&#8230;&#8230; Well, there’s also the backstory that he himself is strong enough to surpass such mighty organization, though.</em></p>
<p><em>Gusha, gusha, </em>then I wash my face in the water of the lake.</p>
<p>I was able to get rid of all of my fatigue by just doing it. <em>As one may expect of this, which is something that can be traded for dozens of gold coins for just a single bottle.</em></p>


<p>“Uhhm. At the time we were in the Guild Master’s room…… I’m sorry”</p>
<p>“Hmm, it’s okay. It was nothing in particular.”</p>


<p>I guess he really doesn&#8217;t care about that.</p>
<p>But, for me, it was something I didn&#8217;t want to put off too much.</p>
<p>Since I …… don’t hate him.</p>
<p>When I challenged him to a match, he went along with it, and he was out of the loop in so many ways that I couldn&#8217;t leave him alone, and on the other hand, if he left me alone, I would get angry.</p>
<p>The stupid Riff calls it motherhood or infatuation, but it&#8217;s definitely not.</p>
<p>But I guess this is just &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. what. Yeah. I don&#8217;t know what it is, but I can&#8217;t leave him alone. That&#8217;s all.</p>
<p>Hence, I don&#8217;t dislike him.</p>


<p>“Come on, you&#8217;re halfway there. Good luck.”</p>


<p>I was annoyed by his generous words, though.</p>


<p>“I understand, you know!”</p>


<p>I brusquely returned to him.</p>
<p>I wanted to slap his smirking face, but I decided to save my strength for that.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>Over a dozen hours have passed since the start of the request / test.</p>
<p>There were more than 10 withdrawals/decliners.</p>
<p>However, there was an adventurer who would likely come out of the forest here.</p>
<p>Quena.</p>
<p>She is currently an A-rank adventurer, which is considered close to S-rank. She has bright red hair and eyes that could be mistaken for flames.</p>
<p>She’s almost there. She knew the way she had come, and she could see her goal.</p>
<p>But she felt a presence. And a voice.</p>


<p>“Ple,please help me……!”</p>


<p>It was a voice squeezing for help.</p>
<p>When Quena turned towards the voice, she found a deeply wounded adventurer lying on the ground.</p>


<p>“You okay?”</p>


<p>Quena calls out.</p>
<p>He was also a well-known adventurer.</p>


<p>“I&#8217;m sorry, I can&#8217;t move my legs. I managed to get back to this point, but it looks like it&#8217;s no good &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“Hang on. You&#8217;re almost there.”</p>


<p>Quena visually checks the man&#8217;s injuries. He had lacerations from his chest to his abdomen. And a large amount of blood was pouring out of his chest and abdomen. There are no noticeable wounds on his legs. His leg is immobile due to the excessive bleeding.</p>
<p><em>This will adventurer die.</em></p>
<p>Quena made a split-second judgement.</p>


<p>“Why did you do this absurd thing?”</p>


<p>There’s no blaming there, Quena just asks genuinely.</p>


<p>“I, I was so excited to think that I might become a Hero. &#8230;&#8230; haha.”</p>


<p>The man mocks himself that he was pathetic.</p>
<p>A hero. That&#8217;s what every human beings longs for to become at least once. If you can become that, it would be no wonder that you are willing to bet a life or two.</p>
<p>But adventurers are different. Especially high ranking adventurers who have reached A rank.</p>
<p>They immediately assesses their own circumstances, environment, and situation to ensure that they will never die and that they will not be deeply wounded. That is an adventurer.</p>
<p><em>You pay for your mistakes.</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s natural for him to be ridiculed. Because it’s the profession he chose.</p>
<p>So even if Quena abandons him, no one has any right to talk about her behind her back. Rather, if she doesn&#8217;t leave him behind and try to return with him, she will end up with a word of being foolish.</p>
<p>Quena has several healing items, but there’s only one item that could stave off his death.</p>
<p><em>It’s only the item &#8220;Healing Water&#8221; which was the request this time——.</em></p>
<p>Quena is definitely going to be the first. So all she needs to do is to hand that over and she will pass the test. Her road to being a hero is open. Just being a candidate will raise her profile. She can never do something stupid.</p>
<p>She can go back and forth. But the next time, she doesn&#8217;t know if she&#8217;ll make it back alive in one piece. It is the path she managed to take while escaping from powerful monsters.</p>
<p>She could be repeating the same failure as the previous man who was injured.</p>
<p>Though it’s like that.</p>
<p>Nevertheless.</p>


<p>“Drink this”</p>


<p>Quena dribbled the water on the man&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>The sound of his gulping was heard. Then his wound healed quickly and the blood spouting stopped.</p>


<p>“Thi…… this …… is…….”</p>


<p>The man loses consciousness from relief at the sight of his wounds healing. His fatigue must have reached its peak. The thread of his tension must’ve been broken.</p>
<p>Quena confirmed that the man was breathing well.</p>


<p>“Are you with that. Quena”</p>


<p>Suddenly, a man&#8217;s voice comes from behind Quena.</p>
<p>It’s Zeid.</p>


<p>“……I&#8217;m not planning to get the title at the expense of someone else&#8217;s life.”</p>
<p>“Ah, is that so. That’s true”</p>
<p>“What is it, with that way of talking”</p>


<p>Quena lowers one eyebrow at Zeid, who speaks as if he sees right through her.</p>
<p>Zeid searched his pocket and took out the bottle. ——The one that contains the healing water.</p>


<p>“Here”</p>
<p>“Wha. I, I can’t accept that, you know!?”</p>
<p>“Why? You want to be a hero, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s, I want to be…….! But that’s why……!”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t know much about being a hero, but I don&#8217;t want to live in a world that doesn&#8217;t reward people like you who save people without gaining profit or loss.”</p>
<p>“……Tu!”</p>


<p>When Zeid said it so simply, tears almost fell from the corners of Quena&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>With trembling hands, she accepts the healing water from Zeid.</p>


<p>“……I will return this. Absolutely”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“I will definitely return this favor. Thank you.”</p>

<p>Those were Quena&#8217;s honest words.</p>
<p>Zeid uttered, &#8220;I was the one returning the favor, though&#8230;&#8230;,&#8221; but Quena&#8217;s ears were no longer listening.</p>
<p>Quena goes to the examiner with a debt of gratitude to Zeid in her heart.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>Quena arrives at the examiner.</p>


<p>“This completes the request, right?”</p>


<p>Quena holds out the bottle of healing water.</p>
<p>There is certainly enough in it. It will be no problem—— it was supposed to be.</p>


<p>“……”</p>


<p>The examiner doesn’t respond.</p>
<p>He doesn&#8217;t even look at Quena. Even though all he had to do was receive the bottle she had achieved.</p>
<p>——it’s as if Quena didn’t exist in him.</p>


<p>“Hey. I said the request has been completed &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“……”</p>


<p>He’s not even sleeping.</p>
<p>He has his eyes wide open.</p>
<p>It’s just, he isn’t looking at Quena.</p>
<p>When she thought he finally said a word.</p>


<p>“A~ah. Is there no one worthy of being the hero. Isn’t there anyone who was『Born of a high rank. Has the ability to match it. And has a great charisma』.”</p>


<p>It&#8217;s so loud that it&#8217;s almost as if he&#8217;s trying to talk over Quena.</p>
<p>Quena bit her back teeth with a grit.</p>


<p>“This is the Hero Association!? This is the Hero Exam, right!? No way&#8230;&#8230;! I thought that anyone could be a Hero.”</p>
<p>“Fuhah”</p>


<p>The examiner chuckled at Quena&#8217;s words. For the first time, he reacted.</p>
<p>But the words that came out of his mouth were not good ones.</p>


<p>“It is only with the oracle of the goddess that anyone can become a hero. We, the Hero Association, choose those of high rank. He will be the one who exists as the aspiration of all people.”</p>


<p>The man continues, with his nose in the air and cheeks lifted.</p>


<p>“Zeid and Quena &#8230;&#8230;I have been looking into you guys. You’re both shady guys from out of the blue whom I don&#8217;t know the origin. You want to be heroes? Don&#8217;t get cocky just because you&#8217;re a little powerful!”</p>


<p>The examiner tapped the bottle Quena was holding.</p>
<p>Quena was stunned. Her strength was drained. The bottle rolled down easily and it broke. The water inside was absorbed by the ground.</p>


<p>“Ground beetle, gather in the light. Don&#8217;t try to be the light.”</p>


<p>The examiner laughs as he stomps on the broken bottle.</p>
<p>Finally understanding what has been done by him, Quena looks down in frustration.</p>
<p>There was one person who came between them.</p>


<p>“A’re, don’t you need this?”</p>


<p>It was Zeid.</p>
<p>In his one hand, is an adventurer who fainted.</p>
<p>In his other hand was a piece of a bottle that contained healing water.</p>
<p>Zeid asked, looking at the discarded and broken bottle.</p>


<p>“Haa. Again, here comes <em>someone who doesn’t know his social position</em>.”</p>


<p>This time, the examiner said so, without trying to hide it.</p>


<p>“Byrias-san. This is what you requested for, right? From my eyes, it looked like you had hit the bottle of Quena and dropped it, though”</p>
<p>“Ah? Hahhahhah. I get it. You&#8217;re being greedy with money. I&#8217;ll pay you for your accomplishment money. That’s why, don&#8217;t try to be a Hero and get lost.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I&#8217;m not interested in being a hero, but I don&#8217;t understand you treating me unfairly.”</p>


<p>He grips the moist soil with the healing water.</p>
<p>He then forced it onto Byrias&#8217; hand.</p>


<p>“The healing water can be used in this state, so here. Therefore, the first one to finish this is Quena, right?”</p>
<p>“……Ha? Y,you! To put mud in my hands……!”</p>
<p>“No, no. it&#8217;s healing water. &#8230;&#8230;Hmm, is it healing mud?”</p>
<p>“You bastard……!”</p>


<p>It was the moment when Byrias was about to yell at him with a vein on his forehead.</p>
<p>Quena says, while looking down.</p>


<p>“It’s already fine. Thank you, Zeid”</p>


<p>With that said, Quena starts to walk away.</p>


<p>“Yes, indeed, indeed! Once you understand your status, get the hell out of here—— Bubbe!?”</p>


<p>Zeid silenced Byrias by slapping the mud to his face, as he tried to go after Quena. As if to say, &#8220;Don&#8217;t say anything more”.</p>
<p>—— The guild&#8217;s candidate examination for the hero was a mess.</p>


︎
<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>3: The Next Request</strong></p>



<p>“Another nomination request?&#8221;</p>


<p>Riff called me out and I couldn&#8217;t help but speak it up.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I don&#8217;t want to do it.</p>
<p>However, since the incident with the Hero Association, I no longer have a very good impression of them.</p>


<p>“Umu, it&#8217;s from the Hero Association again. If you don&#8217;t like it, you don’t have to do it, you know?”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t like it, but&#8230;&#8230;”</p>


<p>Fleetingly, I stare at someone next to me.</p>
<p>As usual, in there was the beautiful woman with an unsociable face. Quena.</p>



<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>“What is it”</p>
<p>“Well……”</p>


<p>I recall the words and actions of the client/examiner.</p>
<p>『Ground beetle, should gather in the light. Don&#8217;t try to be the light. 』</p>
<p>No matter how…… it wasn’t pleasing to the ears.</p>
<p>Quena&#8217;s strong desire to be a hero was also beaten to death in front of her eyes.</p>
<p><em>Quena doesn&#8217;t even want to hear the name of the Hero Association anymore. &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>



<p>“Uhmm, hey, Zeid. You don’t really need to think about me, you know?”</p>
<p>“Eh. Really?”</p>


<p>Quena shoots off surprising words.</p>
<p>I looked at her from the side, but she looked quite hurt.</p>


<p>“Honestly, I was really surprised. Since they’ll do many means to do it.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>“What is it. What did the Hero association do to you?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. They don&#8217;t want any heroes from the guild where outlaws have gathered. They said it should be someone more representative of a country.”</p>
<p>“……Hou?”</p>


<p>Quena&#8217;s words made Riff angry. If we were in the forest, she would be so in rage with magic power that birds would fly away from her in a hurry.</p>
<p><em>…… or rather, is it my imagination that she hasn’t said that much?</em></p>


<p>“I see. So that&#8217;s why the halfwit Weeg was chosen. Even though he&#8217;s from a small country, he’s a prince, isn’t he”</p>
<p>“Heh, he was chosen, huh”</p>


<p>I didn&#8217;t expect that.</p>
<p>He didn&#8217;t look very strong, but he was able to reach the heart of the forbidden forest depths, huh. <em>It is not such a sweet place, but I wonder if he took advantage of some kind of confusion.</em></p>
<p>Although he is of a similar rank to Quena, Quena is far superior.</p>


<p>“Then what would you do with this request. It is a nomination request, but I&#8217;ll try not to lower your points or anything.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>



<p>Riff takes out the request form just in case.</p>
<p>I pick it up and check it.</p>
<p>The client organization is the Hero Association.</p>
<p>The content is that it is to guard the place of the final selection of the hero.</p>


<p>&#8220;That would be the place to choose the Hero, right? Why are they asking us to protect them when they&#8217;ve got a bunch of strong guys in there?”</p>
<p>“You’re being sarcastic, you know?”</p>
<p>“……Haha”</p>


<p>I gave a dry laugh at Quena&#8217;s immediate response.</p>
<p>She was already beyond dismay.</p>


<p>“I&#8217;ll receive it. I&#8217;m not particularly backbiting, and I don&#8217;t think of being sarcastic. Nothing will happen, I&#8217;ll just take the money and the points for completing the request.”</p>
<p>“Me too. I have no reason……. to say no.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>



<p>For a moment, the examiner&#8217;s muddy face passed through my mind.</p>
<p>However, that is no reason to refuse.</p>


<p>“Speaking of which, what is the final selection?”</p>
<p>“Umuh. Because what they do is different every year. I think this year, the audience was invited and the candidates were to be engaged in a one-on-one fight. &#8230;&#8230; No, I think that they’ll release the dragon and the candidates subdue it &#8230;&#8230; was it?”</p>
<p>“I see”</p>


<p>Apparently, a strong element of spectacle is there. It seems that the Hero Association also thinks of it as a performance.</p>
<p>Since it would be interesting to see a match between the candidates.</p>


<p>“Dragon slaying, heh. Is this some kind of a fairy tale imitation?”</p>


<p>Quena said irrelevantly.</p>
<p>It seems that there are fairy tales about Heroes defeating dragons. If this is a reenactment of that story, it may be interesting to watch it as an audience.</p>
<p><em>It would be harsh for the dragon to be subdued for entertainment, though.</em></p>


<p>“Well, even if the hero selection test is being publicized, it will not be notified who failed on the way. It should not have been publicly known in the first place. There would be no eyes of contempt for you. It’s fine to look at them at ease.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I suppose so. I&#8217;ll let my fallen fellows lick each other’s wounds.”</p>
<p>“I think it&#8217;s only Zeid and Quena who have been requested, though”</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>“The two of us will lick each other huh”</p>
<p>“……Wha,what stupid things are you talking about!?”</p>
<p>“You’re the one who said it!?”</p>


<p>I was unreasonably poked.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>Well then. The request was to 『guard the place for the final selection of the Hero』.</p>
<p>It seems that the location where the event is held is different every year.</p>
<p>This year, it was to be held in the Holy Republic.</p>
<p>I have thought it was moderately impressive to open the event in a country that must be exhausted from fighting the Knights of the Kingdom of Kuzera, but it seemed that each country had various circumstances.</p>


<p>One, it should be a country with high transportation convenience.</p>
<p>One, it should be a country that is not at war or skirmish with anywhere.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>One, they should be rich in terms of succession.</p>


<p>There are many other factors, but these are the requirements for the venue.</p>
<p>It seems that the knights on the side of the Holy Republic who actually fought against the Knights of the Kingdom of Kuzera, are like from the lowest ranks, and they do not seem to have much impact on the defense of the country.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why, it was chosen by process of elimination.</p>
<p>And with the Saint Soria, Quena also surmised that it was chosen because of its auspiciousness.</p>
<p>And so, we arrive in the Holy Republic.</p>
<p>This time we came to the central city —— the Divine City.</p>
<p>A huge bronze statue of the goddess is erected in the center of the city. It is so huge that it can be recognized even from far outside the city.</p>
<p>She looks like she was praying for peace with her hands together.</p>
<p>To the untrained eye, it&#8217;s both majestic and compassionate, that&#8217;s the kind of statue I&#8217;m talking about.</p>
<p>And this time&#8217;s main selection site.</p>
<p>It is the Colosseum building in the heart of the Divine city. Not only is it built of stone, but it is also lined with numerous magical formulas.</p>
<p>It is sturdier than it looks.</p>
<p>As a person concerned about it, I went inside to find a huge field that could accommodate tens of thousands of people for spectator seating and for spectacular battles.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>



<p>“Amazing. There is such a building in this peaceful place.”</p>


<p>As I was saying this, Quena, who had come from the Kingdom of Kuzera with me, said something wistful.</p>


<p>“Peace and conflict are not different things. The military power of the Holy Republic is also suitable as a great power, and this Colosseum is used not only this time but also on a regular basis.”</p>


<p>Saying that, the people who are preparing for the event are also accustomed to it.</p>
<p>Glancing at my feet, I can see some stains that have signs of use.</p>


<p>“Heh. Is that so”</p>


<p>I am not familiar with national or religious affairs.</p>
<p>However, I understand the image. <em>I understand that it is not only idealistic, but also that it requires a certain strength.</em></p>

<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“Oya oya oya. As I listen to the joke that some adventurers have accepted the request, this is what I see: &#8230;&#8230;it’s you guys huh”</p>


<p>Suddenly, we were called out.</p>
<p>I turned toward the owner of the voice and saw a familiar face.</p>
<p>It was Byrias. He was the client and examiner sent by the Hero Association.</p>
<p>He looks at us mockingly.</p>


<p>“I didn&#8217;t think you&#8217;d actually come! Who else is going to take the job? You want the money that bad? Do you have no sense of shame? Hmm?”</p>


<p>It was a rather childish provocation.</p>
<p>The way he laughs also looks like he himself is trying to humiliate us, but it only looks like he is making a funny face.</p>


<p>“Since a request is a request.”</p>


<p>I answer on behalf of Quena, who is already too stunned to even look at me.</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Then, perhaps not liking my response, a miffed Byrias glared at me.</p>


<p>“So you said that honestly. You came here just because you could get paid even if you were lazy, didn&#8217;t you? You people are greedy for money. After all, you don&#8217;t even know your own birthplace!”</p>


<p>Byrias then <em>hahaha’d, </em>making a big laugh.</p>
<p>His voice echoed beautifully throughout the Colosseum, attracting stares.</p>


<p>“So where do we go? Where do you mainly need us to guard?”</p>
<p>“……Tsk. You&#8217;re acting like you don&#8217;t give a damn. You guys should be sitting in the audience seats or something! And, you should watch the program with your fingers crossed. becoming a hero, you&#8217;ll never reach it in your lifetime!”</p>
<p>“Understood”</p>


<p>This request was apparently really just a sarcasm.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I thought I was going to be asked to help with some kind of performance.</p>
<p>For example, this time, they prepared an event in which the candidates had to slay a dragon, but we, who had come as guards, had to be defeated first by them. Then after that, the one who will become the hero will be decided! Or something like that.</p>
<p><em>Isn’t this just a waste of money then.</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“By.byrias-sama! The dragon for the event has escaped. &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“Wha,what!? Anything is fine! Just go out there and get some dragons!”</p>


<p>……what a story I heard.</p>
<p><em>Are they alright, there.</em></p>





<p>As I sat and waited in the hall with nothing to do, people gradually began to gather.</p>
<p>Even if the goddess didn&#8217;t officially choose them, they still have the brand power of a hero.</p>
<p>Half of the seats in the general spectator area alone were nearly full. It increased further more from here. Lively voices could also be heard from outside the venue.</p>
<p>I was sitting on the seat facing the stairs from the flight when I was bumped by a person from behind.</p>
<p>However, it isn’t powerful. Rather, it can be described as light.</p>

<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“Awawa, I&#8217;m sorry!”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I&#8217;m fine. Are you hurt?”</p>


<p>I checked the owner of the voice that hit me, and as I thought, it was a small child.</p>
<p>She wears a not so flatteringly beautiful hood with her eyes deep in the hood. I don&#8217;t know if she is a girl or a boy because her voice probably hasn&#8217;t even changed yet. However, I kinda think that she is a girl.</p>
<p>In her hand was a long, thin object placed in a cloth.</p>


<p>“Yes. Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“Pri,priest-sama…… are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Yes, let’s hurry. To the front seat as much as possible”</p>


<p><em>Priest-sama?</em></p>
<p>Such words came from a man who came from behind the girl.</p>
<p>But I have no time to ask them, as they hurried to get to the popular front row.</p>
<p>Well, I guess the religion which is interested in the Hero are doing some sort of inspection tour.</p>

<p>In fact, the front row was already occupied by a group that clearly belongs to the same organization. They were taking their seats with a strange degree of unity and coordination.</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s a place where various people really gather, huh.</em></p>
<p>Looking further up, there were some private rooms fitted with glass on the upper tier of the Colosseum.</p>
<p>People wearing luxurious clothes were inside there.</p>
<p>Then, another awe-inspiring woman wearing a red dress enters the magnificent room. Following her was a group in military uniforms. <em>——A’re, Quena?</em></p>
<p>No, it’s not. Quena is next to me.</p>
<p>But they are similar. They&#8217;re two peas in a pod.</p>
<p><em>……Ah. Come to think of it, I saw it in the news.</em></p>
<p><em>No way, is she the rumored Empress?</em></p>
<p>To confirm it, I call out to Quena, who is standing next to me looking bored.</p>


<p>“Quena, is that”</p>
<p>“——!&#8230;&#8230;Luina. My sister.”</p>
<p>“Seriously”</p>


<p>Quena grits her teeth.</p>
<p>Looks like I was right on.</p>
<p>I had no idea that even the Empress had come to see the event. <em>Is this such a big event?</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“Don’t act violently, okay?”</p>
<p>“What’s that, you talk about people like they&#8217;re stampeding horses”</p>
<p>“Well, it seems that Quena has some kind of connection to the Empress, so it was just in case.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine. There was just a story of her becoming the new empress, so she needs to show off, right. I was expecting this much.”</p>


<p>Sighing, she crosses her arms and lean back in her chair.</p>
<p>Looking at this attitude, it seems that the empress Luina is the source of Quena&#8217;s bad mood.</p>
<p>For a moment, I thought I caught a glimpse of a glance from the empress toward me. <em>I wonder if she took a glance at Quena.</em></p>
<p>They are sisters, after all.</p>
<p>Originally, Quena wanted to stand in the field where the selected is.</p>
<p>Then she would have been able to look back at her sister.</p>
<p>There is an indescribable itchiness which couldn’t be said.</p>


<p>“Ah, there they are. Hey! Adventurers!”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>


<p>A voice called out to us.</p>
<p>His attire was not that of an employee of the Colosseum, but that of the Hero association.</p>
<p>He came close to me and opened his mouth, while hiding it with his hand so that no one around me could hear.</p>


<p>“We&#8217;ve got a captive dragon on a rampage, and I need your help!”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>


<p>I ask honestly.</p>


<p>“Why, you said…… Byrias-san said we could use you guys! You&#8217;re useless anyway, so why don&#8217;t you at least work here!”</p>
<p>“Hmm. The request is only to 『guard the place for the final selection of the heroes』.”</p>
<p>“Ha?”</p>
<p>“That’s why, I&#8217;m not going to make a move because it&#8217;s not part of the request to capture it.”</p>
<p>“No……! This is a legitimate protection!”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t think so. Because there is no dragon here that I should guard against. If it comes all the way here and still on a rampage, it means it was just out of your control, having too much trouble for you.”</p>
<p>“Tsk……! Garbage! Even though we went to the trouble of capturing the royal dragon bloodline&#8230;&#8230;!”</p>


<p>He spat out a sharp parting remark, and left.</p>
<p>In truth, I could help him if I wanted to. Though my claim is quibble. <em>Since if it broke out, it could run amok here.</em></p>
<p>Still, I didn&#8217;t lend a hand, probably because I was irritated.</p>


<p>“I guess that disqualifies me from being an adventurer.”</p>
<p>“That’s not the case, is what I would like to tell you. Otherwise, I who didn&#8217;t go would be disqualified as well.”</p>


<p>While having such a conversation, I looked at the event venue where the enthusiasm was gradually increasing.</p>


<p style= "text-align:center;">︎<strong>4: Intruder</strong></p>

<p>The final selection of the Hero has begun.</p>
<p>The man&#8217;s voice echoes throughout the Colosseum with a loudspeaker magic item.</p>


<p>『The time has come, ladies and gentlemen! The time has come for us to decide who will be the next 【hero】!! 』</p>


<p>His voice brought the audience to their feet.</p>
<p>The voices of those who were outside the Colosseum also echoed through the place.</p>


<p>『The events taking place at this Colosseum are currently being broadcasted live in seven countries !!』</p>


<p>Then, he begins with a polite explanation.</p>
<p>Then he told the audience the story of the hero, and the introduction of the Hero Association who cooperated with him, in a talk that the audience would never get bored of, and finally, it began.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>The facilitator calls out the names of the potential heroes.</p>
<p>Along with that, more and more people with an aura of strength, young and old, men and women, entered the venue. Gradually, the audience&#8217;s cheers grew more enthusiastic.</p>


<p>『——And the next fierce competitor! He is the first prince of the Kingdom of Stillbeats, and an assassin from the Adventurers&#8217; Guild, a group of strong combatants! Weeg Stilbeeeeeets!! 』</p>


<p>A man says Weeg&#8217;s name out loud.</p>
<p>Weeg responded to the call by raising his hand. The face he turns up seems to be full of confidence. &#8230;&#8230; But there is a shadow on his face somewhere.</p>
<p>He would have had more luminous and sparkling eyes, but now his eyes look as if they have been touched by the darkness of this world.</p>
<p><em>I wonder what has happened to him in the past few days.</em></p>


<p>『Now, now, let&#8217;s witness what you&#8217;ve all been waiting for! The head of the elite 《0th Army》 from the Weira Empire, which boasts the strongest military power of a powerful country with tradition and prestige! He has destroyed numerous armies single-handedly! He has slaughtered the most tyrannical monsters! A legendary man!! Bashina Eirakkkk!!! 』</p>


<p>A good-looking, well-dressed man enters with an ear-piercing cheer.</p>
<p>All of the hero candidates are undeniably strong, and not a single one of them is weak. But among them, one, in particular, stood out in an unusual way.</p>
<p><em>I guess he must be in his late thirties.</em></p>
<p>He is a green-haired man with a large sword on his back. He stands out with the gap between his wild stubble and his prestigious-looking military uniform.</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>But the thing that gets the most attention is different. The eyes of the audience were gathered below his face.</p>
<p>His white, prestigious-looking military garments were covered in fresh blood. Even now, red streaks were dripping down his clothes.</p>
<p>However, he’s not injured. It was a spurt of blood from something. It is also not the blood we see from the density of the blood or from residual magic power. It is from the blood of a higher species of monster.</p>


<p>“……What is, that?”</p>


<p>Quena asked me, looking at him quizzically.</p>


<p>“You know about that guy from the hero association who just asked me to help him capture a dragon?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Don’t tell me”</p>
<p>“Ah. He was holding it down all by himself”</p>


<p>I know it because when I arrived at the Colosseum, I deployed detection magic just in case.</p>
<p>A man was defeating a dragon with fairly high magic power all by himself. And that too, perhaps he was adjusting his power so as not to interfere with the selection process.</p>
<p>He would be head and shoulders above the strongest of the hero candidates.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>



<p>“Bashina Eirak…… It looks like the rumors are true.”</p>
<p>“You know him?&#8221;</p>
<p>“Yes, he is a soldier of the Weira Empire. I heard that he has joined Luina&#8217;s inner circle.”</p>
<p>“Wow, it’s no wonder”</p>


<p>The military uniform of the man called Bashina was similar to those of the people by Luina&#8217;s side. The only difference is the color. Bashina is white and the others are black.</p>
<p>In terms of ability, Bashina is probably higher, so he may be a leader class.</p>


<p>“Is he, strong in Zeid&#8217;s eyes?”</p>
<p>“Once you get to a certain level, no one can see the bottom of your strength, and Bashina is at that level.”</p>


<p>The amount of magic power. The magic skill. The way he carried himself. The muscles he used. And last the intuition. The anticipation of how much experience he has gained.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m trying to get a general idea of his power by mixing and matching those areas.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t understand the whole strength for some people.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>That&#8217;s Bashina.</p>


<p>“Hmm…… By the way, what about me?”</p>
<p>“………………I can&#8217;t see it.”</p>
<p>“What’s that, in the meantime. How is it really?”</p>
<p>“I, can’t see it…… but, to be honest”</p>


<p>I said so, and she looks grumpy, as I expected.</p>
<p>She must be trying to compare herself with Bashina. Bashina, the aide of the Empress, and herself. <em>As the quickest way to be recognized.</em></p>


<p>“Let me tell you something. Since it&#8217;s 『I can&#8217;t see it』. It wouldn&#8217;t have been the case if you were a step different. You&#8217;re strong enough. And you also have a sense. It’s just that you have an age difference with Bashina.”</p>


<p>I supplemented so just in case.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a detailed numerical measurement of him. I have spent a lot of time with Quena, so I have a clearer picture of her abilities, though.</p>


<p>“Don&#8217;t worry. It’s fine, since I&#8217;m not in a hurry.”</p>


<p>Quena smiled a little as she said it. On the contrary, I was the one she took care of.</p>
<p><em>……But, well.</em></p>
<p>Bashina is stronger than Quena, minus the fact that we have been together more often. <em>There is a clear-cut difference.</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>Quena would be about on par with the Empress&#8217; entourage, but Bashina could be considered different.</p>
<p>As if to prove it, the cheering of the audience has not yet stopped.</p>


<p>『Now, ladies and gentlemen! Let&#8217;s get to the final selection right away! It will only be one main event with no starter! ——Come on out! 』</p>


<p>When the facilitator raises his hand, a pre-arranged magic formula is deployed. A large amount of smoke emerges, and there’s pale light barely leaking through its gaps.</p>
<p>The performance looks as if the man has used magic.</p>


<p>『Goooouuhhh!』</p>


<p>Its roar was so huge that it left anyone’s ears ringing.</p>
<p>Tension is transmitted throughout the venue.</p>
<p>A tail as big as a pillar scatters the smoke as if it were in the way. ——The first thing that appeared was a single black dragon.</p>
<p>It has a huge stature that far surpasses the summoning circle deployed in the center. It has bright black scales. It has an enormous amount of magic power that bathes it outside its body.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what the position of the king dragon is among the dragon tribes, but I guess they are a kingly race of dragons in terms of its name. <em>They are as strong as their name, I guess.</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>But it is clearly wary of one person. <em>Bashina.</em></p>


<p>『Oops! A dragon jumped out of the summoning circle &#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s also a King dragon! However, the King Dragon is wary of Bashina! 』</p>


<p>It&#8217;s a deliberate live commentary.</p>
<p>But that seems to be the hot development the audience is looking for. It&#8217;s heating up from the beginning.</p>


<p>“It&#8217;s a clear result.”</p>


<p>Quena voiced her opinion from a cold point of view.</p>
<p><em>Ah.</em></p>
<p>The King Dragon has been injured in many places. It has been tortured inconspicuously.</p>
<p>It looks like it can&#8217;t even move its wings and can&#8217;t fly.</p>
<p>They may be trying to stage an overwhelming victory, but it has already been weakened by Bashina.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s obvious now. The end is in sight —— or so I thought.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>



<p>『『『Goooooooooouuuuuhhhn! 』』』</p>


<p>Dragons’ roar, which was released from a distant place but was so loud that it gave the illusion of being right next to us, echoed through the Colosseum in ten or twenty layers.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>It became dark as if rain clouds have covered the sky.</p>
<p>Currently, such a natural phenomenon was being caused by a swarm of creatures.</p>
<p>They’re ancient creatures that is said to have been born long before the human race, and legend has it that they have fought with the Gods. ——Dragons.</p>
<p>Black, red, and blue &#8230;&#8230; although their colors were different, they were swarming and attacking the sacred capital of the Holy Republic.</p>


<p>『Gaah——Kyaaaaaaaaaiiin』</p>


<p>The facilitator drops the microphone in surprise, forgetting that he has it in his hand. He emitted an unpleasant high-pitched noise, but it was drowned out by the screams of the people.</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>The sound of repeated impacts echoed through the air. It must be the sound of the dragon&#8217;s breath destroying a building. Their breath is basically a mass of hot liquid.</p>
<p>However, because of its tremendous density and speed, even though it is a liquid, it also has destructive power.</p>


<p>““Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!””</p>
<p>““Uwaaaaaaaaaaaahh!””</p>


<p>The spectators in the Colosseum, who were the first to realize what was happening, began to flee towards the exit. They probably intend to flee the sacred city at this point.</p>
<p>The next are those who reflexively run away. As if taking a ride, a wave of people is created.</p>


<p>“Zeid, what is this!?”</p>


<p>Quena flurries to me.</p>
<p>Unlike me, who had a perfect grasp of the situation through detection magic, Quena relied only on her eyes and ears.</p>


<p>“Dragons are attacking. And a lot of them. Not a hundred or two hundred. It&#8217;s over a thousand.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“……Thousands!? That&#8217;s impossible &#8230;&#8230;! Why &#8230;&#8230;!?”</p>


<p>When Quena peers out of the venue, she was wide-eyed in disbelief.</p>
<p>At first, I too thought that the detection magic had gone crazy. But since the Colosseum was actually enveloped in darkness, there was no room for doubt.</p>


<p>“Why, you say. It was said when we first met Byrias in this place, right”</p>
<p>“……?”</p>


<p>It doesn&#8217;t seem to ring a bell on her.</p>
<p>I recite again the words of Byrias.</p>


<p>『By.byrias-sama! The dragon for the event has escaped. &#8230;&#8230;! 』</p>
<p>『Wha,what!? Anything is fine! Just go get any dragon you can find around here! 』</p>


<p>“He,he was indeed saying that. Then another one from the Hero Association came in and said something further, right”</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>



<p>『Even though we went to the trouble of capturing the royal dragon bloodline&#8230;&#8230;! 』</p>


<p>“……And so on. Luckily or unluckily, the King dragon they caught must have attracted its comrades. Well, it was probably Bashina, rather than the Hero Association, that pulled off the feat of capturing the King dragon, though.”</p>
<p>“I see. I think Zeid&#8217;s guess is correct. This odd number is probably because it was a King dragon. Because among dragons, they are, as their name implies, kings.”</p>
<p>“It’s not just their power, but their status as well?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Moreover, that&#8217;s the King Dragon&#8217;s child. That’s why the dragons must be pretty angry.”</p>
<p>“……Child? That one, is?”</p>


<p>Quena&#8217;s words come as a shock to me.</p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s a giant that fills half the field, you know. That&#8217;s a child?</em></p>
<p>Its magic power and robust body are greater than that of any monster in its prime. <em>That&#8217;s a child?</em></p>
<p>Even at the depths of the forbidden forest, no one was called a child at this level. If they had told me that it was already an adult, I would have been convinced.</p>


<p>“……Oh well. I&#8217;ll carry out the request.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“Executing it, in this situation is…… wait!”</p>


<p>I jumped down from the spectator’s seats and landed on my feet on the field to avoid bumping into the audiences who were scurrying away.</p>
<p>Quena follows behind me.</p>


<p>『Gururururu……!』</p>


<p>The black dragon is making a threatening sound.</p>
<p>In front of it, Bashina was taking a relaxed attitude.</p>
<p>Moreover, the potential heroes are in a state of maximum alert and are ready for battle, each with their weapons at bay.</p>
<p>Then I interrupt from the side.</p>


<p>“Stop. I&#8217;m going to have to ask you to put an end to this”</p>
<p>“Ze,Zeid!”</p>

<p>Weeg, who knows me, raised his voice.</p>
<p>After him, Bashina looks at me with a laid-back attitude.</p>


<p>“You have stopped us, but this isn&#8217;t going to help, is it? First we have to stop the King Dragon&#8217;s breath.”</p>


<p>Bashina pulls out the great sword on his back and points it at the dragon.</p>


<p>“I&#8217;m sorry, but I can&#8217;t let you do that. I&#8217;m an adventurer who has been commissioned. Let me defend this 『final selection of the Hero』.”</p>
<p>“Hou. But what would you do? There are a lot of dragons outside and in the sky. Can you protect us? Are you being mad as hell?”</p>


<p>Bashina asked me a question, so when I tried to answer,</p>


<p>“Oy! What are you doing! Get your ass out there and take down that pack of dragons on the outside!”</p>


<p>Byrias came into the field while sweating.</p>
<p>He was impatient with the bizarre situation.</p>


<p>“Ye,yes, that&#8217;s right! The one who contributes the most will be the Hero! We were actually going to have the audience vote and decide who deserved it, but&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; well, whatever! This time, the one who slays the most dragons will be the Hero!”</p>


<p>He’s still talking about Heroes even during this period.</p>
<p>No matter how valuable a hero is, it won&#8217;t be the most important thing in such a terrible situation.</p>


<p>“O,oy! You adventurers too! How dare you say no to me at the time of its captivity&#8230;&#8230;! This time, I will not tolerate such negligence! Get on with it quickly!”</p>
<p>“That’s that”</p>


<p>I let out a sigh and headed for the king dragon.</p>
<p>They are as menacing as the <em>hiss</em> of the snakes. A dragon has a high degree of intelligence. Some are even smarter than other people.</p>

<p>“Do you, understand me?”</p>
<p>『……Gururururu……!』</p>
<p>“You have been driven into a corner. But don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll let you go. Just calm those guys outside down.”</p>
<p>『………… Now you&#8217;re freaking out? Do you feel regret in catching me now!? 』</p>


<p>The King dragon spoke directly into my head.</p>
<p>I’m glad. There was a possibility that even a monster with high intelligence could not understand the language if it was a child. <em>Since it is the king of dragons, it seems to be very wise.</em></p>


<p>“Ah. It’s something like that. So can you just get this over with?”</p>
<p>『Fuhahahaha! You idiot! This is your punishment! You&#8217;ve kept me locked up for a long, long time. &#8230;&#8230;! I will definitely pay you back for this! 』</p>


<p><em>……For a long time…… locked up?</em></p>
<p>That’s strange.</p>
<p>This dragon should have been found a while ago and have been captured quickly. <em>Does it feel like it was a long time? </em></p>


<p>“——I heard that. Were you the ones who were pulling the string here, adventurers?”</p>


<p>From next to the conversation between the King Dragon and I ——.</p>
<p>A beautiful woman with a long red hair interrupted us with the high sound of her high heels.</p>
<p>The Weira Empire’s Empress——Luina Weira.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>Quena looked at Luina, who had come down to the field, with a complex emotion of surprise and glaring.</p>


<p>“Luina……!”</p>
<p>“Hey, adventurer. Don&#8217;t call her by her name casually.”</p>

<p>Luina&#8217;s entourage admonishes Quena.</p>
<p>It seems that this won’t be a sisterly emotional reunion. Luina doesn&#8217;t give Quena a single glance.</p>
<p>Luina says to Byrias.</p>

<p>“Man from the Hero Association. I want all the magic items that are connected to the broadcast to show the state of the capital.”</p>
<p>“Ha,hah!?”</p>
<p>“I’m telling you to show us the state of the Holy Republic being hit.”</p>
<p>“I,in this kind of situation!?”</p>
<p>“Ah. I wonder how fragile is a country that can be counted among the powers on par with our Weira Empire &#8230;&#8230; And it will show which country is truly strong.”</p>

<p>Luina grins invincibly.</p>


<p>“What are you planning &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>&#8220;I said you shouldn&#8217;t call her casually, didn’t I!?”</p>


<p>One of her entourages stops Quena, who is leaning forward as if to close in on her, by pointing his sword at her.</p>
<p>Quena grits her teeth at the pressure, which isn’t light.</p>


<p>“Quena, people with strong magic power are beginning to gather in the sacred city. They are probably —— an army”</p>
<p>“…….Tu. You mean that it is a…… right”</p>
<p>“Ah”</p>


<p>It was short words, but Quena easily understood it.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps this whole affair was orchestrated by the empire.</em></p>
<p>It’s from the fact that the dragon for the selection has escaped from the Hero Association, and that the King Dragon was conveniently found.</p>
<p>Or maybe they&#8217;ve been turning their hands for a long time.</p>
<p>Their objective would be to 『show which country is truly strong』, as Luina had said. They had called in their nearby troops for this purpose.</p>
<p><em>Were those troops stationed with the permission of the Holy Republic or were they hiding in secret &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>
<p>There’s no way for me to know it now because of the suddenness.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s all I need to know.</p>


<p>“I&#8217;m sorry, but I can&#8217;t let you fight the dragon.”</p>


<p>Now it was my turn to interrupt from the side.</p>
<p>I stand s in front of her entourages who are trying to surround the King dragon’s child.</p>


<p>“You are……?”</p>


<p>Luina speaks up.</p>
<p>Her sharp eyes are already that of an empress.</p>


<p>“I&#8217;m Zeid, an adventurer from the guild. I&#8217;ve been asked to guard this place.”</p>


<p>I point my index finger at the field under my feet.</p>
<p>Luina, who understood instantly, snickered.</p>
<p>And her entourages immediately surround me.</p>


<p>“Sorry, guild small fry, but you&#8217;ll have to stay out of our way. This is a prestige operation of the Weira Empire.”</p>

<p>Luina said so.</p>
<p>She continues further.</p>


<p>“If you really want to move, then fight them. You have a few idiot seniors among them, you know?”</p>
<p>“Senior?”</p>


<p>I glance at the entourages that was surrounding me.</p>
<p>One of them, Bashina, tells me with a surplus smile.</p>


<p>“I also used to belong to the guild. Now I&#8217;m in the Weira Empire. My rank was——S”</p>


<p>As he says this, Bashina swings his great sword in a single horizontal flash.</p>
<p>I backstep down.</p>


<p>“Oops”</p>


<p>It was so fast that the sound of wind follows the slash. Naturally, the destructive power is also high in proportion to its speed.</p>
<p>The tip of the big sword had hit me and my clothes were torn.</p>


<p>“I see”</p>


<p>Several of the entourages here seemed to be from the guild.</p>
<p>So in that sense, they are my 『senior』.</p>


<p>“Would you like me to correct only one thing?”</p>
<p>“Ahn?”</p>
<p>“You are——”</p>
<p>“Tsu!”</p>


<p>I run while putting strength in my legs and feet.</p>
<p>The field has collapsed somewhat due to the recoil, but this did not interfere with the implementation of the selection. So, it would be no obstacle to the request of guarding the place of the final selection of the hero.</p>
<p>Rather, my priority would be to get rid of the 『disturbers』.</p>


<p>“—— 『former』 S-rank, right?”</p>


<p>I close in on him and kick him off.</p>
<p>It was loaded with power, with the meaning of paying back for my clothes.</p>

<p>“Guih……!”</p>

<p>Bashina tried to stop it with his great sword, but he flew.</p>
<p>He even flew as far as to the audience seats.</p>
<p>Dusts danced around with the wreckage.</p>

<p>“Oh, man. This may indeed be a hindrance.”</p>

<p>I said so involuntarily.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Luina&#8217;s entourage of strongmen.</p>
<p>It was also an expression of Weira Empire&#8217;s new empress Luina&#8217;s policy of attracting talent on the basis of merit.</p>
<p>In fact, all of her aides were chosen only by their ability.</p>
<p>She pulled out several S-ranks from the guild, knights who had made a name for themselves in a small country, and selected a young man who was rumored to become the next general.</p>
<p>All of them were excellent.</p>
<p>They are a group of gems worthy of being called the 『Elite』 of the human race.</p>
<p>They —— were not even a twitch of a finger in front of just a single man.</p>
<p>The man who was the head of the entourage is unconscious, having plunged into the audience seats.</p>
<p>He was pulled out of the guild as if changing places with Quena, so he never heard of Zeid or Quena.</p>
<p>But still, he was once an S-rank, an outstanding man who made a name for himself in many countries. Everyone in the entourage took a glance at him.</p>
<p>Even after defeating that man, the thing that came out of Zeid’s mouth was,</p>

<p>『Oh, man. This may indeed be a hindrance. 』</p>

<p>It was words of worry about the request.</p>
<p>The strength of the former S-rank was not even on his radar.</p>
<p>The fighting spirit of the entourages, who had not even felt the need to be wary of Zeid, was instantly reduced to rock bottom.</p>
<p>Some even shook their knees at the immense power of the man standing in front of them. Some prayed to God that hopefully it was just a bad dream.</p>

<p>“Is the talk over? Then it’s about the request, but……. Byrias-san, you don&#8217;t have a problem with me breaking those audience seats or the fact that I beat a hero candidate, right?”</p>

<p>Zeid looked away from the motionless entourage and Luina, and pointed his index finger at the broken audience seats while addressing the aghast Byrias.</p>
<p>Byrias regains his composure with a huff.</p>

<p>“……A,ah…… no. Tsk, it can’t be helped. Just protect it!”</p>
<p>“Yes. I understand”</p>

<p>Zeid heads for the King Dragon with a smile, without even being frustrated by his violent words.</p>
<p>The king dragon was beaten up and captured by Bashina.</p>
<p>And it was so tame that he could see it himself.</p>
<p>It was in awe of Zeid, who easily kicked that Bashina to the curb. It understood that if this man wanted to, he could easily obliterate him.</p>
<p>That’s why, it had resigned itself to swallowing whatever Zeid had to say.</p>
<p>A noble monster, the bloodline of the Dragon King, held its tongue.</p>
<p>However, the words that came out of Zeid were quite unexpected.</p>

<p>“That guy Byrias, is the one who took you captive, so how about you just do something about him?”</p>
<p>““““!?””””</p>

<p>Everyone in the room was taken aback.</p>
<p>Quena, Luina, her entourages, and the King dragon.</p>
<p>But—— he decided that it was for the best.</p>

<p>“Look, we&#8217;ve got all these dragons here, and you must have got a clue on how to settle this, right? I want you to forgive me for that, though”</p>
<p>“Yo,you bastard! What are you talking about…….! What happened to the request!?”</p>
<p>“Request? It was to guard this place, right? It&#8217;s not about your protection.”</p>
<p>“Ha……hah!?”</p>

<p>Byrias loses his rebuttal to Zeid&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>His reason for the random request was for revenge.</p>

<p>『Is that……. Fine?』</p>
<p>“Rather, I&#8217;m sorry that I can&#8217;t provide you with anything else, I could only prepare something like this.”</p>

<p>Zeid understood.</p>
<p>The real reason for this struggle. <em>Where is the cause and the source.</em></p>
<p>But he cannot reveal that here. If the dragon side learns the truth, the battle could start again here. This would make the request for the protection more troublesome, and it would increase the number of casualties among the general public. <em>Therefore, he was trying to get this to work.</em></p>
<p>The king dragon as well, can only nod its head.</p>
<p>In the first place, just by finding out the <em>missing point, </em>which is Byrias, it was filled with gratitude and astonishment all at once.</p>
<p>The King dragon envisions multiple words and asks first.</p>

<p>『Let me hear your name. 』</p>
<p>“Hmm, it’s Zeid. Zeid, an S-rank adventurer in the guild. If you have any trouble, please come to me for a nomination request.”</p>
<p>『……Zeid………… understood. Then I shall return with my brethren who are running amok outside. 』</p>

<p>The king dragon opens its wings.</p>
<p>In this short time, most of its injured parts had healed. <strong><em>It has indeed a remarkable healing power. </em></strong></p>
<p>In this way, the curtain of this turmoil was about to come down.</p>
<p>But of course, it&#8217;s not over yet.</p>

<p>“Wait, you from the guild”</p>

<p>It’s Luina.</p>
<p>She puts aside her timid entourage and steps forward herself.</p>
<p>She herself was not very powerful. She had some education, but at best she was of C rank in the guild.</p>
<p>But her natural dignity made her stop Zeid in his tracks.</p>

<p>“Zeid, aren&#8217;t you interested in your current status?”</p>

<p>Luina said so clearly.</p>
<p>There was no joke in those words of Luina.</p>
<p>Her face is serious as well.</p>
<p>The Weira Empire is one of the great powers. If it were only for its military power, it would be one of the strongest nations of the human race.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s not surprising considering its huge amount of money added to its military spending, and the combined military strength of the countries under its umbrella.</p>
<p>Each of them also has a high fighting ability.</p>
<p>Luina&#8217;s entourages were by no means weak either.</p>
<p>Although few people are unaware of their prowess. They are those who have made a name for themselves to a degree.</p>
<p>But Zeid was too unorthodox.</p>

<p>“Status?”</p>

<p>Zeid asked back.</p>
<p><em>Just what is she talking about.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“Ah. Come to the Weira Empire. Become my subordinate.”</p>
<p>“……Subordinate?”</p>

<p>Zeid crosses his arms.</p>
<p>He is pondering, while wrinkling his eyebrows.</p>

<p>“What are you thinking for? There is everything in the Weira Empire. Those who are strong can quickly become officers in my power. You can even become my aide.”</p>

<p>She extends her hand as she was saying so.</p>
<p>She continues.</p>

<p>“You can have money, food, women, houses, land, and soldiers at your disposal! If you don&#8217;t get a request in the guild, you&#8217;ll starve to death! But the empire is different! It is the true ruling power! There is no room for you to hesitate! Come with us!”</p>

<p><em>There was no way he would refuse</em>. She looked convinced of that.</p>
<p>She has an unwavering smile.</p>
<p>In fact, no one has ever turned down an invitation from the Weira Empire.</p>
<p>Its overwhelming history and strength cancel out anyone’s reason to refuse.</p>
<p>Any kind of resources are in the empire. If not, it can be taken from the countries under its control.</p>
<p>A position in the Weira empire would satisfy every desire.</p>
<p>On that.</p>
<p>Zeid opened his mouth with one eyebrow lowered.</p>

<p>&#8221; ―― I suppose I could take it as a request, but I think it would be more cost-effective to hire mercenaries, don&#8217;t you think?”</p>
<p>“Ha?”</p>

<p>At that moment.</p>
<p>Luina&#8217;s thoughts stopped.</p>
<p>Emperor, Empress.</p>
<p>This has never happened to her since she was born.</p>
<p>There was no one around her who could believe it.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t allowed for her to lose the power struggle.</p>
<p>The danger for her life is constantly drawing near.</p>
<p>Therefore, her instincts did not allow her to have a twitch in her thought process.</p>
<p>It was supposed to, but the invitation she thought he could never refuse &#8230;&#8230;. got <em>probably</em> turned down.</p>

<p>“……Wha,what do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Do I need to explain it? I can&#8217;t say anything, because I have a vague memory, too. For more information, it would be quicker to have you contact them directly, but I just felt like you were saying that you would 『make me your subordinate』 as a request to the guild. Look, at first glance, I think that would be a violation of the guild rules now, right? But certainly――&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeid talks at length about the rules of the guild.</p>
<p>As if he didn&#8217;t think for a second that he was being headhunted.</p>
<p>Luina&#8217;s eyes darted around, blinking repeatedly in amazement as Zeid told his story.</p>

<p>(What is he talking about &#8230;&#8230;? Eh, request &#8230;&#8230;? What does he mean? No, I mean I’m pulling him out of the guild? Is that a no……?)</p>

<p>Questions go through Luina&#8217;s mind.</p>
<p>No one has ever turned down her offer.</p>
<p>No one failed to understand that it was a scouting.</p>
<p>This is because any talented person who knows the Empire, has a faint expectation that if they are recognized as a fierce competitor, they may be pulled out by the Weira Empire.</p>
<p>Luina understood that.</p>
<p>Because she knew that, she couldn’t hide her surprise at the situation, the man in front of her not realizing that he was being recruited.</p>

<p>“Wait, Zeid. That is not a request. It&#8217;s a job offer.”</p>
<p>“Ah, they’re headhunting me huh!”</p>

<p>When he got it, he slaps his right hand in a rock form and his left hand in paper, smacking them together.</p>
<p><em>You finally get it huh, </em>thus Luina nods.</p>
<p>Then, with a smile, Zeid spoke up.</p>

<p>“Then I&#8217;ll pass. Since I have no complaints with the guild.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s right. You were about to turn down the Empire&#8217;s offer&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;. What was that?&#8221;</p>
<p>“I don’t want to work under you. I like the freedom the guild provides me right now. And there is this beautiful adventurer senpai who teaches me how to do my job when she’s really occupied with her own, you know?”</p>
<p>“!&#8230;&#8230;You”</p>

<p>When Zeid looks at her, Quena made a surprised look on her face. It was a single sentence that, in Zeid&#8217;s own way, made Luina turn her attention to Quena.</p>
<p>Quena&#8217;s mouth breaks into a little smile of happiness at this. But Luina doesn’t remove her attention from Zeid.</p>

<p>“Wait, think again. The imperial soldier is also much freer than other professions. Besides, you can get what you desire as much as you want, better than the guild and such. And not to mention, you&#8217;re getting an invitation from me personally, you know!?”</p>
<p>&#8220;No, I&#8217;m not interested.&#8221;</p>

<p>Zeid chases her away ”<em>shi shi</em>” in annoyance.</p>

<p>“Impossible! It&#8217;s an invitation from the empire, you know!?&#8221;</p>
<p>“No, no. You&#8217;re the ones who set up this whole thing in the Holy Republic, right? I don&#8217;t know if I can keep up with you suspicious people.”</p>
<p>“Suspicious people you say. It doesn&#8217;t matter what one does behind the scenes, as long as it leads to victory and they have power. Throw away those thoughts!”</p>

<p>At Luina&#8217;s suggestion, Zeid reflected on his memories.</p>

<p>“Is that so. I know people who have been doing that kind of <em>behind-the-scenes</em> maneuvering. I wonder what happened to them. I can&#8217;t help but think that your appearance overlaps with them. Sooner or later —— I have a feeling you&#8217;re going to end up with something similar.” <em>(TN: I think he’s talking about the First unit of the Kuzera)</em></p>
<p>“You think we&#8217;ll be punished? Fuh. &#8230;&#8230; you have a different way of thinking.”</p>

<p>Luina bites her lip in frustration.</p>
<p>Then, finally, one of her entourages huffed and regained his composure.</p>

<p>“Lu.Luina-sama. We have to go soon &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“……That’s right. I get it. Oy, Zeid! I won&#8217;t forget you. If you ever change your mind, come to me!”</p>
<p>“Ah. Okay, okay”</p>

<p>Zeid waved, implying that anything would be fine if she would go.</p>
<p>And so, Luina and the others left.</p>
<p>The only ones left were the Hero candidates, Quena and Zeid, the king dragon, and Byrias.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>“&#8230;&#8230; Hence, I&#8217;m leaving, but how much longer are you guys going to stand around here in a daze?”</p>

<p>I asked those who were standing in the conversation between me and Luina and were eavesdropping without interrupting.</p>
<p>They were the King Dragon, Byrias, the hero candidates, and Quena.</p>
<p>The dragons outside are being withdrawn by the King dragon, signaling them with magic and sounds that cannot be heard by humans.</p>
<p>Other than that, no one spoke or went anywhere but stared at us.</p>

<p>“Ze,Zeid……!”</p>

<p>Weeg reacts to my voice.</p>
<p>It wasn’t a loud voice, but it was somewhat full of emotion.</p>

<p>“I &#8230;&#8230; foolishly referred to you as my rival. I was&#8230;&#8230;  too proud of my own power &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“O,oh? What&#8217;s wrong, why so sudden?”</p>

<p>Weeg begins to speak abruptly.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure he didn&#8217;t have this kind of personality.</p>

<p>“Let me tell you honestly. I, at that time…… when I was requested to collect the healing water &#8230;&#8230; I didn&#8217;t complete it.”</p>

<p>Weeg&#8217;s clenched fist is discolored white. He seemed to be feeling a sense of disappointment.</p>
<p>I see. I thought it was odd, but I guess Weeg didn&#8217;t accomplish the request.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a terrible thing to say, but Weeg wasn&#8217;t good enough to accomplish that request.</p>

<p>“I was aroused by Byrias. He said  『It&#8217;s a request that no one can really accomplishment. Unlike the barbarians of the guild, you are a prince. I saw that noble heart. You can pretend you&#8217;ve accomplished it. 』 &#8230;&#8230;.or something like that.”</p>
<p>“Wha……! Weeg, what are you talking &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>

<p>Byrias, who is being held back by his feet by the king dragon, shouts angrily at him.</p>
<p>It seems to be true after seeing this reaction.</p>
<p>He originally intended to choose the hero based on one’s status, not to give them a high-difficulty request and not to let them accomplish it. And it was accomplished by me and Quena, and that&#8217;s why he ignored us like that.</p>

<p>“But it&#8217;s been stuck in my chest for a long time. That someone else had achieved it before me. &#8230;&#8230; As I look at the mud containing the healing water that was applied to Byrias &#8230;&#8230; I knew it!”</p>

<p>Weeg&#8217;s voice is rough.</p>
<p>It is as if he is about to throw up all of himself to atone for his sins.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;ve always wondered. Who was it? No, I really knew it. Anyone can tell it by looking at the face of the person who failed. &#8230;&#8230; of course, it’s also the face of the one who succeeded”</p>

<p>Weeg looks at me with a <em>jii</em>.</p>

<p>“No, the one who brought the water contained in that mud was Que &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“I &#8230;&#8230;! I can’t even be a rival of Zeid&#8230;&#8230;!&#8221;</p>

<p>Weeg interrupts me and continues.</p>
<p>This is no good. He doesn&#8217;t seem to be listening to me.</p>

<p>“Prince of Stillbeats. That&#8217;s the same for us.”</p>

<p>From behind Weeg, the other prospective heroes nod their heads in agreement.</p>

<p>“When the dragon herd attacked, I couldn&#8217;t even hold my sword up. All I could think about was running away first. &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“And yet Zeid-san, who was in the audience, was the first to come down here.”</p>
<p>“That overwhelming sense of confidence and responsibility is &#8230;&#8230; very desirable.”</p>

<p>Each hero candidate leaves a word.</p>
<p>I got embarrassed to be told that much.</p>

<p>“I don&#8217;t care what anyone says, I approve of Zeid. I even&#8230;&#8230;. admire him”</p>

<p>Weeg said so.</p>
<p>Then Byrias, who was stuck to the ground, raised his voice.</p>

<p>“I,I don&#8217;t mind admitting him! I forgive you for your rudeness! So free me from this lizard!”</p>
<p>“No, that&#8217;s impossible.”</p>
<p>“Wha……! The,then I&#8217;ll make you a hero! How about it!? If I recommend you, you will be a hero for sure!”</p>
<p>“To make the guy who tries to solve this case by such means a hero &#8230;&#8230; You make me laugh. I thought you said that a Hero is a man of integrity. I think it&#8217;s far from me.”</p>

<p>I laugh to myself.</p>
<p>But Weeg replied to this.</p>

<p>“Certainly, your means aren’t heroic. But you took the burden and saved the Sacred city! Everyone here was cowering and unable to move, and yet &#8230;&#8230;! I think Zeid is a much heroic man than I, who was selected as a candidate by fraud!”</p>

<p>It&#8217;s a serious passionate speech.</p>
<p>The hot look in his eyes was as if he wanted me to become the hero.</p>

<p>“No, well. To be honest, I&#8217;m not interested in being the Hero. I&#8217;m Zeid from the Guild.”</p>
<p>“……! Haha. You’re amazing as expected, Zeid”</p>

<p>It only took a moment for his eyes to widen in surprise. Weeg left with a <em>taking a philosophic view</em> laugh.</p>
<p>I am by no means belittling those who are heroes.</p>
<p>But that doesn&#8217;t mean I admire them.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m just not interested. That&#8217;s my honest feeling.</p>

<p>“Then I&#8217;m going back.”</p>
<p>“Wa,wait……! Guah!”</p>

<p>As I try to turn away, the king dragon lifts Byrias up and puts him in its mouth. It&#8217;s not a <em>sweet </em>bite that an animal child would do.</p>
<p>Sharp fangs penetrate the skin of Byrias.</p>
<p>It would be warm considering his future.</p>

<p>“I,I&#8217;m a heavyweight in the Hero association. &#8230;&#8230;!? If I die &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>

<p>Byrias makes a useless resistance.</p>
<p><em>What is this guy talking about?</em> Does he not understand the situation yet?</p>
<p>Just when I thought it would be a hassle to say something back, Weeg answered for me.</p>

<p>“I sympathize with you on the intervention of the empire, but let’s not mention the blunder that you brought, which cause so much devastation to the divine city. The fact that injustice was rampant in the Hero association cannot be overlooked. The association will have to be renewed or disbanded.”</p>
<p>“Th,the Hero Association has received enormous support from the human race, you just can’t &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“So what. I don&#8217;t know how many bigwigs are behind the association, but have you forgotten the identities of the people here?”</p>

<p>Weeg makes Byrias aware of that.</p>
<p>All of the people that he has gathered —— came from high ranking families. They were all looking at him with hostile eyes.</p>

<p>“Dam……damn it……! Fuuuuuuuuck!”</p>

<p>Byrias&#8217; exclamation echoed through the air.</p>
<p>The king dragon flew away with Byrias in his mouth.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Finally, the request was completed and Quena and I were on our way home.</p>
<p>I got tangled up with various people along the way.</p>

<p>“Zeid-san &#8230;&#8230;! Thank you very much&#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“Come to our country!”</p>
<p>“No, come to our country!”</p>
<p>“Uwah……. Saviour-sama……!”</p>

<p>I was thanked by ordinary people, solicited by the leading figures in the country, and worshipped by a young girl I remembered seeing somewhere.</p>
<p>Which reminds me.</p>
<p>This event was broadcasted live.</p>
<p>Apparently, what was happening on the field was being transmitted to the outside.</p>
<p><em>Is that why they think I saved this country?</em></p>
<p>Among them are.</p>

<p>“Ah…… once more……thank you…… thank you……!”</p>

<p>Like that, some even shed tears.</p>
<p>They probably understood it because I repelled the kingdom that tried to invade the Holy Republic in my previous request.</p>
<p>It doesn&#8217;t feel bad.</p>
<p>But Quena, standing next to me, had such a blank expression on her face that I couldn&#8217;t tell what she was thinking.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>Thinking back, she was silent the whole time.</p>
<p>I think the last time she said a word was when Luina and I were confronting each other.</p>
<p>When I asked, Quena replied in just a few words.</p>

<p>“I have tried.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Hmm. Quena is stronger compared to the other guys.”</p>
<p>“But I wonder if it wasn&#8217;t enough.”</p>
<p>“……Is it about Quena?”</p>

<p>In the end, Luina never called out to Quena. On the contrary, she was never even once in her sights.</p>
<p>Although they’re half-sisters, they look alike. It is proof that they are related by blood.</p>
<p>Yet, she was so cold to her that it was hard to believe that they were sisters.</p>

<p>“Zeid, I&#8217;m jealous of you.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>

<p>That&#8217;s what I expected to be told.</p>
<p>But still, my left chest jumped loudly. It was a topic I did not want to touch.</p>

<p>“You easily attained S rank, easily crushed the power of one nation, easily saved the Sacred city, easily charmed the hero candidates, and easily &#8230;&#8230;—— recognized by Luina “</p>
<p>“…………”</p>

<p>That&#8217;s not sarcasm.</p>
<p>If I had to say something, it would be about sarcasm towards herself.</p>
<p>The corners of her mouth was turn up in self-mockery. Even though her eyes were never smiling.</p>

<p>“What, am I supposed to do &#8230;&#8230;?”</p>

<p>It was a voice which sounded weak for Quena.</p>
<p>She looked up at me and seemed like she was about to cry.</p>

<p>“I don&#8217;t know. If I could see into the future, I&#8217;d be able to give you a sound advice, but I can&#8217;t see that stuff.”</p>
<p>“As expected, if Zeid can see the future, then I’ll even pull back”</p>

<p>Quena laughs jokingly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a somewhat empty smile.</p>

<p>“But, that’s right. I don&#8217;t think Quena should do anything anymore.”</p>
<p>“Eh……?”</p>
<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re strong enough, and if you continue to go down this path, you&#8217;ll be close to S-rank.”</p>
<p>“But, unlike me, you said that you can&#8217;t see the bottom of Bashina&#8230;&#8230;.”</p>
<p>“That was from before. When we fought, I found his bottom.  I&#8217;m sure Quena would pass that guy in a heartbeat. If you keep pushing forward, you&#8217;ll be close.”</p>

<p>I am by no means encouraging her unnecessarily.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s my true feelings, and my assessment of Quena. There is no such thing as favoritism from the beginning.</p>

<p>“……Fufuh”</p>

<p>Quena reacts happily to my words.</p>

<p>This time she made a smile from the bottom of her heart.</p>
<p>Then she looked at me with a beaming expression.</p>

<p>“Then, can you have a party with me?”</p>
<p>“…………where did you get the idea of a party?”</p>

<p>For a moment, I thought that it came from Sheila.</p>
<p>She suggested something similar to me. <em>The second thing she was saying is to get a party together.</em></p>
<p>However, I didn&#8217;t feel the need to have a party and turned it down every time. That hasn&#8217;t changed even now.</p>

<p>“That’s simple. I want to get a tiny share of your profit.”</p>
<p>“A tiny share?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I will bask in the same glory beside you. Then I&#8217;ll naturally get more attention, won&#8217;t I?”</p>

<p>I see.</p>
<p>I honestly got it.</p>
<p>However.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;m sorry, but I’m currently aren&#8217;t recruiting or applying for party members.”</p>
<p>“What if I told you I&#8217;d do anything?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m not recruiting”</p>
<p>“I’ll let you do anything to me, you know?”</p>
<p>“……Yeah”</p>

<p>I was reminded of something and got confused.</p>
<p><em>No, if a beautiful woman tells me she’d do anything &#8230;&#8230; I can&#8217;t refuse.</em></p>
<p>So I desperately try to fix my gaze forward and avoid looking at Quena.</p>
<p><em>It’s probably because I&#8217;m easily lured by their colorful scent. &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>
<p>It was the same with Sheila.</p>
<p><em>At that time, my head seemed to have been punctured and I was dying &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>
<p>What a surprise, I felt a soft hand on my cheek.</p>
<p>My field of vision was taken to Quena&#8217;s face.</p>

<p>“Because I won’t give up”</p>

<p>She got so close that even I could feel her breath. Her serious crimson eyes were staring me.</p>
<p>A voice with an indomitable spirit reached my ears.</p>

<p>“…….Why a party? If it’s you, then you can go solo”</p>
<p>“I can be a solo adventurer. But, I thought it would be a shortcut to form a party with 『you』. At least until I take the S-rank exam, I&#8217;ll let you attack me whenever I have free time,.” <em>
<p>Quena said smirking, with a smile that seemed to blow off somewhere.</p>
<p>Her problems may not have been solved, but it is as if she still found a way forward.</p>
<p>Perhaps the fact that I was recruited by Luina made her see me as the goal point for her.</p>

<img src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/07/1361.jpg"></img>


<p>It’s not just for the glory. She’s trying to learn from me.</p>
<p>Just as I once learned from monsters to survive.</p>
<p><em>……Wait, then that makes it sound like I’m a monster. I don&#8217;t like that.</em></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>5: After the turmoil</strong></p>

<p>After completing the request from the Hero Association, I was called by Riff with my adventurer&#8217;s card to come to the guild master&#8217;s office.</p>

<p>“Heh, the Hero Association is disbanding, huh”</p>
<p>“Umu. Their haughty attitude as of late has become well-known. It seems like this case has exploded at once. In addition, their leader, Byrias, that guy, was taken away by a dragon. The dissidents inside and outside the association are gaining momentum, and the other figureheads have been captured or beaten to a pulp.”</p>

<p>Well, it&#8217;s none of my business when the request is over. <em>I just have the impression that it&#8217;s going to be tough.</em></p>

<p>“So, what is it for me?”</p>

<p>I ask Riff.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t think she has called me in here to tell me about the case of the Hero Association.</p>
<p>If that was the case, she must have a lot of free time.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>Riff seems very bored, so that&#8217;s not out of the realm of possibility.</p>
<p>“Muh. Are you thinking of something rude? …… Well whatever. I invited Zeid this time because I want him to form a 『party』.”</p>
<p>“A party? Is that what Sheila and Quena asked you to do?”</p>

<p>The first thing that came to my mind, was the two girls.</p>
<p>But contrary to my expectations, Riff shakes her head.</p>

<p>“It seems that they are also soliciting Zeid, but this time, it&#8217;s a completely different matter.”</p>
<p>“A different matter? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Umu. Actually, I decided to make a charisma party in the guild with a trifling aim.”</p>
<p>“Cha,charisma?”</p>

<p>I couldn&#8217;t help but asked back as an unfamiliar word for me came up.</p>
<p><em>Charisma, or such words are probably furthest from me. &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>“It&#8217;s the guild&#8217;s version of a &#8220;hero&#8217;s party,&#8221; so to speak.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Isn&#8217;t it something similar to the Hero Association?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ll be frank with you. However, I won&#8217;t borrow the name 『Hero』. I&#8217;m just going to make you stand as a charismatic being.”</p>

<p>Since the Hero Association, which had produced heroes who were the spiritual pillars of the human race, had collapsed, it appears that her intention was to take its place. She wants to attract attention and trust, and strengthen the guild&#8217;s presence.</p>
<p><em>That’s very light footwork.</em></p>

<p>“But why me?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, Zeid has accepted requests that people didn&#8217;t want to accept, and even boldly accepted a request to save a country without hesitation. You’re the talk of the town, and you have a good reputation”</p>
<p>“……Hmm. Well, if it&#8217;s a guild request, then I&#8217;ll accept it.”</p>
<p>“Oh! I knew Zeid would say that! Many of the other S-rank adventures are problematic and carefree, and some of them already have organized a party &#8230;&#8230; aside from temporary parties, an adventurer can belong to only one party. That really helps”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s a story that seems to be a lot of trouble.”</p>

<p>The only other S-rank I know of is Soria, but it sounds like a lot of work.</p>
<p>Besides, it was said that they’re only born once every few years, and their number will probably be limited.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p>“Since you accepted it, you won’t be handled badly. At least, your conditions and treatment will be better.”</p>
<p>“Hoh. That helps”</p>

<p>In fact, I&#8217;ve benefited quite a bit from being an adventurer.</p>
<p>There are discounts for adventurers on lodging, clothing, and meals as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, when crossing a border, unless they are on bad terms with it, they can pass smoothly.</p>
<p>That is, of course, if they go by the regular route. <em>Since though it&#8217;s not that it&#8217;s absolutely necessary; it is because it&#8217;s possible to infiltrate it by force.</em></p>

<p>“So, for the time being, we have decided on Soria and Zeid as the members.”</p>
<p>“Soria huh? She has a busy image, though, is that okay?”</p>
<p>“That’s the thing, since it&#8217;s a charismatic party, after all. Since you fly to areas where skirmishes are fierce, your interests are aligned with those of Soria, whose mission is to save the wounded by healing them. And it&#8217;s not like it&#8217;s an <em>always-on</em> party.&#8221;</p>
<p>“I see”</p>
<p>“Umu. In the first place, this plan will not start without the majesty of Soria.”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><em>Kukuku…… </em>like that, Riff laughs blackly like a dark enemy boss. That gesture was somewhat funny, contradicting her appearance of a young girl.</p>
<p>Originally, Soria was at the level where she had been selected to join the Hero party, skipping over the candidates.</p>
<p>As for the calculations, it seems that they plan to advertise us, taking into account our achievements.</p>

<p>“As for the members, I have already decided on a certain amount of chivalric assistance. Some of them were brought in from outside the guild——“</p>
<p>““Wait a minute!””</p>

<p>Then, just as Riff brought up the subject of new members, the door was opened with a bang, with their voices overtaking each other.</p>
<p>It was Sheila and Quena who entered.</p>

<p>““Why didn’t you tell us the secret!?””</p>

<p>I smile bitterly at the two people who come with great vigor with both hands open at their chest.</p>

<p>“I didn&#8217;t summon you in the first place. If you&#8217;re going to say something, say it to Riff.”</p>

<p>I said, and the two looked at Riff.</p>
<p>Riff scratched her cheeks and began to make excuses with a laugh <em>“tehee”</em>.</p>

<p>&#8220;I knew you two were inviting Zeid. But Quena is A rank, and when it comes to Sheila, she&#8217;s a C. In light of the skipping system, Sheila might get an A rank this year, but still not an S. &#8230;&#8230;”</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>


<p>Although she is being a bit modest, I think what Riff is trying to say is that 『S-rank is a requirement』.</p>
<p>They puff out their cheeks in discontent.</p>

<p>“Then turn it down, Zeid!”</p>

<p>Quena said so.</p>

<p>“That’s right! Team up with me!”</p>

<p>Sheila continued.</p>
<p>And this time, Quena bites at it.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about!? He’s going to team up with me!”</p>
<p>“Muh! It&#8217;s me!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><em>What is this situation?</em></p>
<p>Riff is also smiling amusedly, as if her usual switch has been flipped.</p>
<p>Stop laughing. <em>I wonder if she doesn&#8217;t mind if I join another party.</em></p>
<p>When I was thinking about that, I heard the answer.</p>

<p>“Actually, the Charisma Party is treated as an extra party, so it can be crossed with other parties. There are just a lot of people who don&#8217;t want to hold both of those.”</p>
<p>“Ah……”</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why she was looking at them both with amusement.</p>
<p>This girl had a bad personality as well.</p>
<p>These two people are pressuring me to party with them.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but feel that there would be a lot of work ahead of me.</p>
<p><em>I wish they could understand my feelings about being caught in between.</em></p>
<p>As I was thinking this, <em>boo-boo</em>, the adventurer card rang out. I&#8217;m used to it now and don&#8217;t feel any strangeness about it.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>Another nomination or urgent request must have arrived.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why, my adventurer life still continues.</p>
