︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>1: Becoming an Adventurer in the Guild</strong></p>


<p>“Is this the main building of the guild? ……No, is this one the headquarters, ma’am?”</p>

<p>Riff took me to the guild.</p>
<p>It was a building near the center of the Kingdom of Kuzera, the royal capital.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, it&#8217;s a huge, seven-story structure that looks like it could be able to eat ten whole houses. <em>How much excellent piece of land did they buy up?</em></p>
<p><em>I heard that the closer it is at the royal capital’s center, the higher the land price it would be, though&#8230;&#8230;</em></p>
<p>She can give me a hundred gold coins, so I wonder how much money this organization alone has.</p>

<p>“Umu, that’s splendid! It’s not the main building, but the headquarters. Or rather, don&#8217;t use polite language again, it&#8217;s creepy.”</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s an appearance aspect to it, after all”</p>
<p>“Stop that. That subservient attitude reminds me of those greasy, puffed-up, upstart merchants whom I don&#8217;t understand what they&#8217;re thinking. When they found out that I&#8217;m not a child, they suddenly started grinning, so it&#8217;s creepy.” <em>(TN: It’s called legal loli)</em></p>
<p>“O,oh”</p>

<p>Well, if you say that much to me, I can&#8217;t help but fix it.</p>
<p>In the first place, I don&#8217;t like to use honorifics too much either. <em>Though Riff looks like a child to me.</em></p>

<p>“It must be hard, looking like a kid and all.”</p>
<p>“Really. I was originally a beautiful woman with a nice body&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; See, just like that girl.”</p>
<p>“Originally……? Hoh…… that’s true”</p>

<p>Riff said something that seems to bother her. But more importantly, the woman she pointed to was also a beautiful woman, though I wasn&#8217;t much interested in Riff in the past.</p>
<p>She is a woman who can attract people&#8217;s attention just by her looking at the large bulletin board inside the guild.</p>
<p>She has long fiery red hair, red eyes, and a body with feminine lines. She&#8217;s got a good face, too, so she attracts people&#8217;s attention just by her walking around —— <em>eh, she’s looking this way, right?</em></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>“Somehow, isn’t that person looking this way?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s fine. Let me show you around the guild~”</p>
<p>“No, she’s staring, you know. What’s this, it feels like she’s glaring at us, though.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine. Let&#8217;s get inside. We haven’t been exposed yet.”</p>
<p>“You say some very ominous things. Nevertheless, she’s coming, though, in this way”</p>

<p><em>I guess this girl is what they mean when they say ‘seeing a starving prey’.</em></p>
<p>She was coming straight at us, with a glaring gaze directed in our direction.</p>

<p>“This is bad! Let&#8217;s go, Zeid!”</p>
<p>“Eh? Eh? What, what!”</p>

<p>Riff grabs my hand.</p>
<p>The soft, small hand, that could even barely hold my pinky finger, was overflowed with magic power that created a wind as the aftermath.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>“『Transfer』!”</p>

<p>It was a magic chant.</p>
<p>Moreover, it&#8217;s just a word.</p>
<p>I still didn&#8217;t believe it.</p>
<p>But this little girl has definitely lived for decades. She has that much magic training, and concentrated and dense magic power that I could feel that way.</p>
<p><em>Ah, even I admit it. </em></p>
<p>This is undoubtedly a 『Master』 class of a large organization with branches in many countries.</p>
<p><em>……That’s why, I want you to not glare at me.</em></p>

<p>“I unconsciously did it……”</p>
<p>“Unconsciously, is it?”</p>
<p>“Yes…… my apologies……”</p>

<p>I bow my head lightly in acknowledgement.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>The little girl looks at me with an accusing look.</p>

<p>“You unconsciously…… just repelled my 『Transfer』!”</p>

<p>I repelled the 『Transfer』 magic that she had activated in order to escape from the red-haired beauty.</p>
<p>It’s probably because she was trying to transfer me with her. <em>Since her magic power has clung to me &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>
<p>It&#8217;s kind of like a defense instinct. I want you to forgive me.</p>

<p>“Mumuh, I don&#8217;t think we can get away from her anymore with this”</p>
<p>“Sounds like it.”</p>

<p>The outside and inside of the guild.</p>
<p>Even though we were quite a distance away, the beautiful woman came right in front of us without losing her breath.</p>

<p>“What is it, Quena. What can I do for you?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m not here for you or anything, Riff! That&#8217;s the Zeid guy you have there with you, right!”</p>

<p>The beautiful woman called Quena pointed at me.</p>

<p>“Ah, I&#8217;m Zeid, though”</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>“What is it, did you fall in love with him at first sight?”</p>
<p>“Fa,fall in love at first sight……? Huh! You mean love at first sight!? I,it wasn’t such a thing, you know!”</p>

<p>I was cut down real quick. It hurt my heart because the other person is a beautiful woman.</p>

<p>“Don&#8217;t play dumb, Riff! You&#8217;re going to give him S-rank over me, aren&#8217;t you!?”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, it has already been decided by the discussion, though. Are you still planning to complain about it?”</p>
<p>“You&#8217;re talking about the discussion between the S-ranked people and the guild&#8217;s executives, which almost no one participates in!? Why should we A-ranked people be left out!”</p>
<p>“That’s natural. Do you think that an A-ranked person can have an opinion about S-ranked personnel, which is higher than them?”</p>
<p>“I have no problem if the members in the current A rank are promoted! But, I&#8217;m saying that it&#8217;s weird for a guy who suddenly comes out to instantly become S-rank!”</p>

<p>Apparently, Quena is against me being promoted to S rank.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard this before. Guilds have a rank system, and S rank is the highest rank. It was also said that to become an S-rank adventurer, you need to pass an exam that is held only once a year, and only one person can pass it. <em>Well, I&#8217;ve heard that it&#8217;s only once every few years that it is actually been received, though.</em></p>

<p>“You want me to at least prove myself, don&#8217;t you?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>“That&#8217;s right! The other A-ranked guys won&#8217;t be happy if things continue as they are!”</p>
<p>&#8220;But Zeid has already been recommended by the S-rank Soria Aiden. And from various other executives.”</p>
<p>“【Saint of the Light Star】 Soria Aiden-sama &#8230;&#8230; Well, many adventurers recognized him because she enthusiastically recommended him!”</p>

<p><em>What, it was appointed to me.</em></p>
<p><em>I, from the light star?</em> I&#8217;ve received a recommendation from the saint-sama…&#8230;? And from various other executives as well …&#8230;?</p>
<p><em>I wonder if there were a lot of people who recommended me, and not just Riff.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know why. <em>I&#8217;m sure I don&#8217;t have any connections to be recommended, though.</em></p>

<p>“But…… I still can&#8217;t recognize him until I check him with my own eyes!”</p>
<p>“Haa, you’re still annoyingly complaining, well then, hit him. Go ahead, hit Zeid and kill him.”</p>
<p>“Aren&#8217;t you being too radical!?”</p>

<p>Riff is going to let her take my life so easily.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s very confusing. Quena, please don&#8217;t turn your murderous eyes on me either. Don&#8217;t put your hand on the sword you carry at your waist.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><em>Gacha. (TN: SFX)</em></p>
<p>And then Quena pulled out her sword. What was in the red scabbard, was a red blade that was actually burning. <em>It looks really hot.</em></p>
<p>Or rather, eh?</p>

<p>“Wait a minute. Are we really going to fight? Right here? No, no, people come and go normally here, though”</p>
<p>“No excuses! We just need to not cut up other people or buildings!”</p>
<p>“No, if I hold back, you won&#8217;t be able to see everything that you want to see, right?”</p>
<p>“Guh…… then, let’s do it! Let’s change location!?”</p>

<p>When I answered back, she sulked.</p>
<p><em>Even if you say that we’ll change location……</em></p>

<p>“Then why don&#8217;t you fight in guild style?”</p>
<p>““Guild Style?””</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Quena and I overlapped our words.</p>
<p>Then she pokes at me, with her face as red as her hair and eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t cover my words with yours! It&#8217;s like we&#8217;re on the same page!”</p>
<p>“No, that’s unreasonable.”</p>

<p><em>Is this place black too? Will I be bullied by my seniors? </em></p>

<p>“I&#8217;ll have to explain that to Zeid for the time being. Do you know what you have to do to raise your rank?”</p>
<p>“Aren&#8217;t you supposed to take requests?”</p>
<p>“Umu. It&#8217;s important to take requests. However, to be precise, 『points』 will be given when one fulfills a request.”</p>
<p>“Point, huh”</p>
<p>&#8220;This time, the guild style of competition I mentioned is a match based on those points.”</p>

<p>She then gave a brief explanation.</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>It was about competing for the number of points earned by completing requests.</p>
<p>The date and time are three days from now.</p>
<p><em>I wonder why it’s three days.</em></p>
<p>This was simply what was decided since it would take a long time to complete a high-ranked request.</p>

<p>“<em>Fuhn</em>. I don&#8217;t mind, but this is gonna be my advantage, you know?”</p>
<p>“Hou, why?”</p>
<p>“Because I know more about points than he does. And how to turn over requests smoothly.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s true. You who have climbed up to A rank alone without having a party will be exceptional in ability and know-how compared to others.”</p>
<p>“Fufuhn”</p>

<p>Perhaps because Riff praised her, Quena looked proud.</p>

<p>“However, I thought you could win on that. Zeid”</p>
<p>“Are you sane……?”</p>

<p>“Umu, there is no madness in my eyes.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Well, okay.”</p>

<p>Riff then nodded confidently.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure for me to be trusted so openly. In the chivalric order, I was always told 『There&#8217;s always someone to take your place! 』 or the likes&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>“Ah, that’s right. If Zeid loses, we&#8217;ll pretend that he didn&#8217;t get the S rank, but what if Zeid wins?”</p>
<p>“What? Shouldn’t I just tell everyone that he deserves to be an S rank?”</p>
<p>“Soria has already done that”</p>
<p>“What am I supposed to do then?”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s not for me to decide.”</p>

<p>Riff looked at me as she said this. Being lured, Quena&#8217;s eyes looked at me as well.</p>
<p><em>I see. She wants me to impose the compensation, huh.</em></p>
<p>Well, if I lose, I&#8217;ll be stripped of my title, so I guess that&#8217;s a natural progression.</p>

<p>“Maybe you could be my guide, then?”</p>
<p>“Guide? What&#8217;s that?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m not very familiar with the world, you know, other than the order I was in before. I just listen to my co-workers and catch glimpses of it as we complete our missions. So, I thought I&#8217;d ask you to be my guide for a while.”</p>
<p>“Haa? Well, if that is all, then I don’t particularly mind, though”</p>

<p><em>Is that really fine?</em></p>
<p>Quena was looking at me with a face that was saying so.</p>
<p>No, no, it can&#8217;t be helped, alright. This was what came to my mind.</p>
<p>Besides, I don&#8217;t think it&#8217;s unexpectedly bad. The only thing that would be taken away from Quena would be time, and I wouldn&#8217;t have to worry about anything strange going on out there. Since I could hear a lot of stories about the outside world from her.</p>

<p>“Are you sure that&#8217;s what you want? Quena is saying that she’ll do anything, you know? Something like a man and woman’s <em>mufufu</em>……”</p>
<p>“Wait, I didn&#8217;t say I&#8217;d do anything!?”</p>
<p>“What, do you think you&#8217;re going to lose?”</p>
<p>“No, I don&#8217;t think so!”</p>

<p>“Then, all is well”</p>
<p>“……? Tha,that right. Well, it&#8217;s true&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Eh. Then can I cancel your role of being the guide, and change it to you becoming my woman?”</p>
<p>“No!?”</p>
<p>“What the heck……”</p>

<p>I tried to break in there, but it didn&#8217;t work. Her guard seemed to be tight.</p>
<p><em>Then I shouldn&#8217;t have said that from the beginning &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>

<p>“Then, if I win, the S rank promotion is mine! If Zeid wins, then I&#8217;ll be his guide! Isn&#8217;t that fine!?”</p>
<p>“No. Who said anything about making you an S-rank. We’ll just withdraw Zeid&#8217;s S rank promotion.”</p>

<p>Quena poked her head at Riff&#8217;s quip.</p>
<p><em>She’s cute, but she’s cunning.</em></p>
<p>Or rather, maybe it’s because she wanted to become S rank herself that she’s flaring up at me.</p>
<p>Well, I don&#8217;t see any other reasons in particular, so I guess that&#8217;s about it.</p>
<p>Riff coughed lightly and started it over.</p>

<p>“Then, if Quena wins, Zeid&#8217;s S rank promotion will be revoked, and if Zeid wins, Quena will be Zeid&#8217;s guide. Is that okay”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s fine”</p>
<p>“Ah. I have no problem with that too.”</p>

<p>With the consent of me and Quena, the guild-style points competition has begun.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><em>I wonder which request should I accept.</em> I was thinking about this as I looked at the request forms that were posted in disarray in front of the long bulletin board that ran from one end of the guild to the other.</p>
<p>Next to me is Riff as my advisor.</p>
<p>It seems to be some kind of a handicap for me, who’s an amateur. However, I shouldn’t borrow her powers.</p>
<p>Before the requests, I suddenly have a thought.</p>

<p>“Does she have spare time?”</p>
<p>“What’s with that suddenly”</p>
<p>“I was wondering if she has nothing better to do since she’s suddenly having me do a match and taking care of me.”</p>
<p>“Are you talking about Quena? Ah, since that girl thinks that winning this will bring her closer to S rank. In the first place, she was close to S among the A ranks from the beginning. She has been busy with some nominated requests, you know?”</p>

<p><em>Hou.</em></p>
<p>A nominated request is probably like receiving a request literally by the requester&#8217;s nomination.</p>
<p>Well, she seems to be obsessed with being S rank, but from the public&#8217;s point of view, even an A rank is a place out of reach &#8230;&#8230; that’s what I’ve also heard.</p>
<p>She&#8217;s probably a great woman, too. <em>I don&#8217;t know that, though</em>.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;m talking about you, too, you know. I thought you were supposed to be in charge of this organization.”</p>
<p>“Tentatively, that’s correct”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230; I&#8217;m not saying that you&#8217;re great, I&#8217;m saying that you have a lot of spare time, don’t you. That&#8217;s why, it&#8217;s not something you can puff up with pride, right?”</p>

<p>Riff turns up her nose in a pompous manner, with her flat little girl-like chest.</p>

<p>“I have excellent subordinates, so there is no problem. Rather than that, have you decided which request to get”</p>
<p>“Is that something that can be done so lightly &#8230;&#8230;?”</p>

<p><em>What a pretty irresponsible guild master.</em></p>
<p>I’m wondering now if it was really safe to enter this kind of place. No, well, I don&#8217;t belong to the guild, and adventurers are just subcontractors, so I should consider it better.</p>
<p>Well, nonetheless.</p>
<p>The receptionist and the staff members who I occasionally see seemed to be lively and happy.</p>
<p>At least, unlike the order where I was in, there were no dying people who could be mistaken for zombies.</p>
<p><em>It must have a good environment, this place.</em></p>
<p>Now then, it&#8217;s the request.</p>
<p>There are countless requests posted on the board. These ranged from things that even a child could do, such as picking herbs or defeating goblins, to things that required a higher rank, such as destroying an Orc settlement or fetching a Fenrir&#8217;s hair.</p>
<p>However……</p>

<p>“Hmm, none of them makes sense to me”</p>
<p>“Hou, then let me tell you”</p>

<p>As a rough guide,</p>


<p>F rank request is 1 point</p>
<p>E rank request is 3 points</p>
<p>D rank request is 5 points</p>
<p>C rank request is 10 points</p>
<p>B rank request is 30 points</p>
<p>A rank request is 50 points</p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p><strong> </strong></p>
<p>It was something like that.</p>
<p>However, there was no S rank, which is the most essential.</p>
<p>I also feel that the number of A rank is small.</p>

<p>“Is there any other place you can post the requests?”</p>
<p>“This is all we have at the headquarters. And then there&#8217;s nothing but nominations and urgent requests that come in.”</p>
<p>“Is that so……”</p>

<p>I suppose that’s true.</p>
<p>Even just looking at the few A-rank requests that are posted, it is at a level that can destroy a village.</p>
<p>Such requests cannot be done at a mad pace. <em>It&#8217;s no wonder that there is not a single S rank located above it.</em></p>
<p>And above all, this is the royal capital. It&#8217;s the heart of the kingdom.</p>
<p>Most of the places have been reclaimed and the Knights&#8217; eyes are shining on it&#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p><em>Wait a minute.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“If it&#8217;s in a remote area or something, are there any S-rank requests?”</p>
<p>“That’s a good point of view. However, if it’s in a remote area, there&#8217;s no one rich enough to pay for the request fee. That&#8217;s why, there are even branches that don&#8217;t even have A rank.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that too easy-going”</p>

<p>As I was lazily thinking about it, the guys who were forming a party took a few A rank requests.</p>

<p>“Ah, there’s an A rank”</p>
<p>“What are you going to do, then, there are some people who come to the Royal Capital to earn some money. The requests are limited.”</p>
<p>“That’s true. I&#8217;d better get going.”</p>

<p>Quena had already left the guild with a request.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have time to dawdle either.</p>

<p>“By the way, Quena took one A-rank and two B-ranks.”</p>
<p>“Eh. Is such a thing possible?”</p>
<p>“Simultaneous request acceptance is allowed with special approval. It was because Quena has gained our trust.”</p>
<p>“Can I do that?”</p>
<p>“Even though I approve of your abilities, since Zeid has never experienced fulfilling requests before, it&#8217;s going to be tough.”</p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p><em>So that&#8217;s what Quena was talking about when she said advantage, huh&#8230;&#8230;.</em></p>
<p>Thinking like that, as a newcomer, it puts me at a disadvantage.</p>
<p><em>If it already happens like this, I guess I&#8217;ll just go ahead and accept requests without thinking anything about it.</em></p>

<p>“Hah, I&#8217;ve only slept for three hours this week.”</p>

<p>While grumbling, I took the highest point request from the bulletin board for the time being.</p>




<p>Three days had passed since the day that Zeid, Riff, and Quena had made their agreement.</p>
<p>The only ones there were the receptionist, the eager newcomers, and the guild master, Riff.</p>
<p>The door in the guild is opened and Quena comes in.</p>
<p>It was just in time for the promise.</p>
<p>But, there was no sign of Zeid.</p>
<p>Riff, noticing Quena, waved and called out to her.</p>

<p>“Oh, you&#8217;re back. It&#8217;s been three days.”</p>
<p>“Yeah. One A-rank and two B-ranks were tough as expected. I didn&#8217;t even have time to go back to the guild.”</p>
<p>“So you&#8217;ve really accomplished a lot in the last three days huh”</p>
<p>“Did you think it was impossible?”</p>
<p>“To be honest, I thought that with that rank, the number of people required, and the time it would take, it would only be possible for someone with a party of A ranks.”</p>
<p>“Are you suspecting me of being a fraud?”</p>
<p>“Hahhahha, if you had done that, I would have already seen through it, little girl.”</p>
<p>“Tha,that’s a very harsh thing to hear. Well, I&#8217;ll take that as your trust in me, though.”</p>
<p>“I trust you, you know. Even so, achievement report for all three requests huh~, that must feel good.”</p>

<p>Quena pulls out huge horns and fangs from the burlap sack, that she was holding, which has the size of a fist.</p>
<p>The burlap sack is a magic item, and it can store contents that cannot be imagined from the outside.</p>
<p>What Quena took out from there were monster horns and fangs.</p>
<p>She had already presented the request to the client, and she also had the document she had received from the client, which was the proof that her request had been fulfilled, and she took it out and handed it to the receptionist.</p>
<p>In other words, it was the report of the request’s accomplishment and the sale of the monsters&#8217; parts.</p>
<p>Both of which were instantly redeemed by her.</p>
<p>After a while, the receptionist handed her thirteen gold coins and twenty-seven silver coins.</p>
<p>But there was something else that Quena mentioned before the money.</p>

<p>“110 points, right”</p>
<p>“Oh, that in three days, huh”</p>

<p>Riff&#8217;s eyes widened.</p>
<p>It’s one of the conditions for taking the exam to be promoted from A rank to S rank. The total number of points must exceed 10,000.</p>
<p>It seems like an endlessly long road, but if Quena can keep up her pace this time, even an amateur who starts with the lowest rank of F will be able to take the S rank promotion exam by the end of the year.</p>

<p>“A request isn’t the only way to earn points, but Quena is already capable of challenging for S rank with just requests.”</p>
<p>“That’s natural. Most of my current accumulated points are from requests.”</p>

<p>Quena tells so a little proudly.</p>
<p>Quena&#8217;s accumulated points are already among the highest in A ranks. Although some people have been counter-stopped, it&#8217;s just a few. Moreover, they are not able to move up to S rank, but are stuck in A rank.</p>
<p>Considering these aspects, Quena was the person with the best chance of being promoted among the A-ranks.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why, she has been showing her rebelliousness to Zeid, who easily overtaken Quena and snatched the S rank. &#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>“More importantly, where&#8217;s Zeid? The promise should be until today. Any requests fulfilled after this day will not be valid, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah, of course. There’s no favoritism.”</p>
<p>“Then maybe he ran away?”</p>
<p>“Kuku. Isn&#8217;t there anything else that feels out of place?”</p>
<p>“Feels out of place?”</p>

<p>Riff softened her expression with a little mischievous grin. Quena then looked around while lowering one eyebrow.</p>
<p><em>Did he bring some huge monster with him after defeating it? </em></p>
<p><em>Are there clots of blood somewhere? No, there’s none at all.</em></p>
<p><em>The headquarters, the face of the guild, is kept clean, so such filth is always removed.</em></p>
<p><em>Then, maybe he&#8217;s already in the guild?</em></p>
<p><em>No, there is no sign of Zeid.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“What was it, there was nothing in particular. Maybe he really did run away because he couldn&#8217;t get any requests. &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;——there are…… no requests……?”</p>

<p>Quena&#8217;s face paled.</p>
<p><em>Tsuu! </em>Then a bead of sweat ran down from her forehead to her cheeks.</p>
<p>Her cheeks that had been lifted in an attempt to make fun of him became stiff.</p>
<p>The bulletin board that Quena pointed with her finger ———— has a far less number of requests than usual.</p>

<p>“Wha,what does this mean!? Did everyone suddenly get motivated!?”</p>
<p>“Fuhfuhfu, you&#8217;ve noticed, huh. And don&#8217;t you dare run away from reality. There’s no way anyone could suddenly get motivated, you know. Well, they were inspired by a few parties, but&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, &#8220;inspired&#8221;!? Because this is &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>

<p><em>The number of requests that have decreased is not just one or ten.</em></p>
<p><em>It’s hundreds or thousands—— it’s at that level!</em></p>

<p>“Perhaps, are you saying that Zeid did this!? All the A rank requests are gone&#8230;&#8230; B and C ranks too! All that&#8217;s left are D rank or lower, isn’t it! Moreover, they’re quite scarce&#8230;&#8230;&#8221;</p>
<p>“Hahhahha. Thanks to that, many adventurers have left the royal capital. Complaining things like 『there’s no work here, though! 』”</p>

<p>Riff smiled with amusement as she recalled that time.</p>

<p>“Then Zeid really……!? But how? Is that, even physically possible &#8230;&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“He started out taking them one at a time. However, when he completed ten of them in just one hour, the receptionist also gave him special approval. He has been taking care of a whole region&#8217;s worth of requests since he was granted special approval.”</p>
<p>“What, that’s……”</p>

<p>Perhaps because of a back injury, or because she was exhausted every day, Quena collapsed from her feet.</p>

<p>“To be honest, I didn&#8217;t expect it either. For the past three days, I haven&#8217;t seen him eat or sleep.”</p>
<p>“He fulfilled all those requests in such a state!?</p>
<p>“Umu. What a ridiculous guy. Hahahahaha!”</p>
<p>“No, no…… is he really human…… that can’t be imitated, even in the S rank of the uninhabited area(ominous place outside the human world)&#8230;&#8230;”</p>

<p>Quena dropped the burlap sack that she was holding.</p>
<p>It must have been such a shock to her.</p>

<p>“The,then, where did Zeid go? Don&#8217;t tell me he’s still on a request?”</p>
<p>“No, no, after completing a series of requests, he said, 『Now there won&#8217;t be any requests for Quena to take! Hahaha! 』 and went to stay at the inn.”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t remember him being that kind of character&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“If he doesn’t sleep, then his head is going to be strange, you know. That&#8217;s all there is.”</p>
<p>“I mean, the idea of him getting another request is terrifying. Hmm, but that&#8217;s right. As expected, if he has worked for three consecutive days, he would want to sleep &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not exactly three days.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“I heard that in the chivalric order, he worked for a week and only slept for three hours.” <em>(TN: The very definition of overworking)</em></p>
<p>“Eh!? So he worked for another three days until the headquarters ran out of requests!?”</p>
<p>“That’s why I have told you. I didn&#8217;t expect it either!”</p>

<p>While already having fun so, Riff convulsed with laughter.</p>
<p>She also admired Zeid for completing the requests so easily. She was so surprised that she could only burst out laughing.</p>

<p>“A,ahaha……”</p>

<p>Quena also smiled. With a dry smile.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>I wake up with the sun.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if it was about yesterday evening when I finished all the requests and went to bed. </em></p>
<p>I took a lodging and went to sleep when Riff said, 『Quena can&#8217;t catch up with this point difference physically anymore』.</p>
<p>As expected, my lack of sleep had reached its limit.</p>
<p>I start washing my face and the birds finally start singing.</p>
<p>It was the usual sight.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m feeling rather refreshed, having slept more than usual.</p>
<p>Me waking up like that —— I was feeling guilty about it.</p>
<p>I went outside and wondered if it was really okay to be so lazy.</p>
<p>Then, I headed to Quena&#8217;s house, which Riff had told me about. It was a luxurious single-house in the center of the Royal Capital, near the guild. I then rang its chime.</p>

<p>“……Are you stupid enough to be up at this hour?”</p>

<p>Quena scolded me, rubbing her half-open eyes in her nightwear.</p>

<p>“What time is it, isn&#8217;t it morning? It&#8217;s normal to wake up at this time, even if you&#8217;re only getting a minute&#8217;s sleep.”</p>
<p>“No, no, no, it’s only when you’re a slave. There&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s normal. Rather, it&#8217;s just fine for us adventurers to wake up at noon.”</p>
<p>“Is such a thing allowed……”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, how can such an old slavery system be tolerated?”</p>

<p>Quena pointed out with an amazed look.</p>
<p>In the chivalric order, it has been going on calmly……<em>no way.</em></p>

<p>“Or rather, what are you here for?”</p>
<p>“I was thinking of asking you to be my guide.”</p>
<p>“……At this time?”</p>
<p>“Yeah”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t remember being asked to be a slave, though……”</p>
<p>“Now I feel sorry to be informed of that, I think.”</p>

<p>In fact, I somehow realized that Quena wasn&#8217;t the only one who wanted to sleep.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/qjhmBYN/178711.jpg"></img>

<p>There weren’t many people walking in the street. Only one or two people passed behind me as I stood in the doorway.</p>

<p>“Besides, what am I supposed to do as a guide? Is it okay if I give you a tour of the Royal Capital?”</p>
<p>“Well, that&#8217;s about it. Also, I&#8217;d like to know what Quena was talking about, that 『how to roll a request』.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Fuhn, well, that’s cheaper than a tour of the Royal Capital, you know. When it came to how to roll a request, it seems that Zeid was already able to do it naturally.”</p>
<p>“I have done it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Riff told me that you’ve kind of 『took and assimilated requests from a whole area』. Also, if you see some herbs, pick them up even if you don&#8217;t need them, to fulfill the guild&#8217;s request to collect herbs. That&#8217;s about it.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I see.”</p>

<p>It looks like a rough job of special recognition, but it seems to be convenient that anyone can practice with medicinal herbs.</p>
<p>However, she also said, &#8220;Well, picking herbs is only for D rank. I don&#8217;t see any adventurers above C rank doing that”.</p>

<p>“Then, well, come again around noon.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“If you want me to show you around the royal capital, you have to do it at a time when everyone is awake. It doesn&#8217;t make sense now. Besides, I&#8217;m sleepy. &#8230;&#8230;Fuhaa”</p>

<p>She stretched out her body and yawned.</p>
<p>The lines of her body sticking to her thin nightwear were wonderful.</p>

<p>“Then I&#8217;ll see you at noon, so please.”</p>
<p>“Ye~s. Good night~”</p>

<p>With that, Quena went back into her house.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m jealous of her being able to sleep even when the sun had risen.</p>
<p>Even if I were to crawl into my softly wrapped bed now, and the sky is dark and there is no sound, I’m sure I wouldn’t be able to sleep.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a habit I&#8217;ve developed over the years.</p>
<p><em>I&#8217;m afraid for my eyelids to close.</em></p>
<p>So with that —— I guess I&#8217;ll just work until noon.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>“……are you, kidding me”</p>

<p>Quena was looking at me with reproachful eyes.</p>
<p>Her gaze hurts.</p>

<p>“I feel bad”</p>
<p>“No…… Why would you perform a request up to near evening! What about your promise with me!? Why do I have to go all the way to this forest to find you!”</p>

<p>Quena&#8217;s voice echoed through the entire forest.</p>
<p>The nearby birds scurried away.</p>

<p>“You misunderstand it in the guild…… How can you be in here this late? You&#8217;ll usually realize it sooner.”</p>
<p>“Well, whenever there’s job left to do, I just feel like I have to get it done.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not a job, it&#8217;s a request, a.re.quest! It&#8217;s up to you whether you want to take it or not!”</p>

<p>Quena points her index finger and nails it at me many times.</p>

<p>“That&#8217;s not what I&#8217;m trying to say. If I don&#8217;t take it, the contract money I received from Riff won&#8217;t mean anything.”</p>
<p>“Contract money, is it…… you didn&#8217;t sign up for anything, right? Actually, that&#8217;s more of a transfer fee, you know.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, when I got my S rank card, I was told to accept as many requests as possible, though”</p>
<p>“As many requests as possible!? That&#8217;s what they all say! You can&#8217;t expect them telling you to take everything!”</p>

<p>Quena complains while holding her head.</p>
<p><em>She’s not a guild employee, so why is she even thinking about their job,</em> is what I thought.</p>

<p>“Listen, okay? Most of the adventurers have disappeared from Royal Capital because you&#8217;ve completed all the requests from A rank to C rank. If an S-rank-sama works any longer, the jobs of the people below them will disappear! Think about the balance. Besides, you wouldn&#8217;t benefit from anything less than A-rank money and achievements.”</p>

<p>I see.</p>
<p><em>She had her own reasons too, didn&#8217;t she? </em>It’s the opinion of an adventurer, not of the guild staff.</p>
<p>She’s saying that if I don&#8217;t stop, I&#8217;ll consume all the requests. If that happens, she&#8217;ll have to change location as well. I guess that&#8217;s what being an adventurer is all about.</p>
<p>Quena has her own home, which makes it difficult for her to change the location of her activities, so she’s probably thinking of refraining from doing so.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;m sorry about that. I wasn&#8217;t considerate enough.”</p>
<p>“No…… you&#8217;re honest, very much so.”</p>

<p>Quena&#8217;s face looked like she has lost interest in it.</p>

<p>“Well, whatever. Then, as promised, I’ll give you a tour of the royal capital.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure? It&#8217;s almost evening.”</p>
<p>“Yes. Even if it isn’t daytime, the royal capital is fun even at night.”</p>

<p>Quena said happily, looking quite enthusiastic.</p>
<p><em>In the meantime…… am I being accepted?</em></p>

<p>“I see. But first, let me meet with my client and report my accomplishment.”</p>
<p>“…………………… I understand.”</p>

<p>Following Quena&#8217;s back, I dragged a large number of goblin corpses that I had tied up with a rope.</p>
<p>She smiled bitterly, as if she has been defeated, but it was something trivial.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>“This is a first-class restaurant. You have to make a reservation for the superior dragon steak, but it may be served normally. They are also a purveyor to the royal family.”</p>
<p>“If you&#8217;re looking for weapons and stuff, this is the place. They&#8217;ve even had well-known and stalwart men come all the way from afar.”</p>
<p>…………</p>
<p>……</p>
<p>Like that, I was taught various places.</p>
<p>However,</p>

<p>『……the meat …… is delicious, but…… my stomach is rejecting it&#8230;&#8230;! 』</p>

<p>I remember that its fat was so good that my stomach was surprised and my body couldn&#8217;t stop twitching.</p>

<p>『I&#8217;m sorry! I was slashing so hard that I broke the forge! 』</p>

<p>Just by me swinging my sword, the smithy was cut into two. It was fortunate that I didn’t hit anyone.</p>

<p>“……Haa”</p>

<p>Quena is holding her forehead and letting out a sigh. It’s like she’s saying that her head hurts.</p>
<p><em>No, I&#8217;m aware of that, too.</em></p>
<p>I asked her to be my guide, but it didn&#8217;t go well.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;m sorry, I&#8217;m not really cut out for high-class places.”</p>
<p>“I had a sneaking suspicion that it was the case. But that&#8217;s not good enough, you know. An S-rank has to have an S-rank status. Since even your clients will be of higher quality.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, when I was having a match for points against Quena, many of the A-rank requests were commissioned by wealthy merchants. It didn&#8217;t feel like they were of high stature because they yelled at me, though.”</p>
<p>“I’ve heard that, you know. It&#8217;s because you barged in on them in the middle of the night to get the document to accomplish your request, right? It seems you&#8217;ve been running around all night.”</p>
<p>“Eh, that’s because, I heard you could turn in your achievement papers any time.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s one way to do it, but for the time being, please consider the client&#8217;s circumstances. Since it would be a hassle if someone who can make an A-rank request makes a complaint.”</p>
<p>“This is also a business huh”</p>

<p>If so, I&#8217;ll have to get used to it &#8230;&#8230; is it?</p>
<p>However, a high-class restaurant costs 30 silver coins per meal, and a top-class blacksmith costs 30 gold coins per sword.</p>

<p>“The more I get used to it, the scarier it gets&#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“If you&#8217;re going to be doing this, at least endure it.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Yes……”</p>

<p>With tears in my eyes, I nodded.</p>
<p>I see, that&#8217;s right. Come to think of it, this is work, too &#8230;&#8230;. Then I have no choice but to do it.</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s okay. Since I&#8217;ll force myself to get used to it. If I think of the good food as poison, it will taste good, and even a sword that cuts strangely will be fine if I hold it carefully.</p>

<p>“Hey, Zeid. Even so”</p>
<p>“?”</p>
<p>“If you really hate it, you don&#8217;t have to do it. Since there are things that people can&#8217;t do, and things that they&#8217;re not suited for. Adventurers have a lot of freedom in that regard.”</p>
<p>“Is that, okay? Because they said, &#8220;Don&#8217;t use the word &#8216;hate&#8217; even if it kills you”. It was said that I was spoiled if I can&#8217;t do that.”</p>
<p>“……So it&#8217;s really the story of when. You probably aren’t a resident when you became a slave, are you”</p>
<p>“Not exactly&#8230;&#8230;” <em>(TN: She’s basically saying that if Zeid was a slave from the start)</em></p>

<p>Quena was taken aback.</p>
<p>Ah, it’s not good. <em>She’s tearing up.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“You&#8217;re a good woman, aren&#8217;t you”</p>
<p>“Wha,what the heck, that’s disgusting! This is what it means to be a guide, you know”</p>
<p>“Well, I was expecting a mechanical explanation.”</p>

<p>I defended myself from Quena, who was poking me with a red face, and looked at the stalls that were open in the street. A good smell then tickled my nose and my stomach growled.</p>

<p>“What is, that?”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s Bifborn meat skewers.”</p>
<p>“It looks good &#8230;&#8230; I want to eat it …&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Eh? If you want to eat it, you can. You can buy one with one copper coin.”</p>
<p>“No, but ………… Ah”</p>

<p>That&#8217;s right. It wasn&#8217;t in my head.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m an adventurer now, and I can eat freely. I’m even full of money. Recalling that, my feet turned to the stall.</p>

<p>“Uhmm”</p>

<p>I went in front of the old man at the stall.</p>
<p>What should I do in this situation?</p>
<p>At the time I was allowed to go out a few years ago…… No, I wanted to eat at a stall, but I had spent all my money at the cafeteria.</p>
<p><em>I don’t know…… how to do this.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“Haa, it can&#8217;t be helped. Please give us five for now.”</p>
<p>“Alright, it’s five copper coins”</p>

<p>Quena paid the money, and the old man at the stall handed her a bag of skewers.</p>
<p><em>I was a little impressed by the series of actions&#8230;&#8230;!</em></p>

<p>“Yes, here is one gold coin”</p>
<p>“Oh, thank you!”</p>

<p>I then took a gold coin out of my burlap sack and offered it to Quena.</p>
<p>However, Quena withdrew her hand without taking it.</p>

<p>“Hey, what seriously is that?”</p>
<p>“Eh? No, it&#8217;s like your commission…&#8230;”</p>
<p>“No, no, even if that&#8217;s the case, there&#8217;s no way I would get a gold coin as expected! Do you understand the value of this?”</p>

<p>Quena asked me with a somewhat angry expression on her face.</p>
<p>I understand how the value of money works. However, I have few opportunities to actually spend money and touch them.</p>

<p>“If you ask me, then it&#8217;s easy to give it&#8230;&#8230; I guess?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. With that, I can&#8217;t leave you alone.”</p>

<p>She puts her hands on her hips and looks stunned.</p>
<p><em>I’m ashamed…… </em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“Then, yes. You’ll have three. And the two are mine.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. So how much do I have to pay you?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, it’s just this much. I&#8217;ll give it to you.”</p>
<p>“Eh…… I don&#8217;t feel comfortable to have asked you to show me around while you buying me food.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s why you were being used for their own purposes. Be a little more dignified. Benefit is the most important thing.”</p>
<p>“Tha,that’s right, isn’t it…… <em>Hagu </em>…… delicious!!”</p>

<p>I ate the meat skewer that Quena had given me.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s crunchy on the outside and tender on the inside&#8230;&#8230;! The entanglement of sauce and fat remains in my mouth, and the scent tickles my nose &#8230;&#8230;!</p>
<p><em>Delicious!!!</em></p>

<p>“Are you even listening to me? That level of <em>change of mind </em>is fast……”</p>

<p>It seems that Quena was shocked yet again, but more importantly, the meat skewer is delicious. The content of her talk flows from my right ear to the left.</p>

<p>“I wasn’t listening much! Since it&#8217;s too good!”</p>
<p>“Wait a moment. Pull yourself together! With that sort of……”</p>
<p>“<em>Mogumogu. </em>No…… it’s okay”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“The other day, while looking at the clients. I&#8217;ve changed my mind about a lot of things.”</p>
<p>“? What do you mean”</p>
<p>&#8220;The old man blacksmith said, 『Ah, no more, it’s time to stop. Even if I continue now, I won&#8217;t be able to make anything good! There&#8217;s no point in working on a day like this! 』, even though he seems to be insanely severe. Ah, certainly, I thought there&#8217;s no point in continuing if I&#8217;m poor at it.”</p>
<p>“Heh”</p>
<p>“The <em>obaa-san</em> at the inn was cleaning even though there were no adventurers left and no one was around, and I was wondering if there was any point in doing so, then she said 『——Yes, it&#8217;s true that there&#8217;s no one here, but if I clean it up tidily, it gives me a firm feeling, and a boost for tomorrow.』. I hadn&#8217;t really thought about cleaning before, but now it seemed like a good idea.”</p>
<p>“Work isn&#8217;t something you&#8217;re made to do, it&#8217;s something you do.” <em>(TN: This basically sums up the whole point of their conversation)</em></p>
<p>“Ah, that’s true”</p>

<p><em>So I realized once again how vicious of an environment the Order has, where everything was forced upon you. </em></p>
<p><em>And how free of an occupation the adventurers have.</em></p>

<p>As I was thinking about this ——my adventurer card quivered, while emitting a low sound.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>Guild card.</p>
<p>Also known as an adventurer&#8217;s card.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s square and big enough to hold in my fist. It seems to come in a variety of colors, but mine is black, and the texts are white.</p>
<p>With it, I can view my status, requests that are posted on the board, and even make a reservation for a request.</p>
<p>And I was told that there are three reasons why a guild card rings.</p>
<p>The first was, it being a call from the guild. If I violated a rule, or something like that which needed to talk about.</p>
<p>The second was, a nominated request. The meaning remains the same; the guild will contact me if I was nominated by a client.</p>
<p>And this time, it&#8217;s the third one.</p>
<p>An emergency request.</p>
<p>It’s up to the adventurer to decide whether or not to accept the request, just like a normal request.</p>
<p>However, if you don&#8217;t accept it, your points will be deducted and you may even be demoted in rank.</p>

<p>“A massive outbreak of monsters in the Holy Republic, right”</p>

<p>Quena was looking at her card as well. There was no sound or vibration from it. It could be set arbitrarily. It is in order to avoid being disturbed by vibrations or sounds while executing a request.</p>

<p>“It&#8217;s an S rank request. And the amount of completion money is quite high.”</p>
<p>“The Holy Republic is a neutral country with a lot of money going around, right. Besides, in emergencies like this, people would jointly contribute their money.”</p>
<p>“Is that so. Nn, and then there&#8217;s this travel allowance.”</p>

<p>The content displayed on the card was 『Travel Allowance: 10 silver coins from the Kuzera Kingdom to the Holy Republic』.</p>

<p>“Ah, that&#8217;s the guild&#8217;s compensation.”</p>
<p>“Eh, I could get paid for just moving? Our step is a step for the country &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about? You&#8217;re not planning on walking to get there, are you? You&#8217;re supposed to go by carriage, you know. It would take a day to get from the Kingdom to the Holy Republic. Besides, it&#8217;s a round trip, so it would be less”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah &#8230;&#8230;”</p>

<p>I miss the days when we had to march even after dawn.</p>
<p><em>Defeat the monsters that attacked me while adjusting my eyes at night in a fatigued state&#8230;&#8230;.</em></p>
<p><em>Ah, those were fun times&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230;.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“Hey, what are you crying for?”</p>
<p>“……Well, I was just indulging in my memories. Hahaha &#8230;&#8230;”</p>

<p>I let out a dry laugh.</p>
<p>For the time being, I pour my magic power into the area displayed as “Accept Request”.</p>

<p>“Zeid, you’re taking this request?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes?”</p>
<p>“You don’t especially need to go out on such a far place, right? For your point.”</p>
<p>“No, no, I have to carry out the work I received.”</p>
<p>“You said you got it&#8230;&#8230; Well, I don&#8217;t have any requests booked either, and I&#8217;m not sure if Zeid can handle it alone, so I&#8217;ll take it.”</p>

<p>Quena traced her adventurer card. She seemed to have accepted the request as well as I did.</p>
<p>If she has the freedom to refuse, she also has the freedom to accept. It could be thought of as opposites.</p>
<p>I am grateful to the organization called Guild. Because if I had worked like before, I would definitely have been destroyed.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I can&#8217;t be too dedicated and let myself crumble on my own.</p>
<p>Knowing this, I accepted the request. But, I didn&#8217;t expect Quena to come with me.</p>

<p>“You don&#8217;t have to guide me there &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“This isn&#8217;t because I lost the game, you know! I just can&#8217;t normally leave you alone!”</p>

<p>After she said so, Quena turned away.</p>
<p>Umu. Well, it&#8217;s a welcoming story, and I&#8217;d better appreciate it&#8230;&#8230; right?</p>

<p>“You’re being very kind to me even though you said that I should focus on my own interests.”</p>
<p>“Do,don’t honestly say such things! It&#8217;s embarrassing!”</p>

<p>She poked me while turning her face bright red.</p>

<p>“Let&#8217;s go, then. First, we have to arrange for a carriage.”</p>
<p>“A carriage? Ah, but since we’re not that far to the Republic, wouldn&#8217;t it be faster to walk?”</p>
<p>“……You should stop thinking that way, you know. The only people who can keep up with you are also inhumane being.”</p>
<p>“……?”</p>

<p>Well, certainly in the Order, I was told to walk so as not to leave the rest behind.</p>
<p>There was not simply a connection &#8230;&#8230; I wonder if it’s because they couldn&#8217;t keep up with me. However, Rande, the leader of the First Chivarlric Order, said, 『It&#8217;s not because I can&#8217;t keep up with you! It’s in order to avoid mission errors in the estimated time of arrival&#8230;&#8230;&#8211; 』 or something like that.</p>
<p>Umu?</p>
<p>Oh well. I guess I&#8217;d better use the carriage now since I&#8217;ve been given a travel allowance.</p>

<p>“Ah, speaking of which”</p>

<p>Quena clapped her hands as if remembering something.</p>

<p>“Soria Aiden-sama, the 【Saint of the Light Star】 who strongly recommended you, is the first priest of the Astea religion, the state religion of the Holy Republic. Maybe, she’s there.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, is that so. Or rather, although she’s a priest, she’s an adventurer?”</p>
<p>“Yes. I&#8217;ve heard that due to a large number of monsters or interspecies conflicts at that time, the guild side sent out requests to her for her healing system, and before anyone knew it, she became S rank. I heard that it took her only a little over a year since the points of each of her requests are so large.”</p>
<p>“Heh, that&#8217;s amazing.”</p>
<p>“……Are you being sarcastic? You got it in a day, you know.”</p>

<p>Quena looks at me with reproachful eyes.</p>

<p>“Since in my case, it&#8217;s a recommendation. I think it&#8217;s amazing that Soria got promoted through the regular route.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Even if it wasn’t through a recommendation, you wouldn&#8217;t need a week &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Hahhahhah, that&#8217;s impossible. Since there won’t be requests anymore.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s true……”</p>

<p>Quena goes in front of me while saying “Well, whatever&#8230;&#8230;”. <em>I guess she is planning to arrange a carriage.</em></p>
<p>I went next to Quena in a short run, trying not to get left behind by her.</p>
<p><em>The Holy Republic, huh.</em></p>
<p>Come to think of it, a long time ago, that was the country I went to protect on an expedition with the chivalric order. It was because we’re allies. But I don&#8217;t remember much in detail about it.</p>
<p>Well, if I ever meet Soria, I&#8217;ll have to thank her.</p>
<p>It was thanks to her strong recommendation that I was able to join the guild and had the opportunity to get out of the chivalric order.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>We arrived at a major city of the Holy Republic.</p>
<p>Apparently, this isn’t its central city, but its scale isn’t small and it has the size and landscape that can be compared with the royal capital.</p>
<p>A large bronze statue of a goddess was erected in the square near the center.</p>
<p>The statue looks like a beautiful woman holding a cane. It’s huge but not intimidating, and it seems to have the capacity to accept everything.</p>

<p>『All adventurers who have accepted the guild&#8217;s request, please gather here!! 』</p>

<p>The knights of the Holy Republic were gathering near the statue.</p>
<p>Yes, the statue here was the meeting place for the adventurers. Quena was also here next to me.</p>

<p>“……you’re, still eating”</p>
<p>“Nmuh. It’s as delicious as the skewers of the royal capital.”</p>

<p>Quena looks at my way with a scolding gaze.</p>
<p>It was still too early for the meeting time, so I bought some meat skewers from a street stall. I think what makes it different from the Royal Capital was the taste. This is fatty meat, but I could gulp it down. Its flavor was refreshing. <em>For this reason, I have gone the extra mile. &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>

<p>“Ah, you want some?”</p>
<p>“No, no. Don&#8217;t give me that 『I don&#8217;t want to share it &#8230;&#8230; 』 look. Rather than that, it looks like the registration&#8217;s open, so I’ll go on ahead.”</p>
<p>“Eh, but it&#8217;s not time yet, right?”</p>
<p>“We’re going even if it&#8217;s not time yet. See, take a look.”</p>

<p>Quena looked in the surroundings. I followed Quena&#8217;s line of sight as I was told. What I saw were the same adventurers as us.</p>
<p>Everyone was looking at us instead of toward the reception desk.</p>

<p>“They are?”</p>
<p>“They&#8217;re waiting for us to go first.”</p>
<p>“Why?”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s easy. Because we have the highest rank out of all of them.”</p>
<p>“Ah”</p>

<p>I kind of understood it.</p>
<p>Adventurers have the freedom to accept requests. There are probably some adventurers who haven’t accepted the urgent requests that came in this time.</p>
<p>Those adventurers were looking at me and Quena.</p>

<p>“I guess they think that if the higher ranked people take the request, they can secure a higher achievement rate and a minimum level of safety. That’s why, they’re waiting for us to take it.”</p>
<p>“That’s clever”</p>

<p>I honestly thought so.</p>
<p>If I were in their shoes and I had come to such an idea, I would have put it into practice.</p>
<p>Then Quena opened her eyes a little and said.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you angry?”</p>
<p>“No, no, why would I be?”</p>
<p>“Since they’re like hanger-ons*, you know? I think it&#8217;s normal to get irritated on them, though” <em>(TN: A person who just tags along)</em></p>
<p>“Hmm, is that so? Isn&#8217;t there some sort of adjustment on the guild side? Like the higher the rank, the more money you get from completing requests”</p>
<p>“Yes, well, you&#8217;re correct.”</p>

<p>After finishing the skewered meat, I toss the wooden skewers into the trash cans set up in the square without making a single inch of difference in my movement.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that okay. It just means that no one wants to die.”</p>

<p>It was the same with the chivalric order.</p>
<p>I always go first.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s how we&#8217;ve been able to complete dangerous missions together. Still, they survived the harsh days, as they escape or even meet death from it, and live through it.</p>
<p>Still, it doesn’t change the fact that we’re in a dangerous situation.</p>
<p>So it&#8217;s natural to want to survive and reduce the chances of sustaining injury even a little.</p>
<p>Besides, it would be foolish to scold them over minor things and not take the request.</p>
<p>Above all, it’s even more so if the guild is willing to adjust the rewards fairly.</p>

<p>“You’re, really weird”</p>

<p>Quena followed me while saying so.</p>
<p>And the adventurers who had been watching us followed, while stroking their chest with relief.</p>
<p>On the way to the reception desk, I asked Quena about something that had been bothering me.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, aside from Quena, how did the other adventurers even know about me?”</p>
<p>“Eh? You&#8217;re pretty famous, you know? You were an outsider who jumped in and became an S rank and devoured most of the requests in the vicinity of the royal capital in just three days. I&#8217;m sure your face is pretty well known through magic items.”</p>
<p>“Eh, is that so……”</p>

<p>I feel a little chilly about the facts that I learned for the first time.</p>
<p>I see. Come to think of it, when I meet adventurers sometimes, they avoid me. <em>I wonder if that’s because my face is known.</em></p>
<p><em>They don&#8217;t want to get involved with a man who dried up the requests. &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>
<p>I went to the reception desk while thinking so. The receptionist was a fresh young man. He probably just joined the knights.</p>
<p>In the chivalric order of the kingdom, all young men of this age look like they are about to die, but the young men of this country look very healthy.</p>

<p>“This is the reception desk. May I borrow your card?”</p>
<p>“Yes, here you go.”</p>
<p>“Certainly, I confirm it…… eh. You’re S-rank……? The party name is…… yo,you’re solo?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Solo? Party?”</p>

<p>I received words I don&#8217;t understand.</p>
<p><em>Am I a solo? But Quena&#8217;s with me, so I guess it&#8217;s a party?</em></p>
<p>As I was thinking this, Quena, who had been waiting behind me, popped up and supplemented me.</p>

<p>“There are solo ranks and ranks given to parties where several people gather. Zeid is a solo, but since you’re an S rank, you can take any request. This request was also addressed to a solo, so that makes you a solo.”</p>
<p>“Oh really. Then I’m a solo.”</p>
<p>“Ye,yes. I acknowledge. The procedure is now complete, thank you for your cooperation &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“A,ah. Please treat me well”</p>

<p>He asked me to shake his hand. When I grabbed it back, he grabbed it with both hands and bowed deeply.</p>
<p><em>This is how much expectation he has for S rank, huh. </em>Which is precisely why I feel like the responsibility is on my shoulders.</p>
<p>Well, it&#8217;s not like I&#8217;m going to crumble under the pressure or heavy responsibility, though.</p>
<p>Then, most of the adventurers completed the registration process. And this mission &#8230;&#8230;——no, the request started.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>A total of about a hundred adventurers had gathered.</p>
<p>The adventurers, including myself and Quena, were deployed to the north side of the forest where the monsters were in large numbers.</p>
<p>The operation is about to begin. Despite this, the adventurers’ faces showed little signs of tension.</p>

<p>“I guess they&#8217;re used to it.”</p>

<p>I suddenly muttered.</p>
<p>However, Quena immediately replied to my words.</p>

<p>“That&#8217;s not the case, you know. There aren&#8217;t many monsters in the northern part of the forest. They were just relieved with that”</p>
<p>“There’s not much out there? Then why are we going on that part?”</p>
<p>“Because there are only a few of us, the adventurers.”</p>
<p>“There&#8217;s nearly a hundred of us, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But if that were the case, there should’ve been more people that gathered. At least more than double of us.”</p>
<p>“Seriously? But why &#8230;&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t get an exact answer to my question, but Quena just looked at me silently as if she was reprimanding me.</p>
<p><em>Ah, </em>so I said with my mouth.</p>

<p>“Perhaps…… it&#8217;s my fault?”</p>
<p>“Correct”</p>

<p>Without pausing, Quena replied.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard that the number of adventurers in the vicinity has decreased due to the overwhelming number of requests from the Royal Capital being fulfilled, but that also has an effect on us here huh.</p>

<p>“The adventurers have gone to places where there are still requests, to the countries here and there and races that are in balance without conflict. So even if they scraped together the Holy Republic and the neighboring kingdoms, they only had this much strength.”</p>
<p>“……I’m, deeply sorry”</p>
<p>“No, that was my fault because I didn&#8217;t know what you were capable of and I challenged you to a match.”</p>

<p>I was filled with a feeling of great apology. Quena also seemed to feel some kind of guilt.</p>

<p>“Besides, that idiot didn&#8217;t even stop you as if having fun, so it&#8217;s not just your fault.”</p>

<p>A vein floated in Quena&#8217;s temple.</p>
<p>Perhaps she was referring to Riff. <em>I&#8217;ve somehow felt it, but the girl Guild Master seems to be quite the pleasure-seeker.</em></p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>Even so, it was me who did it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s not that I&#8217;m acting without thinking.</p>
<p>However, I still felt that I lacked knowledge and experience in many aspects. It was probably because I had been in an overly closed environment.</p>

<p>“I will continue to deepen my knowledge to carry out requests”</p>
<p>“……To the end, your purpose was to only fulfill requests. Normally, you would work for yourself. I&#8217;m already beyond amazed, I honestly respect you, you know”</p>

<p>Quena smiled bitterly.</p>
<p>Speaking of which, I asked Quena about something.</p>

<p>“What will they do in the other areas? Are the Knights of the Holy Republic in charge of everything?”</p>
<p>“No, they’re not. I heard that the Third Chivalric Order of the Kingdom of Kuzera happened to be staying nearby.”</p>

<p>Kingdom of Kuzera, Chivalric Order.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the organization I used to work for. There are three chivalric orders, from the first to the third, the first protecting the vicinity of the royal capital, the second protecting the interior of the kingdom, and the third protecting the adjacent borders.</p>
<p>I belonged to every order. This was because, I had been running around from the First to the Third Order whenever there was a mission.</p>
<p>The Third chivalric order, which happened to be nearby, would also be the organization to which I originally belonged. In addition, the last time I came to the aid of the Holy Republic, it was also on a mission as a Third Order.</p>

<p>“Is that so. It’s because the Holy Republic and the Kingdom of Kuzera are allies. It’s a form of protection by the three powers, huh; the guild, the kingdom, and the republic”</p>
<p>“Yes. That’s correct”</p>
<p>“Hah……”</p>

<p>I felt like I saw part of the reason why the soldiers of the Holy Republic were doing well.</p>
<p>If it had been the kingdom’s chivalric order, they would never have done something as costly as hiring adventurers. They even wouldn’t call in any allies. Since they didn&#8217;t want to owe anyone anything, and they didn&#8217;t want to show any weakness.</p>
<p><em>Hmm.</em></p>
<p>It turned out that the kingdoms’ chivalric order was in an extraordinarily dangerous situation.</p>
<p>What comes to my mind are the faces of my former colleagues who are exhausted.</p>
<p>As a matter of fact, I was working many times harder than my colleagues. <em>I wonder if there were enough hard-working people in the Order to fill that void.</em></p>
<p><em>……Perhaps there were.</em></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder if they&#8217;re in a very bad situation with me gone.</p>
<p>And then there&#8217;s Sheila. The girl who was suddenly promoted to Vice Commander of the First Order. She seemed to be an elite of the knight academy, but she wasn’t very accustomed to the field and did not seem to understand the details of the knight order. However, she possessed a straightforward sense of justice.</p>
<p><em>I hope that the Order, impatient with the collapse of the system, doesn&#8217;t make any strange choices&#8230;&#8230;.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“You’re, perhaps worried about the Kingdom’s chivalric order, aren’t you”</p>
<p>“Eh. Why all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>“Your face tells me it’s a bullseye. ……Haa, because you&#8217;re so serious, I got worried. Look here, the Order is your former workplace, so you need to divide it firmly. It&#8217;s the same with a request; once it&#8217;s done, it&#8217;s done.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I know, but &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“Besides, the request is about to begin now. And it&#8217;s also urgent. It&#8217;s no exaggeration to say that the guild&#8217;s reputation is at stake. You need to focus on this, you know?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, rest assured. I know that.”</p>

<p>The subjugation of monsters hasn’t started yet. However, I had already spotted the monsters in the area.</p>
<p>Emitting magic power like a thin wave, I could sense the difference between living and non-living things through the response of the magic power. By doing this all the time, I can see the quality, number, and location of the monsters as if I was looking at a map.</p>

<p>“……Oh, yes. As for requests, it feels like I don’t have any right to say anything about it”</p>

<p>Quena raised her hands to her head and shook her head from side to side, as if she had lost her mind.</p>
<p><em>No, </em>then I say.</p>

<p>“Thank you. You saved me.”</p>
<p>“——tu! As I said, you don&#8217;t have to say such a thing!”</p>

<p>Quena&#8217;s face turned red again.</p>
<p>She sharply poked me near my upper arm.</p>
<p>While we were chatting like this, the sound of a whistle finally echoed throughout the forest, and the monsters’ subjugation had begun.</p>

︎︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Start of the Request</strong></p>


<p>“Flame Sword!”</p>

<p>Quena slashes horizontally with her burning flames. The blazing flames and the sharp, bright red blade cut through multiple monsters that were standing in a vertical line.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t seen her ability clearly.</p>
<p>However, I felt that I understood the reason why Riff feared her even as a joke.</p>
<p>Quena is strong.</p>

<p>『Teyah! 』</p>
<p>『Tah! 』</p>

<p>In addition, several adventurers were also fighting in the vicinity.</p>
<p>They were called hanger-ons by Quena, but they were not weak at all. Rather, they were pushing up the front lines.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>To put it bluntly, I have no turn.</p>
<p>At first, I was very motivated to fight, but the adventurers went ahead of me.</p>

<p>“You&#8217;re not gonna fight? You”</p>

<p>Quena asked me as he stabbed a B-ranked monster that was lying on the ground.</p>

<p>“No, I just thought it would be a bad idea for me to interrupt your momentum.”</p>
<p>“Fuhn. So you&#8217;re handing over the merits. It&#8217;s like your way of atonement for what you&#8217;ve done, heh”</p>
<p>“Atonement &#8230;&#8230; is it. It&#8217;s nothing like that.”</p>

<p>The number of monsters you kill and the materials you obtained from their corpses are worth money.</p>
<p>Hence, it&#8217;s a separate reward from the request achievement money.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s probably why their momentum is so good.</p>
<p>Therefore, I shouldn’t go out. I have to leave some of their financial resources left in or near the royal capital.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s the kind of responsibility I should bear.</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>But I also know that I am overthinking this.</p>
<p>I also understand that the depletion of requests is a matter that should be resolved by the guild.</p>
<p>And that they&#8217;re not weak enough adventurers for me to care about.</p>
<p>Nevertheless.</p>
<p>I found that skipping out reduced my feelings of guilt.</p>

<p>“It&#8217;s my first time. Being like this”</p>

<p>I inadvertently said it.</p>
<p><em>There are too many differences from the Kingdom’s Chivalric order that I used to be in, and they are too far apart&#8230;&#8230; </em></p>
<p>It was as if I was living a different life.</p>
<p>Then the cleaning of monsters came to an end.</p>
<p>It was said that their numbers were small, but it was a close call. No one was seriously injured. Even if they were injured, they were only lightly injured.</p>
<p>In the midst of all this, I suddenly found a piece of crystal.</p>
<p>It has a light blue color…… with a hint of magic power left.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>This is a magic item. It can be used for a variety of purposes, depending on the type of magic circuit one puts into it.</p>
<p>They range from those that produce water and fire for household use, to those that can be used for transfer.</p>
<p><em>And this is &#8230;&#8230;.</em></p>

<p>“Oh my, there was a guy using magic items for cleaning up here”</p>

<p>As I held the shard, Quena appeared behind me and said so.</p>
<p><em>You startled the hell out of some people. </em>And it felt like she was getting closer. I could feel her plump breasts approaching my back.</p>

<p>“Ah, this magic item, I&#8217;ve only seen it once ——”</p>
<p>『This a message! The knight order of the Holy Republic, which has been fighting for subjugation in the west, is in a state of destruction! All adventurers, please support us as soon as possible! 』</p>

<p>A loud voice interrupts my words and gives us that news.</p>
<p>He must’ve come in quite a hurry. The member of the knight order who came to give the message was shaking his leg.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>『Destruction? An order powerful enough to maintain neutrality like that &#8230;&#8230;? 』</p>

<p>The adventurers were saying so as their faces turned pale. The destruction of the Knight order of the Holy Republic seemed to be a bizarre event.</p>
<p>Quena, who had been smiling in a relaxed manner earlier, also opened her eyes wide with a feeling as if she was shocked.</p>

<p>“What are you being vacant for. It’s a request, let’s go”</p>

<p>No matter what the situation, I know what I have to do.</p>
<p>It’s the subjugation of monsters. That&#8217;s it.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>State of destruction.</p>
<p>Indeed, that was the appropriate word.</p>
<p>A great deal of fresh blood fills the ground, and trees that have been knocked down lie pitifully on the ground.</p>
<p>They must’ve used a number of large-scale magic. Since the earth has been gouged out.</p>

<p>“What does, this mean……”</p>

<p>Quena painfully said.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>Probably a member of the troupe. A young man in armor, though he still looked young, stood in front of us adventurers from the north side of the forest.</p>

<p>“As you can see. We managed to push through the front lines, but there were still many monsters. The monsters got drawn to the smell of blood&#8230;&#8230;”</p>

<p>The area where the tents had probably been set up as a simple camp seemed to have suffered a lot of damage.</p>
<p>They are probably carrying the wounded to a location further down the line.</p>
<p>All that is left on the battlefield are knights who are no longer breathing.</p>
<p>Let me send a wave of magic power and examine the monsters.<em> ——I see.</em></p>

<p>“It&#8217;s about twice the quality and number of the monsters we just had a fight with on the north side.”</p>
<p>“I,is that true!? I had heard that there are few monsters in the north and they are relatively weak, but&#8230;&#8230;. still, I can’t believe it was twice that &#8230;&#8230; It happened at a time like this, when the main forces of the Holy Republic’s knight order are unable to convene due to other matters&#8230;&#8230;. The chivalric order of the kingdom is also still having a hard time defeating the monsters&#8230;&#8230;”</p>

<p>The young man says with a bitter look on his face.</p>
<p>He was a young man who didn&#8217;t seem to have been given a rank yet, but the fact that he knew so much information meant that he was probably at the commander&#8217;s level.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why, from his point of view, it feels like a desperate situation.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>However, I’m here.</p>

<p>“If it’s this much, then I’ll deal with it”</p>
<p>“Eh? We,well. However, even if it&#8217;s not the main unit, one of the knight orders has been in a state of being destroyed, you know&#8230;&#8230;?”</p>
<p>“It should be fine since the person himself who had grasped the enemy is saying that he will deal with it, you know. You should be treating the wounded as well.”</p>
<p>“Ye,yes…… but there are quite a few of them, so&#8230;&#8230; ah. I,I know this is a very rude question, but may I ask to get some help from the other adventurers?”</p>

<p>I heard a timid sound.</p>
<p><em>That&#8217;s how many people were injured, huh.</em></p>

<p>“Well, if that&#8217;s what the other adventurers want, why not?”</p>
<p>“Tha! That’s right, isn’t it, even though there are many monsters, there’s no way that’s…… eh?”</p>

<p>The young man gave a look as if saying 『Is this guy sane?』 in return to me.</p>
<p><em>If you look at me like that, it&#8217;s like I&#8217;m saying something strange. Please stop that.</em></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>“You heard him, guys~. If you don&#8217;t want to get hurt badly, please help this knight.”</p>

<p>Each of the adventurers nodded at Quena&#8217;s instructions.</p>
<p>Well, they don’t need to worry about making money from here anymore.</p>
<p>I guess they understood that.</p>
<p>Under the guidance of the young man, the adventurers left the place.</p>

<p>“You&#8217;re not going, Quena?”</p>
<p>“What is it? Will I be in danger if I stay?”</p>
<p>“If I were to apply the guild&#8217;s standards on them, I&#8217;d say there are six A ranks, thirteen B ranks, and forty-two C ranks.”</p>
<p>“What’s with that. Didn&#8217;t you say that it&#8217;s about twice the quality and quantity of the north side? That&#8217;s about ten times more already.”</p>
<p>“It was until a moment ago. Just at this moment, it increased dramatically.”</p>
<p>“&#8230;&#8230; What&#8217;s going on?”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Quena asked, finally realizing the seriousness of the situation.</p>
<p>I show her the piece of crystal that I picked up earlier.</p>

<p>“It’s this”</p>
<p>“That’s the magic item you were talking about. So, what&#8217;s wrong with that?”</p>
<p>“This is not for an attack. It&#8217;s for guidance.”</p>
<p>“Guidance &#8230;&#8230;? Could it be for the monsters!?”</p>

<p>Quena raised her voice as if she was too surprised.</p>

<p>“What&#8217;s with the surprise?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I’ll be! It&#8217;s a magic item that, like the Slave Collar, is banned from use even among conflicting races, you know!”</p>
<p>“Eh. Was that so?”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, how could you not know about it!”</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Perhaps from Quena&#8217;s point of view, those words were a rebuke to my lack of common sense.</p>
<p>But I answered quite seriously.</p>

<p>“Because it was commonly used in the Kuzera Kingdom.”</p>
<p>“In the kingdom……?”</p>
<p>“Ah. It was used for the purpose of subduing the monsters all at once because it’ll be troublesome if their appearance frequency becomes high. &#8230;&#8230; This magic item is the same as that.”</p>
<p>“Really!? Then this magic item is &#8230;&#8230;.”</p>
<p>“It was about 『The Kingdom’s chivalric order, who happened to be nearby, came to support us』, but even if they’re close, they’re probably near the border. They’re far from here. It&#8217;s hard to imagine that a knight order would be able to reach this forest as fast as us light-weight adventurers, you know.”</p>

<p>Adventurers are in different areas. Though some of them have been staying in the Holy Republic since the start. In addition, carriages have been arranged for us.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the Chivalric Order is moving in unison. <em>It’s more like walking.</em></p>
<p>Their march was supposed to take a long time, but their movement was as if it was forecasted by them.</p>

<p>“That&#8217;s too suspicious.”</p>
<p>“……That&#8217;s not all. They&#8217;re the kind of people who balk at rescue requests from various countries and arrive late, the chivalric order of the Kingdom of Kuzera. And yet, in the midst of such an extraordinary situation, they happened to be in the vicinity and rushed over to help. It was an unbelievable move of them, coming from the perspective of a former member of the group.&#8221;</p>

<p>“Bu,but isn&#8217;t it too much? What’s their purpose in the first place?”</p>
<p>“Purpose…… huh”</p>
<p>『Gouuuuuh!!』</p>

<p>A monster, caught by the smell of blood, attacked Quena and me while we were in the middle of our conversation.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a bear-like monster with horns and is four meters tall. Its horns are electrified. It has both magic and muscle power. <em>I guess this would be a B rank.</em></p>

<p>“Ti,Tial Bear &#8230;&#8230;! A B-rank already appeared!?”</p>

<p>To have interrupted our talk, it’s bothersome.</p>

<p>“You&#8217;re in the way.”</p>

<p>With a finger flick to its forehead, I obliterated the upper half of the Tial bear&#8217;s body. <em>Now it won&#8217;t be able to move anymore.</em></p>
<p>I continue to tell Quena, who was staring at it blankly.</p>

<p>“Well, let’s just ask what the purpose of the Chivalric Order of the Kingdom is —— To those who were sneaking around in the back of this horde of monsters.”</p>

<p>My wave of magic power had already caught a few people. And what they&#8217;re holding was probably the complete set of pieces that I am holding —— the magic item.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>In the camp laid out by the Knights of the Holy Republic down the line.</p>
<p>After wiping out the monsters, I came face to face with the young commander I had met earlier.</p>
<p>A few more knights are also in the same tent.</p>

<p>“Th,the Third Order of the Kingdom of Kuzera caused this mass outbreak of monsters, is it!?”</p>

<p>The young man asked me, as I looked at the members of the Kingdom’s knight order that was sticking out.</p>

<p>“Yes. This magic item is the evidence.”</p>
<p>“That is……?”</p>
<p>“This is what attracts the monsters. It seems that it’s forbidden, but it looks like it is actually being used like this.”</p>
<p>“No way, the kingdom used this &#8230;&#8230; But why!?”</p>

<p>The young man asked with a look of disbelief on his face.</p>
<p>From the looks of it, he’s not going to believe me even when I tell him the rest of the story. But, well, the situation needs to be explained.</p>
<p>I take a glimpse at the tattered members of the Kingdom Knights.</p>

<p>“It’s invasion, right”</p>

<p>The members of their troops turned away with a <em>difficult to stay in this place</em> look.</p>

<p>“Invasion!? I,is the kingdom in opposition to the Holy Republic!? Bu,but, isn&#8217;t the Third Kingdom knight order coming to help us in the event of a crisis like this&#8230;&#8230;”</p>

<p>As you can imagine, he didn&#8217;t seem to believe much of what I said.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose that&#8217;s true, too. It&#8217;s hard for him to believe me when I say something strange. But that shouldn&#8217;t mean that they have no trust in the guild.</p>
<p>He simply couldn&#8217;t believe a man who was suddenly promoted, even though he was S rank.</p>
<p>In the first place, it is natural to trust the country when it comes to an individual and a country.</p>
<p>However, Quena, who was standing beside me, also interceded.</p>

<p>“It was certainly what the knight there was saying, you know. Zeid interrogated them and they said, 『The Kingdom intends to invade the Holy Republic』.”</p>
<p>“…&#8230;That is. Somewhat unbelievable……”</p>

<p>He’s being very inarticulate.</p>
<p>Well, he may be a commander class, but this is beyond the level of judgment that a single soldier can make.</p>
<p>However, even if this is the case, we can&#8217;t just leave it at that.</p>
<p>The content of the request is to subdue a large number of monsters. In other words, it&#8217;s a cleaning-up battle.</p>
<p>Since the monsters are being controlled by the Third Chivalric Order behind the scenes, it is possible that the extermination of them will be part of the request.</p>
<p>And we&#8217;ve actually captured a member of the Order.</p>
<p>This battle will not end until the source is eliminated. If we don&#8217;t do that, the situation will gradually become worse and worse. The moment I was about to tell him to call a higher-up.</p>
<p>The tent of the base was torn off.</p>

<p>“Where are the injured!?”</p>

<p>A beautiful girl with vivacious-looking peach-colored hair entered the room.</p>
<p>Those who saw her smiled brightly all at once, and everyone said her name uniformly.</p>

<p>“““Soria-sama!!”””</p>
<p>“Soria Aiden &#8230;&#8230; the 【Saint of the Light Star】”</p>

<p>Quena, who was standing next to me, seemed to have been caught off guard. She was stunned.</p>
<p>I was a little surprised as well.</p>
<p>It seems that this girl was the one who strongly recommended me to the guild. She is S rank and is even called a saint——.</p>
<p>She was probably still in her mid to late teens.</p>
<p>She has large eyes and lightly pigmented white skin, with thin lines but a strong core. <em>I guess she has a feminine body.</em></p>
<p>I wonder what it is. <em>She has an aura called The Saint floating from her.</em></p>
<p>I wondered if it was because I was looking at her too closely while thinking about it. My eyes met with Soria&#8217;s.</p>

<p>“…………”</p>
<p>“…………”</p>

<p>For a moment, the air froze. There was so much silence that was flowing.</p>
<p><em>Eh.</em></p>
<p><em>Did I do something?</em></p>
<p><em>I can&#8217;t find the answer.</em></p>
<p>For the meantime,</p>

<p>“Hello”</p>

<p>I bowed lightly.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s a face I’m not familiar with, but she has recommended me to become an S rank. Perhaps she knows about me.</p>
<p>And that expectation was probably correct.</p>
<p>Her face flushed so beautifully red that it made a <em>ka~h</em> sound effect.</p>

<p>“Ze,Ze,Zeid……san!! I,I,I’m sorry, but I need to focus on healing right now! That&#8217;s right, Zeid-san’s sto,sto,sto,story &#8230;&#8230;! I have to heal now!!”</p>

<p>She seems to be quite confused.</p>
<p>However, I somehow had an idea of what she wanted to say.</p>

<p>“Don&#8217;t worry about me, please heal them first.”</p>

<p>I hear she specializes in healing. If so, I think she can&#8217;t leave it alone since there were injured here.</p>

<p>“Thank you very much!!”</p>

<p>I didn&#8217;t even do anything, but she thanked me with a heartfelt look of happiness.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/25CY044/178712.jpg" alt="178712" border="0"></a>

<p>The young man who I had been talking to earlier instructed the knights in the tent in a reverent manner.</p>

<p>“Please escort Soria-sama to the tent where the injured individuals are! Thank you for coming all this way, Soria-sama. Please take care of our comrades!”</p>
<p>“Yes, I&#8217;ll take care of them!”</p>

<p>She left with a big smile on her face. In order to heal the wounded.</p>

<p>“That’s Soria Aiden-sama, you know. They say she’s the best healer on the continent.”</p>
<p>“Ah, I could tell just from being in the same space for a bit. She was amazing.”</p>
<p>“I didn&#8217;t know you could see that. I only thought she had the aura, though.”</p>
<p>They didn&#8217;t seem to be surprised or confused by my conversation anymore. <em>Quena said as if she was used to it.</em></p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>Darkness of the Kingdom's Chivalry Order</strong></p>


<p>In the tent packed with me, Quena, Soria who has finished healing, and the knights of the Holy Republic, Baran Zudy, the leader of the Third chivalric order and also known as 【Crimson Lotus】, enters.</p>
<p>There is not a scratch or stain on his luxurious armor. He has a beard and greasy skin, and a sarcastic look on his face.</p>
<p>Baran noticed me first.</p>


<p>“Ahn? Oh, oh, oh, well, well, well. Aren’t you the kingdom soldier who betrayed the kingdom for money? Zeid-kun”</p>

<p>Baran approaches me with an indescribably stupid look on his face.</p>
<p><em>I wonder if he is trying to irritate me in his own way. To tell the truth, I don&#8217;t feel a twinge of irritation at all.</em></p>
<p>I just said &#8220;Hi&#8221; to him with a light bow.</p>


<p>“Ah. I understand. It’s awkward, isn&#8217;t it? Haha, well, that’s right. It must be hard to face your former boss. Moreover, it’s after you betrayed us…… how much more so?”</p>


<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>I have never felt sorry for these guys in particular. That’s a selfish misunderstanding. In the first place, it was not a betrayal, I should have followed the proper procedure to withdraw from the group, though.</p>
<p>Well, but if I talk back untactfully, it will deviate from the main subject. <em>More than that.</em></p>


<p>“Leave me alone, we have better things to talk about right now.”</p>
<p>“Leave you alone? Hahaha, you&#8217;re being desperate to escape, you traitor! I wonder if it’s because you have such a hopeless personality that you are lured by money?”</p>


<p><em>Hmm.</em></p>
<p>I don&#8217;t mean to run away from this, but I guess I&#8217;m getting a lot of hate. <em>The meaning of his words is taken in a distorted way.</em></p>
<p>As I was pondering what to do, Quena, who was standing next to me, let out a sigh.</p>


<p>“Hey, you know what? It&#8217;s like saying that the kingdom and the Knights are a bunch of incompetent people, that have pulled out people whom they can&#8217;t pay for, in which they can be greeted as S ranks in the guild.”</p>
<p>“Wha,wha,wha……! You are mocking the Kingdom of Kuzera and its proud Knight Order! In addition, I am the Commander of the Third Order! I&#8217;m Baran Zudy, the 【Crimson Lotus】!”</p>
<p>“I only know you by name, only by name.”</p>
<p>“What! Then I suppose you have heard the anecdote of how I, all by myself, held off an army of the Empire! You&#8217;ve got to be kidding me!”</p>


<p>Perhaps overflowing with emotion, Baran drew his white silver sword.</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>Quena was completely uninterested and wouldn’t make any eye contact with him.</p>
<p>It got into a strange stalemate.</p>


<p>“Ahem, Baran-san, isn’t that enough?”</p>


<p>Soria said so after coughing once.</p>
<p>Baran also flinched when he saw Soria. It seems that Soria&#8217;s influence is that strong.</p>
<p>Well, now the atmosphere is finally less weird.</p>
<p>The rest of the talk, however, will be even more chaotic.</p>
<p>The youth commander looked Baran in the eye.</p>


<p>“Actually, it seems that a member of the Third Chivalric Order, who was being in custody in another tent, was using a prohibited magic item. May I ask you for your input?”</p>
<p>“Wha,what?”</p>


<p>Baran looked clearly upset.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>



<p>“In fact, the magic item here seems to have something to do with this uproar. It is something that guides the monsters.”</p>
<p>“I see. A deranged member of the troupe did something, huh. Then I can just dispose of the man.”</p>


<p>Without even listening to the words of the young commander, Baran simply dismissed him. I could see that Soria was more than a little surprised and angry at this.</p>


<p>“He,he&#8217;s your subordinate, you know!? You&#8217;re going to end it with a confusing brief comment of &#8220;deranged&#8221;!?”</p>
<p>“What else can I do about it? What can you do about what has been done?”</p>
<p>“That’s…… the Knight order of the Kingdom must also be responsible for it!”</p>
<p>“I can&#8217;t control each and every one of them, you know.”</p>


<p>Baran scratches his ear with a small, silly smile. It&#8217;s as if he didn&#8217;t hear what they were saying. It seems that he has no regard for the knight whom he has abandoned.</p>
<p>The young commander continued with a hint of disgust.</p>


<p>“It seems, that he installed the magic item on your order.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>“……What was that?”</p>


<p>Baran glares at the young commander.</p>


<p>“On this me! Are you laying the blame in front of my eyes in order to yield!? That troupe member is an incorrigible piece of garbage &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>


<p>Baran reveals his anger, spitting all over the place.</p>
<p><em>Oy, oy, oy.</em></p>
<p>From the point of view of the captured members of the troupe, this would be a boomerang, though.</p>


<p>“Is this person always like this?”</p>


<p>Quena, who was next to me, put her mouth to my ear and asked so.</p>
<p>I nod lightly.</p>


<p>“He&#8217;s very self-centered, you know. It&#8217;s something the Knight Order have in common, though.”</p>
<p>“I understood that from what I saw. It can’t be helped, this is the kind of person their leader is.”</p>


<p>Quena shrugs helplessly.</p>
<p>As we were having this conversation, Baran continued.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>



<p>“Then bring him to me.”</p>


<p>Those were —— the words I expected.</p>
<p>It was something about the captive member of the troupe.</p>


<p>“……Why?”</p>


<p>The young commander asks Baran.</p>
<p>Baran says with a snort.</p>


<p>“Since I really have to ask if that troupe member claims that it was commanded by me. It is possible that you are trying to frame us, the Third Order, for a crime we didn’t inflict.”</p>


<p>Baran said seeming very sarcastic.</p>
<p>Apparently, he is incapable of caring about others. He doesn&#8217;t even seem to choose his words.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>



<p>It seems to be quite unpleasant, but somehow, the young commander shook his head vertically.</p>


<p>“……Is that so, I understand.”</p>


<p>The young commander ordered one of his knights to bring him in.</p>
<p>And then ———— the prisoner of war came into the tent.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>In front of Zeid and the others, Baran verbally abused the captured knight.</p>


<p>『You are a useless piece of trash! 』</p>
<p>『It’s outrageous for you to accuse this reputable me! 』</p>
<p>『What do you think being a knight is! What you are doing is no better than thieves or even livestock! 』</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>『You know what will happen to your family in the country at this rate, right!? 』</p>


<p>It was like that.</p>
<p>It had already become something of a half threat.</p>
<p>Zeid knew that this was the current state of the knight order, so he said nothing. However, the members of the Holy Republic and Quena were quite stunned.</p>
<p>It is unusual to blame a subordinate in public, tearing him to shreds like this.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding the fact that he is a prisoner of war, notwithstanding the fact that he is a human being who works under him.</p>
<p>He shouts abuses without even a word of concern.</p>
<p>The captive knight even shed tears.</p>
<p>Baran continues to ask such a knight.</p>


<p>“You, mentioned that I ordered you to set up the magic item.….. Is that true?”</p>


<p>Baran glares at him.</p>
<p>The captive knight&#8217;s body stiffened, but he managed to keep his lips from quivering as he tried to speak.</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>



<p>“Tha,that’s. Correct ……”</p>


<p>However,</p>
<p>Baran loudly interrupted the captive knight&#8217;s words.</p>


<p>“Like I said before! If you ever try to falsely accuse me, I will not acknowledge it. It&#8217;s not just you I’ll condemn&#8230;&#8230; your family too.”</p>
<p>“——Tsu!”</p>


<p>The captive group members look shocked beyond words. Despair, fear, anxiety &#8230; they have dark faces mixed with such negative emotions.</p>
<p>They looked down with shadows on their faces as if to say, that they have given up everything in this world.</p>
<p>Baran, perhaps satisfied with his dominance at the sight of them, plays with his beard elatedly.</p>


<p>“Yup, yup, then that’s fine. You just became deranged and installed a forbidden magic item. You aren&#8217;t commanded by anyone, right?”</p>
<p>“……It’s di…… fferrent”</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“Ahn? What was that? I can&#8217;t hear you~”</p>


<p>They won’t be able to go against him anymore.</p>
<p>Baran had that composure. So they just dared to listen to him being provocative and amused.</p>
<p>Contrary to expectations, however, the prisoner of war looked up and said something with determination.</p>


<p>“I&#8217;m saying it&#8217;s different! I was ordered by you to give them the magic item ——…&#8230;!?”</p>


<p>However.</p>
<p>Before he could say all that, his head —— had separated from his torso.</p>


<p>“……Eh?”</p>


<p>Those, were the last words uttered by the head that tumbled to the ground.</p>
<p>What his head saw was Baran wielding a sword dyed with blood.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>“Fuhn! I wish he had not said anything unnecessary. It&#8217;s pitiful that he was deranged until the end. Now, if you&#8217;ll excuse me. If you still have something to say, please come to the Kingdom.”</p>


<p>Baran leaves, while spitting out.</p>
<p>They never picked up the corpses of their slain compatriots, let alone put them into their view. They’re like stones they can see from here and there.</p>
<p>Baran leaves, and a few seconds later.</p>
<p>Inside the tent —— the true scene was flowing out.</p>


<p>“——And so, well, it&#8217;s pretty clear that the Third Chivalric Order, and by extension, the Kingdom, was involved in this”</p>


<p>I broke the illusion magic I had cast on the place.</p>
<p>The illusion that Baran had slashed also fizzled out like a shimmering flame. And the prisoner of war knight appeared from another place in perfectly good health——.</p>


<p>“I don’t know what to say……”</p>


<p>It was the leading figure of the Holy Republic who uttered those words, unable to hide her surprise.</p>
<p>She was called Soria. She seemed to be the top person who can respond in a hurry even in this emergency.</p>


<p>“Well, there&#8217;s no way a knight could have a magic item that could lead monsters to here in the first place.”</p>


<p>Quena nodded in agreement with my words.</p>
<p>The prisoner of war looked down in disgust and did not deny it.</p>


<p>“This sequence of scenes is preserved in the magic item of video recording. For the time being, an emergency meeting will be held at the upper management to decide how to respond. Zeid-san, thank you very much for this opportunity.”</p>


<p>The man who is supposed to be a fairly superior person bowed his head to me. In addition, Soria, the young commander, and the others bowed their heads in unison to me as well.</p>


<p>“No,no, it&#8217;s just part of the request.”</p>

<p>It’s embarrassing as expected, so I want you guys to raise your heads.</p>
<p>I thought so, but then someone who seemed to have more authority said.</p>


<p>“No, I will double your commission since you have done so much for us! Thank you so much for saving our country from a crisis&#8230;!”</p>



<p>She bowed even more deeply.</p>


<p>“Oh, no. Please raise your head. I&#8217;m happy just to hear you thank me like that, you know”</p>


<p>Those were my true words.</p>
<p>I receive requests and get paid. That&#8217;s what I do as an adventurer. However, along with the money comes a &#8220;thank you&#8221;. The receptionist also says, &#8220;Thank you for your hard work.&#8221; to me.</p>
<p>Those words of gratitude permeate my heart.</p>
<p>I was reminded yet again by Baran earlier. That work is a matter of course. After finishing the job, the only thing he would say is, &#8220;Move on to the next job as soon as possible”. <em>It was really a helpless organization.</em></p>
<p>When I was thinking about that, <em>furufuru,</em> Soria began to tremble.</p>
<p><em>Eh, did I do something?</em></p>
<p>When I think back on how I have no fault,</p>


<p>“How far &#8230;&#8230; have you gone, what a wonderful man, you are!!”</p>


<p>Soria, who had been scurrying around without even making eye contact with me, grabbed my hand and pressed closer. She had a lot of momentum.</p>
<p>However, she immediately realized that she had overreacted, so she let go of my hand.</p>


<p>“I’m, I’m so, I’m sorry! For what just happened……! Uhmm, that was…… tha,that’s right! That was amazing! That illusion magic! I&#8217;ve never seen anything as advanced as that!”</p>


<p>She must have been very embarrassed.</p>
<p>Her face is stained in vermilion and she wanders from side to side, refusing to make eye contact.</p>


<p>“I agree. I have certainly only seen that level of magic in that stupid guild master-san.”</p>


<p>Quena sent a rescue boat to Soria. <em>This girl is really smart.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“Ah, that huh. There was a forest I entered when I was little, and in there, I saw a monster that showed me illusions. So I just copied its magic power movements.”</p>


<p>It was nostalgic.</p>
<p>No matter how much I ran, I couldn&#8217;t get out of the same place. I think I identified at the end the monster that was displaying strange magic power movements and learned not to fall for the same kind of trick again.</p>


<p>“““Eh?”””</p>


<p>Everyone&#8217;s eyes darted in unison and they even tilted their heads.</p>


<p>“When you were little…… forest…… is it. In addition, the monsters can do magic……?”</p>
<p>“……What kind of environment did you grow up in?”</p>


<p>Arere. It feels like they were drawing back. I wonder if it was that unusual.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>Kingdom of Kuzera – the Headquarters of the Chivalric order.</p>
<p>There, they gathered the Commander and Deputy Commander of the First Order, the Commander and Deputy Commander of the Second Order, the Commander and Deputy Commander of the Third Order, as well as the elites of commanding class.</p>
<p>The commanders were sitting at a round table, while the deputy commanders and other commander-level officers each stand behind their immediate superiors.</p>


<p>“After all, the king has investigated the responsibility topic, Baran Zudi, the leader of the Third Order”</p>



<p>Glaring at him was the Commander of the First Order of Knights, Rande Isla, who was in the most powerful position in the place.</p>
<p>Rande was looking at Baran, who was staring at the magic item of recording, with a mixture of anger and surprise. A blue magic item about the size of a fist and shaped like a square showed Baran cutting an illusion and a statement that clearly could not be described as 『irrelevant』.</p>


<p>“Why! I&#8217;m sure what I saw was that stupid knight captured there! Even the feeling of cutting him is unmistakable! This is the stupidest thing I&#8217;ve ever seen&#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“No good, Baran. Unsightly”</p>
<p>“But, Rande &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>



<p>Seeing the annoyed looking First Knight Commander Rande, Baran couldn&#8217;t help but shut his mouth.</p>


<p>“Now you have three choices. One is to pay all reparations claimed by the Holy Republic out of your own pocket.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s absurd! The budget provided to the Third Order cannot even cover the living and travel expenses of its members!”</p>


<p>Perhaps only Sheila, the deputy commander of the First Order, could understand the abnormality of the words that Baran spilled out unintentionally.</p>
<p>Even though it was said that it was by his own pocket, he is trying to take it to the Third chivalric order’s budget. With a look that it belongs to him. Moreover, he wanted to spend all the money on food and carriage fares for the members of his troupe.</p>
<p>He doesn’t have the slightest thought of spending the money he has saved.</p>
<p>That is something that is never going to happen.</p>
<p>However, in the current atmosphere full of trickery of the chivalric order, it was a statement that did not feel out of place.</p>
<p>Rande then gives Baran a second option.</p>


<p>“The second is—— to die”</p>
<p>“Wha!? Are you telling me to die!?”</p>
<p>“Indeed. If you can&#8217;t take responsibility, at least you give your head. That may loosen the conditions on the part of the Holy Republic.”</p>
<p>“Ridiculous! That&#8217;s impossible!”</p>


<p>Baran, who doesn&#8217;t think he&#8217;s at fault at all, shakes his head.</p>
<p>As if that was expected of him, Rande mentioned the next option.</p>


<p>“The third one. Force all the members of the Third Chivalric Order to wear the 『Slave Collar』.”</p>
<p>“……!?”</p>


<p>Slave collar.</p>
<p>Baran was astonished when he heard that word.</p>
<p>It was a magic item that was forbidden to be used even in a war between warring races, the same as that magic item that induces monsters.</p>
<p>It used to be traded behind the scenes, but it was so inhumane that it led to the formation of an alliance that went beyond interspecies friction and destroyed the organization that was distributing it.</p>
<p>Now, even the method of making them has ceased to exist, and it is not even certain that slave collars still exist. &#8230;&#8230; that should have been the case.</p>


<p>“Don’t tell me…… you have it?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I found it in the National Treasure Vault. And, I —— already had the First and the Second Knight order members to require to wear them.”</p>
<p>“What……!? While we are on an expedition to the land of the Holy Republic!?”</p>
<p>“It was simple. There will be no escapees with this. No one rebelled against the few orders that existed. Those who were frightened to death  —— were none.”</p>


<p>Blood dripped down from Sheila&#8217;s fist as she listened to his words.</p>
<p>Unable to hear or see, Sheila desperately tried to turn away from the current situation. She knew that being in this miserable meeting is a step toward reversing this situation one day.</p>
<p>She knows better than anyone that there is nothing she can do to help now.</p>
<p>She is searching for what to do and what she can do. She bit her lip, telling herself to be patient for now.</p>
<p>However, on the contrary, the mouth of Baran Zudi, the leader of the Third Knights, became slacken.</p>



<p>“If there was such a thing, you should have told me right away.”</p>
<p>『!?』</p>


<p>Even Sheila&#8217;s petty hopes were shattered.</p>
<p>Even the faint hope that the Commander of the Third Order would stop him, had vanished.</p>
<p>The corners of Rande&#8217;s mouth turned up as well when he heard Baran&#8217;s words.</p>


<p>“Is that so, I&#8217;m sorry. If I had told you earlier, you could have ordered that captured man to kill himself before he could give up any more information.”</p>
<p>“Totally. But now I won&#8217;t have to make the same kind of screw-up again. Hahaha! You taught me well. However, if I put a slave collar on them, that will wipe out my sins, you say? How?”</p>
<p>“——Drop them, to the Holy Republic. Then you will have no problem with reparations &#8230;&#8230; will you?”</p>
<p>“Fuhahaha……! I see. In the first place, the Third Order&#8217;s induction of the monsters and their attack on the Knights of the Holy Republic, was a prelude to our takeover of the country. Our forces being a death-defying army&#8230;&#8230; there will be no doubt that this will increase our territory!”</p>



<p>Laughter abounds from the upper echelons of the knight order, with the exception of Sheila.</p>
<p>What would the royalty and civilian officials think if they saw this extraordinary sight?</p>
<p>They may have guessed it, but they don&#8217;t know that they are so corrupt.</p>
<p>And the upper echelons of the Chivalric Order could have understood how crazy they were if they could have looked at themselves objectively, but they were unable to do so and just kept going through the conspiracy without stopping in their deviant state.</p>

︎︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>4: A Request for Salvation</strong></p>


<p>I had another urgent request.</p>
<p>I have been receiving urgent requests at quite a high pace, but it is not uncommon, apparently. It was said by Quena, an A-ranked senior beautiful adventurer standing by my side.</p>


<p>“Aren’t you too fast ……?”</p>


<p>Quena said a little tiredly.</p>
<p>Quena was tired but not out of breath, even though we had run all the way to the forest from the royal capital.</p>


<p>“It&#8217;s an urgent request, so we had to hurry.”</p>
<p>“But I thought that the story was that the chivalric order was already ahead of us.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, is that right?”</p>


<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>I question back to the story I hadn&#8217;t heard.</p>


<p>“Yeah, it is. This is the forest near the Royal capital, right? That alone is a matter for the chivalric order, you know”</p>
<p>“Well, yes, that&#8217;s true.”</p>


<p>The area near the royal capital is protected by the First Order.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that they are a group of guards exclusively for the royal family. If a dangerous monster appears, they immediately go to subjugate it.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s something I can understand because I was also a member of the First Chivalric Order, so I wonder why did we receive a request as well.</p>


<p>“Geez…… the merchants are also selfish. The First Chivalric Order is going to subdue it, so why don&#8217;t they wait a little while to carry their stuff?”</p>
<p>“No, no, if it&#8217;s fresh fruits or something like that, speed is important. I&#8217;ve eaten some that fell out of trees and rotted, and it tasted bad.”</p>
<p>“……Why are you eating such stuff&#8221;</p>


<p>Quena said, &#8220;Ugeh,&#8221; with her face turning blue. She&#8217;s the one who knows that I lived in a harsh forest, so I don’t need to explain it anymore.</p>
<p><em>She is poking fun at herself.</em></p>

<div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>.”Well, but I guess thanks to that merchant-san, the request came this way, It&#8217;s just right because I&#8217;ve been free since we returned from the Holy Republic.”</p>
<p>“You, haven&#8217;t done much with the board requests since then, haven&#8217;t you? I mean, you haven&#8217;t even shown up at the guild. You don&#8217;t have to mind it too much, you know?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that I mind it too much. I was looking at the card and confirming the requests. I just don&#8217;t have anything that&#8217;s just right.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine, though. Ah, it&#8217;s about time we arrive.”</p>
<p>“Ah, we’ve got five minutes left to run at this pace.”</p>


<p>My wave of magic power had already captured a total of 250 knights who were fighting a group of 17 wyverns.</p>
<p>A magic power and form that I’m familiar with was also there.</p>


<p>“Five minutes, right. &#8230;&#8230; Zeid&#8217;s detection magic is as amazing as ever.”</p>


<p>She calls this wave of mine as detection magic.</p>
<p>It is a fairly advanced magic, and is useful for traps by way of magic circles that are normally difficult to find, or for sensing the approach of monsters in dimly lit areas.</p>
<p>Its range is said to be limited to about five meters for a top-class user, and I hear that usually, if you can extend it as far as two meters, you will be solicited by A-rank class parties.</p>
<p>I was only doing it as much as I needed to, but the last time I tried to get serious just to get a glimpse of it, I had to stop because it swallowed the whole royal capital and the monsters reacted excessively.</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>By the way, it also reacted to Riff. <em>That little girl is amazing.</em></p>
<p>As I continued to probe with such detection magic, I felt something strange.</p>


<p>“Nn……?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, something is strange. It’s their state”</p>
<p>“State? Is it about the Wyverns?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s the chivalric order”</p>
<p>“The Order? Are they all dead?&#8221;</p>


<p>Quena makes a number of guesses.</p>
<p>But none of them are correct.</p>


<p>“I felt two kind of strangeness. One is probably Sheila —— a deputy leader class is fighting on the front line.”</p>
<p>“That wasn’t …… normal, right. It&#8217;s a rather big deal. I wonder why. Did she feel that it was unavoidable because the members are stuck?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>“No, the group is moving. On top of that, Sheila is also fighting. Sheila had just become the deputy leader and was kind and humane to us who are her underlings. She&#8217;s probably fighting on the front lines on her own volition.”</p>
<p>“I see. But you felt a strangeness, right?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. She would not have been allowed to fight so under the orders from his father, who is currently the head of the First Order.”</p>


<p>Yes. She wasn&#8217;t allowed to. As long as we were in front of her, she would have been told to stand firmly behind us.</p>
<p>In fact, it is rare for her to even be on the battlefield like this.</p>


<p>“That&#8217;s why it was so strange, right. What&#8217;s the other one?”</p>
<p>“The other one…… was a collar? It seems to be a magic item like a thread circling the neck which appears to control the bodies of the troupe members. &#8230;..”</p>
<p>“Collar…… control……? Hey, does that commander named Sheila also have that?”</p>
<p>“No, it doesn’t seem to be attached to her”</p>
<p>“……That maybe it!”</p>


<p>Quena seemed to have picked up on something from my words.</p>
<p>But I don&#8217;t have time to hear the continuation of her words. Five minutes have already passed.</p>
<p>In other words, we have arrived at the place where the First Order was fighting.</p>



<p>“——Quena, drop the one flying from the direction of seven o&#8217;clock!”</p>
<p>“Okay!”</p>

<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>She instantly responded to my spur-of-the-moment instructions, and faithfully drew her flaming sword to face the wyvern, which was more than twice her size.</p>
<p>The Wyvern&#8217;s rank is B. It would not be a cakewalk for a high ranking Quena to take on one.</p>
<p>And I ——</p>


<p>『Guooooeeeeee!!! 』</p>


<p>Sheila is fighting further in front.</p>
<p>Her sword was repelled and there was no way for her to prevent the wyvern&#8217;s attack. The knights and soldiers around her don&#8217;t seem to be able to move.</p>
<p>—— already understood it by detection magic.</p>


<p>“First form——”</p>


<p>It’s one of the magic of the monsters I encountered in the 『Forbidden Forest Depths』. It has certainly no clear image, but it was indeed existed as magic.</p>
<p>Then the monster suddenly appeared, and with its sharp magic power, it easily sliced the trees as hard as steel into two.</p>
<p>Its gist is the same as that.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>It was the first magic I ever saw and learned.</p>
<p>The action of drawing the sword is done in the empty space.</p>
<p>Just by putting magic power into it, the empty space in my hand becomes a sword of wind that cuts through all things.</p>


<p>“——【Flash】”</p>


<p>The wyvern was easily bisected.</p>
<p>Its body that was closing in on Sheila falls to the ground and dies.</p>


<p>“Are you okay, Sheila”</p>


<p>I asked, while looking sideways at the beautiful blonde girl who was stunned with her buttocks poking.</p>
<p>She looked like she can&#8217;t say anything with her eyes wide open. I felt relieved to see that she has no injury.</p>
<p>Or rather, in another place, Quena has already killed two of them.</p>
<p>The members of the troupe, relieved by the reinforcements, began to stab their swords into the ground and lean their bodies forward, throw their bodies to the ground, and rest as they pleased.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>Since this unit is under the command of Sheila, it would be possible for them to rest when the mission is over. Any other commander would have ordered the knights to return without any regard to their conditions.</p>
<p>There are still wyverns in the area, but with the arrival of us, their reinforcements, I guess they thought that the mission is over. Besides, their faces looked tired and seemed to be in their limits.</p>
<p>Looking at her, Sheila&#8217;s well-organized face looks tired and listless.</p>


<p>“What happened, Sheila”</p>


<p>Once again, I asked her.</p>
<p>Then tears began to trickle from Sheila&#8217;s eyes.</p>
<p>At the end, although we&#8217;re in the middle of a herd of wyverns —— she hugged me.</p>
<p>She must have been super scared.</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all. That alone won&#8217;t drive her up to this point.</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/yBq8wkB/178713.jpg" alt="178713" border="0"></a>

<p>Sheila then says,</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“……I can&#8217;t &#8230;&#8230; do this &#8230;&#8230; help me &#8230;&#8230; Zeid &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>


<p>With that, she came to me.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>It had been a while since I heard Sheila&#8217;s call for salvation.</p>
<p>Me and Quena killed a bunch of wyverns. Or rather, we had killed most of them.</p>
<p>Most of the members of the troupe are down. Sheila is barely sitting in her two squares, but she seems to be at her limit as well. I can see that she is forcing her eyelids to pry open heavily.</p>
<p>In this context, Sheila explained it. <em>Right now, I wonder what is happening in the Royal Knight order. And I wonder what are those things around their necks.</em></p>
<p>Quena opens her mouth.</p>


<p>“Heh, as I thought, it was a slave collar, huh”</p>


<p>Quena looks at the necks of the troupe members which she expected.</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>There was a thread-like line around their necks that was hard to see but it reflected light if one strained their eyes.</p>


<p>“Is this something so hard to comprehend, this slave collar”</p>
<p>&#8220;No, it is supposed to be thicker and kind of tough.”</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s correct. Unlike the traditional ones that were designed to let people know that they were slaves, these were modified for the Knight order to prevent them from being found out. The commander said that it was simple because he had the diagrams to make it.”</p>


<p>Sheila, who was somewhat better rested, explained so.</p>
<p>Sheila&#8217;s explanation seemed to convince Quena. She opened one hand and slapped the other hand together in a <em>guh</em>.</p>
<p>“That&#8217;s a banned magic item. All he has to do is to keep the troupe members quiet, and the only creature that can sense anything out of place is Zeid.”</p>


<p><em>They left me alone as if being treated as an outsider.</em></p>
<p>However, this is another story that is getting a little too fishy.</p>
<p>I can only say that the Kingdom’s chivalric order have lost their minds, since they as well cause an uproar in the Holy Republic.</p>


<p>“What should I do……”</p>



<p>Sheila made a weak sound. Her knees and forehead are together and her face is down.</p>
<p>Her appearance is that of a lost puppy.</p>
<p>She must have thought about it in her own way. She cannot go against her father or the Order. But she has a sense of justice that she wants to resist. Such conflicts tormented her.</p>
<p>And this is the result. She tried to reduce the casualties as much as possible by getting ahead of the troupe members who were forced to fight by being fitted with slave collars.</p>
<p>However, her fatigue had peaked to the point where she could no longer withstand the wyvern&#8217;s attacks.</p>


<p>“Zeid……”</p>


<p>Sheila looks up at me with red eyes.</p>
<p>I know its continuation.</p>


<p>“Please help——“</p>


<p>Therefore, I was going to accept those words.</p>
<p>But Quena interrupted me.</p>


<p>“Oops. Don&#8217;t use the word &#8216;help&#8217; so easily for us adventurers. The only thing you can say to an adventurer is, 『I&#8217;d like to make a request』, you know.”</p>
<p>“…..!”</p>


<p>At first glance, that statement seems cold.</p>
<p>However, it was a salvation for Sheila.</p>
<p>It wasn&#8217;t a ray of hope, but Quena indicated that there was a realistic hope of resolving the situation.</p>


<p>“Zeid too, being an S-rank, don’t make a promise without due consideration”</p>
<p>“Ahahaha…… that’s true. But when you see someone in trouble, you would want to help.”</p>
<p>“Like I said, you’re too nice to people……”</p>


<p>Quena holds her forehead and shakes her head from side to side, 『<em>Yare yare</em>』.</p>
<p>It is what she said.</p>

<p>If I were to help them easily, the guild would not get any requests. <em>Since all they have to do is beg me for help. </em></p>
<p>Then there would be lines of people in front of my house and my mailbox would be flooded with papers asking for help. I don&#8217;t want that situation and neither does the guild.</p>
<p>Hence, I have to say it firmly. 『Please make a request』.</p>
<p>Really, senpai saved me.</p>


<p>“……Request…… I want to make one……!”</p>


<p>Sheila said so, gathering her energy.</p>
<p>Those words came from the bottom of her heart.</p>


<p>“Then, let&#8217;s talk from the request money first.”</p>
<p>“Re,request money. Yes, that&#8217;s right, the first thing is the commission. But I&#8217;m a new knight and I&#8217;m not allowed to spend my family&#8217;s money. &#8230;&#8230; I can only collect about five gold coins &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“What are you saying. It doesn&#8217;t have to be money, you know?”</p>
<p>“It doesn&#8217;t have to be money &#8230;&#8230;?”</p>


<p>Sheila is stunned by Quena&#8217;s words.</p>
<p>She doesn’t know what she means.</p>
<p>Quena looks at Sheila mischievously. <em>It was just like she was licking her from her toes to her head &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>
<p>After doing that far, Sheila finally understood it.</p>
<p>She <em>hah, </em>then covered her body with her hands as if to protect it.</p>


<p>“You’re still young and quite a beautiful girl. If slavery was restored in the kingdom, You would be priceless, you know. If you were auctioned, I think you would easily exceed a thousand gold coins.”</p>


<p>Quena jokes about it, while grinning. Slavery isn&#8217;t back, you know. The knight order is just using the slave collars.</p>
<p>Well, but Sheila is indeed exceptional.</p>
<p>She has big eyes, long eyelashes, peachy, small lips and a beautiful nose. Each strand of her bright golden hair, is fine and flutters easily even in a gentle breeze.</p>
<p>She has a cuteness that won&#8217;t fade away even when her fatigue was visible.</p>
<p>However, I thought that such words were too unscrupulous.</p>


<p>“Oy, the situation is already as it is.”</p>
<p>“I understand, you know. It’s just a sarcasm about this country. I&#8217;m just so angry that I couldn’t control myself to this good-for-nothing superior”</p>


<p>Unusually, Quena seemed angry.</p>
<p>Something must have tugged at her heartstrings.</p>
<p>But Sheila, in contrast, blushed at Quena&#8217;s sarcasm.</p>


<p>“Uh……uhmm……. I,if you’re okay with my body, then…….!”</p>


<p>Sheila made a bold statement.</p>
<p>She withdraws the arm that was hiding her body.</p>
<p>She closes her eyes, turns her face away, and turns her skin bright red from embarrassment.</p>


<p>“Wa,wait a minute. Don&#8217;t take me seriously! You&#8217;re making me feel embarrassed too!”</p>


<p>Even Quena, next to me, is smiling shyly and bitterly.</p>
<p>I thought, &#8220;If that would be the case, you shouldn&#8217;t have said that from the beginning,&#8221; but it was her way of trying to break the stiff and heavy atmosphere. <em>I can’t blame her.</em></p>


<p>&#8220;Bu,but how can have you take on the Knight order of the Kingdom for five gold coins &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“You definitely can’t”</p>
<p>“That’s right, isn’t it……”</p>


<p>Sheila drops her shoulders to Quena&#8217;s flat denial.</p>


<p>“You don&#8217;t have to pay right now, but you have to pay such debt after it was completed, you know. You&#8217;re quite awkward.”</p>
<p>“Ah”</p>


<p>At Quena’s words, Sheila put her hands together.</p>
<p>It seemed that she gets the point.</p>


<p>“Even so, how much should I pay?”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I wonder. We will be facing the military power of a country, so I think you will need to prepare a thousand gold coins.”</p>
<p>“Eh…… Then I really have to pay with my body now. &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;”</p>


<p>When Sheila gets her teary eyes moist, she looks at me.</p>
<p><em>I don&#8217;t want her to look like such a little animal. &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“Five gold coins will suffice. Then make a request. 『Stop the Chivalric order from running amok』.”</p>
<p>“Bu,but”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;ve never felt sorry for leaving the Order.”</p>
<p>“……Eh?”</p>
<p>“But that&#8217;s only for those in the commanding class, with the exception of Sheila. I&#8217;m sorry I left you and my other comrades behind.”</p>
<p>“……That’s”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s just the right opportunity, this is. For me, it&#8217;s a request worth taking, with a payoff of more than five gold coins.”</p>
<p>“Ze,Zeid……”</p>


<p>Sheila sheds tears.</p>


<p>“This guy, is strange, too. I wouldn&#8217;t normally accept a request like this so easily, no matter how much money is offered.”</p>


<p>Quena said something extra.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m sure there&#8217;s nothing strange about it. <em>That&#8217;s painful</em>.</p>
<p>However, maybe she didn&#8217;t hear such words, Sheila snorted without trying to wipe the tears which was spilling from her eyes.</p>


<p>“Thank you …… thank you……! I&#8217;ll definitely repay you &#8230;&#8230; for this favor &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>


<p>I was relieved to see such figure of her.</p>
<p>Those tears of hers are for the Order&#8217;s members. It is something that is being spilled even though it does not cause any damage to her as a commander class.</p>
<p>She’s kind and has a strong sense of justice.</p>
<p>So do the other members. They were not so stupid that they don&#8217;t think about deserting or rebelling. Still, they followed their heart to protect their country, their family, and their friends.</p>
<p>That is why they volunteered to be knights.</p>
<p>There is no way I would allow such people to be hurt and torn to pieces by a selfish upper management outburst.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why this request is absolutely gonna be —— successful.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>It was not until a few days later that I was officially 『commissioned』 by Sheila. Because of the nature of the matter, it was necessary to keep it a secret, so I went directly to Riff, the guild master, to discuss it.</p>
<p>I am still in the Guild Master&#8217;s office on the top floor of the Guild headquarters. And in there, Riff and I were talking about what I had done to prepare for this request in the days since I received it.</p>


<p>“So…… why is Quena even here? Are you trying to party up with Zeid?”</p>


<p>Riff, sitting opposite of me on a sofa placed across from me, said so. I&#8217;m sitting on the couch too, but Quena is standing behind me with her arms crossed.</p>
<p>At Riff&#8217;s remark, Quena hurriedly shook her head.</p>


<p>“It&#8217;s not like that! I just can&#8217;t leave Zeid alone, you know!”</p>
<p>“What, are you in love with him?”</p>
<p>“Tha,that isn’t the case! It is, that. I still have to serve as his guide &#8230;&#8230;! Right!?”</p>
<p>“『Right!?』, you said. I think you are showing a glimpse of your personal feelings when you bring up your duties.”</p>
<p>“How could that happen? There&#8217;s no reason for me to fall in love with him!”</p>
<p>“Do you need a reason to like someone? Well, if I had to say it, maybe he tickled your motherhood. I don&#8217;t know about it, though.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say such inappropriate things!”</p>


<p>Riff&#8217;s teasing brought Quena&#8217;s anger to its peak.</p>
<p>In the end, she was even about to pull out her flaming sword.</p>


<p>“Wait, wait, wait, it’s already good, so let us get on with the story.”</p>
<p>&#8220;Already good!? It&#8217;s not all good!”</p>
<p>“Oy, Riff. Apologize.”</p>
<p>“Ahaha~, I&#8217;m sorry. Forgive me.”</p>


<p>Riff apologized to Quena with a bitter smile on her face, as if she was about to be punished.</p>
<p>She knows that if Quena continues to rampage, the guild&#8217;s headquarters will be in jeopardy. I still don’t know why she was provoking her so much, though. <em>Well, perhaps it is her personality.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“Geez……”</p>


<p>Quena, still with a vein on her forehead, sheathes her sword.</p>


<p>“So what about the request?”</p>


<p>I asked again.</p>
<p>About the request.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m not on the receiving side.</p>
<p>I&#8217;m the one who requested the guild.</p>
<p>I have two requests.</p>


<p>“Ooh. I have already secured the 『Collar of Slavery』 made by the Kingdom. See, here&#8217;s the magic item.”</p>


<p>Riff placed the collar of slavery on the table between hers and my sofa which was on the opposite.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s such a thin, narrow collar that you wouldn&#8217;t notice if you weren&#8217;t told about it beforehand.</p>
<p>However, it remains firmly circular and is surprisingly hard in the hand.</p>
<p>The inside of the collar is not filled with magic power. But when the collar is worn, the wearer&#8217;s magic power is absorbed and it is activated.</p>


<p>“Tentatively, this magic item is prohibited. It mustn&#8217;t be abused, you know?”</p>
<p>“Ah, I know”</p>


<p>While saying so, I put the slave&#8217;s collar around my own neck.</p>
<p>The collar is hard, but it can be expanded. When I pass it through my head and bring it up to my neck, the loose part tightens and adheres closely.</p>
<p>I can feel the magic power being sucked out of me naturally.</p>


<p>“Hey, what are you doing!?”</p>


<p>Quena asked me in a panic.</p>
<p>Ah. I told Riff about it because I had to tell her what it was used for or she wouldn&#8217;t take the request, but I didn&#8217;t tell it to Quena.</p>


<p>“It is in order to find a way to unlock it.”</p>


<p>I put my hand on the collar while saying so.</p>
<p>I watch the flow of magic power.</p>
<p><em>Fumufumu, its structure is like this, huh.</em> I was going to ask them to get the production drawings too, but in the end, this is much easier than looking at the esoteric-looking drawings.</p>
<p>Eventually—— I found a technique that would lead to my release from it.</p>
<p>I instantly poured my magic power that easily exceeds the capacity of the collar into it.</p>
<p>With a click, the collar came off.</p>


<p>“Alright, it’s off”</p>
<p>“Ooh, you did it!”</p>


<p>Riff was pleased as she applauded my art.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Quena&#8217;s cheeks were twitching.</p>


<p>“For argument’s sake, it&#8217;s a magic item that had been built up in an era, you know &#8230;&#8230;. Even demonic beings who are good at magic were captured by it …&#8230;”</p>


<p>There must have been a time like that in the past.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know when it was discontinued or anything, but I&#8217;ve been in the woods all my life and I don&#8217;t know those times, so I couldn&#8217;t understand her.</p>
<p>Quena, who had been speechless, regains her composure and asks me.</p>


<p>“But if that&#8217;s the case, you should have tried it when you were helping Sheila’s people. With as many members as you could.”</p>
<p>“No, no, since I knew that if I broke it, however thin it was, I&#8217;d be exposed.”</p>
<p>“Hmm. I don&#8217;t think that the higher ups in that Order care that much, though.”</p>


<p>Well, that&#8217;s one way to look at it.</p>
<p>But I want to take all the possible precautions.</p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m absolutely determined to accomplish this request.</p>


<p>“And the other request, was to gather a lot of people. They&#8217;ll get together by the scheduled date and time.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that would be great.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? What do you mean by people getting together?”</p>


<p>Quena asked again.</p>


<p>“I asked her to do it. To have the skilled adventurers in various parts of the country.”</p>
<p>“Skilled? ……I wasn’t invited, though?”</p>


<p>Quena smiled and tilted her head as she grabbed my shoulder. <em>Her eyes weren’t smiling.</em></p>


<p>“Aiyo, jealousy is ugly.”</p>
<p>“I,I’m not jealous!”</p>
<p>“Wait, Riff. Don&#8217;t say anything because you&#8217;ll disrupt the conversation again.”</p>


<p>I stop Riff from trying to tease Quena again.</p>
<p>Then I explained why I didn&#8217;t call Quena on my side.</p>


<p>“I didn&#8217;t call Quena because it is based in the kingdom. If I put a strange date here, Quena will be forced to move. I don&#8217;t want you to get involved.”</p>
<p>“……Hmm. Yo,you don&#8217;t need to worry about that!”</p>
<p>“Is that, so? I&#8217;m sorry about that. Could I ask you about it?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha. She&#8217;s hiding her embarrassment in her own way, Zeid.”</p>
<p>“Bah……! Do,don&#8217;t say unnecessary things! Yo,you said you&#8217;ve called in some of the best adventurers from around the world, right. I get the gist of what you&#8217;re trying to do, but how much gold did you spend?”</p>
<p>“A hundred and twenty gold coins, roughly.”</p>


<p>Riff simply told her on my behalf.</p>
<p>This startled Quena.</p>


<p>“Wha! The request achievement money should be worth five gold coins!? Why is that &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“Well, because it&#8217;s all about accomplishing the request. I used all the contract money and all the commission accomplishment money I had to get it done in time.”</p>
<p>“I don&#8217;t think so. Are you saying that it&#8217;s not worth much! Aren’t you making a mistake on something? The reason you receive a request is to make money, you know!?”</p>


<p>Quena&#8217;s face came closer with a devilish look on it.</p>
<p><em>I’m getting embarrassed because she was so beautiful.</em></p>
<p><em> </em></p>
<p>“Ah, I know that, you know. But I told you before. I feel bad for my old comrades and Sheila.”</p>


<p>It also includes my apology.</p>
<p>And.</p>


<p>“I&#8217;ve spent a lot of money, but it feels rewarding. Many times more than when I was a member of the troupe. So, well, I have no regrets.”</p>
<p>“No. I&#8217;m not talking about regrets or anything. &#8230;&#8230; What do I say, there&#8217;s something wrong with your attitude towards work. You’re really different, you”</p>
<p>“Hahahahah! Zeid is a strange guy! He thinks very differently from normal adventurers, alright!”</p>


<p>Quena was amazed, while Riff was laughing, bashing me.</p>
<p><em>Well, that kind of reaction is to be expected.</em></p>


<p>“I don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m going to go this far in the future to accomplish my requests. I would definitely accomplish any request, though. ——This time, it&#8217;s more than that, it&#8217;s a request I&#8217;m willing to use more than a hundred forces to accomplish.”</p>

<p>I told the girls so with firm determination.</p>

︎︎<p style= "text-align:center;"><strong>5: More Than a Hundred Forces</strong></p>

<p>Another few days have passed since Sheila&#8217;s request to save the chivalric order was officially accepted. And the order moved as Sheila had informed them.</p>
<p>The chivalric order of the Kingdom had gathered together, with all the ordinary members wearing slave collars, and they formed a camp near the border with the Holy Republic to wait. There were thousands of them——.</p>

<p>“They&#8217;re trying to start a war, heh”</p>

<p>Quena handed me the telescope she had just finished looking through and said so.</p>

<p>“Ah. According to Sheila, it seemed that the Order decided to go to war on their own, overwhelming the royalty and civil officials. It&#8217;s practically a coup d&#8217;etat.”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s quite miserable that people who are supposed to have pledged their loyalty to their country would overthrow it.”</p>
<p>“Well, they made them wear slave collars. As soon as the top few in the Order turn against them, it would be as if there are no more forces that resist.”</p>

<p>Most of the members of the First, Second, and Third Order are forced to wear slave collars.</p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>They are simply barred of their own will or the danger for their lives.</p>

<p>“But are you sure? The other party is a country &#8230;&#8230; It&#8217;s almost the total strength of one of the great powers in the land, the Kingdom of Kuzera.”</p>
<p>“I understand. And they used to be my comrades. That’s why, why I called them—— to avoid needlessly hurting them.”</p>

<p>A total of several dozen adventurers has gathered further behind me and Quena.</p>
<p>They are skilled adventurers commissioned by Riff.</p>
<p>Moreover, they are all shellfish, mainly from countries that are not on good terms with the thousand countries. Moreover, all of them are mainly active in countries that are not on good terms with the Kingdom.</p>

<p>“Well, it was said that it was an activity unrelated to the guild, but we’ve been paid and talked to by the Guild Master of the Imperial Branch, so we&#8217;ll do our job well.”</p>

<p>The man who said this was a man with thick body hair. He has the same dark hair as me and brown eyes which are common on the continent.</p>
<p>His name is Deidge.</p>
<p>It seems that he is active in the Weila Empire.</p>
<p>He seems to be an adventurer who earns quite a few points at A rank.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_2/article_incontent_2 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>“Yes, that&#8217;s very encouraging.”</p>
<p>“We are no match for you, an S-ranked person. Wait, that’s right. Here, I have brought you this”</p>

<p>Deidge said this while holding out the knight he was carrying in front of me.</p>
<p>The knight was bound with a gag and is roughly tied in a rope.</p>
<p>Blood is coming out of his limbs.</p>
<p>However, these are not the scars that Deidge put on him when he captured him<em>. It doesn&#8217;t mean that the rope is so tight that it causes him to bleed.</em></p>
<p>The knight is resisting with his lightless eyes.</p>
<p>As a result of this, blood oozes from his limbs.</p>

<p>“I&#8217;ve heard the stories, but this is terrible. As soon as they saw us, they attacked us.”</p>
<p>“They were ordered around with the slave collars. They don&#8217;t want to attack you, either.&#8221;</p>
<p>“I see. The kingdom is this disarranged huh”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t heard anything bad about its civil servants or the royal family. It&#8217;s just that its military-related affairs are too outrageous.”</p>
<p>“What’s with that. Isn&#8217;t the royal family doing anything?”</p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>“I heard that it wasn&#8217;t that they weren’t doing anything, but it&#8217;s the commander of the First Order who has the real power. So, as I said before, it&#8217;s a coup d&#8217;etat, this is.”</p>

<p>I put my hand on the group member&#8217;s collar, explaining exactly what I had heard from Riff and Sheila.</p>
<p><em>Thank goodness. It was the same type that one soldier wore.</em></p>
<p>But that&#8217;s not all this time. There is something I want to try.</p>
<p>Magic power is easier to pour if I touch them directly with my hand. However, the difficulty increases when I try to channel magic power into something that is not in contact.</p>
<p>Essentially, being in contact is more reliable and consumes less magic power.</p>
<p>However, there are many knights in slave collars, and it is time-consuming and labor-intensive to touch and release them one by one.</p>
<p>The one I got before has been broken. It was only one, and with that, I will try it in actual combat.</p>
<p>Its magic circuit is similar.</p>
<p>There is no problem with the way of the magic power.</p>
<p>Yup.</p>
<p>His collar came off with a clicking sound.</p>
<p><em>Alright, at close range, I could break it without touching it.</em></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>“That&#8217;s amazing. I know that it&#8217;s a slave collar, albeit a little different from the original. I mean, if you could do tricks like this, you wouldn&#8217;t need us.”</p>
<p>“No, no, I don&#8217;t think I can do it extensively and for large numbers of people yet, though.”</p>
<p>“Haa, I see. So that&#8217;s where we&#8217;ll buy you some time.”</p>
<p>“Yes. That&#8217;s what the job description was. Well, first of all, let’s take down the head of the main group who is giving the orders, but I&#8217;ll take care of that.”</p>

<p>While having a conversation with Didge, the exhausted troupe member&#8217;s eyes lit up and he looked at his surroundings clearly. And as soon as he saw me, he started muttering some kind of words.</p>
<p>He’s gagged so it doesn&#8217;t go through to me clearly.</p>


<p>“I know. I&#8217;ll take it off.”</p>


<p>I remove his gag and rope.</p>
<p>He staggered up without any sign of escape or resistance.</p>


<p>“You’re Zeid-san &#8230;&#8230;.”</p>
<p>“Currently, I&#8217;m the one who came to stop the chivalric order. You must be tired. Please get some rest.”</p>
<p>“……? Ye,yes. Thank you…… very much……”</p>


<p>The troupe member fell asleep in less than a second after saying so.</p>
<p>I still couldn’t believe that they decided to start a war with such exhausted forces. <em>Even if they can move them by force, do they not know that there will be a backlash in the future?</em></p>
<p>Well, we&#8217;re the ones who made the move to prevent that backlash.</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>



<p>“Then let&#8217;s continue. Try not to hurt the members and neutralize them as much as possible.”</p>
<p>“Who are you talking to? Leave it to me.”</p>


<p>“Oh. With guys like these, it&#8217;ll be no problem to play with them.”</p>


<p>He is fully enthusiastic.</p>
<p>Now then, let’s start.</p>


<p>◇</p>


<p>I deploy the detection magic.</p>
<p>Among the many tents erected, I found the one with the commander class.</p>


<p>“First of all, keep the commanding class in check so that they don&#8217;t give them unnecessary orders. All of you are not to neutralize the knights near me, but to neutralize the backup troops that are going to rush in.”</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>



<p>When they get closer, I’ll just release their collar of slavery.</p>
<p>The farther away the magic is, the harder it is to pass through.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s where the adventurers I commissioned come in. I asked the adventurers to neutralize the knights who will be caught by the sounds of battle from all over the encampment which will come to support their comrades.</p>
<p>That way, I can effectively keep the commander class in check.</p>
<p>So with that.</p>


<p>“““Roger”””</p>


<p>Quena, Didge, and the other adventurers nodded.</p>
<p>Each of them seems to be ready.</p>


<p>“Then let the operation start.”</p>


<p>At my signal, they all take off at once.</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>As planned, I headed towards the commander class by myself.</p>
<p>The other adventurers also seemed to be doing a good job of holding them back.</p>
<p>I release the collars of the approaching knights and incapacitate them.</p>
<p>After repeating that much work, I arrived at the commander class tent.</p>
<p>There are quarreling voices from the inside. But I have already figured that out too.</p>
<p>The detection magic that I had deployed had allowed me to see Sheila&#8217;s exchange. The people she was arguing with are of the commanding class, including the Commander of the First Order.</p>
<p><em>Perhaps it can be resolved without my outright intervention. </em></p>
<p>With this in mind, I peeked through the gap in the tent. I have no hobbies of eavesdropping or snooping. However, rather than meddling in the matter, I have decided that if they could solve the problem within their own people, I should let them do so.</p>


<p>“……Therefore, please change your mind!”</p>


<p>Sheila is talking to Rande.</p>
<p>Rande stared abominably at Sheila. The look in his eyes —— it was like he was looking at an object.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t know what kind of look one should be getting at from their own family.</p>
<p>But that of Rande should not have been directed at his own daughter.</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>I was often told by my commanding officer not to mix public and private life. However, Rande&#8217;s line of sight cannot even be sent in 『public』…… it’s murderous eyes.</p>


<p>“Release the collar of slavery? Don&#8217;t invade the Holy Republic? Apologize to the royalty and civilian officials? Sheila &#8230;&#8230; When did you become so incompetent?”</p>


<p>Incompetent.</p>
<p><em>He even came up with such a word, huh. </em>Sheila should still be in her late teens. She is not too young. But if you&#8217;re asking me if she’s old enough to be an adult, I&#8217;m not so sure.</p>
<p>I wonder why he is doing such abuse of human resources that are in the process of growing. <em>Even if it&#8217;s his job, he shouldn&#8217;t say it. &#8230;&#8230;</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;ve seen adventurers who have failed in the guild.</p>
<p>But their first concern was whether they got injured. The guild opens its healing stations to adventurers free of charge.</p>
<p>After that, they simply reconfirm the request and ask why they have failed it.</p>
<p>They never curse. They would say something like 『We are just glad that you came back alive. Good luck next time! 』, such warm words. <em>I just had a senior adventurer say to me, </em><em>『</em><em>What&#8217;s wrong with you, I&#8217;m going to train you!! </em><em>』</em><em>, then she took care of me from there, though.</em></p>
<p>Still, I felt love in those words.</p>
<p>There is no love in Rande&#8217;s words.</p>


<p>“A proud daughter who graduated from the Knight Training Academy at the top of her class&#8230;&#8230; I thought you were like that, but I didn&#8217;t realize how useless you would be in real battles. The situation is changing at a dizzying rate! You have to adapt to each matter as it comes!”</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&#8220;Even using the prohibited magic item!?”</p>
<p>“Correct”</p>
<p>“Even if it hurts other people unnecessarily!?”</p>
<p>“It&#8217;s not unnecessary. They’re necessary sacrifices.”</p>
<p>“That is unnecessary! Why did you attack the Holy Republic!”</p>
<p>“Because they have been doing some suspicious activity against the kingdom.”</p>
<p>“We are allies, you know! Just because the Knights of the Holy Republic move near the border, without confirming it out, we take it as a hostile action. &#8230;&#8230;! Perhaps you just wanted their territory!?”</p>


<p><em>Uwah.</em></p>
<p>It feels like I&#8217;m listening to a great coming out.</p>
<p>If what Sheila is saying was true, then he was expending the knight as a private tool. For his own wealth.</p>


<p>“……Sheila. Your behavior is beyond reproachful.&#8221;</p>
<p>“Wha!?”</p>

<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>Rande, Baran, and the others pointed their swords at Sheila. The looks on everyone&#8217;s faces were not good. It isn’t that of a menace or whatsoever.</p>
<p>They are seriously trying to get rid of Sheila.</p>
<p><em>I think I can go out now. Let&#8217;s go save Sheila.</em> That&#8217;s what I thought.</p>
<p>But —— Sheila hasn’t drawn her sword.</p>
<p>She is still trying to convince them. Those hopeless men who don&#8217;t think of people as humans.</p>


<p>“Why is that &#8230;&#8230;! Was the smile you gave me when I was a child a lie! Father!”</p>
<p>“Smile……? Ah, at that time, I thought you could firmly 『distinguish between people and things』.”</p>
<p>“————”</p>


<p>Sheila&#8217;s face turns into the color of despair.</p>
<p>She shook her legs and wondered if what she had seen so far has been an illusion.</p>
<p>She was on her knees with no more strength.</p>
<p>Even her heart to hold her sword has already shattered——&#8230;&#8230;</p>

<p>“——that’s enough”</p>


<p>I appear in front of Sheila.</p>
<p>Sheila&#8217;s face is behind me, so I can&#8217;t see her, but I can understand that she trembles herself as if she was getting in order. <em>She was frightened to her core.</em></p>
<p>I could feel the back of her teeth making a guttural, dull sound.</p>
<p>I wonder why did I hide and watch Sheila&#8217;s persuasion. Didn’t I already know it. In front of me, the guys who were pointing their swords at just one girl in a group —— was simply rotten.</p>


<p>“Ze——”</p>


<p>Baran tries to say my name. It&#8217;s a natural reaction. For him to react first was probably because he met me in the Holy Republic and it was fresh in his memory.</p>
<p><em>Unpleasant</em>. That’s what I thought.</p>


<p>“——Don&#8217;t speak anymore. It can&#8217;t be helped, since you have a zombie-like rotten smell.”</p>


<p>I hit Baran with my fist. I didn’t need magic. He ripped through the tent and flew with great vigor.</p>

<p>The others are standing there in a dumbfounded state at my sudden appearance.</p>


<p>“Wha,what are you”</p>
<p>“I told you not to speak.”</p>


<p>I kick to the ground a man who is probably that of a commander&#8217;s class who opened his mouth without learning his lesson. I forgot his name. Although I don&#8217;t need to remember it anymore. <em>The ground is cracked.</em></p>
<p>I look around at all of them briefly. Everyone had their mouths tightly closed. In order to not make a voice.</p>


<p>“Ah, that’s good. Don&#8217;t ever open your mouth again.”</p>


<p>There’s no one who tries to say anything.</p>
<p>Having seen the precedent of the two men, I guess their instincts would shut them down if they tried to open their mouths even half-heartedly. Their faces are pale and the tips of their swords are also pointed to the ground, losing their will to fight.</p>
<p>Except for one person.</p>


<p>“Zeiiiiiiiid!!”</p>


<p>Rande raised his voice so loudly that it echoed throughout the camp.</p>


<p>“——I told you to shut up, though”</p>


<p>I picked up the commander&#8217;s sword, which he had just knocked to the ground, and threw its hilt into Rande&#8217;s mouth.</p>
<p>A dull thud echoes from the hilt hitting his teeth. The sword sheathed in it falls to the ground as it was. A lot of blood spills out of Rande&#8217;s mouth.</p>


<p>Even so, with a “Fugah,fugah!”, I kicked him in the chest, and made him fall to the ground.</p>


<p>“You, do you know why I came here?”</p>
<p>“N,no……?”</p>
<p>“I told you not to speak, though.”</p>
<p>“Gugah!”</p>


<p>I closed his mouth, which was still open, with my foot.</p>
<p><em>That&#8217;s unreasonable, isn&#8217;t it</em>; I take one glance at the commanders who look at me with such eyes but don&#8217;t try to touch me. They all quickly looked away.</p>


<p>“Do you know why you guys didn&#8217;t notice me until I got here?”</p>


<p>I asked again, but no one seemed to be able to come up with an answer, and they all remained frightened, and were tilting their heads with a 『?』.</p>


<p>“Would you understand if you look at this?”</p>


<p>I said so and took the collar out of my pocket.</p>
<p>It was the 『Collar of Slavery』 borrowed from a disarmed member of the troupe.</p>


<p>“Because if I take this off, no one will want to report to you. Because they don&#8217;t want to fight me.”</p>


<p>I drop the collar of slavery on the ground and stomp on it.</p>


<p>“““!?”””</p>


<p>The faces of the commander-class guys turn pale like a dead man.</p>
<p>But there was no commotion. Because I&#8217;m blocking their words.</p>
<p>They’re like clowns doing a silent act. <em>It&#8217;s not funny at all, though.</em></p>


<p>“I&#8217;m not so arrogant to impose sanctions from my side. Since the request I received was to 『Save the Chivalric Order』. So even while I’m doing this, with detection magic and magic power remote control —— I’ll release the collars of the troupe members.”</p>


<p>I think we are finally about halfway through the group members who are being fitted with it now. If I focus on a few and take my time, I can remove it without seeing the collar itself.</p>


<p>“Most of them seem to have collapsed from exhaustion. But I guess some of them aren&#8217;t.”</p>


<p>Hundreds of people, only a small 『Part』 of the Order, have rallied to this tent which I sensed with detection magic.</p>
<p>Finally, the first one arrived.</p>


<p>“Our companions…… our friends who vowed to leave the village together and protect the country…… return them!!”</p>


<p>The guy&#8217;s body was in tatters. As well as his external injuries, some parts of his body do not have magic power. <em>Perhaps he was necrotic. (TN: Good lord)</em></p>
<p>But the first thing he mentioned with a grudge was for his friend.</p>
<p>The knight who came in following him was holding a broken necklace around his neck.</p>


<p>“My mother &#8230;&#8230; you didn&#8217;t even let me see her death …&#8230;! Why &#8230;&#8230;! I wanted to protect my family as much as I wanted to protect this country&#8230;&#8230;.!”</p>


<p>One after another.</p>
<p>With individual origin.</p>
<p>Before I know it, they start to gather.</p>
<p>All of them were putting all their strength into the swords they drew.</p>
<p>From here on, the commanding class group will simply be punished.</p>
<p>It is time for them to realize the weight of the sins they have accumulated.</p>


<p>“Stand up, Sheila”</p>


<p>I reach out my hand to Sheila, who remains motionless on her knees.</p>
<p>Sheila&#8217;s eyes are red. She looks weaker and more exhausted than when I met her at the Wyvern’s case.</p>
<p><em>Rande and his company disparage such a girl in this condition, huh.</em></p>


<p>“Ze……id…… I …… didn&#8217;t know &#8230;&#8230; father and the others, really think for the country from the bottom of their hearts &#8230;&#8230; that’s what I thought……”</p>


<p>Sheila said so, while facing down, without the power to take my hand.</p>
<p>Ah, I know.</p>
<p>Therefore, I think I understand how desperate she was. Still, I can&#8217;t gauge Sheila&#8217;s feelings when she learned of her own parents&#8217; wrongdoings, though.</p>
<p>But she will be guilt-ridden for being here. <em>I&#8217;m not going to let them drive her to the wall any further.</em></p>


<p>“——Let&#8217;s go, Sheila”</p>
<p>“……Zeid……”</p>


<p>She looked at me with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>Sheila takes my hand. She has a lot of strength in her hand, but she can&#8217;t seem to get up on her own.</p>
<p>It’s lighter on my part, so I try not to pull too much.</p>
<p>I supported Sheila who was about to fall while standing up.</p>


<p>“Wa,wait…… please…… save me……!”</p>


<p>Shivering and shuddering at the knights approaching one after another, Rande calls for help.</p>
<p>Sheila, who saw that with her hollow eyes&#8230;&#8230; turned away.</p>
<p>I understand that Sheila, doesn&#8217;t want to appraise him anymore.</p>
<p>In exchange.</p>


<p>“I told you not to speak. You should not do anything more to get on my nerves. ……Or rather, don&#8217;t feel afraid of the troupe members who are already so weak. Don&#8217;t all Commander-sans have such great accomplishments that they are heralded as 『Heroes』?”</p>
<p>“……A……aaaahhh…… aaaaaaahhhhhhhh!”</p>


<p>I told him. Don&#8217;t get on my nerves.</p>
<p>Rande&#8217;s exclamation marked the beginning. The members of the troupe, holding their swords, slashed him all at once. By the time I walked out of the tent, supporting Sheila, the screams had turned into shrieks.</p>
<p>I have learned something from confronting Rande and Baran as enemies.</p>
<p>The Knight Commander class is reasonably competent, but not powerful enough to slay a hundred dragons or hold back an imperial army by themselves.</p>
<p>Perhaps they were simply manipulating their impressions. They are just exaggerating their abilities to control their subordinates. If the ordinary members of the troupe were to band together, they should be able to win enough.</p>
<p>——I found that the magic of the commander-class bunch was disappearing with detection magic. Baran that flew far away is already——.</p>
<p>But now, Sheila shouldn&#8217;t know that.</p>
<p>This does not mean that Sheila shouldn’t be aware of this.</p>
<p>Right now, it’s just the 『Chivalric Order’s Salvation』 ——just seeing the end.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>A smarter person would not have chosen such a salvation.</p>
<p>A more benign person would have thought of a way to save everyone.</p>
<p>If the story were more full of dreams and hopes, such a knighthood would never have been created in the first place.</p>
<p>However, I am me.</p>
<p>Five years after I was born, I was left in a forest that even the best adventurers rarely go near, and when I finally managed to escape, I was abused.</p>
<p>I could only learn common sense and language by talking to the members of the troupe. My swordsmanship and magic are all self-taught. If I look at the textbooks, I will find completely different descriptions.</p>
<p>This is what happens when one isn’t upright.</p>
<p>At the Guild Master&#8217;s office. ——I came here to talk about the accomplishment of the request that was executed in secret.</p>


<p>“I heard that the kingdom has reached a turning point.&#8221;</p>


<p>Riff said so while picking sweets.</p>
<p>Her words were spot on.</p>
<p>The chivalric order of the kingdom had virtually collapsed. This was my 『salvation』.</p>
<p>Those above the rank of commander were either killed in the civil war, or were condemned to death for attempting to provoke a coup d&#8217;etat.</p>
<p>Ninety percent of the order&#8217;s members left the knighthood and returned to their hometowns, became adventurers, mercenaries, or took up a profession, or went in a direction unrelated to knighthood.</p>
<p>The remaining 10% are still struggling to rebuild the Chivalric Order despite the tragedy that took place.</p>
<p>However, that has also been weakened in this way.</p>
<p>Naturally —— 30% of the kingdom&#8217;s territory was encroached upon by other countries and other races. No, I would rather say that they are glad that it was only at 30%.</p>
<p>The king and his civil officials, who were bashed for 『carelessly mismanaging the knight order with corruption』, changed generations, throwing away most of their wealth to hire adventurers and mercenaries to prevent the invasion.</p>


<p>“This is also all the fault of some guy who went wild with all his might.”</p>
<p>“We,well, I was still holding back, though &#8230;&#8230;”</p>


<p>Quena tells me that I did that too excessively.</p>
<p>I also wanted to have settled this peacefully &#8230;&#8230; I just wanted the commanders to reflect on what they’ve done. &#8230;&#8230;</p>
<p>Sometimes, I wish I was more dexterous. &#8230;&#8230;</p>


<p>“Zeid”</p>


<p>Sheila was in this room as well.</p>
<p>She too —— got out of the Order.</p>
<p>I know the cause. She has nothing but bad memories of the Order. If she remains, Sheila herself will broke.</p>
<p>It’s quite irresponsible, an irresponsible person might get slanders.</p>
<p>But she tried to fulfill her duty in her own way. As a result of that, I destroyed the Order. It shattered the ideals she had envisioned.</p>
<p>In other words, I&#8217;m the bad guy.</p>
<p>If she wants to blame me, blame me. But I did what I was asked to do.</p>


<p>“Sheila —— even if you blame me ——“</p>
<p>“Don’t be dispirited. You can pick up my boobs”</p>


<p>Muniya, then she grabs my hand and puts it on her plump chest——.</p>


<p>“——Eh, what are you doing, Sheila! My hand! My hand is on your chest!”</p>
<p>“Yup. Because I belong to you.”</p>
<p>“N,n,nonono! As I said, that talk is already good……!”</p>


<p>After resigning from the kingdom’s Knight Order, Sheila no longer had an object to which she could devote her loyalty to.</p>
<p>It was at that time.</p>
<p>Quena had told her that I had requested the guild and pay a lot of money —— my entire fortune —— to secure the collar of slavery.</p>
<p>Then Sheila &#8220;I found someone &#8230;&#8230; to whom I pledge my loyalty &#8230;&#8230;! I once swore my loyalty to the kingdom, and I couldn&#8217;t protect it, but &#8230;&#8230; it didn&#8217;t work, but this time, I&#8217;ll get it done, so &#8230;&#8230; make me your knight!&#8221; said that to me —— in this condition.</p>


<p>“Zeid…… don’t want me to be a knight &#8230;&#8230;? I was a knight who couldn&#8217;t defend so &#8230;&#8230; it’s fine, right……?”</p>


<p>Sheila looks at me with a wistful upward glance.</p>
<p>……Kuh! Thi,this is no good……!</p>
<p>My heart jumps when I see such a beautiful girl (with big tits) staring at me &#8230;&#8230;!</p>
<p>Wait. I can feel her heart beating from the touch of my hand. &#8230;&#8230; This is &#8230;&#8230; Sheila&#8217;s &#8230;&#8230;&#8230;&#8230; this girl also has her heart beating ridiculously fast! If you&#8217;re not used to it, don&#8217;t do it!!</p>
<p>I mean! Or rather!</p>
<p>S,stustu,stupid of me; I&#8217;m all focused on the feel of my hands, calm down me!</p>
<p>That&#8217;s right, for the time being, let’s engage it once and think about it——.</p>
<p>——Poh.</p>
<p>There’s a sword covered in flames of tremendous firepower around my neck. &#8230;&#8230;</p>


<p>“Qu,Quena……?”</p>


<img src="https://i.ibb.co/ZxwHvJD/178714.jpg" alt="178714" border="0"></a><br /><a >


<p>“Get your hands off of her. You filth &#8230;&#8230;”</p>
<p>“A,a’re. You have such a character!?”</p>
<p>“That’s no good! Zeid was dejected. This is all because of the burden I have put on him&#8230;&#8230;. I can&#8217;t even give him the request money satisfactorily &#8230;&#8230; That’s why, I&#8217;m going to spend the rest of my life on him!”</p>
<p>“Sheila! Don&#8217;t make this conversation so complicated! I mean, every time you say a word, the flames of Quena&#8217;s sword gains more and more momentum! Ouch!”</p>
<p>“O~y. If you&#8217;re going to flirt, why don&#8217;t you do it at home, you youngsters”</p>


<p>Riff is looking at our direction with her elbows on the table. But despite her words, she is smiling.</p>


<p>“You&#8217;re having fun, right! Stop them!”</p>

<p>Dad, Mom.</p>
<p>This is the result of you guys leaving me in the woods.</p>
<p>I survived the forest with the thought of dying, I survived the Knight Order with the thought of dying, and finally —— I may die in the guild.</p>

<p>“I said get your hand off of herrrrr! Zeeeeeeeeeeeiiiiiiiid!!”</p>
<p>“No! Zeid wants to fondle my breasts!!!”</p>
<p>“Kuhahahahahaha! I,if you want to make out, do it at home! Kububububububu&#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
