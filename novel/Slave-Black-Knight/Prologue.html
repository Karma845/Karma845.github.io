<h3>Prologue</h3>


<p>I’m Zeid.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t have a last name. It&#8217;s just Zeid.</p>
<p>My parents were not noblemen, nor were they great merchants. I think.</p>
<p>Why do I 『think』 that?</p>
<p>That&#8217;s because I don&#8217;t know much about my parents.</p>
<p>My parents took me out to the forest when I was about five years old. But in that forest, my parents were eaten alive by monsters.</p>
<p>As my parents had told me, I ran away and survived in the forest for about a decade.</p>
<p>How did I survive?</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p>I killed monsters, and then I ate them.</p>
<p>Of course, in the beginning, it was just small animals that even a weak person could kill, or a goblin that was working alone.</p>
<p>It didn&#8217;t taste good. On the contrary, it broke my stomach. I was spewing filth all over the place, from above and below.</p>
<p>But gradually, I got used to it.</p>
<p>As I understood the topography of the forest, I comprehended where to find the fruits, so I found something sweet to eat.</p>
<p>Hence, well, I guess I was about fifteen years old when I escaped from the forest huh. I was finally able to return to a human village.</p>
<p>I remember them being pretty frightened.</p>
<p>Who wouldn&#8217;t be if they saw a costume made from the skin of a monster or animal, ripped off and spliced together?</p>
<p>I wasn&#8217;t hostile, but the kids cried, the ones who smelled it threw up, and eventually the Chivalric Order was called and I was captured.</p>
<p>Why didn&#8217;t I explain myself?</p>
<p>It had been so long since I&#8217;d seen people from the same race that I forgot my words. Because the last time I spoke was when I was five years old.</p>
<p>I was so desperate for survival that I never opened my mouth for conversation.</p>
<p>Ah, this is what I heard later.</p>
<p>I was wondering the same thing, too. Why didn&#8217;t help come into the forest? I wondered why I didn&#8217;t meet people in the forest.</p>
<p>The forest I was in seemed to be a place called the 『Forbidden Forest Depths』, an area designated as S rank.</p>
<p>How did I stay alive in such a place, I thought to myself.</p><div class='code-block code-block-4 ai-viewport-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378219"></div>
</div>

<p>At the same time, I wondered why my parents had taken me to such a place and been eaten alive by monsters.</p>
<p>I can&#8217;t confirm those things because they had passed away, though.</p>
<p>Now then, the main subject is from here.</p>
<p>I was captured and quietly thrown into a facility as a prisoner, where I was given food and moderate exercise, as was told by the chivalric order —— I wasn’t allowed to be indulgent.</p>
<p>For some reason, instead of the Knight order, I was forced to participate in skirmishes with neighboring countries and dragon subjugations.</p>
<p>Well, that&#8217;s nothing compared to what I experienced in the forest, though.</p>
<p>The problem is that I am forced to do this every single day, and in the worst cases, I am not allowed to sleep for a week.</p>
<p>No, it&#8217;s tough, alright.</p>
<p>Nn?</p>
<p>Why do I still keep going as it is?</p>
<p>Well, well, that&#8217;s right.</p>
<p>Because I&#8217;m still a member of the Chivalric Order.</p>


<p>“Zeid! What are you being absent-minded for!”</p>

<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>A shout of rage falls on me.</p>
<p>It came from the leader of the First Order to which I belonged, Rande Isla.</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/NFJ0TFK/178708.jpg" alt="178708" border="0"></a>

<p>He has blond hair, blue eyes, and a sturdy body.</p>
<p>According to the stories, he has a history of defeating 100 dragons all at once and has single-handedly fought off an invasion by a powerful empire. He’s what you call a <em>man of valor </em>guy.</p>


<p>“You&#8217;re not getting carried away because you&#8217;re allowed to stay by my side, are you!? The mission from now on is for the good of the country! Put your mind to it!!”</p>


<p>Rande&#8217;s words are always the same.</p>
<p>The second thing he said was that it was for the good of the country.</p>
<p><em>Haa……</em></p>
<p>No matter how much loyalty you show to us, you&#8217;re not going to force us to go that far.</p>
<p>Because we – have already been working for three days without sleep.</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_4 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>The members of the Order around me also have dark circles in their eyes and are walking around like dying zombies.</p>
<p>On the contrary, the dozens or so faces I remember seeing on yesterday&#8217;s mission have disappeared.</p>
<p>Were they able to escape to the medical team? Or were they taken by the Grim Reaper? It will be a long time before I know about it. <em>There are many things that I don&#8217;t know in the first place, though.</em></p>
<p>Ah, by the way, it&#8217;s only us, the regular group members, who work tirelessly.</p>
<p>However, the other members of the group had collapsed and were carried away, or worked in shifts depending on the degree of their exhaustion, and I was the only one who was able to complete tasks without having any incident.</p>
<p>The leader of the group, Rande, had just joined us. It&#8217;s rare that I see him working, since I only see him once a month.</p>
<p>I can almost imagine it.</p>
<p>I’m thinking that he woke up well this morning, had a meal, and came to work feeling good.</p>
<p>That&#8217;s why, he can cut us off as if it was other people&#8217;s affairs.</p>


<p>“Father, they&#8217;re already tired from the day&#8217;s work, and also at the time for the march…… And when it comes to Zeid, he&#8217;s clearly overworked. No matter how much Zeid is …&#8230;”</p>


<p>Then, a voice of salvation was extended to me.</p>
<p>It’s from the deputy leader of the First Chivalric Order, Sheila Isla.</p>
<p>She is a beautiful girl with blonde hair that reaches to her shoulders, blue eyes, and skin that is visibly white despite being baked by the sun.</p>
<p>She joined the Chivalric Order a few months ago and quickly rose to the rank of deputy leader.</p>
<p>It is said that she has outstanding abilities, and boasts speeds that are beyond the realm of the human species.</p>
<p>By the way, I have never seen the power of their Commander and Vice Commander-class.</p>
<p>Since it&#8217;s always us ordinary members who fight on the front lines.</p>

<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p>“What do you mean. These guys will be going to fight. What are they doing with that kind of physical strength!”</p>
<p>“That is……. At least we too”</p>
<p>“Don&#8217;t worry about it! We&#8217;re here for times when these guys can&#8217;t move. Let’s probe when it’s time to move! Of course, let me say it. I&#8217;ll also ascertain it. When it’s time to move, this me will”</p>


<p>Rande says confidently.</p>
<p><em>Haa……</em></p>
<p>I wonder when will I be able to sleep again.</p>
<p>This Order is too black.</p>


︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>


<p>Then a week passed since then.</p>
<p>To be honest, time seemed to pass slowly until about the third day, but from the fourth day on, the days passed as if it was warped.</p>
<p>That’s why, it&#8217;s not uncommon for me to find myself asleep in bed. Or rather, that&#8217;s exactly what I’m doing right now.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t return much, so my room has moss growing around the windows. Usually, one room is given to every ten people, but I&#8217;m the only one who has a little room for exclusive use.</p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>I think Sheila was the one who asked to have it prepared for me.</p>


<p>『Zeid is being forced to work too hard! I&#8217;m certain he has the ability, so please reward him accordingly&#8230;&#8230;. At the very least, make sure he has a place where he can relax by himself! 』</p>


<p>It was something like that.</p>
<p>I was grateful for the offer, but since I didn&#8217;t have time to clean the room, I thought it would be better to stay in my old shared room where my roommate could take care of things to some extent.</p>
<p>If someone who doesn&#8217;t have a high tolerance comes into this room, he or she won&#8217;t last more than a minute. The musty smell, the dust that spreads just by me walking, the moss that grows lively on the window.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t like it either. But I have no choice. I don&#8217;t have the time or energy to clean it.</p>
<p>Then.</p>
<p>A visitor appeared in the room.</p>
<p>No, but it’s not a regular visitor.</p>
<p>Because they did not appear through the door, but through the window.</p>


<p>“Who is it?”</p>
<p>“Hou. You&#8217;re good at noticing things even from a <em>lying face-down</em> position. As expected of the only one I recognized”</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>“It&#8217;s not just about me lying face down. I&#8217;m also tired from working for a week straight.”</p>
<p>“Oh my. The environment is really that harsh, huh”</p>


<p>I heard a painful sadness in a very young voice.</p>
<p>It seems that they weren’t a regular visitor after all. —— Since they didn&#8217;t know the environment of this Order.</p>
<p>Curiously, I turn my head to the side and catch a glimpse at them with only one eye.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s the time I&#8217;m sleeping, but it&#8217;s not at night, it&#8217;s midday.</p>
<p>The sun was shining so brightly that my eyes felt like they were about to close, but I managed to hold it in and get used to it.</p>
<p>Then, I finally saw the voice owner’s figure.</p>
<p>It was a small shadow perched on the window.</p>
<p>They had long, thin, knee-length purple hair and big, golden eyes that looked like the sun —— it was a cute little girl.</p>


<p>“Who, are you”</p>
<p>“I am the guild master Riff. I&#8217;m here to recruit you!”</p>
<p>“…………Is that so”</p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“Why, your reaction is quite light”</p>


<p>Guild.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard of it. It is the organization that my former colleague used to work for before they joined the group.</p>
<p>It is said that they mediate various requests to those who are called adventurers. I heard that they have a system where you get paid if you fulfill a request.</p>
<p>I was somewhat curious, but my colleague ascended to heaven after deserting the Order the next day, so I couldn&#8217;t hear her story about it.</p>


<p>“Well, anything is fine, but don&#8217;t go into the Chivalric Order&#8217;s grounds without permission. Your parents might be worried about you, so hurry up and go home.”</p>
<p>“Muh. You don&#8217;t believe me, do you?”</p>
<p>“On the contrary, how am I supposed to believe it. Speaking of Guild master, they&#8217;re the most important people in the guild, right? What kind of organization would put a kid as young as five years old in charge of being the guild master?”</p>
<p>“I&#8217;m not five years old! Don&#8217;t judge me by my looks!”</p>


<p>The little girl was getting angry cutely.</p>
<p>Her skin looks soft, elastic, and smooth without any wrinkles. Shining eyes that seem to know no filth. &#8230;&#8230; She&#8217;s a little girl no matter where I look.</p>

<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“Then, ask the people there. About 『How old do you think I am? 』. Because everyone but the crazy guys will say that you’re under ten.”</p>
<p>“Now that you mention it&#8230;&#8230; I have to admit so. However! I am not five years old!”</p>
<p>“……Is that right. Well, whatever. Then you&#8217;re a fine adult.”</p>


<p>I can&#8217;t even spare time to compete with kids here.</p>
<p>I close my eyes and go back to sleep.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t want to waste my time dealing with the other party. I need to get some sleep now.</p>


<p>“You don&#8217;t think I&#8217;m an adult, do you? Alright, just listen to my story for now.”</p>


<p>Her voice suddenly became serious.</p>
<p>I wouldn’t have listened to her at all if she had the same tension as before, but the gap made me listen to her.</p>


<p>“As I said before, Zeid. I&#8217;m here to recruit you in person.”</p>
<p>“……”</p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>“I&#8217;ve been turned down many times, but I&#8217;ve come to see you with the intention of doing it for the last time. I&#8217;m sorry for my thinking. But I believe this is not the place for you to spread your wings.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“I have prepared a hundred gold coins as contract money. Of course, if you join the guild, we&#8217;ll also prepare an S-rank registry for you.”</p>
<p>“……”</p>
<p>“How is it, can you at least give me one answer?”</p>


<p>She must have come down from the window and approached me. I asked the little girl, whose voice became closer as if clinging to me.</p>


<p>“One thing, when you say you&#8217;ve been turned down a lot, what are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“I was trying to recruit you through the chivalric order, but&#8230;&#8230; didn&#8217;t you turn it down? That’s what the stories from the knights tell me, though?”</p>
<p>“Only work, leftover food, and the god of death have come for me.”</p>
<p>“……I&#8217;ve been hearing about this for a while, but I guess the Kingdom’s chivalric order is corrupt huh”</p>


<p>The little girl told a very vivid story.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve heard stories about the outside working environment from other members many times. It seemed to be quite good, though there may be some memory correction in me. On top of that, he also said that the Chivalric order is in a rather savage environment.</p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>



<p>&#8220;If I could, I also want to get out of the chivalric order, you know. But I&#8217;m a prisoner held by the Order, and I have to work as a member of the Order. I don&#8217;t even know what to do.”</p>


<p>Inadvertently, I vomited such a weak sound and complaint.</p>
<p>I found that kind of magnanimity in the little girl ……or maybe not.</p>


<p>“Fufuhn. rest assured. I&#8217;ll do everything I can. Since all I needed was Zeid&#8217;s word.”</p>
<p>“……?”</p>


<p>I felt a pang of doubt as the little girl said so confidently.</p>

︎<p style= "text-align:center;">◇◇◇</p>

<p>After a while, the door was opened.</p>
<p>With a powerful sound effect of &#8220;bang&#8221;. The door was unlocked from the start, so there was no privacy whatsoever.</p>

<p>“Zeid, come!”</p>


<p>It was not a member of the order who always came to wake me up, but Rande, the leader of the First Chivalric Order.</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t think he&#8217;d come all this way to wake me up&#8230;&#8230; what does he want me to do today, conquer a continent?</p>


<p>“What will we do?”</p>
<p>“Just come! Don&#8217;t be sluggish!”</p>
<p>“……haa”</p>


<p>I wonder how long they let me sleep.</p>
<p>One hour&#8230;&#8230; No, judging by the angle of the light coming through the window, I should have slept for about three hours.</p>
<p>When I was in the forest, I spent most of my time without sleep because I was scared to death every day. It had been a good experience. <em>I need to rethink whether it&#8217;s a good experience, though.</em></p>
<p><em>What kind of work is that&#8230;&#8230; I need more sleep &#8230;&#8230;</em> I followed his back, thinking what to do, and arrived at a room I had never been to before.</p>



<p>“Where am I?”</p>
<p>“……”</p>


<p>Rande didn&#8217;t answer. He seemed to be in a very bad mood.</p>
<p>However, looking up, there was a sign saying 『Common Room』. I think it was a place to talk about something. <em>Why am I being summoned to this place?</em></p>
<p>I walked into the room, wondering what to expect.</p>
<p>There were two sofas facing each other, with an expensive looking black table in the middle.</p>
<p>And on one side of the sofa, there&#8217;s the cute little girl I&#8217;ve seen somewhere&#8230;&#8230; ——Ah, she was Riff, the self-proclaimed Guild master who had come in from somewhere.</p>
<p>And Sheira was sitting on the other side.</p>


<p>“Take a seat”</p>


<p>Rande said to me, looking over to the side where Riff was. <em>Is he telling me to sit on the couch on Riff&#8217;s side?</em></p>
<p><em>……What is it, what is it?</em></p>
<p>I can sit down? I wonder what is he, a demon who orders me to stand all day long with my feet shoulder-width apart, talking about.</p>
<p>I looked at the sofa to see if there was some kind of magic circle on it, but there didn&#8217;t seem to be any traps.</p>
<p>I sit down, understanding that I am safe for the time being.</p>


<p>I was prepared for such &#8220;Who gave you permission to sit down!?&#8221; unreasonable criticism.</p>
<p>But contrary to my expectation, Rande also sat on Sheila&#8217;s side and glared at Riff. I don&#8217;t think he was going to say anything to me.</p>
<p>I mean, how can he be looking like that at a little girl who is not even old enough to be his wife? <em>It has a momentum that could even kill a person.</em></p>
<p>That Riff looked at me as if I had nothing to worry about and smiled contentedly.</p>


<p>“It&#8217;s been a while, Zeid”</p>


<p>I was half-asleep at that time so I don&#8217;t remember her quite well. But I do remember our meeting and our conversation to some extent.</p>
<p>I think carefully from there.</p>
<p><em>&#8230;&#8230; This situation, by no means.</em></p>


<p>&#8220;Then, is it okay for Zeid to leave the chivalric order?”</p>


<p>Riff suddenly said.</p>
<p>In response, Rande, with veins in his forehead, slammed the table as hard as he could and said loudly enough to spit all over it.</p>


<p>“You said that it was after listening to Zeid&#8217;s talk first!!”</p>


<p><em>Whoa.</em></p>
<p>I&#8217;m a little freaked out by his sudden outburst. But I&#8217;m used to it, so my heart didn&#8217;t jump.</p>
<p>Sheila is pretty startled about it, though. Even though he is her real father &#8230;&#8230; <em>No, I guess it&#8217;s just that he&#8217;s her own father and she doesn&#8217;t remember ever seeing him so angry.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s good for you to remember that Rande is often switched on just before he rampages like this,</em> I told her so inwardly. I don&#8217;t know if it was transmitted to her. <em>It was probably not transmitted, though.</em></p>


<p>“Fumu, then Zeid. I&#8217;ll confirm it again, but aren’t you planning to leave the order and go to the guild?”</p>
<p>“……Ah”</p>


<p>That&#8217;s right. I was told by Riff that she wants me to move from the chivalric order to the Guild.</p>
<p>I was told that I could get a hundred gold coins as contract money or advance payment. The salary of the knight order is ten copper coins after deducting living expenses and other costs, so to be honest, it feels pretty suspicious.</p>
<p>I mean, I still don&#8217;t believe it.</p>


<p>“Ah, the contract money has already been prepared. Here”</p>


<p><em>I wonder if I have such a look of suspiciousness on my face. </em></p>
<p>Riff pulled a squeaking jute bag full of something out of her breast pocket, which must have been shallow, and placed it on the table. I wonder where did she get it from. I’m guessing she invoked some kind of space magic. <em>I&#8217;m not sure because I&#8217;m sleepy.</em></p>
<p>The jute bag was indeed filled with gold coins. Just by looking at it, it was an innumerable number.</p>
<p>A gurgle escaped my throat.</p>
<p>I haven&#8217;t spent much money. I don&#8217;t have the opportunity to use it, and the wages for the work are low in the first place. There are even months when I don’t get paid.</p>
<p>But I do remember the few times I spent money on food. I will never forget the steak full of fat and the soup full of flavor.</p>
<p>Since they could be bought for three copper coins, what could I do with these gold coins?</p>
<p>I can have my own house &#8230;&#8230; hire people to do the chores &#8230;&#8230; and of course, I can eat delicious food &#8230;&#8230;.</p>
<p>My dream &#8230;&#8230; is expanding.</p>


<p>“Hoy! Zeid! You, what is your mission. Say it! It was 『To protect the country with your body and soul』! There’s no way you’re going to fall for her just to the extent that she flashed you some money, right!?”</p>




<p>“No, I&#8217;m leaving the Order and going to the Guild.”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/nmTqsrt/178709.jpg" alt="178709" border="0"></a>

<p>“Hah!?”</p>

<p>Rande&#8217;s face contorts as he glares at me.</p>
<p>Then he opened his mouth and cursed at me.</p>


<p>“Are you still calling yourself a proud member of the Chivalric Order!? You&#8217;re still a man of the First Order! You&#8217;ve been working all this time to protect your country, haven&#8217;t you! But when money was shown to you, you wag your tail!? That&#8217;s a stupid thing to say and do! You deserve contempt!”</p>


<p>He’s just firing off, but to be clear, it doesn&#8217;t matter.</p>
<p>His words are no longer reaching my ears.</p>
<p>Instead, my eyes were glued to the gold coins that are packed tightly.</p>
<p>But there is one problem —— I&#8217;m a prisoner of the Order.</p>


<p>“Nufufu, I guess this means Zeid can leave the Order now, huh?”</p>
<p>“……No, it’s not good! Zeid will continue to work for the Chivalric order! He is a prisoner the Order has captured!”</p>
<p>“Umu? That would be weird. Zeid isn’t a prisoner, he was just being sheltered by the Order, right? It seems that you have convinced him to work as a member of the Order, but unlike in our guild, do you have a rule that binds an individual as well? Chivalric Order?”</p>
<p>“That kind of thing is……!”</p>
<p>“Kukuku. It&#8217;s atrocious for you to try to use him until he’s worn out without even giving him time to identify it. However, with this, Zeid also changed his perception. I think he can be released already. Don&#8217;t you think so, Zeid?”</p>
<p>“Well, if I have no mistake, then I’ll go to the guild without reservation.”</p>


<p><em>In other words, I wasn&#8217;t exactly a prisoner huh.</em></p>
<p>I hadn&#8217;t tried to escape until now because it would have been troublesome if I was chased as a criminal by all the people in the country, but it seemed to have backfired.</p>


<p>“Guh……! I&#8217;m going to beat that rotten spirit out of you, Zeid! I&#8217;m going to change your mind!”</p>


<p>Rande leans forward and tries to grab me.</p>
<p>However, Sheila, who had been watching us quietly until now, stopped him.</p>


<p>“Father! Please don&#8217;t go any further!”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about, Sheila! I&#8217;m going to beat his guts out of him!”</p>
<p>“Father is trying to crush him into pieces, isn&#8217;t he!? He has already said he wants to quit, so you can&#8217;t force him. &#8230;&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“Gununu……! Sheila! The reason I selected you to be my vice commander is to change your values for the future! You still don&#8217;t get it! This country needs a force to be reckoned with! That’s why, such use of force is also…&#8230;!”</p>
<p>“Use of force, is it! Zeid&#8217;s strength is higher than all the members of the Chivalric Order&#8230;&#8230;.!”</p>


<p>Or, it was something like that.</p>
<p>Such words echo throughout the room.</p>
<p>I asked Riff in the midst of all this.</p>



<p>“When can I quit the Order?”</p>
<p>“I can complete the procedure here. You may leave your seat now.”</p>
<p>“……Is that so”</p>


<p>I thought about it for a while.</p>
<p>What if I leave the Order? More or less, I will throw away the bed and food I have been given. <em>I wonder if that really is a good thing.</em></p>
<p><em>It&#8217;s a workplace where I could die at any time, but it still has the identity as a </em><em>『</em><em>workplace</em><em>』</em><em>, so——</em></p>
<p>Well, I got up from my seat in seconds, though.</p>
<p>Because if there was a worse environment than the one I have now, it would be something that goes beyond hell. And, since the chivalric order is hell, there&#8217;s no worse environment than here.</p>
<p><em>If I was told to start over from the time I was five years old at the bottom of the Forbidden Forest, I might choose the Order, though.</em></p>
<p>However, I would rather be grateful for the joy of encountering something I couldn’t have imagined.</p>


<p>——Anyway, I want to live outside the chivalric order to make my life better than it is now.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I walked away from Rande, who was trying to keep me there.</p>
