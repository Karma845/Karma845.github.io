<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p>Hello everyone, I'm Jiou. </p>
<p>Thank you for purchasing this book. </p
<p>There is finally a book out. </p>
<p>I'm grateful for all the help I've received from everyone involved, and I've been sending waves of thanks all the time. I hope I'm not causing you to dream about me. </p> 
<p>This book is in the National Library of Congress.</p> 
<p>I think all published works are given a copy to the state. </p>
<p>As long as this country is still here, even if I am at the end of my life, my words and stories will live on. I feel a lot of emotion when I think about it. </p>
<p>It seems like ...... uses too many inflections. </p>

<p>That's right. </p>
<p>After writing for a long time, I seem to be prone to what I call "occupational disease". (I'm sorry for saying that.) </p>
<p>For example, I'd be very concerned about ending more than two lines in a row with "~oh" or "~ah", or having the same text too often, punctuation just right, etc. </p>
<p>Like this. </p>
<p>Tummy, hungry. </p>
<p>So hungry, to eat. </p>
<p>I feel like I'm on pins and needles when this happens ...... </p>
<p>While I've often had the opportunity to write long essays before, like writing papers and organizing data for reports, I've never paid much attention to the arrangement of the words. </p>
<p>This new discovery is really interesting.</p><p>This is an interesting discovery.
<p>Sorry for the inexplicable stuff in the afterword. Thanks again to those who bought the book. </p>
<p>This book got to readers thanks to everyone involved in helping to produce and sell it, and I can't thank you enough! </p>
