<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; Getting stronger quickly at the Dragon Village! ④ </h3>

<p>「You subjugated an evil dragon as a 14-year old villager…… and you are saying that it is natural to do so」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Kuhaha, </em>the Dragon King laughed holding his stomach.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Maybe that’s why I’m interested in you」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And, I continued.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Subjugating an evil dragon at 14 years old? That’s just natural. If I’m not at least capable of that…… that person would be troubled」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Kuha…… Kuhaha…… I see. You saying that you are a mere Hero’s…… guardian?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Ah yes, that’s why just quickly hand over the Protection of the Dragon King」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Fumu</em>, and the Dragon King grabbed my head with his hand.</p>
<p>If he had put a bit strength in it, my skull would surely rupture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Towards a Dragon King…… you demanded the protection? Aren’t you a bit too carried away? You…… mere human」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I kept silence for a while.</p>
<p>And I directed my gaze fearlessly towards the Dragon King.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「The most efficient way is from the Dragon tribe. However…… the Majin tribe…… or at worst the Devils, I would also sell my soul to them…… I have that choice」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dragon King showed a shocked expression.</p>
<p>「Toward the Devils…… was it? But if you chose that method…… You would probably not be allowed to reincarnate,<i> </i>and continuously suffer the hardships in hell…… (tl: the concept of <i>Saṃsāra</i>)」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Of course, if possible, I would like to say no thank you to that. That’s why I’m here bowing my head down to you」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Kukuku</em>, the Dragon King once again laughed gleefully.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Are you saying that you are showing respect with that unrestrained way of speech?」</p>
<p>「But……. You do…… like these kinds of atmospheres right?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Yes</em>, he nodded his head and smiled.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Yes, I like it…… I really like people like you」<br />
(tl: just fyi the raws are「ああ、お好きだねえ……君みたいなのは大好物だ」; it just sounded too wrong)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I offered my right hand toward the Dragon King.</p>
<p>The Dragon King too reached out his hand with a face full of smiles.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>When both of us shook hands– something hot flowed into my heart.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「This is…… the Protection of the Dragon King?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Yes, yes it is?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「It means that……?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Yes, that’s right– the growth correction for your level up……your minus factors are largely eliminated as an Occupational Aptitude: villager」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「That is……. I finally could…… level up without any worries? Or I can hunt monsters without rejecting experience points from monsters?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Deliberately…… Do you need my explanation?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「As a precaution…… please do」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>The Dragon King took a while to think and started explaining.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「You do know about the concept of experience points and level right?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「To use another’s life energy– using those to enhance oneself’s physical power and mana…… right?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Yes</em>, the Dragon King nodded his head and said.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Before that, what is…… an Occupational Aptitude?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「In short, it is a blessing from the goddess」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「It’s as you’ve said…… then……concretely what is it?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「The rate of your growth will be…… all of them, different. Take for an example…… when a Hero levels up, their attack power will increase by 20 while…… 3 for a villager…… in that sense.」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In actuality, the difference in number is not correct, well, the idea of it is not wrong.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「And there is the appearance of the Protection of the Dragon King. Your growth rate as a villager…… will be corrected to a dragoon…… Even though it cannot be compared to the Hero’s, it is a growth rate more similar to that of a high level occupation like Sage or a Holy Knight」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Yes</em>, I nodded my head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「That is why I got through hardships all while staying at Level 1…… Besides training MP, all I did was fundamental muscle training and polishing up skills」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Of course that would be the case」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And the Dragon King looked down at his watch.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Such an expensive watch?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「It’s not the full clothing of the place called Kabukichō?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A watch from Omega……</p>
<p>It shockingly doesn’t suit the background of a fantasy world, making me laugh bitterly.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「It’s almost time. Anything else?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Aaa, my problems currently are only those」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Then, what will you do after this?」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「Hmm……」</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I continued after giving a smile.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>「For now…… it’s about time I worked hard to level up」</p>
