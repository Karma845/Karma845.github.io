<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; Magic Stone Exchange</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">After
that, we all had dinner together and called it a night.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
is only one tent, and we were offered to use it as we are their guests and also
a token of thanks for our help earlier, but we didn't want to monopolize the
tent, so we took turns doing the night watch.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">First,
Nemumu and I would use the tent, Erio and Miya would sleep outdoors. Gimra and
Wardy would be in charge of the first night shift.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
and Miya will switch turns with Gimra and Wardy on the 2nd shift.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Lastly,
Nemumu and I will switch turns with Erio and Miya.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
declared, "I don't need to sleep for a couple of days. I'll be up all
night tonight."</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Three
of us, including him, would take charge of the night watch.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal"><span class="calibre12">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre11">　</span><span class="calibre12">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre11">　</span><span class="calibre11">☆</span><span class="calibre17"></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
night shift ended without any problems, and morning arrived.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
don't want to trouble them too much, so we leave before breakfast.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Erio
and the others will stay in the dungeon for a couple of days to hunt goblins.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"If
there is an opportunity, let's fight in the dungeon together again. It would be
great if Gold-san could teach me how to use the sword and shield."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Erio]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Sure,
we'll be glad to fight together with you again."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
shook hands with Erio, made a promise to him, and we set off for the entrance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
increased our distance from Erio and the others, made sure there was no one
around, and started moving again with SSR, Presence Concealment, and SR,
Flight.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
arrived at the dungeon entrance in less than an hour.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
this early morning, more adventurers are entering than leaving the dungeon.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Thanks
to this, we were able to get out quickly.</span></p>



<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"My
Lord, what do we do now?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Are
we going back to the inn? [Nemumu]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Before
we go back to the inn, we'll go to the Adventurer's Guild and exchange the
magic stone for cash. I don't want to carry it around any longer." [Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
went to the guild against the flow of adventurers heading for the dungeon.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
show up at the guild just a day after I made my adventurer tag.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
is a board on the wall with request posters on it. </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">"Request:
10 bundles of medicinal herbs growing on the riverside of the 1st floor of the
dungeon."</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">"Request
to collect crystal from the volcano on the 5th floor." </span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
are requests not only for dungeons but also for the inside and outside of the
city.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">There
are many different kinds of requests.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Despite
it's just early morning, there are a surprisingly large number of adventurers.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Everyone
wakes up early to get the more rewarding quest jobs posted on the bulletin
board.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Some
adventurers ignore the quests and explore the dungeons, but they have their own
reason.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
head to the receptionist's counter across the bulletin board.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
receptionists of the adventurer's guild are standing at each counter, separated
by a partition.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
receptionists are Dwarf women. Perhaps it's because the guild is located in the
Dwarf Kingdom.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I go
to one of them.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Good
morning. Are you here for a quest?"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Receptionist]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No,
I just came back from the dungeon this morning, so I need you to exchange magic
stones."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
Dwarf race is short in stature, but they do not seem weak because of their
muscular physiques, both male and female.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
they are children, their physique looks normal, but as they get older, they
become more muscular.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
receptionist in charge of us was also a little taller than me but had a solid
body.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
handed her a bag full of magic stones from the first, second, and third levels.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
took it and checked the contents.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Immediately,
her eyebrows furrowed.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
colors indicate that these are magic stones from the three levels, but you guys
just enter the dungeon the day before yesterday, right? I remember seeing you
come here to register as adventurers."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I've
been exploring the dungeon since yesterday early morning, is there a problem?"</span>
<span class="calibre13">[Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I've
been collecting magic stones, mostly from trolls on the third level, to raise
my adventurer rank.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">During
the Race Union days, I had heard that some dungeons prohibit excessive
overhunting to maintain the purchase price of magic stones.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Could
it be that this dungeon had such a restriction, and we accidentally hunted too
many?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
receptionist looks at me as if I'm a thief.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It
is impossible for a human to go through two or three levels of a dungeon in one
day and get this many magic stones. The guild does not exchange magic stones
obtained through criminal or illegal activities for cash. Therefore, we cannot
buy these magic stones from you!"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Receptionist]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
couldn't help but frown behind my mask.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She basically
said, "it is impossible for the human race that is generally inferior to
other races to collect this many magic stones in a single day. You must be
doing something criminal."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
thought that if I brought in a large number of magic stones from the three
levels, I could raise my rank quickly......</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
never thought that I would be suspected of criminal or illegal activities.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">The
racial prejudice against human race is really deep-rooted.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">&nbsp;</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">I
sensed that Nemumu was about to yell in anger, so I raised one hand to stop
her.</span></span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span><span class="calibre13">While
holding my anger at the irrational accusations, I opened my mouth.</span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
swear that we didn't do any crime or illegal activity. All we did is enter the
dungeon, defeat the monsters, collect the magic stones, and return. Also, what
kind of crime or illegal activities do you think we used to get these magic
stones?"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Well,
something like... robbing another adventurer in the dungeon..."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Receptionist]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Please
stop <span>accusing people</span> without evidence. We never
attacked other adventurers. We're going to continue supply magic rocks like
this to prove our abilities." [Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">“…………You
will continue supplying us? Tsk... Indeed, accusing without evidence is bad. Since
no problem has been found in the rules, we will buy your magic stone this time.
But don't forget that the guild will not overlook any crimes or illegal
activities."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Receptionist]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
was difficult to refuse to buy it because there is no evidence, and the
receptionist backed down in frustration.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Although
she seem to imply, but then she said, "We'll let it go now because we
don't have any evidence, but if you show your tail, we'll crush you
thoroughly".</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
respond to her words politely.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Of
course. I'd like to be an honest adventurer so as not to cause any trouble for
the guild." [Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Maybe
she took my answer as sarcasm, since the receptionist handed the money for the
magic stones to us rudely.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre8">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre8">☆</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre6">☆</span><span class="calibre13"></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"How
dare she speak so rudely to Dark-sama......? If you give me an order, I'll
erase her from this world without leaving any trace."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Nemumu]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
glad you're angry for me, Nemumu, but please refrain from making dangerous
comments like that. If the receptionist disappears, we will be the first ones
to be suspected. That's why I want you to forget about it." [Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I,
I'm sorry! I didn't think that far ahead! I didn't mean to cause any trouble
for you, Dark-sama......"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Nemumu]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
okay, I understand. But you should be a little more careful about what you say
and do." [Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"My
Lord......"</span> <span class="calibre13">[Gold]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">As
we leave the Adventurer's Guild, I warn Nemumu to be careful about her words
and actions. Suddenly, Gold whispered.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
know. Nemumu, how many?" [Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Three.
It seems that there are two more who are moving quickly to block our way."</span>
<span class="calibre13">[Nemumu]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"UR,
Level 5000 Assassin Blade Nemumu". She knew exactly how many people are
following us, and even the number of people ahead of us."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I
want to see what kind of person we are dealing with. They might have some
useful information. I'd like to make contact with them in a quiet place.
Nemumu, can you lead us?" [Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"No
problem. Please do not proceed to the inn, but turn left to the small
path."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Nemumu]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">We
left the Adventurer's Guild and headed straight back to the inn, but on the
way, I followed Nemumu's instructions to take a path that led to a small back
street.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
could sense that our followers hurriedly following us.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Dark-sama,
one person has moved from the back to join the two who were in front of us. Please
slow down a bit."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Nemumu]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Roger
that. And Gold, I count on you."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Dark]</span></p>


<p class="msonormal3"><span class="calibre13">"Of
course, my Lord."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Gold]<span>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span></span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
followed Nemumu's instructions to slow down my walking speed.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">She
also leads them to an unpopulated area, where they can easily block our way.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Our
followers move as if they are being controlled by Nemumu.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
appear in front of and behind us at places and times that are convenient for
us.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Wait
a minute, human. Let's have a chat with us."</span> <span class="calibre13">[Bear]</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">A
voice called out from behind.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
we turned around, we saw a bear beastman, over two meters tall, standing there
with one of his men. He has a smirking smile on his face.</span></p></div>
