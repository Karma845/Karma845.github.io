<h2>Interlude</h2>

<p>At the temple of darkness.</p>
<p>However, the one being worship there wasn’t God, but the Demon King.</p>
<p>Abode of Demons(Fukumaden)—— the home of the Dark Magic Association Prospero.</p>
<p>Seven people, are prostrating in that place.</p>
<p>Living in the darkness, sacrificing themselves for the darkness, reformer and destroyer —— and, slaughterer.</p>
<p>In the back of the Fukumaden, a purple flame is burning like it’s the principal object of their worship.</p>
<p>The man standing in front of the flame, says.</p>

<p>“Weak man, thou name is —— human being”</p>

<p>The voice is beautiful, and it’s somehow melancholy.</p>

<p>&#8220;Can you hear, the griefs of man. The mourning actor on this foolish stage which is the world.”</p>
<p>“——Fartus”</p>

<p>The seven people respond solemnly. It&#8217;s Prospero&#8217;s prayer. A word that means 『Fate』. <em>(TN: From the Latin word Fatum)</em></p>
<p>The man who was standing up in the purple flame, was a beautiful boy.</p>
<p>He looks like he’s in his mid-teens. He has white hair that extends to his shoulders and purple eyes.</p>
<p>His slightly melancholic mouth opens.</p>

<p>&#8220;I ask you. Should he live, or die?&#8221;</p>
<p>“——At the will of our Prophet, Master Lawrence.&#8221;</p>

<p>The seven people responded.</p>

<p>“Then, let’s hear him. Our comrade and brother, Sazaku.&#8221;</p>
<p>“……Ha”</p>

<p>One of the seven people who were prostrating —— Sazaku raises his masked face.</p>

<p>“Let me humbly say, Master Lawrence. This Sazaku, have gotten a clue about the 『Demon King’s Half Body (Juliet) 』.&#8221;</p>

<p>In his single line, the complexion of the other six people changed. One of them speaks in a threatening voice.</p>

<p>“Sazaku. If you’re playing a prank, I won&#8217;t forgive you.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;Master Lawrence, the 『Demon King’s Half Body (Juliet) 』, whose whereabouts are still unknown, you also want to know it, right?”</p>

<p>An atmosphere that resembled bloodlust swirled.</p>

<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not an official report yet. It’s still in the investigation stage …… However, the obstacles are bigger than I thought, so my power right now doesn’t match for it. By all means——&#8221;</p>

<p>The eyes of the mask glistened.</p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>&#8220;Give me more power of the Demon King! The Sacred Demon King’s Flame!!&#8221;</p>

<p>Of the six, one speaks in a low voice.</p>

<p>&#8220;That is not needed. Leave it to me. Brother Sazaku.&#8221;</p>
<p>&#8220;No, this is still an uncertain story. If you can&#8217;t find a single mouse*, it will be an embarrassment for you, Brother Vauxhall&#8221; <em>(TN: something like a play thing)</em></p>

<p>Bloodlust crosses between the two.</p>
<p>Filled with magic power, magic formulas are assembled between the two people.</p>

<p>“——Good job. Sazaku”</p>

<p>Lawrence&#8217;s words, eliminate the bloodlust of the two.</p>

<p>“That was close”</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>When Sazaku stood up, he bowed his head and stepped forward, as if he was scared.</p>
<p>Lawrence opens his clasped hand.</p>
<p>In the palm of his hand, a purple flame was burning.</p>
<p>It’s beautiful, but ominous —— a shimmer that can snatch away one’s heart.</p>
<p>Lawrence pressed his hand which was holding that against Sazaku&#8217;s chest.</p>
<p>The purple flame disappears, as if it was sucked into Sazaku&#8217;s body.</p>
<p>The next moment,</p>

<p>“Uooaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaahhh!!”</p>

<p>A scream of delight and despair burst out of Sazaku&#8217;s throat. His eyes are wide open under his mask, and blood vessels throughout his body emerge.</p>
<p>Lawrence stared expressionlessly at the scene, and took his hand off Sazaku.</p>

<p>&#8220;Bring back good news&#8221;</p>

<p>Sazaku was feeling full of power throughout his body.</p>
<p>The magic power he feels inside his body is also different.</p>
<p>It was a pleasure, as if he had been reborn as a higher-grade being.</p>

<p>“……I respectfully obey”</p>

<p>Sazaku puts his hand on his chest. The purple flame shimmered there.</p>

<p>“This —— with the flames of the 『Demon King’s Soul(Romesai)』 .”</p>
