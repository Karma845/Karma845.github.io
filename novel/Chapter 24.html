<h3>Chapter 24 &#8211; Hunting the Adventurer Killer ④</h3>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">&nbsp;It
seems that the elf who is shouting in front of me is an existence called
"Sub-Master" who has the "Master" blood.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Initially,
I had planned to kill him to raise our adventurer rank, but circumstances have
changed.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I'm
still going to kill him, but we're not going to hand over his body to the
Adventurer's Guild. I'll take him back to Naraku because I need to get
information about Master and Sub-Master.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">For
the first time, I take an attack position to neutralize him.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Fuh!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
exhaling lightly, I kicked the ground lightly!</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I am
not as strong as the vanguard, but I have trained in close combat for several
years under Mei's guidance.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Even
though he was already on guard with his sword, I once again managed to hit
Kaito's abdomen with my staff due to the level difference between us.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Gugooo!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
vomited again and knelt on the ground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Taking
advantage of this opportunity, I kicked him straight away.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Because
his attention was focused on the pain in his stomach, when I kick him,
"Grandius" slipped from his hand, and he rolls on the ground.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nemumu,
pick up that sword."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Roger,
Dark-sama"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">While
giving instruction, I walk over to Kaito that rolled on the ground.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">From
the corner of my eye, I see Nemumu take out a handkerchief to pick up Grandius.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Apparently,
she didn't want to hold it directly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
didn't leave it to Gold is because he acts as a guard, and I want to keep him
light so he can move quickly. Maybe it would be better if he's the one who
picks up Grandius?</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
press my foot on Kaito's neck as I'm thinking about that.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Gugee!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"It's
better not to move. If you move, I can easily break your neck."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">It
would be troublesome if he resists, so I threaten him.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Perhaps
my threat is effective because Kaito panting in pain and tries not to move his
body as much as possible. He just stares at me from below.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Without
paying attention to his stare, I take out the "SSR, Transfer" card
from my pocket.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Transfer,
release, to Naraku."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">With
my words, the four of us were surrounded by light and disappeared from that
dungeon instantly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
next moment we appeared in the training ground in the Naraku basement.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
original dungeon terrain and rocky floors are still there.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito,
whose neck I am pressing with my feet, leak out a shocked voice.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Where
the hell is this place?</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Just a moment ago, we were in a
grassland dungeon!</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"We've
moved to the basement of Naraku, where I live. Look, do you know this place?
The world's largest, hardest and most punitive dungeon."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Naraku,
the world's largest, hardest and most punitive dungeon. You mean Naraku, which
located deep in the forests of Dragon Newt Empire territory? Impossible! Did we
move from the Dwarf dungeon to Naraku in an instant!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Kaito
was surprised by the environment that changed from grasslands to rugged rocks.
He turned his gaze towards us.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Are,
are you the ones who gave the transfer magic item to that human girl...!?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Transfer
magic item... Well, that is a magic item."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
don't need to teach him, so I'm not going to explain.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
thought he would suffer for letting Miya run away, but my reaction is
different.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"What
the hell were you thinking, handing over a transfer item that allows you to
move instantly to a novice adventurer like her? Do you have any idea how
expensive a transfer magic item is?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"...yeah,
I've heard that it worth a lot of money."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">When
I was at the Races Union, other adventurers were complaining to each other that
they wished they have a transfer magic item.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Magic
items that allow the user to instantly travels to a different location are rare
and not even sold at regular auctions.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">They
are generally kept by noblemen and top-level adventurers to ensure their safety
in case of emergency. They are too expensive for the ordinary adventurer to
afford.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
one I gave to Miya is the SSR Praying Misanga, which is not a transfer magic
item. It came out of the Infinity Gacha. That's why it's an expensive item on
the surface world.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">However,
I have no intention of selling the Infinite Gacha cards on the surface world
for money.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
can get a lot of money by selling the metal lumps from the "Infinite
Gacha" cards. I won't sell Infinite Gacha cards because there's a chance
it may be used against me by the enemy.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"My
Lord, it looks like he is not a guest, but should I prepare some tea?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei
appears. She sways her ponytail hair while telling a joke.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Meow!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Welcome
back, God Raito! Looks like you bring home a weird creature with you.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"My
Lord, welcome back!</span><span lang="JA" class="calibre6">　</span><span class="calibre13">Are you going to stay in Naraku tonight?
If so, let's sleep together tonight!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">The
others who noticed my appearance in Naraku showed up one after another.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">This
place is Naraku training ground, but since this place is mainly used for
training, only a few people can come here.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Aoyuki
mimics a cat's meow like usual, and Elly directs her cold gaze at my feet.
Nazuna also speaks to me casually.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
couldn't help but smile because our conversation is the same as usual.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I'm
back, everyone. No need to make tea. He's the criminal who attacked Miya-chan,
her brother Erio and her friends, and the other humans. It seems that he knows
some information about the Master, so we just brought him here to interrogate
him before we kill him."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Hiii!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">At
my words, the four of them turn their eyes to Kaito.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">He
lets out a small scream and trembles as they look at him with murderous intent.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"The
criminal who attacked the humans......, in other words, he is an insolent thing
who interfered with my Lord. If you give me the order, I will squeeze out the
information then dispose him. Of course, I'll also make him suffer and regret
being born into this world. I promise you in the name of my maid way." </span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Mei's
words just now sounded terrifying.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"God
Raito doesn't need to dirty your hand. Please leave the interrogation and the
punishment to me, Elly. I will make this trash taste every taboo torture I know
from head to toe." </span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Elly
assured me with a beautiful smile that is colder than ice.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Sin
against my Lord. You will pay for it with extreme pain and life."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Aoyuki
angrily glared at Kaito.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Aan?
This guy interfered with his Master? I'm going to crush him!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Nazuna
is angry, and she walks up to me to finish him off directly.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I'm
glad she's angry for me, but I don't want her to kill him now. Because I
haven't extracted any single piece of information out of him yet.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
raise my hand lightly and give instruction.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Nazuna,
as I said before, he seems to know some information about the Master, so we'll
only kill him after we get all the information out of him. Everyone, don't
touch him. Okay?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Roger
that, my Lord."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Meow."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"As
you wish, God Raito."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"If
my Lord says don't touch him, then I won't touch him. Because that's my Lord's
order!"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">Gold
and Nemumu had already understood what we need to do, so there would be no
problem.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">With
this, the preparations for extracting the information are done.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
look down at Kaito, who is still trembling under Mei and the others'
intimidation.</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"Now,
can you answer our question?"</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">"I,
I'll talk! I'll talk to you, please spare me! I, I was a member of the White
Knights of the Elf Queen country and a candidate for the next leader. I know a
lot of information! </span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I
also know the castle layout, guard stations, and other important facilities! I
also have other useful information! I'll give you my "Grandius" as
well. So, I beg you.<span>&nbsp; </span>Please,
please."</span></p>


<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">“…………”</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">In
the dwarves dungeon, he one-sidedly looked down on us and despised us as
humans. Still, after we moved to Naraku basement, his attitude changed
completely.</span></p>

<p class="msonormal1"><span class="calibre13">I am
annoyed by the drastic change in his attitude.</span></p></div>
