<h3>Chapter 6</h3>

<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;My own adventure begins.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I'm going to challenge the unknown with a lot of friends.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille Thardonyx gazed up at the ceiling of her bunk, feeling childish before a field trip.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Born as a Dwarf princess, her dream is to become a dungeon adventurer.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But even though there is no security in her life or future, she dreams of becoming a dungeon adventurer more than any other occupation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is the perfect escape for those who want to be "something special".</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reality is that many adventurers just call themselves adventurers, but they don't even attempt to challenge dungeons. They waste their days idly, and when people ask them about it, they just call themselves adventurers for the sake of not having a regular job.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But Lucille is unaware of this reality.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The dungeon adventurers Lucille knows are limited to brave heroes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if they are of a different race, if they are born into royalty, their lives are luxurious and opulent.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, she was dissatisfied.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She has no freedom.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The major goals of her life, and how she should live her life, have been decided.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if there is local freedom, such as what clothes to wear or what food to eat, in the long run, it is a life bound by obligations with no freedom.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The lack of freedom is a privilege that is granted, but Lucille, the person involved, is not convinced.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Currently, Dwarves have no prince.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille's brother, who would have been king, was killed in a war with the elves 200 years ago.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The only child of the current King is Lucille, a princess, but no woman has ever been elected as a King in the history of the kingdom.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Therefore, her life was tantamount to being kept alive only to have a husband and bear children.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The unlimited future that should have been given to her when her brother was alive was snatched away from her at an early age, and she was reduced to a tool with the role of princess.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The healing of these days is the tale of adventures of adventurers.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Books are an important entertainment item in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, since there is no printing technology and handwritten manuscripts are the standard, the unit price of even a novel usually exceeds 100,000 Japanese yen in the previous world. Incidentally, the most expensive books are those with pictures, which are difficult to copy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Books are so expensive that some rich people from commoner backgrounds boast about buying books even if they cannot actually read and write.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In this world, having books was a status.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Because of this financial situation, there are very few people who can read and write even if they can speak the language.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the farming village where Mars grew up, there was even no one who could write besides Mars and the village chief, who taught himself grammar from the law.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As royalty, Lucille had a pile of books, a luxury item.<br /></p>

<p class="calibre">&#12288;The pleasure of being the first to make one's own footprints on a horizon that no one had ever seen before was well known in the snowy landscape.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is an indescribable sense of conquest and superiority. The highest level of this is conquering a dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Of course, the reality is that there are many fictions mixed in with adventure stories &#8213; or rather, most of them &#8213; but Lucille believes that it really happened.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Whether it is a dragon perched atop a mountain of gems and feeding on them, or a giant fish swimming like water through lava, in Lucille's mind, they are real creatures.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The image of adventurers who grasp glory through their own resourcefulness and hard work alone has greatly influenced her choice of lifestyle.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is the fate of all emotional creatures to beg for what they do not have.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If Lucille had been born a commoner, she would have aspired to royalty or nobility.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Because she happened to be born into royalty, she only admired dungeon adventurers who lived freely, the opposite of herself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is a fact that not many people can be satisfied with the vessels they are born with.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille is over 200 years old, but her time interval is different from that of a human being.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The sense is that a human day is only about three hours long, and because of the long time spent in labor and other actions essential to life, the time to build up to something important in life, including thinking, is relatively short compared to human society.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Therefore, even though she is over 200 years old, her mentality is not much different from that of ordinary girls.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I will definitely marry him. I'm going to be an adventurer in the Seven Great Dungeons, and I'm going on adventures with him. &#8213;&#8213;I will have a true companion and friend.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Until now, Dwarves have not been willing to conquer dungeons honestly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;First of all, no one thought it was possible to conquer &#12302;De Stogechel's Demon Mine&#12303; in the usual way.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When the former royalty went to the deepest layer and came back, it was only because of the accumulation of miracles beyond their abilities, and if asked if they could conquer it again, they would answer that it would be difficult. In fact, that was true, as long as they were not out to conquer it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, the world is changing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Two of the Seven Great Dungeons that had been impregnable until then have now been conquered.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Heroes who had been hiding in the wild are coming out one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That is why it was decided that the whole country would attack a large scale, as it did this time.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille offered her father, the king, that she would join him in taking on the Seven Great Dungeons when the conquerors of the dungeons appeared, and he agreed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille is unaware of the plotting of the Dwarves as a nation and that the King's true love is Onyx Lordlight.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille is also part of the king's plot.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Mars Irving. If I go with you, I can be the hero I've always dreamed of being.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I can be the one who spins the tale of adventure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille looked at the equipment she had prepared for this day on the wall and clenched her fists in her bedclothes.</p>
