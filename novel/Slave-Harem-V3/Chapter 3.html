<h3>Chapter 3</h3>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;Do you hear that <span style="font-style: italic;">gacha-gacha</span>, <span style="font-style: italic;">gyuuuin</span> sound? What is that moving iron-like thing ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That&nbsp;<span style="font-style: italic;">gigigi</span>&nbsp;sound it's a noisy-nya&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It sounds as if the metal is rubbing against the metal.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia and Nemu, who have good ears, immediately covered their ears with their hands.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;And it's so dark in this town! It's as dark as I was in the village!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is that something you can laugh at-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If that makes you laugh with all your might, and I'll grin along with it, but also get a little hurt! The one that makes you want to cry before you go to bed! It's the one that reminds you of how much you're lonely!&#12301;(?)</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then don't say it......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After climbing up the seemingly eternally long mountain road, the scenery changed when the mountainside came into view.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In a slightly hollowed-out terrain was a large town.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was bizarrely snowless and dimly lit.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It should have been a place where snow blows all year round, but there was hardly even a trace of it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;And there were fires placed all over the place, as if in a cave.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Perhaps because of this, the temperature rose rapidly, and it was a little hot in winter clothes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The safest route to &#12302;De Stogechel Demon Mine&#12303;, one of the Seven Great Dungeons, seems to be through this town. It is said to be internally connected to the top of the mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Otherwise, you have to climb a precipitous cliff to reach the dungeon, which is impossible for both Lilia and Hazuki, not to mention Mars and Nemu.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It seems that it is just like climbing a vertical ice wall. You'll die before you enter the dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is there a ceiling ...... in the sky?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Is it glass, or was there snow on the ceiling, making it look like a snow cone.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The snow is blocking the sunlight, so the whole city is dark as night.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In this world, poorly made cloudy glass exists, but nothing so huge that it can cover an entire city.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is impossible, even in the modern world, to cover a city with a single sheet of glass that does not even have support.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;This is one of the strange and bizarre inventions of the Dwarves. An invisible roof made of magic covers the entire city &#8213; or rather, the entire country &#8213; and isolates it from the outside environment. They can't just gouge out a mountain to get their favorite ore, and then change the environment itself to make themselves look like they own it, can they?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's what humans do too, so I can't say anything about it. ...... In short, you're saying there's some kind of warding magic going on permanently.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes. It's supposed to prevent demonic invasions and the like. It's like a national fortress. It's the technology, this fortification, and even the topography that makes it independent.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The interior can be seen clearly from the entrance to the city, which is covered by an invisible dome.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was a sled station near the entrance, allowing for an easy descent.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Inside, the scene was familiar to Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was the very sound that Hazuki and the others were describing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Is this an industrial area?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Dwarves have always been a race that uses facilities like that, and the whole family works together to make something. There's nothing tasteful about it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;While Lilia was expressing her bitterness with all her might, Mars, on the other hand, was thrilled by the steampunk environment.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;The beginning of a mechanical civilization.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;At this rate, we're not even far from a locomotive!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although the level of civilization is at best pre-modern, the direction of technological development does not seem to change regardless of the world as long as it follows rationality, and many innovations seem to have been devised to improve work efficiency.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Steam was rising here and there in the city, and the driving sound of machines was screeching in a steady rhythm.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The sounds were layered together to create a single result.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What Mars and the others saw was a trolley. Many connected trolleys were running on a single rail, pouring ore at regular intervals into a huge blast furnace in the center of the city.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The scene resembled a roller coaster.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The slight difference is that the trolleys themselves also fall into the furnace.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;From the blast furnace, some of the molten metal is poured into a mold, and apparently, it is formed into the shape of the trolley again.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I guess they don't have the technology to switch tracks.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's not magic ......, is it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Isn't there a living thing like that-nya? There are long bugs like that under big stones sometimes-nya. If they bite you-nya,...... it hurts a lot-nya&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's a centipede, isn't it? I don't think it's a monster, and I don't think it's a creature to begin with!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then what is it-nya? It's making a <span style="font-style: italic;">creak-creak</span> sound-nya...?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;H-Hmmm ...... I don't know but it's disgusting ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki and Nemu were more scared than amused by the systematic movements they were seeing for the first time in their lives.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even now, common people's homes are lit by candles and other fires.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Magical machines powered by magical steel are expensive and out of reach of the average person in the countryside.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Industrial products, moreover, are made by the talent and skill of individual craftsmen, and generally, there are no factories or other facilities where anyone can make the same products.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In a sense, therefore, the industry is more mysterious than magic.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This is especially true for Hazuki, who was born and raised in a near-isolated environment, and Nemu, who used to sleep in a stable.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It looks like this is the entrance to the country or a barrier, but I don't see any guards, even though the country is closed off from the rest of the world.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;......? I got the sense from the abundance of goods in the trading city below that something is changing. It's as if they are actively involved with humans,...... and to be honest, even among the different races, Elves are quite exclusive. But Dwarves are also supposed to be just as exclusive. It would be more correct to say that they look down on other races such as humans.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lilia is......Or rather, I ask you as an elf, when do you think about getting involved with humans?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;When a problem arises that cannot be solved by one clan alone &#8213;That is to say, something is happening in this country?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I think so. Because you see, there is a sign that says, &#12302;Adventurers are welcome here. Regardless of your race &#12303;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was only a sign calling for adventurers at the deserted barrier.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;An arrow pointed in the direction of a huge blast furnace in the center of the city.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Centered around the furnace were various buildings that could be either huge factories or castles.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It seemed that this city, this country, was operating around this furnace.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What seemed to be a ward was also deployed from the furnace.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;All goods gathered at the furnace and were sent to all places from the furnace.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was the very heart of the country.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyaaa...That small one with the beard and mustache might not be a child-nya....?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The race of Dwarves is small in stature. That's an adult. However, their arms and legs are extremely thick, so their physical strength is overwhelming among their human relatives.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There are all kinds of people in the world. right. ...... I am a little relieved that their legs are thicker than mine!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;They are thick because of their muscles, though? Pervert women are ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;My legs are ......maybe half of it is meat? &#8213;&#8213;I'm not that fat, am I?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;............&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-Is there any talk that Lilia-san is too thin!? On the contrary!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Around the blast furnace, there were Dwarfs - Dwarves - moving busily.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They were as short as children, shorter on average than Nemu, the smallest of Mars and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The Dwarves also look at Mars and the others quizzically, but they do not pay much attention to them, perhaps because there are other adventurers here, and they return to their work with only a glance.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They did not miss the contempt in their gazes, but also a kind of pity.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Wary that this place is an avenue, Mars heads for the blast furnace, checking the position of the sword at his waist with his hand.</p>
<div class="start-9em">
<p class="calibre">&#9671;</p>
</div>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;In the meantime, your clothes are still intact. If they find out you're an elf or a beastman, you could get in trouble.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes. Nemu and I are both very aware of that.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Even though in this country, there aren't many humans-nyaa?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's no use blurting it out.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu, not liking the fact that her ears, which are sensitive sensory organs, are covered by her hat, squints her eyes and pouts in frustration.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As they came up to the blast furnace, they found themselves in a place where various adventurers were hanging out.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The hall is the closest description, about the size of a high school gymnasium.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was laid out like a tavern, with desks and chairs, and some of them were really drinking.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The items in the hall were all standard human-sized items, while most of the other places he has seen so far were child-sized to match the size of Dwarves.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The room was filled with not only humans but also Dwarven adventurers, giving the place a somewhat chaotic atmosphere.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At the back of the hall was a small counter where a dwarf wearing a helmet with two horns was working as a receptionist.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;On his back was a large pickaxe, not much taller than he was, and although he was supposed to be doing administrative work, he was dressed like a rugged miner himself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The beard covering his face makes it difficult to tell how old he is, but the lack of wrinkles around his eyes leads Mars to assume that he is a young Dwarf.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;His tone was flat and he did not seem very motivated.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Could you please submit a list of the number of dungeons you have conquered, party members, etc.? Any language is fine. If you can't write, I can write for you.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;R-right, ...... Should I also write the names of the dungeons?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There are quite a few people who can write, so this dwarf is probably here to write for you.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars will write in the common language. This is because that is the only language Mars knows.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Most of the different races use the simplest language called the common language, and the majority of humans also use that common language.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Incidentally, Lilia is the only one among them who can understand more than one language, not to mention Elvish.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If possible.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Errr, ...... just to confirm, this is necessary to enter the &#12302;De Stogechel Demon Mine&#12303;, right?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's right.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The anxious-looking Dwarf, with his cheek in his hand, dismisses Mars in an appropriate manner.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars, somewhat bewildered, responded to him.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;It is different from previous dungeons.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;It's kind of ...... bureaucratic. The Great Norn Tomb was the same, so I knew it was going to require permission,.......</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Slightly alarmed by the discomfort, Mars writes a simple profile of himself and the number of party members on a crude, scruffy piece of paper.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Since his intentions were not finalized, he only wrote the names for Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Are they gathering adventurers and surveying their competence by having them write down their achievements?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What do you do, Master? Do you want to write the truth?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hmmm......... I'm a little confused, but I think I should write it down well. Apparently, this is a screening process. I wonder if those with no track record will be put off getting in? Like the guys back there.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The rough-looking adventurers around them were glancing at Mars and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They were ordinary adventurers wearing ordinary swords, common leather armor, chainmail, and other equipment that would cost a fortune.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Some glared at them, and many had an intimidating demeanor.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars's appearance was a bit childish, which was probably more so than the others. Moreover, the party was made up entirely of women and children.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What the adventurers had in common was that their eyes were on them as if to evaluate them, to see where they stood in comparison to the rest of the party.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, in addition to those serious adventurers in a sense, there are also those who just look at Lilia, Hazuki, and Nemu with a vulgar gaze.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Some of them were laughing vulgarly and gesturing with their hips.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Looking away from them for a moment, Hazuki speaks in a whisper so that those around her cannot hear her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;They're all a little disgusting. ...... They're staring at us. ...... No woman would go out with that kind of guy. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I guess they get that idea as soon as they see a woman. It's a male version of a pervert woman. And since we are slaves from the outside, we are even more insulted&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I don't care about anyone, though!? I just wanted to be loved like Lilia-san was when I was with Mars-san!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is that so? I thought you were just a slut. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;T-That's one thing, but! &#8213;&#8213;Your phrasing!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Sticking to Lilia's back, Hazuki was able to escape the gazes of the men.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who is basically shy, had a habit of instantly losing her presence in such a crowded place.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu, on the other hand, grabbed Lilia's sleeve and looked like she had no place to be.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia, who was clinging to both of them, had a disgusted look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu had never been exposed to the eyes of many people while not a slave, so she did not know how to behave in such a situation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Therefore&#8213;&#8213;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu is also being watched-nya. Are they the enemy-nya? It would be easier to defeat them, wouldn't it-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I don't think they are enemies, but...... there are three beautiful girls here, so we are being watched!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Y-you are suddenly overconfident. ...... I still don't understand how this pervert woman's emotions work&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars handed the paper he had finished writing to the receptionist and went to the three who were waiting for a little behind him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;On the paper, he also wrote down the results of the attack &#8213; the Seven Great Dungeons of the &#12302;Great Norn Tomb&#12303;.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;What Mars wants is the &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305; that extends his life, not praise for being a conqueror of a difficult dungeon, but this time it's a different story.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;It's slightly harder, this place. It would have been more convenient for me to be that kid around the corner. All the expectations and envy are just a burden.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;For Mars and the girls, conquering dungeons is a means to an end, not an end in itself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;First of all, being a dungeon crawler means being a wealthy person.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If they want a peaceful life, it is better to hide the fact that they are richer financially than others.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That is why Mars and the girls have come this far without settling down or setting up a base of operations, even if they are extravagant.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This time, however, it would be more convenient for them to stand out with their unwanted accolades.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Many adventurers are standing here because they are waiting for something.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Given the fact that they are asking for adventurers and want them to disclose their achievements, it is clear that they are trying to select adventurers and get them to do something.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As proof of this, the dwarf receptionist looked surprised and went away with a piece of paper with Mars' writing on it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There's been an increase in the number of adventurers with momentum lately, haven't there?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yeah. Two of the Seven Great Dungeons in the world have suddenly been conquered&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The waiting adventurers were drinking and chatting.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They appeared to be older than Mars, but their eyes were glazed over with ambition.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Two of the Seven Great Dungeons have been conquered?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The reason Mars couldn't help but listen in on the conversation was because of the shocking things he heard.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;One of them was, of course, the &#12302;Great Norn Tomb&#12303;, which Mars and the girls had conquered.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;but what about the other one?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No one entered the dungeon because they were scared of the legend, but once you get in, it's probably not a big deal. We should follow suit. It's not just a dream to get rich and become a nobleman or even a king!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Aside from the &#12298;Witch of Disaster and Raimei&#12299; faction in the Norn Tomb, I heard that &#12298;Jet Black&#12299;conquered the &#12302;Great Volcano of Regalia&#12303; all by himself, right? If women, children, and lone adventurers can make it at such a level, there is actually plenty of time to spare if there are enough of us. With that many adventurers, we should be able to conquer this dungeon without any trouble.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;My share will be smaller, but I'll still be able to play and live for a while!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They laughed loudly and cheerfully. They were licking their lips at the dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is a guise and tension that they probably have never been conquered in even a small dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The quest for the unknown, greed, and ignorance that make people who give birth to these reckless adventurers.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though he is not so tense, Mars has been striving to master the manipulation and enhancement of his body since his reincarnation and from his childhood.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki is first of all definitely in the realm of genius, and Lilia and Nemu are also strong simply because of their race advantage over humans.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The adventurers were able to conquer the area because they were able to reduce their burden and proceed efficiently, and it was certain that Mars and the others would lose their lives at some point if they took on the challenge without any plan.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Adventurers stop thinking, do not train, and just follow their dreams, not understanding their position. It is only through hard work and thought that talented people can conquer dungeons.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They will know this fact when they face death, which they cannot escape.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They learn at the price of death that having a lot of people is not much strength if they only have a lot of dead people.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#12298;Jet Black&#12299;......Is there anyone who has stepped through the Seven Great Dungeons alone?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Th-That also surprises me, but...... &#12298;Witch of Disaster and Raimei&#12299; faction? Raimei must be Master, but &#12298;Witch of Disaster&#12299;is, don't tell me......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a twitch in her eye, Lilia tries to see Hazuki behind her with just her eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although she understood that they were talking about themselves, Lilia was shocked because she could only think of one person who corresponded to the &#12298;Witch of Mischief&#12299;.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The fact that Hazuki, and not Mars, was the main focus of the discussion was also not to Lilia's liking.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, Lilia also admits that Hazuki is a powerful person who is capable of being given such a nickname.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;For example, the current Hazuki could easily burn down everyone in the hall.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The &#12298;Witch of Disaster&#12299; ......! I'd love to be called something cool like that!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Good for you. Your wish has been granted. W-well, I admit that the pervert woman was a big part of it last time, but ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who had been looking like someone else's problem, finally understood by Lilia's reaction that she was called the &#12298;Witch of Disaster&#12299;, and for some reason checked left and right as if she was crossing the street.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What, could it be, are you talking about me!? &#8213;&#8213;Super beautiful girl with a disaster level of cuteness meaning!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No, I think it means a powerful magician. Don't be smug. And don't say such nonsense while clinging to my back.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You replied very calmly ......! You said I was your best friend for a thousand years!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;.......I didn't say that. I thought about it for a minute and didn't say it. Aren't you, pervert women seriously delusional ......? You have fabricated similar memories before, haven't you? &#8213;&#8213;Ah, I consider you an f-friend, okay?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's the part where you say, &#12302;Hey! Let's be friends, sisters!&#12303; Let's be cheerful like that! Heeey!&#12300;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Let's stop even becoming friends. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia ignored Hazuki's high-five.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Not remembering the words, Nemu nodded her head and tried to combine the words she knew.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She was still clueless about words that are not commonly used in daily conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's a difficult word to say it-nya. I don't know either of them-nya. Nemu has to study more-nyaa!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's &#12298;Witch of Disaster&#12299;! Isn't it cool!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;......? The lowest pervert, nya ......?&#12301; <span style="font-style: italic;">[TLN:&nbsp;災禍の魔女/Saika no Majo(Witch of Disaster),&nbsp;最下の痴女/Saika no Chijou(The lowest pervert(woman))]</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Huh, it was a cool name, but now I'm being made fun of!? No, it's been converted into a word that Nemu-chan knows!? &#8213;&#8213;But it's sad to say that I feel like I'm not wrong when I'm with you guys!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As usual, the hall was buzzing with noise.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The eyes of the nearly 500 adventurers were fixed on a figure standing at the entrance.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Standing there was a man in black armor from the top of his head to the tips of his toes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;His physique indicated that he was a man, but his race was unknown because his skin was completely uncovered.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He was empty-handed and carried no weapons.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even looking through the narrow slits in the eyes of his helmet, they could not see the movement of his eyes, but he looked around at everyone in the hall, exuding a sense of intimidation that could be described as hostility or even murderous intent.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The black full-body armor seemed to blur the outlines of his entire body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars thinks of gazing at it, it wavers like a heat haze. The armor itself seemed to have magical disrupting effects such as illusions.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The black-armored man walks with the openness and leanness characteristic of those who have trained in the martial arts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Everyone silently observes him as he walks to the reception desk.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The young Dwarf at the reception desk, who had been responding to the man in black armor with an air of unmotivation until Mars submitted his paper, straightened his back, and straightened his small body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I am here to conquer the dungeon.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That's all the man in black armor said to the receptionist.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Perhaps because of his helmet, his voice was muffled and the quality of his voice was not clear.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The receptionist was intimidated by the power of the man's voice, but his demeanor changed when the man in black armor acted.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The black-armored man thrusts his right arm into the &#12304;Treasure House of Dreams&#12305; and pulls out a black spear with a spiral red line on it, which is a magical weapon at first glance. It was an umbrella-shaped spear, like a heavy cavalryman's, that would expand and destroy the target it pierced from the inside rather than penetrate it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The receptionist held up the pickaxe on his back, but the black-armored man put the spear away again without further action.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In short, Mars understood that the man was trying to tell him that he was a dungeon attacker and that he should challenge the dungeon quickly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A murmur of surprise and fear rises from the adventurers.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars had never even heard of him until just now, but he must look like the rumored person in this outfit.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Is this the &#12298;Jet-Black&#12299;?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars is convinced when he sees the &#12304;Treasure House of Dreams&#12305;, the proof of a conqueror.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is difficult for a lone adventurer to conquer a dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The level of &#12298;Jet-Black&#12299; was enough to convince everyone.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;First of all, there is almost no advantage to being alone when conquering a dungeon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Too many people can be a disadvantage, but even so, the odds of winning the dungeon are better if there is some division of labor.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars' first attack was done alone because he was more afraid of his makeshift team, but that was only because there were others ahead of him and there were fewer obstacles.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Now that he has various kinds of magic, he is confident that he would die alone in the Seven Great Dungeons, even though he can attack them with more confidence than before.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#12298;Jet Black&#12299; was also handed a questionnaire-like form by the receptionist, but he turned it in without filling it out.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even though he would have been kicked out immediately, there was something in the aura that &#12298;Jet Black&#12299; exudes that made it acceptable.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The dwarf at the reception desk hurriedly ran somewhere again.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But his speed was not so fast because of his short legs.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars and the others who had conquered the &#12302;Great Norn Tomb&#12303; and &#12298;Jet Black&#12299;, who was believed to have conquered the &#12302;Great Volcano of Regalia&#12303;, gathered together for the first time in history to conquer the Seven Great Dungeons.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A few moments later, the sound of a loud bell rang out, and the eyes of the adventurers were drawn to a young girl.</p>
