<h3>Chapter 10</h3>

p class="calibre">&#12288;At midnight, unusually, they sleep separately.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu is the only one with Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki has holed up in the room with Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It seemed like a very quiet night when it was just the two of them. As expected, they had no desire to engage in sexual intercourse.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Somehow, Nemu doesn't feel very sleepy-nya. Nemu is lonely-nyaa ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Me too. &#8213;&#8213;I think I'll go check on Lilia, after all.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu's going, too-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars got up and walked through the darkened living room to Lilia's private room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Then he saw Lucille sitting on the floor of the darkened living room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu was not surprised to see her, as if she had noticed it with her night vision.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Whoa!? Y-You scared me!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm sorry ...... I'm sorry ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille did not react to Mars' shouts but kept apologizing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars knew immediately that the apology was not to him, whom she had startled.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;An apology without the other party.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is Lilia to whom Lucille is apologizing. However, her voice does not reach Lilia.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Lilia-nyan is in the hands of Mars-nyan. Leave this to Nemu-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;A-all right.........&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu remember what Julis said at the end-nya. Lilia-nyan has a lot of allies, but Lucille-nyan doesn't have any. That's why Nemu is here-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;............&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu looked at the ring that Juris had left behind, which she had placed on her thumb.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The ring was unadorned and looked a lot like Julis.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu must have something in her mind.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu may have looked carefree, but Nemu was still Nemu, a being who had nothing.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Julis, who cared about the slave Nemu, was an important person to Nemu, even if only a little.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;That is why she never forgot Julis's words and passed them on as her own flesh and blood.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was the first time Nemu had ever told Mars to leave something to her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Feeling strong that she is growing up, Mars leaves the living room, leaving Nemu behind.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Maybe I don't need myself here now</span>, Mars thought.</p>

<p class="calibre">&#9671;</p>


<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I'm the one who's to blame.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After being slapped by Hazuki, Lucille cried on the living room floor.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She said something she shouldn't have said.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The words that came out of her mouth were irreversible. The fact that she said them will never go away.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Because she knew she was at fault, she accepted Hazuki's slap with open arms.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She had gone to the trouble of becoming the adventurer she had always wanted to be, and she thought she had made a friend, but she felt a sense of hopelessness that her future had been closed to her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It was Lucille-nyan's fault-nya. Nemu had never seen Hazuki-nyan so angry-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I know that. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu, who remained alone in the living room, said to Lucille who was sitting on the floor.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu knows that she is not going to lie to the princess, nor is she going to make a fool out of her.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu is really angry, too-nya. Do you know that you told Lilia-nyan to die?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Yes, I did.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What kind of stone is in the dungeon? If we couldn't get the stone in the dungeon, would Lucille-nyan take responsibility for our death-nya? &#8213;&#8213;It's not fair to tell others what you can't do yourself-nya&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A child who looks stupid.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille, who had such an impression of Nemu, accepted her words so honestly that she wondered at herself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Without any additional knowledge, Nemu's thoughts simply go to the bottom of the matter.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I was greedy and force others to do things they are not obligated to do, even though I don't do them myself.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille is tempted to mock herself for being a coward.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The princess was angry because she didn't like it, but she's not a slave, so why not do what she likes-nya? Nemu does what she likes, though-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Doing what you like......is not&nbsp;easy. Aren't you a slave? What's with the collar?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's called "playful"-nya. Nemu was really just pretending to be a slave so she doesn't get bullied, but-nya? Nemu likes to be with everyone-nya. She chose this place by herself-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille gets up and goes to the table.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Her cheeks were swollen and hot rather than painful. The pain that lingered in her cheeks made her feel guilty.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu has been studying hard lately-nya. Mars-nyan says that you have to be able to do many things in order to do what you love-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;......What are you studying?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;On the table, there were books of various genres piled up messily.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Various things-nya. Nemu wants to write a book-nya, and Nemu also wants to teach something to someone-nya. &#8213;&#8213;But most of all, Nemu wants to know what everyone is thinking-nya. Nemu is not very smart, you know-nya? Nemu doesn't always get along with everyone-nya. Because It's embarrassing and she's boring-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu looked a little sad and drooped her ears.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Beastmen are not very intelligent. Lucille, who had looked at Nemu with such a preconceived notion, was again ashamed of her own shallow thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She hated being reminded that she was selfish and had a bad character.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Apologize and try your best to be liked-nya. Nemu thinks you can still do something about it-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I can't do anything about it anymore.......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But if you don't makeup with them, you'll have a hard time from now on-nya. Otherwise, you won't be able to stay with Nemu and the others-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;............&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I wanted to be an adventurer.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I wanted to become an adventurer, save my country, and marry a hero I recognized.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;My hopes are far from fulfilled. A thoughtless statement took me far away from everything.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Sorry was also a word to my old self who was chasing a dream.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Either way, as a princess, I had no choice but to follow the king&#8213;my father. The truth is, I was forced to enter this dungeon by force. If this happens, I have no choice but to leave. Originally, I was told to come back if it didn't look like I could make it. The Imperial Guards outside are planning to bring me back after they get a little further. My limit is up to the middle layer, which I know from Onyx's search.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lucille-nyan, you're like a slave, aren't you-nya? If you hate being a princess so much, you should be a king who can do whatever he wants-nya&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm, become the king ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Can't you be the king-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I had never thought about it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After all, the princess is a tool called a <i>princess</i>.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;So she is clearly given the role of bequeathing her offspring.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I've been living to fulfill that role all my life.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;If I tried harder if I changed my mind, could there be another way?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But ...... It's impossible. I will be married to Onyx. There are such rumors in the royal court that even reach me. That's why he's going to be king.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The "nationwide" thing is just a front. It is a national race. (?)</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As Mars and the others had predicted, the adventurers were pawns in the race.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Having lived through the intrigues of the royal court, Lucille has a good intuition for such plots.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although her father had not explicitly told her, she could at least guess that the dungeon attack was being planned for that purpose.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The Imperial Guards who came along with her included operations staff members, so it was even more obvious.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Do you like that big guy-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No, I don't. I rather dislike him.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then it's strange for you to get married-nya! Nemu heard that you get married to the person you love-nya. That's why Nemu is going to marry Mars-nyan!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille didn't think she could explain the values of royalty to Nemu.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although Onyx Lordlight is neither a noble nor a commoner, his power and presence are strong, and he is highly popular among the younger generation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He is not well-liked by the old lineage-oriented Dwarven nobles, but he is still definitely the most promising candidate.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What if Lucille-nyan did not get married-nya? Then, since there are only princesses, wouldn't Lucille-nyan be the king-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That is ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;There is no precedent for this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Dwarves have never had a queen.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, there is a possibility that she could take over the throne temporarily if her father were to die unexpectedly.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Many nobles do not think well of Onyx, who originally came from a commoner background.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I thought about it until ...... if I bundled them together and put them behind me, and realized that if Onyx accomplished conquer the dungeon, it would surely fail.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If you are the hero of the clan that saved the country, no matter how commoner you are, power comes with it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;If I was the first to conquer the dungeon, I could become queen. That way Onyx wouldn't be able to seize power.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You should tell that to Mars-nyan. He'll cooperate with you-nya. Nemu will help too-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I wonder if he will help me ....... I hurt someone he cares about.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu was sure he's mad at you for bullying Lilia-nyan, but Nemu is sure Mars-nyan knows that royalty is like that, so surely if you apologize properly he'll forgive you and help you make things right-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Whatever the case may be, I want to apologize properly too&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu thinks you should tell that to Lilia-nyan, not to Nemu-nya?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She giggles.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Thinking back, Nemu is the first person to give Lucille such a straightforward opinion.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;But is he really going to cooperate with me?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nyaaa......Nemu doesn't know how to say this, but Mars-nyan is planning to make someone else king from the beginning-nya. Nemu and the others can't be king because we can't stay in this country forever-nya. But Mars-nyan wants a machine that can turn into a fish, so we were talking about getting along with Lucille-nyan and borrowing it-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a puzzled brow, Nemu said reluctantly, looking distressed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;To Lucille, Nemu seemed to be choosing her words carefully.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Nemu could not say that Mars was trying to cuckold Lucille from the country.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I see, that man doesn't want to be king. Is he selfless?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille's heart ached a little.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;She couldn't figure out why.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mars-nyan goals are different-nya. His goal is for everyone to live a long life-nya.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Live a long life?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Right-nya. Nemu has heard that Lilia-nyan will live a very long time. That's why Mars-nyan wants to have a long life so that we can all live together-nyan&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;...... How? It's not uncommon for us long-lived races to live for a thousand years.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There is a magic book at the bottom of the dungeon-nya. Maybe there's a way to extend our life span-nya......? That's why Nemu is on an adventure with everyone-nya!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I know that much too. The &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305; allows you to obtain magic that is normally unobtainable.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Even dwarves with no aptitude for magic will be able to use magic, and even non-standard magic at that.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Extend his life ...... to live with that elf.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Oh, that man doesn't want to be king because he doesn't intend to choose me.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There's no future walking next to the one you've always dreamed of.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille felt the prickling pain in her chest again.</p>

<p class="calibre">&#9671;</p>

 
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars went to Lilia's room, he found Lilia and Hazuki lying on the bed cuddled together without a futon.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They were lying on their sides in an embracing position.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki's head was nestled in Lilia's chest.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;She must have come to comfort me, but she cried for a while and then fell asleep.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the twilight, Lilia lightly stroked Hazuki's sleeping head and said in a dumbfounded, yet happy voice, making her look like a mother.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia hugged Hazuki with her breasts, which Lilia normally would not let Hazuki touch first, and showed her tenderness like a loving mother.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hazuki-chan was extremely angry. I've never seen her so angry.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I wanted to see it. I can't imagine for a moment that this child would seriously turn against anyone. Our fights are fights that are supposed to be made up, so it's not a very caustic situation.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;<span style="font-style: italic;">That's certainly true</span>, Mars thinks to himself as he looks at the two of them.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The arguments that these girls have daily are so-called "fighting games," and they are not really angry nor do they intend to harm each other.</p>


<img src="https://i.imgur.com/zl4tqA4.jpg"></img>


<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's an easy fight because they know the distance, their relationship, and their roles.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki was furious for Lilia's sake. Hazuki, who is shy and avoids even the slightest altercation. Lilia must have found this irresistibly pleasing. She had never had anyone in her life who was willing to put aside her reputation for her and stand by her side.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Perhaps, for this reason, she literally opened her heart and accepted Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You see, I think it's okay if Lilia doesn't forgive Lucille-chan, even if it puts us at a bit of a disadvantage.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;......To tell you the truth, I can forgive her. It's a phrase I've heard repeated over and over for decades. The reason I was distraught earlier is&#8213; Mars, I didn't want you to know. I'm sure I won't be able to live if you tell me the same words. Just to think of it...&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There's no way I would say that you know? I'm not going to let you die no matter what. If you want a role other than a princess, the role I'm going to give Lilia is to live long and live happily by my side.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Was that a little cheesy?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After Mars says it, he feels a sudden rush of embarrassment.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even in his previous life combined, he didn't have the character to say such a cheesy line.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia shows various expressions one after another, from tearful faces to smiling faces, like a hundred faces.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Can you please use the slave crest? Give me the order you just gave me.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Eh ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Even though I am a slave, Master has not ordered me to do anything so far. &#8213;If your first command is such a wonderful one, I will comply with it with all my heart and soul&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Looking at the slave crest on the back of his right hand.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is just a tattoo that has never been used since Lilia and Hazuki's were engraved.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars was not comfortable forcing them to obey his orders.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He knew Lilia as an individual and did not want to do anything that would twist her will.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;This is not an order. It's a request. And I'm a little worried about giving that order with a slave crest,......and I think it's going to leave my brain pumping out pleasure chemicals. It's like, <span style="font-style: italic;">I'm happy, but I'm not!</span>&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ah, ahh, it could be a physical thing like that. ......&#8213;&#8213;it's not tight, is it? It was a situation where you could have dressed up.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yeah, I guess. I'm not very good at dressing up. I'd like to be a little cooler.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Good looks are not only in what you say and do, right? It's more about the casual things they do in their daily lives, such as taking care of themselves. Not using the slave crest is one of them.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia smiled, although some sadness remained on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If that princess ever apologizes to me, I will forgive her. It is more beneficial to be able to get along with her, even if only on the surface, than to be carried away by temporary feelings, considering our purpose. Please do not change your plan. Let's drop the princess and get her to cooperate.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's where I'm a little sensitive. ...... I don't know if I can like that girl. I never thought she would say something like that to Lilia. &#8213;I think I might actually be madder at her than Lilia.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Thank you. I'm satisfied now, you know. There are so many people who get angry for my sake. &#8213;&#8213;Why don't you just embrace her even if you don't like her? A few times and she'll be hooked.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I knew it, you're still mad at her, aren't you? I'm not a rapist, okay? Besides.....It's not for everyone.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Anger rooted in the mind doesn't dissipate quickly. Personally, being held by Master is like a reward, but in case you're wondering, the other party is royalty, so forcing her is certainly not a good idea. This girl, Hazuki, seems to like the idea of being forcibly desired in such a way...&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia laughs lightly as she lovingly strokes Hazuki's head between her breasts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, whose proclivities are quite masochistic, likes rape-like play.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I think it's a preference based on a sense of security that she won't be seriously abused like she was in the fight with me, though. (?)&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I bet. It's like Zerius refused to do it. I should help Lilia and Lucille-chan make up too, right?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If possible. Because at the moment, we don't even have a chance to talk. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I have never mediated a fight before, but I had no choice but to do it.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Even though I was a bit nervous about it, I thought I would be the best person for the job.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Lucille-chan was in the living room earlier and kept apologizing in a daze. I guess she's reflecting on herself.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I was too emotional for my own good.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I'm sorry I couldn't do anything.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's all in the past. There are probably very few people from that time who are still alive, and I am sorry for the members of my clan, but I don't think that I would want to take revenge against humans now. Killing a few people has no impact on the world. &#8213;&#8213;I have traveled around the world, and I have only come to realize that this world belongs to humans to the point of no return. So even if I had a royal responsibility, I don't feel the need to abide by it now.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;If you think about it without emotion, it is foolish to think about revenge,</span> as Lilia says.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, Mars understood that Lilia was consciously hiding her emotions.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia does not speak out about the important things. She does not reveal the wounds that lie deep in her heart. But what she really wants to say is on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;She would probably like to get it back if she could.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If I hadn't been bought by Mars, I would probably still be living in a daze, resenting humans every day. &#8213;&#8213;I am so glad that you bought me. I am happy now. I have a wonderful lover, I have friends,.......That's why I can forgive that princess&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I can't do anything about her past.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;And the Lilia I love is the Lilia that was born because of such a gruesome experience.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Say, Lilia. I'm not saying all of it. But if you could take back some of the lands, would you take it back?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;......the country?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Rather than a country......a territory, I think. I heard that the World Tree Forest is very large, so I think we can get part of it back. I know they feel like it was originally theirs(humans), but wouldn't we be able to buy it back?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is it possible ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Humans wanted the forest because it would be profitable. Then if there's a story that's more profitable than that, I think it'll go surprisingly well.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It would be unforgivable for Lilia, the person whose family and the clan were killed and robbed, but in essence, they wanted the World Tree Forest because they would gain from owning it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Profit. Nothing more, nothing less.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Then give them a profit that exceeds it.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;One more reason to break through this dungeon, right? You can never have too much money.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Please. I'd like to make a clan tomb too.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;All right. Then let's go to the World Tree Forest next. The sea and sky after that. Well, it looks like we won't be able to go either way unless we get along with Lucille-chan. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's frustrating that we can't do anything of our own volition. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Countries and politics are so hard to deal with.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars came here to comfort Lilia, but it turned out to be somewhat of a worldly conversation.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A little troubled, Mars scratched his head and sat down beside the bed where Lilia and Hazuki were lying.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;My principle of action is to be with Lilia. I can't choose how I'm born, but I can at least choose how I end.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I want to end my journey with a smile.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;No matter what happens along the way, if I can smile at the end, I'll be happy.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Once I know the end, I am very aware of the end I want.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's hard to live a thousand years, you know?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If it's such a fun thousand years, it's all I can hope for. I'm glad Hazuki-chan and the others are on board.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes. This girl said that we are friends for a thousand years, but I feel like this girl is really going to be that for me. I don't know if I should call her my best friend. Even among the elves, no one is closer to me than she is. And Nemu is Nemu, and she adores me.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hazuki-chan can't get along with someone she knows is a princess from the start. That said, I think Hazuki-chan will be the same as before. Both me and Nemu-chan, too.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They all know that Lilia doesn't want to be treated like a princess.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ehehehe ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They heard a little voice.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was uttered by Hazuki, who was wedged between Lilia's breasts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Wha, y-you were awake!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You see, I've been awake since Mars-san arrived.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki grinned in a happy voice while softly rubbing Lilia's breasts.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Th-Then get away from me!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I won't leave you, because I'm your best friend! Your best friend, you know!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Kuhh ......! I was saying an inappropriate remark that I thought she was sleeping!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I love Lilia-san, who's actually so sweet in her heart!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia was in an angry attitude as she pushed Hazuki's head, which was clinging to her. However, her face, which she was trying not to show to Hazuki by bending down, was smiling while she was embarrassed.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I will also apologize to Lucille tomorrow. You see, I hit her really hard.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It was a good slap in the face with weight on it. Not that it's a good thing because that's what she did, but...&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I feel like I went too far, and I still feel like I didn't do enough. ...... But if Lilia forgives her, I have to apologize properly too.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki has always avoided small disputes. Mars guessed that she must have some regrets.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The relationship between everyone and Lucille is difficult.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The same is true for Mars, who intends to stand on Lilia's side no matter what.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Let things be what they will be.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If he had been able to build relationships with people, he would never have been reincarnated.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars stopped to think that he should stop thinking about manipulation.</p>
