<h3>Chapter 17</h3>


<p class="calibre">&#12300;Cough, cough, ......! Are you alive!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars shouted as he crawled out of the pile of rubble.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He should have moved to the edge, but a rock avalanche of shattered Hundred-Handed Giant had slammed him against the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was no sound except for a flurry of dust.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Onyx, &#12298;Jet Black&#12299;...... are they both dead?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the center was a mass of rock that was too small for the original body size of the Hundred-Handed Giant.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It was no more than ten meters in size at most.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars opened the treasury and called Lilia and the others. Mars cannot search alone.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master! Are you safe!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'm fine. I'm just tired. I just want to find those two. I think they're probably alive under this rubble. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The fatigue in his whole body had built up to the point where he found it difficult to even support the weight of Lilia who was hugging him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If Mars force himself to use &#12304;Body Strengthening&#12305; he won't be able to move, but after a muscle tear, a fracture will occur.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What could have made such a big golem shatter into such pieces......!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It was dropped and shattered. I guess you could say it was self-destructive.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille taps the debris with her war hammer and sounds a mixture of admiration and astonishment.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu can't hear anything because of the loud <span style="font-style: italic;">parapara</span>-nyaa ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I can't see ahead at all. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Are they still alive in this devastation......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Not to mention &#12298;Jet Black&#12299;, and Onyx has a body that doesn't look like it's going to die from this.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;I think they just fainted.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;At that time, there is a sound of the huge rock in the center moving.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars looked in that direction, thinking that Onyx might have crawled out on its own.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Oh, come on, seriously. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Emerging from the pile of rubble was a purple, slimy sphere about three meters in size.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It had six undulating tentacles coming out of it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It looks like a parasitic kind of monster, but ...... no, it is not.&nbsp;Those monsters are no bigger than the size of your fingertip at most. But then, what the hell is that ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I think that's the main body of the golem. I don't know if it's the core or not, but ...... well, that's the real deal. ...... I can't rest!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The sphere opens its eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There should have been six eyes, but half of them have been destroyed and only three remain.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The other side looks like it's on the verge of death.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I'll deal with them. But please don't take it to the next level, okay?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Pointing his sword at the eyeballs, Mars smiled tiredly.</p>

<p class="calibre">&#9671;</p>

<p class="calibre">&#12300;I still prefer monsters that can cut with a sword. It gives me a sense of security.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;The end was so quick. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Everything was shredded, including the tentacles, and the battle was over.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The eye-catching monster had no combat power of its own, and from Mars' point of view, it could be called a small fry.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I don't know what it is, but I think there's something inside. It was hard to the touch, and even I couldn't cut that thing.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Can I try to burn it and take out what's inside?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Sure. It was hard enough to be bone, so I don't think it will burn up.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yay~!&#12288;&#12302;White Flame Funeral!&#12303; &#8213;&#8213;Finally, the magic worked. ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki was in tears of joy.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In the wake of the sloppy burn and disappearance of the monster, there was a spontaneously glowing blue sphere the size of a human head.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;A bowling ball?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What's this ...... I've never seen ore like this before.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It may have been the core of a Hundred-Handed Giant......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's a beautiful round ball, nyaaa, it's hurt-nyaa!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Nemu touched it, it made a clunking sound and was sent flying away.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Nemu hands are tingling-nyaa~! It hurts-nyaa!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Scratching halfway, Nemu came to show her hand to Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was nothing out of the ordinary in her appearance.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Wasn't that magic power!? That round thing has tremendous magic power ......!? In my case, there are more than 100 million people, and that's not even close!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Hazuki, can you see the magic power?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia shoots Hazuki a look as if she were looking at a monster.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;? Yes, I can. What? Isn't everyone can see it!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I've never seen it before.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Normally, you can't see it. I mean, please tell me that at the beginning. ...... would mean that you know the strength of monsters and humans? If you knew that, our past adventures would have been a little easier.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;B-But I thought everyone could see it!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki was apologetic after Lilia gave her a light slap.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Common sense differs from person to person.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki was too much of a genius.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Perhaps the parasitic monster that Lilia had mentioned had come into contact with the magic power of this core and had become stronger.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Now I don't know what the truth is anymore.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I have no idea what to use the magic ore ...... for, which is much, much more powerful than the Thardonix Magic Steel&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Do you want it?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Eh, you're going to give it to us?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We're not planning on using it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If Mars were planning to use it for something, he would keep it, but he is not planning to use it and he doesn't want to leave something in his room that could hurt them if they touch it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It seems to be a substandard item, and it would be hard to get a price for it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He can't sell it to some random place, and if that's the case, it would be better to have it in a dwarven country that could become a friendly country in the future.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I hope it develops into steampunk!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'd be in trouble too if it was this big of a deal. Even if you do give it to me, I'd rather you keep it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I see. I'll put it on the shelf, then&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It seemed to hurt when Mars touched it directly, so he wrapped it in the clothes and shoved it in the treasury.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I forgot about Onyx and &#12298;Jet Black&#12299;! Everyone, hurry up and rescue them!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No need! &#8213;&#8213;I mean, help me!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Onyx's loud voice echoed from somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Looking closer, one could see a brownish hue mixed in with the white walls.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Are you burying your head in the ground again, ...... is that your hobby?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I was blown off and impaled! Because I'm a stone head!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He swings his butt around and Mars rescues Onyx, who is desperately trying to get out.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What a great experience.....&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Did you see what happened to &#12298;Jet Black&#12299;?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I was too busy taking care of myself. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Me too. My eyesight was glistening.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Exhausted, Mars sat down to be healed by Lilia and Hazuki.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He wanted to get to the treasure room of this dungeon quickly, but he had to stop to retrieve the Thardonyx Magic Steel.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Onyx was in good spirits carrying the Thardonis Magic Steel, even though it was right after he was buried in the wall.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He is the perfect person to carry the heavy stone.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It was so precious, but it's falling all over the place so much you can't help but laugh at it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille, sweating and smiling with dismay, was collecting the Thardonx Magic Steel.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It's an amount that makes it seem impossible to bring it all back.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Even if we put it in Lilia and my treasury, we can only bring back a certain amount of large items. Even so, there would be more than enough for 10,000 years of barriers.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;If I bring this back home with me, the country will grow tremendously. Becoming a queen is suddenly very real. I have to admit If I say I'm going to go to another country with the Thardonix Magic Steel.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;It's a good move, but it's a strong one. The benefits far outweigh the disadvantages.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars looked at Lilia, who was healing him next to him, her expression was changing from one to the other.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A happy face, a sad face, an anxious face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The emotions are attributed to whether or not there is a &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305; in this dungeon that manipulates lifespan.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I hope there is. But if there isn't, we'll just have another adventure like this. I will not give up hope until the very end. I'm sure there's something out there somewhere.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes, I'm sure. &#8213;&#8213; but I hope it's here.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars hugs Lilia as she looks lonely again.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's all right. I'll go with you anywhere.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Right, right! And dungeon adventures are fun, too! If we've come this far, why don't we just go to all of them!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;That's a good idea.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I can't go to all of them.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I wanted to ask &#12298;Jet Black&#12299; a lot of questions. But I guess ...... he isn't alive.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I can't handle this big rock by myself. Give me a hand.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You got it. Thanks, both of you. I'm feeling much better.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars is still a long way from full recovery, but he's back to being able to move around normally.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'd like to take it home with me if possible.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The huge rock left behind was about five meters high. It was originally about twice the size of the original but was broken open by the eye-shaped monster that was inside.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;This is the part of the Hundred-Handed Giant that was relatively intact.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is something moving? This rock.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's just your imagination. The golem isn't moving anymore.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No, no, it's moving!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't tell me ...... it's not dead yet!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;As Mars and the others took a step back, a crack appeared in the center of the rock.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With a loud crack, the huge rock split in two.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A black blur drifts out from inside, and a clattering metallic sound can be heard.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#12298;Jet Black&#12299; ......! Did you survive by digging a hole in the falling rock!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He was not buried like Onyx but had entered that space by poking his spear through it.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#12298;Jet Black&#12299; scurried around and realized that there was no air of battle.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Again. You beat me again, huh?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;? "Again"?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Fight me. If you lose, I'll take all the treasure here.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You'll get your share, too, since we conquered it together. We'll divide it among the number of people here. There is no need to fight.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The &#12298;Jet Black&#12299; shakes vertically.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The increase in the black blur told Mars and the others that this was due to anger.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;It's special. I'll show you something special just for you.&#12300;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#12298;Jet Black&#12299; reaches into his treasure room and pulls out a sword.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is a long sword, black with gold ornaments.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The blade of the sword, which came out with a high-pitched, unpleasant metallic sound, is as blurred and hazy as his armor.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I had decided that the sword would be the only thing I would use except in battle with you. &#8213;&#8213;Even if I die until I have surpassed you.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;You know me?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Of course I do. I will never forget the humiliation I suffered that day.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Does he know me from a previous life?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#12288;Humiliation. I have an idea........It is not that there are not.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No questions asked.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then the rule is single combat. If you admit defeat or lose your weapon, you lose. You can only use that sword. I only use this one sword. Be mindful of your surroundings.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Fine. But I'm going to win by killing you. And if you win, you get all the treasure. And don't ever say, "Let's divide up".&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is it because it hurts your pride. ......? Okay, I get it. I won't even give you a gold coin then.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;The lone conqueror of the &#12302;Regalia Volcano&#12303;, one of the Seven Great Dungeons of the world, &#12298;Jet Black&#12299;.......Can I defeat him?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hey, you two! Use the place we cleared out. I've prepared a proper arena. Let me see ...... Why don't we just let someone lose when they get out of here? It would be so boring to lose strongmen like Aniki and the others!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I don't mind.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Onyx prepared a circular ring about 10 meters in diameter.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The edges were made of pieces of Thardonix Magic Steel.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#12298;Jet Black&#12299; nodded his approval.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then let's get started. Lilia, Hazuki-chan. I'm sorry that you just used it, but I'm going to ask you to prepare the healing. I'm asking you to do it no matter who wins.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's all right. &#8213;&#8213;It'll be over soon. I'm exhausted and so is that guy.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Please win for sure!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;With Lilia's encouragement, Mars observed &#12298;Jet Black&#12299;.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Although Mars couldn't tell without paying close attention due to its nebulousness, the black armor was battered and full of dents.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Considering all the solo actions and battles he has been involved in, his physical strength must be at its limit.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars had a feeling that the victory would come in a flash.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;&#12304;Body Strengthening&#12305;. And then, &#12304;Body Strengthening&#12305; again and again.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mumbling, Mars repeated the same magic over and over again.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;No matter how weak &#12298;Jet Black&#12299; is, Mars should feel like he is dealing with the dungeon itself if he is capable of conquering the Seven Great Dungeons by himself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Here we go.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars closes the distance to &#12298;Jet Black&#12299; in a straight line and swings down from the top with half his body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A strong wind, like being behind the engine of a jet plane, hits the surroundings.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However, &#12298;Jet Black&#12299; sees through his speed and movement, and slides his body to the side, ducking and dodging Mars' sword.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;To prevent himself from being ruled out of the ring, Mars stepped forward as hard as he could, held on, and ran to the side.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But before Mars could turn, &#12298;Jet Black&#12299; had swung his sword at Mars' head.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars catches &#12298;Jet Black&#12299;'s sword with his hand on the peak of the sword and pushes it back with all the strength of his body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The two swords met each other a little outside of the distance between their swords.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The attack and defense so far lasted less than three seconds.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300; ......So strong! I've never fought someone this strong before.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I see, so strong, huh. &#8213;&#8213;The humiliation inflicted on you has made you this strong.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars can't make out his face, and he can't make out his voice because of the helmet.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;But &#12298;Jet Black&#12299; seemed to be smiling.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;......? I think I've seen his sword before. He fights by parrying ...... Like dancing&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Are you acquainted with the conqueror of the Seven Great Dungeons?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hm, Hmmmm......I think it was something more dull and dreary. ...... was it just my imagination?&#12300;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;Has he ever seen Hazuki-chan?</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The movement of &#12298;Jet Black&#12299;, which seems to slide on the ground while swaying from side to side, is difficult to grasp, and there is little time for thinking.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;It's over. &#12302;Ice Prison&#12303;&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Whaa, ......! You can use magic!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars' feet are covered with ice that has grown up from the ground before he knows it, and he stops moving for less than a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is easy to destroy the ice. However, there is no way that &#12298;Jet Black&#12299; would have missed the gap created by the lag.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I was swallowed up by the unspoken premise that we were going to fight with swords!</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;When Mars looked up from his feet, he saw &#12298;Jet Black&#12299; already swinging his sword horizontally in front of him.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Even if Mars tried to catch it with his sword, he would be blown away and ring out if he caught it with no power in his lower body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Considering his timing and reaction speed, Mars would be cut even if he dodged to the left or right.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;If Mars jumped backward, he would choose to ring out himself.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After much thought, he came to the conclusion that he should go up. Then, he moves forward.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He received the sword with his sword, grabbed the &#12298;Jet Black&#12299; helmet, and jumped over.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;In his hand, he felt the &#12298;Jet Black&#12299; helmet come off.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I remembered!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki shouts, and at the same time, the face under the armor turns toward Mars.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A beautiful young man with silver hair and a condescending look in his eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars knew who it was.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;Zerius!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Didn't you recognize me?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No, I couldn't make out your face, and it was hard to hear your voice. ...... You probably couldn't hear much either, right? A lot of times the conversation was one-way.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;This black armor is only effective when worn in its entirety. Even if it is a little difficult to hear the sound, the advantage is far greater&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius Laclair.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He was Hazuki's former lover whom Mars encountered in the dungeon &#12302;Sekhmet&#12303; where he first dived with Lilia, and he was the man who had cheated Mars of his second name, &#12302;Raimei&#12303;.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He used to wear pure white armor as his trademark, but he had changed his look.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What the hell, you should have told me when we met. You said a lot of meaningful things.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;I haven't forgotten the humiliation you put me through. I have no intention of getting along with you.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Humiliation......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#8213;&#8213;Hazuki! You took her from me, and then you showed it in front of me. ......! And after all, she said, &#12302;You can't do anything&#12303;!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars glanced at Hazuki, and she was nodding her head with a troubled look on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There seems to be an attachment to Zerius, but not one bit of attachment on Hazuki's part.</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I'm glad I didn't hear him thanks to the helmet.&nbsp;Hazuki-chan just said it sounded dull and dreary.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I didn't like Zerius at all before we entered the dungeon, you know? It's like we're just meeting for the first time. ...... I don't like you because you're not cool inside, and I don't like your limp dick!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki makes a cross with both arms.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;The &#12298;Jet Black&#12299;, or Zerius, was shaking his entire body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;This is what I'm talking about ...... What did you do to Hazuki! I got the &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305; myself and found out ......! With the magic in this book, you could easily control a person or two!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You're mistaken. Hazuki-chan has been like that since we met.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Th-That can't be true. ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Err.....Are you idolizing me? It seems like I'm being idolized, but Mars-san didn't do anything to me you know? I just don't like Zerius and I like Mars-san! On the other hand, do you have any elements that are liked ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki, who spat out harsh words in a frightened manner, made Zerius cower, holding his chest.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ugh......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't take more damage than your fight with me!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Master, let's kick him quickly. The termites just turned into black ants&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Everyone's so harsh!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Haah, and Lilia, who had lost her nervousness, began to join in the war of tongues.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I will never forgive you,......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ehhh,......, I gave you a magic weapon and some money that day.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Do you get it ......? Since that day, I don't get aroused by anything except the sight of my lover being cuckolded, you know!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Did you awaken into cuckolded ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;I feel sorry for him, that's for sure.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes, I fell into darkness. So I decided to dye my armor black and live a solitary life.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You're a ...... moron.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You broke my brain! Die!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Zerius thrusts his sword forward and rushes forward.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Driven by rage and straightening out, it was easy to avoid the attack and also easy to attack with a lot of openings.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars grabbed his arm to parry the attack and used the momentum to kick him out of the ring.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia and Hazuki blatantly avoided the flying Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I win. Your habit of getting all gaping when you get angry, you'd better fix that. I really thought you were the strongest at first.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I lost again. ...... Ha, Hazuki. ......!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't touch me! Because you are at the top of my list of people I don't like, okay!? You're so fragile and limp that there's not a single thing to like about you!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki looked at Zerius, who was clinging to her as if she were looking at trash.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;It is rare that Hazuki, a mild-mannered coward, reveals her dislike to this extent.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;We'll be the ones to conquer here, right?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#8213;&#8213;A promise is a promise. I admit it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I have no objection either! By the way, Aniki, don't you still want to take me with you?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I don't.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars averts his gaze from Onyx's lonely, hot face and looks toward the dungeon's treasure room.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A golden door adorns the white walls. It is the glorious door that all dungeon adventurers long for.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Everyone gulps.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;It's all right. I won't be disappointed if this dungeon doesn't have it.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yup. Let's not get our hopes up and hope for the best. &#8213;&#8213;Come on, let's open it!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Everyone all proceeds into the dazzling golden light.</p>

<p class="calibre">&#9671;</p>


<p class="calibre">&#12300;Fufu, fufufufu.......I knew it, I knew it wasn't there! Ahhh, I'm going to cry! Of course, it's impossible not to get my hopes up!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lilia laughed out loud, but her expression looked as if she was about to start crying.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;There was no &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305; to extend one's life span.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;However&#8213;&#8213;.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;This is like Magic of Immortality. ......! It means you can stay in this appearance, right!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Finally, something like that ......! Lilia! I still think there is a magic book that can prolong life!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Immortality, not quite, but immortality is magic beyond providence that has a profound effect on the physical body.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Is it something you can get one or the other ...... instead of both? If so, I wanted the immortality one first. ...... I can find any number of ways to die if you're immortal.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I guess. But don't you feel quite hopeful?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Yes!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They're doing a high-five and be happy for a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Ah! There's a stronger version of &#12304;The Treasure House of Dreams&#12305;! Lilia-san, here you go!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;...... I think Hazuki should read this. I have my own, and based on Master's example, it seems to disappear when duplicated.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I agree. In hindsight, it was a waste.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Mine ......! I'm so happy!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Hazuki hugged the book and laughed happily.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;There's nothing but treasures here, right-nyaa? There is no map like the previous place-nyaa.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No next clue, huh? Well, that was an exception because Norn was there.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Dangling from a jingling mass of necklaces and wearing a crown on her head, Nemu looked bored.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;No member of the group is interested in treasures now.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Lucille stood dumbfounded as she looked at the area where the gold and silver treasures were appropriately piled up.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Amazing ...... it's amazing ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You're saying the same thing as Hazuki-chan when she first conquered the dungeon.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I-I mean, this is nothing short of amazing! Even the national treasury doesn't have this many, you know!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I'd say there are roughly forty billion. It's not so different from the previous Norn Tomb. This time, we also have the Thardonix Magic Steel, so this one is even better financially&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars laughed at Lucille, who rolled her eyes, and this time went to Zerius.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;He was standing still as well.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Hey. How about we exchange the &#12304;Forbidden Magic Book&#12305;? We want the magic to extend our lifespan. If you give me that, I'll give you all of the magic books I have ......, I'll give you about 40 books this time, all of them.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I've read them all myself. And none of them were that powerful. It was all offensive magic.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;A tired-looking Zerius answers Mars' question in a disgusted manner.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;? You've conquered the &#12302;Great Volcano of Regalia&#12303;, one of the Seven Great Dungeons, haven't you? A dungeon of the same caliber as this one would have had at least one supernatural magic of some kind.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;.....What are you talking about? I've only conquered two ordinary dungeons.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What? Aren't you the &#12298;Jet Black&#12299;?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;&#12298;Jet Black&#12299;? I know nothing about that.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;&#8213;&#8213;It's not Zerius?</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;But ......&#8213;&#8213;come to think of it, Zerius has never claimed to be one.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;People just misunderstood him because of his appearance and took the rumors to heart.</span></p>
<p class="calibre"><span style="font-style: italic;">&#12288;Because he was actually strong. Because he didn't answer anything. And because Zerius didn't hear them, he neither denied nor affirmed.</span></p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then who is &#12298;Jet Black&#12299; ......?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Don't ask me. &#8213;&#8213;Do you think I can conquer the Seven Great Dungeons? In the end, I screwed up again, this time at the very end. I thought I got a little stronger. ......&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You can do it. If you can get out of the habit of losing your temper. Because you've come this far, and you were strong.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;I think it's one of my strengths to let my emotions get the better of me, though?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars laughs. Strong emotions are certainly a strength.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Can I ask you a favor?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;What? Do you still want the treasure?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;No. ...... Would you fuck Hazuki in front of me again? If possible, I want Hazuki to abuse me. That feeling of defeat...... was so frustrating that I wanted to bite my tongue off, but it was such a pleasure I'll never forget&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Are you a pervert!? I'm really sorry about that!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;Mars apologized seriously for the first time to Zerius, who clearly spoke out of turn with a straight face.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Let's just pack up the treasure and go home. The magic circle in the back will take us out. Of course, it will be divided equally among everyone except Zerius.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;You're giving it to me too!?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Isn't it obvious? What kind of Aniki am I who doesn't give his share to his little brother?&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Aniki ......! I'll follow you for the rest of my life!&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Please spare me from that. Live your life as you please.&#12301;</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;After treating Onyx appropriately, Mars returns to Lilia and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12288;They also use Hazuki's treasury to fill it with Thardonix Magic Steel and treasure.</p>
<p class="calibre">&#12300;Then let's make a triumphant return. &#8213;&#8213;When we go outside, we'll be treated like heroes. It will be different from your life so far, so be prepared.&#12301;</p>
