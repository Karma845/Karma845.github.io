<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p class="calibre2">Thank you for picking up this work.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am the author, Miku.</p>

<p class="calibre2">This is the 10th volume of the series.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would like to thank all the readers who have read this far.</p>

<p class="calibre2">In this memorable 10th volume, the sage, which can be said to be the beginning of everything for Yuuya, has finally appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Originally, I had hoped to introduce the sage at some point, but I did not expect him to make an appearance at this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I had some vague idea of the setting for the sage itself, but when I started writing it, I had a lot of fun writing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the unplanned part was no different this time, and I found myself surprised at the amazing turn of events that occurred in the story.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I am delighted that I was able to enjoy writing the story of the sage so far.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Also, on the Earth side, Merl has finally transferred to Ousei Academy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, I donâ€™t know what would happen if aliens came to Earth, but I just thought as I wrote that if we had enough technology to move freely in space, we would be able to do almost anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As with the story of the sage, I also enjoyed writing the main event on the Earth side, the athletic festival.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I wrote the story, I found myself thinking, I wish I could be a part of such an athletic festival.</p>

<p class="calibre2">At any rate, I think I enjoyed writing this 10th volume more than any other volume I have written so far.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, as usual, I have no particular plan for the next development, so I do not know what will happen next, but I hope you can look forward to it.</p>

<p class="calibre2">Now, I would like to thank the editor in charge for his great help this time as well.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Reine Kuwashima-sama, who draws cool illustrations for us every time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And I would like to express my heartfelt thanks to all the readers who have been with me this far.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thank you very much.</p>
<p class="calibre2">See you soon.</p>
