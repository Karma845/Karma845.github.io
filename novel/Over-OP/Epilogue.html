<h3>Epilogue</h3> 

<p class="calibre2">“Well, thank you so much! You’ve been a big help!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“N-no problem.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">A little while after I finished slaying the false dragon, Lanael-san came back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I really wish I could have helped you, but there was a movement with the main body of the False God just above and… I was called back. I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lanael-san bowed her head apologetically.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But Zenovis-san indifferently told her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If you and the others in the upper dimension had been more firm, this wouldn’t have happened.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ugh… T-that’s true, but…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Be that as it may, the false dragon has been defeated. You have no more business with us, do you? As promised, return Yuuya to his original time.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course, of course! B-but Observer-samas still want Zenovis-sama to cooperate with us…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zenovis-san looked at Lanael-san in a troublesome manner.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ve told you many times, settle matters in the upper dimension in the upper dimension. Don’t involve me in it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I-I know that! That’s why Observer-sama says he will welcome Zenovis-sama into the upper dimension!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I have told you repeatedly that I refuse to do so. Why do you insist on me so much?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In response to Zenovis-san’s genuine question, Lanael-san seemed reluctant to answer but spoke honestly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…The truth is, in the battle between the False God and Observer-samas, Observer-samas’ side is currently at a disadvantage… The reason is that the False God is trying to invade our world using a large number of sentinels, just like the Genesis Dragon that the two of you defeated. Their number is more than Observer-samas expected…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“In order to counter this army of false gods, we need to ask for help from beings with power equal to that of Observer-samas! But such beings are few and far between…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A-and Zenovis-san is one who fulfills that condition, isn’t he?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Lanael-san drooped down powerlessly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In this case, I should say that Zenovis-san is too amazing or that the observers are too different in dimension…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zenovis-san, who heard Lanael-san’s story, nodded without changing a single expression on his face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see. I understand what you said.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“T-then…!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I understand and refuse.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No way!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zenovis-san ruthlessly refused, and this time Lanael-san sank to the ground.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But there was more to Zenovis-san’s words.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“I refuse, but as an alternative… I recommend Yuuya.”</p>

<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yuuya-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was stunned by these unexpected words. I immediately understood the meaning of the words and shook my head in panic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W-wait! To recommend me… that’s impossible, isn’t it? I’m not as strong as you, Zenovis-san!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“For now, yeah.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I told you, right? You are strong. And there’s a good chance you’ll surpass me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“N-no way…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s why I’m recommending you. Of course, it will be tough at this stage, but I’m sure the observers will do something about that.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zenovis-san seemed to have already decided in his mind that I was going to go, and he turned to Lanael-san once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So, that’s it. You can take him with you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“N-no, even if you say that…!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">No matter how much Zenovis-san told me, it was not so simple to nod my head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, we will fight a powerful enemy just like the false dragon I just faced.&nbsp;</p>
<p class="calibre2">The false dragon was defeated because of Zenovis-san’s power, but it was not necessarily defeated because of the help of observers.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rather…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“B-besides, I’m going back to my own time, you know? So I don’t think I can participate in the battle against the false gods…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The passage of time is different in the upper dimension and in this world. By the way, the only reason Lanael was able to manipulate time to get time for your training is because she was forced to pull time from the upper dimension. And even if you returned to your original time, it would only be by a few days in the upper dimension.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is there really that much difference in the speed of time…!</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I thought this, Zenovis-san suddenly thought for a moment and realized something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I see. So this is how it happened, and you’re the one to inherit it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes?”</p>

<p class="calibre2">“Then let me put it this way. Instead of giving away everything I own, you should go.”</p>

<p class="calibre2">Zenovis-san smiled mischievously at me, and I was stunned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I didn’t know how and why you had inherited all my armor, etc., including my magic circuit, but… perhaps this is the moment.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“N-no way…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“At this moment, you are making a contract with me. That is why, in the far future, you will have my property.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The words struck me with such a feeling… that everything I had ever done before seemed to connect. [T/n: Yes, welcome, Time Paradox-chan.]</p>
<p class="calibre2">Why was it so easy for me to inherit Sage-san’s legacy when I first visited another world?</p>
<p class="calibre2">And now that I am here in the past, everything connects, including the fact that I am the first otherworldly person in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, there are still some things that I don’t understand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“B-but the future Argena didn’t know about me, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then Lanael-san, who had been watching what was going on, opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, about that… all the information related to this false god will disappear from this planet.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The fact that Yuuya-san had come to this time period and the existence of the Genesis Dragon, which became a sentinel of the false god, will all be erased from this world. For Observer-samas, the fact that the sentinel of the false gods was created in the lower dimension is an incident that they want to cover up…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see. I wasn’t particularly aware of this, but I suppose it is significant that we fought in this place. Of course, it would be harder for even observers to falsify information in a place where many people are present. But if it is just Yuuya and me, it is still possible to erase the information, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, that’s right. However, since Zenovis-sama is originally from this era, only the facts about Yuuya and the false god’s sentinel will simply be erased.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In other words, if I return to my original era, everything I experienced will be erased from this planet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But it’s still there as my memory, and it’s still firmly…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“S-so that’s why I didn’t hear about the other Genesis Dragon in the future…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I think that’s probably what happened… If there was only one dragon from the beginning, then the information must have been falsified.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Otherwise, there is no way Ouma-san would not have talked about it, and there is no way the world would not have noticed such a big event as the disappearance of one of the Genesis Dragons…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I understand that the information about the false gods, including me, will disappear. But if that’s the case, it won’t make sense for me and Zenovis-san to sign a contract here…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Since we will make a soul contract. That’s not a problem.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A soul contract?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Even if I don’t remember you, the one who made the soul contract will surely carry out that contract. In this case, I will have to make a lot of preparations for my successor without knowing who that person is.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I-I wonder if Zenovis-san doesn’t find it strange to be in such an ambiguous state?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I’d be absolutely creeped out by the idea of preparing a legacy for someone I don’t know who is, and I’d probably throw it out in the middle of the process…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“There’s nothing wrong with it. As long as I move that way, you would assume that there was some reason for it. If it were me, I wouldn’t be manipulated by anyone. I will always understand that I am doing it of my own volition.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">A-as expected of Sage-san…!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then Zenovis-san held out his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So, will you do this favor for me?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zenovis-san stared straight at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">──I have been able to acquire many important things thanks to the legacy that Sage-san has given to me.　</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have had encounters with Lexia-san, Luna, Yuti, and Kuro.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I met wonderful people like Master Usagi, Iris-san, Odis-san, and others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And… Night, Akatsuki, Ouma-san, and Ciel.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wouldn’t have the family I have today without Sage-san’s legacy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without anything else, I was just an abused high school student.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I would still be spending miserable days on Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But now I have a place on Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I can’t thank Zenovis-san enough.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is why…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I understand. I don’t know how much I can replace Zenovis-san, but if I can be of any help to Zenovis-san… even just a little…!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I shook Zenovis-san’s hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you.”</p>

<p class="calibre2">When Zenovis-san smiled gently, something warm permeated my body through my hand and Zenovis-san’s.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It stayed around my heart for a while, and then it seeped into my body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…This concludes the soul contract. You are now my successor.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Zenovis-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Zenovis-san told me this with a somewhat radiant expression on his face, my eyes lit up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well… Zenovis-sama is as extraordinary as ever… It’s amazing that you succeeded so effortlessly in making a soul contract that has a terribly low success rate and, if it fails, will destroy both souls…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Zenovis-san!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hahaha!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was surprised by the bombshell from Lanael-san at the last minute, Zenovis-san laughed out loud for the first time here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The next moment, my body was gradually enveloped in light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W-what is this?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, it looks like it’s started!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was panicked by the suddenness of the situation, but Lanael-san continued calmly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry! It’s just that Observer-samas are preparing to send Yuuya-san back to your original time.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I-I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the moment, I realize that it is not dangerous, so I look at the situation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What can I say… it’s a strange feeling, a little like the scene when you defeat a monster.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s like my body is gradually turning into particles of light and disappearing… but strangely enough, it wasn’t terrifying.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After all, the sage, Zenovis-san, is right in front of me. So I’m sure everything will be fine.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“──Well then, Yuuya. I’m really glad to have met you.”</p>

<p class="calibre2">“M-me too!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When it comes time to say goodbye, sadness comes over me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Perhaps sensing my feelings, Zenovis-san smiled softly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“After you leave, I will forget you. But my soul will remember you. ──May your future be blessed.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes!</p>
<p class="calibre2">At last, I can return to my original time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just as I thought that, Lanael-san dropped another bombshell.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, by the way, the Evil that was fighting Zenovis-sama here was called forth in the time when Yuuya-san was originally present, and that Evil will be brought back to this time with Observer-sama’s power, but it will be troublesome if he resists, so it would be helpful if you could hurt him moderately!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey! Eeehh──”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The Evil is supposed to appear right in front of you, so don’t think too much about it and just slash it with your sword!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hurriedly tried to ask for more information, but to no avail; I was sent back to my original time.</p></div>

<p class="calibre2">Immediately after Yuuya was transported to a past era.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The “Evil” ── Evil, who was fighting the sage, smiled wickedly. [T/n: The second Evil was his name.]</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well then… let the carnage begin.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Do you think I’ll allow that?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Ouma returned to his original non-standard size, he opened his mouth and his magic power converged into it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But Evil was still smiling wryly when he saw it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hahahaha! If you want to shoot me, then shoot! Then, after I have prevented it perfectly, I will teach you what defeat is!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“──Stop. I won’t let you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Woof!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then Yuti and Night jumped on Evil simultaneously and attacked him with everything they had, but Evil just stared at them blankly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You are just a nobody. Don’t get in my way.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Kyaa!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Kyaan!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Piii! Piiiiiiiiiiiii!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Night and Yuti are blown away by the wind pressure from a light wave of his arm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At the sight of the two, Ciel’s body was filled with flames of anger, and he charged straight at Evil.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmph. Now a fly. You seem quite confident in your power, but… it won’t work on me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Pii!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fugo! B-buhi…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ciel, who at the time of Avis had recovered instantly no matter how much damage he took and had attacked many times, for some reason could not heal the wounds inflicted by Evil’s attack and was blown away, as were Night and Yuti.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Quickly, Akatsuki transformed into a giant and caught Ciel with his body, but the impact alone nearly knocked Akatsuki down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As purely “Evil” as I am, I can block any ability and take away any life. There will never be another “Evil” as perfect as I am.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You bark so much!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Having finished converging his magic power, Ouma compressed it to the utmost limit and released it at the Evil.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The magic power that was released like a ray of light contained such power that even a slight brush of it could erase the person’s existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Perish here!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Facing such an attack, Evil held out both hands without even a thought of avoiding it. Stepping as hard as he could on his feet, he caught the incoming ray of light with his hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Nnn… nuoooooooooo!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As expected, Ouma did not think his attack could be caught with bare hands, and his eyes widened at Evil’s action.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Evil was desperately enduring while raising a tremendous cloud of smoke from his feet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“T-the blessing of our goooooooooddddddd──!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“””Hooray, hoor──!”””</p>
<p class="calibre2">The impact of the attack released by Ouma obliterated all the evil cult members present.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But──.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ku… kukuku…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Nonsense…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Despite having injured his arm, Evil was able to survive Ouma’s blow.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Kuhu… kuhahahahaha! How is this, O Genesis Dragon! This is my power! Now, next is my──.”</p>

<p class="calibre2">“──Haaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”</p>

<p class="calibre2">“Wha ── gyaaaaaah!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh… Yuuya!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Evil, who was continuing to laugh loudly, had his body bashed by Yuuya, who appeared in front of him without notice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The space in front of Evil’s eyes suddenly seemed to distort, and a glowing vortex appeared from it, and suddenly Yuuya appeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yuuya, in fact, had simply taken out <b class="calibre4">[Omni-Sword]</b> and swung it down without thinking much as soon as the transition was complete, as per the instructions given by Lanael before he disappeared before Zenovis.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore…</p>

<p class="calibre2">“I-I really did cut something, but it’s okay, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre2">He was still flustered about it after all this time.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>
<p class="calibre2">I felt the transition was over, so I took out the <b class="calibre4">[Omni-Sword]</b> as Lanael-san had requested, and I swung it down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, to say that I had no idea what I was doing was a figure of speech, but I was only aware that I had actually swung the <b class="calibre4">[Omni-Sword]</b> down at an opponent who was releasing a presence that I did not know about.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So when I looked again at the being I had slashed, I saw a man like Avis, who had become the ultimate perfect form, desperately holding down his slashed body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah, that guy…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yuuya!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Woof!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yuti! Night! And everyone else…!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Hearing the voices of Yuti and the others, I realized that I had safely returned to my original time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I tried to rush to everyone’s side, but that didn’t seem to be possible.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“D… don’t mess with meeeeeeee!”</p>

<p class="calibre2">“!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The man who was cut open by me stared at me with a horrified expression.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You bastaaarrddd! Where did you come from? If it weren’t for you, I could destroy everything in the world with my power right now!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I knew that the person I slashed at was definitely the “Evil” that Zenovis-san had originally been dealing with.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The only thing I don’t know is under what circumstances he came to this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know… but there is no way I can overlook the fact that he will destroy everything in this world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Dangerous. Yuuya, that man blocked Ouma-san’s attack as well.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm? Yuuya?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">If it had been me before, I would have despaired that I was no longer able to get a hold of him just because he had stopped Ouma-san’s attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, since I was sent to the era where Zenovis-san was, with whom we defeated the false dragon there, and was recommended by Zenovis-san to fight against the false god, I could not be afraid here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yuuya, you…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Ouma-san seemed to have noticed something about my condition and was speechless.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the “Evil” stuck out his right arm and concentrated his magic or “Evil” energy there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Perish!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The power of that attack was more powerful than the one Avis unleashed in the past, and if it landed anywhere in the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b>, this time, the entire land would be obliterated.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I calmly stare at the extremely compressed ray of attack, and I hold my <b class="calibre4">[Omni-Sword]</b> in the upper position.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And then──.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“───!”</p>

<p class="calibre2">──Cut.</p>
<p class="calibre2">With just that one thought in mind, I swung my sword down.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sword that I swung down collided with the man’s ray of light, and after a brief moment of struggle, it sliced through the attack as it was.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…..No, way…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Evil’s other half, which had been unharmed from the first attack, was also severely wounded now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The Evil fell to his knees, and suddenly particles of light began to envelop his body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“N-no way… am I going to go back to my original time…? Even though I have been able to come to a time without him this way…!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The man began to shout as if he had lost all his composure.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“H-hey! Somebody! I don’t care who you are! Heal my wounds! Oh, I’ll disappear, I’ll disappear! No! T-there is no way I can beat him in this condition──”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The man desperately struggled to his last breath, but the evil cult that had caused all this commotion was gone before long, and in the end, with no one to help him, he returned to the time of Zenovis-san’s existence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Finished, I guess?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yuuya!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Woof!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fugo!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Pi!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Waah!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone, including Yuti, hugged me, and I managed to hold on without collapsing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A-ahahaha… I’m back.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Question. Where in the world were you, Yuuya──?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment Yuti tilted his head in wonder, I encountered a situation that had a sense of déjà vu.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“──Aaaaaaahhhh!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">A voice was falling from the sky.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“Yuuya-saaann! I’m here to pick you uuuppp!”</p>

<p class="calibre2">When everyone looked toward the voice… there was the figure of Lanael-san, falling with tremendous force.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre2">Meanwhile, on Earth──.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Shirai. You are sure this information is correct, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Of course it is.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Then there must be a chance for us too…!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The document she was holding in her hand from the Ousei Academy has Yuuya’s picture pasted on it, and it contains detailed information, including his background up to this point.　</p>
<p class="calibre2">If only he would transfer to Nittei Academy, we would no longer be afraid of Ousei Academy! Shirai, I’m going to go scout for him right now!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Understood.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">──Thus, a new movement concerning Yuuya also began on Earth.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre2">Evil returned to his original time after being seriously wounded by Yuuya.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Gahah!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As soon as he returned to his original time, the wound he received from Yuuya had opened wide, and he fell to his knees as he vomited blood.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“D-damn it! This is… for this me to experience this…!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Struggling desperately, Evil managed to stand up and tried to leave the scene to heal his wounds as best he could.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, I have to hurry and heal my wounds…! Kuh… I have been so seriously injured by that incomprehensible being… I will never forget this──”</p>

<p class="calibre2">“──What are you talking about?”</p>

<p class="calibre2">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The words thrown at him so casually made Evil’s body stiffen.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was the voice of Zenovis himself; the very person Evil should be avoiding most at this moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ze-Zenovisssss!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm. I was about to slay you, but I didn’t realize you were already dying…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">With a curious expression on his face, Zenovis looked at Evil’s wounds and smiled, his eyes widening faintly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Hoh. It’s wonderful. Apparently, there is a swordsman somewhere who can reach you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If only you… if only you weren’t hereeeeeeee!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Evil used all his remaining strength to unleash an all-out attack.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But──.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“I don’t know what you’re talking about.”</p>

<p class="calibre2">A single strike.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Evil could not even comprehend what had happened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was cut to pieces by Zenovis’s attack, which was seemingly slashs at random, and he found himself with a single line running down his neck.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“N-nonsense──.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Evil’s head rolled off his torso and disappeared as it was, becoming a particle of light.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Zenovis saw this, he quietly looked at his hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…What a strange feeling. I feel an inexpressible sense of satisfaction, even though it was just defeating an “Evil.” It’s as if I’ve had some kind of interesting experience──”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zenovis muttered quietly and smiled.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Right. With this feeling, it might be a good idea to research new magic again. For example… magic that crosses over to a different world than here──”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Zenovis decided quickly and left the place.</p></div>
