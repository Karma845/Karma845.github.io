<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Daily Life After A Long Absence</h3>

<p class="calibre2">“Finally, tomorrow…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I ── Merl muttered inside the spaceship.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In my hand, I had the uniform of an educational institution called “Ousei Academy,” which Yuuya-san attends.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s strange, isn’t it? When Yuuya-san guided me around Earth before, I looked into this planet, so I knew there was such a thing as school uniforms… but I never thought I would be wearing one like this… “</p>
<p class="calibre2">The suit I normally wear is made to be comfortable in space and is made to fit the wearer in the most comfortable way possible. Moreover, if I operate the device on my left arm and collect data on clothing on Earth, I can use that data to adapt my suit to match the outfits on Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, what I have in my hands now is a uniform that was authentically made on this Earth, not a suit with the student uniform data put into it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So it has this kind of feel to it… although I’m concerned that the lower half of the body is not very protective…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">This skirt, a garment that I had worn before, albeit on data, was a type of shape that I had not seen on Planet Amel, so it was very new to me, but at the same time, it was somewhat embarrassing to expose my legs to this extent.</p>
<p class="calibre2">──Why am I holding the same school uniform as Yuuya-san like this?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was because of my father’s order when I was escorting Yuuya-san and the others back to Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Orders from my father.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is, to obtain Yuuya-san’s genes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If this were just to create a clone, it would have been enough to bring back some of Yuuya-san’s body tissues, such as his body hair. Of course, even so, I could not create a clone without asking for Yuuya-san’s permission.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But that is not what my father wants from me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He wants me to bring back the genes… in other words, he wants me to give birth to a child with Yuuya-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Uh…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">My face heated up as I realized this again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After I escorted Yuuya-san back to Earth and parted from him, I compared and verified my body with that of the human race on Earth to see if I could really carry out my father’s orders.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As a result, I found that it was possible for Yuuya-san and me to have a child, although there were some differences in the way our bodies were built.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The method for having a child is apparently the same on my planet as it is on Earth, so there is no problem there either.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However… I had no such experience yet.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On Earth and on Planet Amel, the relationship between men and women is exactly the same. They are connected to each other through their hearts.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In some planets, men and women do not communicate with each other, and this is common to the entire universe. There are also cultures that share partners throughout the planet, but this is not the case on my planet and on Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Regardless of that, I had never experienced a heart-to-heart… or, in other words, love.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No way, this me…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As the daughter of a father who is the representative of the planet Amel, I have lived my dream of ending the war with the Dragonias since I was born.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is why I had no time to even think about love.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W-what in the world am I supposed to do…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the meantime, I have been gathering information about attending an academy on Earth. For example, the range of subjects students will study and what is popular among students today.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In that sense, I don’t think I will have any problems adjusting to the school. The only problem was how to get closer to Yuuya-san…</p>
<p class="calibre2">From the perspective of Earth values, it is not a good idea to suddenly ask for genes. I-I’m in trouble too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It would take time, but this would be the most natural way to unite through love.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…What do I think about Yuuya-san…?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know about it myself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Our first meeting was not very good, with me storming into Yuuya-san’s house. But Yuuya-san forgave me for that, and on top of that, he lent his strength for us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though I was putting him in danger myself…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even on Argena, a world apart from Earth, Yuuya-san took it upon himself to protect me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Having traveled alone in space and lived under the watchful eye of the Dragonias, it was a new experience for me to have someone protect me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As to whether this is enough to make me fall in love with him, I don’t know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But there was no doubt in my mind that I was fond of Yuuya-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope Yuuya-san feels the same way…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…It’s no use thinking about this and that. You can’t know what you don’t.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Having changed my mind, I changed my approach and gathered different information.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was about what life was like for lovers on Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Let’s hold off on how to become lovers with Yuuya-san… it would be helpful to go one step further and see what people do after they become lovers. All that remains is… to set the data to be collected to the same age as Yuuya-san and the others…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I operate the terminal and gather information on how student lovers on Earth behave.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see… that there are such things as amusement parks and aquariums that are date spots.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was nothing else that looked too special, such as the usual commercial facilities, but facilities such as amusement parks were of some interest to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see… that amusement parks are places where not only lovers but also families and friends often go to play together.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Frankly, there is a lot that cannot be known from the data alone. But I would say I am now prepared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Now, all I need is for Yuuya-san and me to go to this place…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know what will happen, but I will do the best I can in my own way… that’s what I thought.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre2">A few days after picking up Kagurazaka-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Finally, summer vacation ended, and I went to school at Ousei Academy after a long time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Good morning, everyone.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah, Yuuya-kun! Good morning!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“L-long time no see!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I arrived at the classroom, my classmates, like Kaede and Shingo-kun, immediately called out to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…At my previous school, I used to get depressed after long vacations, but now I can’t believe that I felt lonely not being able to meet everyone…</p>
<p class="calibre2">We hadn’t seen each other for over a week, even though there were school days throughout the summer vacation. And since I was in space with Merl-san and the others fighting the Dragonia aliens, it felt even more like it had been a long time…</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I felt that way, the members I often chatted with gathered around, and our homeroom teacher, Sawada-sensei, came over to us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, you guys, take your seats. I have big news for you today.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Big news?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As everyone took their seats, they tilted their heads at Sawada-sensei’s words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then Sawada-sensei grinned.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, that’s right. What a surprise, we have another transfer student coming to this class.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eeh!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">At Sawada-sensei’s words, the whole class began to murmur at once.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Is the transfer student… a girl? Or is it a boy?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“More importantly, aren’t there a lot of transfer students lately? It started with Yuuya-kun, and then Yuti-chan came to the middle school as well…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Whatever it is, it’s unusual.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems to be a rare situation where transfer students arrive one after another, starting with me, after all.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder what kind of person is coming?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, come in!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“──Yes.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“!?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I heard the voice that answered Sawada-sensei’s call, my eyes widened.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eh? That voice was…!</p>
<p class="calibre2">To my surprise, it was a phosphorescent blue-haired girl ── Merl-san who entered the classroom!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unlike her previous suit, Merl-san is now dressed in the same uniform as the rest of us.</p>
<p class="calibre2">While everyone was stunned, Merl-san looked around at us and smiled when she spotted me among them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m Merl, and I’ll be transferring to this school starting today. I don’t know much about this country yet, so I hope you can teach me a few things.”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/jrkc6Ns/000002.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre2">“And well, as you just heard, she’s not from this country, so take care of her in many ways!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sawada-sensei tells us so quite naturally, but it is not so for me. I know that Merl-san is an alien, so I couldn’t think of anything yet…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I know it’s an unusual name, but… I wonder if she’s similar to Yuti-san?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s more unusual to have blue hair, though, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s with the glowing? Huh? Is it just my imagination?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, it’s normal to have glowing hair, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Normal… so, was it…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Huh? Is it possible that it is accepted as normal?</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seemed that Merl-san had already performed some kind of cognitive manipulation on the students in the class, and they all naturally accepted the fact that Merl-san’s hair was glowing. Ugh, space technology is as outrageous as ever…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“For the time being, your seat is behind… Yuuya. You see, it’s behind that prominent boy over there.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, I understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I stared at Merl-san with an indescribable expression on my face, she whispered to me as she passed by me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…It’s good to see you again.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah-ahaha…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I could only smile dryly at the unexpected reunion.</p></div>

<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre2">That day, many students, not only our classmates but also from other classes, came to catch a glimpse of Merl-san and asked her many questions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was afraid that they would find out that Merl-san was an alien somewhere along the way, but as one would expect from space technology. It seemed that Merl-san manipulated people’s perceptions so that she could fit in perfectly on the Earth, and she got through the ordeal without any problems.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I watched her from a distance, I noticed Kaori at the entrance to the classroom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kaori also found me and beckoned to me in a somewhat reserved manner. What is the matter?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Kaori, it’s been a while.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s been a while, hasn’t it? The last time we met was when Yuuya-san showed Merl-san around the town, right…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right… Huh? Perhaps Kaori knows about Merl-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Yes, I remember. Um, the space one, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kaori had encountered Merl-san when she and I were together before, and to my surprise, Merl-san’s cognitive manipulation didn’t work on her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“When my father told me about the new student, I was surprised that the person was Merl-san, you know? I think it is difficult in many ways for Merl-san, an alien, to attend this school, but her documents were accepted as if it were a matter of course, and…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, haha… well, about Merl-san, you see, it seems that space technology can manipulate perceptions in that area. So even though she has features that don’t seem earthly, everyone just naturally accepts her.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That is kind of… amazing, but also terrifying at the same time…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I understand what Kaori is trying to say. I am genuinely impressed by space technology, but more than that, it is a very frightening thing to be able to change perceptions, etc., without realizing it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t think Merl-san would abuse that technology, though…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But why did she decide to transfer to this academy?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Umm… that’s what I don’t really understand either…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is true that Merl-san said she had something to do on Earth but was it to enroll in this academy?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, I don’t think she’s trying to do anything wrong, and if I get a chance, I’ll ask her, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Right… haha. But even so, with Yuti-san, who is from another world, and Merl-san, who is an alien, coming to this school… It’s not at the level of internationalization anymore, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, sort of. And, if it’s possible, about Merl-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s a secret, right? I know. I mean, under the circumstances, if I told anyone, they wouldn’t believe me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since their perception has already been manipulated, they would not believe it even if we told them that Merl-san is an alien.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I was exchanging information with Kaori like that, I did not notice that Merl-san looked at me for a moment.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre2">After that, I tried to ask Merl-san why she came to this school, but the wave of people coming from other classes to take a glance at her, the transfer student, was so constant that I could not go to ask her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, it seems that she is accepted by the students without any problem, which is a relief for me…</p>
<p class="calibre2">After school, I was finally able to find Merl-san alone and called out to her.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Merl-san!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh… Yu-Yuuya-san! W-what’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, no, um… I was just wondering why you came to this school…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even though the ruckus with the Dragonia aliens was over, I thought that there must be something to do on the planet Amel, but Merl-san is now on Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So I thought she must have some purpose…</p>
<p class="calibre2">In response to my question, Merl-san began to fidget, and her gaze wandered.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“N-no, that… ah! Well, since I’ve come all the way to Earth, I was told to go study the culture of this planet! Yes!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I-I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Is it like studying abroad? It is true that the people of Planet Amel seem to have a long lifespan, so they may be able to have this kind of experience casually.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I was thinking about this, Merl-san said something in a whisper.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So, I was thinking that… if you would like, as part of this cultural research, maybe we could go to an amusement park together sometime…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh… n-nothing! W-well! I have some business to attend to later, so if you’ll excuse me!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh? Ah… she’s gone…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Merl-san suddenly began to panic and just left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the end, I did not know the detailed purpose of her visit, but I was relieved to see that it did not seem to be a big problem.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre2">The day after Merl-san transferred in.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On that day, too, I lightly asked Merl-san what she wanted to do on Earth, but she evaded my question.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wondered if it was something that was difficult for her to say. I was hoping I could help, but I can’t… force her to tell me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But I’m feeling a strange look from Merl-san, who’s sitting behind me in class… Did I do something wrong?</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was thinking about this, Sawada-sensei came over.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, everyone’s all here. Today’s homeroom is to decide what to do.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Huh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While some of the students were puzzled over Sawada-sensei’s words, some seemed to have an idea of what she was talking about and nodded their heads.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Some of you may have already noticed… that I’m talking about the athletic festival.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Athletic festival!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Okay, so it’s right after the summer break, but it’s that time of year already!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Of course, I have experienced athletic festivals at my previous school, but this is my first time at this school.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even the ball games were on a large scale, so I could not imagine what kind of level this athletic festival would be.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Naturally, Merl-san was unfamiliar with the athletic festival itself, so she was still tilting her head in confusion.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then Yukine, who was sitting next to me, told Merl-san and me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…As you can probably guess from the way the teacher told us, our athletic festival is very large scale.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As I thought…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Um… excuse me. I don’t know what an athletic festival is…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Simply put, the whole grade is divided into two groups, and they compete against each other in different events. But in our school, if you win, you get all sorts of perks.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Perks?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes. The most important thing is that the more you win, the more money your class can spend on the school festival, but there are also various other prizes such as free tickets to the school cafeteria for a month, the right to invite your favorite artist at the school festival, and so on.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“T-there really is a lot on offer here…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wasn’t particularly surprised about that since there was talk about the budget for the school festival, not just for the ball games, but even for the field trips.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the other supplementary prizes that I heard were absolutely extravagant. The right to invite your favorite artist to the school festival is… something that is unique to this school.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Yukine’s explanation was somewhat far-fetched, Sawada-sensei was unusually enthusiastic.</p>

<p class="calibre2">“Our class is the red group! The more you win in the competition, the more bonuses I get! You guys, give it your all!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So you’re making a lot of money there, aren’t you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Just like during the field trip, Sawada-sensei was getting the same kind of attention from the students. She doesn’t seem to have much trouble making money, though…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So, Kageno. The homeroom and the first period will be devoted to the athletic festival, so you’ll be in charge of deciding on the contestants.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You can count on me!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">In response to Sawada-sensei’s listless words, class committee member Tsutomu Kageno, who had also previously taken the lead in organizing the ball game tournament, smiled wryly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Before deciding on the contestants, let me briefly explain about the athletic festival. As the teacher had said, the athletes will be divided into two groups, the red group, and the white group, and they will compete against each other. And it is not only the senior high school but the entire school, including the middle school, that competes against each other. Yet, there is also the aspect of an inter-class competition. Depending on the results, the winners are given preferential treatment in the budget for the school festival, and there are luxurious extra prizes that only the class that comes in first can get… Well, it’s business as usual around here.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s really amazing that this school can say that’s how it’s always been…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“And it’s also unique in that the scores and the budgets you can earn vary depending on the event. For example, interclass relays get big points. With that in mind, we should carefully choose who will compete in which event.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, yes, one question! Does this mean each person can only participate in one event?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Kaede cheerfully asks a question in response to Kageno-kun’s explanation, he shakes his head.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, there is no limit to the number of events you can participate in. However, everyone must participate in at least one event. And no matter how athletic you are and how much you want to participate in all the events, you may not have the physical strength to do so. That’s why it would be best to give preference to those who are confident in the events they want to win.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I-I see… What can I say? The school I used to go to before was a very normal school, so there were no particular strategies or detailed rules, but in such a large-scale event, the strategy that each class chooses is important…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then Ryo raised his hand this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I understand the general outline of the event, but has the second prize been announced yet?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, we won’t know until the day of the event. So you should be fully prepared to compete in any of the events.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">From what I’ve heard, there’s a very good chance that the second prize for an unexpected event could be very lavish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Now… any more questions? If there are none, let’s decide which events to compete in. I’ve said many things, but honestly, I think it’s best to pick an event that you like, regardless of whether you win or lose. There’s no need to go out of your way to enter an event you don’t like.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey, Kageno. I don’t want us to lose.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, Sensei… We don’t want to lose either, but it’s important to have fun too…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kageno-kun smiled bitterly at the teacher’s words.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thanks to Kageno-kun’s quick and efficient progress like this, the events in which the students would compete were smoothly decided.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Although my physical abilities have improved dramatically thanks to my level-up in the other world, I was never very good at sports, to begin with. They probably wouldn’t believe me if I told them that with how my body is now.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Anyway, the only experience I had in the athletic festival at my previous school was in the steeplechase, so I hoped to do that again this time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In addition, I was recommended by others to participate in a cavalry battle and a tug-of-war. [T/n: Kibasen, which literally translates to “Cavalry Battle,” is a type of piggyback riding sport that is played in Japan.]</p>
<p class="calibre2">Tug of war is fine because it’s an event that involves a lot of people, but I’m not sure if I can handle the cavalry battle…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I am a little worried, but since I was recommended, I will do my best.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Incidentally, Merl-san, who probably doesn’t know much about Earth culture yet, seems to be participating in events where she has to cooperate with others, such as ball tossing and tug-of-war, for the time being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In space, Merl-san was fighting with the help of an extraordinary machine, but I wonder about her muscular strength and physical ability.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And so the events were being decided, and finally, it came down to the last event.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Now, all that remained was the mixed-gender three-legged race…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, the last remaining event was the three-legged race, in which men and women were paired together.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Up until now, we have been able to choose to some extent based on foot speed and strength, but this one is a little more difficult… If the height difference between the pairs is too great, it will be difficult to run… At any rate, is there anyone who wants to participate at this point?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When Kageno-kun asked this, several people raised their hands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Kanzaki-san’s partner, huh…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Haha… it’s kinda bad…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rin had also raised her hand, but there were no boys who could be Rin’s pair.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If we could find a pair for Rin, we would just fill in the number of participants…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm… Rin-chan is so fast, isn’t she?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As I said, I’m not as good as Kaede. It’s just that I’m so tall… If you want, I can decline and give it to someone else…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rin says so, but that would be a waste after she had gone to the trouble of raising her hand and expressing her intentions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since Kaede, a track team member, also said she’s fast, Rin must be pretty fast too.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Um… I-I’ll run if it’s okay with you…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh, Yuuya?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I raised my hand timidly, and Rin looked at me in surprise.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then Kageno-kun nodded in satisfaction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, Yuuya-kun, the height difference between you and Kanzaki-san isn’t that big, not to mention your physical abilities. May I ask you to do it for us?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yeah. I don’t have any experience with three-legged races, but I’ll do my best.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, I’d be grateful if you’d just run with me. Let’s work together!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Rin smiled as she said this.</p>
<p class="calibre2">──Thus, the events for the athletic festival were decided.</p></div>

<p class="calibre2">“See you later, Yuuya-kun!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yeah, see you.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After school.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I parted ways with Kaede and the others who were on their way to club activities, I was unexpectedly approached by Merl-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yuuya-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmm? Merl-san, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Actually, I have a favor to ask of Yuuya-san…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A favor?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">What is it? Could it be something related to the planet Amel?</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I was thinking this, Merl-san told me with a serious expression on her face.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“──D-do you know what an amusement park is?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…..Yes?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The unexpected words make me ask back.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Eh, an amusement park? Why?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“As I told you before, I came to this institution, this school, to learn about the culture of this planet. There is not much to learn in terms of science and technology, but in terms of culture, this planet is full of very interesting things. In fact, it is rare for me to find a school, an institution dedicated to education…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So you don’t have schools on the planet Amel?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes. All the necessary knowledge is inserted into the brain by electromagnetic transmission.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Space technology is amazing, as always!</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Speaking of which, where do you live now?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“For the time being, my ship is stationed above the academy, and I’m living there… I’ve already manipulated the perception of those around me so that others don’t feel uncomfortable when I move around, and I’ve also activated the camouflage function so that the ship can’t be seen.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It’s outrageous because she uses space technology so casually.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was relieved to see that life seemed to be going well for the time being.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W-well, I understand that you want to learn about culture, but why an amusement park…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ve been doing a lot of research on my own, learning from classmates about this country rather than the planet. I found out that I am what is referred to as a JK, and at the same time, I found data that JKs in this country often go to amusement parks. So, in order to understand what a JK is, I would like to go to an amusement park, and I would like to ask Yuuya-san to guide me there.” [T/n: As you probably already know, JK = Joshi Kōsei, means High school girl.]</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Isn’t the information too biased?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I wonder what kind of research method was used to obtain such biased data.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Besides, I’ve never even been to an amusement park…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Um… is it not good…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“N-no, not at all! Of course not!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I responded to Merl-san’s sad expression, her face brightened up.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank goodness! Then we should definitely go together on our upcoming vacation!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Y-yes…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The decision has been made, but… W-will it be okay?</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I was feeling uneasy, Merl-san looked at her watch.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, excuse me! After this, some of the classmates invited me to visit their club activities… Speaking of which, Yuuya-san, are you not involved in any club activities?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That’s right. I haven’t thought about joining anywhere at the moment…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was not originally interested in sports…</p>
<p class="calibre2">In that sense, I envy those like Yuti who have something they want to do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see… then I’d better be on my way. I’m looking forward to the amusement park!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Y-yes!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I nodded at Merl-san’s words, she blushed a little and continued, looking at me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Also, now that we’re classmates like this… U-um… Wouldn’t it be nice if you could stop with that tone of voice?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Y-you see, when you were talking to other people, you were calling them by their names and being frank with them… Well, I don’t want to force you to do that! It’s just… an opportunity.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I have certainly treated Merl-san with courtesy, but…</p>
<p class="calibre2">But now, everyone in the class was friendly, and we could basically converse in a casual tone of voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, I guess… well, then, since things turned this way… M-Merl doesn’t need to use honorifics either, does she?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“N-no! I’m a normal person by nature.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I-I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W-well, I guess I’ll be going then!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Merl said so and then left.</p>
<p class="calibre2">What can I say? I haven’t talked to her properly in a long time since she sent me back from the planet Amel, but unlike before, she seems strangely distant or odd… I wonder if I did something to offend her unknowingly. But then she wouldn’t ask me to change my tone or anything like that…</p>
<p class="calibre2">…I mean, now that I think about it, wouldn’t it have been better if she went to the amusement park with the girl who offered to show her around the club, instead of me…?</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I was thinking about this and that, as I headed for the shoe box, I ran into Kaori just in time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah, Yuuya-san!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Kaori! Is Kaori on her way home too?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes! Um… since we’re here, may I join you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since she invited me to join her, I ended up going home with Kaori until we were halfway there.</p>
<p class="calibre2">On the way home, the topic of conversation was about the athletic festival in which we had just decided on the events we would compete in today.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yuuya-san’s class is in the red group, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yeah… what about Kaori?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m in the white group. So Yuuya-san and I are enemies, right?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kaori smiles mischievously as she says this. However, her expression soon clouded over.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“But… With Yuyua-san as my opponent, I don’t think I’ll win…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh no! I’m not fighting alone, you know…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“B-but I’m on the white group, so…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed, I knew from ball games and playing together at the beach that Kaori was not very good at sports.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, just as I alone do not decide who wins or loses in an entire group, it is not set in stone that the white team will lose just because Kaori is not good at sports.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“By the way, what competition are you going to compete in?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I would be the ball thrower and the tug of war. I’m sure I won’t cause everyone too much trouble with these events, and that’s a relief!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I suddenly imagined Kaori doing the ball throw, but let’s not discuss how I could only imagine… hard balls flying all over the place. I’ll shut up about it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I parted from Kaori and went home, I found that Yuti had already returned home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Huh? You’re home early today, aren’t you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Affirmative. No club activities today.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Question. Yuuya, what group are you in for the athletic festival?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m in the red group.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I answered this, it seemed as if a fire was in Yuti’s eyes.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fighting spirit. I’m in the white group. We are enemies.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eehh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It turns out that Yuti is also in the same group as Kaori, and this time we are enemies.</p>
<p class="calibre2">T-this will be tough…!</p>
<p class="calibre2">Knowing that I had a strong opponent in the white group, Yuti, I was once again bracing myself for the athletic festival.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre2">While Yuuya was thinking about the athletic festival, in the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b> in the other world, a group of people were pushing forward toward the inner lands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Guaahh!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Kuh! Hold the line! We cannot die here! We must reach Yuuya Tenjou at all costs!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The group that kept advancing, desperately shouting warnings against the oncoming monsters, was the evil cult that Orghis were concerned about.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They were gravely wounded, but they never stopped moving forward.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After struggling through an attack by an unknown number of monsters, they took a breather.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Everyone, be vigilant of your surroundings. After a short rest, we will set out again!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Founder.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I have one question. From which era is the God we are summoning for this mission?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The god that the believers are referring to is not the “Evil” that Yuuya and the others recently destroyed, but the “Evil” that once existed in history.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Therefore, when asked again which era’s “Evil” they are summoning…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Right. The one we are summoning this time is the one who is called the most powerful of all time.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The most powerful…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yeah. But the abominable thing is that there was a sage in those days. Therefore, our God could not wield his power to the fullest and was defeated by the sage… But not this time! If we bring him to this age, there will no longer be anyone to stand in the way of our God. Besides, the abominable Yuuya Tenjou can also be buried in the place of our God. For this reason, we will surely reach the divine enemy Yuuya Tenjou!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I-I see! But I understand that Yuuya Tenjou is to be sacrificed, but is it possible for us to summon a God?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Don’t worry about that either. Certainly, in order to summon a targeted person from the past, it is necessary to have a catalyst for it. But the magic of the sage that we will use this time is the catalyst that will bring our God to us!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Aah! Because the God was defeated by the sage, the sage’s magic is the catalyst!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Exactly! Besides, we have a very small amount of “Evil” power given to us by God. If we use the magic of the sage and the residue of our “Evil” as a catalyst, we will surely be able to summon our God, who is said to be the most powerful of all time!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Come on, believers! The divine enemy is already there!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Unbeknownst to Yuuya, the hand of Evil was steadily growing.</p></div>
