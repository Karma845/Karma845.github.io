<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p class="calibre2">───Once upon a time, a baby was born.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His name was Zenovis, a son of an ordinary farmer, and grew up with all the love and affection of his parents.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the boy who was born into such an ordinary family was also the most out of the ordinary in the world of “Argena.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The first glimpse of his abnormality was seen when he was five years old.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The boy, who normally ran around in the fields and mountains like other children in the village, realized that he was alone, swinging a wooden stick in his hand.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Everyone thought that the child was just swinging a wooden stick around, yearning to be a knight.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But… the boy never got tired of swinging.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And a week after, the boy started swinging at targets.</p>
<p class="calibre2">To everyone’s surprise, he cut down a tree in the forest with just a wooden stick.</p>
<p class="calibre2">At first, no one thought the boy had actually cut down the tree. In the first place, it was impossible for a child to cut down a tree, and moreover, the cut on the tree was so smooth that it looked as if it had been cut by a sharp sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The boy had wielded a wooden stick and not a sword.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That is why the adults in the village tried to treat this incident as one of the strange happenings.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, when the trees in the forest continued to be cut down for two or three days from there, a commotion broke out in the village, saying that this was not a normal occurrence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So when the village adults tried to find out who was cutting down the trees, they found the boy going out to do his usual pretend play.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And when they followed the boy… the boy, with his wooden stick, cut down the mountain.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Amazingly, the boy had gotten tired of cutting down trees with the wooden stick and finally cut down the mountain in one fell swoop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The scene was so unrealistic that the boy came to be treated as an eerie presence in the village. However, the boy’s parents remained affectionate toward him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This had a positive effect on him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">They learned of the boy’s unusual talent and began to try to encourage him to do whatever he wanted to do as much as possible.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And when the boy showed interest in magic, they managed to save up enough money to buy him a tattered book about magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The book was not the kind of book a child would read, and its contents were so crude that it was hard to believe that the boy could learn to use magic from this one book.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the boy read the book, and after his own interpretation and research, he found himself becoming a great magician.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It would be a waste for the boy’s life to remain in this village.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His parents decided to enroll him in a famous magic school of the time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The parents, who lived in a rural village, could not afford the tuition fees, but the school had a system for special students, which allowed them to enter without paying any tuition fees if they achieved excellent results in the entrance examination.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The boy naturally became a special student and attended the magic school.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Moreover, not only in the entrance examination, but even after entering the school, the boy’s talent was demonstrated beyond measure, and he always maintained the top grades in his school year. His combat skills soon became the best in the school.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, even such a perfect boy was not very good at socializing with others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Because of an incident when he was five years old, he was never treated normally by anyone other than his parents, and because he was not a very outgoing person, he was always isolated at school.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, the boy himself did not regret his inability to socialize but instead began to explore all areas of life, always following his curiosity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He was interested in martial arts other than swordsmanship, and also studied weapons, armor, and other tools, as well as the arts, such as singing and painting.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It would take a lifetime to master a single art form for an ordinary person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If one seeks too much, one will end up only becoming half accomplished.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That was the norm.</p>
<p class="calibre2">──Except for him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">By the time the boy turned into a young man, he had mastered every field.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Swordsmanship, magic, blacksmithing, art. There was not a single thing he could not do.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even if he saw something unknown, he could learn it instantly and sublimate it into his own skill.</p>
<p class="calibre2">…Why was such a being born?</p>
<p class="calibre2">Even Argena, the planet on which the young man lives, doesn’t know.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is genuinely a heresy to humanity.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After graduating from magic school, there was nothing he could not already do, so he decided to travel around the world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In the course of his travels, he beat up a rampaging dragon, mastered all kinds of martial arts, acquired all the “Holy” titles, and defeated an “Evil” king all by himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If you think his stories are always so wild, he also rescued an exiled princess and fought alone against a country to fulfill a certain child’s wish.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The path he took was truly legendary.</p>
<p class="calibre2">His legend was spreading more and more.</p>
<p class="calibre2">And eventually… people began to call him “The Sage.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, no one knows about his later years.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There is nothing left in history except for the fact that there was a “Sage” who established such legends.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There are many speculations about his last days, such as that he was defeated by the gods, that he traveled to the end of the sky, and so on…</p>
<p class="calibre2">Many researchers have tried to predict his end based on the traces of “The Sage.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, as long as people believe he was an extraordinary being, they will never know his end.</p>
<p class="calibre2">He just wanted to die, as a person.</p>
<p class="calibre2">──No one would ever know that he wanted to be normal more than anyone else because he was more abnormal than anyone else.</p>

<p class="calibre2"><b class="calibre4">＊＊＊</b></p>

<p class="calibre2">This was when such a Sage was alive.</p>
<p class="calibre2">──<b class="calibre4">[Dragon Valley]</b>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Surrounded by steep mountains, the valley is inhabited by all kinds of dragon species. In this place, various dragon species are always fighting for territory, and ordinary monsters can not even set foot in the land.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is because the powerful magic waves emitted by the dragon species make it impossible for ordinary monsters to approach.</p>
<p class="calibre2">This is why the competition for food source is so fierce among the dragons in <b class="calibre4">[Dragon Valley]</b>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The level of danger is comparable to that of the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In contrast to the ecological struggle among a wide variety of monsters in the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b>, the struggle between dragons are different &ndash; they are few in number but can be considered the pinnacle of monsters, and are always fighting each other here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Dragons raised in this land boast overwhelming power compared to dragons that inhabit other lands.</p>
<p class="calibre2">If even one dragon were to wander out from this <b class="calibre4">[Dragon Valley]</b>, several countries would be destroyed in an instant.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, dragons do not leave the valley. This is because they were forbidden to leave the valley by a single dragon.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That dragon was quietly closing its eyes in the deepest part of the valley.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…..”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Sunset-colored scales and sharp claws. Its size was nothing compared to that of the “Genesis Dragon” that would later be named Ouma.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…This is as far as you go?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The sunset-colored dragon mutters quietly. Its voice sounded somewhat empty.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ve been watching over this world with him for many years, but… nothing has changed. Mankind is just corrupt.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Not meaning for anyone to hear, the dragon continues in a matter-of-fact tone.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Humanity is what causes harm. They claim this planet as their own and fight amongst themselves. They couldn’t break the negative chain of continuity they created…!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dragon’s eyes lit up with fury.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“They are the reason this planet is out of balance! To make this planet a peaceful place, humanity must perish!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The voice, spewed out with fury, shook the valley. Hearing the dragon’s voice, even the other dragon species, which normally fight over territory, gasped in fear.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I… must destroy mankind for the sake of this world, Argena! But…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dragon looked abhorrent as he paused in his speech.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…I cannot defeat him now. Even if I teamed up with “Evil,” it would be impossible. Then…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, a strange aura, different from magic power, rises from the dragon’s body.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Staring at that aura calmly, the dragon muttered quietly.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmmm… this is the power of those who live in the upper dimension…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The aura was not the power of this planet, nor was it the power of “Holy” or “Evil,” as Yuuya knew it.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s a shame to rain on the parade, but… it’s also a surefire way to save the planet.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The dragon quietly fired up his ambition and said to himself.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“More… I must familiarize my body with this power… and I’ll be sure to make <b class="calibre4">[The Sage]</b>──!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">For the sake of his own ambition, the giant dragon continued to build up his strength in the <b class="calibre4">[Dragon Valley]</b> in preparation for the coming time.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre2">Then, far in the future in the era in which Yuuya and the others live.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So this is the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b>…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The man, the founder of the evil cult, was staring at the forest spread out before him. Behind him, there is a line of followers of the evil cult who are accompanying him.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The reason they had visited the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b> was to search for Yuuya, who was said to be living here.</p>
<p class="calibre2">But…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Nu…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Facing the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b>, the founder was unable to take the first step.</p>
<p class="calibre2">There was a powerful presence wafting from the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b>.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Founder! Why are you standing still? The enemy is now within our reach!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Right! Come on, let’s get going!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“H-hey!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">A few believers, getting impatient with such a founder, step into the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b> without hesitation.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Immediately after, the founder tried to stop them, but… that did not succeed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Kah──.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was only a moment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The moment he stepped into the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b>, the upper body of one of the believers disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Blood spurted violently from the remaining lower half of his body, and collapsed lifelessly as it was.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Without knowing what had happened, the death of their companion caused the believer, who had also stepped into the land, to stop.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hey! Run away quickly!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The founder shouted frantically, but his thoughts were in vain as the body of another believer disappeared once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The believers, finally realizing that they had entered a terrible place here, screamed.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“U-uwaaaaahhhh!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“N-no! I don’t want to die──”</p>
<p class="calibre2">──From there, it was carnage.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The believers, who did not heed the founder’s warning and entered the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b>, died without understanding what was happening.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W-what happened…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">One of the believers, who just now witnessed the scene where his friends were killed in an instant, muttered to himself as if he were trying to squeeze it out.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then, the founder, with a grim expression on his face, pointed his finger.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…That’s it.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The founder pointed to a seemingly ordinary tree.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, they noticed that the vines hanging from the branches of the tree were stained reddish-black.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s an<b class="calibre4"> [Assassin Tree]</b>… an A class monster.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“S-such a monster…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…The monsters that inhabited this place never leave the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b>. This is because the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b> is an ideal place for monsters, a land full of magic power. However, living in such an ideal land requires strength. As a result, the monsters here have evolved in their own unique way, minimizing their appetites and sexual desires, and instead honed their ferocity and the desire to fight. And that <b class="calibre4">[Assassin Tree]</b> has also evolved to suit this land. The only saving grace is that they are few in number, but all the monsters that lost in this race for survival in this land and flee will fall prey to it… Listen, don’t forget that the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b> is overrun with such monsters.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ugh…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After the founder’s explanation, the believers are left to their own devices.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However──.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“O, believers! Do not be afraid! For the sake of the resurrection of our God, we must turn to the divine enemy that lies ahead! For the sake of our scattered brethren, we must press forward! Our future awaits us after we overcome this grueling ordeal!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The light in the eyes of the believers, who had been depressed by the situation, lit up once again.</p>
<p class="calibre2">The light was somewhat dark and fanatical.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Come on, let’s go! The divine enemy, Yuuya Tenjou, is right ahead!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ooooohhh!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The members of the evil cult raised a war cry and finally set foot in the <b class="calibre4">[Great Devil’s Nest]</b>.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre2">──Meanwhile, on Earth at that time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">A few days had passed since the fierce battle in space.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I… Yuuya Tenjou, after a busy trip, was finally able to enjoy a holiday.</p>
<p class="calibre2">In fact, there are still some evil beasts left to be defeated in the other world, but Iris-san and the others ordered me to take a rest before parting ways. I thought it would be better to help defeat the evil beasts, but Odis-san also expressed his desire to make up for his inability to participate in the fight against Avis.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Still… unlike previous summer vacations, there was really so much going on this time that it didn’t really feel like a vacation…</p>
<p class="calibre2">The only memories that I have of the summer vacation were of going to the beach with Kaori and the others and going to the summer festival with Miu-san. No, I also took Lexia-san and the others sightseeing around the Earth, does that count as having fun too…?</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t really feel like I was on vacation, but I was really happy to be able to play with my friends, unlike before.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, as if to relieve the fatigue of the past, I was lounging around the house with Night and the others.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“The summer vacation will be over in a little while.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Woof?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Night cocked his head curiously at my soliloquy.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It was less than a week before the end of summer vacation, but I had finished my homework as soon as the vacation started, so there was no need to rush to do anything.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, I should be preparing so that I don’t panic on the first day of school…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah! Right!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fugo!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Pi?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I remember something and suddenly raise my voice, and Akatsuki, who was lying down next to me, jumps up in surprise and gives me a reproachful look.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I-I’m sorry.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You’re making too much noise. What in the world is wrong with you?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I apologized to Akatsuki and the others, Ouma-san, who was also sleeping, asked me so with a sigh of absence.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, summer vacation is almost over, and I thought I should go call on Kagurazaka-san, who is still in the other world…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Yes, I need to call out to Kagurazaka-san, who still remained in the other world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I mean, I neglected to do that until now because of my sense of things, but… I-is it okay? Each school might have a different date for the end of summer vacation or something like that…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W-what should I do? N-no, I have to tell her anyway before worrying about it!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmph, so you’re off to the other world today?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Woof!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Fugo.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Pi!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Night and the others get up as soon as I speak and get ready to head off to the other world.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I should have said a few words to Yuti, but she was not there, as she was visiting a school friend’s house. I am relieved to see that she seems to be adjusting well to her school.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“For now, let’s go to the Regal Kingdom where Kagurazaka-san is!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I went through the <b class="calibre4">[Door To Another World]</b> and traveled to the Regal Kingdom by teleportation magic.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre2">“Now that we’re here, what are we supposed to do?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">We arrived safely in the Regal Kingdom, but when it came to meeting with Kagurazaka-san, I was troubled by the means.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since she was treated as an important guest in the Regal Kingdom, I knew that she would be at the royal castle, but I did not know whether I could go directly to the castle or not.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Last time I was with Lexia-san and the others, so there was no problem, but this time I was on my own.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Since there was no one to vouch for my status, I wondered if I would be able to enter the royal castle easily…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I hope one of the soldiers remembers me, but as expected…</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I was thinking about this, Ouma-san looked at me in dismay.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What, you didn’t think anything of it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ugh…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh well. You don’t have to worry about it that much. If anyone tries to interfere, we’ll just force our way in.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“We can’t do that!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">That may be true if that’s how Ouma-san perceives it, but as I said, I can’t do such a thing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I wandered around near the castle, thinking seriously about what I should do, I was unexpectedly approached by a voice.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…You, what are you doing?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh? …Kagurazaka-san!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The voice was, to my surprise, Kagurazaka-san, whom I had been looking for.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was surprised because I didn’t expect to see her so suddenly, and then, Kagurazaka-san continued with an air of disappointment.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“If you keep wandering around like that, people will think you’re suspicious, you know?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I was in such a hurry and had made no preparations that I was surely a suspicious person in the eyes of others. I really should have decided what to do better in advance…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, okay. So, what’s the matter?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, uh… summer vacation is about to end for my school, and I thought Kagurazaka-san’s school might be starting soon too…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kagurazaka-san was surprised by my words as if she had completely forgotten about school.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I-I had forgotten that… I was busy defeating evil beasts recently… but it would also cause me a lot of problems if I continued to stay here…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kagurazaka-san started to think about something on the spot but then turned her attention back to me.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“…Anyway, I understand. The summer vacation is over, so why don’t you go sightseeing in this country for the last time? I’ll show you around, okay?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh, you don’t mind?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Indeed, I had not done a single proper sightseeing tour during my visit to this Regal Kingdom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Fortunately, I met Kagurazaka-san here, and all I had to do was talk to Orghis-sama about her, so I had time.</p>
<p class="calibre2">So, even for me, sightseeing is wishful thinking…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No problem. I wanted to look around one last time too.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“W-well, then… please.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Thus, I was given a guided tour of Regal Kingdom by Kagurazaka-san.</p>
<p class="calibre2">When I started to look around the city, I found that it had not yet recovered from the damage caused by Avis and Quarro’s attack and was still in the process of reconstruction.</p>
<p class="calibre2">However, even in such a situation, the people of this country are working vigorously and energetically.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Welcome, welcome! We got some good meat in stock today!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“How about some of our products as souvenirs?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It’s so lively…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Right? When I lived here, the first thing I noticed was that everyone was more energetic than those on Earth. And… look over there.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Ah!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I looked to where Kagurazaka-san pointed, and there I saw people manipulating magic to build houses.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“This country is so closely related to magic and life that it is called a magical country, so it is interesting to see magic used in various places, isn’t it?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As Kagurazaka-san said, when I consciously looked around me, I found that people were using magic in their daily lives quite naturally.</p>
<p class="calibre2">I guess the people in the Alceria Kingdom use magic in their daily lives in the same way, but the people here seem to be using magic even more effectively than that.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Isn’t that one particularly amazing?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">There I saw a man floating several water balls with fish swimming in them.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“That seems to be the country’s freshest fish market. They magically turn the water into a fish tank to bring in the fish.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“A-amazing…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">The magic from the fish store owner was amazing, but the housewife-like figure who purchased the fish there also magically levitated a small ball of water and put the fish she bought in it to take home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I heard from Princess Layla that there is a lot of original magic in this country that is closely related to daily life.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Original Magic…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">According to Sage-san’s knowledge, magic does not require chanting or attributes as long as there is an image, but from my previous conversation with Layla-sama, there must be a lot of magic that has been created as unique magic, with some restrictions.</p>
<p class="calibre2">That said, some people cannot use the water attribute, and like the housewife I mentioned earlier, some people must not be able to buy fish alive and bring them home.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Well, from the looks of it, there might even be couriers who use magic.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We were also able to eat other meals unique to this country at a food stall and have Kagurazaka-san show us around the city in various ways.</p>
<p class="calibre2">Then…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oya, isn’t it Saint-sama! Eh… that handsome man, could he be Saint-sama’s lover?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, it’s not!”</p>

<img src="https://i.ibb.co/Bq8TCBR/000006.jpg" height="500" width="350"></img>

<p class="calibre2">“Saint-sama! We’ve got some live ones in today if you’d like to buy some!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’ll come back later to buy some more.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">People in the city who had noticed Kagurazaka-san approached her one after another.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Kagurazaka-san, you are very popular.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well… I really appreciate it. I wasn’t sure how it would go at first, but the people of this country have been so kind to me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Apparently, she has a good relationship with the people of the Regal Kingdom, which was a relief for me as well.</p>

<p style= "text-align:center;">＊＊＊</p>

<p class="calibre2">After some sightseeing, it’s about time to get going, so we decide to head for the castle.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Come to think of it, I didn’t have any particular appointment for a visit or anything, but is that okay…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, normally it would be impossible, but thankfully, this country treats me very well, and Orghis-sama said it was okay to speak to him without hesitation. Besides, I told him in advance that I would be returning to our world… and either way, I will still report to Orghis-sama, so please just come along with me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I followed Kagurazaka-san into the royal castle for the time being, and as Kagurazaka-san had said, the treatment was very good, and we were soon able to meet with Orghis-sama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After waiting for a while in what looked like a reception room, Orghis-sama arrived.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I apologize for keeping you waiting. And Yuuya-dono, it’s been a while. And all your friends too…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Hmph.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Y-yes! I’m sorry, I didn’t mean to bother you out of the blue…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What? Don’t worry about it. Yuuya-dono is a benefactor of our country, after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Orghis-sama smiles cheerfully as he says so.</p>
<p class="calibre2">It is true that I responded to the attack by Quarro and Avis, but when you even call me a benefactor, I feel indescribable…</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Speaking of which, Lexia-san and the others…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, they have already returned to the Alceria Kingdom. Thanks to the “Holy” including Mai-dono and Iris-dono, the damage caused by the evil beasts has been decreasing recently. After exchanging various information, they returned to their country.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I see…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While I was resting after returning from space, Iris-san and the others were working hard in the other world… Although Iris-san and Master Usagi told me that I could rest, I feel bad that I have done nothing so far.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After some light chit-chat, Orghis-sama asked.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So, what brings you here?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I am sorry, Your Majesty. May I ask for a moment of your time?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Mm?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">Kagurazaka-san’s words startled Orghis-sama.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“From the very beginning, Mai-dono has been helping us because of our selfishness. That is why we have no right to say anything to Mai-dono. And thanks to Yuuya-dono, the “Evil” king has been defeated, so there is nothing we want Mai-dono to do right now. Just what are you going to do with your time off?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, I was wondering if I could go back to my world for a while…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“What? Oh, yes… I heard that Yuuya-dono can go back and forth between worlds…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Y-yes. I can come and go. So, Kagurazaka-san and I can continue our lives in our original world…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">It seems that Orghis-sama already knows that I can freely come and go between this world and Earth, besides the fact that I am from another world. I wonder if Lexia-san or Kagurazaka-san taught him that?</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I understand the situation. As I said before, I summoned Mai-dono for our own reasons. As long as she can return to her world, there is no problem. The matter of the evil beast has settled down.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I’m sorry…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No need to apologize. We are the ones who are sorry for bringing two unrelated people into this mess. Since you are with Yuuya-dono, I’m sure it will be alright, but please be careful on your journey.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Thank you!”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After getting approval for Kagurazaka-san to return to Earth for the time being, I was taking a breather when Orghis-sama showed a sign of remembering something.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Right! I had one thing to tell Yuuya-dono.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Have you ever heard of the Evil cult, Yuuya-dono?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Evil cult… is it? I had never heard of it before.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">As I tilted my head at the unfamiliar word, Orghis-sama continued.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“To put it simply, it is a religion that believes in “Evil,” but some suspicious activities are happening among its followers. There is nothing serious going on, but I would like you to keep this in mind.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I-I understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">I didn’t know there were people who believed in “Evil”…</p>
<p class="calibre2">I don’t know what they are thinking, but I hope it doesn’t turn out to be too disturbing.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After we finished talking while thinking about this, Kagurazaka-san and I greeted Orghis-sama once again and left the royal capital of Regal Kingdom.</p>
<p class="calibre2">After walking for a while out of the city, Kagurazaka-san opened her mouth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“So, how long does it take to get to your house from here?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, it won’t take long since we will be returning home by magic.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“By magic?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">While Kagurazaka-san, who was unaware of the existence of teleportation magic, was surprised, I confirmed that there were no signs of people around us at first, then I activated the teleportation magic and returned to Sage-san’s house.</p>
<p class="calibre2">We then passed through the door and returned to the Earth.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Yes, we are back.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“I-it really only took a moment…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, I would appreciate it if you could keep the teleportation magic a secret.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Eh? Why?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“It seems that teleportation magic is considered legendary not only on Earth but also the other world, and there are a lot of problems if I can use it…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“No, your very existence is already outrageous, so why do you care about the legends now?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">W-well, that may be so, but it is better to be cautious.</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Well, that’s all right. If that’s the case, I’ll keep my mouth shut. I’d better hurry home and get ready for school…”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“Oh, excuse me! Shall I teleport you directly to the front of the shrine…?”</p>
<p class="calibre2">“You don’t have to go that far. I want to do some shopping on the way home… Anyway, thank you so much for always looking out for me.”</p>
<p class="calibre2">After saying this, Kagurazaka-san went straight back toward the shrine that was her home.</p></div>
