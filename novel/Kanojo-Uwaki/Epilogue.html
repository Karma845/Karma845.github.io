<h3>Epilogue</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I've got a drinking party tomorrow.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other end of the phone, Ayaka got confirmation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Late at night, a week after the exam fatigue drink, I suddenly received a phone call from Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was an abrupt invitation, and I was lost in "hmmm".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why the rush, why again?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I stop my hand searching for a box of cigarettes to smoke.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Come to think of it, Ayaka advised me to quit smoking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Natsuki didn't want to hear that I wanted to invite you. All the girls from the Christmas party are coming tomorrow, so I thought it would be a good idea.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I am deeply moved by his words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I didn't think that the connection would connect with each other so much from that blind date.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[What's the matter with you?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I just thought it wasn't all bad. Christmas season."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[What's that?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka reacted in a funny way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[That party was a failure for me as the organizer, so it wasn't a good memory. Well, if a guy who got to know four pretty girls bemoaned the Christmas season, it would be a riot.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Four?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There must have been three girls at the Christmas party, excluding Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I pondered who the other one was referring to, Ayaka said dismissively, "Have you forgotten?" I said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[You bumped into Santa.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, I see."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I didn't expect Ayaka's mention of Shinohara to come out of her mouth; it had completely slipped my mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indeed, it was also during the Christmas season that I got acquainted with Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was the Christmas season when I left Reina and walked in the shadows of the illuminations out of the emptiness of being single.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But when it was over, many new connections had been made.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">None of these are relationships that I would not have been able to build if she had been there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because I was alone then, I have the relationships I have now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thinking of this strangely warmed my heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I hope Christmas comes again."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka chuckled at the words that unintentionally overflowed from her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I'm glad you're over it.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...... Perhaps the Christmas party was also an invitation out of concern for me?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Such a thought popped into my head, but I decided not to ask.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't know if Ayaka is aware of this, but she is grateful for it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I ponder whether I should give him a gift as a thank you.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I never gave Ayaka any gifts, but she gave me a key case as a gift too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it is in return, Ayaka must be happy to accept it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I was thinking about this, Ayaka suddenly let out a bouncy voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Outside, look!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I do as I'm told and turn my gaze outward.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Outside, soft powdery snow fluttered in the sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Snow, which did not fall even at Christmas, envelops the entire city.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It has been a long time since I have seen snow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I opened the window, powdery snowflakes came in with a dry cold wind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'd like to see some illumination."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I get it!]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I peek out from the second floor of my studio and watch the snow illuminated by the streetlights.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Through the phone, Ayaka also heard the sound of a window opening.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's so cold!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka's mouth loosened involuntarily as she innocently flirted with him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sami na."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With the words, white breath rises into the night sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I hope the next Christmas comes soon.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought as I felt the cold wind on my skin, which did not ease even a little.</span></p>
