<h3>Chapter 9 &#8211; Drinking Party</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Many circles hold a drinking party after the test.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is also true for the outdoor club Ayaka belongs to, which is also very large.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The number of circles that rent out izakaya (Japanese-style pubs) in front of train stations to hold drinking parties is not that large.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My tension was unintentionally raised at the first large-group banquet since my freshman year of college.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The basketball circle I belong to, "start," has about 40 members in total. The number of people who participate in the drinking party is less than 10.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the other hand, Ayaka's outdoor circle is similar to what is called a "drinking circle," even though it is called an outdoor circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The circle originally has a large number of members, and the participation rate for drinking parties is very high. In spite of this, the number of members inevitably swells as outsiders like me are sometimes invited to join.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">According to Ayaka's contact, there are sixty people expected to attend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With that many people, it would be a challenge to collect money from each one of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I saw the curtain with the word "Kaguya" painted on it, I stepped over the threshold and entered the restaurant. This is the banquet hall for this evening.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We arrived ten minutes before the meeting time, but there were quite a few people gathered in the restaurant, and the interior was already bustling with activity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The table is divided into six with a dugout seating area, and the plates seem to have already been distributed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I take off my boots, put them in the shoe rack, and step into the tatami.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, here they come!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked in the direction of the light voice and saw Ayaka waving her hand in our direction.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I reply louder than usual so that I can be heard over the din, and head for Ayaka's seat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I was seated next to Ayaka, she held out one hand to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is there a high-five flirtation in this circle when they take their seats?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At any rate, I put my hands on top of hers, and Ayaka gives me a surprised look.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, what's going on?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, sorry. I thought you had that kind of groove."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't have a flirtatious attitude. I thought I'd hang your coat on a hanger for you since it was in the way."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What the hell, this is the one I'm embarrassed about."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He withdrew his hand and took off his coat. The palms that had been touching me were getting hotter now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka nodded and got up from her seat as I handed her the coat. There was a place to hang the clothes together a little further away, which may or may not have been thoughtful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yuta, you and Aya get along so well."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl in front of me spoke to me. She was a petite girl with brown hair in a mash bob.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her rounded eyes peek out from her large black-rimmed glasses.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And I recognized the girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Long time no see!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl who beams like that is one of the girls I met at a Christmas party and the only girl I talked to.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, long time no see. You remembered."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course not, it's only been a month or so. I don't remember things that well.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">See the moon in the moon.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought it was a beautiful name when I first heard it. It wasn't often that I felt beauty in a person's name, so I remember it well.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was surprised when I learned that Tsukimisato is read as Yamanashi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At the beginning of a blind date, he was told to "feel free to call me by my name," so he calls me Natsuki.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If they were originally called by their first name and asked to shift to their last name, the hurdle would be raised, but if they are called by their first name from the beginning, it doesn't matter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We had shared a meal together for only two hours, but in my mind, we were already friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I am aware that they are friends, but they are not really friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The word "yottomo" is said to have been coined from the greeting "yo" that is exchanged when passing each other on the street.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In my experience, only about 20% of the time, the invitation to "go out for karaoke again! I think that only about 20% of the time, the invitation to "go out for karaoke again!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although we are yotto-mates who even forget each other's names, it seems that Natsuki, sitting in front of me, clearly remembered my name.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I remembered hearing from Ayaka last night that she was pleased, and again wondered how the connection had connected from that blind date.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What kind of clubs are you in, Yuta? You're not an outdoorsman, are you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm in a basketball circle. Well, I only go when I feel like it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ghost?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not that far off."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He should have been spared from being treated as a ghost, as he showed his face just the other day. In addition to Todo, he has maintained some interaction with his seniors and probably has no problem with them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In order to play basketball comfortably, you have to be somewhat attentive to your relationships.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Come join us, you can join us on the way."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">By "our house," do you mean this outdoor circle?.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I shook my head, pretending to ponder, "Hmmm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'd like to get in, but it's too big. It would be hard to manage."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The words are strung together like a series of familiar social pleasantries.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I show up at my friends' clubs, I occasionally receive such invitations, but I can tell that they are not all serious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki was no exception, smiling lightly and saying, "I guess so," before handing me a pair of chopsticks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But I hear Aya will be the vice president of the circle next year. I can get in with connections, connections!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Haha, well, I'll think about it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Vice Representative.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka's may have been liked by her seniors and recommended by them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Natsuki, aren't you supposed to be a representative or something?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki blew up when he said that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll do it! I can't do it! Do I look like that kind of character?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">""I don't know your character. This is the second time we've met."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I want you to see it for yourself the first time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As they were chatting and laughing, Ayaka returned to her seat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Wearing a black sweater and necklace, Ayaka is gorgeous even in a tavern.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In one hand he holds a beer mug.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Excuse me while I talk friendly with you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He puts a beer poured in a big glass in front of me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked around and saw beer mugs flowing from one end of the long table to the next.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, I guess the first drink should be a beer."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I laugh, and Natsuki's mouth twitches.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I wonder if there is a rule that you have to start with beer. I don't like beer that much."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, not many girls like beer. Ayaka drinks quite a bit, though."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki pulled the mug to her side a little heavily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Surely this is annoying for people who don't like beer, I think, and Ayaka opens her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, that's it! My senior told me that he was just trying to be considerate."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, you care? Where?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka smiled at Natsuki, who looked as if to say, "I don't remember being cared for".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"When you become a member of society, you have drinks with your boss. If everyone ordered different menus, it would take a long time for everyone to get together, right? So, let's have the first round of drinks delivered at the same time so we can get started quickly. That's how the idea started."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Heh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, that makes sense if you ask me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While I am honestly impressed, Natsuki grumbles.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then why not just have a highball as your first drink?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At those words, both Ayaka and I nodded our heads at the same time and said, "That's for sure".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked down at my watch and saw that the time was just before 19:00.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked around and saw many of the circle members who came later sitting at the same long table, signaling that it was almost time for the banquet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Following Ayaka's gaze, she sees someone who looks like a representative holding up a beer mug.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I asked if that was the representative, Ayaka nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It naturally draws attention to that person.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, first of all, thank you all for your examinations!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as the representative speaks a word, the people around him or her say, "Good day!" and voices fly in and out of the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka also put one hand to her mouth and said, "Good work! and put her voice. The other hand is holding a beer mug.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Now, no matter how well you did on the exam, the results will be announced next month! Tonight's drink is a gathering to celebrate the beginning of the period of escape from reality that is about to begin."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Everyone is laughing and listening to the representative. I like the looseness of not being blamed for giggling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps in this circle, drinking is also a splendid circle activity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The color of their eyes is different from those of basketball clubs, where basketball is the main event and drinking parties are just an afterthought.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Everyone is waiting impatiently, beer mug in hand, for the representative to declare a toast.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Now, we third-year students will be retiring from the circle next month. As much as I'd like to lead the charge, I'll pass the gavel to the next representative."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The representative looked around, but the representative and the designated person did not get up. Rather than not getting up, it seemed as if he/she could not be found.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki, sitting in front of me, raised her hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mr. Tree! It looks like the next representative won't be here today!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, you said you were coming today!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The representative was deliberately surprised, then coughed and stood back up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then we'll just have to ask the incoming deputy to lead the charge! Aya, please!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka, sitting beside me, jumps.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Everyone does when they are suddenly nominated.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, it's me! Oh no, no, no, no, please represent me!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Ayaka waves her hand and tries to refuse, the circle members call out to her, "Aya-chan, I'll take care of it! and so on."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seems that the name "Aya-Chan" is commonly used in this circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And Ayaka stood up with reserve, unable to go against the consensus of the circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is obvious from the gesture that Ayaka is in full outgoing mode.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought it would be nice if I could at least cut loose in my own circle, but I guess that's too late for that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, then, ladies and gentlemen. With your permission, I would like to make a toast this time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka says, and the representative laughs, "Stiff, stiff, stiff! and the representative laughs.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Certainly, that language may be stiff for words uttered at a circle drinking party, but in front of this number of people, it is not unreasonable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, it seemed to be a joke of Ayaka's and she said "Sorry! she said".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked up at Ayaka standing next to me, admiring her familiarity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking at her from a position almost directly below me, I couldn't help but notice Ayaka's breasts. There was a definite bulge even through her black sweater, and I quickly removed my gaze.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I want to watch and feel guilty that I am betraying them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then everyone, please get your mugs ready!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At Ayaka's call, I raised my beer mug vigorously to shake off my evil thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thanks for the test! Cheers!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The words "Cheers" echoed through the tavern in unison.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Each mug of wine moves right and left on the table, clinking and clinking as the toast is made.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">First, he extends his jock to Natsuki in front of him, then to the strange girl sitting next to him, and then to the boy diagonally in front of him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I turn to my right to toast with Ayaka, who has finished her last greeting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There were still numerous mugs of everyone in front of Ayaka, some of whom had moved from neighboring tables to toast Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka handled them one by one with a harmonious expression, but eventually seemed to notice me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry about that, guys."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After saying this, he lowers the mug he had been holding up on the table once.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Cheers."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A mug is offered in front of you.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka was waiting for me, her mouth relaxed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I grinned at that and jingled my jock.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Cheers!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The party begins.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After most of the food has been placed on the table, everyone is free to move from one seat to another, each with a glass in hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka also sat next to me at first, but was called to another group and switched seats.</span></p><p></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjBDf_4lrV01XV-TmZaWQSoxARZbuhUQgCZY2lIAFOCm92Hl2OqwQES14ECBvTSDz1qm5lT3v4CBixUXs8x9Ty75JVopuOHr3YuqosYEGnZG1hR_FuTsJu12RvVXYMTm_iwJTRHf5Ztaj-d-0_1g2OUFF2M-HzC-Pu2AyHvnVBjz2cN_1SkqZJqw-1A/s800/00024.jpeg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEjBDf_4lrV01XV-TmZaWQSoxARZbuhUQgCZY2lIAFOCm92Hl2OqwQES14ECBvTSDz1qm5lT3v4CBixUXs8x9Ty75JVopuOHr3YuqosYEGnZG1hR_FuTsJu12RvVXYMTm_iwJTRHf5Ztaj-d-0_1g2OUFF2M-HzC-Pu2AyHvnVBjz2cN_1SkqZJqw-1A/s16000/00024.jpeg" /></a></div><p></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is quite natural to want to call a beautiful girl near your seat, but here and there, "Aya-chan! and "Ayaka-san! and "Ayaka-san!" were heard here and there, and the degree of affection was beyond my imagination.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A great woman.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even the scene that unfolds before her eyes now is probably the result of the relationships that Ayaka has cultivated through her own efforts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He may not have thought of it as an effort, but from my point of view, it had to be an effort.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So when I see Ayaka enjoying talking with the rest of the group, it makes me happy too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yuta, aren't you looking at Aya a little too much?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He fluttered his hand and I blinked my eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In front of me, Natsuki looks dissatisfied.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Did you see that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With that one word, I vaguely remembered that I had been to the bathroom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When alcohol is involved, the time it takes for others to come back from the bathroom seems awfully short.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can see why you would be so taken by her face."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki said as she shook her highball.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"In addition to having a beautiful face, I have a small face and beautiful skin. God is unfair to make a difference at birth."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I agree. Ayaka has a huge advantage."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The best way to do this is to have a good look at the pictures. In our circle, there are many pretty girls because face is also a factor in the selection process, and I think Aya is the best among them, just my personal opinion."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even when mixed in with the pretty girls, Ayaka certainly stands out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki's subjective view may not be entirely wrong.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">was also a standout among the group, as was Ayaka, I recall.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I consider myself nothing but lucky to be able to build a good rapport with such girls.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, the words that bothered me more than that were coming out of Natsuki's mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not sure I'd be scared of outdoor clubs. Outdoor clubs are scary."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I reacted by pulling back lightly, Natsuki laughed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki, who had earlier praised Ayaka, seems to be very popular with men, perhaps because she is drunk and her smile is friendly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking around carefully, the level of the girls is indeed high, as they are said to be in the face selection process.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Our circle is very popular. We get a lot of people from nearby women's colleges who want to join."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Heh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a short reply, Natsuki tilted her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't you like that kind of thing, Yuta?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wonder.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's not enough to show overt dislike, but to say I don't like it very much might be true.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't understand it myself. I hesitate to reply lightly with such a thought, so I digress and say, "Yuta is fine".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think you feel the same way as Yuta. I think Aya feels the same way as Yuta."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka is the vice president of this circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's why I avoided denying this circle without having my way with it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Most of the people who tried to join this circle were unaware of the actual situation," he said. Aya also found out about it later, and when she did, she made a blatantly disgusted face."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wow, that's unusual."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that unusual?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki looked at him curiously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was not unusual when he was with me. But I guess he didn't like that kind of attitude when he was with other people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The irony is that it was Aya who benefited the most.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki's ears are stained red, indicating that she is quite drunk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki's expression turned to one of shock as the words came out of her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, that was..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said, "Fine. You know, sometimes it seems that way."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka herself has a section that thinks it is inevitable to be told such things.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It might be a different story if it were said by a circle of friends with whom I shared a meal.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Partly because I felt that getting angry at a drinking party would not help, I let Natsuki's gaffe slide lightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But perhaps feeling uneasy about my attitude, Natsuki follows up with, "Aya-chan is a really good person, though.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I guess they are afraid that the gaffe will be passed on to Ayaka from me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I almost thought girls would have a hard time, but it might be the same for guys in this situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I won't tell. I'm not going to tell you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I said this, I wondered how Ayaka would have behaved under such circumstances.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If I say something behind your back, will you be angry for me?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If I say something behind your back, will you be angry for me?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki cuts in to change the subject.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I didn't try to mention it either, but nodded my head honestly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka again!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought so, but Natsuki seems genuinely interested.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I decided to answer honestly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No. Sometimes people ask me about it, but I've never gotten to know them that way. I've been asked occasionally, but we've never gotten to know each other that way."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, really? I'd be misunderstood if I had a girlfriend or something."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not here, so it won't matter."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then they might have misunderstood me when I was there."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You are going to have to go into a lot of detail.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm surprised because when we talked before, all we talked about was cartoons and other entertainment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This restaurant has great cartilage!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki didn't seem to want to continue that topic anymore and dressed my empty small plate with cartilage and hockey sticks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thank him, "Thanks," and pull my beer closer to me and start drinking again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I still have some left for myself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I drink both, so it's fine."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm a strong drinker, so it's not a problem. There is a man I don't know lying right next to me, but at least I am proud that I am not weak enough to go down in an hour like him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I drink a lot."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He says it in a surprising manner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If he also smokes, it is clear that he is not a man for everyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't know if the girls in this circle have such values, but in case they do, let's not smoke. I was dumbfounded by who I was trying to get to look at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My pants pocket trembled and I took out my phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The screen indicating an incoming call showed Shinohara's name.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai, what time are you coming home today? I'm in the neighborhood."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked down at my watch and saw that it was twenty o'clock. I was told that I could stay for about four hours, so I still have two hours to go.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['It's going to be the last train today, so go home.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I sent the message and received a reply in an instant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[What do you mean, "Go home! What is this?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I loosened my mouth involuntarily, Natsuki spotted me and asked me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's a girl."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You think so?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sure of it. I know what it is!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wanted to say, "What do you think you know?" but I was actually guessed, so it was frustrating that I couldn't say anything. Besides, if you think about it, it is bad manners to reply to someone when they are talking right in front of you.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, I was messing with my phone."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm? Don't worry, I don't mind that kind of thing!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Open-minded, indeed!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wahaha, praise, praise!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Natsuki playfully puffed out his chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then the phone rang again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought it was Shinohara, but apparently not.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The phone shows a screen indicating an incoming call.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ugh, hey, sorry, I'm calling. I'm going out."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh my God, you're so popular! Okay, it's time to change seats, but I'll wait here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, seriously. Thank you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is there such a thing as changing seats?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In a circle with a large number of people, that may be necessary if you want to socialize. The fact that Natsuki said he would not move his seat indicates that it is not mandatory either.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Nice salt-and-pepper drink.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With that in mind, I got up from my seat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After walking out of the pub, I checked my phone, which kept shaking, and it seemed that the number was not registered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But the number was somewhat familiar.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I picked up the phone, feeling a stirring in my chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hello, this is Hasegawa."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Hello, Yuta-kun]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I remember hearing that clear voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's what I hate to say.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The residue of memory stimulates the mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... Reina."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The caller was my ex-girlfriend, Reina Aisaka, whom I broke up with a few months ago.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do you want?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Far from the cheerful atmosphere of the tavern, a reivery voice emanates from his own mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There should be nothing for the two of them to talk about anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even when they met each other on a shopping spree accompanied by Ayaka, they must have parted without having a good talk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472; &#9472; "See you later," I had wondered about his parting words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Sorry to barge in on you?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not. It's been a long time since you called me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Yeah, I thought the line might be blocked.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indeed, at the beginning of the breakup, I thought about blocking it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, I stopped, thinking that I would never hear from him again and that it would be childish to go out of my way to block him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Now I think such a "break" may be necessary for a fresh start.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Were you busy just now?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rena makes such a confirmation, as if she can hear the buzzing of the tavern.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm going to a drinking party with my circle. If you have something to do, please make it quick."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There will be a short pause.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I listened absentmindedly to the hustle and bustle I could hear through the door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I said the last time we bumped into each other, but I was wondering if we could meet again. Like I said when we bumped into each other the other day, I was wondering if we could meet again.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472; &#9472; I thought it was a social call.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I swallow the words that are about to come out of my throat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm not looking for a fight.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I want to get the call done as amicably and quickly as possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, thanks."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Why?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Why? Why?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I never expected to be asked such a question.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I involuntarily stare at the screen of my phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You don't know unless you ask, this guy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Yuta-kun?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I honestly wasn't sure whether to hang up or not.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I am at a loss for an answer, the door behind me opens.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seems Ayaka came to check on me outside.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, there he is...he's on the phone. Sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I'm fine."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Girlfriend?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The question gave me some idea of what to expect.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Reena has probably already stepped past the affair in her mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe the question I just asked is also not altruistic, but just curious. It's all in the realm of the imagination, but that's what I thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I remain silent, Reina's questions continue.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Have you been busy lately?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I just go to the club once in a while."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I see. Same as ever.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We'd known each other long enough for such words to come out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I felt that if I did not break it off here, I would not be able to move on.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But when he speaks like this, the buzzing in his chest remains the same.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wrinkle my brow involuntarily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Why am I continuing to call when it should already be my unwillingness to think about Reina in this way?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Do you have something you want to tell us? Something you want to ask? Or do you just want to...?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't care what you do. Don't contact me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I half forced those words out of my throat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sounds coming from the tavern grow louder, as if in resonance with the tone of voice that comes out of the various emotions being stifled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I could hear Reina's slightly surprised breath in my ear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[..... so]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's a short reply for a pause.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You have no use for it anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I decided to do so and put my finger on the button to end the call. As if to cover up some emotion that had passed through my mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I was cutting away, I heard a voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I'm not cheating.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What did Rena say at the end?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I didn't cheat on you, it sounded like.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She was in front of my house, stringing hands with another man. I don't know if that's not cheating.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka speaks to me, looking puzzled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Now..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't ask."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't want to be bothered by the fact that they heard my conversation with Reina.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka would never know that the person she was calling was her ex-girlfriend, but it would at least be obvious from the side that she had a problem with someone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I am aware of having had that many conversations.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So ...... then, I won't ask."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I bite my lip, feeling irrationally angry at myself for making him care about me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka tapped me on the shoulder and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Go home and get some rest, or have a drink and blow off steam. If you go home, I'll pay for your share."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I look at Ayaka's face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was a gentle expression on his face, not an outgoing one.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll have a drink."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Frankly, I don't believe that alcohol can dissipate all of these feelings.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But right now, he did not want the time that Ayaka had made for him to be destroyed by Reina.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka turned up the corners of her mouth when she heard my response.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As we pass through the curtain and return to the tavern, the circle members' chatter becomes even louder.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just as some of the circle members were moving to change seats.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then I'll move to the seat next to you. You missed me, didn't you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't be silly, I was having a great time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know~."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Grinning, Ayaka walks to the seat she was in.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Ayaka holds the glass, the people in the seats say, "You're going away!" and a voice of lamentation rises from the people seated.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka, laughing and bailing, began to move to an empty seat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When we sit down, he and Natsuki turn around and wave to us.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm coming!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of the large number of people in this drinking party, the laughter never stops coming from the entire restaurant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Such hustle and bustle was very comfortable for me now.</span></p>
