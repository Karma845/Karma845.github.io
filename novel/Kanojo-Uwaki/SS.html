<h3>Short Story &#8211; Ranking of Requirements for a Matchmaker</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I pulled out a colorful magazine from under my bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The headline is a special feature on love.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course, I don't remember buying it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's funny that I have this stuff in my house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"My name is not Hey. My name is Mayu Shinohara."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara is reading a manga in a prone position with a cushion on his chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">They don't seem to notice the magazine I'm holding up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had no choice but to lightly tap Shinohara's buttocks with a magazine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not interested in you. What is it, senpai? I don't have that kind of taste..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"......, hi. What's up?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He must have guessed what I wanted to say, and this time he responds honestly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why is your stupid magazine lying under my bed? And it's covered in dust."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara opened his mouth as if miffed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's rude. It's not a trivial magazine, and its dusty appearance is evidence that you neglected to clean the house while I was here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll be right back. ......."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">An unexpected counterattack was decided by a body blow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm sure my laziness is a distant cause of the dusty mess.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But you know, if you don't put them under people's beds without permission, they don't get dusty. At least clean up after yourself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can't believe I'm being told by a senior to clean up after ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Where's the shock in that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was getting kind of silly to continue talking, so I decided to flip through the pages of the magazine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had thought that the magazine was just a summary of word-of-mouth on social networking services, but it turned out to be quite interesting, thanks in part to the skill of the writers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since I, as a man, feel that way, it makes sense that they are popular among women.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The article that particularly caught my attention was one of the headlines, "Ranking the Requirements for a Partner".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">First place: "Fast on his feet."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Second place: "Good at sports."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Third, "Gentle".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"School kids!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I couldn't help but to get caught up in the moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can only assume that the writer was joking around, but I wonder if this is also the result of responding to a need.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's that kind of mystery that makes this magazine so popular.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's a weird fad. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had thought that the answers would be so realistic that they would be summarized.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, do you have a specific kind of partner in mind?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Somewhat intrigued, I asked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I've watched TV shows featuring romance before, and maybe that much is obvious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara looked troubled for a while in response to my question, but then clapped his hands as if he had an epiphany.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm older!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, yeah."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of the many confessions I have received, the only one I have accepted is from an older man. This is not particularly surprising, since many women, not just Shinohara, like older men.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, Shinohara did not seem to like my reaction, so he came closer to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're older."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... heh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm older."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Get closer!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Finally, he closes the distance to the point where I can almost breathe on him, and I retreat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Haha, I'm so embarrassed!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had a hard time restraining my desire to throw the magazine at Shinohara, who jiggled his legs in a funny way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A man who is not embarrassed at such a close range would be crazy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I would like to hold the reins of this devilish junior a little tighter, I thought to myself.</span></p>
