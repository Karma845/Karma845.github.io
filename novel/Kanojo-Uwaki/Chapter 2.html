<h3>Chapter 2 &#8211;Christmas Party</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Christmas Day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was seated at a restaurant that Ayaka had reserved in advance, a place that was fashionable but rarely seen by couples.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But how did you find such a store? I thought that at this time of year, fashionable stores are usually occupied by couples."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although the luxury and atmosphere are not as good as yesterday's restaurant, this restaurant is still more suitable for me considering that the prices are relatively reasonable and the menu has many dishes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka, whether she knew it or not, gave a thumbs-up and grinned.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not going to surf the net, I'm going to go to the site. I'm the organizer, so I'm going to make sure everything is done right."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That part of you is solid."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I praised her honestly, but it seemed that Ayaka was not happy with her words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not usually firm when I say, "That's just the way I am. I am firm."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh. Then I have one question, okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Check across the table, facing each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What? No, no, no, no."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said, "Yeah. Why aren't the others coming?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I asked the question, Ayaka looked thrilled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, you. You've heard the taboo of this gathering."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her expression and theatrical tone are like that of an actress, with a face that all my friends say is beautiful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But the stage of getting excited about such faces had passed in high school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shut up. What do you mean there are no men, no women, no one but us?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The caller should have said firmly that it was a joint party.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I made a mistake with ......."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I gave them the wrong time! You're the only one who got the time an hour earlier!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka abandoned her theatrical tone in an instant and began to speak as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know it's my fault, but you should check your phone too. I've sent you several messages and you haven't even read them."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, seriously?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I checked, I found that I had received several lines around noon today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I'm sorry, I gave the wrong time. I'll meet you at 8:00 p.m.']</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[See you at 8:00 p.m.!]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[If you don't reply, I'll have to adjust my schedule accordingly.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[At least read me.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[All right! You just go!]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... really."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Basically I'm at home hanging out on video sites and such, so they didn't notice the line notification.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was also a disaster that I had put it on silent mode.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought to myself, "Why didn't you reply to me, but I guess you were probably just playing music because you were lonely living alone."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka makes a disgusted voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I didn't want to make you wait at the meeting place, so I came all the way here early."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, it was Ayaka who made the first mistake.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's like Ayaka, for better or worse, in that she follows up on her mistakes well.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I may at least thank them later.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Come to think of it, why did you let me in an hour before my appointment?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm still available at this time, so I've been very accommodating. I'll have to thank you when I pay the bill."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For the next forty minutes or so, we talked about nothing else until the members were all together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As much as it pains me, Ayaka is the person I feel most comfortable with among my friends. I can't tell her because she would make fun of me most of the time, but I thought it would be more fun for us to spend time together than at a blind date.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Chisssss!"  "Wiss!" "Hallo!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The male members of the party visited with the college student greeters three beats later.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The level of the face is indeed high, as Ayaka has chosen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If only they had a normal greeting, that would be a very high point.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Chisses and whisses, well, I get it, but what is a halo? If it's short for hello, it doesn't take much time to abbreviate, and besides, it's nighttime now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Good evening, everyone!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka greets him smilingly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I couldn't help but grin heartily at that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since high school, Ayaka has had many friends. Many people liked Ayaka, regardless of gender.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason for this is the current attitude and outward appearance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As we got to know each other, her usual hard-edged demeanor became apparent, but she seemed to be playing the role of a bland, energetic girl to the men gathered here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yaya, Ayaka! Thanks for calling me today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, thank you for coming on such short notice! I'm glad you're here, Motosaka-kun."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, if Ayaka-chan asks me to go with her, I'll go with her anywhere."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You won't get anything for saying that, will you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka was giggling, and knowing Ayaka as she usually is, I was almost giggling too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As the party began, the men and women talked a lot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was told that the group had been gathered suddenly because there was no time, but the guys were talkative and the girls were all pretty.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's hard not to get excited, even if it's about something else.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was me, too, and despite my initial reluctance, I somehow ended up enjoying myself for about an hour.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The men and women were facing each other, and the girl in front of me and I had the same taste in comic books, so we had a lot to talk about.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, only Motosaka, the man sitting in front of Ayaka, seemed to be concentrating on seducing Ayaka rather than talking to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, seriously, I want a girlfriend like Ayaka-chan."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Motosaka-kun, you're so cool, you can do it in no time!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know. Well, Ayaka is good, isn't she?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, no!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hahaha!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Motosaka bangs the desk with his hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I get it. This is a serious appeal disguised as a joke.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I haven't had much experience in love, but I've seen enough of the looks on the faces of the men who come on to Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka, too, says she wants a boyfriend, but she repels all attacks from men who seem to be frivolous.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And sadly, most of the men who are attracted by Ayaka's looks are of this type.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was not the case in high school, but it became more pronounced once I entered college.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I once wondered about the fact that despite being such a non-preferred type for Ayaka, she was still friendly as a friend, and asked her why she got along with everyone so well.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The answer is, "For now, we won't lose money."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From my point of view, I can't help but feel that there will be more trouble, but with Ayaka's specs, I wonder if she will be able to handle it before it develops into something troublesome.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't know, I haven't heard that much about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">......But then again, this Motosaka guy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as the party starts, they are gulping down their drinks and getting louder and louder.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Our group is becoming a bit conspicuous, in part because this restaurant is not a mass izakaya.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To top it all off, he started talking about vulgar topics to the girls, and as expected, Ayaka's temples twitched.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Motosaka-kun, you may be a little loud. Also, you shouldn't talk about such things with children you've only met for a short time. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, why? I'm speaking for all the guys here! I'm asking the girls what they want to ask me!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Motosaka, in his usual loud voice, refutes the idea. And when the guys are all together, I wonder if they think I've taken the lead on the bottom line.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The two other men look at each other and chuckle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Apparently, Motosaka's coarse behavior is solely his own problem.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're in trouble, girl."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I said this, Motosaka frowned as hard as he could.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's with all the flippancy?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I'm not talking about a flirtation or anything like that. It's just that the atmosphere is like this right now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's because you stopped talking, wasn't it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, of course not."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How can you be so sure?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Motosaka stared at me, not even trying to hide his grumpy voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"And, you know, the blind dates I've been to were like that, but this is normal, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing these words, Ayaka also opens her mouth to refute them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sure, there may be such a party, but ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was as if I could hear Ayaka's voice in my mind saying, "You should at least understand that this is not the atmosphere here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Motosaka, who is hopelessly perceptive, did not get the message. So, let's continue," he said, returning to the topic.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Up until now, the girls next to Ayaka had only laughed at Motosaka's stories as if they were in trouble all the time, but now their expressions were darker.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the looks of it, Ayaka has invited a friend with whom she has never tangled much.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But it was Ayaka who called Motosaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka seemed to know that, too, and this time she looked up with a determined expression on her face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, there he is, my senior!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The first person to cheerfully jump out of the door was Shinohara, a college student who had recently retired from Santa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Good evening, Hasegawa-senpai!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara approaches with a twinkle in her eye.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, who attracts the eyes of those around her with her outstanding appearance, stood out even more from the seats at this blind date party where all the cute girls were gathered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka, the only one who seems to be able to compete with Shinohara, now has an indescribable expression of surprise at the sudden visitor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was sitting at the end of the aisle, and I stood up, wondering why the timing of the event.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, man, what a coincidence."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai~, I haven't seen you since yesterday!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, who makes a sweet voice, looks a little different from yesterday.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't remember Shinohara being so sweet to me, and I'm sure he wasn't the kind of guy who would try to spoil me in public either.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">How on earth did they get there today when they didn't even let us know where they were located in the first place?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I was wondering this, an unexpected person opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, what are you doing, Mayu?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is a former hill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Motosaka, who had not been intimidated by me or Ayaka when we warned her about her behavior, turned pale when she saw Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Name calling and this impatience.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought I knew what their relationship was like.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as Shinohara recognized Motosaka, he sounded chilled, different from when he was talking to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, you know. Anyway, Mayu, why are you here?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't care why I'm here, do you? It was just a coincidence, Yudo-senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, who flies a guileless gaze, is also tremendously scary because of her usually cute face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara glanced at the girls' side of the table and let out a small breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You seem to be having a lot of fun again."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mayu, let me tell you something so you don't get the wrong idea. This was just a Christmas party for everyone."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, it's a party, isn't it? It doesn't look like much to me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, of course not. They've learned their lesson from the last time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Motosaka put his palm on Shinohara's head, but Shinohara waved it away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's a blind date."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I opened my mouth when I sensed their relationship.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Motosaka had said or done anything out of the ordinary, he would have remained silent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was in no mood to mention it now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You said so yourself. This is the same party you've been going to, where you're going to talk down to the girls, isn't it? What are you lying about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, you ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Motosaka stares at me with a ridiculous look on his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I pretended to be unaware of what was going on and stared back at him with a nonchalant expression on my face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Upon hearing my words, Shinohara shakes his head and makes a dumbfounded gesture.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I knew it. I am Yudou-senpai's girlfriend, after all, so please don't embarrass me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, it's not! It's his boring joke!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Motosaka clicked his tongue at me and turned to face Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Besides, what kind of relationship do you have with this guy, Mayu? You said you didn't have many guy friends!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you talking about, shelve yourself ...... and keep your voice down because you're annoying me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara puts his finger to his mouth, concerned about the eyes of those around him. Then Motosaka, who had not listened to us when we warned him, immediately shushed him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seems that what Shinohara said yesterday, "Even if he cheats on me, he still loves me," is true.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"And, about my relationship with Hasegawa-senpai. We just spent Christmas Eve together."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Buh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It blows my mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I opened my mouth to correct my wording, I was stopped by Shinohara's eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">They are saying, "Please, please, please match."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...... I'll have them buy you something to eat at a later date.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing about Eve, Motosaka drew more blood from his blue face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, no, that's ...... cheating, that's ...... cheating, you think it's okay for a woman to cheat on you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Can a man cheat on his wife?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But not women."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Motosaka let out a whisper of defiance. But by all accounts, it was clear who had the upper hand on the spot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There, Ayaka clapped her hands in a pan.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said, "Okay, let's break up here for today. Let's get together again when the time is right.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girls sitting next to me had glowing faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Apparently, Ayaka thought it was better to break up than to placate Motosaka and settle the situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I came because ...... Ayaka invited me, but I'm not a member of the group. Please call me again at a different time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Motosaka says, as if he is trying to be heard, and then proceeds to the cashier to pay for his own bill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was surprised that he still thinks Ayaka will ask him out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Let's go, Mayu."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Motosaka asked Shinohara to leave the restaurant, and surprisingly, Shinohara followed him with a two-fold reply.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I was leaving the restaurant, he waved to me and said, "Well, senpai, see you later.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I raised my hand discreetly, puzzled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was impressed by the way he wickedly shook off Motosaka's hand that tried to touch his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry guys, it's Christmas. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka looks unusually depressed while paying the bill.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Both men and women were following Ayaka with their mouths. I opened the door one step ahead of them, with them by my side.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sound of the bell, which was appropriate for Christmas, sounded quite lonely.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh my God! This really sucks!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the way home, Ayaka and I were walking together at night.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We broke up with everyone at the party at the station and everyone went back to their respective directions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, you learned something. "Well, you learn that if you take someone with you who's never had a drink before, sometimes you get guys like that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's why it's Christmas. ...... I don't know how to apologize to you guys."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You were all following Ayaka. They were having fun until she got like that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a shame that Motosaka interrupted me because I was having a lot of fun too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We only chit-chatted, but she was a very talkative girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If he was having fun, he would have asked if we could have an after-party after Motosaka was gone. I really screwed up this time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really? I could hear everyone rather well."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was so busy with Motosaka that I couldn't talk about anything else, so I naturally made it an environment for one-on-one conversations. Both sides of me were trying hard not to stop talking. ...... is my excuse, too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka let out a grand sigh and ruffled her hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He said, "Well, it looks like they had a good time at your place. They asked me to get your contact information."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was like, "Oh, really? Maybe it's because we have the same taste in comic books."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka nodded honestly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He said, "Since you know he's the kind of guy who spends Christmas Eve with other girls, I think he probably just wants to be friends with you in general. At least message him back."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After saying that much, Ayaka stopped as if she remembered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I mean, do you know Mr. Shinohara? Is she the Santa Claus that you spent Christmas Eve with?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, yeah. Santa is Shinohara."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was like, "Wow, what a coincidence. That girl is my junior."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, the question I had been feeling in thin air was answered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see, Ayaka told him where the restaurant was, and that's why Shinohara came."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"He asked me where I went to a party. I told Shinohara-san that I was friends with you at ....... He didn't seem too surprised. He didn't seem too surprised."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know. Maybe you just forgot."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was common for Ayaka to be known unilaterally to others through her self-serving introductions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka nodded, as if satisfied with the response.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We got to the road where we always part ways.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is a busy street, so there would be no need to send him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry about today. I'll make it up to you again."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't need it. Don't worry about it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not going to let you force me to go out with you. Do you want me to take you out on a date?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka suggested while twirling her black hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The white light from the street lamps shows off her beautiful black hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I swallow these impressions and exhale.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How self-conscious do you have to be to make up for that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That should make any normal boy happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka deliberately raised the corners of her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...... that seemed to be too much to ask for.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The difference in their expressions is easy for me to understand, since Ayaka is the one who usually teases me a lot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You say, "...... Well, what the heck. If a guy was so easily dominated by that, we wouldn't have gotten along so well. It's fun just to talk like this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Ayaka heard this, her big eyes fluttered.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7zMcsPs3xpXU9vc2Gmh8dScNs6OBUxKbdKemtcPScfe6tbjao5l2yOssueqN9svieqQicmMcqKmGOxp2C_Z2r99zCmvYKQH4LEkyHzE8VySX_GRgs8-2k2mMBEQXtbqfWs4t_FMwvvr1sRljAE8eDbwMtQKB69ofBJrNYTSneuW38SlYCKRvpKRXg/s800/00013.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEg7zMcsPs3xpXU9vc2Gmh8dScNs6OBUxKbdKemtcPScfe6tbjao5l2yOssueqN9svieqQicmMcqKmGOxp2C_Z2r99zCmvYKQH4LEkyHzE8VySX_GRgs8-2k2mMBEQXtbqfWs4t_FMwvvr1sRljAE8eDbwMtQKB69ofBJrNYTSneuW38SlYCKRvpKRXg/s16000/00013.jpeg" /></span></a></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"......, I see."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Under a street lamp, Ayaka looks up at the night sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The expression on his face is not the usual pasted-on smile, but a soft smile that he only shows when the two of us are together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka was even more beautiful than ever as she murmured, "Thank you.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I left Ayaka and returned home, I was greeted by my usual messy studio.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The time is still ten o'clock in the afternoon. Is it time for the couples of the world to get going?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I open a social networking site for the first time in a while, I see posts from high school and college friends on my timeline.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are a lot of things I'd like to tweak in this season's postings for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm going on a date with a Christmas outfit today! But I'm not confident at all!" If that's the case, I'd like to tell them not to post photos at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The post "The Christmas tree is really big! is a post that shows nothing but a two-shot, and I want to tell you to take a picture of the tree.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Usually I don't think about it, but I wonder if it's because it's Christmas that I feel that way today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I hate to admit it, but I still find myself envying the couple somewhere.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My heart is going to be devastated if I continue to look at the timeline.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I scroll through it one more time, somehow, before turning it off.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then one post caught my eye.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['I have a feeling today is going to be a great day...']</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The content was as bland as it could be anywhere.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That user icon was disgustingly familiar.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The person with light brown dyed hair is my ex-girlfriend. Her name is Reina Aisaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Reena cheated on me a month ago and we just broke up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although I was blown away in my own way, when I saw his face like this, I felt a stirring in my chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... tch."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There is no one else in the room, but they hold their tongues as if to hide their hurt feelings.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I could imagine many things just from the word "wonderful day" that Rena uttered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the time the one-year anniversary approached, there were signs that Reina's feelings were slipping away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At first, the frequency of returning lines gradually decreased.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Half the time I asked her out on dates, she turned me down, and eventually she even cancelled on me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Still, the occasional date was fun, and Rena posted on social media every time she went on a date, so she thought she could still get her feelings back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just then, he had an affair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... Ah, stop reminding me!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thinking about it doesn't help.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When you broke up with me and I was depressed for a long time, you decided that once you blew it, you wouldn't be a wuss.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If I keep going on like this, I have no face to match with Ayaka, who repeatedly encouraged me in an uncharacteristic manner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Stretch your body as much as you can, with the meaning of changing your mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It feels good to hear my back cracking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Whenever I feel bothered, the best thing I can do is to move my body in this way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...... Speaking of which.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is Shinohara back safe and sound?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yesterday Shinohara said something to the effect that he wanted to get even with me for cheating on him and then shake me off.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So that day was this Christmas as soon as possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It must have been pretty tough for that prideful Motosaka to get dumped on Christmas Day after a fight in front of everyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In addition, a couple's breakup is the most messy time of the year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The saying, "Don't leave a bird in the lurch" does not apply to couples.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is almost as if a mutually consensual breakup, with the two parties returning to being friends after a certain amount of time, is an unlikely scenario.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I found myself opening Shinohara's screen on line and pressing the call button. The ringing tone that should have been familiar to me now sounded inorganic.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then the screen went dark without Shinohara leaving.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's been almost an hour since we broke up, so I should have been home by now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have a bad feeling about this, but there is nothing I can do if I can't get in touch with him. I don't even know where Shinohara's house is located, and most of the time, my bad premonitions end up being just an imagination.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the morning, I am sure that I will have neatly forgotten about such a slight uneasiness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I give a big sigh and hit the switch to heat the bath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then a ring tone rang from my phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I picked up the phone, I heard Shinohara's voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hello, senpai?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, Shinohara. Good."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I let out a breath of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then I heard a giggle from the other end of the phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Did you call me all the way out of concern?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was just wondering if you could help me. Well, well,...... you know, he seemed like kind of a pain in the ass. They went on ahead of me, and I was just curious."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Haha, there's nothing to it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">They deny it with a cheerful tone of voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was actually just about to call you, too. I did a double-take when the call came from a senior."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Heh, that's a coincidence. What were you going to say?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I asked, Shinohara answered in an offended tone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'I wanted to apologize to ....... I'm sorry I got you into this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry for what happened today. I made the atmosphere bad. The seniors had nothing to do with it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, that's all right then. Even before Shinohara came, the atmosphere was terrible."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, I can even say that Shinohara's arrival saved my life. It would have been worse for me if he had just kept talking like that forever.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[But still, I was her, after all.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Did you end up breaking up with him?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Well, yes.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was a little concerned about the implied reply, but decided not to pursue the matter. If Shinohara wants to talk, he can talk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I think it's also a good idea to accept a confession of love in order to be a couple. If you trace this case back to the beginning, it's because I went out with him with that kind of feeling.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I decided to tell Shinohara, who looked a little depressed, what I had been feeling on a regular basis.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's just the way it is. Few couples are able to be completely in love from the beginning."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That ratio might have been higher in junior high and high school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If couples can only be formed from a mutual love, then probably more than half of the couples in the university are not ready.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We can be certain that there are numerous people among them who long for a couple's event and to go out with someone. Nevertheless, even though there are many people who think about it, it is hard to find those who say it out loud and clear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was honestly happy that Shinohara was sharing her heart with me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do you mean?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['No, I thought you were good at consoling people. I thought you would say, 'Yes, I'm sorry about the current situation, and I'm sorry about Shinohara too.']</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The atmosphere is like seeing something unexpected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You know very well that you are at fault, and you are telling me because you still can't sort out your feelings. What's the point in going out of your way to push back?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['...... hyah']</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara makes a dumb voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I'm a senior. ...... I guess that's what you call being an adult, isn't it? I respect you.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What? I don't like it when people say things like that out of the blue."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I don't respect people very much, you know? I look like this, but I don't respect people very much, you know?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think you're out of your mind if you think that someone who doesn't respect others would respect me. You should respect Ayaka more than me. You know her, don't you?'</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After only a moment's pause, Shinohara responded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['Are you Ayaka-senpai? Well, yes. I'll think about it.']</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After that, we talked about nothing else for about 30 minutes. There are not many people, with the exception of Ayaka, with whom I continue to talk even after my business is done.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">One particularly lively conversation was about a certain social networking site, and it was quite funny to talk about it with Shinohara, who had similar sensitivities to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['Phew, I need to take a bath soon.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, I'm off to bed too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Yes, I'll be back soon. Then good night, senpai. I'll make it up to you later.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['......Thank you for your time today.']</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With a thank you, the caller hangs up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When did the positions become reversed?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I found that irresistibly funny, and it made me chuckle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Besides, even if things with my boyfriend are settled for now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Maybe later."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I look out the window and bask in the dry winter air.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After the encounter, a new daily life begins.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Such a premonition seemed to brighten the familiar landscape.</span></p>
