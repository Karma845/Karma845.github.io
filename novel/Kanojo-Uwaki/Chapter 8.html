<h3>Chapter 8 &#8211; Telephone</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">When they arrived at the retro-style café, Shinohara sat in a café chair in the back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The black-brown café chairs creak lightly and make another slightly louder sound when I sit down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, who was hanging his coat on a hanger, looked a little tired, and I said something out of character.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll buy you a drink."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, I don't want it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Showing a puzzled expression, Shinohara refused.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I find it somewhat aggravating that he refused without seeming to think about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then I'll force myself to buy you a drink."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why? I mean, you said I would buy you a drink today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara even pretends to be slightly withdrawn.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it were me, I would spoil myself without thinking if someone offered to buy me a drink, but apparently Shinohara is different.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I've been bought drinks on Christmas Eve and stuff, so why not?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you trying to remember? I'm the one who sent it out."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That being said, I remember that I was hired to get back at Motosaka. It seems that my brain had falsified my memory on its own to preserve my dignity as an older man.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps it was the unconscious urge to buy him a drink that made him want to regain that lowly dignity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, it doesn't matter either way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're tired of suddenly joining the Circle and being the manager. It's labor, labor."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When he heard the word "labor," Shinohara looked convinced, saying, "Nah, I see. It seems that if there is a reason, they will honestly buy you a drink."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm sure you'll be very happy to hear that. But it was really a fulfilling time for me, and it was so cute to see my seniors enjoying playing basketball.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was happier when people said I was good looking."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In response to my reply, Shinohara said with a pout, "Eh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"When a girl tells a boy he's cute, it's a pretty good sign that he's cute."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, yes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is your reaction?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara yanked the menu list away from me with both hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I guess I should have put it away because I didn't think about the risk of ordering an expensive lunch because of our current exchange.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But that seemed to be an unfounded fear, as the meals delivered by the waitstaff were all wallet-friendly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I apologized to him just as he ate more than half of the meal, chatting with me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Sorry about something, did I bother your wallet?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I was in the mood for this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara nods and twirls his fork to bring the pasta to his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This junior usually has a cocky mouth, but he has this kind of caring attitude.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's probably why I don't mind the cocky way he usually talks to me, in fact, I even find it comforting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have known Shinohara for only about two months, but apparently I like our relationship.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was nostalgic today, though. It reminded me of when I was on the basketball team."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What? You were on the basketball team?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can't help but be a bit of a kook.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I think it was quite poor handling for that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You're thinking, "I'm good at that now, aren't I? I used to be really good at it!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara's face filled with frustration, as if to say, "That's upsetting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Even though I'm ......, I'm still a bit hazy compared to Ayaka-senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ayaka? She was once a member of a club?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What, you didn't know?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know, I mean ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In high school, Ayaka was a homecoming club member. She told me that she had also gone home in junior high school because she "didn't want to have less time to herself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had no doubts there, and even now, after hearing the facts from Shinohara, I am still half-convinced.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmmm. Ayaka-senpai, you haven't told me after all."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The cold expression Shinohara showed for a moment made me ask a question.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do you mean, "I knew it"?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's nothing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara showed no sign of concern and called out for the waiter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What I don't know, Shinohara knows, is Ayaka's past.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was tempted to ask, but kept my mouth shut as the waiter came over to my seat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll take your order."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Matcha-tea ore and cheesecake, please! Would you like anything, senpai?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The story has completely changed, or rather been changed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I am not certain what his intentions are there, but I do know that he has no intention of speaking here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, you can ask Ayaka herself about her past.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I gave up and decided to go along for the dessert.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll have an iced cafe au lait."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, sir."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The waiter bows lightly with a pecori and then turns his back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The uniforms are simple, but stylish in combination with the atmosphere of the restaurant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is easy to see why it is often chosen as a part-time job for female college students.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's more unusual for me to be working part-time as Santa."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Because Santa Claus is cute. It's very seasonal."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, who was also looking at the clerk's back, said in a charming tone of voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indeed, Shinohara stood out so much at that time that everyone took notice of her, especially since it was close to Christmas. It was hard to imagine a college student who would willingly wear a Santa costume as a part-time job, but who would become a café waitress.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, with Shinohara's appearance, she would look good in any outfit.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was surprised when I first found out. I was surprised when I first learned that, since senpai seem to drink black coffee."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is that a compliment? I don't feel bad about it because I too have an image of adults drinking black coffee.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But I can't. I can't drink it yet. It doesn't taste good."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I meant that they seem to drink tall there. Senpai is an adult, but he's surprisingly a child."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, who's the kid!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Contrary to expectations, it was not complimentary at all. Instead of praise, it was more like a put-down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry, but I don't have enough money in my wallet to pay to look good."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara seemed convinced by the answer and nodded, "If you don't have the money, could that be a choice?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is utterly disrespectful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, who says so, is dressed in a way that makes it seem as if he has plenty of money in his wallet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The beige trench coat on a hanger looks expensive, and the combination of a black high-neck and a thin necklace, exposed by taking off the coat, looks like they spent a lot of money.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"On the other hand, why do you have all that money?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although he was aware that it was a tactless question, Shinohara answered without a trace of disgust.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I work a lot of part-time," he said. I've been working a lot of part-time jobs, and I've had to work two jobs for Santa."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I guess so. Maybe I should work more shifts too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Speaking of me, I currently only work part-time once or twice a week.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">One or two shifts a week is a very small portion for a liberal arts college student who is not involved in club activities.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I was dating Rena Aisaka, I worked five shifts a week, which saved me a lot of money.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He was currently living off his savings, but that is about to run out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Shinohara looked disapproving of my hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll have more free time when my seniors don't come home."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You know, I think it's crazy for you to come home three or four times a week. Let him at least have a part-time job."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm also a salon model, so you can be lenient with me financially. I can at least pay for your food."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought about responding to the salon model or the temptation to become a pimp, but the words that came out of my mouth were questions about the former.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, the average college student has no connection to the term "salon model.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Can salon models make money?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It depends on the person, but for me it's about 40,000 a month. It's pretty good."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Nah..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Combined with my regular part-time job, that means I make many times more money than I do.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To be honest, my head was dizzy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But still, I was not inclined to ask them to pay for it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That is exactly the kind of trouble that would be caused if people found out about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">'No, thanks. There's nothing more pathetic than letting a younger girl serve it to you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, that's why I'm a senior."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I open my mouth with a sigh in response.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You tried ......, you're out of character!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ho, I didn't even think you'd take me seriously!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara puts his fork down on his plate and wipes his mouth with a napkin.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll make a special dinner for you tonight. I'll put my skills to the test."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I frowned at Shinohara, who was deliberately making a strong fist.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Apparently amused by the expression on his face, Shinohara blew up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So, what would you like to eat tonight?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When asked, I fold my arms involuntarily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The food at Shino Hara is of a pretty high standard, so honestly, anything goes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But that response is surely the most difficult for the cook to deal with.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So I told him the first thing that popped into my head."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tiramisu."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why dessert?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not saying no, but..." Shall we go shopping then?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With that said, Shinohara gets up from his seat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"you can go ahead and leave."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I understand. Thank you for the meal, senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara bows his head with a bow and leaves the restaurant first.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I paid, thinking about tiramisu.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After Shinohara left, I was washing dishes for two.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sweetness of the tiramisu still lingers on my lips.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The tiramisu for dessert was very good.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I like something moderately bitter, but with more sweetness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps she had figured this out from the menu I had ordered at the café earlier, but the tiramisu that Shinohara made was very much to my liking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Combined with the strange sense of immorality of eating in a heated room, it is definitely one of the best things I've eaten recently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The time now is twenty o'clock.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The day's arrangements proceeded more smoothly than usual, partly because Shinohara returned home early.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this rate, I'll have quite a bit of free time left before I go to bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Time with Shinohara was not bad, but I liked to spend time alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since it is the end of the test, after I finish washing these dishes, I want to lie down and surf video sites until I feel comfortable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a blissful time for me as I watched more and more interesting videos from the related videos.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But my modest desire to do so is blocked by the glowing green screen of my phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The name on the screen showing the call is Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[So, what do you think the customer said?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... Hey, can we talk about this some other time? I just remembered something urgent."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Well, you're surfing the net anyway. You can do that anytime you want.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You can call me anytime you want."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A loud sigh can be heard from the smartphone connected to the speaker.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[You're the only person I've ever had the displeasure of having to deal with when I call.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Reply with a sponge to remove dirt from the pressure cooker.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If anything, I was more conscious of getting dirty than talking with Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The pressure cooker that my parents gave me has seen very little use up until now, but since Shinohara has started coming to our house, the opportunities to use it have increased greatly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The pressure cooker must be very happy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I haven't finished washing the dishes yet. Sometimes I can't hear you over the sound of the water.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Almost there."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I'm not sure. I mean, aren't you washing dishes longer than usual?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My hand stopped for a moment at the sharp point.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is natural that it takes a long time to wash dishes for two people and even the utensils for making desserts, but I am afraid to tell Ayaka about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I've been accumulating this stuff because it's a hassle during ...... test week. Living at home, you have no idea how hard this is."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Don't be silly, I can do all the housework even during test week. I can even afford to go help out at your house if you want.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was grateful for that, but I wanted to avoid running into Shinohara as much as possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is better to do household chores alone than to be cared for at home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't need it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Yeah, I was really going to go for you.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Ayaka sounds bored.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Most men would rejoice in their hearts when Ayaka comes to their homes. However, Ayaka does not really get along with such men.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Therefore, it is inevitable that I, who am really close with Ayaka, would refuse here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472; &#9472; If they are really close, they should know a little more about Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Such a thought came to my mind unexpectedly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We were together from my freshman year of high school until the winter of my sophomore year of college.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I believe we have had a dense time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, an acquaintance of Ayaka's, Shinohara, told me that they were on the same basketball team in junior high school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There were plenty of times to say it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If there is so much that we don't know, it is more aptly described as hidden rather than unspoken.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course, that is not the only reason to doubt his friendship with Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't tell you everything about Reina either, and I know that it is difficult to tell each other everything, no matter how close we are.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Still, there was no denying that there was some loneliness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is a bit arrogant to say that there are many things I haven't said, but when it comes time for them to say something they haven't said, I miss them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A normal friend would have known this and would not have touched it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But the opponent is Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I decided to ask him boldly because I believe in his friendship with Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, Ayaka."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Hmm?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I heard you played basketball in middle school."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Stop the water flowing from the faucet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With the unnecessary noise gone, the silence returns to the one-room room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reply was not immediate.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't know what that time means to me, partly because it's over the phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Who told you that?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The tone of his voice was something I had never heard from Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is not an angry or quizzical voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...... fear, I guess.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sound of dripping water from the faucet echoes in my ears.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Am I wrong to ask ......?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I stand in front of my phone and look down at the screen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The icon of Ayaka was displayed on the screen, and it was a picture that must have been taken by the members of the circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka in the icon has a big smile on her face, but the tone of voice I hear seems far removed from such an expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[...... First of all, umm, no. It's not that it's bad.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is an unusually brusque reply for Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is he upset?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">One breath I hear over the phone can give some idea of the emotion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just as Ayaka understood me, I could at least guess Ayaka's feelings.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not knowing Ayaka's past does not change the years we have been together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Still, I was a little sad that I didn't know Ayaka. The question was born from those thoughts, but I shook my head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't want them to know because we are close.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I guess that's what they were hiding until now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Otherwise, there would not have been a situation where the middle school story would have fallen on deaf ears for about five years.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, if you don't want to tell me..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You don't have to say it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's what I would always say.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Trying to meddle too deeply in another person's life is just a nuisance if he or she doesn't want it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I know things that other people don't know, so it is comfortable for me to tell secrets to others. There are many people in the world who try to satisfy their need for approval by asking about other people's secrets with such a desire.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Some seek to get secrets out of a need for approval, while others genuinely want to be consulted out of affection.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A bright person can distinguish between the two.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka was in that intelligent category.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">During her high school years, Ayaka was prompted and asked for advice by boys on numerous occasions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka was sensitive to the ulterior motive of trying to get along with him and responded in a bland manner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I used to think to Ayaka, who was fiddling with her phone with a bored expression on her face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She is not going to be able to understand any pretense. To her, I was going to be myself, just as I am.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's not my intention to back down here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you have decided to be honest with Ayaka, the best option is to just ask her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you don't want to say it, then what?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'd like you to say it, even if you don't want me to. I wish you'd say it, even if you don't want to, I do."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[......, you idiot.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After saying this, Ayaka seemed to have closed her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The silence is not heavy, more like the usual atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Judging the atmosphere to be acceptable, I'll put my words together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;"All I've heard is that you played basketball. What was it like?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't want to mention that I heard it from Shinohara, just in case.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even more so, since the two are not the most flattering of friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I won't talk about it now, but I will when I get the chance.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, that's the guy who won't talk."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I'll tell you.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I shut my mouth at the words that instantly came back to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka exhaled and said slowly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I'll tell you, just wait and don't say anything.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... I got it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The strong tone of his voice seemed to reflect his intention to bring this matter to an end.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But once I asked Ayaka, I was able to remove the perception that I should not ask her about her middle school days.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course, I would not ask her indiscriminately, but I probably lied when I said that I would tell her when the opportunity arose.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A better choice then would be to sit and wait.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wasn't in a hurry. I was satisfied with Ayaka's promise to tell me something that she had never revealed before.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We are not dating, just friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If the question is answered, "Why should I tell you?" I am happy because the relationship is ambiguous up to that point.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was as if being promised was being told that I was at least closer than a normal friend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The phone's screen flashes to indicate that the battery is getting low.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka seemed to be in no mood for chit-chatting, and I could hear her working on something.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why did you suddenly decide to ask?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With the sound of things being put away, the question is posed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Of course it was because I was curious."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[... yes. Good. I was wondering what I would do if someone said something like, "I'm here for your sake," or something like that.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not going to say it. I know you don't like that kind of language, and I'm only going to speak honestly from now on."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are probably plenty of girls who like words that make their backs itch. Of course, it would have to come from someone close to them, but Ayaka is not even an example of that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Care is necessary. However, if it is not born from the true heart, it is meaningless to Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As for Ayaka herself, she is always carefree in her care, words, and deeds.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although there is a slight feeling of wanting to pout and say, "Don't put yourself on the shelf and demand it of others," I am more inclined to agree with him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because of his own false attitude, he would like his close partner to be just as he is.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I like that about you.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... oh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Straightforward words made me flinch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps bothered by his reaction, Ayaka corrected him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Oh, as a person. I know you know that.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know, so don't tell me every time, it kind of pisses me off. I mean, you're the reason why guys confess their feelings to me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When a friend of the opposite sex says these words to me, I know it, but I can't help but be somewhat conscious of it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wonder if the male friends who liked Ayaka up to now were dropped by these open and honest words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I'm only talking to you.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Hmm]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I'm not so vicious as to say this to anyone.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...... Indeed, though I don't think Ayaka, who basically refuses to confess, would go out of her way to bring someone down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then why did you tell me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[...... Come on. Just in the mood?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka clears her throat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps he was embarrassed out of character.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Well, I'll see you tomorrow for a drink.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know anybody but you. I don't know anyone besides you. I'll be fine when I'm sober, but until then, stay with me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I would attend the drinking party, but I was an outsider. It was awkward for me to join the table while I was still in my element.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Ayaka said, 'No need".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I know people who know people. The girls who came to the Christmas party last year are all from my circle. Tomorrow, the girl you exchanged contact information with will be there.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not sure if you remember me. We just had dinner, remember?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I remember, I remember. I was so happy when I heard you were coming.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, we have hardly had a line or seen each other since then, but it makes us happy to hear it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Well, you should look forward to it. I'm sure you'll have a good time.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, I'm looking forward to it. See you tomorrow."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Good night!]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In her usual cheerful voice, Ayaka hung up the phone.</span></p>
