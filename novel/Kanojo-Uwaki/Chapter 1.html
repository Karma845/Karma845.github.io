<h3>Chapter 1 &#8211; Meeting with Santa</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Illuminations lit up all over the city make us feel that this is the Christmas season, even if we don't want to be reminded of it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I let out an involuntary sigh as I looked across at the glimmering red, green, and gold lights.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are couples everywhere. I curse myself for inadvertently passing by a place that is famous for attracting couples.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although he declined Ayaka's invitation, his feelings were shaken when he finally saw the couple.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Occasionally, when I see a group composed entirely of men and my heart leaps with a sense of familiarity, I am discouraged to hear the conversation, "She seems to like the French course, so I'll go down there next time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He had spent last Christmas with his girlfriend, and he was a shoulder to lean on in the city that floats around at Christmas time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Excuse me, um, I'll take care of this for you!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the midst of this hustle and bustle, a girl dressed in red suddenly thrust a flyer at my chest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It would be a bitter excuse to say it was because the area was full of couples and they were getting on my nerves.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I reflexively brushed his arm away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Kya!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl lost her balance and scattered the flyers she was carrying around.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Whoa, sorry!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In his haste to pick up the scattered flyers, a group of students walked by at an inopportune moment and half of them were trampled through.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry. I'm really sorry. I'll pay for it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He had no idea how much money the flyer would cost, but he hurriedly pulled out his wallet, which he kept in his back pocket.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing this, the girl in red looked flustered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The red outfit was apparently a Santa suit, and I thought to myself that part-time work is hard work. Indeed, I was talking with Ayaka earlier about whether Santa Claus would come, but it turned out to be a terrible encounter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, it's okay! I'm sorry too for pushing flyers on you out of the blue. I'll explain the situation upstairs after I've handed out the unsoiled ones. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll go with you. I have to explain."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I look up to give him the flyer for the pickup.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl seems puzzled and hesitates at my suggestion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And I was all about something different.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She is outstandingly cute. Combined with her Santa outfit, she appears to float above her surroundings as if she were a resident from a different world.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This perception is probably not wrong, as people on the street glance at the girls sideways.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Judging from her softly curled dark hair and light makeup, she must be a college student like me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing my reflection in their big eyes, they run away to pick up the flyer without a second thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you for picking me up."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no. I'm the one who's sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm honestly grateful for the help, though, since the top is so tight right now." But I'm not sure if it's really a good idea. We still have an hour or so before it goes up. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The girl dressed as Santa bowed her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll see you later at ....... I wish I could tell you where you can rest."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, that's okay. The university is right around the corner and it's like a garden. I'll be waiting for you at a café called Ritters on the ground floor of the shopping mall right there."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that the college right next door?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There is only one college on the side in the area.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When he nodded, I felt a slight tinge of familiarity develop in his previously bland expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, my name is Mayu Shinohara."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yuta Hasegawa. ......See you then."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, yes. I understand. Retards, yes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a slightly awkward greeting, in contrast to Ayaka's, I turn my attention to a shopping mall where couples are gathering.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I gazed at the colorfully studded Christmas-colored decorations, I felt myself strangely light on my feet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're late."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ritters, a café on the ground floor of a shopping mall all decked out for Christmas.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I sat at the counter, alone, waiting for the girl who was dressed as Santa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I roll up my sleeves and check the time on my watch. Forty minutes have passed since the appointed time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, it's not surprising when you think about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The only thing I could do to excuse myself was to apologize with them. I was so nervous that I pulled out my wallet, but there are not many companies that would charge money for scattering flyers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I took one last look at my watch and sat up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I leave the restaurant after drinking all of the coffee, which has completely cooled down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I walk with heavy steps through the bustling shopping mall.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What's an apology together if you think about it calmly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He must have been alarmed by his behavior, which was like a new kind of pick-up. If I were in the opposite situation, I would have thought, "What the hell is this guy?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a wait-and-see approach, but I'm not sure it's a good idea to have a wait-and-see approach.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I was thinking this, I looked ahead and saw a couple walking right in front of me, holding hands. They were looking at each other and didn't notice me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As a result, I ended up tearing the couple's mated hands apart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Excuse me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He bows his head with a bow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The couple, probably in high school, didn't turn around, but instead romantically linked their hands, which had been ripped apart by me, back together again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... haha"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I let out a sigh. I sigh, not out of anger, but out of pity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That high school student will probably spend Christmas together. I wonder if they will make reservations at a fancy restaurant even though they don't have much money.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Put your hands in the pockets of your jeans and put earphones in your ears. I turn up the volume of my favorite music to block out the talking around me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is not hard for me to be alone, but I wonder why Christmas is so unfriendly to singles.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Let's go home and read some comic books today. That'll do for Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then he tapped me on the shoulder with a thump.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I turn around and see a strange girl. Not, the girl who was dressed as Santa earlier.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She is now dressed in a beige coat. It was hard to tell when he was dressed as Santa, but looking at him again, I can sense that he must be younger than me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, um, I'm the guy from earlier. I'm the one who just came in."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry, I was about to leave when I thought you weren't coming. Now?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I ask, looking away, feeling guilty that I was away from the place I said I would wait for them. Maybe I should have waited a little longer, no matter how much the other person was forty minutes late.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I've already finished."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"In two ways."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Etto."&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I quit."</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7MX81nbg8g7d1ZN6MyQHnNQiyqbIAjLttWBVtEeMC9zhPJuGqBmgNyfHsZVP61FeS0QC8zv3g0r5U4I_UG0Pbx803q-r_zzUKSPgsUL1KrI1HqiK7WiaSJP1-k0MAE-xUNzQpX_amYCdEjb9nUSjXw5KsoiQ4zfRnzHKBBone8ojr3Hb32IXHIcoE/s800/00011.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEh7MX81nbg8g7d1ZN6MyQHnNQiyqbIAjLttWBVtEeMC9zhPJuGqBmgNyfHsZVP61FeS0QC8zv3g0r5U4I_UG0Pbx803q-r_zzUKSPgsUL1KrI1HqiK7WiaSJP1-k0MAE-xUNzQpX_amYCdEjb9nUSjXw5KsoiQ4zfRnzHKBBone8ojr3Hb32IXHIcoE/s16000/00011.jpeg" /></span></a></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I flinch at the girl who casually smiles and says, "I quit being Santa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, something. Because I bumped into him that time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was going to quit either way," he said. Well, I'm a little sad that I can't dress up as Santa anymore."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, you're okay with that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And," the girl quipped. The polite impression I had just had was for a part-time job, it seemed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I told you my name, didn't I? It's Mayu Shinohara, not you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry. I don't know if it's okay to go to ......, but I gave my name so easily to this stranger."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We bumped into each other on the street and just scattered flyers around. That's what I thought and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's with that? You make it sound like I'm a lightweight."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, no, I didn't mean it like that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara's eyes narrowed, and he hurriedly waved both hands to deny it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're right though ......, sorry. I was just worried, but either way it was none of my business."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I apologized, Shinohara's eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, ...... I didn't mean it that way either. Please don't apologize so much, I was just joking."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What, are you kidding?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, I'm kidding."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wow, that's a hard to understand joke. ...... I thought I really pissed you off."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't have a temper like that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara furrowed his brow as if to say, "That's an outrage.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I responded with a wry smile, thinking there was no way I could know that at our first meeting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And Mr. Hasegawa, we are in the same university. And by the way, I'm in my first year, so I'm probably younger than you.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, you're Shinohara, too? I'm a sophomore there."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, there's only one college right next door here. If you are older than me, please call me by my name. It makes me itchy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara said this with a frown.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Indeed, the only time I get called "san" by older students is when I'm working part-time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You may feel uncomfortable with "san" in a private setting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, Shinohara. "Then, Shinohara, is there anything you can do to apologize? Even though you originally intended to quit, it's still true that I was the reason you quit today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing this, Shinohara crossed his arms and made a thinking gesture. He deliberately groaned, "Hmmm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Do you have plans tomorrow?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I have a place I want to go."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After saying this, Shinohara took out his phone and began to operate it. After about ten seconds, he held up the screen so that we could see it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's a pretty good store. I'm confident."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... No, this is..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is it my imagination that it says 8,000 yen per person for a French Christmas course?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why ......?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why is that? Well, you know. It's just a matter of being friends with the same university."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Appropriate, huh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's appropriate. It's better to live life in a more or less appropriate way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I lied. As senpai himself said earlier, this is a sign of apology, isn't it? It's okay to be that selfish."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ugh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That being said, I'm weak. It was indeed me who offered to apologize a few seconds ago. If I refuse the proposal, it's not an apology.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I think I just saw something at ...... where there was a line of words that I'm curious about.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's seniority?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It has been about two years since I entered the university, and it is rare for me to be called a senior by younger students in the university unless I am in a club.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since the circle would be addressed by "san," I myself hadn't been called a senior since high school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry, it's just a habit. I was in club activities until recently, so I tend to call older people "senpai" (senior)."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Heh, is that what it's like to be in a club?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, maybe not too many. ...... If not, I'll just call them up as usual."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I am somewhat embarrassed to be called a senior because it reminds me of the old days, but that's all. It doesn't seem to be a reason to reject it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Call me what you want."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay, senior. Let's exchange lines, shall we? After all, we've decided on that restaurant, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, yeah. Okay."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's all up to you now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Take out your cell phone and exchange ID.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since I was the one who brought up the subject of apology, I just have to follow Shinohara's lead here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thus I made a dinner appointment with Mayu Shinohara, now a former Santa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had a hard time letting go of the thought that the Christmas course, at 8,000 yen per person, would end up costing me a fortune.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm home."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When he arrives home, he greets no one, not that anyone responds to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is the moment when I feel lonely, living alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although the university and my parents' house are not far apart, I longed to live alone and asked my parents for help.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wanted to invite my friends over to my house to have fun, but for me, living alone had more disadvantages.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is very hard, especially when there is no rice served.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I hung my favorite jumper on a hanger and tossed my phone onto a pile of laundry on the carpet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The moment the phone turns on. New messages.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I looked into the face at the color I was expressing, I received a line from Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[We're having a Christmas get-together, you should come.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"At Christmas, huh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can't help but respond aloud.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tomorrow is Christmas Eve.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's a very sudden invitation, but I have an appointment with Shinohara tomorrow, and above all, I'm not sure I want to leave my house on both Christmas Eve and Christmas Day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I can't. I've got plans.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Sent.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, two seconds later, a screen appeared showing an incoming call. Sure enough, the name says Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I'm the one who said, "Lie!]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Lies?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, Ayaka doesn't seem to have the slightest idea that I can make plans.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is all the more annoying that he would have been right if he hadn't actually met Santa.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[We don't have enough people. Here, I'll lower my head, just like that.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I can't see."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Apparently, the number of men and women at the party does not match.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is rare that the broad-faced Ayaka is in such a hurry to gather the number of people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Ayaka had made a single cry, there would have been plenty of people who would have come up to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I mean, leave the number of men to the men's side, why are you moving again?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[This time I'm going to introduce some of my best male friends to my friends.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah, selective."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[You've won a prize there! Congratulations!]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I gotta go."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Sorry, sorry, wait!]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Ayaka's panicked voice, she seems to be in quite a tight spot.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What the hell! First of all, with your selection, I'd just float away."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I like you a lot. I like you a lot.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He says so in a kyotone voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, hey. What, did you hit your head or something?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Oh, you're so shy, so shy. So, what are your plans? Are you sure you're not lying?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He bites his lip at being so easily swayed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was invited by ...... santa."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">["Huh, Santa?"]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What are you talking about?" he said in a tone of voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"To a younger man dressed as Santa. Well, I've been through a lot."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From there, I will explain what I just said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Ayaka heard the details of the incident, she grunted and then made a quizzical sound.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I'm sure you've been duped by .......]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think so. I think so."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[You're the one who arranged the rendezvous just by scattering flyers, and you're the one who's the king of picking up girls.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, wait a minute, I've never picked up a girl before."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I protested that I was not listening, but he brushed me off, saying, "Don't interrupt me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I think it's wrong to say something that could be interrupted.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[So, you know, I think that girl who asks out an older guy she's never met before is even worse. Another guy comes over to where you're dating and asks you for money or ......]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I thought to myself, "What a beauty pageant. You're right, it's not."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I don't know. I don't know, but I'm glad. I know the appointed day is tomorrow's Christmas Eve.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['Well, I'll see you the day after tomorrow at 6 p.m. in front of the usual station. Bye.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked at the screen of my phone, which was buzzed off, in dismay.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He's been a brat since high school, but lately he's been treating me more and more like a jerk, hasn't he?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you for your patience."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Christmas Eve, the day of the appointment with Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, a former Santa Claus, appeared right on time for the meeting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, yes. Perfect, I'm not waiting."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was actually going to take another earlier train, but there were so many people on ...... that I missed it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I nodded in agreement. It seemed as if there were twice as many couples on the train as usual, if not more.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shall we go?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He said he would show me around, so I followed behind him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The boyfriends of couples on the street are glancing at Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara was mindlessly more enthusiastic in her makeup than yesterday, and nowhere near as young as her age.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was also unwillingly feeling a surge of excitement at the sight of the cute Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We duck under the elevated railway tracks and exit onto a street slightly off the main street, which is full of couples.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While not exactly deserted, the number of people was noticeably fewer than earlier.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unlike the main street, which is lined with ten-story or even taller buildings, many of the buildings are two-story.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">All of them were decorated in Christmas colors, and at a glance it was clear that many of the stores were frequented by couples.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Here we are."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara pointed not to a two-story building but to a staircase leading to the basement.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing them go on without looking back at us, I remember what Ayaka advised me yesterday.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">?" What's wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara stopped midway through and gave a kyotonous look.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, it's nothing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I shook Ayaka's advice out of my head and went down the stairs too. There was a thick door, and Shinohara put her hand on the doorknob.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At first glance I could tell it looked heavy, so I pulled him from behind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shalalan.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A sound that goes well with Christmas greeted us the moment we opened the door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I involuntarily straighten my back when the shopkeeper gives me a condescending bow, something I rarely see in chain restaurants.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm Shinohara with an appointment starting at 18:30."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing Shinohara's words, the shopkeeper bowed once more and walked to the back of the store.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The restaurant is dimly lit, and there is not a single seat in the restaurant that can be seen from the hallway. All the seats are private rooms separated by doors.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The room we were shown was a sofa seat where two people were seated next to each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The glasses are already prepared on the table.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is obviously ......</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's kind of a couples-only thing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's because it's the Christmas course."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a quick word, Shinohara takes a seat in the back of the room. With a glance, he urges me to sit down as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Let's see."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is supposed to be an apology, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... it was. My bad."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That one word reminds me that this is something I started to say.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter how much we had just met yesterday, it was hard not to be conscious of being brought to a restaurant like this out of the blue, but let's try to remain a little calm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You can order drinks whenever you like. You can order drinks as you like."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara then presented the drink menu. All of the drinks were about three times the price of those at izakaya (Japanese-style pubs), so we had to consult with our wallets before placing an order.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Seriously, this place only charges 8,000 yen for a course?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's right. It's called a hole in the ground."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara huffed and puffed, and said he was good at it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Good, then. ...... so why did you want to bring me here again?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You've been very kind to listen to me!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara's eyes lit up as if she had been waiting for my question, and it seemed that there was a reason why she was not a beauty pageant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">'Me! My boyfriend cheated on me last week!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara sniffs loudly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He then brought the aperitif to his mouth even though it had not yet been poured into his glass.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, there's nothing in there."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, you should have known when you picked it up."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He makes a sound of dismay.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I mean, you're underage. Don't drink the aperitif when it's poured."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't be so hard on me. You're not one of those who drank at the party, are you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara's mouth twitches as she sets down her glass.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Alcoholic beverages are often ignored at welcome parties for new students, or newcomers for short.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is not the result of the current generation's excitement, but a bad tradition from the past.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said, "No, of course not. I politely declined."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara smirks with narrowed eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her expression is reminiscent of a little devil, and it seems that it would take more than one or two men to be groped by her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From there, another conversation ensued about being at the same university, and it was about time for the next main dish when Shinohara huffed and stopped talking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was thinking of something I said that was quite shocking. I think I said something pretty shocking."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Now you're forgetting a few things."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was just talking about something else. We were just talking about something else."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can't believe I just met you yesterday. I can't believe we just met yesterday."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said, "Yes. No, let's leave it at that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara coughed and paused.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"He cheated on me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, oh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A second report would not have the same impact.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rather, all I could think about was how I was going to react. To think that I was making my friends think about things like this when I was ......</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To cover up these feelings, I poured the cocktail I had ordered down my throat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I had finally decided on this restaurant after a long preliminary inspection. I had no idea that I would be coming here with a stranger, a senior."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You invited me to ......."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I booked this course because I wanted to eat such delicious meat, sake, and soup with this boyfriend!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You don't look sad at all."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The somewhat theatrical intonation was indeed a tsukkomi.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, did they know?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara stuck out his tongue with a flattened tongue.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I had a boyfriend for the first time, but I had always turned down confessions from boys in junior high and high school."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wow, you've had quite a few confessions."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said smoothly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's as if he's saying, "I'm not really interested in that, but...</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, I thought there was no way I could be unattractive with this look, so I nodded my head there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then why did you go out with him this time?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara grunted in annoyance, then snapped his fingers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I wanted to do something that was more like a couple. I wanted to do something that was more like a couple."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ho."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I saw people's tweets on social networking sites and thought it would be nice to have a boyfriend. I thought it would be nice to have a boyfriend and visit different places."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, I see."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are quite a few people who make boyfriends and girlfriends for those reasons.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And at this time of year, people are posting more and more, as if to show off.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Couples who usually upload photos only after a date may start uploading photos before the date as well.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thanks to this, I have been looking at social networking sites much less frequently these days.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So I went out with someone for the first time. I don't want it to end with cheating. No, it's not that I don't want it to end, but I don't want to be left in the lurch."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, well, some people think so when they're done."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In my case, I was pretty much, no, seriously shocked, and I lightly went to bed for about a week.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I expected, Ayaka was worried about me and saved my notes for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"He cheated on me, but he still loves me. I'd like to get back at him a little and then break up with him."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll think about it from now on, but I think the safest thing to do would be to show them that you are friends with someone else. I need someone to cooperate with me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Good luck. Good luck."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With that said, I looked down at the beef filet that had just been brought in for the main course.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There you are, sir."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I refuse."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I haven't even said anything yet!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was wondering if you could make a similar request, as a work on such a subject ...... playing lovers was once serialized in a shonen magazine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had a bad feeling about this and refused beforehand, but judging from this reaction, it seems I was wrong.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Please, just a little bit! Start by showing him how we get along in front of that guy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh no, I'm sure I started this whole thing about coming here today, but that has nothing to do with it. Just ask somebody else to do it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm too embarrassed to ask this of a friend I know so well!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That may be true, but that doesn't mean you can't count on me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There must be someone better suited for the role. With Shinohara's looks, a single word would surely draw men from all over the place.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Look, I'll pay for this place. How about that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He said, "Aho, you can't do that to a girl younger than you. I'll just split it with you like normal."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If this had been a girl whom he had invited himself, he would have paid for the girl's portion in full with his card without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As expected, I did not intend to buy Shinohara a drink, but I still did not want to be the one to buy her a drink.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I made quite a bit of money at Santa, so if I can hire a senior for this, all the better. No matter what he says, I will force him to pay me, so please give up and hire me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hee, hee, hee, ini adalah kata-kata kasar yang mengerikan: ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll pay for it. Don't think about anything else, just eat this, beef."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Beef fillet."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The course list says Rossini-style.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senior, what do you mean by Rossini-esque?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I remember it was truffles and foie gras together. I think they used truffles and foie gras together."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wow! Senpai, erudite!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can't tell. I can't believe I only know because I ate the same thing with my ex-girlfriend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I remember the beef filet I had at that time was quite good, but I was not sure about the price.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With this in mind, I bring the beef fillet to my mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mecha-uma......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I let out a squeal and tantalize my taste buds.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This kind of meat is usually served with red wine, but unfortunately I don't know how good red wine tastes, so I open the menu to look for other cocktails.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara saw me like that and laughed with pride.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm so glad that I even examined the menu carefully. It's decided then, I'll look forward to working with you tomorrow."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I almost blew up when I heard that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wait a minute. I have plans tomorrow."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, why do seniors have plans for Christmas?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, aren't you treating me like crap too soon?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't think so at all. So, what are your plans?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm going to a party. Well, I don't plan on staying that long."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... matchmaking."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara looks indescribable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry I'm the kind of guy who goes to a party on Christmas."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I don't think so. Then, if it's done quickly, we'll talk afterwards, and if it doesn't look like it's going to be done, we'll talk later. Please contact me again."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As if it were a rule, Shinohara also begins to eat the beef fillet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked at Shinohara, who repeatedly said "delicious" in a voice that almost sounded like it had a heart mark at the end of it, and let out a sigh, wondering if he was the same type as Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's going to be a hell of a Merry Christmas.</span></p>
