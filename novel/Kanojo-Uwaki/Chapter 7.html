<h3>Chapter 7 &#8211; Circle Activities</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, who was waiting at the entrance to the gymnasium, jumped happily as I approached.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There's something so nice and exciting about the smell of a gymnasium."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The circle members around us look at us with interest.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Everyone is clearly aware of Shinohara, with the better basketball players using more fancy tricks than usual before shooting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara's presence is so strong that just being next to him makes me fidget. He is just bouncing around.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the lobby, there is a staircase leading to the second floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Let's take him there and have Shinohara go upstairs.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I stepped forward in the direction of the stairs, Shinohara followed me toddling along.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Where are you going?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Upstairs."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I say, and the sleeves are pulled back with a jerk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I turned around to see Shinohara looking up at me in frustration.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's too far from there. I'd like to watch the game from nearby. Can't I?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Apparently, they were aware of the second floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The gymnasium that "start" rents for its activities is a municipal one, and its courts are as large as those of a university gymnasium.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The strength of the municipal gymnasium is the expansive view of the court from the second floor seats, which should be perfect for watching the games.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I tilt my head back in my mind at Shinohara, who complains in spite of this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"On the ground floor, there's hardly any room to watch the game, and if a ball or something comes flying in, it's dangerous."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But it's very powerful. You have to watch basketball up close."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even as he says this, Shinohara's eyes turn in an unexpected direction.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's not so much that he's lying, but that he's not even trying to hide his lies.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Any other reasons?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I asked, Shinohara looked miffed for a moment and then exhaled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... you'll miss it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'I miss being thrown upstairs by myself! I hate acting alone in anything!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're talking about me in middle school!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Whatever you say!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara turns away with a huff.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was taken aback by the sight.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">An outstandingly cute college student in a trendy trench coat and with a great attention to her hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He has such an appearance, but he has many pure parts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then you should join us. You can participate without permission except on the day of the tournament."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The atmosphere at "start" is so relaxed that you can participate even if you have no experience.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since the girls' practice clothes are available for loan and "start" was selling the newcomers on how fun it is for beginners, there should be no problem.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Shinohara's face clouded at my suggestion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hm?" What's the matter, you like basketball, don't you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, yes. Yes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking at Shinohara, whose answer was muddled, I could tell that he was not too keen on the idea.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So, even in the same basketball game, there is a difference between watching a game and playing in a real game. It's only natural if you think about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If that is the case, we can't just ask them out without a fight.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The best outcome for both parties would be to return to the ground floor and let them watch the game as Shinohara said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There is space on the court side. The problem is the presence of other circle members, but, well, Shinohara doesn't seem to be worried about that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll be right downstairs to watch. Don't get hurt by the flying balls."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I said this, Shinohara's face lit up and she said, "Thank you!" and bowed his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since I did not do anything special, I felt embarrassed when they bowed their heads to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Just say it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ehehe."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara beams with happiness, and I relax my mouth too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I too was too lazy to do everything alone during my middle and high school years.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Always talking and playing with friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Being with like-minded friends is fun in itself, but on the other hand, if you are alone, you don't know how to kill your free time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But once he became a college student, his sensibilities naturally changed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Now I can go to karaoke by myself, but not when I was in middle and high school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was embarrassing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't want anyone to see me, and I wonder what the waiter thinks of me coming alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had the feeling then that I was being watched by such an unspecified number of people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But that too will shift.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While walking the streets or working part-time. I rarely take an interest in others I pass by, and even when I do, it rarely lasts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I eventually realized that the idea was not unique to me, but the same for many others, the feeling of being watched disappeared cleanly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Something that you would naturally notice if you had some alone time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Eventually, Shinohara's sensibilities will change.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I knew you were younger than me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I know a hundred times that Shinohara is younger than me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But there are not many opportunities to feel it again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara responded to my unspoken words with a frustrated look on her face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is that? Did it make me look old?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ha-ha-ha, that's not what I meant."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Amused, he puts his palm on Shinohara's head, and Shinohara lets out a high pitched "hiya" sound.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At the moment, I recall the response Shinohara took to Motosaka. On Christmas Day, Shinohara had wickedly shaken off Motosaka's hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I immediately retract my hand and apologize, saying I'm sorry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara had an expression of not knowing what he was talking about, but eventually he realized and smiled unconcernedly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't care if he's a senior."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm glad to hear that. Well, that's good."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah-ha, senpai adorable."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shut up!."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Somehow I could feel my face turning red, and I turned my back on Shinohara before he could realize what was happening.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can see the look of satisfaction on their faces as they raise the corners of their mouths.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I feel like I've fallen for the little devil attitude for the first time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I was returning to the court without turning around, Todo appeared from the doorway.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In each hand hangs a bash that he would have worn a moment ago.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, what's up, you two?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shinohara wants to watch the game on the first floor. Is that okay?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In response to my question, Todo looked at Shinohara briefly and nodded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's fine, that's all. People would rather be close to you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara thanked him cheerfully. Shinohara bowed his head with a bow, to which Todo responded with a wave of his hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Not at all. Since we're here, ...... I guess so. Shinohara-san, right? Come here for a minute."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Todo, who seems to have come up with something, calls Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I tried to follow Shinohara, but was stopped by Todo.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You go and practice by yourself. It's too much trouble."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What kind of trouble is that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Haha, seniors are such troublesome characters!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara laughs at my quip.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't remember being a troublesome character by any means, but the situation was relaxed, so let's call it good.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There is also the trust that Todo would not do anything poorly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I walked away from them and into the gym court.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The nostalgic smell of non-slip wax greeted me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In my circle "start," most of the time is allocated for games.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Practice time is not being taken because there are no major goals.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If I had to name a goal, it would be to win a tournament among the university's basketball clubs and secure funds for drinking and training camps.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I just want to move my body and enjoy basketball.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since people with such ideas gather together, it is inevitable that their activities will be match-centered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Of course I'm one of them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the very beginning, I had no intention of joining a club in college. I had always longed for the campus life, and I saw the long hours of club activities as a burden.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, as a member of the basketball team in junior high and high school, I was not willing to give up everything I had devoted myself to. It was not all fun and games, but I am the person I am today because of that time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I thought about it, my feet naturally went to basketball clubs during the new college student-inviting season.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Poke the ball lightly, recalling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The ball bounced off the floor and settled into my palm as if absorbed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I love the feeling of being able to leave my palm and come back to the place I envisioned.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I dribble in small increments, enjoying the feel of the rough ball for the first time in a long time, I see a third grader approaching me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I paused my dribbling and smiled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, how have you been?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm fine. It's been a while."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He is approached and utters an exchange that I don't know how many times today.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, it has been a long time since I participated in an activity, and everyone calls out to me. I wonder if everyone knows that I broke up with my girlfriend. I don't feel bad about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is probably much more burdensome to report your own breakup.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The ball settles in his right hand, and when he shoots it into the goal, it shoots a beautiful parabolic line and rocks the net. The moment when he scores a goal without snatching it from the ring remains pleasant even as a college student.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Naishu!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With a shout, the vision darkens.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Whoa."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I peeled off the towel wrapped around my back and turned around to find Shinohara standing there with his hands on his hips, as I had expected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The clothing has changed from plain clothes to jerseys.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... why the jersey?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I said this, Shinohara sniffed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are the top situations with girls that athletic guys are attracted to? Do you know what the top-ranked situation with a girl that athletic guys long for? I'll give you a hint: Mane!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mannequins and installations."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is the situation?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara voiced her dissatisfaction, picked up the ball as it rolled away, and handed it to me with both hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's the right answer?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The right answer is to join a club with a cute manager. Please come back to life."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"One mistake and you're too harsh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He let the ball settle in his palm and shot again. This time, too, the ball was sucked into the net without making a sound.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Isn't he really good?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You just happen to be in good shape."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In fact, a two-month blank period dulls one's shooting senses considerably. The shot I just took was just a fluke.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Suppressing the emotions that welled up at the first shot in a long time, I asked Shinohara a question.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Did Todo ask you to be his manager?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, I guess you could say I was asked, or given a choice."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What the hell is that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara picked up the ball again and began to dum-dum it, this time with awkward hands. Shinohara replied as he moved under the goal.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I thought it would be a waste of time to just observe, so I was taken to the manager's office. I had never been a manager before."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Heh, don't interrupt me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Harsh!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Shinohara said this, he shot with both hands. But his shooting form is a mess.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because the jump was released long before it reached the highest point, the ball went straight to the goal ring.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The ball hit just below the ring and hit Shinohara in the face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Fuh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A low muffled voice, never heard from Shinohara before, rises.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...... is pretty strong.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I approached to call out to him as he was cowering and shaking, Shinohara looked up with a start.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As expected, the nose-head is reddish.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Seniors!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I hate basketball!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't care!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I could tell by the way he just played that he was not used to playing basketball. My circle has a welcoming atmosphere even for beginners, but as expected, there is not a single beginner in winter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had thought about mixing them into the game, but letting them be the manager would be the best choice for both the circle and Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Let me get up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">They spread their hands and beg for it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had no choice but to pull on one arm, and when I grabbed it around the second arm, I felt a softer sensation than I had expected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hentai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't be ridiculous."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He kicked Shinohara's words to the curb and pulled him to his feet with a yank.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara staggered to her feet and rubbed the spot where I had been holding her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I offered him my hands, but I didn't expect him to grab my arms. Senpai is a strange man, isn't he?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Holding hands is kind of sexy, isn't it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I think my arms are a hundred times worse. But that's okay.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara rolled up the sleeves of his jersey and picked up the hair elastic that was fitted on his arm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She spun around to tie her flowing hair into a ponytail. The bunched up hair softly snatched the tip of my nose.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How are you doing?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Cute, cute."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said that and went to the basket where the balls were stacked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, hey! That's all you got? !"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ignoring the little devil's voice that descended from behind me, I took the stacked balls with one hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...... That guy looks so different when his hair is bunched up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason why she suddenly looked more mature was definitely because of her hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought for the first time that it was unfair, even though I was of the opposite sex, to have a look that could change my impression of myself in an instant.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWpFSYMEy-8OtYKenuyHBw4FbHYlJcQ2M3GLp9e-t-G07mGq4DeShrPdIZWplzi_ncpPoIBX2kjCOVFXKDs3TN_0a3Fti4eAJ6aMC6J8XG9T61a2W-6yuE6wW4fJP8AORn1iqEHtrLyhj0GPO7aE7aZ_JpYtF25-v1zqSXHqs5Y2V95_VUMUNV2ixP/s800/00021.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiWpFSYMEy-8OtYKenuyHBw4FbHYlJcQ2M3GLp9e-t-G07mGq4DeShrPdIZWplzi_ncpPoIBX2kjCOVFXKDs3TN_0a3Fti4eAJ6aMC6J8XG9T61a2W-6yuE6wW4fJP8AORn1iqEHtrLyhj0GPO7aE7aZ_JpYtF25-v1zqSXHqs5Y2V95_VUMUNV2ixP/s16000/00021.jpeg" /></span></a></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I think I understand a little bit why men are being dropped by that little devil.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The buzzer, signaling the end of warm-ups, echoed through the gymnasium.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The men's and women's games are played in rotation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The end of circle activity time is already approaching, and the only thing left is the women's game.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The women's game just started and I'm down stretching my legs, heavy with fatigue.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I felt a decline in my legs, which were heavier than usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though he is still young, his body becomes this heavy if he does not exercise properly for several months.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At this rate, I fear when I enter the workforce. The aging process has already begun.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I was thinking about this, a plastic bottle flew out of nowhere and hit me on the thigh, making a dull thud.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll do it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Todo said, pointing to a plastic bottle that had rolled away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I check and the plastic bottle is a brand new sports drink.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He must have bought it from the vending machine in the lobby.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, thank you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I instantly let bygones be bygones and thanked him for throwing the plastic bottle at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Todo sat down next to him, wiping the sweat off his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Your girlfriend's incredibly popular."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That ain't her."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I responded with a bitter smile, the corners of Todo's mouth turned up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked at Shinohara and saw that he was in the process of serving drinks to circle members. The normally deserted water fountain was crowded today, mainly with men.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He may lack the knowledge of basketball to be a manager, but if the morale of the boys is so high, Shinohara should probably stay in this circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, that's impossible."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Todo stopped his hand to take a sports drink and tilted his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, Shinohara probably won't become a manager."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think it's great that you just come to a circle to observe and suddenly join, even though you have no purpose. It's not like I have a purpose."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I have a feeling that ...... is meant to be a way to pass the time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I think the fact that we have been spending more time together lately is just a way for Shinohara to pass the time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because I'm so divided, that guy feels safe to barge into my house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After hearing my response, Todo laughed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If that's what it takes to kill time, I'm impressed."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's true."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You should learn from him, Yuu. Let's raise the tension."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"These things are often said."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I am certainly not full of vitality like Shinohara, nor do I have the social skills to find the best response depending on the person I come in contact with like Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Unfortunately, it's easiest for me to just be myself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have no intention of changing the way things are now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Upon hearing my words, Todo tapped me lightly on the shoulder.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know. I'm relieved to see you're back on track."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The corners of my mouth turned up slightly at Todo's words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I chewed on the nostalgic echo of the ball echoing through the gymnasium for a while.</span></p>
