<h3>Chapter 5 &#8211; Coincidence</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">Today is said to be the lowest temperature in several years.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is late January, and the city has completely returned to its usual atmosphere, not only the Christmas mood, but even the New Year's mood has disappeared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The past month hasn't been particularly unusual. Everything was pretty much the same as last year, from buying lottery tickets in a flurry with friends to showing up at various New Year's parties.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If there is one thing that is different from last year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senior, you made quite a mess again while I wasn't here~."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The one who visits my house three times a week is Mayu Shinohara, a former Santa Claus.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shut up, a man can't be bothered to clean up after himself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is that incomprehensible theory? It will be house dust."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, in a distracted voice, folds up the clothes scattered around the studio.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, don't do that. I'll fold it myself later."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I believed him for a week after he told me that, but he never folded.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"We're doing it tomorrow."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara replies in a tone of utter disbelief, but does not rest on his hands as he folds his clothes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">How did this happen?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the day Shinohara came to my house at the end of the year, he mentioned that he would be coming about twice a week.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I think that in itself made me happy to have a new connection.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, the current situation is completely different from what I had initially imagined.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is more accurately described as commuting rather than coming to the house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although I am perplexed by this situation, there is one thing I have been seriously thankful for since Shinohara started attending my house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senior, I'm going to use your kitchen again today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, thank you"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Yes, it's cooking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Living alone as a male student is a miserable experience.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He wakes up in the afternoon, eats bread, and comes home after eating out at night. On days when he does not meet with friends, he buys a convenience store lunch box.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My tongue, completely starved for home-cooked food after such a life, was delighted by the meals Shinohara prepared for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I really appreciate it. I'll have to thank you all at once."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I live alone too, and it's just a side thing. I just eat with my seniors when I'm free, so don't worry about it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Really? You're a good guy, you know what's in my wallet."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is a relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This month, I have not been working part-time as much as usual, and my savings is not very secure. Considering that I will start job hunting from now on, I don't have much money to spare.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll take a Louis Vuitton wallet for the thank you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't you dare ask me for a big, fat thank-you!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's the seniors who flirt with gratuities for their free services. There isn't a college student who wouldn't jump at the chance to be offered a Louis Vuitton purse."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why is it that you've decided to thank me with a Louis Vuitton wallet ......?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I lay down on the bed in despair. Well, even though we split the cost of food, it doesn't change the fact that he takes the time and effort to cook for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I might be willing to buy that much for you after a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For example, yes, birthdays.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"When's your birthday?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tomorrow."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I bounce out of bed and meet eyes with a crackling Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara stopped in her position with her apron around her waist and tilted her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You said, "...... No, well what the heck. I'm just surprised. How old are you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I returned the safe question and laid back down again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It occurred to me that the only time you can casually ask a woman her age is when you are a student.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I guess so." It's tough when you're in the workforce."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, it is. It's frightening because there's no upper age limit."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara makes a gesture of shaking himself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then he coughed coherently and opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You asked me a question earlier...I'm nineteen. One more year until I drink legally!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Uh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The phrase "legally," bothered me, but I decided not to tweak it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Shinohara once said, college students are like that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mmmm. Somehow, the reaction is bad. It will be legal soon! Even my seniors have been legal since they turned 18..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, yes, well, that's true, but don't talk like that outside. Don't talk like that outside, you never know where or who is listening in these days."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Silence the juniors who are about to say something really roguish.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The junior seemed unhappy that he was not allowed to finish, but he did not feel like continuing, so he turned his head away and said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's okay, this is my senior's room. There is only me and my senpai here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's not the point."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's the problem."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara said once and for all, then took his phone out of his pocket.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A shaking phone indicates that someone has received a call.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Let's go out to dinner somewhere tomorrow."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Casually, I suggested that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It might not be a bad idea to take Shinohara somewhere as a way of thanking him for his daily efforts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have no plans tomorrow anyway.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had no confidence in my own sense of taste when it came to giving gifts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara looked up at my invitation, but eventually shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, I can't make it tomorrow."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, really?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't look so surprised. I'm planning my birthday in advance, too. I'm going to have my friends celebrate it with me!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara happily makes a V-sign. He is apparently blessed with friends, although he usually shows glimpses of the breadth of his friendships.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm, what's wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Senpai, did you maybe think I should buy you a wallet for your birthday?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I nodded, having no choice. Then Shinohara waved her hand as if in a panic.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was just kidding, I was just kidding! I'm not seriously going to beg a senior who lives alone for a brand new purse!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know, maybe I can't afford a brand name wallet. I just thought I'd give you something for your birthday."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There is no ate to give gifts to others for a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Now the day I tried to give my ex-girlfriend a gift before is stuck in my mind. I had a slight desire to dispel such memories by giving Shinohara a gift.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was like, "Oh, really? You've been paying me a tribute for just one month after we met."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I want to give it to you, so take it, don't be a bitch about it. I want to give it to you, so take it without question, and if you don't like it, throw it away. If you don't like it, throw it away. If you don't like it, throw it away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I shrug my shoulders, Shinohara once again sounds surprised, "Oh, you're serious, senpai?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Did they think it was a joke or something?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara seemed a bit thoughtful, but he did not feel bad.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, if that's what you mean. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The corners of my mouth involuntarily turned up when Shinohara responded, "I'm sorry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Gifts are uplifting for those who give them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Do you want anything?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I asked, Shinohara put his hand on his chin in a thoughtful gesture.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, I'll leave it to ...... seniors to make their choice. I know leaving it to you is probably the most difficult thing to do, but that's why I prefer to leave it to you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm like, "Ugh, so it comes to that. ...... Well, okay. I'll take care of it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll keep my fingers crossed!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He lightly replies to the winking Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To be honest, I don't know what kind of design Shinohara would like. One thing I can say is that it probably won't be to Shinohara's taste, even if I make the decision on my own. It is very difficult to know her taste after knowing her for only one month, even if it was her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Still, if you are lovers, it would be better to choose one yourself, but this time it is just a gift for a junior. It would be better to consult a reliable friend here.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The first thing that came to mind was, of course, that guy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Please."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I put my hands together to make a request, Ayaka, being the reliable woman that she is, raised her eyebrows.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I called Ayaka in front of the main gate of the university, but it did not seem to be a favorable response.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm the one who gave the thank-you gift to Mr. Shinohara?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, yes, please."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh no."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What do you mean "no"?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka exhaled in disgust and continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You asked me if we could meet, so I went out of my way to meet you. I thought you were going to buy me dinner."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I wouldn't go out of my way to call a group full of women to buy me a drink, because that takes a lot of courage."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was during lunch break when I called Ayaka. It was quite hard for me to join Ayaka's group who was still eating lunch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, of course. In fact, they thought I was hitting on them again."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Seriously?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I lied. All the kids there know that you and I were friends in high school."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't freak out. That's a nasty lie."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I get along well with Ayaka, who stands out from the rest of the faculty, but I don't get involved with the other girls much.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I am with Ayaka, there are times when girls I don't know come over, and she always tries to get alone with me for some reason or another.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason is simple: "It's easy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka seemed to be relatively straightforward in the group I just mentioned, but in other shallow relationships, she is always outwardly concerned with her words and behavior.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He seems to enjoy such behavior, but he probably needs a place to rest his wings once in a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"First of all, Mr. Shinohara said he would leave it to you, right? Then what's the point if you don't make the choice? It's a feeling, isn't it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, Shinohara is a rational woman. I saw that she was putting pressure on me when she used the word "leave it to me" with a guy I hadn't even started dating. So I want something practical."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hah, well, whatever."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka doesn't seem to be into it at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I guess there is no possibility, though, as they don't refuse with reasons such as part-time jobs. If this is the case, we will need something to push the envelope.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Saika."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You've got a test coming up. Don't you want to know the past papers?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry, but I don't think there's anything you know that I don't know that I don't know."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's right. If I were to face Ayaka, who has a wide range of friendships, I would be no match for her, even if there were five of me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Instead, I was the one who was always being shown past papers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I remember now. You gave away the past papers I gave you to another friend, didn't you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Geez!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll make sure to buy you dinner for that, too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka sniffles. I have no excuse for that one either, and vow to make it up to her another time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But that's not the point of this story.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I decided to exercise my last resort.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"A limited time buffet at the hotel in front of the ...... station. How about that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Nah."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Starting this weekend, a buffet will be held on the top floor of the hotel for one week only. It is not an ordinary buffet, and the price is high because it offers luxury foods and delicacies, but it seems to have been effective for Ayaka, who has an eye for such unusual restaurants.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Okay, if that's the way it's going to be, I don't blame you!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was relieved to see Ayaka approve so vigorously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was an unplanned expense, but it might have been just as well if the other party was Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is not only Shinohara who is usually taken care of, but also Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I would have to thank two people in one day, but it's nice to have a day like that once in a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Later that day, Ayaka and I were visiting the biggest shopping mall in the city as planned. The main hall, which was filled with colorful decorations at Christmas time and unified in red and white at the end of the year, was now replaced by a banner announcing a bargain sale.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She visited many stores to choose a wallet to present to Shinohara, but could not find one that Ayaka would approve of. It has been two hours.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"All the wallets seem to be the same."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm getting tired and I can't help but hear those words coming out of my mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You asked me to choose. You said it was your choice, and now that I've accepted, I won't compromise."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't worry ......, I'll make sure the Vikings are fully covered."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I've accepted the job," he said. Once I accepted the job, I had to make sure Mr. Shinohara was happy or my stock would drop."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"He's got a good personality. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With that said, I leave the fourth restaurant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The store carried brands that would be standard for a college girl, but nothing seemed to make Ayaka groan.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The four stores we have visited so far are all brand-name stores that cater to students.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I became a college student and had more money to spend, there were more people around me who cared about brands, as if in proportion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I myself am not that attached to brands and prefer to wear simple clothes, but people who like brands unify their entire body with their favorite brands.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if the design is not that great, if it is a popular brand, that alone will give it a good reputation, so I knew that if I wanted to give a gift to a girl, I could be sure to get some brand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And yet, Ayaka, who wears four of those brand-name stores on her sleeve, must be very particular.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There it is. Here's where we're going next."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka pointed to an information board with a series of store names. The store, located on the eighth floor, was a brand famous for being quite expensive for students.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Kim ......."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I flinched, Ayaka grabbed my bag and held me back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm a member here, and we're having a members-only secret sale. I'm a member here and we're having a members-only secret sale right now. If you buy two items, you get an extra discount, so I'll buy something for you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, that's bad enough."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's okay. It's a good opportunity for me to fool myself into thinking that I'm helping my friend. I'll buy that bag I've always wanted."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you sure that's ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Let's go!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With a booming voice, he grabs me by the arm, this time with a jerk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I climbed the escalator and arrived at the front of the restaurant, I sensed an upscale atmosphere unlike any other restaurant I had seen before.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not good at this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay, let's go."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah. ......."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I received a near-ignorable reply and followed her. I glanced at the bag and saw that it was priced at 90,000 yen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I'm going home."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, it's too early! I have some stuff you can buy!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From there, Ayaka acted alone, and it was ten minutes later when they met up again in the restaurant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On his arm already hangs the bag he is about to buy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I found a nice purse. Come here!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka grabs me by the neck and moves me to where the wallet is located. The price is ......</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Twenty-one thousand yen. Well, that's not so bad."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My pocketbook is not warm enough to say, "This is not so bad" for a wallet that costs over 20,000 yen, but it seems that I have been looking at expensive products for a long time and my sense of money has become dull.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Today is the cheapest day for purses, so you can probably get one for fifteen thousand or so. Good for you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wow, they give you such a discount? That's tempting."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But that's only if it was a purchase for yourself. When it comes to buying this wallet for someone else, you need to be very prepared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I calm down, it seems outrageous to give a 10,000+ gift to a girl who is not my girlfriend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a good thing that it was with Shinohara, but it was the kind of amount that other girls might have been drawn to.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll go get the waiter, he'll have to open the showcase."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's early. I'm still trying to figure it out."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You said you'd leave it to me. The price is within our budget, and I think this is the only way to go."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That being said, I do wish you'd ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I hesitated, I suddenly saw a pair of what appeared to be college girls.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The duo strangely attracted my eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The atmosphere is glamorous, but that much I am used to seeing in college. I followed them with my gaze, wondering why I was so drawn to them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What caught my attention was a college student with dyed ash hair standing in front of the showcase while fiddling with her phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I couldn't see his face, but I remembered his style, his gestures, his mood.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The college girl seemed to have noticed my gaze and looked up suddenly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472; &#9472; My ex-girlfriend, Reina Aisaka, was there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Rena."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A dry voice escapes my mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rena looked as surprised as I was, and her eyes widened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"......Yuta-kun."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sound of it is nostalgic. Their voices, facial expressions and gestures all stimulate my memories of those days.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have also seen the long black coat, red scarf, and high heels before.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her hair color was a little lighter than it had been when we were dating, but there was no doubt that she was someone I had once had a heart-to-heart with.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a few seconds passed without either party saying anything, the college girl next to Reina opened her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Rena, is that him? Is she a friend?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh?" Oh, yeah. Something like that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rena slurred her words, looked at me again, and laughed in annoyance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... what a long time. How have you been?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I exhale loudly in my mind at the words, which are probably social pleasantries to the eyes of those around me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The college girl next to me apparently didn't know me. I had been dating for about a year, so I had several friends of Rena's who knew each other, but this was the first time I had met this girl.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The fact that Rena attended a women's college where many of the students were considered to be young ladies was a distant factor, and they did not have many mutual acquaintances.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Seeing Rena's friend with a curious look on her face, I had a gut feeling that this girl knew nothing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"......, well, there you go."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is also a safe word to reply.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's the first time in two months, but there's no need to imitate Rena's friend, who would know nothing about it, to tell her about that incident.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What I want to say is that there is nothing more to say now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We broke up the day after she cheated on me, and even then Reina made no excuses.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I told her we should break up, and she just nodded silently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Only two months. It may be short in words, but at the beginning of our breakup, it was so slow that I felt like throwing up when a day passed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So the feeling is that it has been a long time since we have met again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When Rena was my girlfriend, I cared for her so much and had so many feelings that I couldn't fully describe with just liking her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If we separate, it will be just another person.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you buying that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The words that Reina would have spun out in an attempt to have some kind of safe conversation were for the wallet I was holding.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In his hand is a wallet to be given to Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's a little expensive, but it's okay. It's a little expensive."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see. I hope you're pleased."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hm."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a short reply, he turned his attention back to the showcase, as if this was the end of the conversation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I feel my feelings for Reina are becoming more organized.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Immediately after the breakup, that's when my chest tightened up just looking at the pictures of their faces.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Now, my feelings were disturbed at the moment we met, but that was nothing compared to right after we broke up. From now on, time will tell.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I mean, will I see you again?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What about...?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was not I who responded, but Ayaka, who had been silent from a while ago.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rena also looks at Ayaka as if surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you insane?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">His voice was filled with plenty of contempt.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rena and Ayaka are not directly acquainted with each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We tried to meet several times when we were dating, but there was never a convenient date.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Ayaka had been shown Rena's face many times by me, and she knew.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Reina, perhaps sensing this, turned away and left the restaurant with a quick look.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I passed by, I left a "see you later" note.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... hey."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After making sure Rena leaves the store, I talk to Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka took one look in the direction in which Rena was walking and then opened her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry. You were trying to be normal, so I tried to be patient, but I was still pissed off."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'I'm glad you feel that way, though. He's my ex-girlfriend."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I recognized her right away because she kept showing me pictures of her. She's pretty, but that's all."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, yeah. Yeah."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Probably there were many good things about them besides being cute.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But every human being has his or her good qualities.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It would be wild to tell Ayaka that now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka was angry for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thanks for the ......."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka chuckled at the thank-you that came out of her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was like, "I don't know how to thank you for this. Your ex-girlfriend's friend had nothing to do with it, and I did something bad to her."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka said and exhaled heavily to let her anger escape.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll pay for it all with my credit card and give it back to you in cash later. I'll pay by credit card and you pay me back in cash later."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My thoughts had completely faded from shopping when I was reunited with Reina, but Ayaka's words brought me back to myself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As Ayaka quickly heads to the cash register, I see the wallet she took from me in her hand. In her other hand, she has the bag she is looking for, and she is looking very cheerful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm always thrilled when I make an expensive purchase.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't even know, but ...... well, never mind. I'll buy a wallet. I'll pay for it myself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wanted to clear my blurred feelings after meeting Reina by splurging. If it was a gift to the person who has been taking care of me everyday, it would kill two birds with one stone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I'll get it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I want to buy something that gives me points when I buy it with my card. Give me 500 points."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But I'm so stubborn!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You don't say this when other people are around, but as soon as the two of us are alone, you do this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have no complaints about them making it easy for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then you wait outside."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes yes yes ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Reluctantly folding, Ayaka headed for the cash register in a good mood.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After making sure Ayaka is paying the bill at the cash register, I turn my head in the direction where Rena last left off.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My ex-girlfriend was no longer in sight, perhaps lost in the hustle and bustle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Five minutes of waiting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After leaving the store, Ayaka said to me, "Here. She gave me a bag containing her purse.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I see something other than a wallet in that bag and take it out without a second thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is a key case. The discreet black luster suggests that the price was not cheap.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You can have it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I mean, why would you want to do that? I mean, why the suddenness?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's your birthday present. Your birthday is in July and it's already past. Come to think of it, I've never given you a birthday present before."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, really? That's so cool, are you sure about this!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have a surprisingly high voice myself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Gifts are nerve-wracking for both the giver and the receiver.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The person giving the gift is nervous, wondering if the recipient will like it, and the recipient is nervous that a poor response will make the recipient feel bad.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm the type of person who is particularly bad at receiving gifts, and even when I'm really happy, my reactions are slurred.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But now I got something I really wanted, and I couldn't help but get excited. It's been a really long time since I've received a gift and had a good reaction without being conscious of it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka also beamed with satisfaction at my reaction.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's all right. I'm not in pain."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, thank you so much. Seriously."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'I'm glad you're happy. All right, let's go then."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, where?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm a Viking! Show me with attitude and money that you appreciate me giving you the first gift of your own to a man!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, the latter ruined it!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I poked at her, Ayaka laughed out loud.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka starts walking excitedly in the direction of the hotel where the buffet will be held.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I followed along, I let my mind ruminate on what I had just said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9472; &#9472; Was this the first time Ayaka gave a gift to a man by herself?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though we were close, I didn't keep track of our friendships, so I thought it was normal to at least give them gifts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My mouth relaxes at the sight of Ayaka's back as she walks quickly, unable to wait for the buffet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka probably likes my relationship as a complete friend that does not develop into a romantic relationship.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It wouldn't be a bumble to at least be happy that I was the one who gave Ayaka her first gift.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My mind, which had been disturbed by the encounter with Reina, was already completely healed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka and I enjoyed the buffet and I was on my way home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On the way, I take out my wallet, which is now completely light. I thought about buying a cup of coffee from a vending machine and going home, but there was only enough money in it to make me hesitate to do so. Where did the money go?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It was expensive. It was good, but..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He blurts it out and puts his wallet in his back pocket.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">How much money they have spent today alone would be something a student living alone would not want to imagine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If the expense was due to an event like Christmas, but today is not an event, just a weekday, it is frightening.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The buffet was not like a family restaurant with an assortment of dishes, but rather single items that would be a good value.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since I ate it to my heart's content, I suppose I should be satisfied with the lightness of this wallet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I didn't realize you couldn't even buy coffee. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I let out a very pitiful voice and headed home this time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I will probably have to forgo the game console and other devices I wanted this month.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I could see my apartment, my home, and the light was on in my room. Today Shinohara said she was going to celebrate her birthday with her friends, but that must have been over.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['I'm going to finish early today, so please put the key in the mailbox.']</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The line came this morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was not feeling a sense of urgency about being burglarized, so I agreed without thinking, and put the key in the mailbox.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The current time is 22:30.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't know what he is doing up to this hour, but he must be at someone's house right now goofing off and reading manga.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I climbed the creaking stairs and stood in front of the door. My house was on the second floor of a rather old, if not ramshackle, apartment building.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I opened the door and said, "I'm home," and the sound of the TV greeted me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A familiar face peeks out from the end of the hallway.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara's loosely curled hair was bunched into a ponytail.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah, senpai. Welcome back."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm home. What are you doing here this late?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"As you can see, it's television, television."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As she replied, Shinohara changed the channel she was watching. The screen where the woman was being interviewed switched to a news program.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Heh, what were you looking at?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't tell anyone. Don't pry into the girls."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're not prying too hard. Give me the remote."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I take the remote control and change the channel appropriately, I reach the woman I just saw. The message in the upper left corner read, "When do you feel like having a boyfriend?" and I could see that it was a love talk show.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Heh, I didn't expect you to watch such a damsel-in-distress show."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Aah! That sucks, I can't believe I didn't expect that!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why were you watching this show?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I asked, Shinohara looked away as if lost for a moment.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... Well, if you don't want to say it, that's okay. Anyway, I'm ...... today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was wondering if I was out of sync."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're going to say that? What? What's going on?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, you're cold! I tried so hard to be brave!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara puts a lot of effort into her eyes, but it's just cute and doesn't do anything for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was dating Motosaka-senpai, right? I was suspected of having a sense of being out of touch with the world because of that. Mainly in my mind."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Huh." That's a little late for that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is impossible to determine in general whether a person is out of step with the world, as it depends on the environment in which he or she has spent his or her life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But, well, I guess I'm a slightly out-of-touch thinker in the world I think of. Not that there's anything wrong with that. It's just unusual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You told your friends about the breakup, didn't you? I know we broke up last month and it's a little late for that, but I just wanted to report it to you in person."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Heh, and what was your response?'"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said, "Yes, I am. I'm sorry you had to go through all that trouble of being cheated on, and I hope the next time you fall in love, it will be better."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmmm. That's a good friend."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, that's right."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara shakes his head as if to say that's not what he wants to say.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was itching to hear those words. I'm sorry for the trouble I caused the seniors on Christmas Day. But we only went out because we wanted to act like a couple. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wasn't hurt, Shinohara shrugs.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But I've been cared for and comforted all day. I'm exhausted today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's why you broke up rather early, even though it's your birthday."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Yes. I went out with Motosaka-senpai because I wanted to have a ...... couple-like event, and I was angry that he cheated on me, but I wasn't hurt. Am I out of line?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you out of sync?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I knew it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara laughed at my honest impression. It was a carefree laugh, not looking particularly hurt.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sure there are plenty of guys out there who go out with Shinohara because they want to do the same couple-like things that Shinohara does. But usually you have to like them a little to go out with them, and if they cheat on you, it hurts more than a little."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thinking back, Shinohara just said he was pissed off right after he had been cheated on, and did not show any signs of being hurt by the affair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why were you so mad at him when he cheated on you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Because I was pissed off."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Because I was mocked."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Maybe he was jealous because he was attracted to a woman other than himself? Like, "Did you lie about your love for me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, it's not. I was persistent in confessing my feelings to him, so he confessed to me for the first time and then cheated on me. It's not more and it's not less. It's neither more nor less than that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, who said this, eventually looked at me in silence and furrowed her brow anxiously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... am i light?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He still thought that his thinking was somewhat out of sync with others, and he began to wonder if the next one would be lighter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To be honest, I didn't have all the ingredients to immediately deny it, but I didn't dislike Shinohara's way of thinking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Everyone has their own way of thinking, so why don't we just wait for that meeting to come along someday?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I waited, I met him, and he cheated on me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"............ I see."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's with the sorry voice?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I'm sorry. I'm sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I just told you that attitude is exhausting!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara's cheeks puffed out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He then bent his knees into a triangle and buried his face in them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I envy everyone. It's nice to have a couple that likes each other."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Indeed."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For a moment, the face of Reina, whom I had just met again, flashed through my mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To cover it up, I fumbled with the bag Ayaka gave me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Here, I'll do it. Purse."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ew."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara instantly undid his triangular sitting position and approached me. A sweet scent, not that of house shampoo, tickled my nose.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Happy birthday. Keep up the good work."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I had a crush on ......."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see. I'm glad you're pleased."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I've always wanted to buy this brand of accessories. I've always wanted to buy accessories from this brand, so how did you know? Are you a genius?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As expected of Ayaka, his choices are always spot on.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He said he could somehow tell from everyday conversations.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...... Forgive me for dressing like that.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNbYH-x9L37s1UySqXhNVXdveCxVc5lfx3-fSBI2_cm7kYaNyOfk-GvRWKmO1ITSyn-wQlWHc_LDIxC_jgtZNlxlfO73-KMXl_1QSkKtJsrwsJPmLQJye4iiF-c-OjPygAfNeSJ73aA-t6KcaNvSrhWgZZ1VGYxrDhdvwdkMJegY5_o88eQAnRC95E/s800/00018.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEiNbYH-x9L37s1UySqXhNVXdveCxVc5lfx3-fSBI2_cm7kYaNyOfk-GvRWKmO1ITSyn-wQlWHc_LDIxC_jgtZNlxlfO73-KMXl_1QSkKtJsrwsJPmLQJye4iiF-c-OjPygAfNeSJ73aA-t6KcaNvSrhWgZZ1VGYxrDhdvwdkMJegY5_o88eQAnRC95E/s16000/00018.jpeg" /></span></a></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At that moment, the intercom rang.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A loud sound, which does not suit a one-room apartment, is emanating from the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Who is it at this hour?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara stood up and walked to the front door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He must have really liked it, as he was holding the wallet with great care.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was not a cheap purchase, but seeing her like that made me glad I gave it to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With a clang, I heard Shinohara open the door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The next thing I heard was a familiar voice, not Shinohara's.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you doing here? What are you doing here?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... Ayaka Senpai"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Across from Shinohara, my eyes met Ayaka's.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I involuntarily turn my face away from Ayaka's gaze.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Come to think of it, I don't remember telling Ayaka that Shinohara was frequenting my house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have no impure motive at all for letting Shinohara stay at home until this hour, but I wonder what the opposite party would think of this situation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's obvious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... Yes? Are you guys dating by any chance?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Sure enough, Ayaka sounded surprised.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I look at his face, it's not the usual teasing look, but one of pure surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thinking back, Ayaka was the first person I reported to every time I had a girlfriend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From Ayaka's point of view, it must be doubly surprising that I had a girlfriend without saying anything to Ayaka, and that it was with an acquaintance, Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I waved to Ayaka, who seemed to be at a loss for words, as I walked to the front door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He said, "Tough shit. If something happened, I'd probably tell you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Still, Ayaka shook her head after a few seconds of silence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sure ...... you might do that. Anyone would if they saw this situation."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, that's for sure. I wouldn't be so confident of clearing up a misunderstanding if it were anyone other than you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, no, I'm confused too. Don't expect me to understand everything."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka added, "I'm usually surprised," and closed the front door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The north wind that had been entering the room was blocked, and the room was lit by a slight heat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Still, you understand it better than others."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, maybe so."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">College students are often ambiguous about their relationships with men and women, but I myself have not been in a room with a girl I was not dating many times. And when it was just the two of us, I couldn't remember many times.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since I was with Shinohara at the time of 23:30, Ayaka's misunderstanding was quite natural.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But the misunderstanding would have been cleared up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just as I was about to apologize to Shinohara for this conviction, unexpected words came out of his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ayaka-senpai was such an insane person who would visit my house at this hour."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka paused for a moment after hearing these words and tilted her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... Oh, I don't want to be told by a minor who stays up this late at a guy's house she's not dating."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No...no, why are you guys fighting as soon as you meet?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He goes in for a restraining order.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shinohara, Ayaka is a senior."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... it was. Sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara apologized honestly, but his eyes remained fixed on Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You didn't act like this when we were at the party.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&nbsp;&#9472; No, it's not.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">They had not spoken a word to each other at that time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What is it?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I intuited this from the tense atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I suddenly turned my gaze to Ayaka, who was staring at Shinohara without losing her calm expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a short pause, Ayaka opens her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... this girl's not really a problem. I've been her junior for a long time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"From the old days?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had heard that he was a junior, but was it from before college?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But I don't know if this is related to the reason why the atmosphere between Shinohara and Ayaka is slightly tense.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...... and I don't need to know that now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's a two-person problem.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After giving it some thought, I decided to add a few words to Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shinohara, stop right here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara glanced at me at that comment and bowed his head in an honest manner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry. I said it a little harshly after all."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka does not seem bothered by Shinohara's apology and shakes her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's okay. I'm sorry too. I was just trying to stir things up. Besides, from the looks of it, it doesn't sound like they're really together."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, sir."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Only there, Shinohara nodded honestly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was only a few weeks ago that Shinohara complained that they had never really liked each other.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka seemed to be satisfied with that, and put her slender fingertips on the doorknob.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry to have disturbed you. I'll see you next time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, I'll see you at college."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka responds to me with a smile and turns her back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But as he turned on his heel, his gaze seemed to be caught by something Shinohara was carrying.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is this it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara noticed the gaze and showed Ayaka the object in his hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I just got this wallet from one of my seniors."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Dokiri."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At those words, my heart leapt.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka looks at the wallet held up by Shinohara and frowns a little.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's just as well, because the wallet was Ayaka's choice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... so. Lovely purse."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka answered shortly and tapped me on the shoulder as she left.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're doing great, you've got good taste."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is it okay? Ayaka did not seem to be bothered by the nuance in my gaze, which included the question, "Are you sure?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry to interrupt."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With a final greeting, Ayaka walks out the front door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I could do nothing but watch Ayaka melt away in the darkness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shinohara, hey."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... eh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I crossed my legs on the sofa and Shinohara sat upright on the floor in front of me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the outside, the situation could be problematic, but unfortunately, this is my house. I don't have to worry about anyone seeing me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senior."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What the hell?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's cold, the floor."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't have a floor heater in the room I live alone. I mean, you sat there before."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He takes one look at Shinohara, who is dressed very conservatively, and recrosses his legs.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have only one thing to say to Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The way you were acting just now. Ayaka is still a senior, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... yes. My apologies."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Santa, lying on his face, is less energetic than he was immediately after his breakup with Motosaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the way he apologizes honestly, I know he is sorry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At least, that he behaved that way in front of me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So I decided to change directions a bit.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... and I'd like to be mad at you. Just act normal in front of me and that's all that matters."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as my words reached her, Shinohara looked up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The cashier's expression is cheerful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes! I'll do it normally!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">'What kind of declaration is that? ...... Well, go home today. It's late."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was the first time that Shinohara stayed home until the time when the sun was about to change. Judging by the time difference alone, it was not a big deal, since I always let her go home at 23:00.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's rare nowadays for people to send girls home this close to the last train. You should worry a little."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara says this and heads for the front door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The flattering entranceway is even smaller with three or four of my boots lined up in a row, but Shinohara seems accustomed to it and stretches her legs out to her heels.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I mean, don't you care? Why did I behave so rudely?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't care. It's none of my business."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't tell me it's none of my business, I'm usually a little hurt."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara turned to me once she finished putting on her heels.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But I like that kind of dryness from my senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, yeah. Hurry up and close the door, it's cold."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... You're a real dullard! Please react a little!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara shows his tongue for the last time, and the door closes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't say things like, "I like ...... a lot," lightly."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I know Shinohara has no such feelings, but in high school he would have certainly soared.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That makes the man look bad if he gets it wrong.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Girls may be the same way, but men are also men and difficult to live with.</span></p>
