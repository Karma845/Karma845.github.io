<h3>Chapter 10 &#8211; Sleepover</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I returned home through the sparse flashing streetlights and lay down on the sofa to relax.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I heard there would be karaoke at the after-party, but as expected, I declined.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps because I was invited by Ayaka, everyone's eyes on me were warm, but that is not the same thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After that, several circle members called by Ayaka and Natsuki enlivened the table, and the drinking party turned out to be a good time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps it was because I was so worked up from drinking that I didn't have to worry about bothering them. The speed at which we get to know each other over drinks is very fast.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm almost done washing the dishes. You have accumulated so much."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason Shinohara is still inside his home, even though I sent him home, is because he was killing time at a nearby convenience store.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seems that today was just a day when various magazines were releasing new issues, and the time passed quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While Shinohara is washing the dishes, I am relaxing, but my head is getting heavier as time goes by, perhaps because I am getting drunk.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Finally, there was a sign that Shinohara was leaving the kitchen, and I opened one eye thinly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Come on!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I heard a nice sound on my cheeks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I felt a hiyari palm and knew that Shinohara had placed his hand vigorously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not in my right frame of mind. Usually, senpai would yell at you, here."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara rubbed my cheek and relaxed her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Drunk."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You'll know it when you see it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I turned my face away, but Shinohara's hand never left mine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I felt a presence approaching, so Shinohara must be right beside me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My one eye was closed before I knew it, and I thought to myself that I was really drunk with my heavy head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had just had such a conversation with Reina earlier, but I didn't have to think about it when I felt Shinohara's cold palm directly on my hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... feels good."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, yes. That's because I was washing dishes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Come to think of it, Shinohara must not have eaten here today. That means he washed only my dishes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I guess they saw me drunk and realized that I would probably neglect my chores again today, so they washed the dishes for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I thanked him, Shinohara blew up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He said, "It's always like this. If you're going to say it, say it on a regular basis."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Usually it's in lieu of rent. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm just going to say, "Okay, you've got it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara lightly pinched his cheek and lightly stroked the place where he pinched again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A few seconds of silence ensues. It is not awkward, but the silence is rather pleasant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You staying? Today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I couldn't help but say so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Was he drunk or did he want to stay home the whole time?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Hearing my suggestion, Shinohara shows a surprised expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I didn't bring a change of clothes. If you don't mind."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It did not take long for Shinohara to respond.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I mean, it's just that up until now we've been kicking people out just before the last train."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara complains while rummaging through his wardrobe.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was the one who told them to look for clothes they could use, but the sight of the clothes piling up as fast as they could was fidgety.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps noticing this state of affairs, Shinohara raised the corners of his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I just took it out of the box. They had been put in there in a messy state, so I just took them out while I was at it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What the fuck?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I turn over with relief. Then you can have it scattered as much as you want.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'd rather you scatter to your heart's content and organize the contents of the wardrobe for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I feel like an asshole, but my body, weighed down by alcohol, does not listen to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai, can I borrow this or something?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just after I turned over, I was approached and reluctantly rolled over again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara's fingers were picking at a jersey I used to wear in basketball circle. I readily agreed, thinking it would make a good substitute for a nightgown.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said, "Fine. Sorry, I don't have any women's stuff."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If there were, it would be a don't-do."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reply reaffirms in my mind that all of Reina's belongings must surely be gone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had not organized the contents of the wardrobe since our breakup, so I was a little anxious, but judging from Shinohara's appearance, she seemed to be doing okay.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I often look in the closet, but rarely look in the wardrobe, so my memory is hazy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't have a girlfriend, do I? I'm staying here today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not here right now. I'm fine."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps reacting to the implied word "now," Shinohara stopped folding laundry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I never even told Shinohara that I had a girlfriend until recently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had told him about my views on my own love life, but I had never told him anything about what happened with Reina.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was something I wanted to avoid as much as possible to talk about Reina to people I knew nothing about.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But now, after the encounter with Reina and the phone call, the memories of those days are about to come vividly to the surface again. I was finding it a little hard to hold on to them alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps it was this feeling that made me say things in an implicit way. Perhaps I subconsciously wanted Shinohara to notice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"We recently split up."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had to tell people who knew nothing about Reina's existence. That alone required a lot of effort on my part.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it had not been the day of Reina's call, and if it had not been Shinohara on the other end, I would never have told a stranger about Reina. Today was a special day when those conditions came together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How long have you been together?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara asked without putting any effort into it, as if he was folding clothes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Maybe a year."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Heh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"A year is quite a long time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's normal. It's normal."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In high school, many couples broke up after three months or even as early as a month, but in college, that was a bit early.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">One year seemed to be quite average.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Shinohara's cheeks puffed out when she heard my response.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was three months old."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, you are."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ah! Disdain!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, no, I don't mean anything else."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He turns over and tries to get as far away from the voices that are coming down on him as possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Talking about Reina. That was enough to lighten my heart somewhat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And I am relieved that it was not pursued as much as I had expected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It can be hard to hold it all together. But as we talked, it seemed to me that remembering this and that in the past was more painful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps my relief turned my drunkenness even further, but I was feeling furiously sleepy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I let go of my consciousness without fighting sleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I slowly opened my heavy eyelids at the sound of the bathroom door closing. The heaviness in my head from the alcohol was somewhat better, but I still couldn't bring myself to get up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I pull out my phone and check the time, it is 2 am. I must have slept for two hours.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Did I wake you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I shifted my position toward the voice coming from the hallway and saw Shinohara in my jersey with an apologetic look on his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The scent of bathwater wafts from the hallway, and I wonder why it smells so good, even though it is supposed to be the same shampoo.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was asleep."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know. Didn't you hear what I just said?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I got up, I felt even more sluggish.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I think I had a long dream for the short amount of sleep I had. People are said to remember the dreams they had just before waking up from sleep, so sleep duration may have nothing to do with it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you okay? You should drink some water."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't want it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Move to the bed and lie down to collapse.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For Shinohara to wear his own clothes as a nightgown would be a situation that would make the average boy's heart flutter. In front of a man who has been drinking, Shinohara is a little vulnerable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, such a joyful situation seemed no match for the physical sluggishness that would remain even tomorrow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara seems a little frustrated by the unresponsiveness of the clothes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai, do you have any reaction or anything?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know if I should say this, but..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's a very extravagant situation for such a pretty girl to be wearing a man's clothes, right? I know, I know, it's a treat, good night."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then he covered his face with a comforter to prevent light from entering his vision. However, the comforter was quickly pulled off.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm dazzling, I'm melting. I'm actually a vampire..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you're a vampire, you're fine at this time of night. Don't give me crap."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara sniffed and put a hiyari (a cold object) on my forehead.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What the hell?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's a drink for hangovers. I just went to a convenience store and bought it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's dangerous, a girl at this hour."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You never let me stay over until now, even when it was late. What are you talking about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara laughed and placed the pills beside me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He drinks it all up in one gulp to prevent a hangover, and then releases the empty container into the trash.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Damn bitter."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's the best medicine that comes with the worst medicine."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're right. Thanks."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, no."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is where I see Shinohara's face for the first time. I had missed it because I had been under the impression that she was wearing my jersey, but now Shinohara is wearing no makeup and no face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was another reason for the delay in noticing this, besides being distracted by my jersey.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're pretty cute without makeup, too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hundred points for senpai. The way you praise me, the girls will be delighted."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I laugh at Shinohara, who gives a vigorous thumbs up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's a zero answer to the question?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's just that you're prettier without makeup."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The heart of it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know what I'm doing makeup for if people say I'm prettier without makeup. I'm wearing makeup to look as pretty as possible."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From the heat he put into his words, he had probably been told this several times. I wasn't aware of it, but from Shinohara's point of view, my compliment was the right one.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sometimes there are people who say, You look prettier without makeup when you go to a camp or something! You know, the ones who say, "You look prettier without makeup! They don't understand! You don't understand!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, how about you, Shinohara? Take it easy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"We pay a lot of money to buy all kinds of makeup! And then..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara's mouth is pressed with his hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He writhed in agony, but when I pointed to the clock, he huffed and shut up and let go of my hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry. I was distraught at midnight."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you emotionally unstable?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's how counterproductive the word is."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, yes, I'm going to bed."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was originally right, so it's none of my business. And this was the second time I heard this story.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I recall Ayaka saying the exact same thing a year ago. The person who praised her may have thought it was the best compliment, but behind the scenes, she was slammed like this. This is a good example of the fact that a compliment is meaningless unless the words are chosen carefully.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If he could tell that you were trying to compliment him, then forgive him."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I unintentionally defended the man, Shinohara laughed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not mad at you. I just got a little heated."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, yes. Well, don't be offended."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It depends on the person. If it's senior, I don't mind."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm glad you're here. Glad to hear it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you're going to act like that, I won't cook dinner tomorrow."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That would be a problem. Probably my body will still be somewhat heavy after I wake up in the morning, so I need to have the dishes done.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Moving in the morning is a hassle, even if you've had a hangover-preventing drink.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry. I'm sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's cash, and I hate it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara sniffled and threw herself onto the couch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't you have to take care of your skin or something?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I did the bare minimum, but I could only find men's stuff in the bathroom. Have you ever really had a girlfriend?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It would be a bad one if my ex-girlfriend left it behind. I made her take back all her personal belongings."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have lotion and such, but no pack to soak it in. I am not so conscious of beauty, but I don't have a pack to soak it in. I wash my face, but I always take proper care of my face afterwards.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara yawns, reaches over from the sofa, takes a toweling blanket, and wraps herself in it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, where's the hair dryer?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm just going to let it dry naturally today. The dryer is too noisy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In a manner of speaking, he must have been concerned about the adjoining room. It didn't seem like the kind of thing that would come from someone who had just spoken so loudly, but I suppose I should commend him for his thoughtfulness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I have good news for you, My hair dryer is a high-spec one that makes almost no sound."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Seriously?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Majestic."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara jumps up and walks back to the washroom. It is said that hair is a woman's life. Shinohara must have resisted the damaging natural drying of her hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though it is an apartment, the walls are rather thick, so there is no need to be overly concerned.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The clear sound came from the bathroom, and I was glad I had bought a higher-end hair dryer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Come to think of it, I stepped into the bathroom, thinking that she wouldn't know where the lotion was.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I opened the door, Shinohara had placed her phone on the washroom stand and was running a video while she ran the wind from the hair dryer through her hair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sight of her drying her hair in a distracted outfit is a thumping sight.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I opened the top shelf and found lotion. You didn't use it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He says in a flat tone so as not to let them know how he feels.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wow, senpai. You scared me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara's shoulders shook as if horrified.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's the Ox's time, so please come in a little more knowingly."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You can't have ghosts?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know if there are people who are okay with ghosts. I understand if you don't believe in ghosts, but I don't think there is anyone who is okay with ghosts."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I agree, but I felt a little mischievous when I saw Shinohara's reluctance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm psychic, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What, are you serious?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara turns off the hair dryer and looks up at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Have you finished drying your hair or is it too much for you?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I hid it, though. So if there were people like that behind me, I would know."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're drunk at ......, aren't you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara has a subtle look of disbelief. There is no doubt that he is drunk, but if he is going to make a joke anyway, we want him to believe us first.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I started talking, thinking of an article I had read on the Internet.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was in the third grade at a public bathhouse in my neighborhood.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Gib! I'm going to bed!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara ran out of the bathroom, jumped into my bed, and wrapped herself in the quilt over her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was not reluctant to let him use my bed since he was my guest, but he must not be very good at ghost stories if he jumped into bed without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're too quick to give, even if you do ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I let out a sigh, and Shinohara peeked out from the quilt.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Big eyes staring at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can't do it. I really can't. If you say it again, I really won't cook for you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said, "Okay, sorry, sorry. I was definitely drunk."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, there are no such things as ghosts. People in the past got it wrong with the simulacra phenomenon. It's a phenomenon where if you just see three dots, you recognize them as faces. That's what ghosts are!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Turning my back on Shinohara's insistence, I pull out a futon from the closet. When I started living alone, I bought two futons. I thought they would be useful when I got a girlfriend or had a friend over for the night, but these futons are relatively rarely used.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rena stayed over occasionally, but I rarely let my friends stay at my house. I don't like to let people stay at my house much.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka knows this too, so she never entered my house except for lunch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, who always comes in and out of the house, is an anomaly. There must be something that makes it tolerable, but I didn't know what it was.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Maybe we are simply compatible as people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll help you. I'll help you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I was holding the futon, Shinohara stood up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, thanks. It's my own."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What, am I in bed?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The beds there are better."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If I'm going to let them stay the night, I want them to sleep in a place that's as nice as possible. As an older person, I sometimes want to look good.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The surprised look on Shinohara's face satisfied me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He jumped into my bed only to escape from the ghost story, and he didn't really intend to sleep there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You can change the sheets."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, it will be hard to do laundry, and I'm totally fine with it as is. But are you sure?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's okay. It's not like it's going to decrease."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I lay down the futon and get under the covers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The bed with Shinohara and my futon are not too far apart, but this distance is the limit for a one-room apartment where one lives alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When the lights went out, most of the one room was covered in shadows. A ray of moonlight leaking through a gap in the curtains crossed the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Good night."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I told him, I felt Shinohara smiling at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, good night."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I closed my eyes, I could hear Shinohara moving slightly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In the same way, the other side will be able to feel my every move.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The space where silence descended made me keenly aware that I was alone with Shinohara, and I strained my closed eyelids.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai, aren't you far away?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I open my eyelids to the muffled sound of Shinohara's voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The voice, which must have leaked out of the quilt, seemed strangely distant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Not really. They're not even two meters apart."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I replied, my voice rose a little. Was it the alcohol in my throat, or was it nerves from the unfamiliar situation?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's pathetic that I'm nervous now, but I'm sure I'm getting a different feeling than when I sleep with her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After waiting for a while, there was no response from Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The hands of the clock, making a faint sound in the quiet space, echoed disgustingly, and he regretted that he should have used an electronic clock.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If she has already gone to bed, she is a brazen woman.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter how much we trust them, they are still a bit vulnerable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it is because it is late at night that I have such thoughts, I want to go to sleep as soon as possible, but the more I try to sleep, the clearer my mind becomes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I opened my eyelids and looked up at the ceiling resentfully.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I can't sleep."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No reply came back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shinohara?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He called out one last time. If there was no response, I considered it unavoidable to fiddle with my phone. It was obvious that it would make me extra bleary-eyed, which is something I would like to avoid if possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But fortunately, the sound of sheets rustling could be heard from the direction where Shinohara was.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was about to ...... sleep."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wow. Sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Pulled back from the world of sleep, Shinohara's voice is more gravelly than usual, and he apologizes involuntarily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara squirmed for a while, but eventually calmed down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I am not sure if he is sleeping, since I can't hear him breathing, but now I feel that I can't bear to wake him up for my own reasons, so I let out a small breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I give up and take my phone out of my pocket.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What about ......?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I sounded dumb, not understanding what Shinohara said, which I heard unexpectedly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Fine, senpai in bed, too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Finally understanding Shinohara's point, he turned in the opposite direction where Shinohara was.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can't share a bed with someone I'm not dating."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That creed is cool, though. Then please go to bed."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can't sleep."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then why don't you just come?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I felt Shinohara raise his upper body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although it is dark, I can feel Shinohara's eyes on my back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Normally, I would have refused without even thinking about it, but there was a reason for my hesitation. I am not accustomed to sleeping on the guest futon I sleep on, so it is difficult for me to fall asleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...... that's as close to an excuse as you can get. There is such an irresistible allure to Shinohara's invitation that such an excuse involuntarily crosses one's mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Normally, I would have brushed it off lightly, but the lustrous voice coming from the darkness rang in my ears.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I get up from the futon and manage to reach the bed with little visibility.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Here you go."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara could see me, so he pulled his hand away and urged me next to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I sit down on the bed, I can feel that Shinohara's scent is close to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A sweet scent tickled my nostrils, not unlike my own bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm going to move closer to the wall. Please don't kick me while I'm sleeping."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not such a bad sleeper."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I felt Shinohara smiling at me as I argued back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Finally, my eyes became accustomed and I could make out Shinohara's face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm okay with that."</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqrwQHZbxqA3QGVyXvrg24don9QKmd88U5-20aLOmjssJCSBgHxe8ciDrbOX1LssXqqij8e8td14jTJbRVZZLSLozwbBAPLq-PUCXG0ZIDLTgjlAf5AmkVik_V3TELl_sJ5Mb_fEdBwHMQMBl0lwo1gvg9DE0-ngo4XTjLIXj48hZxn7X6yYapEMKO/s800/00026.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhqrwQHZbxqA3QGVyXvrg24don9QKmd88U5-20aLOmjssJCSBgHxe8ciDrbOX1LssXqqij8e8td14jTJbRVZZLSLozwbBAPLq-PUCXG0ZIDLTgjlAf5AmkVik_V3TELl_sJ5Mb_fEdBwHMQMBl0lwo1gvg9DE0-ngo4XTjLIXj48hZxn7X6yYapEMKO/s16000/00026.jpeg" /></a></div><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><br /></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara shifts her hips and moves to the wall and rests her head on a pillow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I placed the pillow I had brought next to me, too, and slowly shifted my position.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although his back is turned to Shinohara, he can feel a single breath of air only a few inches away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought this would make it even more difficult to sleep, but I didn't care about that now that I was feeling somewhat content.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The hands of the clock are not heard for some time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sound of the pillow and hair rubbing against each other stopped, and we both remained silent for a long time. The lack of breathing indicates that Shinohara is not yet asleep.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I opened my eyes and gazed into the empty darkness, Shinohara finally spoke up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're very solid, senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What are you firm about? The words were vague, but I knew what they meant to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"......A really solid guy wouldn't let a girl he's not dating stay over at his house."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Indeed."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't be so convinced."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A few light words and the tension dissipates somewhat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seems to have started raining.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You can hear the rain knocking on the ground as it begins to fall at midnight.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Unable to sleep, I stared at the empty space. Just as I felt my eyes getting used to the darkness, I felt the light around me slowly diminishing. Are the clouds hanging over the moon?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For a while I kept my eyes open, but eventually I got tired of that too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why did you break up with your ex-girlfriend?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I regretted a bit what I told Shinohara about having an ex-girlfriend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Reina is now a person of the past.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If we had not met again at the mall. If I hadn't received a phone call.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was supposed to sink to the bottom of my memory and eventually wear off. I hate the fact that talking to Shinohara will make me aware of Reina again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And it's a waste of time and effort to spend on a matter that will never be resolved.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Now that I was starting to sober up, I was beginning to think so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So I have nothing to say to Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can tell from my seniors that they don't like to talk about such in-depth topics. That's why I'm glad you told me, even if it was just because you were drinking."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you happy? Why not?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He repeats in a tone as if to say, That's a funny thing to say. But I don't know why, so I silently urge him to answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I knew they trusted me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Trust, and recite it in your mind. To trust and rely on. I know what it means, but I have to think about it a little because it wasn't something I consciously said or did.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">To be honest, I didn't mean to do that at all. It just became a little hard for me to hold it alone and it just leaked out of the levee broken by alcohol.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I got to see a side of my seniors that they don't show to other people."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The word that comes to mind is Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The fact that I know a side of Ayaka that not everyone knows is a sign of trust. I would be lying if I said I did not feel happy about that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That being said, I definitely trusted Shinohara, too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I affirmed Shinohara's interpretation that showing a side of oneself that one does not show to others is a sign of trust.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Maybe."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I responded, I felt Shinohara raise her upper body and look down at me. I could see her face, which was slightly visible, staring straight down at me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I thought maybe I shouldn't mention it so much earlier. I was still curious."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The tone of his voice was more serious than usual, and I guessed what the question was about.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Did something happen with your ex-girlfriend today?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I pressed on, the sound of the pattering rain beating against the window became more pronounced. The rain must have been very cold as it began to fall from the winter night sky.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The moonlight that had been shining in just a few moments ago had vanished, perhaps obscured by clouds, and Shinohara's expression, which had been slightly visible just a few moments ago, could no longer be seen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And surely this silence will be the answer for Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm still not trustworthy, am I?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's not fair. It's one thing to trust me, it's another to talk to me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't want to talk about it because I want to forget about Reina. I don't want to talk about it because I want to forget about Rena and I don't think it will lead to anything. I don't want to talk about it because it's a problem that can be solved by my mindset, not because I don't trust Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It has nothing to do with this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If I didn't trust you in the first place, I wouldn't let you stay at my house."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When he didn't respond, I continued speaking to the ceiling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You tell people you trust anything? Like me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is it an egotistical metaphor?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But today, after many days of going home like this, and finally sleeping under the same roof. I thought that this did not mean that they did not trust me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I know that this is a one-sided and optimistic observation, but I am relieved that Shinohara does not seem to object to it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... Indeed, I did. So did I."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Slowly, Shinohara spun his words as if chewing them over.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's one thing to trust them, it's another thing to step in and talk about it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When he said this in a convincing manner, Shinohara laid his upper body down again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I couldn't see him, but I somehow knew he had his back to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm glad to know. I knew it was true for everyone."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know about the rest of you, just me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sure we all do. I'm sure I am too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara let out a small breath and continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There are things I don't want to say, even to my senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Is it with Ayaka? Or is it something related to Ayaka? Or something completely different and different.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I realized that by speculating in this way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The desire to have someone talk to you because of your consideration for them. This is exactly the feeling that Shinohara had just had.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Me...decided."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll make my senpai like me even more."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was taken aback by the abrupt declaration.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you talking about all of a sudden?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I want to have a relationship with my seniors so that they naturally want to talk to me. I want to have a relationship with my seniors so that they naturally want to talk to me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I feel Shinohara turn toward me again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This time, they are so close that you can feel their breath.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Good night, senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara's hand slightly touched my back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A discreet embrace. The soft touch. The smell of shampoo wafting from her neck tickles my nostrils.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There was a certain warmth there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The embrace continued for a while, but eventually Shinohara untied her hands from around my waist.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was so excited. I was thrilled."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm the one who started all this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He shoots out strong words so as not to let the excitement in his chest be noticed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Because. It was my first time..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... what?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't tell anyone!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara takes the quilt from me and wraps herself in it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, it's cold! Give it back!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara laughed and buried his face in the quilt.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had no choice but to pull a blanket from the futon I was originally going to sleep on and wrap myself in it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From today onward, Shinohara will be intervening in my daily life even more.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I've only known Shinohara for a month.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But after only a month, Shinohara has already become so integrated into my daily life that I cannot separate it from my consciousness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was even a little excited to think that my relationship with Shinohara would deepen even further in the future.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, good night."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No reply.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can hear the sound of his sleeping breath coming from a few centimeters away from me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Damn, you only sleep for a second."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I laughed and distanced myself a little from Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Today, I won't have to remember the past anymore.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I closed my eyes, thinking about my new normal.</span></p>
