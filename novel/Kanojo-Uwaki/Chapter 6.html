<h3>Chapter 6 &#8211; Examination</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The next day, Ayaka and I were killing time in the smoking area of the university for an empty class.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since it is the second semester of the second year, there are a few free periods in the timetable. It is a privilege of university students to be able to make free time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was enjoying such blissful free time, but now I was concerned that Ayaka next to me was acting differently than usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka is leaning against the wall with her arms folded tightly, which creates a somewhat unapproachable atmosphere.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She was a little difficult to talk to because of her beauty. If I had not known Ayaka, I would have left the place quickly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, aren't you in a bit of a bad mood today? Aren't you in a bit of a bad mood today?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Nah, it's normal."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"This is not normal, at least from my point of view. How's that for convincing? I've known you for many years, and I can tell you..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ugh."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The joke, intended to lighten the mood, was never finished and morphed into an apology.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sure you'll be able to manage that vibe by the time you get to your next lecture. You're selling yourself as a character who can make friends with anyone."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not selling it on ......, but yes, I'll be careful. But yes, I'll be careful. Thanks."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka thanked him honestly and started fiddling with her phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can tell from the movement of his fingers that he is playing some sort of mini-game, but he has no feeling in his fingers at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The game was soon over, and Ayaka asked the question again without thinking as she repeatedly retried.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What happened?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka throws her gaze at me, but quickly returns it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This time Ayaka is not denying that something happened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After all, something must have happened to put Ayaka in a bad mood.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't know if that was last night or if it was about something else.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A normal friend would stop asking questions at this point, but this is Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I decided to ask a few more questions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Tell me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You have no delicacy, you know that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I left that stuff in my mother's belly."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Go back and start over from the fertilized egg."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka pishly says and walks out of the smoking area.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had no choice but to push my cigarette, which was still more than half full, into the ashtray and followed Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Bad."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not mad. Either way, my lecture starts in twenty minutes.".</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're not the kind of character to walk into a lecture hall and take a seat that far in advance."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Except before a test, that's for sure."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka enters the school building without stopping her steps and presses the elevator button.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When we entered the elevator, Ayaka and I were the only humans in the space.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The elevators at the university are relatively spacious and fast going up and down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But for some seconds you are trapped in a sealed space, and the elevator space has a slight flickering smell of the cigarette you just smoked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You've got to stop smoking."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka said in a strong tone, as if to say, "This is the right time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why not? It's not up to me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The words that came out of the bushes made my mouth twitch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's not good for you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I have. Smoking together is a great way to have close conversations with seniors."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is true that the cigarettes will cause extra expenses, so it would be better to stop if you are thinking about your wallet, which is not flattering to the wealthy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I can understand that there are many disadvantages, considering the fact that it is harmful to the body.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But when I broke up with Rena Aisaka, it calmed me down, albeit a little, and as I said earlier, I can use it to keep up with my seniors.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are also quite a few advantages.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The elevator doors open and we arrive at the fourth floor where the lecture hall is located.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As the two of us were somehow watching the elevator display going down to the first floor, Ayaka unexpectedly opened her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, let's just say it doesn't look good on you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... seriously?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You don't look good with a cigarette, Yuta Hasegawa."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't say it twice!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I would have refused if they said it was bad for me, but if they said it didn't suit me, that was a different story.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I am not interested in fashion to the extent of buying brand-name products, but I am still interested to the extent of an average college student.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The most damaging thing was being told that it didn't look good on me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This sounds like I need to seriously consider quitting smoking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think even Ms. Shinohara doesn't like cigarettes. There are a lot of girls who don't like cigarettes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I don't smoke at home. I don't think I've ever smoked in front of Shinohara."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You make it sound like she's going to be home all the time."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I muttered in my mind to Ayaka, who sounded dumbfounded, "I've been here a long time lately.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So why are you in a bad mood?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I asked again, Ayaka frowned, "Again? Ayaka frowned.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You're not so stubborn," he said. It's pretty rare for someone to pester me without fear that I won't like it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you say so yourself, you're just being a jerk. It's just because I care about you. Besides, it's you and me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We have known each other for four or five years now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although they are far from lovers, it is still a special relationship.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka did not dispute the statement and exhaled as if in contemplation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's before the test. I'm just in a temper."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, are you in trouble this time?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't be silly, it's business as usual. I'm not with you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're a man of a word or two, you are!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I told her that I was going to do it, Ayaka's cheeks relaxed for the first time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I could tell you, but I'd rather have a café au lait from that vending machine over there."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, so what?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka does not answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">They just send their eyes to the vending machine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Reluctantly, I take out my wallet and buy a warm café au lait.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka hurriedly caught the café au lait as it fell with a clatter and was released.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't throw me under the bus again."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's okay, I got it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmph. Thanks."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka sniffs, opens the can, and proceeds to slurp and drink.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A college girl slurping down a hot café au lait was something of an interesting picture.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Too many people ask me to show them my notes when I don't even attend their regular classes. And they don't get anything in return."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka finally told the reason for her bad mood as she threw the café au lait, which she had downed in one gulp, into the trash.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Money and all that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I said it, I knew Ayaka would not have such thoughts. Sure enough, she stabs me with a gaze like an arrow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't need it. I've been told several times before, but they all offer me 5,000 yen or so. If you convert it to an hourly wage, it's really nothing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka's mouth never stops talking, as if she is ready to tell everything once she starts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not sure how much I can ask for, but I'd like to know. If you're going to ask someone to do something for you, you should do it in exchange. That's why they don't take you seriously."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The words suggest that the people Ayaka is referring to are men.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if they tried to refuse, it would be difficult because they are ostensibly beautiful in all directions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't really remember Ayaka playing all sides in high school, so this is a new heartache for her after college.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But one problem.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I spend the same amount of time in class as you do, so why should I give my notes to someone who has nothing to gain from them?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">...... means I'm borrowing notes from Ayaka all over the place too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It sounds good to say that I am weak in the morning, but I just had a self-defeating life and often did not attend lectures.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Each time, he would borrow notes from Ayaka, and even when he went to lectures, he would borrow Ayaka's notes because he could learn more from her notes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I hardly remember doing the equivalent exchange that Ayaka mentioned.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I feel sorry all at once.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"......That's the thing. I knew it in my head, but when you actually said it like this, I was really sorry. I'm sorry. No, seriously, I'm sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I fearfully apologized, Ayaka's eyes fluttered.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Nothing. You don't mind, do you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Huh?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka laughs, "Don't apologize all of a sudden.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why am I good?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not getting anything out of it. It's not like I'm getting something out of it by giving it to you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I coughed involuntarily as I tried to understand exactly what it meant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do you mean?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You mean I owe you a favor and I'm going to use you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka grins and goes into the lecture hall first.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The joke was so bad that I vowed never to buy him a drink again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At my university, it's relatively easy to get credits in the liberal arts, except for law school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No lecture has a failure rate higher than 80%, and more than half of the students always get credit for their work.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My understanding is that as long as you attend, you can do the rest as long as you study properly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And today's test is the last test of the term.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was allowed to copy Ayaka's beautifully put together notes and stayed up all night to cover a wide range of topics.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although the course does not allow students to bring their own notebooks, I am not too worried about losing credits thanks to the all-nighters.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The test starts in twenty minutes, but at this rate we won't have to cram until the last minute.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Clear off the desk and put only writing utensils on it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then I felt someone peeking at me and looked up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"May I sit next to you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A student, probably the same age as me, talks to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Here you go."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The stranger, a male student, bowed his head lightly and began to prepare for the test.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In high school, I never used honorifics if I judged the other person to be my age, even if I didn't know them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is one of the things that has changed since I entered college.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I looked around because I had nothing left to do, I saw Ayaka sitting on the opposite side of the room, engaged in a problem-solving contest with her friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since it is on the other side, I can't even make out their expressions.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">So they have known each other long enough to be able to determine that it is Ayaka just by her gestures.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are various types of lecture halls in universities, but the one I'm in right now is one of the larger ones.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Each of the 15 rows of long desks at the front and rear, and 20 rows on either side, can accommodate three students.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">During tests, only two people can sit down to prevent cheating, but this does not prevent students from sitting down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The zany lecture hall gradually quieted as the professor entered, and test papers were handed out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I looked closely to see if the problem was transparent from the back, there seemed to be no symbol problem.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because the string that seems to be the problem is divided into only two parts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ugh. ......."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I agree wholeheartedly in my mind to the murmurings I hear from next door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If there are only two, it is surely a question that must be discussed in considerable detail. Good-bye to the student who has memorized them shallowly and broadly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sound of a bell plays, and I grab my pen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Let the testing begin.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's done."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I managed to write the first question down. The second question, however, was on a subject that had been successfully erased from my brain, and my pen was at its limit after four lines.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Four lines for an argument that would have at least 20 lines.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[You are asked the question, "What did you do during this winter vacation? Please describe in detail what you enjoyed the most and what foods you enjoyed the most during the winter vacation.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[My answer to that question is probably, 'I'm planning to go to a cafe today.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was so devastating that I am not even sure of the purpose of the problem.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is unlikely that partial points can be expected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka looked at me in a somber mood even though I had just been released from the test, and she sounded dismayed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You didn't solve that one? You marked some areas in your notebook where you might be asked to write an essay."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ha-ha-ha."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"......, it's okay you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka looks slightly taken back and throws in a few words of concern.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He then seemed to think a little and clapped his hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm having a party tomorrow to celebrate the completion of the test. You want to come too? You haven't been to a big party in a while, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... drinking party? Uh, certainly not one with a large group of people since I've been going to The Circle."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as Ayaka hears my response, she pulls out her phone and starts running her fingers over it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I've sent you an invitation to join. It's a relatively open circle, and I'm sure you'll have fun once you get a few drinks in you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I hadn't said I was going or anything yet, but Ayaka was acting too fast.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But this time I was a little more on board, too, and decided to thank him honestly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Three years."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hm."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka replied shortly and stretched widely.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, now we're free for a while, aren't we? Let's enjoy the long, long spring break."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know, I've got two months."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm going on a trip with my circle, and I'm quite looking forward to it. We're going on a trip with our circle, and I'm pretty excited about it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">'You were in more than one circle, weren't you? Which circles?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's an outdoor club."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, you're going to go climb a mountain?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I'm going to the hot springs and eating crab."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know you will!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Many people may think of outdoor clubs when they hear the word "outdoor club," such as mountain climbing, but in reality this is often not the case.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The majority of the circles are large groups of people who meet for drinks or take ordinary sightseeing trips.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm sure it varies from college to college, but at least at my college, multiple outdoor clubs are like that across the board.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I remember being astonished when I was a freshman because some clubs have an entry sheet or other selection process to get into the club.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Have you been going to the circle lately?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No, not at all."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm actually in a basketball club too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Circles are the quickest way to expand your circle of friends in college. Conversely, if you don't join a club, it is extremely difficult to expand your circle of friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why don't you get going? You liked that circle a lot."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, I liked it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Usually all they do is play games, and sometimes they practice seriously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I certainly liked it because it was comfortable for me, and I was able to relieve stress in moderation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I stopped going to such circles after I broke up with Rena Aisaka. In other words, I haven't been going for about two months now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The reason was that Reina was dating some of my acquaintances.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He really did not want to be pursued by such people about the cause of the breakup immediately after the affair.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But my mental state now is different from back then.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's about time I, too, got back to my normal routine.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think it's ....... I gotta go soon."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'd like to be able to do that. I'll take that as a distraction."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka raises the corner of her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm going to go to dinner with my friends from school. I'm going out to dinner with my friends from the faculty."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka returned to the lecture room, waving her hands in the air.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My undergraduate friends are probably waiting for me there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"......I guess I'll go with you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I feel that if I miss the timing of the end of the test, it will take time to go back to the circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said to my friend, 'I'm going to the circle for the first time in a long time!' I called my friend and said, "I'm going to the circle after a long time!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Nevertheless, I have never gone out to dinner with Ayaka's friends, although I am acquainted with them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If we see each other, we can talk a little, so if I wanted to go, I could go anytime, but I don't have a chance.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka is probably not too keen on mixing me in with the group.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If Ayaka was so inclined, she would have received one of her invitations by now. She would have immediately invited me to a party or a drinking party of her circle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wonder if that group would know a side of Ayaka that I don't know.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't know if there is such an aspect.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I just never heard of Ayaka before we met in high school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I am interested, but that is something I would never know about unless I had a chance to find out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I asked him about it, he often brushed me off.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I was thinking about this, the phone in my pocket trembled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Line from Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['Good job on the test! Where are you now?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Bad timing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since I have decided to go to the circle for the first time in a long time, I have no choice but to decline if it is an invitation to play.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">An incoming call from Shinohara appeared on the screen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a little hesitation, he answers the call.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Senior, good luck with your test!]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry, but I can't see you today. Sorry I can't see you today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Why is that?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm going to the circle today for the first time in a long time. So I'll give you a break today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I just turned down your offer of lunch, so I'm free until the evening. I just turned down your offer of lunch, so I'm free until the evening.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Does it mean that he turned down the invitation with the intention of having lunch with me?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then I almost thought that might be a little bad, but I stopped.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[No, that's for your own reasons.]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['Yes, it's for my convenience. And my seniors are kind enough to go out with me in these situations.']</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What the hell is that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['Do you know? People can be really kind when others tell them they are kind.']</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I guess I'm not human, then. See you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Wait a minute, I'll buy you a drink!]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was swayed by Shinohara's impatiently restraining seduction.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Again, students who live alone are not served food even if they go home and wait.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Do you cook for yourself, eat out, or buy a boxed lunch, etc.?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And since I don't cook, I'm left with only the more expensive option.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In other words, the ability to cut food costs is quite attractive.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even if it is by means of having a younger girl buy you a drink.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll be there. Meet me in front of the cafeteria on campus."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">["Hmmm, that's easy."]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With that one word, the call is disconnected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For a moment, I seriously considered letting go of my promise and leaving.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai, this way!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked around and saw Shinohara waving his hands wide.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking at the students passing by Shinohara, it is clear that she stands out from the crowd.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I let out a small gasp when I saw the group of men busily talking to each other as soon as they saw Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">They stand out simply because they have pretty faces, so please refrain from raising your voice in an unspecified crowd of people.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wish I could put myself in the shoes of those who are about to join us.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I call out to Shinohara, the group of men leave, talking disappointedly, "I knew you'd be there first, didn't I?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As expected, they were discussing whether to invite Shinohara to lunch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Does Shinohara not notice such a situation, or does he notice it and ignore it?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Good job on the test!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So much tension."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why are you so low in tension? It's the end of the test, remember?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I feel like complaining at least a word to Shinohara, who is driving normally without knowing our concern.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm tired after the test."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Upon hearing my response, Shinohara's cheeks puffed out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senior. A girl invites me to dinner and you look so annoyed, it's too extravagant."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara looked for my reaction with the words, "And it's me, after all. Shinohara looked for my reaction with the words, "And it's me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The expression on her face as she teased me, as if to say, "I'm so happy to be with you," was very similar to that of Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">They don't seem to get along with each other, so they don't talk about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you're sleepy, no matter how many guys you are, you can't get excited right away."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I guess that's just the way it is."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, who still looks dissatisfied, walks a little ahead of me, her mouth agape.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I have felt for some time, each expression on Shinohara's face tickles my male heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is not clear whether he is aware of this or not, but I wonder if Motosaka was also caught in the act.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was told at Christmas that even before I had a trial boyfriend named Motosaka, there was a constant stream of men confessing their love for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Numerous men were made to dance and then sunk. When I think of these sunken corpses, I sometimes feel compelled to take a step back from Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, this feeling never surfaces because Shinohara's aggressiveness does not allow it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara seemed to be searching on his smartphone for a restaurant close to the university.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There are cafeterias and cafés in the university, but they are crowded with people instead of being inexpensive. Shinohara once told me that if you want to have a relaxing meal, it is better to go to a regular restaurant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But there is one hurdle we want to cross before taking the meal.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shinohara, I'm not hungry yet."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thanks to little sleep from studying for the test, I had plenty of time in the morning.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thanks to this, I was able to eat more breakfast than usual, but it seems my stomach is not yet ready to accept lunch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What would you do, then? Should we just find the store first and walk around it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I still wish they'd let me go to The Circle now!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No. How am I supposed to fill my empty time?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as he said this, Shinohara's face lit up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have a bad feeling about this.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"All I have to do is follow the circle!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You idiot, stop!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The good thing about clubs is that, unlike club activities, they are less restrictive. Of course, the longer you are away from the club, the harder it is to go, but that is not a problem as long as you have established some relationships with others.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In other words, the members of the circle would not mind if I took Shinohara with me, but would rather rejoice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But the basketball club I'm about to go to, "start," is a place I haven't shown up at all since I broke up with Rena Aisaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is a little awkward to participate in an activity for the first time in a while when you are accompanied by a woman.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I, of course, would have to take care of my friends.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But my thoughts did not seem to reach Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm looking forward to seeing my seniors play basketball, I wonder how they will play."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I told him, "Stop expecting me to play. I can't make a super play."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After I say it, I'm ready.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It would be less troublesome to let them watch the game honestly than to refuse.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I prayed in my heart that I would not cause any strange misunderstandings.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, I borrowed your training clothes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Wrapped up in the unfamiliar smell, I call out to my friend next to me, who is tying the laces of his bash.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Dyeing his hair ash-gray, Mato Todo replied, "No, thanks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Todo is a friend I met at another circle's new party.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He was a friend I made in my early years at the university, and it was under Todo's influence that I started smoking cigarettes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He's a calm guy, easy to be around.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's been a long time since you came to the gym. Since she dumped you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I didn't get dumped, in case you were wondering."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I excused myself, Todo chuckled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What pride? I don't know, but that's how I feel."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You said, "I told you I was cheated on. That alone is lame, so just pretend I dumped you as a matter of fact."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't think getting dumped is lame in itself, but if a guy gets dumped for cheating on his wife, that's a different story.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It depends on the person, but at least my self-esteem is greatly damaged.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Todo, while stretching his body</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's lame to cheat on your wife," he said. It's a good thing I got to break up with a guy who cheats on me while I still can."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, it would have been more miserable if I had just stayed with him."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Todo smiled and picked up the ball.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Todo, with his well-defined face, is naturally popular.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But he seems to be single-minded about his girlfriend of two years and does not play with women.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The time I spent with Todo was pretty much my favorite time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You okay with the size of that bash?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Todo threw a glance at the bash I was wearing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The bash is loaned by the circle and is slightly larger.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But if you tighten the laces hard enough, it won't interfere with play.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm fine. It's just kind of lame."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, hey, what are you talking about when you're behind on your Circle fee? You should be thankful that you can use it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Oh, this bash is coming out of my circle fee?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, it's blood money that was squeezed out of us. Spend it well."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, sir."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Todo laughed at my response and spun the ball around on his finger.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"By the way, who is that girl standing at the entrance? She's looking at me like crazy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I followed Todo's gaze and saw Shinohara peering into the gymnasium.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The other circle members glanced at Shinohara and were clearly conspicuous.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When our eyes met, Shinohara jumped up and down and waved at us.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The other circle members all look surprised when they see me in the direction they are waving.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, shit, I brought him back."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that your new girlfriend?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, of course not."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Yeah, I don't think you're going to be making girlfriends anytime soon."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Todo narrowed his eyes as if to say he could see right through them.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I couldn't find the words to reply, so I clammed up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is not that I have no intention of having a girlfriend at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, there is no denying that they are reluctant to be in love.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If they cheat on you again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't want to have the feeling that all the time we have spent together seems like a waste.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In that sense, Todo's words are correct.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How are things going with Ayaka?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, he's not like that. He's different."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I said this, Todo rolled the ball he was spinning to a corner of the gymnasium.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yu always says that, but I don't really understand that logic. How can you not fall in love with someone so beautiful when you get along so well with her?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You don't like it when your friends are cute, either."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I have a girlfriend. Yuu is free right now."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Todo put his hand on my shoulder and returned his gaze to Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"But you're really cute. You didn't have such a cute junior at your part-time job, did you? How did you meet her, at a blind date?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I pondered the question for a bit before answering.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I just bumped into Santa at ......."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Leaving Todo in a daze, I ran toward the ex-Santa Claus.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For an all-nighter, my body was quite light.</span></p>
