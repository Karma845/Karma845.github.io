<h3>Chapter 3 &#8211; Winter Vacation for College Students</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have time in my college life anyway.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For someone like me, who spent most of my time in junior high and high school studying for entrance exams and club activities, and had very little free time, college life was surprisingly comfortable.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Looking back on my first year of college, I think it was the most fulfilling time of my life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">First circle, first time living alone, cute girlfriend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He maintained a modest academic record, and it was smooth sailing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But familiarity is a scary thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Gradually, the sense of happiness faded and the life became the norm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He went to the circle less frequently and cheated on his girlfriend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's a monthly thing, but you don't realize it until after you've lost it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I realized how big a part of the pieces I had filled my mind with.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">All I had left was the comfortable life of living alone, but even that is not that fulfilling these days.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Missed ......."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Touching the kitchen sink, I involuntarily let out such a sound.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had been skipping cleaning because it was too much of a hassle.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Wipe off the sloppy mucus on the rubber gloves with kitchen paper.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The benefits of living alone are different for everyone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A comfortable life without parental supervision. You can easily invite your friends or your girlfriend to your house.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But living alone like that has more disadvantages for me now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I threw my rubber gloves in the trash and paused to clean the sink.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Today I have to go to the university and submit my seminar report to my professor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is already three days past the submission deadline, but they tolerate me thanks to the relationship we have built up on a daily basis.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I am proud to say that the quality of the report is higher than usual for this reason, and I am sure the professor will be satisfied.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When you open the front door a few inches, cold air rushes in through the cracks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Samiii."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He mumbled and stepped outside.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Soft sunlight greeted me, as if the winter solstice had just passed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My college is just the right size.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The various spots are well dispersed, so there are few crowds except during the lunch break.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">They say it is difficult to even discover friends at a university where the grounds are too large, so I can say that my university is a relatively easy environment for communication.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The university, which offers such an environment, is now on winter break.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After finishing my report, I took a walk around the campus for a while, but I didn't see many of my friends or even fellow students.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was too lazy to go home for the rest of the day, because once I got home, I had to resume the interrupted cleaning process.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When he finds a vending machine, he takes out his wallet in a slow motion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At the very least, I want to rest and escape reality with a café au lait.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As soon as I put the coins into the slot, the coffee can fell with a clatter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I take out the coffee can that fell out, wondering.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, from behind me, I heard a familiar voice.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmmm. Thank you for your purchase, seniors."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I turned around, Mayu Shinohara, formerly known as Santa, was there.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She is just as cute as the first time I met her. It is rare to find a woman who looks so good in a Santa costume.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara accepts the coffee can from me and happily tries to open it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">How can you be so gleeful about drinking something that was bought with other people's money? Maybe it is because it was bought with other people's money.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why are you here? It's winter break today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Apparently not liking my reaction, Shinohara's cheeks puffed out after she cleared her throat.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senior, normally I'd be pretty happy to see you until winter break with me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"All right, look."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He points to the coin purse in the vending machine, as if he were old enough to do it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara seemed to have guessed my intention and pulled out a wallet from her bag. The brand-name item, which is popular among college girls, looks even better in Shinohara's hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't be crabby, that was my plan all along. What were you going to buy?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Cafe au lait."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara honestly pushed the button on the vending machine and took out a café au lait.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's cold, but is that what you wanted?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No problem, I like my cafe au lait cold."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You'll get cold."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara said a little worried, but I knew that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even in winter, the drinks I buy are always cold.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I opened the can and drank the café au lait, I could feel a nice sweetness spreading in my mouth. For me, it was a more comforting moment than smoking a cigarette.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you for the other day, senior."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's not a "hmm," it's not. It's about Yudo-senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What, that's it? They already thanked me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know, I said again."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara took his time opening the can and downed the coffee in one gulp.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ugh, bitter."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why did you drink ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although the label indicated that it was a low sugar, it apparently still did not suit Shinohara's taste buds.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara says, "I shouldn't have pushed the button at random," and throws the empty can into the trash.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The winter break trash cans were near empty and the cans were sucked in noiselessly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So, senpai. Now that we've had the good fortune of meeting like this, I'd like to make it up to you as soon as possible."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What about?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I stopped slurping my café au lait and furrowed my brow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't need that. It would be weird to make it up to me personally."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It should have been Ayaka who organized the blind date, and it would make sense for her to make it up to him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't think Ayaka would ever ask me to make it up to her about the matter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Shinohara shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's more like making it up to me. It's a way of repaying a favor. My senpai saved my life that day."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Me? I didn't do anything."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm the one who is indebted to you, so please keep your mouth shut."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're fucked up, you ......."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The only thing I did that day was to make my opinion known over the phone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I would be in trouble if I had to repay every favor for such a thing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Normally, I'd want them to just have me with them and make good on the debt, but seniors aren't really that kind of character,...... I guess."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He tried to wait for Shinohara, who proceeded to talk alone.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He said, "I, Santa, will grant one request of any kind to my seniors. Anything."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know what you're talking about."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I was about to say it, I see a dirty sink in my mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Something I have found particularly troublesome recently.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"&#9472;&#9472;Family Matters"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I said this, Shinohara scowled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It didn't take long before she blew up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, are you really coming home?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I reached the front door, I reminded Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even though the words were spoken in the heat of the moment, it does not change the fact that they invite girls to their rooms.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was going to make a joke out of it, but Shinohara agreed after a hearty laugh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">'When I'm done with my chores, I'm going to take a stroll through my senior's house!' with the words "I'm going to go for a walk at my senior's house after I'm done with my chores!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I have little to worry about, since everything that would make me uncomfortable is on my phone, but I still feel uncomfortable at the thought of someone I've known for less than a few days messing around with my home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why does the senior who asked you seem a little uncomfortable? You said you would go."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I still think you should cancel it. I'll just buy you a drink at the cafe there or something. On second thought, I'm good at housework."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Don't think too much about it now, we've come this far. It's cold. Please let me in as soon as possible."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara urges me with a smile that makes me think he is thinking of something evil.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is a sin that even these expressions look cute.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Eventually I couldn't refuse and unlocked the door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It had been a long time since I had invited someone to my home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hey, isn't your room pretty clean?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Upon entering the room, Shinohara sounds bored.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What kind of room did you imagine this clean?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The coat I wore yesterday is still in my room, and the bag of snacks I ate in the morning is still on the floor. In addition, there are prints everywhere, and the room is not in the best of cleanliness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was picturing a dump, so this is nothing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You came in here so prepared ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I am shocked that people associate such a trashy house with me. I don't pay special attention to my clothes, but I try to keep them clean, so I am even more shocked.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara stretches out her body in spite of my thoughts.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, I was free too. Then, I'll finish cleaning quickly."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After saying this, Shinohara put his coat on the bed and stood in front of the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">White skin can be seen through the rolled up arms.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What is it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, nothing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked away and released the jumper onto the bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There is a girl I just met in front of my kitchen at home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A month ago I would have never thought that was possible.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"If you leave clothes and stuff like that alone, they'll get wrinkled."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I'll do it myself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He stops Shinohara, who tries to pick up his clothes, and hangs his coat and jumper on a hanger.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When one is alone, one's home is indeed a place of peace and tranquility. However, this cannot be said when others enter the room.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara told me it was cleaner than I expected, but my usual room is much cleaner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Suddenly embarrassed by the messy room, I began to clean up anything I saw at random.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why do you live alone, senior?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why? Well, you know, a lot of things."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ha, it's a lot of things."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara replies absentmindedly, putting on rubber gloves.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Fortunately, the cleaning supplies were still on the kitchen counter, so Shinohara began cleaning up quickly and efficiently as it was.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why are you asking me all of a sudden?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The loud sound of water flowing from the faucet makes me strain my voice a little.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thanks to his efforts, Shinohara responded with the same timing as usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think it's easier to stay with my parents. Because wouldn't it be easier to stay at home? I'm sure there will be food when I get home. I don't think my senpai cooks, so I think that's important."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is easier to live at home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That's something I've been thinking about for a while, too.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Living alone is certainly freeing. But as a matter of course, you have to take care of yourself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was surprisingly time-consuming, and his mother was great, taking care of not only him but also his family.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"All right, that's it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What, are you done already?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I look into the sink, it is incomparably cleaner than before. Even the smallest stains have been removed, and it even looks shiny.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's amazing, in such a short time. It's like I lied that I thought it was such a hassle."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm used to it. I live alone, too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara nodded in satisfaction and tossed the rubber gloves into the trash.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then, let's cook lunch next time. You can relax."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's the matter, do you want me to buy you something? What's the matter, you want me to buy you something? I don't have any money."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You said, "You said I owe you, stop being weird and watch TV."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He sits up in bed with his back pressed against the bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara didn't seem to want me to help, and reminded me, "It's really relaxing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Did he see a future where I would try to help and ruin the dish? I'm not that bad of a cook, but if Shinohara doesn't want me to help, I can't blame her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I reach for the remote control and turn it on.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The program that was shown was a discussion on the issue of celebrity infidelity, which was completely unsuitable for me, as I have little interest in the entertainment industry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's the end of the year. What a load of crap.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I get fed up every time I watch a show that covers celebrity gossip. But from the point of view of someone who is interested in celebrities, I am sure they find it interesting.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My phone shook and I looked at the screen as if I was being sucked in.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The screen was notified of a message from Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[Let's play!]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Elementary school.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I almost shouted it out.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Normally I would give it a little time before replying, but now I have more time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I ran my fingers over the talk screen as I moved on to the talk screen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['You should at least tell me the time and place and what else you're going to do. I don't mind if we play.']</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">["Twenty-nine evenings, department stores, shopping!"]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[It's tomorrow!]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When he asks me out at the last minute, I guess he thinks I have nothing planned. It's even more frustrating that I'm right.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From there, the exchange with Ayaka continued for a while. All of it was nonsense, but it was a better use of my time than watching gossip shows that I had no interest in.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just as we were about to switch to the topic of the recent blind date, Shinohara called out to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you for waiting, senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I turned toward the voice, I saw that Shinohara was bringing in a platter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I put my phone in my pocket and sit up from the bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There were many sandwiches on the platter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was unintentionally excited. I had not been aware of it since I was only asked to cook by chance, but when I think about it, a home-cooked meal by a girl is not something that happens often to me as a single person.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In response to my reaction, Shinohara shrugged his shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I could only make something like this because I had everything on hand. Next time, senior, please make sure your refrigerator is a little fuller."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no. ...... looks so good."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Tuna, eggs, ham cabbage, and all the sandwich staples. It is amazing to think that something so solid came out of that rusty refrigerator.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm glad that's the case. If they were that happy with a sandwich, I wanted to make a more elaborate dish."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I want to reach for the sandwich on the desk right now, but first I need to say hello.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thank you for making it. Thanks for making it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Go ahead, it was worth it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara smiled shyly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The first time I saw this expression, I involuntarily stopped my hand to pick up the sandwich.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought, "Oh, ......, no. I thought you might have that look on your face."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After thinking about misrepresenting the situation, I revealed my feelings as they were.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought he would say, "That's creepy," but Shinohara's reaction was different.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What did you look like? Me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"He seemed embarrassed. No, it's embarrassing for me to tell him that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... I see."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then Shinohara put his index finger on his chin as if thinking about something.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'......, that's a weird one.'"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I muttered to myself and then chewed on my sandwich.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The thin layer of mayonnaise went very well with the ham and lettuce.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Lately, convenience store bento has been my staple food, so just the fact that someone made it for me makes it taste good.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara also seemed to have stopped thinking and decided to eat his sandwich, greeting it with a light tone of voice, "Itadakimasu!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It would seem strange to have dinner with someone at home, but Shinohara, with her coat off, is strangely at home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was wondering if you are a member of any clubs?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmm? I'm in a basketball circle, in case you're wondering."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I put "just in case" because the circle activities are held twice a week, whereas I participate in the activities only once a month or so.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was in club activities for a while after I entered university. I was in club activities for a while after I entered the university. I am interested in ordinary college students like my seniors."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're around, you're around."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are as good looking as Shinohara, people will come to you even if you do nothing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Shinohara shook his head vehemently, "Not at all!" and shook his head vigorously.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There are a lot of so-called "Parisians" around me. As you can see, I'm cute, so people like that come to me first."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The only person I know around Shinohara is Motosaka, but surely people like that would want to talk to Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As for the fact that he said he was cute and plainly said he was cute, it's too late for that, so I'm not going to get into it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm not paralyzed to the point where I think people like that are normal. I've just recently grown tired of such associations."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Is that why you went out with Motosaka?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, yes. As I said before, I was interested in the kind of romantic events that college students seem to do. I mean, please don't rehash this, I'm still sorry about this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara was chagrined and chewed a large portion of his sandwich.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He was a good eater. However, it seems that the sandwiches stuffed into his cheeks were over capacity, and Shinohara gulped down a glass of water as if in a panic.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You all right, man?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After rubbing his back, Shinohara seemed to gradually calm down.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara then remained silent for a few moments, but eventually opened his mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Do you have a girlfriend?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What the hell? I ain't here. If I was, I wouldn't let the girls in the room."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ho-ho, you're serious. It's rare nowadays, I tell you!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The teasing smile makes me think that even you had a problem with Motosaka because you don't like guys who cheat on you.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What are you thinking?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Things you don't like."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Gee, you're gonna tell him that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara frowned and reached out his arm to take the sandwich again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, as if realizing something, he stood up, bouncing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, no, it's a part-time job!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ha, you were before your part-time job!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If, after Santa, my current part-timer quits because of me, I'll have to pay him back again. Even so, there are probably not many part-time workers who can be made to quit for being late, but even so, there is nothing wrong with being on time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara also seemed to have a good sense of punctuality and started getting ready at high speed as soon as he noticed the time. Finally, he put on his coat and moved to the front door with a thump, forcing his feet into his boots. He seemed to be in quite a hurry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry about that."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'd be happy if you could say "Thank you for that, senpai. I'd be happy with a "Thank you for the food!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then Shinohara turned to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Here you go!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He is in a hurry, but he really wants to hear those words. Shinohara is standing there thumping his feet and waiting for me to say something.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Cold air is streaming in through the half-open door, but Shinohara shows no signs of being cold.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He's a cheerful guy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thanks for the food. Thank you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmph. You're welcome."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara nodded with satisfaction and turned himself around.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll be back then!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara opened the door and ran.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The sound of the stairs gradually becomes more distant and eventually disappears.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was standing in the doorway, ruminating over what I had just said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'll be back, huh?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm not a big fan of inviting strangers into my home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Still, I am sure that is what it is like to be told to come back and not feel bad about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It would be a good laugh if it were a beauty pageant."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even in the beauty bureau, wouldn't you be happy if you could get a home-cooked meal from such a pretty girl!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I could see the complaint that Shinohara might say, along with that devilish smile.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My senior's house was cleaner than I had expected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had imagined a more cluttered room, since the word "housework" is so often omitted in requests.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I opened the lid, there were only a few clothes and prints on the floor. When the senior left the scattered clothes and prints on the bed as if in a hurry, it was enough to make the senior's room look better, which made my visit here less meaningful.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It appears to have been vacuumed, and no noticeable stains were found on the exposed floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought it would be interesting if a senior who usually seems solid was someone who couldn't get anything done at home, but that didn't seem to happen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Frankly, it was a bit of a letdown, and I decided to make him lunch with a light heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There were only a few ingredients in the fridge, and I couldn't help but open my mouth. With such contents, does the senior think he can cook?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Having no choice, I decided to make a sandwich. Or rather, that was the only thing I could think of that I could make from those ingredients.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was a sandwich born from such a thought, but my senior ate it with great relish. Seeing him chewing his sandwich with a calm expression on his face, I felt a sense of enjoyment and said to him, "I'm glad that you enjoyed the sandwich.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll be back then!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Next time, I would like to serve them a well-cooked meal, not a simple sandwich.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I am somewhat unwilling to have such a simple sandwich positioned as my dish.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My mouth was loose as I walked to my part-time job.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The way I met my seniors is probably the worst.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It must be a very bad way to meet someone, one of the many ways to meet someone, to have flyers scattered all over the place while Santa is working.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Still, I quite like the time I spend talking to seniors.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seems that the way you meet has little to do with the relationship.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I saw the flashing lights and ran out.</span></p>
