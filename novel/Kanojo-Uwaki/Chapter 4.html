<h3>Chapter 4 &#8211; Closing of the Year</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">The next day, I was strolling around the department store with Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The department store interior has already changed from Christmas decor to New Year's decor. Red and white banners remind us of the end of the year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Department stores were busier than usual, as they were in the midst of year-end and New Year's bargains.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You shouldn't have come here today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're the one who invited me to ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka exhaled as she responded with a sigh of relief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Because you're the only one I can ask to help me with my luggage.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There are plenty of others out there who call people up just to carry their baggage."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I don't care."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Saying this, Ayaka walks to a cosmetics store.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka, who has a wide range of friendships, also knows that not many people can get away with not paying attention.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What would a normal man think about being called upon as a baggage handler by Ayaka, who is a genuine popular person in the faculty?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At least now I want to go home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm here today to discover a new Depakos. If it takes too long, I'll feel bad."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why doesn't that sorry feeling apply to me ......?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's right, we trust each other, don't we? Yeah, is that how it's going to be?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's not good, you idiot!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I hit Ayaka's buttocks with the paper bag containing the winter clothes she had just bought. There was a dull thud.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There it is! Where are you aiming at, you idiot?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shut up, you realize you deserved what was said!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka said, "Of course you're joking," and patted the site of the direct hit.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think it's more convenient nowadays to buy online, like Depakos. There might even be word of mouth."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Sometimes I wouldn't even have to carry a huge bag of groceries if only they would have bought it online.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And when shopping for money, people today are always concerned about word of mouth. I don't refer to word of mouth very often, but I am aware that I am in the minority.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Surprisingly, however, Ayaka shook her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There was a time when I used to refer to the cosmetics review sites," she said. But it seemed that there were giveaways that were offered on the condition of getting a high rating."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka combed her hair with her hand and showed it to me, then continued.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was almost distracted by her silky hair, but I managed to keep my attention on the chain.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I bought a treatment with a very high average rating, but it made my hair stiff and hard. I thought this was strange, and when I looked at the low ratings, everyone was saying that there were a lot of sakuras and that I shouldn't be fooled."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This is probably the downside of using word of mouth as a reference. It may be convenient, but it is also dangerous to trust blindly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It was a disaster."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes. Well, it is not limited to cosmetics. When I don't want to regret something, I want to see everything with my own eyes before making a decision."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka said casually, bending down and beginning to examine the eyeliner.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I think one of Ayaka's charms is that she has her own core, as she just said.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wonder how many people around Ayaka know this side of her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What a waste."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Yeah, you think so? I think it's a fair price, but I don't know. I still think it's a little high. What should I do?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It seems that ...... having a core of your own and shopping are two different things.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said, appropriately enough, "I think that's a good idea, that's it," and picked up the paper bag again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I feel a heavy weight on my shoulders.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Do you want me to hold it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Suddenly, Ayaka held out her hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He hesitated for a moment, then shook his head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't like to be made to carry luggage, but it is also embarrassing to walk next to Ayaka with this luggage.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are concerned about public perception, it would be a wiser decision to keep the baggage.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka raises the corner of her mouth, as if she knew the answer would come back to her.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll get something for you. I'll get you something in return."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I said this with a grudging smile, Ayaka nodded honestly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Can I buy you dinner?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, seriously."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't take it for granted. I'm getting your time and energy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then it's a completely different story. My dismayed thoughts turned around, and I suddenly began to enjoy shopping.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The change seemed to be felt by Ayaka, who giggled.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It can't be helped; for students living alone, the words "buy me dinner" are such a turn-on.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There is no reason to reject a proposal from someone your own age, let alone from someone younger.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm going to the back floor now, and you can pick out the restaurant you want to go to."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka stretches her body and waves her slender arms from side to side.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With a snap of her heels, Ayaka disappeared into the back floor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I watched it happen and then ran my fingers over my phone with glee.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Search and hit.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This restaurant is located in front of the station and has been on my mind for a long time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I made a reservation using the name Ayaka Mino.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I said I'd buy you anything, but why a mass diner ......?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka said in a tone of disbelief.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We visited an ordinary diner crowded with businessmen and students. It was my favorite restaurant, but Ayaka seemed to be dissatisfied with it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was going for something a little more fashionable."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's good. See, it looks good, oden?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I pressed the order button as I said it. A light ping-pong sound was heard, but it was drowned out by the hustle and bustle of the restaurant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was trying to win you over with some delicious food, since you don't seem to eat much."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"The reasons are disturbing!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You know for a fact that you don't eat well."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka then took the menu from me and started to flip through the pages as if she had given up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka, who had been looking at me blankly, gradually brightens her eyes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As the waiter came to the table, wading through the wandering customers in search of the restroom, Ayaka began to list her order at high speed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I want to show the current scene to Ayaka thirty seconds ago.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When the waiter brought a pot of oden a short time later, Ayaka screamed yellow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh my God, that's a lot of food!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Here it is, the one I've had my eye on for a while! For 2,000 yen, this quantity is too good a deal!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When a sufficient amount of oden to share is placed on the table with a thump, Ayaka takes a small plate to share.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, your share."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Three cheers."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I immediately started with my favorite dish, daikon radish, and the oden soup popped and spread in my mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka also relaxed her expression to the utmost and chewed on the mochi kinchiku.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When was it that Ayaka and I began to eat meals together like this without hesitation?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At least in high school, we would have lunch together, but we had to be reasonably prepared. Prepared to throw oneself into a space where the two of us were alone. Prepared to be ridiculed by those around us. Prepared to be envied. It took a lot of determination just to have a meal together, and it was far less frequent than it is now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I no longer need that kind of preparation because our relationship has metamorphosed ...... since high school, so that may be part of it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But more than that, everyone around me changed. After college, everyone became more tolerant, or worse, indifferent, to their surroundings.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">They are approaching adulthood.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From this casual piece of food, you can sense it, even if you don't like it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We're sophomores in college now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Considering the job search, the current peaceful student life will not last another year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">That, to me, is very scary.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I am a student, a free title. The fact that the time when I will lose it is just around the corner makes me feel helplessly uneasy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's wrong with your face?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka's voice widens my vision.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My small plate of chikuwa was added to my plate before I knew it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka put down her chopsticks and tilted her head.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Wasn't the oden good?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I recommended this restaurant, but Ayaka said such a thing. In other words, my expression must have been that different from usual.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, I don't know. We're going to be grown-ups, aren't we?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said, Ayaka laughed, "Huh?" I laughed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, we're over 20 now, aren't we?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When you cross the age of 20, you come of age. It is a matter of course.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But even recognizing that obviousness, I don't see myself as an adult now at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There's a difference between being an adult and being a grown-up."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka becomes a little mysterious when she hears my words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, maybe not. There are a lot of people who are still childish even after all these years."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I used to think that the moment you turn 20, you become an adult at heart. Not much has changed, has it?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">On my twentieth birthday, I was filled with more anticipation than usual about growing older. By that time, I had lost the idea of becoming an adult the moment I crossed the age of 20, but even so, my attitude was different from that of my usual birthday.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The first few days of my twentieth year were very productive.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The drinks at the izakaya tasted even better than usual, and small talk with friends increasingly included discussions of the economy and politics.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But that's it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The rest of the day is college, and the usual routine continues.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Not a child, not an adult.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">College students over the age of 20 are almost in a state of limbo, in limbo in either direction.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I want to go back to when I was in junior high and high school. I want to be young again, without thinking about anything, doing club activities and so on."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... Well, I'd go back if I could, me too."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka also has a melancholy look on her face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Despite my own feelings, the gears never stop.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wonder if the day will ever come when I can proudly say that I am an adult.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"...... or something?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He seemed concerned about my sudden weakness and looked into my face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Nothing else makes me feel guilty.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'No, sorry, nothing. Seriously, no, seriously."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't know. Well, that's kind of sentimental all of a sudden."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps it is the unique atmosphere of the end of the year that makes me think that way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But there was one more thing I had in mind.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I feel like I'm terribly old for him, even though we're only one year apart. It is not that he is childish for his age or that I am old.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I feel that my energy as a person is something decidedly different. When I look at Shinohara, I feel that I have somehow grown sloppy.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Such vague feelings may have accumulated at some point and suddenly made me feel depressed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But that's not something I'm going to talk about.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It doesn't matter what I say, it only annoys Ayaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Since Ayaka is buying me a drink, it would be a loss if I don't enjoy it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Deciding to think so, I rattled my chopsticks.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"All right, let's eat!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"There aren't any left."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka exhaled in disgust and gave me her own small plate. On it is the last of the daikon radish.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll give you half."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Seriously, thank you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After splitting the radish, I released it into my mouth, and it tasted as good as ever, although it was a little cold.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka watched me chewing with her cheeks for a while, and then said</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I look forward to working with you when I grow up."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Stay friends as ever. Is such an interpretation correct?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka smiled as she nodded without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I love that kind of expression on Ayaka's face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I never said it out loud, but that's what I thought.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was the morning after the day of Ayaka's shopping spree when I thought I heard the intercom ring.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I open the curtains, the sun is still glimmering in the east.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For me, who bases my life on self-indulgence during long vacations when I have no plans, the act of getting up in the morning is more painful than anything else.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought I was woken up by the sound of the intercom, but it was too much trouble to leave the bed all the way to check.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I pretended I didn't hear it and got under the covers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ping ping pong.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shut up!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I jump out of bed with a kabob.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If it was some kind of sales, I would not dare to make a complaint head-on, but I would at least check his face through the camera on the intercom.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But when I looked at the screen, I saw a figure I was already familiar with.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Press the call button and say a few words.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Go home."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He hangs up the call without waiting for Shinohara's reply.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He said he would come back, but he said it too soon to be definite. I imagined it would be a little longer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I checked the time, it was after 10 a.m.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Obviously it's not a time for worldly manners, but for me it's a time for bad manners.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The phone I was charging started shaking, and when I checked, it was Shinohara.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I can't help it. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With heavy steps, he proceeded to the front door and unlocked it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When the door opens, Shinohara is standing there with a backpack on his back.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Seniors, what do you have to say to me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"......Why did you come?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry to keep you waiting!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, ......."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It may or may not be convincing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After fooling around with a vague reply, Shinohara let out a sigh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll give you this. Here, senior, I'll give you this."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara then offers me a paper bag.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I received it, puzzled, I found it to be a famous high-end confectionery.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're good to go."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"We're in!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had no intention of stopping Shinohara from innocently entering the room. After confirming that Shinohara had entered the studio, I went into the changing room and took off my clothes to change out of my nightgown.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was in my underwear when I took the clothes I had been drying under the dryer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senpai, where are you ......?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The door opens and Shinohara enters.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When our eyes met, there was a moment of silence.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm sorry, I'm sorry. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Anyone would be surprised if the landlord suddenly found himself in his underwear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was relieved that I hadn't taken off my underwear.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, great."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I said shortly and put on my clothes, Shinohara shouted in surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's it? Aren't you more impatient than that! Did your junior see you in your underwear or something?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Mmm."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't know how I feel, but it doesn't diminish anything. If this had been the other way around, the response would have been different, so I'm glad I'm the one who gets to see it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The fact that he was awake and unable to think straight was also significant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm starving."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, ah, ...... I see. If you want something simple, I can make it for you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I respond gratefully to Shinohara, who makes a gratifying suggestion.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I just restocked the fridge yesterday, so I think it's pretty full today! I just restocked the fridge yesterday, so I think it's pretty full today!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;"><br /></span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I understand, I understand, but senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara slowly, slowly shifted his gaze to the side.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Put on your pants!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">......After all, getting out of bed is dangerous in many ways.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was wrongly impressed by the blushing Shinohara, who was surprisingly naive.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't you usually put it on from the bottom? I think it's from the bottom."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">While having a slightly late breakfast at a round table, Shinohara mentioned what had just happened.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't remember much, my head was a little fuzzy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's been less than an hour, so it's not like I'm forgetful, senpai."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara said in a tone of voice that said, "Are you serious?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The coat he was wearing is on a hanger and he is in a sweater.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Maybe that's just my nature."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After flushing it down the proper channels, he takes a sip of the consommé soup, which is now running low.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The exquisite spicy seasoning permeates the body, giving it a relaxing taste.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yum!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Delicious from the bottom of my heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps it is the perception that it is a girl's home-cooked meal that makes it taste many times better than consommé soup served at a restaurant, but there is no doubt that the simple fact that Shinohara is a good cook is also a factor.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do seniors usually eat?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Convenience store lunch boxes, beef bowls."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I knew it. It's bad for you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm aware of it. I can't help it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There is certainly plenty of time to prepare your own meals.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But having the time is one thing, having the energy is another.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The difference in energy between Shinohara and me that I felt yesterday may have been created by this way of thinking.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think I'll try ...... to cook for myself."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It may be while you are still a student that you can start something new without hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara said as he piled up the empty dishes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll tell you. I'll teach you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'd like to do it today. Let's get on with it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Gulp down the rest of the consommé soup.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Thanks for the food! It was delicious."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, it was worth making today. Senpai, they really look delicious."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Because it's delicious."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then he sits up and heads for the kitchen.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The shine of the freshly cleaned sink has not yet faded, and today, unusually, washing dishes does not feel like a chore.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shall I wash it for you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Why? I'm the only one who ate. Relax near where the cushions are, there are lots of comic books."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'I can only read a few pages if I'm only in between washing dishes.'"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although he said so, Shinohara headed toward the bookshelf.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">There were several works that I was interested in, and from time to time I heard people say, "Oh, I want to read this!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I was so familiar with the house I forgot I even cared about you. You're so familiar with the house, I forgot I even cared about you."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I finished washing the dishes for one person, I posed a question to Shinohara. Shinohara slammed the comic book that was about to open and laughed, "It's really a little late for that, isn't it?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I chuckle inside because it was my question that ended up cutting into my comic book reading time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wanted to show my face a little while I was going back to my parents' house. It's the last time I'll be able to see my seniors this year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, yeah."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Students who live alone usually return to their parents' homes at this time of year. I did not know where Shinohara's parents' home was, but I guess that means Shinohara will be leaving here for a while.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Aren't you going home, senpai? Tomorrow is New Year's Eve."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm fine with New Year's. I live close to my parents, so we see each other rather often. My parents live close by, so we see each other rather often."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was like, "Oh, I see. That's kind of unexpected.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara does not answer the question, but takes the cauldrons and bowls off the shelves and begins rummaging through the refrigerator.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wasn't interested in the answer either, so I watched the scene without paying attention.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I said, "Well, you have hollandaise sauce. You don't cook, so why do you have this?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I hear the word "hollandaise sauce," I have no idea what kind of sauce it is.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The container offered to me reminds me of the day I bought it on a whim.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I bought this a long time ago because I wanted to cook something elaborate. I haven't opened the seal yet."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Where did you get this?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Net."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I knew it. It's a waste, so let's use this today. Senpai, may I ask you to break four eggs?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Okay."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Take four eggs out of the refrigerator.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He tried to crack an egg open with one hand, but he sank without a trace.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Why are you trying to break it with one hand, please be normal?'"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I think I just made one mistake. That's when I started my rapid ascent."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Excuse me."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara takes the egg from my hand and cracks it in tempo. With both hands.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I put the butter in the microwave, threw the hollandaise sauce I had just made into a large pot, and in a few minutes the kitchen was filled with a scene beyond my comprehension.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I follow Shinohara's instructions and feel somewhat like an assistant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You sound like some kind of chef."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, who prepares food quickly and efficiently, looks somehow more mature than usual. People who excel in areas they are not good at are somehow attractive.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I like to cook, don't you? Oh, pass the bacon right there..."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara, who had been instructing me on this and that, suddenly stopped moving.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What's wrong?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, senpai. You have no idea what I'm making, do you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eggrolls, right?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"How can someone who takes this long to fry an egg teach cooking? ...... I mean, it's way too much work for an omelet."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then Shinohara groaned, "Hmmm.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was enjoying myself so much that I forgot to teach my senpai how to cook. I'll teach you how to cook next time, so you can relax.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yeah, why?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I wanted to show you the finished product after I put it on a plate."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara said, and began humming a tune.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">You really like to cook.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcbmEY0rp_-ShdUYUMYACjrvpxAHGfjVHyaZHtI_Sc897KwiVcNreR0kA89M_JkfWBJRepR3XuUVWi6hTxHXUEscB6XXGgjd4BXgnH6C2n0MDeqlPNi1buUmdFoeNtJVS04ypghcukYly1ikhBvR4XjOZgiHt2RW30iZ5C0q6JXnVPmjp-oK0aUO3m/s800/00016.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEhcbmEY0rp_-ShdUYUMYACjrvpxAHGfjVHyaZHtI_Sc897KwiVcNreR0kA89M_JkfWBJRepR3XuUVWi6hTxHXUEscB6XXGgjd4BXgnH6C2n0MDeqlPNi1buUmdFoeNtJVS04ypghcukYly1ikhBvR4XjOZgiHt2RW30iZ5C0q6JXnVPmjp-oK0aUO3m/s16000/00016.jpeg" /></span></a></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I decided to enjoy the finished dish too and rolled over in bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Rather than feeling sorry for making Shinohara do the cooking alone, I was more looking forward to it. I also felt that my help would spoil the flavor of the food, and it would be a shame to waste all that effort.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After flipping through the manga for a while, a slightly smug-looking Shinohara brought a platter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ta-da!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I opened my mouth at the sight of this social media-worthy food.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I never thought my house could produce something this delicious. I never thought my house could produce something this delicious."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Eggs Benedict. It's stylish and delicious, and one of my favorite recipes."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What does it mean that even the name is fashionable, as well as the appearance?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Would you like one? I just had breakfast."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thanks to the fact that my breakfast had been less than eight portions, I still had an appetite. I picked it up and bit into it, and the tender yolk tangled on my tongue.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Uma! What the hell, umma!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's really good! It's delicious!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Even Shinohara praised himself for his eggs benedict, which he said was well done.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara must cook quite a bit on a regular basis, as he was able to instantly come up with a recipe from an unfamiliar condiment called hollandaise sauce.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I have time for the bullet train, so I'd better get going."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, you're really just here to show your face."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was a little surprised because I thought what he had just said was some kind of dialect. Shinohara nodded as if it were a matter of course.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes, as I said before. I've been indebted to my seniors for the short time I've been with them."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're not close to home. I'm glad you went to the trouble."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">No matter how much we have taken care of him, it is somewhat apologetic that he took time out of his busy year-end schedule to come to us.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But Shinohara denied it with a big sigh.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You know, senpai. Do I look so good-natured that I would go to your house just for that reason?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Muu~......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Quite simply, I can't see it at all.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The Motosaka case gave us a glimpse of his attitude toward people who had lost interest in him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I quit club activities and broke up with my senior Yudo, so I have a lot of free time right now. I'm not busy at the moment. I had no choice but to come over to him."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're just trying to kill time, aren't you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I feel like I have a bad personality if you put it that way."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is as good as saying so, but how can he smile so wonderfully?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara's unconventional free-spiritedness is refreshing to watch.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, if you have a face as pretty as Shinohara's, there must be plenty of men who would be happy just to be bothered by you to pass the time.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I feel lonely eating alone, so let's have dinner together once in a while. I'll do the housework."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara leans forward and gives me a superior look.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Just for today, nothing else."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll be here five times a week!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Are you even listening to me?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara puts his hand over his mouth and shakes his shoulders in a funny way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It sounds like a fun thing to do.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Then maybe twice a week. I'll let you know in advance when I'm going to be there, so that's fine."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What do you mean "okay"? It's as if you're sure I'm going to agree to it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But compared to the first request, twice a week with advance notice seems better.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I'm not particularly busy myself, and if you do the housework, there seemed to be no particular reason to refuse, although I'm a little impatient to have less time for private life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And the time I spend with Shinohara is somewhat fulfilling.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was the one who came to that conclusion so easily.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Well, okay."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I responded, "I'm sorry.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Hmmm. Door-in-the-face, great success!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What the hell is that?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He frowned at the sudden appearance of a side letter.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's a negotiation technique that says, "If you make a big demand at the beginning, it will be easier to get what you want later. It's been featured on TV and elsewhere."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I thought, "Wow, I've heard that one before. I guess it's a little more catchy than you think when it's used in everyday life."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, it is highly doubtful that the current conversation with Shinohara can be called an everyday conversation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm glad I listened to the lecture. I'm glad I listened to your lecture."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara sat up, satisfied with my response.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I sit up to see him off to the front door, Shinohara stops me with his hand.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, it's all right to see me off. We're the ones who rushed in."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"'Okay. Well, here we are. See you next year."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Yes! Have a good New Year!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After making a saluting gesture, Shinohara grinned.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh. Thanks for this year."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In response to my reply, Shinohara bows with a bow and heads for the front door.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The door opens, the sound of the wind blowing can be heard, and soon it is silent again.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Shinohara's house and my house must have different nearest stations. That guy said he was going home on the Shinkansen, which means he went out of his way to come from the station to show his face.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I've had a less than flattering year myself, as my girlfriend of about a year cheated on me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Still, I felt we had a not bad ending.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was stuck on the bed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Today is the day of the party my friend invited me to. I was invited to the party to make up the number of people, and I agreed to go with a light heart, but when the day came, I didn't want to go.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was having a hard time moving on and was seriously wondering if I should cancel.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But considering my friend's position, it would be quite embarrassing to have the number of people not match on the day of the event. I don't care what some guy I don't know thinks of me, but I don't want to embarrass my friend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Hmmm, let's go to ....... ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I reluctantly move my heavy, unbearable body and go to the mirror.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A few days have passed since the beginning of the year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It's a normal morning, but the word "New Year" is still fresh in my mind and everyone seems somewhat buoyant.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The TV program also still had a spirited lineup.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I looked at my phone and saw that it was just about to display some messages. I had my phone on silent mode, so it didn't make a sound, but this happens sometimes.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">['Akemae! I'm really looking forward to the upcoming movie, how about you, Mayu-chan?"]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In light of the sender, the message is not worth returning now.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I reply to these troublesome communications in bulk when I feel like it. For my mental health, it suits me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After washing my face, I felt somewhat better about my laziness.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Take out the makeup base from the drawer of the vanity.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As I dab the primer, which is about the size of a ten-yen coin, onto my skin, the feeling of not wanting to go outside fades away.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If I can get through today, I can relax since I don't have any plans for the rest of the day. Thinking positively, I dab on more foundation on top of the primer I've spread on.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When did I start thinking of makeup as a form of grooming?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">At least when I was in high school, I think it was fine to wear makeup or not. People who wore makeup were a bit more mature, and those who didn't were separately normal. How much easier it would have been if that kind of perception had persisted.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I entered college, everyone around me was wearing makeup, so I followed suit and started doing it every day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My mood when putting on makeup varies from day to day, but today I am especially naïve.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"It's a pain in the ass."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Speak out and vent your feelings.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Still, I don't let up on my makeup. I am pretty without makeup, but I am sure that makeup will make me even prettier.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her pride as a woman does not allow her to expose her sloppy makeup in front of men.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Finally, I applied a light pink lipstick to my lips and set about getting dressed.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My mood is not at all buoyant, but I decide what to wear after a fair amount of hesitation.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I feel like I'm deciding what to wear to battle rather than what to wear on a date.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I was going to be late, so I hurried out of the house and walked quickly to the station. On the way, I realized that today's shoes are just sneakers.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I almost wished I had worn heels if I had gone to the trouble of getting dressed up, but I shook my head mentally.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you didn't care that much, then today's blind date was not worth it. If it were a date with someone I liked, I would have spent a lot of time worrying about the slight difference in heel height.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, the guy you like."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The last time in my life when I could clearly say, "I love this person! I can't remember the exact time in my life when I clearly felt "I love this person! I can't remember exactly.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But lately, there is someone nearby who makes me feel differently about the other opposite sex.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Senior, are you free today?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If the party is boring, leave in the middle of the party.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I open the app and send a message to my senior.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">[I want to come in today. I'd like to come in today. Could you leave the key in the mailbox?]</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">What a brazen statement. It's to the level that I would pull back if someone else showed it to me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Then, in an instant, I receive a reply, 'New Year's Day. I receive a reply saying, 'Roger.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">A curt reply with no emoji.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And yet, why is it that a certain warmth can be felt?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I agonized over it for a few seconds before sending my senior a cute stamp I had recently purchased.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My heavy steps felt a little lighter.</span></p><p>
