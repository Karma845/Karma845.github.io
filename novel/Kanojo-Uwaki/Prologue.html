<h3>Prologue</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">I will never forget that day.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had a girlfriend that I had been dating for almost a year.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Her name is Rena Aisaka.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We went to different universities, but we are the same age and talk well together. And she is too cute looking for me.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">He had a mild-mannered personality and was often envied by those around him.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">College student relationships are a step more mature than those of middle and high school students.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Naturally, we had an adult relationship.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In a way, it may be natural for people to be envious.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I myself was so proud to be dating such a well-made girlfriend that I was so enthusiastic that I even planned an ill-fitting surprise.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I wonder if this is what a one-year anniversary is supposed to feel like."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">In his hand is the expensive champagne he purchased for their one-year anniversary date.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It was unthinkable for me before that we would plan to drink champagne together, which was built on the anniversary of when we started dating, and which I would say is for couples to do.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I've also made reservations for an Italian course tomorrow, which she loves, and I'm sure she'll love it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">As we get closer to the house, I have a sense of anticipation for how Rena will react, and a slight sense of anxiety that it would be unbearable if all the preparation I have done so far does not pay off.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">But all that awaited him in front of his house was the unexplainable situation of his girlfriend consorting with another man.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Let's split up."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I had no idea that our one-year relationship would end this way.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This was a month before I met Santa Claus.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">With the arrival of the beautiful Santa Claus, my daily life changes drastically.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">&#9671;&#9670;</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Santa doesn't come when you're a good boy. ......"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The smoke from the cigarettes I started smoking this year flickers in the cold air.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I, Yuta Hasegawa, let out my frustration in a park near the station.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I wouldn't be a bad boy or girl if Santa paid me for it."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">My friend Ayaka Mino, who is waiting for me to finish my cigarette next to her, smiles and says something back to me. I could roughly guess what she was trying to say by her expression.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"And what is the reward?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Boyfriend!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I know you will."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka's mouth dropped as she curtly responded to the expected answer.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"What? Of course not. It's usually like that this time of year."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">She asks, "What do you want?" as she watches me suck down my third cigarette. Ayaka seemed to know my answer and her mouth was already tearing up.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Gold."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Pfft, I knew it!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka blurts out the answer she has been waiting for.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Shut up."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Now it was my turn to shrug my mouth. Ayaka laughed more and more funny when she saw that.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're still hung up on your ex-girlfriend, aren't you?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"That's crazy."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Haha, no. I can't stop laughing."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"No, it's not!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">When I got pissed off and raised my voice, Ayaka finally stopped laughing.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, Sorry , I'm sorry."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Bad character."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Don't sulk."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I let out an involuntary sigh as Ayaka clapped me on the shoulder, still holding back a laugh and twitching her mouth.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka and I have known each other for quite a long time, from our sophomore year of high school to our current sophomore year of college. Since they are in the same department, they spend a lot of time together.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka, who has what the world calls a beautiful face, is very popular.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">However, as they got to know each other better, they thought he had a difficult personality, and for whatever reason, he was unable to find a boyfriend.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I don't dislike his personality of laughing at people's misfortune. In fact, when he laughed at me when I broke up with my ex-girlfriend, it lightened my heart.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I broke up with my ex-girlfriend a month ago as a result of her cheating on me, and most of my friends get upset when they hear about it and try to comfort me somehow.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I hated to see her like that, and I was grateful to Ayaka for laughing about it.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And although some people say she has a difficult personality, Ayaka is quite a kind person. In fact, she is even willing to have a cigarette with me right now, even though she is not a smoker.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"So, how are things going with your ex-girlfriend? Do you keep in touch with her?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I don't think so. I'm not that mentally strong."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'm going to go. Are you coming soon? A party."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Ayaka smiles with a twinkle in her eye. Ayaka, who is involved with many people in various circles and has a broad face, sometimes acts as the organizer of a party and invites me to attend.</span></p><div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzUQ6nPcmlZhWoP-1KwJpj-rbG2LYDZnHxydoPNaaQn9ifAv0FbzJVnQc34LhkLoM2lq4JJzS0BYDmWx2Fsr6RmwYb5e8zBppjjTni3f22XO9GNZbR5axPHoncErgf15xqXNyjrczOM95Uu7QuydJJnkFMSzq2XvUIAGIEyu1oWQ1iNmI7bp1JQ3EM/s800/00009.jpeg" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><span style="font-size: medium;"><img border="0" data-original-height="800" data-original-width="564" src="https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/b/R29vZ2xl/AVvXsEgzUQ6nPcmlZhWoP-1KwJpj-rbG2LYDZnHxydoPNaaQn9ifAv0FbzJVnQc34LhkLoM2lq4JJzS0BYDmWx2Fsr6RmwYb5e8zBppjjTni3f22XO9GNZbR5axPHoncErgf15xqXNyjrczOM95Uu7QuydJJnkFMSzq2XvUIAGIEyu1oWQ1iNmI7bp1JQ3EM/s16000/00009.jpeg" /></span></a></div><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Ew."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll be your Santa!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, you're getting paid? I'm going."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"You're so sad! What's so sad that I have to pay you!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I'll see you later."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Push the cigarette into the ashtray and leave the smoking area.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh, are you going?"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Sorry, I have to work today."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"I see. See you soon. Give me a line when you're ready."</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">"Oh!"</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">After a short greeting, we headed home.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I didn't like the party very much.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The part-time job was a lie that I had quickly come up with, but I had no choice since I was likely to receive endless invitations if I stayed with Ayaka as it was.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The lingering aroma of cigarettes soaked into my clothes was very much in my nose today.</span></p>
