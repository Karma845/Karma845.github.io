<h3>Afterword</h3>

<p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you are from the book version, it is nice to meet you. My name is Yuu Omiya.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">If you have been reading the web version, it has been a while. This is Mr. Mee.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Thank you very much for picking up this work.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">This work is a book version of a web version that was posted on the novel submission sites "Kakuyomu" and "Syosetu" with additions and corrections.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">......Suddenly, what does Christmas look like to you?</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">These days, most people might answer that it is a day to spend with your loved one. Other answers that are expected to be more common are that it is a day to celebrate the birth of Christ .......</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">For me, Christmas is Santa. I go to sleep on Christmas Eve, excited about Santa's visit, and in the morning I find a present on my pillow at ....... Although I no longer receive presents, I still remember that exciting feeling. I have to be filial to Santa Claus who left me wonderful memories when I go back to my hometown.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Although each person has a different image of Christmas, I think what they all have in common is a sense of the extraordinary.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Just having a few days during the year when we can experience this kind of extraordinary feeling makes the calendar more colorful, doesn't it? I have been thinking recently that the reason couples celebrate anniversaries is to add color to their daily lives.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Perhaps everyone is trying to bring a sense of the unusual into their daily lives in some way, though in different ways. Perhaps the result is the current Christmas season.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I started writing this work with the hope that it would be a small, extraordinary feeling that could accompany everyday life, just like Christmas.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I never thought that I would be able to publish it as a paperback book. I was very surprised myself.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It all started with a web novel contest held at Kakuyomu.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">We were awarded a special prize and were able to make our debut with Kadokawa Sneaker Bunko.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">From here, I would like to acknowledge those who were involved in the debut.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">The person in charge who kindly consulted with me when I was making additions and corrections. The proofreader who gave me many suggestions. Sales staff and editorial staff. Thank you very much.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">And then there is Mr. Eru, who drew the illustration. When the illustration was sent to me for the first time, I was so moved that I let out a funny sound. Thank you very much for bringing the characters to life.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Finally, to all readers who have picked up this book and read through the afterword.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">It is literally with the support of our readers that I am able to write this piece. Thank you so much.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Those who want to meet the little devil juniors again. Those who want to meet the bad friend beauty. Those who are curious about the rest of the story.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I hope you'll recommend this film to as many people as you can!</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">Well, then, it's time to go.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">I wish to see you all again in the second volume and close the postscript.</span></p><p><span style="font-size: medium;">......I hope I wrote a good first postcard.</span></p><p><b><span style="font-size: medium;">Yuu Omiya</span></b></p>
