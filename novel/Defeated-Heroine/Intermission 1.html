<h3>Intermission &#8211; It&#8217;s Different When It Happens Before My Eyes</h3>

<p>Class 2-3, Momozono Middle School.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">After the opening ceremony, the classmates are chatting non-stop after their short farewell.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">There&#8217;s one girl whose an exception. Her elbows are planted on her desk as she gazes forlornly out the window.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;Onii-sama&#8230;has gone somewhere really far&#8230;&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">This mumbling girl is Kaju Nukumizu.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">A tall classmate walked over. She lowered her head and watched her.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong, Nuku-chan?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;Gon-chan&#8230;&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">Kaju slowly turned her face.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">The girl talking to her is Asami Gonto. She&#8217;s Kaju&#8217;s closest friend in class. She&#8217;s relatively tall for a middle school student, which adds to her maturity.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;What&#8217;s wrong? Tell me all about it.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">A tinge of worry appeared in her eyes.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;Kaju has told you onii-sama has made a friend before, right&#8230;?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;Yeah, wasn&#8217;t Nuku-chan really happy?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;I am, but that friend is a gorgeous girl.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">Her body suddenly slumped onto her desk as if she had run out of energy.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;Also, the worst part is that Kaju thought onii-sama just made one friend. It turns out there&#8217;s a second one. &#8230;Kaju barged into onii-sama&#8217;s room a while ago, and the mood was a bit tight.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;I see. Huh, I guess your brother shouldn&#8217;t be underestimated. Is he very handsome?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">Kaju immediately straightened up.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;Of course! Onii-sama is no.1 in the world-&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">Kaju&#8217;s eyes are sparkling like gemstones. However, a tinge of apprehension suddenly appeared in them.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;&#8230;Don&#8217;t you try anything funny, okay? Kaju doesn&#8217;t want to call Gon-chan onee-san.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;Onee-san?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">Gon-chan gave it some thought.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;Nuku-chan becoming my little sister, that sounds nice.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;Gon-chan!?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;It&#8217;s a joke, but shouldn&#8217;t Nuku-chan be proud that your brother is popular?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;B-But, this is&#8230;two girls at once, alright? Kaju hasn&#8217;t even interviewed them.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;Didn&#8217;t you say you would be thrilled if your brother got a brilliant girlfriend?&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;It&#8217;s different when it&#8217;s happening before my eyes. &#8230;I was going to get to know the girl onii-sama likes and watch them from afar. But, onii-sama brought two girls into his room right away and complicated the mood. &#8230;Onii-sama is in his popular phase&#8230;&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">Kaju slumped back onto her desk face-first again. She&#8217;s kicking her legs under the desk.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">Gon-chan gently stroked Kaju&#8217;s head.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;Alright, be good. I&#8217;ll take Nuku-chan if that happens.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;But Kaju wants onii-sama&#8230;&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;I see. I was rejected.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">Kaju raised her head off the desk.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;&#8230;But Gon-chan is Kaju&#8217;s best friend.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;You&#8217;re adorable, Nuku-chan. Yeah, you should be my wife.&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">&#8220;I can&#8217;t&#8230;&#8221;</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">Kaju collapsed onto her desk once more as Gon-chan gave her head pats.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">Kaju Nukumizu, 14 years old.</span></span></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">Even though she&#8217;s pleased to know that her dear onii-sama has friends now, she can&#8217;t work out her own feelings right away.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 8pt; margin-top: 0pt;"></p><p><span style="color: #666666; font-family: inherit;">Gon-chan continued stroking her head as Kaju thought about that.</span></span></p><p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 1.2; margin-bottom: 8pt; margin-top: 0pt;"></p>
