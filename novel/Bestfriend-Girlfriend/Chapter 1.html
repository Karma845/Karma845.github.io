<h1>Chapter 1: Gal and Meetup</h3>


<p>I tried meeting up with a fellow light novel enthusiast whom I had become friends with on social media, but it turned out that she was a beautiful gal from my class!</p>

<p>I never thought that I would encounter something like a long-winded light novel title…</p>
<p>With such a thought, I checked her appearance again.</p>
<p>She was a gal, a gal to the fullest, but not a light-skinned gal.</p>
<p>She’s so white that she’s almost transparent; she’s a gal with a clean and neat look.</p>
<p>Isn’t this gal contradictory?</p>

<p>“Alright, Let’s go! I’m looking forward to the autograph event!”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah…”</p>

<p>With that feeble reply, I start walking behind Tsumakawa-san, who’s striding confidently ahead. Her excitement is palpable.</p>

<p>I really don’t get it!</p>
<p>How did a socially awkward otaku like me end up walking through Tokyo with a gal?</p>
<p>By the way, we’re currently heading towards a large bookstore near Shibuya Station, where the purpose of today’s meetup is to attend the book signing event for the author of 『Thanks to Reincarnation, I Could Get Engaged to a Goddess (Tensei shita okage de megami to kon’yaku dekimashita)』 ——or 『Tenkon』 for short.</p>

<p>Just the other day, Minacho-san proposed, ‘It’s a waste to just meet up, let’s go to the signing event together!’</p>
<p>So that’s why the two of us are on our way to the event venue in the bookstore…</p>
<p>Is this person Minacho-san? Are you really Minacho-san?</p>

<p>“You look kind of quiet, huh? Are you nervous?”</p>
<p>“N-No, I am not feeling any sense of nervousness…”</p>
<p>“Why are you using polite language? You seem about the same age, so casual language is fine.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>It seems she hasn’t realized that I am, Nezumayo, is her classmate.</p>
<p>Well, that’s understandable. I have about as much presence in that class as a roadside pebble. If anything, a pretty pebble might have more presence than me.</p>
<p>While thinking this, she continues talking with a somewhat cheerful tone.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I’m really glad we can meet like this in real life, Nezumayo! You’ve always been there for me when I want to talk… Fufu, you’re exactly the kind of otaku guy I imagined.”</p>
<p>“…are you making fun of me right now? “</p>
<p>“No, not at all. In fact, I was kind of expecting some seriously dangerous otaku to show up, so I’m disappointed to see this basic and not-so-creepy guy!”</p>
<p>“Stop making remarks that are unclear whether you’re building me up or putting me down.”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry, but I’m seriously happy! ——I really like you, Nezumayo! Meeting like this in real life got me super excited! Let’s have a great time today!”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>

<p>As she says this with an innocent smile, I can’t help but be a bit embarrassed.</p>

<p>What’s with this girl? How can she throw so much genuine affection at someone who’s just an acquaintance from Twitter? She’s way too friendly…</p>
<p>As I’m thinking this, I finally ask her the question that’s been on my mind since earlier.</p>

<p>“…By the way, are you really ‘Minacho’?”</p>
<p>“You don’t believe me? “</p>
<p>“Well… I mean, I didn’t expect a sunny, outgoing gal like you to hang out on Twitter as a light novel reader and interact with an otaku like me…”</p>
<p>“Wait, Nezumayo-kun, you’re being biased and assuming gals don’t read light novels, aren’t you? In this day and age, it’s better to drop those narrow perspectives, okay?”</p>
<p>“Huh… With the way you’re talking, are you saying gals do read light novels?”</p>
<p>“Nope, generally they don’t!”</p>
<p>“They don’t? Then why did you mislead me like that, you gal?”</p>

<p>As I retort, Minacho-san, or rather, Tsumakawa-san, chuckles in amusement.</p>
<p>Then, she squints her eyes a little and starts talking eloquently.</p>

<p>“Honestly, I’m not your typical gal, you see? Ordinary gals probably don’t get saved by light novels during tough times like, ‘Life is so hard.’ But, I’m different.”</p>
<p>“…Minacho-san, have you been saved by light novels?”</p>
<p>“Hm, just once? When I was in the first year of middle school and had just started modeling, things weren’t going well at all… Maybe it was because I was a bit of an idiot about modeling at the time. Anyway, during that time, I happened to watch a late-night anime that was seriously interesting, and I got into the light novel based on that anime. That’s when I got hooked on the world of light novels.”</p>
<p>“I see… So that’s how it happened…”</p>
<p>“To be honest, there are so many enjoyable activities in the world, right? From karaoke and bowling to BBQ and shopping——even movies, manga and anime, they’re all so much fun. That’s why light novels, which require consuming and interacting with text, seem like a bothersome form of entertainment that demands too much effort and energy. But I don’t know why? This is what I love the most for some reason.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Why do I love it so much? If you were to ask me that, I wouldn’t have a straightforward answer… Maybe because it feels like the freest form of entertainment in the world. Maybe not really, but from my point of view as a reader, I feel that light novels are incredibly free. As long as the author has enough imagination, we can go anywhere, and reading them really excites me! There’s a mixture of good and bad because there’s such a huge variety – but when I dig and dig and dig into all sorts of works and finally discover a masterpiece light novel that’s just for me, I’m as happy as when I find a real diamond!  Or more like… uh, sorry, I got carried away.”</p>

<p>Just as I thought she was enjoying her conversation, Tsumakawa-san abruptly cut off the conversation.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I, who was amazed by her unexpected comment, said to myself in a whisper.</p>

<p>“Minacho-san always tweets long sentences, and the gal in front of me right now was saying something similar… Could it be that this girl is actually Minacho-san…?”</p>
<p>“Yay, you admit it! Gal Peace!”</p>
<p>“What’s with that ‘Gal Peace’? If it’s a peace sign with the fingers pointing downwards. That’s a ‘Down Peace’.” (TN: A pose like in the illustration (5th image).)</p>
<p>“You’re nitpicking Gal Peace, huh? Anyway, now you know, right? I’m the real Minacho, and I’m the one you’ve been having fun chats with, Nezumayo-kun!”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah… I guess so. You really are Minacho-san…”</p>

<p>With her values now communicated in a manner befitting Minacho-san, I finally grasped the fact that Minacho-san = the class sunny gal.</p>

<p>However, my feelings are quite complex…I don’t mean to be rude to her, but it’s still pretty shocking…</p>
<p>After all, today I was expecting to hang out with a male friend who loves light novels. And now, I’m attending a signing event with this dazzling white gal…</p>

<p>Gals are the last people we otaku types can understand and feel at ease around, right? As I ponder this, we reach the bookstore.</p>
<p>Inside, we head toward the floor where the light novels are placed to purchase the book to be signed by the author.</p>


<p>While riding the escalator together, Tsumakawa suddenly shoots me a question.</p>

<p>“Minacho being a gal, were you disappointed?”</p>
<p>” …. “</p>

<p>I was taken aback as she threw a question that was quite close to what I was pondering.</p>
<p>As I remain silent, Tsumakawa-san, for some reason, continues to speak with a cheerful smile on her face.</p>

<p>“Sorry I didn’t say I’m a ‘gal’ up until today. Among the friends I usually hang out with, there’s no one who likes light novels, so I used an anonymous account to interact with you, Nezumayo. But I think I also had a hidden thought somewhere in my heart that it would be a bit weird to call myself a gal who likes light novels. I didn’t mean to keep it a secret, but it was a little unfair because I never told you about it… surprised, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, I was really surprised. First of all, I didn’t even think you were a girl…”</p>
<p>“But even if that’s revealed before, it’s okay. I just wanted to meet Nezumayo today.”</p>

<p>Saying that, Tsumakawa-san turns to me and smiles.</p>
<p>In response, I don’t know what expression I should make and end up with a wry smile, somewhere between a smile and awkwardness. Then, she extends her hand toward me and says,</p>

<p>“Nice to meet you, Nezumayo-kun. I’m Minacho, a high school girl from Saitama, and I’m a full-on gal—please take care of me in the future!”</p>
<p>“…N-nice to meet you too…”</p>

<p>Unable to grasp the offered right hand, I only manage to say something like that.</p>
<p>Then, she takes my right hand herself and says, ‘Here, shake hands!’——At that moment, I feel my hand enveloped by a soft, girlish touch.</p>
<p>What’s with this softness…?! Is it possible that girls are made entirely of baked pudding or something? </p>

<p>As we step off the escalator, Tsumakawa and I each pick up a copy of the first volume of ‘Tenkon,’ which is stacked on display in the light novel corner. And naturally, we both start looking through the light novels on this floor.</p>
<p>Just as I was marveling at the extensive selection of books in the store, Tsumakawa next to me picks up a light novel from the shelf. Then, she shows me the cover and says,</p>

<p>“Look, look! The art is by Iida Paberu-sensei——it’s so hot!”</p>
<p>“I can only agree. Even though it’s explicit, it’s not vulgar, which is impressive.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! This cover is so eye-catching and messy!”</p>
<p>“What do you mean by eye-catching and messy… Well, it’s certainly eye-catching, but it’s not really that messy… If anything, it’s moe and a well-organized mess.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it more weird to say it’s ‘moe and a well-organized mess’ ?”</p>

<p>After I respond with that, Tsumakawa retorts and chuckles again.</p>
<p>Even though we’re just having an insubstantial conversation…this gal, I can’t help but think that she’s having a bit too much fun.</p>
<p>However, even though it’s a bit hard to believe, I can somewhat sense that she’s the genuine Minacho through these light exchanges.</p>
<p>..I see. This girl, who’s always had those silly exchanges with me on Twitter, is the real Minacho…</p>

<p>『Can someone give me a recommendation for a good light novel?』</p>
<p>『That’s right +1! Tell this Minacho what novels you recommend!』</p>
<p>『Please don’t reply to other people’s tweets asking for recommendations. How self-centered!』</p>
<p>『You have a point! Then, let’s exchange recommended light novels! I’ll give you Minacho’s recommendation, so you should recommend one too!』</p>
<p>『In that case, I recommend ‘Tenkon’!』</p>
<p>『Thanks~! Well then, goodbye!』</p>
<p>『That’s not what you promised!』</p>

<p>I often exchanged this kind of conversation with Minacho-san on SNS.</p>
<p>…I never imagined that the person I was having this conversation with was the gal from the same class, though.</p>

<p>“Hm? What’s up? Have you fallen for Minacho?”</p>
<p>“N-No, it’s not like that…”</p>

<p>While I was lost in thought while looking at Tsumakawa-san, she said something unexpected.</p>
<p>She probably asked jokingly, but I could never imagine falling in love with a three-dimensional girl.</p>
<p>Yet, she continues with a deliberately cheerful smile,</p>

<p>“Eh—. If Nezumayo-kun were to fall for me, I’d be quite happy.”</p>
<p>“N-No, that’s not it. I haven’t fallen for you…!”</p>
<p>“There’s no need to be so embarrassed. Be honest, you——”</p>
<p>“Hey… Could you not just pinch my cheek without my permission? You gal have a way too close sense of personal space!”</p>
<p>“Heheh, that’s what being a gal is like.”</p>
<p>“What kind of emotion are you showing off with that smug face?”</p>

<p>I retort to Tsumakawa, who’s massaging my cheek with her right hand.</p>
<p>This girl, taking advantage of her status as a gal, is way too casual with her physical touches…!</p>
<p>I don’t really mind her being easygoing, but before engaging in physical contact, could she at least consider whether the other person is comfortable with it or not!?</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>And so, Minacho (Tsumakawa-san) and I toured the store until around 2 o’clock, and the starting time for the autograph session arrived.</p>
<p>We participated, got the author of ‘Tenkon’ to sign our copies, and now, with content smiles after accomplishing our goal, we’re taking a break in a nearby cafe.</p>

<p>“Yatta! I got Nasutake-sensei’s autograph! My excitement goes through the roof!”</p>
<p>“Right? When I actually saw the author in person, I couldn’t contain my excitement either… My excitement goes through the roof!”</p>
<p>“Hey, could you not casually use the gal language I use? Do you look down on gals?”</p>

<p>Being told that by Tsumakawa sitting across from me, I apologize and say I’m sorry.</p>
<p>By the way, this cafe is the type where you order your drinks in advance.</p>
<p>I got an iced coffee, while Tsumakawa loaded her vanilla frappuccino with various toppings, transforming what was originally white into a brown liquid.</p>
<p>I’m not sure if it can still be called a vanilla frappuccino after all that…</p>

<p>“Hey一, today was super fun! Thanks, Nezumayo!”</p>
<p>“…Hm? Why are you thanking me?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Well, because I said ‘I wanted to meet you’, we met, and it was really fun, so isn’t it appropriate to say ‘thank you’? Is there any other word to say besides ‘thank you’?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>Saying this without any hesitation, Tsumakawa smiles at me…and seeing that, I unintentionally look away.</p>
<p>In response to my reaction, Tsumakawa-san’s expression takes on a mischievous look, and she continues.</p>

<p>“You know, I thought that maybe Nezumayo-kun would get nervous around me, a gal, and stop talking to me—but hehe, it was a lot of fun! You did a good job!”</p>
<p>“…Minacho-san, aren’t you underestimating me?”</p>
<p>“Wait, I’m not underestimating you! ——Also, it’s not like I think that if I’m a little nicer to you, you might start falling head over heels for me and become a convenient guy for me or anything! I’m definitely not thinking like that!”</p>
<p>“I’ve been underestimated more than I thought…don’t underestimate me while acting like tsundere!”</p>
<p>“By the way, changing the topic, isn’t tsundere great? I really like tsundere girls! Nezumayo, do you like tsundere?”</p>
<p>“Probably among guys who read light novels, there’s no one who doesn’t like tsundere.”</p>
<p>“Ahaha, right? ——Hmm, I’m not saying that I’m happy to find someone who also likes tsundere like me or anything, but it was nice to hear that!”</p>
<p>“Don’t go full tsundere even when expressing the joy of finding someone who likes tsundere. Your tsundere is starting to have a gestalt collapse.”</p>

<p>When I retort like that, Tsumakawa still seems to enjoy herself and says, ‘There’s no way Gestalt Collapse happening!”</p>
<p>…It seems like this gal is having too much fun talking in a tsundere-like manner.</p>

<p>As I was about to laugh at that thought, Tsumakawa took a sip of her vanilla frappuccino, then with a calm expression, she smiled and says,</p>

<p>“But you see, I like tsundere girls, but I can’t be a tsundere myself… Look, I tend to blurt out what I’m thinking right away. Are you surprised?”</p>
<p>“Personally, I’m not surprised at all.”</p>
<p>“Heheh——Well, I think not saying what you’re thinking might be a disadvantage. Don’t you think it’s better to say your feelings first, like ‘I like you!’ to the person you like, so they won’t have a hard time liking you back? You see, I’m the type who tends to say my feelings first.<br />
Do you understand?</p>
<p>“I don’t understand, but at the same time, I do understand.”</p>
<p>“Which one is it?”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa teases me with that retort, but that’s actually quite close to my real feelings.</p>
<p>While I personally can’t relate to that, I can understand why some people are like that.</p>
<p>With these thoughts in my mind, I gaze at Tsumakawa.</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t have to understand what I mean.”</p>

<p>…Not that it matters, but I think she’s been smiling happily all day today.</p>

<p>“By the way, I’m going to change the subject——Actually, it’s not going to change.”</p>
<p>“Your way of saying that is pretty odd.”</p>
<p>“Nezumayo-kun, do you have a girlfriend right now?”</p>
<p>“…I’ve never had a girlfriend in my life, let alone now.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, is that so?”</p>

<p>Even though she’s the one that asked me, Tsumakawa responds with a lack of interest.</p>
<p>Then, she delivers an unexpected line while twirling the tips of her tea-colored hair between her fingers without blushing as if it was something insignificant.</p>

<p>“Then, how about dating me?”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>

<p>I was puzzled for a moment.</p>
<p>She spoke those words like asking a friend next to her, ‘What class do we have next?’</p>
<p>There’s no passionate emotion behind it; it was an incredibly dry confession, and since it was a confession I wasn’t accustomed to hearing, my brain couldn’t catch up with her words…</p>
<p>Date? Tsumakawa and me?</p>

<p>Before I could even process the cute gal’s confession, I struggled to understand it in the first place.</p>
<p>So, I ended up closely staring at Tsumakawa’s face.</p>
<p>In response, she smiles teasingly at me.</p>

<p>“What? Are you trying to judge whether I have a pretty face or not?”</p>

<p>She’s overly generous with her smiles even to a guy she barely knows…</p>
<p>While feeling bewildered in that manner, I managed to squeeze out a genuine question.</p>

<p>“…but, Minacho-san, you don’t, uh… actually like me, do you?”</p>
<p>“Hmm… I don’t know.”</p>

<p>I don’t know?!</p>
<p>She doesn’t actually like me? Then why did she just confess to me?</p>

<p>“Of course, I don’t dislike you. If you asked me to kiss, I think I could totally do it, but well——I don’t think I’ve developed the desire to do it yet…Ahaha, sorry?”</p>
<p>“Why am I being confessed to, only to be rejected right after…? Is this some kind of paradox joke?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that! ——I mean, I really had a great time just now! So, I thought, maybe I could fall in love with you, and that’s why I asked you out!”</p>
<p>“What——?! So, even though you don’t like me, you confessed to me because you think you could fall in love with me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah!”</p>

<p>…Uh, do gals really have a lax sense of chastity?</p>
<p>Normally, confessing is something you do after you’ve developed feelings for someone, right?</p>
<p>Yet she spent the day with me and came to the conclusion that she could potentially like me — not that she actually like me — and then confessed to me.</p>

<p>…Isn’t the speed of her confession as fast as Formula 1?</p>
<p>I commute to school by bicycle, so I can’t keep up with her!</p>

<p>I felt again that I couldn’t understand gals at all…</p>
<p>For someone like me, the phrase ‘I want you to go out with me’ is a word that might never escape my lips for years.</p>
<p>It holds such weight, fear, and it’s something to be taken seriously.</p>

<p>However, she just casually said it without any fear or sentiment attached.</p>
<p>To her, it’s probably like a cute request, akin to asking a classmate, ‘Can you help me with my homework?’</p>
<p>Such is her sense, and while I won’t deny her conduct, I thought that she was different from me, like I felt that we’re different breeds of human.</p>
<p>So, after considering all that, the only response I could offer to her confession was this,</p>

<p>“I can’t go out with you, Minacho-san. I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>“Ah? Is that so, tensage…”</p>
<p>(TN: テンサゲ, tensage means a state of lowered tension. An abbreviation of ‘Tenshonsage’, which is a combination of ‘tenshon’ meaning a mood or feeling and ‘Sage’ meaning lowered. In english, maybe it was ‘buzzkill’ ? Idk.)</p>

<p>She says those words with a slightly sad expression.</p>
<p>Honestly, someone who’s genuinely sad wouldn’t say ‘tensage’, but still, she seemed somewhat shocked.</p>
<p>Then, she takes another sip of her frappuccino and after a satisfied ‘Mmm,’ she looks straight into my eyes.</p>

<p>“Well then, let’s be friends!”</p>
<p>“Don’t give up that easily!”</p>

<p>With a smile that seems entirely unaffected by the fact that she was just turned down, Tsumakawa presents a new request, and I respond with a quip.</p>
<p>I see, so this is the mindset of a gal… It’s positively scary for an introvert like me!</p>
<p>While I think that to myself, I voice my sincere feelings without holding back.</p>

<p>“Why are you so fixated on me, Tsumakawa-san?”</p>
<p>“..Hm? Tsumakawa-san? Did I mention my last name to you, Nezumayo-kun?”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“Huh? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa is surprised by my slip of the tongue.</p>
<p>In response, I consider that since it’s already out, there’s no point in hiding it any longer, and I explain our relationship.</p>

<p>“Tsumakawa-san might not have noticed, but we’re classmates in the same class…”</p>
<p>” …Ahaha, uh… Nezumayo-kun. You’re really funny, aren’t you? ——No way, that’s impossible. I mean, if you and I were in the same class, it’d be incredibly rude of me not to realize it. So, there’s no way that’s true…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Huh, no way… I said there’s no way that’s true! I like everyone in the class, so there’s no way I forget the faces of my classmates or anything like that——”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>” …really? “</p>

<p>Sensing that I’m telling the truth, Tsumakawa’s face turns pale.</p>
<p>Then, she clasps her hands together in an apologetic pose and bows her head vigorously.</p>

<p>“S-seriously? I’m so sorry, Nezumayo-kun… By the way, Nezumayo-kun, your name is, um… What kind of name is it?”</p>
<p>“…I’m Ryosuke Yoda, a first-year Class D student in Private Yuunagi High School.”</p>
<p>“…Ah… Oh, I see! Yoda! It’s Yoda! Why didn’t I notice?! Looking at you, you’re so Yoda! You really are that Yoda!”</p>
<p>“You’re too obvious!”</p>

<p>When I retorted like that, Tsumakawa-san apologized again with a serious tone.</p>

<p>“…uh, I’m really sorry.”</p>

<p>Honestly, there’s no need to feel so bad about it… Not many classmates can actually recognize me, probably less than half.</p>
<p>What a sad follow-up!</p>
<p>As I was scratching my cheek with a somewhat awkward expression, Tsumakawa suddenly raised her head and said:</p>

<p>“Uh… then, if Nezumayo-kun is in my class, from now on, I can discuss light novels with Nezumayo anytime in the classroom… How about that!?”</p>
<p>“Cut it out with these abrupt topic changes.”</p>
<p>“Huh, but seriously! If Yoda, my classmate, and Nezumayo are the same person, that means Minacho can talk freely with Nezumayo in class, right?! Hooray! I’ve won big time!”</p>
<p>“Don’t just declare victory like that on your own. Besides, having a class-related conversation when we’re not even friends——”</p>
<p>“Now about that, as I said before, if being a girlfriend is out of the question, then let’s be friends!”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa tries to steer the conversation back on track, repeating her request.</p>
<p>Not knowing how to respond, I’m left bewildered, and she continues.</p>

<p>“Nezumayo-kun, you seem like a serious guy, so I guess you can’t take dating lightly. Hmmph, my pride was hurt a little, but I’ll forgive you this time.”</p>
<p>“Why am I the one who needs forgiveness when I didn’t do anything wrong?”</p>
<p>“Then, being friends should be okay, right? Let’s become friends!”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Huh? You’re getting all quiet, what’s wrong?”</p>

<p>While letting Tsumakawa’s words wash over me, I take a deep breath.</p>
<p>Regarding this matter, while I do think that I might be the odd one, still… Due to certain two events, I’ve become unable to believe in ‘three-dimensional women,’ including her.</p>
<p>With that in mind, I said my response to Minacho-san, who I always enjoyed talking with on Twitter.</p>


<p>“I’m sorry, Minacho-san… Even being friends is a bit…”</p>
<p>“Haaaa!? You’re way too stubborn! I’m going to turn into a demon and be so mad at you! “</p>
<p>“Can you not suddenly being so intimidating and getting unreasonably angry?”</p>

<p>The white gal says something frightening in an intense tone, and my honest emotions slip out.</p>
<p>Then, she crosses her arms and gives me a stern look.</p>

<p>“Won’t you explain the reason?”</p>

<p>So, I reluctantly started to tell my own story, something I don’t really want to talk about.</p>
<p>“Actually, I’m somewhat skeptical about women… There were two events that led to this—first, when I was in my first year of middle school. An idol I was supporting along with my sister suddenly announced on Twitter, ‘I’m getting married and retiring as an idol!’</p>
<p>“Huh, that’s great news. You should be supportive.”</p>
<p>“What’s so great about it? It’s a marriage announcement and a retirement announcement at the same time! Our Yuna-chan, who we were cheering for as an idol, is quitting the idol world! And what’s more, she was in a no-dating group, but she’s been in a full-blown romance since her active days! That handsome actor is seriously unforgivable…”</p>
<p>“Your expression is way too intense. But hey, isn’t it normal for your favorite idol to eventually get married? How much did Nezumayo like that idol?”</p>
<p>“Enough to gather all the dragon’s ball.”</p>
<p>“Like being able to fulfill the impossible demands Princess Kaguya made to the prince who proposed to her in ‘The Tale of the Bamboo Cutter’!?”</p>

<p>After I retorted like that, Tsumakawa laughed out loud and replied with a gleeful voice.</p>
<p>Stop it, don’t laugh. That wasn’t a joke just now.</p>
<p>Really, I was dead serious about being able to do that!</p>

<p>“That incident led me to firmly resolve that I wouldn’t believe in three-dimensional women——however, I fell for the female artist 『ArlSU』 soon after.”</p>
<p>“Your resolution collapsed way too quickly! Sounds like a two-panel manga.”</p>
<p>“No, unlike idols, it’s not like I fell for a female artist based on her appearance! I just like ArlSU’s songs, and since my feelings for ArlSU aren’t romantic, I’m not making the same mistake again! You know, I’ve learned from my failures!”</p>
<p>“Well, then…? If you’re not into her and simply become a fan, then it’s not a big deal, right?”</p>
<p>“Anyway, that’s how I started to promote the singer ArlSU… And then, two years later, she said on a radio show, [I seriously can’t get a boyfriend, someone please take me!] However, soon after that, she got caught having an affair with a big company’s president, and it became a hot topic on the internet…”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“That was the moment. That’s when I decided I’d never expect anything from three-dimensional women ever again.”</p>
<p>“Looks like you were really into her, huh?”</p>

<p>She made a precise remark. Well, maybe.</p>
<p>I actually was never a fan because of her face, but when ArlSU’s affair scandal came out, I felt the same way as when Yuna betrayed me! Damn it!</p>

<p>“Well… after going through such experiences twice, I… I couldn’t trust real-life women anymore because women will betray me. That’s why I don’t need a girlfriend or female friends. I decided not to get involved with real-life women, and, in return, I’ll only pour my love into the two-dimensional girlfriends living in the world of fiction…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“That’s the reason I can’t be friends with you… I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>After talking at length, I told her again, and I quietly bowed my head.</p>
<p>Honestly speaking, it is a story that is hard to be understood by others, but I was that invested, and that’s the truth. So, when I was feeling betrayed, I was genuinely hurt.</p>
<p>The love I offered and the love I received were completely imbalanced. What I offered was a genuine devotion, and yet what came back felt like a paper lantern.</p>
<p>I couldn’t bear the fact that what I gave was real and substantial, but what I received was hollow…</p>

<p>As I continued to pile up these thoughts, the gal in front of me carefully chose her words and spoke.</p>

<p>“Well, that’s just because you’re into some stupid celebrity. Whether we become friends or not, those things doesn’t matter, right? — Miona won’t deceive you, so let’s become friends.”</p>
<p>“I know that in my head… But, due to the experiences that have piled up inside me, I… I’m scared of becoming friends with three-dimensional girls…”</p>
<p>” …. “</p>
<p>“I can’t separate these thoughts. To me, the two I supported and the women around me… They look like the same kind of beings. That’s why I’m scared. I feel like I don’t want you to get any closer… uh, I know it sounds pathetic.”</p>
<p>” …hmm, I see. Well then, no worries. ——yosh-yosh.”</p>

<p>I don’t know what part of what I just said convinced her.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Tsumakawa, as if she understood something, began to pat my head.</p>

<p>“Huh—? Don’t act like you’re my grandma!”</p>
<p>“Why grandma? At least say I’m your mom.”</p>

<p>While Tsumakawa-san was retorting me, I turned my head away and escaped her hand.</p>
<p>Despite just having talked about being uncomfortable around women, she’s making this move… Gals are terrifying…</p>
<p>As I was thinking that, Tsumakawa gave a mischievous smile after seeing my awkward expression.</p>

<p>“For now, let’s head back soon. —How about we take the train together?”</p>
<p>“Ah, alright…”</p>

<p>With that conversation, Tsumakawa and I left the cafe.</p>
<p>Then, without saying anything to each other, we arrived at Shibuya Station.</p>
<p>We passed through the ticket gate, boarded the Shonan-Shinjuku Line, and amid a crowded train——</p>

<p>“It’s really packed…”</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>

<p>That was the only conversation we had until we reached my nearest station, ‘Saitama Shintoshin Station.’</p>

<p>“Well then, this is my stop.”</p>

<p>Today was fun, but from now on, I can return to my usual, unrelated relationship with Tsumakawa-san, I thought as I got off the train.</p>
<p>At the same time, she smiled and waved her hand at me and says,</p>

<p>“Let’s hang out again sometime!”</p>
<p>“Huh… Hang out again…?”</p>
<p>“Bye-bye! Gal peace!”</p>

<p>With a smile on her face, Tsumakawa-san made a ‘Gal peace’ gesture, making a peace sign with both hands, then turning it upside down with fingertips pointing downward.</p>
<p>She continued this until the doors closed… and eventually, the train, carrying the mischievously smiling white gal, gained speed and moving away departing from the station.</p>

<p>“…I told you we can’t be friends, so there shouldn’t be a next time…”</p>

<p>Although I dazedly retorted like that, the train had already gone far beyond my sight…so there was no way that she could hear me.</p>
