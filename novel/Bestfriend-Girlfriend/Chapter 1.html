<h2>Chapter 1: In the Depths of Desperation</h2>

<p>Five years later.</p>



<p>“Guh… ahhhhh! Uhhhhhh!”</p>



<p>In a dark forest during the day, I ran desperately, clutching my injured right arm.</p>



<p>With the tremendous pain coming from the wound, it’s possible that I might lose consciousness.</p>



<p>But if I faint here, I will definitely die. I’ll be killed. The screams coming from my mouth were also spells necessary to keep me conscious.</p>



<p>What’s chasing me is a giant insect about three meters long.</p>



<p>Compound red eyes, black legs, and transparent wings moving at an unstoppable speed.</p>



<p>By its appearance, it’s a monster called the lord of flies.</p>



<p>It’s a monster that would require strong adventurers and a group of knights to face it—-in other words, an adventurer of the lowest class has no chance at all.</p>



<p>Blood, sweat, tears, and nasal secretions. Fear makes my fluids leave my body. If looked at from one side, it would be quite unpleasant.</p>



<p>I was aware of that, but the fear of being chased by this enormous monster is hard to overcome. While crying like a child, I thought about it as I fled. It wasn’t supposed to be like this.</p>



<p>Five years ago, after being expelled from my homeland, I became an adventurer. As an adventurer, I would defeat monsters, protect people, and make a name for myself so that my father and the others would recognize me.</p>



<p>At that time, if I had grown as I had imagined, I would have faced the lord of flies with the illusionary sword style by now.</p>



<p>However, reality is, as usual, the opposite of expectations.</p>



<p>Instead of protecting people by defeating monsters, I’m running to save my life.</p>



<p>Furthermore, I didn’t stumble upon this monster accidentally. Others were the ones who caused this.</p>



<p>I was deceived by those I thought were my companions. My bloodied right arm wasn’t caused by the lord of flies, but by human hands.</p>



<p>Remembering that fact, emotions separate from fear welled up from within my throat.</p>



<p>“Those! Those! Damn it!”</p>



<p>I imagined that I might die fighting monsters. But I never imagined that I would be used as bait and end up like this.</p>



<p>I chose the path of being an adventurer to make my father and the others recognize me, but that wasn’t all.</p>



<p>Being an adventurer was the most suitable occupation for the secret of protection established by the style of the illusionary sword.</p>



<p>So, I knocked on the guild door of adventurers.</p>



<p>I wanted to help everyone. I wanted to be someone who could protect others. I became an adventurer thinking about that. But is this the result? I don’t think so.</p>



<p>I refuse to believe it. As I screamed, I heard a loud buzzing sound from behind.</p>



<p>When I looked, the four wings on the back of the lord of flies were flapping violently.</p>



<p>It seems it resorted to drastic measures to prevent its prey from escaping.</p>



<p>Considering the balance between the enormous monster and its four wings, it would practically be impossible for it to fly, but its massive body floated in the air.</p>



<p>Being in the air without obstacles, the monster lunged. I thought about dodging it, but it was already too late.</p>



<p>I was sent flying by the tremendous roar and impact, and my body flew through the air like trash.</p>



<p>There was no sense of fear or pain. However, the floating sensation that lasted forever was extremely delicate.</p>



<p>After a while of drifting, intense pain screamed throughout my body.</p>



<p>“Gahhhhhhhhhhhh!”</p>



<p>I rolled on the muddy ground of the forest. How much time passed until the pain subsided? Upon noticing it, there was a lot of mud in my mouth.</p>



<p>“Guah… Agah…”</p>



<p>I struggled to my feet, spitting out the mud from my mouth. But as soon as I stood up, a sharp pain surged through my right arm, causing my body to lose balance.</p>



<p>As a result, I fell back into the mud I had just spit out. An unpleasant sensation stuck to my cheek. The foul smell pierced my nose.</p>



<p>“Ahhhhhhhhhhh! Why? Why?! Damn it!”</p>



<p>I shouted hoarsely, over and over again. Doing so would attract the attention of the monsters, but I had no space for such thoughts anymore.</p>



<p>In that moment, a shiver ran down my spine, and I looked back.</p>



<p>–Surprisingly, the lord of flies was there. Its compound eyes were fixed on me.</p>



<p>I suddenly became startled. I realized something. The monster wasn’t chasing its prey; it was merely toying with it.</p>



<p>If it truly wanted to kill me, I would have been shredded from the beginning.</p>



<p>The lord of flies doesn’t do it because it waits for its prey to weaken.</p>



<p>In that case, why bother going through all this trouble?</p>



<p>Suddenly, I remembered the characteristics of the lord of flies that I had read in a record earlier.</p>



<p>The reason the lord of flies is considered a disaster-class monster is due to its incredible reproductive system.</p>



<p>If the adult is left unchecked, it will produce countless larvae that will swiftly destroy the local ecosystem.</p>



<p>This ecosystem includes that of humans, and there have even been records of entire countries being devastated in the past.</p>



<p>The record stated that the lord of flies’ method of reproduction is the same as that of certain bees.</p>



<p>It uses the venom from its tail to paralyze humans and large beasts, and then transports them alive to the nest to feed the larvae.</p>



<p>If the lord of flies captures me, I will be devoured alive.</p>



<p>“Uhhhh…!”</p>



<p>I want to escape. However, my legs won’t respond. It’s like a frog swallowed by a snake. It seems the monster thought it had weakened me enough as it approached.</p>



<p>A scream erupted from the depths of my throat. In the next moment, the pointed tail of the lord of flies pierced me from the side.</p>



<p>I felt the pain in an instant, quickly replaced by numbness. The numbness spread rapidly throughout my body.</p>



<p>–Why did all this happen?</p>



<p>Before losing consciousness, the last thing that crossed my mind was that incident that occurred in the adventurer’s guild three days ago.</p>



<p>“Tenth-class adventurer, Sora-sama. I’m sorry to say, but your status as an adventurer has been revoked.”</p>



<p>“…..Huh?”</p>



<p>That day, a guild receptionist said that with a slightly pitiful tone. In other words, I was being fired.</p>



<p>I stood there with my mouth hanging open. It was so sudden that I didn’t know what was happening.</p>



<p>“…Is this a joke, right?”</p>



<p>“No, this is an official notice approved by the guild master. Here’s the notification.”</p>



<p>I carefully took the document with a trembling hand.</p>



<p>It stated that the tenth-class adventurer, Sora, was being fired, and the guild master’s seal was also imprinted.</p>



<p>Not metaphorically, but my heart ached. I wondered, for what reason? Why was I suddenly fired?</p>



<p>Just today, I had finished collecting herbs, which was a daily routine.</p>



<p>Since it was in the required amount, there was no need to divide it.</p>



<p>I don’t remember doing anything wrong in other requests. In that case, why am I being fired? As I thought about it, I wore an angry expression in front of the receptionist.</p>



<p>The words came out more subdued than I had expected.</p>



<p>The receptionist, who couldn’t have been older than 20, sighed. As time passed, I could see through her disgruntled heart.</p>



<p>“No, it’s not a mistake. The guild rules state that those who haven’t been promoted for three years will be expelled. In Sora-sama’s case, he has remained in the tenth class since being demoted from the ninth class three years ago, right? In that case, the condition is fulfilled.”</p>



<p>“…..Ah, I-Is that so? I didn’t know. They could have given me a warning…”</p>



<p>“I’ll say it again, what I just mentioned is clearly established in the guild rules. If you didn’t know, it’s your own negligence. The guild has no obligation to give a warning.”</p>



<p>Uwaa, it’s the first time the receptionist looks directly at me.</p>



<p>Naturally, I get lost in that gaze that mixes anger and disdain.</p>



<p>“In the city of Ishka, several preferential treatments are offered to adventurers. This is because the power of adventurers is required to protect the city, which is constantly under threat from monsters. If you’re an adventurer or a member of this guild’s staff, you should be aware that you have an obligation to work for Ishka.”</p>



<p>“Well, I know that, but…”</p>



<p>It’s not a lie. That’s precisely why I settled in this city. Protecting this city from the threat of monsters will benefit the world and its people. I could even gain fame. What I couldn’t do on the island, I could do in this city. I swore.</p>



<p>…..Now, I think that oath was as far as the moon in the sky.</p>



<p>Upon hearing my words, the receptionist’s eyes gleamed coldly.</p>



<p>“If you knew that, shouldn’t you have tried to get promoted in the last three years? First of all, the promotion to the ninth class is not difficult. You know that more than anyone, as you were once promoted to the ninth class five years ago.”</p>



<p>“But, money was a bit…”</p>



<p>“The fee for promotion to the ninth rank is one silver coin. Are you telling me that you couldn’t earn one silver coin in three years? Meanwhile, were you enjoying the privileges granted to adventurers? Privileges are granted only to those who fulfill their duties. Even children know that.”</p>



<p>“Uhh…”</p>



<p>“Anyway, rules are rules. Expulsion is final. Furthermore, with all that being said, I can’t help but think that Sora-sama’s expulsion is appropriate.”</p>



<p>A rain filled with righteousness came out of the receptionist’s mouth. My objection stayed as it was, and I was left stammering.</p>



<p>Seeing me in that state, it seems she thought it’s just a waste of time, so she continued speaking with a somewhat terrible voice.</p>



<p>“This is the reward for today’s mission. I hope you have good luck in the future. Next, please.”</p>



<p>“Wa—-“</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>I was left with my mouth hanging open before I could finish speaking. But, the receptionist was no longer looking at me. The adventurers waiting their turn had looks of “Move already.”</p>



<p>All of them are higher in rank and level. I couldn’t help but shrink my shoulders. Also, I couldn’t help but laugh at my pathetic nature.</p>



<p>Now that this happened, I tried using my last resort.</p>



<p>To say a few words to the receptionist—–I thought of that, but being young and beautiful, she is very popular among adventurers.</p>



<p>If I were to curse at her, it wouldn’t be strange for the other adventurers to hit me.</p>



<p>After all, I had to leave the reception counter.</p>



<p>Normally, after completing a mission, I would go to the guild’s dining hall with the reward and ask for a drink of beer. But, I wasn’t in the mood right now.</p>



<p>“She didn’t give me back my identification card…..it seems she’s serious”</p>



<p>A silver-white seal is presented when reporting the completion of a request—–but she didn’t give me back my identification card.</p>



<p>The identification card is not only something that guarantees the status of an adventurer, but it is also something that must be presented when exercising your rights as an adventurer.</p>



<p>In other words, I can’t access my adventurer benefits without it.</p>



<p>The city of Ishka, also known as the Free City and City of Adventures, is constantly threatened by monsters. Naturally, the knights and soldiers who serve the country protect the city, but they heavily rely on adventurers for their strength, and preferential treatment for adventurers is implemented as an urban policy. It’s just as the receptionist said.</p>



<p>The benefits range from discounted weapon and armor purchases to daily accommodation, and without the identification card, the cost of living will increase by over 30%.</p>



<p>The identification card is supposed to be given along with the mission report and returned together with the reward.</p>



<p>And since she didn’t give it back, it seems that it wasn’t a joke or harassment from the receptionist.</p>



<p>At this point, I finally felt that I had been expelled from the adventurers’ guild. Without work, there will be no income.</p>



<p>I have no savings. Until now, living expenses have been reduced in the guild’s dining hall and the inn for adventurers, but somehow it was enough.</p>



<p>It won’t be possible anymore starting tomorrow. I left the adventurers’ guild building dumbfounded. It’s an organization I stayed with for five years.</p>



<p>Although it was the last day, no one stopped me, no one talked to me, no one will miss me. It’s as if it’s repeating what happened five years ago.</p>



<p>Unintentionally, a dry laughter spills out of my mouth. That’s what made me laugh.</p>



<p>I woke up the day after I was expelled from the guild, staying in a room with two copper coins and no food.</p>



<p>The cramped interior of the room is furnished with wooden planks, but there was no door at the entrance, so I could easily look into the room from the hallway.</p>



<p>And how should I put it, the walls of the room are very thin. Last night, the tenant in the room to the right snored loudly, and from the room on the left, I could hear the moans of a prostitute, so I couldn’t sleep well.</p>



<p>The only salvation is probably the spring season. If it were winter, I could have frozen to death. That’s how horrible the room was.</p>



<p>I woke up feeling extremely unwell. Needless to say, I didn’t stay at such an inn by choice.</p>



<p>Until last night, I stayed at a guild provider. A cozy but small inn, with a firm owner and his cheerful daughter.</p>



<p>They told me to leave, and I moved to this cheap inn.</p>







<p>“”There’s no place here for non-adventurers,” huh?…..Ahh…..”</p>



<p>I struck the floor of the room with my fist, where the exposed earth was.</p>



<p>They knew about my expulsion case. Surely the guild must have spread it around.</p>



<p>The inn’s daughter, who was kind to me until yesterday, said this with a calm face.</p>



<p>“”Thank you for everything until now. When you come, make sure to have at least something like a tip.””</p>



<p>Apparently, I was the only one who felt welcomed, on the other side it was different, she seems to despise customers who couldn’t even give a tip.</p>



<p>I really liked the owner’s personality and his daughter, that’s why I kept living there, but it was only superficial.</p>



<p>Maybe it’s my fault. No, it is. I understand that. However, why do they have to look at me with those eyes of disdain, both at the guild and at the inn?</p>



<p>While doing this, I remembered the looks from the receptionist and the inn’s daughter. It made me angry.</p>



<p>Driven by anger, I attempted to punch the wall, but quickly stopped myself. I realized that I could easily punch through the thin wall.</p>



<p>If I destroy the wall, it’s obvious that I would have to pay several times the cost of repairs.</p>



<p>It would be truly foolish to diminish the little money I have for something like this.</p>



<p>“…..The troubles are just beginning.”</p>



<p>I checked my money. If I gather the silver and copper coins, I could somehow manage for a month.</p>



<p>However, it’s a month calculated with the minimum accommodation and food. Improving the situation was an urgent necessity. If I want a minimum salary, I could do cleaning jobs.</p>



<p>However, if I do daily jobs, I will never become strong and won’t be accepted.</p>



<p>Well, herb gathering was practically the same, but it was still a guild request.</p>



<p>It was risky to go out, but I felt like I was helping others.</p>



<p>But there is no such thing as working within safe walls.</p>



<p>If I get used to that environment, it would be affirming Ayaka’s words from five years ago, “Just drop your sword and live peacefully.” I vehemently refused that.</p>



<p>It’s true. There is no rule that says if you don’t belong to the guild, you can’t defeat monsters or help people.</p>



<p>It shouldn’t matter if you kill monsters or gather herbs without going through the guild.</p>



<p>By not going through the guild, it’s inevitable that my tracks won’t be followed, but it’s still better than doing cleaning jobs.</p>



<p>That behavior is commonly known as a “lost adventurer” and is identified as an unreliable or vagrant person. I knew that, but I didn’t care.</p>



<p>I think it would be more interesting that way. I’ll make the receptionist and the inn’s people regret having expelled me.</p>



<p>Originally, I didn’t receive good treatment from the guild. I knew that other adventurers and receptionists called me a “parasite” behind the scenes.</p>



<p>I think it would be better to think of this as a good opportunity to stay away from the guild and the adventurers. I let out a small laugh.</p>



<p>—–And then, I sighed.</p>



<p>I had to realize that my thinking was an escape from reality.</p>



<p>“”Level Open””</p>



<p>I used magic to display my level. The number that appeared was “1” as usual.</p>



<p>No matter how much training I do, how many battles I have, I can’t level up.</p>



<p>I looked at that unmoving number as if it were cursed and distorted my face.</p>



<p>The level is the measure of human talent. And power is proportional to an individual’s strength. Naturally, the higher the level, the more power there will be. Generally, the level increases by 10, but in the case of those who live for battle, “Fighting stronger opponents” is considered an important factor for leveling up.</p>



<p>They could defeat dozens or hundreds of strong monsters, but the level wouldn’t increase.</p>



<p>On the contrary, a weak person has the opportunity to level up. In that sense, people with level “1” tend to level up more easily.</p>



<p>However, here is someone who can’t achieve it. Someone who has never been able to level up on the island or in the city.</p>



<p>Many would think it’s strange, but in fact, there is a theory that could explain this phenomenon.</p>



<p>Talent limit.</p>



<p>Humans have their limits. 300 years ago, the master swordsman who sealed the demon god seems to have reached level “99,” but couldn’t go beyond that.</p>



<p>If the legendary hero had his limits, there’s no reason why there wouldn’t be limits for other humans. Also, depending on the level that is reached, there will equally be a limit.</p>



<p>In other words, it’s not surprising if there is a human whose level “1” is the limit.</p>



<p>Before, I had to distance myself from my companions with whom I had gone on adventures because of the level difference.</p>



<p>More specifically, I was expelled from the group.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Just like my younger brother and my fiancée, my companions cast me aside.</p>
<p>For those who don’t improve their level, the talent limit was synonymous with despair, but they couldn’t give up.</p>
<p>In that case, they must have had the same reason. Furthermore, it’s not that there is no hope. Only the current level can be confirmed using the “Level Open” magic, but whether there is a talent limit or a lack of experience cannot be confirmed.</p>
<p>In other words, no one knows if the reason why the level doesn’t increase is the talent limit or the lack of experience.</p>
<p>Those who didn’t pass the test on the island couldn’t participate in real battles.</p>
<p>By becoming an adventurer and going through a real battle, the level should also increase—five years ago, when I became an adventurer, I had hoped for that.</p>
<p>But the reality was cruel. No matter how many monsters I defeated, how many bandits I killed, my level didn’t increase.</p>
<p>Even though my companions and I defeated the same enemy, completed the same mission, ate the same food, their levels kept increasing. There was a big gap.</p>
<p>The level number is important personal information, even within the same group.</p>
<p>However, they openly revealed their own levels. By doing that, those who complain a lot about levels would stay silent.</p>
<p>I thought it would be a matter of time for me, so I chose a day and showed them my level.</p>
<p>I had a good relationship with the members, and the leader was like a friend. So, I thought they would understand.</p>
<p>—–However, I only received painful abuse.</p>
<p>They called me a swindler and kicked me out of the group.</p>
<p>The act of a low-level adventurer hiding in a high-level group is called a “parasite” and is despised.</p>
<p>I had no such intentions—more specifically, I intended to confess before being judged. But for the group members, this act was nothing more than parasitism.</p>
<p>This was four and a half years ago. It was from that moment that I was called a “parasite.”</p>
<p>The infamous name of parasite has spread, as well as the fact that my level is “1,” and probably also the fact that I’ve reached the talent limit.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve been working alone. There was no way to have a level “1” parasite adventurer in a group. There were limited solo missions available. And those few missions had copper rewards. There wouldn’t even be minimal savings.</p>
<p>Without money, I couldn’t buy weapons and armor. It was a vicious circle where the number of requests that could be received decreased.</p>
<p>Three years ago, the reason I was downgraded from the ninth class was that the middle class had lower payments to the guild.</p>
<p>Until then, I had remained in the ninth class, but I couldn’t afford to do so anymore.</p>
<p>After that, I no longer had the will to get promoted to the ninth class again or give the money to do it, and then yesterday, the guild notification arrived.</p>
<p>That was my entire situation.</p>
<p>“H-Hey, you, would you like to join our group?”</p>
<p>It was about a month after I became an adventurer in the city of Ishka when I heard those words. The boy’s name is Lars.</p>
<p>A boy who chose the path of an adventurer when he was tired of a poor life and wanted wealth and fame.</p>
<p>A very common reason, and that smile was friendly towards people.</p>
<p>“Wait! It’s rude to say “you” when you talk to someone!”</p>
<p>The girl who scolded Lars is named Iria. Lars’ childhood friend, she’s skilled in martial arts and healing magic she learned from her mother, who was a warrior priestess.</p>
<p>As for Iria, wealth and fame were secondary, and it seems she accompanied Lars, who left his village.</p>
<p>She seemed strong with sharp eyes, and her appearance with her long black hair tied in a ponytail reminded me of my ex-fiancée.</p>
<p>“I think it would be ruder to start a senseless fight”</p>
<p>A pointed hat and a staff. A girl dressed like a mage sighed as if she were surprised.</p>
<p>The girl’s name is Miroslav, characterized by her flame-red hair and freckles on her face.</p>
<p>She seemed to come from a good family, wearing a silk cloak and holding a staff with a large magic stone.</p>
<p>She also wore other expensive accessories like earrings and bracelets.</p>





<p>“Please, let’s calm down. This person is also in trouble, right?” Luna María, a girl with long ears, looked at the three of them with a complicated expression.</p>
<p>She was an elf, a talented hunter and also a wise one.</p>
<p>Five years ago, Lars and Iria were 13 years old, and Miroslav was 14.</p>
<p>In a group that was too young, the elf was like the pillar in various ways, and about her age, she said, “It’s a secret, hehe~”.</p>
<p>The name of the group was “Falcon Sword”.</p>
<p>It was a rank G, a newly formed group that was looking for another member to serve as the vanguard. To be honest, I initially declined the offer.</p>
<p>Although I was happy to be invited, the memories I had with Ayaka and the others still lingered, and I was afraid of being with others.</p>
<p>But Lars invited me enthusiastically.</p>
<p>“Please! You see, I saw you at the training center before. You swung your sword tirelessly for hours, and I thought the way you did it was wonderful.”</p>
<p>Faced with Lars pressing me like that, I finally gave in. Well, more than giving in, I was very happy that he said all that.</p>
<p>The adventures with them were simple and enjoyable. Although I would be expelled from the group in less than half a year, those days were a lot of fun.</p>
<p>As I mentioned earlier, I was expelled from the group. Miroslav called me a parasite to my face, Iria hit me hard with her words of blame.</p>
<p>Lars was silent, but there was a disappointment that he couldn’t hide in his eyes.</p>
<p>Only Luna Maria didn’t try to do that, but the pity and sympathy she sent me were more painful than the three of them combined.</p>
<p>Since then, “Falcon Sword” has increased its group rank to rank C.</p>
<p>Currently, there is no rank A group in the Ishka Adventurers Guild, and rank B is the highest. If there are only three rank B groups, you can see Lars and the others’ progress.</p>
<p>My former comrades who became strong adventurers.</p>
<p>By residing in the same city, I had the opportunity to meet them—</p>
<p>“What are you doing here?”</p>
<p>Three days after being expelled from the Adventurers Guild. In other words, the day the Lord of the Flies attacked.</p>
<p>As usual, when I was collecting herbs in the Tittis Forest, north of Ishka, someone suddenly spoke to me from behind.</p>
<p>I remembered that voice full of pity and sympathy. In hindsight, when I turned around, the person I imagined was there. When I frowned, that person placed her hand on her hip and swung her breasts.</p>
<p>“Hmph. What’s with that face? If you have something to say, why don’t you say it? Let’s see what the parasite who hid his talent limit and leached off us for half a year has to say.”</p>
<p>A woman with a pointed hat and a staff. Her flaming red hair protruded from her hat, and those topaz-colored eyes shone brightly.</p>
<p>It was Miroslav, the mage of “Falcon Sword.” The girl who used to worry about her freckles had grown beautifully in five years.</p>
<p>However, no matter how beautiful she was, that charm wouldn’t be felt if she was so brazen. While thinking that, Miroslav snorted.</p>
<p>“Can’t say anything? That’s right. Because everything I’m saying is the truth—”</p>
<p>When Miroslav tried to continue, a voice resonated to stop her in her tracks.</p>
<p>“Miro, that’s enough.”</p>
<p>It was Lars who interrupted. The leader of the rank C group “Falcon Sword” personally climbed to the sixth class at the age of 18.</p>
<p>Whether it was rank C or the sixth class, it was very rare in the history of adventurers over 10 years.</p>
<p>Lars, who achieved it before the age of 20 five years ago, was recognized as a promising adventurer.</p>
<p>…..I became an adventurer at the same age and at the same time, but I realized there was a big difference.</p>
<p>Lars stared at me. That smile he once had was nowhere to be seen on his lips.</p>
<p>“I heard you got expelled from the guild, Sora,” he said.</p>
<p>“…..Yes,” I replied.</p>
<p>“Your level is still the same, isn’t it? If you’re still here, it means you still intend to work as an adventurer, but it would be better for you to stop. It’s too late once something happens,” he warned.</p>
<p>“…..Thanks for the advice,” I gave a vague response to his words. Then, a beautiful woman with black hair standing next to Lars spoke up, frowning.</p>
<p>“Hey! What’s with that attitude? Lars took the trouble to give you advice,” Iria, in her white combat attire, exclaimed. She used to be a girl with sharp eyes, but like Miroslav, she has become incredibly beautiful over the past five years.</p>
<p>It seems those eyes that only see Lars haven’t changed in five years.</p>
<p>“…..I apologize,” I said.</p>
<p>“…..You’re as listless as ever. I thought you were a bit better when we first met,” she replied.</p>
<p>“It’s okay, Iria. Anyway, it’s no longer our concern. If he dies despite my advice, then he simply brought it upon himself,” Lars interjected.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“As Lars said, let’s forget about this person and enter the forest already. I don’t know if it’s just my imagination, but he smells like a homeless who hasn’t bathed in three days,” Miroslav added.</p>
<p>“Hey, Miro. You were the one who spoke to me first,” I pointed out.</p>
<p>As they said whatever they wanted, Lars and the others disappeared into the forest.</p>
<p>The one who remained was the elf, Luna Maria.</p>
<p>“I’m glad to see you’re okay, Sora-san,” she said, bowing. The gentle smile she gave resembled the one from before.</p>
<p>Elves are generally proud and distrustful of strangers, but Luna Maria was like an exception, and sometimes I wondered who, among her, Miroslav, and Iria, was helping the group.</p>
<p>When I joined the “Falcon’s Sword,” in the midst of preparations and conducting transactions together, to be honest, I felt drawn to her.</p>
<p>After realizing that her gaze was chasing after Lars like the other two, I carefully controlled my emotions.</p>
<p>Her attitude didn’t change even when we weren’t leveling up in the group, so I was grateful for that at the time.</p>
<p>But now, I’m surprised.</p>
<p>After I was expelled from the group, I overheard an interesting conversation in a bar.</p>
<p>That this elf was the one who started the nickname “Parasite.”</p>
<p>After briefly responding to her words with a “Thank you,” Luna Maria turned her back to avoid further conversation.</p>
<p>I could sense a doubtful signal from behind, but I didn’t care. I didn’t want a conversation of pity and sympathy.</p>
<p>Ignoring me, she went off with her beloved Lars. That’s what I really thought. However, my intention didn’t appear, but a voice, like shaking a bell, came from her back.</p>
<p>“In recent days, many people have gone missing in the Tittis Forest. Be very careful, Sora-san,” she warned.</p>
<p>“…..Disappearances?” I unexpectedly looked back over my shoulder. Then, Luna Maria nodded with a bit of relief.</p>
<p>The Tittis Forest is so vast that it could swallow up an entire country, and there are rumors that mystical creatures inhabit its deepest parts.</p>
<p>Because of that, there have been many cases where adventurers who entered the forest never returned.</p>
<p>However, even taking that into account, the number of people who have gone missing in recent days seems abnormal.</p>
<p>Moreover, some of those who disappeared are C-rank groups like the “Falcon’s Sword,” and the guild has decided to send high-rank groups to investigate the cause. The “Falcon’s Sword” is one of them.</p>
<p>Luna Maria warned me to be careful because the forest is currently dangerous.</p>
<p>Honestly, I wanted to tell her that I didn’t need her concern, but I managed to keep my composure.</p>
<p>“…..I will. Thanks for the advice,” I replied.</p>
<p>“You’re welcome. Well then, I’ll take my leave,” Luna Maria said, and like her comrades, she disappeared into the forest.</p>
<p>Relieved to be done with this unwanted reunion with my former companions, I resumed gathering herbs.</p>
<p>I was curious about the missing people as Luna Maria mentioned. Regardless of the depths of the forest, there shouldn’t be any problems in the outer periphery.</p>
<p>In fact, if the number of adventurers approaching the forest decreases in this case, the price of herb collection will increase.</p>
<p>That expectation touched my heart. No one could complain about that.</p>
<p>—But I never would have imagined that Lars and the others would be attacked by the lord of flies and return, luring it back with them.</p>
<p>What’s more, Miroslav attacked me with his magic to redirect the monster’s attention towards the injured – me.</p>
<p>I hated the name Sora (sky). Every time they said my name, I felt like they were calling me empty. </p>
<p>T/N: kanji for 空 can be read as Sora (sky) or Kara (empty)</p>
<p>No, actually, they did say that at that moment. It was when I lost against my younger brother Raguna in a practice at the dojo. Raguna himself said, “It’s the same as always.”</p>
<p>But it wasn’t just Raguna, it was also the other apprentices.</p>
<p>“It really is Kara. He’s completely empty.”</p>
<p>“I feel sorry for Raguna for having such a weak, empty older brother. No matter how you look at it, Raguna is better.”</p>
<p>When I was seven years old. When the difference with Raguna, Ayaka, and the other apprentices became clear, those looks from around me—especially when my father started looking at me coldly.</p>
<p>Why did they give me this name? I asked my mother. She kindly embraced her pathetic son and took me to the courtyard.</p>
<p>My mother was a sickly person.</p>
<p>It seems she was sick from the beginning, but it became particularly noticeable after giving birth to me, and she spent half a year resting.</p>
<p>Her room, the mansion, and the courtyard. That was her entire world.</p>
<p>Perhaps because of that, my mother liked looking at the sky.</p>
<p>She liked the sunny sky.</p>
<p>She liked the cloudy sky.</p>
<p>She liked the sky at dawn and dusk.</p>
<p>She liked the rainy sky—she couldn’t walk in the garden on rainy days, and I think she laughed a bit as if she hated that.</p>
<p>Still, I knew her loving feelings were greater when she looked at my mother’s face gazing at the rain clouds.</p>
<p>No matter where or when, when looking up, there it was. All kinds of faces were shown.</p>
<p>The people you cherish who are far away are looking at the same sky.</p>
<p>They are connected under the same sky. Thinking that, one doesn’t feel lonely.</p>
<p>My mother loved looking at the sky, so when she gave birth to me, she said the first name that came to her mind was Sora.</p>
<p>“I want you to be a person as vast as this sky,” she placed such a wish.</p>
<p>“You see, Sora,” addressing her crying son, although she was still speaking, my mother mischievously smiled.</p>
<p>“The word “empty” isn’t necessarily something bad. If there’s nothing, then you can be anything. From now on, gather many things from yourself and become whatever you want to be. No matter what you become, I will always bless the path you choose.”</p>





<p>“Where am I…?” </p>
<p>As I came to, I found myself lying in an unfamiliar place.</p>
<p>Having a nostalgic dream, I hoped that perhaps someone had saved me.</p>
<p>The area was completely dark, and I couldn’t grasp the situation, but at least there were no signs of the lord of flies.</p>
<p>Relieved by that fact, I tried to get up.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“Huh…?” </p>
<p>My body didn’t move. A strong numbness hindered the movement of my limbs.</p>
<p>I could barely move my head freely, but I couldn’t even budge a finger from my neck down.</p>
<p>I was taken aback by a sensation I had never felt before. And speaking of surprises, where does this sound come from?</p>
<p>A sound like something hard breaking.</p>
<p>A sound like soft and soggy chewing.</p>
<p>A sound like touching something sticky.</p>
<p>It was not a reassuring sound. Unable to see anything, fear grew.</p>
<p>I desperately tried to move away from the source of the sound, but my numb body wouldn’t budge.</p>
<p>At that moment, a light entered my field of vision, which was enveloped in darkness. It was the moonlight descending from above.</p>
<p>Illuminated by the moonlight, the full image of where I am now becomes clear.</p>
<p>It was a vast space that could easily fit a small mansion. Rocky surface. There was no evidence of human manipulation, so it appears to be a natural cave.</p>
<p>However, although it is a cave, there is no side hole serving as an entrance.</p>
<p>To get out of here, I would have to go through the hole above my head. That hole, which also served as the entry point for the moonlight, looked quite small when I looked up.</p>
<p>But that’s because there is a considerable distance from the ground. The actual size of the hole is significant. It is large enough to allow large monsters to come and go easily.</p>
<p>Entering and exiting would be difficult unless you have the ability to fly.</p>
<p>Looking at it from that point, whoever uses it has the ability to fly and needs a large hole to enter and exit.</p>
<p>In other words—</p>
<p>“…Is it the nest of the lord of flies?”</p>
<p>I murmured weakly. The expectation that I might have been saved faded from my heart.</p>
<p>No, more importantly, if this is the nest of the lord of flies, then the identity of that sound earlier is—</p>
<p>Fearfully, I moved only my head to look. I knew I would regret it if I saw it, but I had no other choice.</p>
<p>And as expected, I regretted it.</p>
<p>“…Hii”</p>
<p>An adventurer was there. Probably one of the missing adventurers Luna Maria talked about. It was a horrifying sight. He had no arms up to his shoulders. Just like his feet and thighs.</p>
<p>Countless larvae were attached to the open wounds where bones and reddish flesh were exposed.</p>
<p>They ranged in size from that of an ant to that of a fist, countless larvae clung to the wounds, gnawing at the bones, devouring the flesh, and sucking the blood.</p>
<p>That wasn’t the only terrifying thing. From that adventurer, several larvae overflowed from his nose, mouth, and ears.</p>
<p>Only the eyes seemed to be spared. Or so I thought. In the next moment…</p>
<p>– Our eyes met.</p>
<p>Fear and desperation floated in the light, yet I was sure that I was still here.</p>
<p>As evidence of that, the adventurer widened his eyes, and it seemed like he was trying to say something—but what came out were not words but countless larvae.</p>
<p>“Hii… Hii…”</p>
<p>What I had read in the records was real. Looking at that horrific sight, I could only think that I would be next. Upon realizing that fact…</p>
<p>“Hyaaaaaaaaa!”</p>
<p>I screamed, unable to bear it. As if in response, the surrounding larvae came all at once.</p>
<p>“Don’t come near me!”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>I moved my head, the only thing I could move, and tried to shoo away the larvae. But they didn’t stop because of that, instead sticking to my limbs in an instant.</p>
<p>My right arm, injured by Miroslav, was easily devoured. The larvae relished where the blood was dripping.</p>
<p>Glancing, my toes had disappeared. They had eaten my left arm down to my wrist.</p>
<p>I could feel the larvae that had entered my body through the wounds gnawing at the bones of my limbs.</p>
<p>Normally, I should be writhing in intense pain. And it wouldn’t be strange to go insane.</p>
<p>But still, I remained sane. There was no pain. On the contrary, every time they devoured my body, a sensation akin to pleasure coursed through me, and my spine trembled.</p>
<p>It was probably a skill of the larvae. Just as mosquitoes suck blood and inject a substance that blocks pain, the larvae must have released something that blocks the sensation of pain while they eat the flesh.</p>
<p>As a result, they are alive in a situation where they should be dying.</p>
<p>It tests the fear of being devoured alive. On instinct, the king of the flies must know that “Prey tastes better when it’s alive.”</p>
<p>Otherwise, this ability would be meaningless. Moreover, I couldn’t explain why they didn’t attempt to eat the parts essential for living, such as the face and torso.</p>
<p>However, no matter how much pain is eliminated, there is a limit to how long one can live while losing so much blood.</p>
<p>When I realized it, the larvae, each the size of beans, were gathering around my face.</p>
<p>A small group of larvae sometimes moved away and then approached again, repeating this several times as if they were playing.</p>
<p>They were much smaller than the other larvae, possibly consisting of newborns.</p>
<p>Are they waiting for me to weaken? Or are they playing with their feeble raw food?</p>
<p>Then I thought.</p>
<p>If all the larvae here become kings of the flies, the Kingdom of Canaria would be destroyed more than the city of Ishka.</p>
<p>Then, the swarm of king flies would attack the Adastela Empire—but, there is no doubt that the users of the Illusory Sword style from the Mitsurugi family, the protector of the Empire, would take care of that.</p>
<p>The fact that the human called Mitsurugi Sora became prey of the king of the flies will never be known, and I will melt into the earth.</p>
<p>And those who will be above the ground, the voices of my father, my brother, and the users of the Illusory Sword style will continue to resonate vividly.</p>
<p>When I thought about that, fear, anger, dissatisfaction, and despair, along with something murky, welled up from the depths of my stomach like a spring of water.</p>
<p>My physical wounds are fatal. Even if I don’t feel pain, the blood loss is definitely lethal.</p>
<p>Even if help were to come, the chances of survival would be zero.</p>
<p>Perhaps if there is a priest among the rescue party who can use “Healing.” Or if an adventurer has a multipurpose potion, it might be possible to survive.</p>
<p>But I would only survive. My lost limbs would never return.</p>
<p>I heard that the pope of the Holy Kingdom in the south can perform a miracle called “Restoration,” but for a lost adventurer like me, it amounts to nothing.</p>
<p>I would never be able to wield a sword again. I would never be able to walk on my own two feet.</p>
<p>I would have to inform my mother, who told me I could be anything I wanted, that I was devoured by larvae.</p>
<p>Ah, how pathetic…</p>
<p>“Ahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”</p>
<p>Unable to bear the despair, I screamed like a madman.</p>
<p>“Stay away! Don’t eat me! I don’t want to die in a place like this! I don’t want to die!”</p>
<p>I wildly moved my head, screamed, and tried to rid myself of the larvae that were still chewing on my body.</p>
<p>However, the paralyzing effect of the king of the flies was incredibly strong, and no matter how much time passed, I could only move my head.</p>
<p>It seems the larvae knew that, so they didn’t react to my voice and continued devouring me.</p>
<p>How much time had passed while I was screaming? I pressed my face against the ground. I screamed with the sensation of the cold earth against my cheek.</p>
<p>“Curse… Why? Why is this happening…?”</p>
<p>Should I have left the adventurer’s path as soon as I was expelled from the adventurers’ guild?</p>
<p>Should I have returned to Ishka following Lars and the others’ advice when we met?</p>
<p>No, in the first place, was it a mistake to become an adventurer five years ago?</p>
<p>When I was expelled from the island, if I had chosen another path… if I had let go of my sword at Ayaka’s advice, I wouldn’t have wasted these five years. I could have continued my life without going through all of this.</p>
<p>…However, it would contradict that oath.</p>
<p>At the moment I was practicing in the dojo, my mother collapsed, and when I ran to see her, she had already passed away.</p>
<p>I swore while looking at her in that state. I will become someone as great as the sky, as my mother wanted. I swore.</p>
<p>A pledge to master the Illusory Sword style, to defeat monsters, to protect people, and to become someone respected by all.</p>
<p>It was a vow to become someone like my father, whom my mother loved.</p>
<p>After being expelled from the island, I chose the path of an adventurer to fulfill this oath.</p>
<p>If I am a nobody, then I can be anything.</p>
<p>That’s why I became an adventurer. I worked hard for five years. To become a man like my father. And also, to visit my mother’s grave someday with my head held high.</p>
<p>But is this the end? To be devoured by larvae? No way. Not like this…</p>
<p>“I haven’t lived all this time for something like this!”</p>
<p>It was a moment when my uncontrollable regret exploded into words.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, the movements of the larvae changed.</p>
<p>While making an unsettling sound, they rushed toward my face, which they had never tried to eat before.</p>
<p>“Guh!? S-Stay back! Enough!”</p>
<p>To my eyes, nose, mouth, ears—I desperately shook my head to keep them away.</p>
<p>However, the larvae kept advancing regardless of my resistance</p>
<p>I could feel them crawling into my ears and nose. Their actions were different from before.</p>
<p>Surely, they had decided that I could no longer survive.</p>
<p>Now was when I would taste the most delicious. Let’s devour him as we please—those seemed to be their intentions.</p>
<p>Finally, they seemed to want to enter my mouth, but I desperately closed my lips.</p>
<p>They also approached my eyes, but I squeezed my eyelids shut.</p>
<p>However, they ate my lips. They ate my eyelids.</p>
<p>“———————–! —————! Huh!”</p>

<p>I let out a voice that was not a voice.</p>
<p>Did I want to scream in anger? Did I want to ask for help? Or perhaps, did I want to beg for forgiveness?</p>
<p>I kept screaming without knowing.</p>
<p>I knew that no one would answer, but I kept screaming.</p>
<p>–At that moment, I heard a voice. A response that shouldn’t be there, I heard it.</p>
