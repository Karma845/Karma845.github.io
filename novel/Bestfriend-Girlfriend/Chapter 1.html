<h1>Chapter 1: Saki Shiratori is Expecting</h1><h3>The Value of a Smile</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230; Fuーmin, I love you&#8230; I love you so much…”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:Mai uses A–shi to address herself]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After parting our lips, Fujiwara-san gazes at me with affectionate eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It happened on our way back from school, in a narrow alley close to her mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since officially becoming a couple, I&#8217;ve been walking her home after school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Partly because she wished for it, but there&#8217;s also another reason now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The truth is, Anna Teruya suddenly disappeared from the detention centre where she was being held.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to the extraordinary events, Ryoko seems to believe that I must have been the one who kidnapped her, but I swear I haven&#8217;t done anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering the possibility that Anna Teruya, who escaped, might target someone, Fujiwara-san is the first person that comes to mind. It&#8217;s best to stay cautious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, Fuーmin, do you like me? Do you love me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Say it properly, that you love me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I love you, Mai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though we may seem like an incredibly foolish couple, let&#8217;s try to act like lovers. Let&#8217;s follow the normal steps of a relationship. After all, I can&#8217;t be indifferent now that I&#8217;ve said that.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;Well, it&#8217;s not like I dislike it, though.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the dimly lit alley during the twilight, we embrace each other and passionately kiss repeatedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Our tongues entwine, and as we savour each other&#8217;s saliva, I feel strength in the hands that hold her body, and a sensation of blood rushing to my groin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But then, I forcefully suppress the almost uncontrollable desire and burn with impatience, as if longing to take that final step.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The excitement when embracing my favourite princesses is different from the excitement of love.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it&#8217;s part of the process of falling in love. Right now, I&#8217;m enjoying it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it&#8217;s about time&#8230; Shall we go?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh! I don&#8217;t want to go home yet! I want to keep cuddling with you…”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ve been together all day since this morning.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, Fujiwara-san sticks to me even during classes. At first, the teachers paid attention to it, but recently they&#8217;ve started turning a blind eye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Muu&#8230; Fuーmin, don&#8217;t you want to cuddle with me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, of course, saying I don&#8217;t want to would be a lie.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boo, you&#8217;re not being straightforward. Ah, I wish we could get married soon, Fuーmin. Then we could be together every second…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I laugh it off. In her mind, it seems like getting married to me is already a settled matter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also laughed it off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the next day, on Saturday morning, my parents approached me with serious expressions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We want you to go to Mai&#8217;s house today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh!? Why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s an order from the president.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">According to my father, he was summoned to the president&#8217;s office yesterday and received instructions to send me to the Fujiwara family&#8217;s house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was pressure from a business partner company. If not, they threatened to suspend all business transactions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shiratori&#8230;Can&#8217;t you be a bit more sociable?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s the benefit of being sociable?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way back from visiting grandma&#8217;s house.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For me—Natsumi Shima, my grandmother and for Shiratori, her great-grandmother, they were asked to bring Shiratori along, but she had no interest in showing her face, so she reluctantly dragged her there.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Shima,address herself as Uchi* not the house which also called uchi]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Shiratori remained unchanged even when dealing with her grandma. Without showing any smile, she repeatedly responded with a nonchalant [whatever]. Her attitude was so unfriendly it was almost rude.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, grandma seemed satisfied just by seeing her face, so it&#8217;s fine&#8230; Besides, compared to when she first came here, she has become a bit more human.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While thinking about such things, as we walked along the long hedge in front of the grand mansion, we noticed a suspicious figure lurking in the shadow of a utility pole, gazing towards the mansion&#8217;s gate.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Unfortunately, that suspicious figure turned out to be someone we knew.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing here, Kijima?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pyah!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There stood Kijima Fumio.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite his unremarkable appearance, he was a notorious villain who kidnapped and enslaved numerous women—the very King of Confinement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When addressed from behind, he jumped like a character from an American cartoon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What&#8230; Shima-san? Don&#8217;t startle me like that.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;Even though he&#8217;s a villain, he&#8217;s too much of a scaredy-cat.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you doing? Stalking someone?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t say it like that! It sounds bad!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What&#8217;s he talking about? He did so much worse than stalking.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but give Kijima a disapproving look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you&#8217;re not stalking, then why are you acting all sneaky?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230; Actually…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The content of Kijima&#8217;s story was so unexpected that I was taken aback.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, they took your parents&#8217; company hostage to call you? Seriously, you&#8217;re something else. No wonder you&#8217;re related to the Fujiwara Group. What on earth did you do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t know&#8230;Maybe I&#8217;m being pressured to marry Fujiwara-san or they&#8217;re forcing us to break up. It&#8217;s probably one of those two.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I contemplated the situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As someone who supports Hatsu-chan, part of me feels like it would be better if they broke up now. But if it turns out they have to get married, Hatsu-chan might regress into her child-like self and start crying again. I really don&#8217;t want that to happen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I whispered to Kijima.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If things get serious, you might end up kidnapping her parents.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Well, that&#8217;s the worst-case scenario. But if I do that, there&#8217;s a high chance everything I&#8217;ve built with Fujiwara-san will be ruined…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa&#8230;Hey, Shiratori. Can&#8217;t we do something about this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before I answer that, is this Fujiwara-san, the same person as Mai Fujiwara? His girlfriend?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah, that&#8217;s right. Why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shiratori started observing Kijima with a suspicious look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Kijima tugged at the hem of my T-shirt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, Shima-san, who is this person?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Haven&#8217;t you met before? Shiratori, she&#8217;s a second-year from the track and field team.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon hearing that, Kijima seemed to recall something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, right&#8230; I see.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, there&#8217;s no need to explicitly mention that she&#8217;s my niece. It&#8217;s too troublesome to explain.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Shiratori turned her face towards me and gave a slight nod.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Alright. I&#8217;ll go with him.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really!? Thank you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, wait, Shima-san! I can&#8217;t see what&#8217;s going on at all!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I waved my hand at the bewildered Kijima and decided to go home alone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It turned into quite an odd situation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To visit my girlfriend&#8217;s house, I was accompanied by a girl I had just met. Moreover, she was incredibly unfriendly.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Shima-san, what are you thinking…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aren&#8217;t you going? Come on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, yeah.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Prompted by Shiratori, I walked up to the gate and rang the doorbell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, a man in his thirties, wearing a suit, came out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you Kijima-sama? The master is waiting for you. And who is this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;she&#8217;s my companion.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see. Please come this way then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Guided by the man, we stepped into the mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were led to a spacious Japanese-style room with a view of a Japanese garden.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The overly formal atmosphere made me feel nervous.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, even stealing a glance, Shiratori&#8217;s expression showed no change.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, a middle-aged couple, probably in their late fifties, who seemed to be Fujiwara-san&#8217;s parents, entered the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The father was probably in his late fifties, with his hair smoothly pulled back and wearing traditional Japanese clothing. He was slender but had sharp eyes and an imposing presence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mother appeared to be in her late thirties. Her facial features closely resembled Fujiwara-san&#8217;s. Her hair was cut at shoulder length, also dressed in traditional Japanese attire, and wearing a light green kimono with attached sleeves.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sitting across the low table from us, the father looked at me and spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Mai might have some questionable taste.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Honey, you&#8217;re being rude.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it&#8217;s an undeniable fact, so I don&#8217;t really mind, but the mother apologised with a somewhat apologetic gesture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; Nice to meet you. I am Mai Fujiwara&#8217;s mother.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Th-thank you very much. I-I’m Kijima, and this is my friend Shiratori, who came along as my companion today.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I mentioned [friend] Shiratori gave me a piercing glare.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, I can&#8217;t just say she&#8217;s an acquaintance, it wouldn&#8217;t be believable.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;where is Mai?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hesitantly, I asked, and the father responded in a dismissive tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m the one who called you here today. Mai has nothing to do with it. She&#8217;s out on a mission as my assistant.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt a little relieved that Fujiwara-san wasn&#8217;t involved.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really wouldn&#8217;t want someone who takes their own parent&#8217;s company hostage like that as my girlfriend.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But let&#8217;s get to the point…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that preface, the father took out a paper from his pocket and slid it towards me on the low table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Let&#8217;s have you sign this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I took it in my hand, I couldn&#8217;t help but freeze in shock.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To anyone, it was undoubtedly a marriage registration form.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-Signing this&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring my confusion, the father started speaking eloquently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ll prepare a new house within the estate, but for now, it&#8217;s better for you to live together in Mai&#8217;s room. You can continue your university studies if you want, but after graduation, you will undergo training in one of our group companies as a candidate for my successor.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-Wait a minute!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you have any objections?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Before talking about objections, isn&#8217;t this conversation going way too fast!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When you were in trouble, manipulated by that girl Fukuda, I provided support from behind the scenes. Even when you were detained by the police. And in exchange for helping you, I gave conditions to Mai: to marry you and consider you as one of my potential successors.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Without my consent!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s unnecessary. Such a thing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Frankly, his remarks angered me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He was underestimating me, thinking I would just comply with whatever he said.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I decline. I am dating Mai-san, not because I want to become your son!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He looked surprisingly taken aback by my response.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To marry a beautiful girl and ride the coattails of wealth, yet you say such absurd things. Well, fine then.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was surprised by how easily he backed down.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in the next moment, he twisted his mouth with an unpleasant grin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, how about you repay the money spent to save you? Specifically, it&#8217;s around four billion.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you refuse our offer and can&#8217;t return the money, be prepared for the appropriate consequences.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This cunning old man..Using money like a weapon to hit people&#8217;s faces!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought about it. It&#8217;s not like I don&#8217;t have means to make money.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili told me that selling gems from the Demon World is prohibited as it could cause chaos in the market, but if it becomes necessary, there may be no other choice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing me remain silent, Fujiwara-san&#8217;s father spoke with a triumphant look on his face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t take it the wrong way. It&#8217;s just a little whim of a doting father for his beloved daughter, Kijima-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in the next moment, Shiratori, who had been silent until now, said with her usual stern expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, it&#8217;s just a payment of four billion, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I instinctively raised my head. Fujiwara-san&#8217;s father tilted his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you pay that? You?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t pay a single bit. I&#8217;ll only tell him how to get the money.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230; what are you planning to do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll make appointments starting from the top of the list of rich people and ask them to lend him the money.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but be amazed. There&#8217;s no way anyone would lend such a huge amount of money to a student like me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But Shiratori&#8217;s tone remained unwavering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t it easier to charm one wealthy person with smooth words to earn four billion, rather than trying to make that much money?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her words divided, she audaciously pointed her finger at Fujiwara-san&#8217;s father.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And you can&#8217;t deny this method, can you? Absolutely not.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A heavy silence fell.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I held my breath, waiting for my father&#8217;s reaction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He must be getting angry. That&#8217;s what I imagined, but contrary to my expectations, Fujiwara-san&#8217;s father burst into laughter with a wide open mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahahaha! How amusing! You&#8217;re an interesting kid! How about joining us in the future?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I decline. If I were to sell myself, I would choose a buyer who would pay a high price.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, Shiratori glanced briefly in my direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is it him?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, who knows?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm, interesting! Very interesting indeed!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With those words, Fujiwara-san&#8217;s father laughed loudly and left the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, just the two of us, Fujiwara-san&#8217;s mother and I exchanged glances and tilted our heads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;what was that all about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m not sure, but it&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve seen him so happy like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without understanding what was going on, we left the mansion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230;Shiratori-san, could you explain a bit? What exactly was that all about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Walking ahead of me, she replied without looking back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;The method to make that ridiculous amount of money&#8230; It&#8217;s actually something Fujiwara-san’s father, Masataka Fujiwara, did when he was told by the previous head of the family to come up with five billion yen as a challenge.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Since he actually achieved results with that method, he can&#8217;t deny it…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wonder how she knows about all this, but honestly, I&#8217;m grateful that she helped me out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How should I say this&#8230;..Thank you.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you want to express your gratitude, then return it in a tangible form. I&#8217;ve decided that if I&#8217;m going to sell myself, I&#8217;ll sell to the highest bidder. Like I said earlier, King of Confinement.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but widen my eyes. </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Y-you knew?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How many times do you think I heard that while being the cherished princess, Fujiwara Mai-sama, during my captivity? If she has a boyfriend, the King of Confinement, it could only be you, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha&#8230; I&#8217;m at your mercy, I guess.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If I don&#8217;t obey, I&#8217;ll be kidnapped. In a sense, I&#8217;m like a pet on a leash right now. In that case, I might as well push my master to the heights of my desires. I think it&#8217;s a constructive way to look at it, don&#8217;t you think?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230; I don&#8217;t fully understand, but&#8230;does that mean you&#8217;ll continue to support me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Depending on how you look at it&#8230; yes.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She answered without even looking back. She really lacks manners.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In that case&#8230; I&#8217;d appreciate it if you could show a little more warmth towards me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment, she turned around to face me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, her expression remained stern as ever.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My smile doesn&#8217;t come cheap, you know. If you want to see it, you&#8217;ll need to provide appropriate compensation for it.”</span></p>



<h3>Black Swan EP</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Opening the sliding door with a rattling sound, I discarded my loafers and entered. From the living room, Natsumi&#8217;s face peeked out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome back. How did your match go, Shiratori?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was nothing special.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing special, huh&#8230;haa, you&#8217;re so unsociable.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as she let out an exaggerated sigh, another woman&#8217;s voice could be heard from the depths of the living room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Natsumi! Your tiles are ready! Stop dawdling. How long are these half-rounds going to take?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know, I know. Nee-chan, you don&#8217;t have to keep nagging like that.”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p>As I briefly glanced into the living room while passing by, I saw my grandmother, Natsumi, her three years older sister, <span style="font-weight: 400">Kaori</span>, and her four years older brother, Natsuki, engrossed in a game of mahjong.</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon entering high school, I left my family&#8217;s home in Tokyo and stayed in the Natsumi family&#8217;s house, which is my mother&#8217;s side of the family.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mother, Kana, is the eldest of seven siblings. Natsumi is the youngest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to that, even though we&#8217;re only a year apart, Natsumi and I have an aunt and niece relationship.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What a noisy household…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although there are seven siblings in total, currently only five of us remain in this house, along with our grandfather who is over seventy and still works as a master carpenter on construction sites. However, the other siblings frequently come back with their families, so this house is always bustling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ron!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwa,Kaa-chan! Don&#8217;t scare me like that!”</span></p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-53398443' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-53398443' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t act like you didn&#8217;t know.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, Natsumi, you&#8217;re in charge of dinner duty.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaa&#8230;well, whatever. Hey! Shiratori, you help too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way, you lost Oba-san, not me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t call me Oba-san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I heard Natsumi&#8217;s exclamation from behind, I climbed the stairs and returned to my room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This was once a six-tatami room that my mother, second and third aunt used to share. The three-tier bunk bed handmade by my grandfather exudes an atmosphere reminiscent of a forced internment camp seen in movies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after five o&#8217;clock, the summer sun remained high, and the closed room was stifling and humid. Sweat gently trickled down my forehead. I opened the window to let in some fresh air and turned on the air conditioning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I dislike the heat. The sensation of my thoughts slowing down is just unpleasant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From downstairs, the lively voices still echoed. It seemed like Natsumi and Natsuki were in disagreement about the dinner menu.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, this was nothing out of the ordinary. It&#8217;s not like they don&#8217;t get along. They&#8217;re just playfully arguing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the first place, the people in this house have a strange sense of personal space. They just won&#8217;t leave you alone. The reason I&#8217;m even a member of the track and field club is that Natsumi forced me into it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While recently I&#8217;ve come to accept it as 『just how things are』 when I was first placed here, I was quite bewildered by this lack of consideration for personal space.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pull the chair of the PC desk with the three-screen monitor and quietly take a seat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“King of Confinement&#8230;huh.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, I recalled the boy I had just met today.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To think I could encounter something so interesting in a place like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first glance, he&#8217;s just an ordinary, unremarkable boy. Average. But he&#8217;s too average.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I know how immense his power is. Perhaps only a very small number of people know that too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yet, from what I observed today, despite possessing such tremendous power, there&#8217;s no sign of him getting lost in it. Occasionally, there were faint traces of confidence in his words, but that was it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He&#8217;s too average. That&#8217;s what&#8217;s abnormal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even today, I didn&#8217;t really need to intervene.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But observing beside him, it became clear. The option of using his power to crush others doesn&#8217;t even exist in his mind. Despite being frustrated by his father in law&#8217;s words.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Truly intriguing.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to put a name to this feeling born within me, it would be 『anticipation』.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Although I&#8217;m not yet entirely sure what&#8217;s different…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I recalled the incident that led to me being placed in the Natsumi family&#8217;s care.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Counting the differences between the men who were there and the Confinement King.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The heavy winter rain was battering against the windows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The torrential rain noise covered the world like static on a radio and outside the window was a dark schoolyard with the sun fully set.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under the distant streetlights, rain was tracing silver lines like piano wires.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Breaths turned white in the cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I sat on the lectern, wearing a duffle coat over my uniform. Swinging my legs idly, I glanced around the classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A girl&#8217;s sobbing and the beastly sounds of a boy&#8217;s heavy breathing. Buttons torn off blouses, skirts pushed up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amidst the dishevelled desks and chairs, on the hard floor, three pairs of boys and girls were entangled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sa, Saki-chan&#8230;he-help me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girl looked at me with pleading eyes.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What&#8217;s her name again?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thought about that, I gazed absentmindedly at the girl.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I hate this! Nooo!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why! Why would you do something like this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other two girls resisted the boy pressing down on them and shouted through tearful voices.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Why? Why would she say something so strange?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unwanted tales of love I had been told over and over again. Even though these three girls had gone out of their way to give each of these boys they claimed to like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">These three were what you&#8217;d call honour students. Even if it was at the behest of a teacher, they always paid attention to me, the loner in the class. Whether I appreciated it or not was another matter, but their intentions were undoubtedly good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, I responded in kind with goodwill.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how many times I simulated it, the possibility of those girls being able to date the boys they liked was nonexistent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I consider the idea that their love will come true and that they will reach the culmination of that love, this method was the simplest and most efficient.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I think about the purpose of the state of love, it goes without saying where it leads.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Whether one can leave descendants after one or two attempts is unknown, though…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For the boys, it was simple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Exaggerate small mistakes, confine them with guilt and fear, narrow their perspective. By providing escape routes and excuses, guiding them and linking their sexual desire, they easily overcome ethics and morals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Noooooo!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girls&#8217; screams were drowned out by the sound of the rain, unable to reach anywhere.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, that&#8217;s precisely why such a rainy day was chosen for this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230; stop&#8230; forgive me&#8230;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the commotion lasted only until penetration was achieved. Now, the only sounds echoing were the sobbing voices and the shaky knees of the boys who rocked their hips, along with faint suppressed moans.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This area was quite different from manga and novels. They should be making more pleasurable sounds, but the difference between fiction and reality in this aspect could be seen as a new insight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While pondering about the expressions in fiction and the benefits for the audience that arise from them, a series of desperate moans from the boys rang out, causing a momentary [Uuuu!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiii!? Nooo! Don&#8217;t ejaculate! I don&#8217;t want it inside!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s almost over now&#8230; Choosing a rainy day was a good idea, but&#8230;the way back will be tough. The rain won&#8217;t conveniently stop, will it?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I absentmindedly listened to the girls&#8217; tearful voices and thought about such matters, the classroom door suddenly swung open, and the flashlight&#8217;s beam pierced my  retina.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What are you all doing!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Entering was the physical education teacher. It’s name was forgotten.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Trouble…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was an unexpected development. Normally, there shouldn&#8217;t have been anyone left in the school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Later, I heard that the teacher had forgotten something and returned to school after briefly going home. At that time, I hadn&#8217;t yet considered the possibility of such an unplanned event.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a failure. Naturally, it became a matter for the police.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I haven&#8217;t heard what happened to the three boys. I&#8217;m not interested. It&#8217;s unlikely that they would snitch on me. They don&#8217;t believe I did anything to them.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason I managed to be there without being attacked by the boys was simply due to the numbers. Most of the time, they would just accept it after seeing how menacing my gaze was. Being in that situation without seeking help was because I was paralyzed by fear. That&#8217;s just how it turned out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The girls&#8217; comments about me were dismissed as jealous and negative emotions directed at the one who hadn&#8217;t been violated. There&#8217;s no way I could explain to them what I did.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the way home, my mother, who had come to the police station to pick me up and asked me this,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Saki, it was your doing wasn&#8217;t it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That’s right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What were you thinking?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nothing in particular. I just fulfilled those girls&#8217; desires. Don&#8217;t worry. I&#8217;ll do it better next time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I couldn&#8217;t quite understand my mother&#8217;s expression at that moment. Her emotions were all mixed up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And after thinking for a while, she said this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Saki&#8230; I&#8217;m going to send you to grandma’s.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I tried to contemplate once again about the Confinement King, Natsumi shouted loudly from downstairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O—Iii, Shiratori! I&#8217;m heading out to buy dinner groceries, so come with me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be like that! We&#8217;re out of rice. I can&#8217;t handle it on my own, can I? It’s two 10-kilo bags. Come on, let&#8217;s go!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a deep sigh and stood up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I leave her be, Natsumi will probably barge into the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The people in this house have an odd sense of personal space.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, yeah, I get it, Oba-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t call me Oba-san! You idiot!”</span></p>
<p>&#8212;<br />
That&#8217;s quite dark past..</p>
