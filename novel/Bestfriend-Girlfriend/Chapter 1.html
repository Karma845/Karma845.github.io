<h2>Chapter 1: Happy, But Certainly Not The End</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>“Arisaka and I are dating. Yorka is my girlfriend.”</p>



<p>A lot had happened in our high school life since I boldly declared our relationship in front of our classmates. After all, my beloved girlfriend was none other than <em>the</em> Arisaka Yorka, the school’s most sought-after beauty who consistently garnered attention. As for me, Sena Kisumi, I was the epitome of an unremarkable high school boy. Voices echoing,<em> “How did such an incongruous couple come to be?” </em>filled the halls of Eisei High School.</p>



<p><em>But that’s none of their business.</em></p>



<p>‘Love’, it seemed, remained the paramount concern in any social group. Though observers might question our compatibility, Yorka and I shared a genuine affection. The flawlessly perfect beauty harbored unexpected insecurities, and it was in <em>me</em> that she found the one to open her heart. We traversed the journey of our relationship, at times laughing, at times navigating through moments of jealousy, but always at our own pace.</p>



<p>Our passionate love endured the passage of time, continuing unwaveringly even after high school graduation. We enrolled in the same university, eventually cohabiting during our studies, and spent our fulfilling four years together. In our second year as working professionals, I proposed to her. But this time, Yorka didn’t run away like she did after my confession under the cherry blossom tree behind the school building, she responded with a resounding “YES” without hesitation.</p>



<p>Soon after, our tranquil married life was blessed with children, and we lived happily as a family.</p>



<p>The end, a story without regrets in my life. Ah, what a splendid happily-ever-after.</p>



<p>──However, this narrative was nothing more than my premature daydream.</p>



<p>Beyond the first words, it was a complete escape from my reality.</p>



<p>Of course, it was undeniable that I, now a second-year high school student happily in a relationship with Arisaka Yorka, was living a happy life.</p>



<p>While I was eagerly anticipating the next step toward this ideal future, I contemplated planning a weekend date with her. Yet, even for a love-struck couple like us, the realization of a weekend date was not always possible.</p>



<p>“What on earth are you thinking, you idiot!”</p>



<p>“Sena-san! Do you have any idea how much I struggled to smooth things over for you two?”</p>



<p>After the declaration of our relationship that afternoon, I found myself in the student guidance office. Arisaka Yorka and our homeroom teacher, Kanzaki Shizuru, were both fervently lecturing me.</p>



<p>A three-way discussion with my girlfriend and teacher present, what a surreal situation. I was being relentlessly blamed from both sides.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kisumi, are you even listening?”</p>



<p>My beloved Yorka spoke with an unusual intensity. Despite her slender figure, she possessed an outstandingly well-proportioned physique. Long limbs, a surprisingly slender waist, and a bust and hips that defied their size – all of it accentuated by her snow-white skin, blushing either with embarrassment or anger.</p>



<p>Her long, elegantly arranged hair shone like polished silk, and her large eyes, clear as a mirror, gazed at me alone, thickly framed by long eyelashes that cast shadows on her cheeks. The charming tear mole near her left eye added to her allure, and her delicate pink lips were utterly captivating.</p>



<p>“I’m listening. I’m just captivated by my beautiful girlfriend,” I said casually, even in the face of her anger. Her well-defined features and the range of expressions she displayed were enchanting.</p>



<p>Not only aesthetically pleasing, but each expression of joy, anger, sorrow, and laughter on Yorka’s face was endearing. I could gaze at her face forever. Even her sharp gaze felt like a pleasant massage, I was enamored. At least, it quickly became apparent that her current anger was a flip side of embarrassment.</p>



<p>“I-I am seriously giving you a warning!” Yorka, easily flustered by my straightforward remark, displayed a cute and innocent reaction.</p>



<p>If only this wasn’t the student guidance office, I would have enjoyed teasing her even more.</p>



<p>“I’m answering honestly because I feel the same way seriously.”</p>



<p>“That’s not what I’m talking about!”</p>



<p>“You don’t seem entirely opposed to it.”</p>



<p>I stared into her eyes, causing her to shy away again with embarrassment.</p>



<p>“Don’t tease me too much, Kisumi. You’re getting a bit too carried away.”</p>



<p>“…Well, I guess I am.”</p>



<p>Yorka’s remark made me realize just how excited I had become.</p>



<p>“Haven’t you noticed? How over-the-top you’re being?”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s definitely something to celebrate. It’s out in the open now that we are officially a couple. While keeping it a secret would’ve been fine, being able to say that Arisaka Yorka is my girlfriend just feels genuinely satisfying.”</p>



<p>Yorka accepted my confession this April, and that marked the beginning of our relationship. Initially, we kept it a secret per her wish, as she disliked drawing attention. However, our secret didn’t last long; someone witnessed us parting ways at the station one holiday morning.</p>



<p>Rumors of Arisaka Yorka spending the night with a guy quickly spread throughout the school. Unable to bear the unprecedented attention, she impulsively decided to break up. With the help of reliable friends, we managed to reconcile and resume our relationship as a couple.</p>



<p>I never wanted to experience that kind of loss again. That’s why I made the decision to declare our relationship openly.</p>



<p>“…I appreciate that you’re happy, Kisumi. I get it completely. But still, embarrassing things are embarrassing! I’m fine just quietly dating as we have been.”</p>



<p>Was it a divine intervention or did DNA unleash its full potential? Arisaka Yorka, a peerless beauty, was simply attention-grabbing. The constant scrutiny around her had been nothing but stress since childhood. Thanks to that, she became quite misanthropic.</p>



<p>Yorka who was sensitive to gazes would hide in the art preparation room in a corner of the school building during breaks, avoiding interactions as much as possible. In the classroom, she kept her cool beauty aura, thoroughly keeping classmates at a distance.</p>



<p>I only learned about the school’s top beauty being socially awkward when I started visiting the art preparation room last summer.</p>



<p>“Don’t take it too seriously. We have nothing to feel guilty about. If we declare it, we can openly flirt in the classroom, right?”</p>



<p>“W-well, I think being too forward is not a good idea. If we get too touchy in the dark, we might get tired of each other quickly…”</p>



<p>“I won’t get tired of Yorka, that’s for sure!”</p>



<p>“Oh, th-thanks. But that’s not the point!”</p>



<p>Yorka seemed to be desperately holding back a smile at my straightforward response.</p>



<p>“Fine, I get it. I’ll hold back in the classroom. But in private, there won’t be any holding back!”</p>



<p>“That’s not the issue here!”</p>



<p>“So, you prefer if I act indifferent? It feels a bit lonely.”</p>



<p>“W-Well, that’s, um…” Yorka had a somewhat conflicted expression, seeming to dislike public displays of affection but also finding the idea not entirely unfavorable.</p>



<p>“Fighting while flirting—it’s quite the skill. Especially in front of a teacher,” Kanzaki-sensei expressed her disapproval with a deadpan, icy tone.</p>



<p>“Oh, you noticed?”</p>



<p>“It’s not what you think!”</p>



<p>“Please consider the feelings of someone forced to witness your lovers’ quarrel.” Kanzaki-sensei placed a finger to her forehead as if holding back a headache. Yorka seemed irritated by the reaction from her arch-nemesis.</p>



<p>“Deciding to go public with your relationship is a personal matter. I won’t comment on that. However! There is such a thing as an appropriate timing for everything! What’s the meaning behind declaring your relationship right after discreetly dealing with the rumor? Couldn’t you at least consider my efforts a little?”</p>



<p>For someone usually reserved like Kanzaki-sensei, it was unusual for her to speak so much. With silky black hair and an impressive, graceful demeanor, she exuded an elegant charm. Even sitting in a chair, she had a picturesque quality about her. The mature, sophisticated Kanzaki-sensei fixed a stern gaze on me.</p>



<p>The unsung hero who worked behind the scenes to quash the morning rumors was clearly dissatisfied.</p>



<p>In today’s homeroom, right after I declared our relationship, while classmates teased and congratulated, the teacher maintained a stoic silence. It seemed like the emotions she had suppressed then were erupting now.</p>



<p>“But, Sensei, you did ask me to be Yorka’s bridge.”</p>



<p>“Sena-san, what I requested was for you to facilitate connections between Arisaka-san, who struggles with social interactions, with other students. It’s merely being a communication liaison, supporting her overall school life. I didn’t ask you to take advantage of your role as a class representative and get romantically involved.”</p>



<p>Our cupid of a teacher was being quite direct.</p>



<p>Of course, I was well aware that the teacher didn’t particularly fancy my approach. Still, my declaration had to happen at that exact moment.</p>



<p>“It just happened that I was class rep!”</p>



<p>Utilizing my role as a class rep, I approached Yorka, it might be seen as a bit scheming depending on your perspective. But wasn’t the start of any romance a bit like that? Initially, you might not have any such intentions, but over time, special feelings naturally developed.</p>



<p>“…Sena-san, you’re surprisingly quick to attack.” The teacher stared at me suspiciously with obsidian-like eyes.</p>



<p>“That’s not true at all. It took over half a year to confess. If I had such amazing romance skills, we’d have been together since our freshman year. Heck, I would have had a girlfriend ages ago.”</p>



<p>“Is that so?” Kanzaki-sensei remained skeptically doubtful.</p>



<p>“Ki-su-mi ~ Did you ever had a chance with another girl way back then?”</p>



<p>Yorka’s voice echoed from the depths of hell. <em>Don’t join forces with your arch-nemesis only in times like these!</em></p>



<p>“It’s just an analogy! I’ve been and will always be devoted to Yorka!”</p>



<p>“Stop flirting like that,” the teacher sighed in exasperation.</p>



<p>“Sensei! We genuinely like each other. It’s pure love. A serious relationship.”</p>



<p>“I didn’t ask for a press conference,” Kanzaki-sensei continued her lecture in her usual calm and composed tone.</p>



<p>“This is about me and Kisumi, not something for outsiders to comment on!” Yorka wasn’t staying silent either.</p>



<p>“I’m your homeroom teacher. It’s my duty to guide students appropriately and ensure they don’t face unnecessary disadvantages due to reckless actions.”</p>



<p>“That’s meddling! We just made our relationship public. Is it necessary to drag us to the student guidance room over something so trivial?”</p>



<p>Yorka jumped to my defense. She’s surprisingly intense when it came to dealing with Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-san, you’re quite overprotective, aren’t you? I only called Sena-san here.”</p>



<p>“Is my presence causing a problem?”</p>



<p>“To be frank, more than I anticipated. I can’t have an important conversation with Sena-san.”</p>



<p>Even Yorka was left speechless by such a straightforward statement.</p>



<p>“Both of you, calm down. I simply announced our relationship while thinking about the future.”</p>



<p>“”Whose fault is this?”” they both snapped.</p>



<p>Getting scolded by both a beauty and a cutie simultaneously wasn’t exactly my ideal situation.</p>



<p>“Both of you are in sync. Look, positive changes are already happening.”</p>



<p>I didn’t impulsively announce our relationship. As long as I was with Yorka, that’s all that matters. Even if we kept it a secret until graduation, our feelings wouldn’t cool off. I just thought making our relationship public would make our high school life even more enjoyable.</p>



<p>“Ugh, what a day! This morning, Kisumi proudly declared, <em>‘Yorka is my girlfriend,’</em> and it spread throughout the school. Everyone’s staring at me in the hallways, and I’ll have to endure the teacher’s scolding after school,” Yorka complained, pouting her lips.</p>



<p>Why did Yorka have such a strong aversion to Kanzaki-sensei?</p>



<p>I’d argue Kanzaki-sensei was the best mentor around—elegant, kind, the epitome of a woman. She’s wise and always composed. If a troubled student sought advice, she offered precise guidance.</p>



<p>Yorka’s older sister, an alumna of Eisei High and a former student of Kanzaki-sensei, maintained a lasting connection with her. Thanks to this bond, the rumor was successfully quelled.</p>



<p>Despite being sisters, it seemed liking the same teacher wasn’t a given.</p>



<p>“Isn’t it you, Arisaka-san, who tagged along without permission?” Kanzaki-sensei mumbled quietly.</p>



<p>I apologized before Yorka could launch another verbal assault.</p>



<p>“It was wrong not to consult beforehand! But you know Yorka would’ve said no, right?”</p>



<p>“Of course.”</p>



<p>“Well, then I guess a surprise announcement is the only way.”</p>



<p>“What kind of reasoning is that?” Yorka turned away.</p>



<p>“Look at the class’s reaction. Everyone already sensed it. Escaping together during the sports festival’s event planning, cheering for me during the basketball match, helping me to the infirmary when I twisted my ankle. And to top it off, the morning rumor. If we let it linger, it might resurface more overtly later. Besides, Yorka, can you continue restraining your feelings and act composed?” I calmly explained the necessity of declaring our relationship.</p>



<p>The conditions for it to be revealed were already met, and there was a limit to how much we could conceal it. Yorka, with her star-like charisma, naturally drew attention with every move. To cope with the situation, she had become thoroughly indifferent to her surroundings, reducing her stress. Yet, I emerged as an exception in her otherwise isolated daily life.</p>



<p>Though she was normally composed, she became emotional and bold only when I was involved. In essence, her romantic feelings were glaringly obvious to others.</p>



<p>“…Probably impossible,” she reluctantly admitted, showing signs of self-awareness.</p>



<p>It was better to announce it now than to halfheartedly hide it and became a subject of whispers. She seemed to be acknowledging this fact begrudgingly.</p>



<p>“Right? Besides, you can communicate with others better than you think. There’s no need to be overly anxious. I’ll always have your back.”</p>



<p>I knew it was a rough remedy. However, with the first step, you got used to it, and I was here to protect Yorka with all my might.</p>



<p>“Yeah…”</p>



<p>“And we shouldn’t let the teacher’s efforts go to waste.”</p>



<p>“Am I just an extra?”</p>



<p>There’s still a hint of resentment in Kanzaki-sensei’s words.</p>



<p>“Ugh, be more indifferent,” Yorka grumbled resentfully.</p>



<p>“Your concerns are quite luxurious. Arisaka-san’s stress doesn’t solely stem from appearance issues.”</p>



<p>“Yorka has various complicated aspects to her personality, but I like her just the way she is,” I responded, exchanging objective opinions with Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>“You can’t just say whatever you want! I’m leaving!” Yorka slung her bag over her shoulder.</p>



<p>“Huh? No date today?”</p>



<p>“Nope!”</p>



<p>“I wanted to discuss our plans for a holiday date!”</p>



<p>“H-Holiday date?”</p>



<p>My comment made Yorka abruptly stop in her tracks. She was clearly intrigued, which was a good sign.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-san, you’re surprisingly sweet to Sena-san.”</p>



<p>“R-Reflect on your actions for just one day! Go home alone! And no texting today!”</p>



<p><em>There she goes again, blurting out impulsively. </em>After reacting reflexively to the teacher’s words, Yorka walked away, cutting off the temptation.</p>



<p>“…I can endure a day,” I accepted it calmly.</p>



<p>It was late April, almost Golden Week. I wanted to plan a date where Yorka could fully enjoy herself.</p>



<p>──Little did I know, at this moment, I had no clue about the unexpected twists and turns before the holiday date could come true.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>





<p>With Yorka gone, I faced Kanzaki-sensei one-on-one.</p>



<p>“Even after all that fuss from Arisaka-san, she seems ready to forgive you quickly.”</p>



<p>“She’s always like that when we’re alone.”</p>



<p>“Just seeing you two flirting in front of me is already too much. What’s up with Arisaka-san’s behavior? Sena-san, are you really not used to romantic relationships?”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei was still skeptical.</p>



<p>“If I were experienced in love, I wouldn’t let myself be tossed around like that by my girlfriend.”</p>



<p>“No matter how experienced a man is, anyone would find it challenging dealing with Arisaka-san.” Kanzaki-sensei asserted and continued. “Having romantic experience and genuinely caring for someone are two different things. Arisaka-san chose you because she felt your feelings were trustworthy.”</p>



<p>A wise statement. Those were words of an adult woman. I wonder, has Kanzaki-sensei gone through many love experiences?</p>



<p>“…Anyway, Sensei understands, right?”</p>



<p>“Observing Arisaka-san’s reactions, I don’t think your decision this time was hasty. I agree with that.”</p>



<p>“Then—”</p>



<p>“However! Personally, I’m not satisfied. Really! Such audacity!”</p>



<p>Correction. Her mood hadn’t improved at all. I was the class representative under Kanzaki-sensei last year too, but this was the first time I had seen her reveal so much emotion.</p>



<p>“…Didn’t sit well with you?”</p>



<p>“It didn’t. I’m dissatisfied. Unsatisfied.” Kanzaki-sensei, usually composed and indifferent, frowned distinctly.</p>



<p>“Can you forgive me?”</p>



<p>“Frankly, it’s not uncommon for high schoolers to stay out late. It’s that age. However, it could have been a big deal if it went slightly wrong. Please don’t misjudge that. Maintain a modest relationship!”</p>



<p>“I’ll keep that in mind! I’m sorry!” I straightened my back and clearly expressed my remorse.</p>



<p>“…I generally trust you, Sena-san. The one who’s more unpredictable is Arisaka-san. She’s too passionate and carefree when it comes to her boyfriend. Did she always have that much vigor?”</p>



<p>“As expected of a two-year consecutive homeroom teacher. You really understand Yorka well.”</p>



<p>I agreed with Kanzaki-sensei’s accurate assessment of Yorka.</p>



<p>“The power of love is a fearsome thing. It can draw out such initiative from Arisaka-san.”</p>



<p>“Yorka herself has always been capable. In a way, she just unleashed her true potential.”</p>



<p>“A maiden in love is invincible, isn’t she? Though a bit on the reckless side.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei looked impressed yet somewhat frustrated.</p>



<p>“Do you understand her that well?”</p>



<p>“If you stand on the class podium every day, you naturally notice changes in students. She’s been changing since last year when you started visiting the art prep room. Now, she’s a completely different person.”</p>



<p>“Is she that different? I think she’s the same in the classroom.”</p>



<p>“That girl, whenever she has free time, her eyes are always following you, Sena-san,” As if recalling that scene, Kanzaki-sensei smiled faintly. “Jealousy is cute. She felt cautious that you and a female teacher would be alone, so she came along.”</p>



<p>“What happens to my position when I get double-scolded?”</p>



<p>“That’s your own fault.”</p>



<p>“…By the way, Sensei, when did you realize that Yorka and I were dating?”</p>



<p>“I became certain during the sports festival. I watched your impressive last-minute comeback shot in response to her cheering—it’s enough to make anyone’s heart race, not just Arisaka-san’s.”</p>



<p>“Sensei, did you secretly cheer and feel your heart race too?”</p>



<p>When she noticed my grin, she tried to brush it off with an indifferent attitude. “I misspoke. Forget about it.”</p>



<p>“If it brought you joy, then my injury was worth it.”</p>



<p>“It’s those aspects of yours that worry me, Sena-san. You tend to underestimate your own pain and struggles.” Kanzaki-sensei muttered with a somewhat lonely expression.</p>



<p>“…Is that the real reason you called me out today?”</p>



<p>I had a hunch.</p>



<p>“One of your strengths is the ability to accurately imagine others’ feelings. It’s true that I’ve entrusted you with the class representative role because I’ve seen your skill in taking care of things. However, be careful not to get too close, to the point of taking on others’ pain as your own.”</p>



<p>“Are you saying I empathize too much?”</p>



<p>“Once you find out, it’s hard for you to ignore. You desperately try to resolve things and sometimes don’t mind getting hurt in the process. That’s what worries me.”</p>



<p>I presumed Sensei was referring to the incident from last summer.</p>



<p>Back then, as a member of the basketball team, I quit due to a fight that broke out during a practice match against another school. In order to protect my teammate, Nanamura Ryū, I protested. I had no regrets.</p>



<p>I couldn’t accept letting his talent be crushed by jealousy and petty quarrels.</p>



<p>However, it seemed Kanzaki-sensei was still bothered that she couldn’t overturn my dismissal from the team.</p>



<p>“I’ll handle it. Thank you for your concern.” I imprinted her words in my heart.</p>



<p>“Please do. Just a reminder to be mindful. Unconscious kindness can sometimes backfire. Otherwise, Arisaka-san might get jealous again.”</p>



<p>With that unexpected comment, I stumbled over my words. “Uh…”</p>



<p>“…Sena-san, don’t tell me you’ve already experienced it?”</p>



<p>The teacher squinted her eyes. I hastily made my escape from the student guidance room.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>After closing the door to the student guidance room, I hurried down the hallway and hid around the corner.</p>



<p>“Seriously, why is Kanzaki-sensei so sharp?”</p>



<p>Her words hit home, my heart pounded involuntarily.</p>



<p>Yesterday, taking advantage of the vulnerability after Yorka broke up with me, Hasekura Asaki, another class representative, confessed her feelings to me. Yorka then appeared, passionately declaring that we were already a couple, and Asaki-san gracefully stepped back. I genuinely respected her mature behavior.</p>



<p>“Ahhhh!? Did I rush the relationship announcement? Did you mess up, Sena Kisumi!” I shouted since there was no one around.</p>



<p>From the one-sided breakup message to Asaki-san’s unexpected confession and the subsequent reconciliation drama, my emotional rollercoaster had been quite turbulent.</p>



<p>To be honest, part of me made the relationship announcement because of that momentum and fervor.</p>



<p>However, the simple thought crossed my mind that publicly announcing our relationship might deter guys from approaching Yorka. I figured fewer people would try to confess when she was already in a relationship. Those who approached someone with a partner were a special breed, whether they were overly confident, tactless daredevils, or genuinely unable to suppress their feelings.</p>



<p>In any case, reducing unnecessary attention could lighten Yorka’s mental burden.</p>



<p>─That’s partly true, partly a pretense.</p>



<p>The truth was, I had my possessive tendencies.</p>



<p>Beautiful or not, it was honestly unpleasant when my girlfriend was approached by other guys.</p>



<p>“I don’t know. Yorka’s reaction might be a way of hiding her embarrassment, but it still makes me anxious────!?”</p>



<p>Indeed, for the first time in my life, I had a girlfriend, and I was quite ecstatic about it. Due to my lack of experience, I couldn’t be confident about her feelings. Instead, I ended up overthinking and causing unnecessary worry.</p>



<p>“Ugh, it’s lonely not being able to contact her even for a day.”</p>



<p>Since we started dating, we had been exchanging messages on LINE every day. I responded immediately to any message. It had become a daily routine. Being suddenly prohibited made it mentally tough.</p>



<p>“In front of Sensei, I tried to act cool with ‘I can endure it for a day,’ but what if her bad mood lasts longer…?”</p>



<p>A ban on communication due to the relationship announcement was beyond my expectations.</p>



<p>I pulled out my phone from my pocket and tapped on Yorka’s name.</p>



<p>“Maybe I should casually send her a message. Oh, but I’m scared she’ll read it and ignore me…”</p>



<p>I debated whether to send a brief message reporting that I had been released from the student guidance room.</p>



<p>“At least I should send a brief apology. She might forgive me easily. But again, it’s not wise to pour oil on the fire when she’s in a bad mood. Hmm, should I endure it for a day as she asked?”</p>



<p><em>Someone, please teach me the right way to handle situations like this!</em></p>



<p>As I was fretting in the corridor, unable to type the message, a voice called out from behind.</p>



<p>“Screaming in the hallway and pondering; quite busy, aren’t you? Are you a suspicious person?”</p>



<p>The voice belonged to a girl whose tone was familiar. Her teasing tone carried a hint of mockery, making me feel somewhat belittled.</p>



<p>There’s only one person who would approach me with such a cheeky attitude, but there’s no way that person was here.</p>



<p>“────”</p>



<p>To confirm the owner of the voice, I slowly turned around.</p>



<p>Standing in the twilight-lit corridor was a fashionable high school girl.</p>



<p>Her bright, tea-colored hair, reaching just above her shoulders, had a lively wave at the tips. Subtle makeup enhanced her glossy lips. She wore a discreet necklace and left the top buttons of her uniform blouse undone, revealing her collarbone. The loosened ribbon tie added to her relaxed style. Beneath the uniform, she sported a light black parka, with the zipper only closed up to her midriff. A short skirt led to legs that are neither too thin nor too thick, appearing healthy. The short socks emphasized her ankles.</p>



<p>She deliberately disheveled her uniform, enjoying it as her own fashion statement.</p>



<p>And brand new loafers.</p>



<p>“It’s been a year, Ki-senpai.”</p>



<p>“……Sayu?”</p>



<p>“Yes, that’s me. Surprised?”</p>



<p>“Really, Yukinami Sayu?”</p>



<p>“Why use my full name? Don’t tell me you’ve forgotten my face.”</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/img_1_7-book_reader_readera.png" alt="" /></div></figure>
</figure>



<p>She approached, looking up at my face. The faint fragrance tickling my nose was undoubtedly Sayu’s favorite shampoo.</p>



<p>“No, I remember. Of course.”</p>



<p>Her name was Yukinami Sayu. She was my junior in the same middle school, and also in the basketball club one year below me.</p>



<p>And now, she appeared before me in the uniform of Eisei High School.</p>
