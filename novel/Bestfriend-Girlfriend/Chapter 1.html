<h2>Chapter One: Angel Corone Wants to Be Pierced and Mocked</h2>

<p>About 10 minutes earlier – <br />“Crush the [Ten Sai].” <br /> <br />In the principal’s office of the prestigious Teiou Academy, the room’s master, Ougami Ai, said this in a familiar tone.  <br /> <br />It’s strange. For the principal to be a woman with model-rivaling body and beauty, looking to be only in her twenties no matter how you look at her. <br /> <br />It’s strange. With round glasses perched on her nose, dressed in a deep red suit, and a bright red rose and chrysanthemum in her breast pocket – for someone dressed so ridiculously to be the principal.  <br /> <br />It’s strange. Lounging back in her chair with her feet on the desk to greet a student like this as the principal.  <br /> <br />The principal is the top authority responsible for managing a school corporation. With higher standing than the principal who is responsible for the school itself.  <br /> <br />And this place is recognized by all as the number one high school in Japan, so someone like this being at the top just doesn’t make sense no matter how you think about it. <br /> <br />And above all, what she’s saying is strange. <br /> <br />For me to crush that [Ten Sai]…? <br /> <br />“Um…I have absolutely no idea what you mean…” <br /> <br />“Oh I see. I haven’t explained the reason yet.” <br /> <br />“No, that’s not it, it’s just…” <br /> <br />“The current Ten Sai is too strong.” <br /> <br />This woman isn’t listening to me at all… <br /> <br />“They’re far too absolute, crushing the spirits of the other students. There are almost no guys who have the spirit to try taking the Ten Sai’s seats, it’s so boring watching…so damn boring. Liven it up somehow.” <br /> <br />She’s like a child… <br /> <br />“But, there’s no way someone like me could do anything against that monster group right… You’re the principal of this academy aren’t you? Shouldn’t it be about proper management and not things like boring or…”</p>

<br />“No. With them unchanging in the current membership, fierce competition for the Ten Sai seats used to unfold. It was an extremely delightful situation, but look now? Every single one of them is sorely lacking… If things continue this way, Teiou Academy’s foundations may be shaken.”  <br /> <br />As a high schooler, I don’t fully comprehend, but I guess that’s how it is… <br /> <br />“However, it would be cruel to blame those tamed guys. The might of those ten is beyond high school level.” <br /> <br />“But still, there’s no way I can do anything against a monstrous group like that…” <br /> <br />“That is also incorrect. My eye that scouted you is absolute. Look, it’s written about in this magazine too. [Since Ougami Ai assumed the position of principal, the [excellent] Teiou Academy has become an [outstanding] existence. Even the current [Ten Sai] called the strongest ever, with nine out of the ten being her own scouts – she possesses not only business management ability as the director, but also outstanding insight for discovering talent.] See?” <br /> <br />“You’re holding a horse racing magazine principal…you’re just quoting yourself right?” <br /> <br />But considering Teiou’s rise over the past decade or so, I can’t just call it big talk either… <br /> <br />“If the principal’s judgment of people is truly discerning as she claims, then I understand your meaning even less. If I have any outstanding traits compared to others, it is only misfortune – as I only have negative elements.” <br /> <br />“Hah, we’ll see if you’re truly a man of just misfortune or not – it will become clear once I throw you into the classroom,”  <br /> <br />“Even if we assume for argument’s sake that I do have that ability…I would never try to crush the Ten Sai.” <br /> <br />“Oh? Why not?” <br /> <br />“—I don’t want to stand out.” <br /> <br />That is the one and only, and greatest goal in my life.  <br /> <br />“I want to live modestly. I was already fed up with the totally normal school caste at my previous school, and the Ten Sai is like the extreme of that kind of system right? Getting involved with flashy people like that…let alone crushing them, no thank you. I just want to live a dull, ordinary life as much as possible.” <br /> <br />Words that calm my heart like stable, peaceful, steady, gradual progress… <br /> <br />“That’s quite a withered outlook for a 16 year old. Is it a reaction from being exposed to misfortune since childhood—” <br /> <br />Ougami principal paused for a moment before opening her mouth. <br /> <br />“Or is it due to family influences?” <br /> <br />“—!?” <br /> <br />“Looks like I hit the mark huh.”  <br /> <br />“…………” <br /> <br />—Yes, my parents are famous people.  <br /> <br />And not just any old famous people either. <br /> <br />To use a terribly cliche expression – they’re national stars. <br /> <br />“Well, it’s not that rare for children of great parents to aim for the exact opposite path.” <br /> <br />That’s true…ever since I was little, I’ve seen it. My father and mother’s charisma, fascinating and captivating people with their innate talent—and at the same time, the endless trouble it brought. <br /> <br />I swore in my heart. That I would absolutely live inconspicuously.  <br /> <br />“I must decline after all. Please rescind your offer.” <br /> <br />I deeply bowed my head to Ougami principal, then turned my back on her. <br /> <br />Maybe I’d get expelled for defying the principal’s wishes? But it’s doubtful she’d immediately dismiss someone she scouted herself just for that— <br /> <br />Crash! <br /> <br />“Ow!?” <br /> <br />Along with a loud noise, pain shot through my butt.  <br /> <br />“Wh-what the…a baseball!?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[I-I’m terribbly s-sorryyy!] <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Soon after, a bubbly voice echoed in from outside the window.  <br /> <br />The baseball team practicing in the morning hit a ball that broke through the glass window and directly struck my ass…? Wh-what are the odds…my misfortune really exceeds limits sometimes. <br /> <br />“Kuhaha, don’t worry about it, don’t worry. I got to see something more interesting than that.” <br /> <br />Ougami principal cheerfully picked up the white ball and threw it back out to the baseball club members below. <br /> <br />“No, you really know how to entertain right from the start. You sure nailed the ‘not wanting to stand out’ part.” <br /> <br />“Guh…” <br /> <br />“Well, if this is all the minor misfortune that keeps happening, then perhaps it’s possible to bury oneself in the Teio academy, renowned for its individuality. You must have come with that sort of plan, right?” <br /> <br />“…You seem to see through everything.” <br /> <br />“That’s why I say they write about me as a peerless genius in horse racing magazines.” <br /> <br />“You’ve really mixed things up, haven’t you…” <br /> <br />“These petty strokes of bad luck are just the opening act. When you’re a genius like me, having a ball hit your butt—it’s nothing short of the beginning of destiny!” <br /> <br />Those are some terrible puns. <br /> <br />“I can feel it… My ‘dangerous guy’ sensor is going off like crazy! Youta Ootomo, you truly are a talent who can crush the ‘Imperial Flower Ten Blooms’ system itself! I’ve never been wrong about a student’s potential. Not even once!” <br /> <br />“Haha… In that case, I must be your first.” <br /> <br />This is the story of a man named Youta Ootomo, leading a stable, peaceful, steady, and down-to-earth life. <br /> </p>

<br />After that exchange with Ougami principal, in the classroom— <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose ] <br /> </p>

<p></p>



<p> <br /> <br /> <br />“Why!?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Wh-what is this…? <br /> <br />The thing that suddenly welled up in my mind wasn’t text or audio.  <br /> <br />It felt like the information poured directly into my brain…anyway, I was being forced to choose between absurd options. <br /> <br />It’s far too unrealistic, but the choices sat firmly in my mind, showing no signs of disappearing any time soon.  <br /> <br />As if urging me to choose quickly. <br /> <br />However, naturally there was no way I would obey such nonsensical choices. <br /> <br />The instant I tried to ignore it— <br /> <br />“Gyaaaaaaahhh!” <br /> <br />Incredible headache assailed me. <br /> <br />C-Could it be…I have to choose one or the other by force…? <br /> <br />Don’t mess with— <br /> <br />“Gyaahhhhhhh!” <br /> <br />No good! Impossible! Absolutely no way I can endure this!! <br /> <br />“……………” <br /> <br />In contrast to me writhing in pain, the class was looking at me in disdain. <br /> <br />Well, if a transfer student suddenly cries out and starts suffering in the middle of their self-introduction, this kind of reaction is only natural I guess. <br /> <br />Nooooo it hurts, is choosing the only…way to make it stop!? <br /> <br /> <br /> </p>



<p>“Squee!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The moment I decided on 1 and put it into action, <br /> <br />The headache disappeared as if it were a lie—but in exchange, <br /> <br />“Huh…?” <br /> <br />Everyone’s eyes turned to dots. <br /> <br />And the classroom was wrapped in an unbearable atmosphere, with hushed whispers breaking out here and there. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Whoa, more interesting that expected.”<br />“Yeah, with the weird timing of transferring in two weeks after the entrance ceremony, I thought he might be some genius…but he’s just crazy.”<br />“And trying to be funny is way too tasteless…the weird shouts are bad enough, why a pig?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />C-Crap, super noticeable all of a sudden! I-I’ve gotta recover somehow! <br /> <br />“Cough…ahem…cough!” <br /> <br />I conspicuously cleared my throat and stood up, bowing deeply. <br /> <br />“I’m very sorry! Getting carried away after transferring to the respected Teiou Academy I admire, I did something incomprehensible. I sincerely apologize for causing discomfort! Please think nothing of it!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Huh, surprisingly sensible?”<br />“Yeah, his way of talking seems proper.”<br />“Well transferring in must put crazy pressure on him.” “<br />And looking closely he has quite a refreshing face doesn’t he?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Yes…yes! Recovery is still possible here. If I firmly correct things here and leave an impression of my dullness, I can manage! <br /> <br />“So once again…I’m Youta Ootomo. What I wanted to convey earlier wasn’t that. To prevent secondary harm, what you absolutely must know about me is—” </p>

An absolute…idiot! <br /> <br />2 is completely criminal…compared to that 1 is way better— No no, neither is any better. <br /> <br />My senses feel numbed, but the choices are either my school life ending or my actual life ending. <br /> <br />But—  <br /> <br />“Ngh…” <br /> <br />A jabbing headache occurs, as if saying I know right?  <br /> <br />Resisting will definitely bring intense pain again. <br /> <br />I have no choice but to…do it. <br /> <br />“They’re…salmon pink.”  <br /> </p>



<p> <br />” ” ” ” ” ” ? ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ”  <br /> </p>


<p>With those tear-filled words, everyone tilted their heads in unison. <br /> <br />Oh, that’s natural. Without context, they wouldn’t know what I’m talking about. O-Ooh, could I have gotten through this—  <br /> <br />“Gyaaaaahhhhhhh!” <br /> <br />Again with the incredible headache…ngh…as I thought, looks like I have to explicitly state it. </p>



<p><br />“M-My…nipples are salmon pink.” <br />” ” ” ” ” ” …………… What? ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” <br />My classmates’ eyes had turned to dots again. Uu…of course this would happen.  <br /> <br />Next, the homeroom teacher hesitantly went… <br /> <br />“Ootomo…was that really something you had to say no matter what…?” <br /> <br />“Of course not!” <br /> <br />I retorted with full power on impulse.  <br /> <br />“O-Oh…” <br /> <br />The teacher recoiled as if repelled by my sharp tongue. <br /> <br />“Ah, no, sorry, I’m shaken up…shall I continue…?” <br /> <br />“D-Don’t mind…is that all?” <br /> <br />No. it’s bad …… I’m finished. <br /> <br />No good…nothing I say from this point can recover things.  <br /> <br />“I see…your seat is over there.” <br /> <br />“Yes…” <br /> <br />I replied in an almost inaudible voice and shambled over to the indicated seat. <br /> <br />It’s over…utterly over.  <br /> <br />Staring blankly up at the ceiling in despair, I was walking ahead when—  <br /> <br />Slip! <br /> <br />“Woah!?” <br /> <br />I slipped on something and plopped down on my butt. <br /> <br />“Owww…” <br /> <br />As if things weren’t bad enough…on top of the weird mental choices, my misfortune too… <br /> <br />In a sense, business as usual I guess but there’s no need for this now of all times— <br /> <br />“Wh-What the hell…” <br /> <br />A voice, shaking with anger, interrupted my thoughts.  <br /> <br />Looking up from my butt-flop state, the owner of the voice was— <br /> <br />“You…what kind of man are you…” <br /> <br />The student who looked like a delinquent boss from earlier. <br /> <br />“What’s wrong, Ishibashi?” <br /> <br />“Oh, sorry teach. Just got too moved by the transfer student’s spirit is all.”  <br /> <br />The male student called Ishibashi extended a hand to me still plopped on my butt. <br /> <br />“Take my hand, transfer student…no, Ootomo Youta. I thank you for saving this Ishibashi Go.” <br /> <br />“Huh…? Ah, sorry.” <br /> <br />I didn’t really understand what he meant, but I took his hand and stood up. <br /> <br />“Hey you guys, you’re thinking this dude’s some total perv right!? But that’s a huge misunderstanding! A huuuuge one!” <br /> <br />Ishibashi suddenly bellowed loudly.  <br /> <br />“”””?””””<br /> <br />Question marks popped up above everyone’s heads amidst his shouting, and then a female student spoke. <br /> <br />“Ishibashi-kun? What do you mean?” <br /> <br />“Oh…actually, I received prior notice that a transfer student was coming. That’s because I’m the class rep.” <br /> <br />Huh? This delinquent-like guy is the class rep…as expected of the extraordinary Teiou. <br /> <br />“With transferring at such an odd time mid-semester. A transfer student has to be filled with anxiety. To alleviate that even a little, I prepared a surprise present.” <br /> <br />What an unexpectedly nice class rep…I reflected on judging him just by his looks. <br /> <br />Ishibashi picked up the dropped [culprit] and held it up before me.  <br /> <br />“That being this [Monthly My Fundoshi].” <br /> <br />“Say what!?” <br /> <br />“Oh right, it doesn’t make sense without explanation. Not to brag, but I, the unworthy Ishibashi Go, am the heir to the world’s largest men’s fundoshi care product manufacturer.” <br /> <br />“What kind of rich kid is he!?” <br /> <br />“So of course, my present to you would naturally be the [Monthly My Fundoshi] published by the publishing company affiliated with my company—” <br /> <br />“No naturalness at all there…I mean, I’d think there were better options even if I’m the one receiving it…” <br /> <br />“What’d ya say, punk!? Don’t tell me a rival company’s fundoshi magazine is better!?”  <br /> <br />“That’s not what I meant! And I’m shocked there’s multiple fundoshi magazines!” <br /> <br />“Hmph…forget it. Anyway, the point is, I had prepared a surprise in advance, but here’s where I made a fatal mistake.”  <br /> <br />Ishibashi continued spinning his words with a sigh. <br /> <br />“I accidentally…prepared the 70s edition of [Monthly My Fundoshi].” <br /> <br />“There are age-specific editions!? Just how segmented is it! Where’d the publishing depression go!” <br /> <br />Paying zero attention to my retorts, Ishibashi continued immersing himself in his own world. <br /> <br />“The special feature was [Return my nipples to the salmon pink of my youthful days].” <br /> <br />“Ishibashi-kun, don’t tell me…” <br /> <br />The female student from earlier seemed to realize something as she covered her mouth with her palm. <br /> </p>



<p>“That’s right. Seeing the magazine fall from the podium, Oootomo realized everything. And in order not to embarrass me…to make me realize it was a mistake, he deliberately announced the color of his own nipples as salmon pink…”  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />No no no no no no… <br /> <br />There’s no way he could deduce all that just from that. Even hyper suspicious detectives in mysteries nowadays wouldn’t say stuff like “Hmmm, something’s suspicious…” at that stage yet. <br /> <br />“But even after he did that much, I still didn’t realize my own mistake. I didn’t even notice that I had dropped the magazine in the first place. So Oootomo intentionally stepped on it, slipped, and fell to make only me aware of its existence…That’s everything that happened in this classroom!” <br /> <br />….You’ve got it all wrong, but is this okay? <br /> <br />“And that’s not all! He didn’t try to defend himself until I brought it up…even at the cost of being accused of being a pervert, he prioritized protecting my reputation…How can you not call this a true man!? If there are still any who doubt this man’s character, I Ishibashi Go will be your opponent!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Oh, to make Ishibashi-kun say all that…” “Amazing! If Ishibashi-kun acknowledges it, there’s no mistake!” “Damn…I’m pathetic for doubting such a guy…!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />C-Could this be…a good development? <br /> <br />“I, class rep Ishibashi Go, hereby declare! Starting from this moment, Oootomo Youta is our comrade!” <br /> <br />With Ishibashi’s declaration as the start— <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Oootomo!” “Oootomo!” “Oootomo!” “Oootomo!” “Oootomo!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Class 2-1 was enveloped in a mysterious chant of my name. <br /> <br />Wh-what’s going on here… <br /> <br />Tossed around by the mysterious choices, and with misfortune piling on, I was resigned to a hopeless school life, but with this sudden situation… <br /> <br />Surely just a coincidence, but I’ve never had such a lucky development in my life before.  <br /> <br />Alright…this timing is best to make everyone aware of my misfortune!  <br /> <br />“Thank you everyone! And here, please let me say what I’ve been trying to convey all this time! The truth is that I—” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose] <br /> </p>

<br />Lunch break after 4th period ended. <br /> <br />“Uuuu….” <br /> <br />I was alone, holding my head on the roof. <br /> <br />What is it…just what on earth is that!? <br /> <br />The mental choices appearing suddenly, with absolute compulsion—  <br /> <br />Thanks to that thing, my peaceful school life had come to an end. <br /> <br />The favorable impression from my classmates (?) thanks to class rep Ishibashi had recovered my standing considerably, but my mother’s underwear declaration sent my stock plunging straight to limit down. <br /> <br />Everyone was whispering while watching me from afar…not a single person had spoken to me after homeroom. <br /> <br />Misfortune? …Could that actually be a new form of misfortune? <br /> <br />…No, something feels a little off about that idea. My normal misfortune is more like— <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Plop! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Bird poop struck my shoulder directly. <br /> <br />Right, this, this is my normal misfortune. This feeling, it’s kind of reassuring—  <br /> <br />“No, nothing reassuring about getting crapped on by a bird…that’s poop landing on me…” <br /> <br />I unconsciously retorted myself, but I’m certain. <br /> <br />That’s different. <br /> <br />Those mental choices are something else entirely from my regular misfortune. <br /> <br />Just intuition, but I’m not mistaken after dozens of years of misfortune experience.  <br /> <br />But in that case, just what— <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose ] <br /> </p>

<p> <br />“Who’s Joe!?” <br /> <br />I reflexively shouted, but there it was again…that weird choice popped up again. <br /> <br />Just what the hell is this— <br /> <br />“Gahhhhhh!” <br /> <br />Ngh…the jabbing headache if I don’t choose is the same huh… Well if I had to pick one, better a beautiful girl than some wet Joe. <br /> <br />With that thinking, the instant I selected 1— <br /> <br />“Hm?” <br /> <br />Sensing something, I looked up and…some sparkling object? <br /> <br />No way…a beautiful girl is really gonna fall!? <br /> <br />I-If that’s the case, I’ve gotta catch her or there’ll be big trouble! <br /> <br />Umm…first roughly predict the spot, then look around for something mattress-like to—huh, fast!? <br /> <br />Whoa…no time to look for a mattress! I’ve got no choice but to catch her directly— <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />** Slam! ** <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Wahhhhhhh!” <br /> <br />This is awful! …It’s awfullll! <br /> <br />Getting smashed from that height, I’d have no chance at survival— <br /> <br />…Dumbfounded by the situation, I stood motionless.  <br /> <br />In time, the swirling dust cleared and visibility returned. What entered my eyes was—  <br /> <br />“Legs…?” <br /> <br />Legs.  <br /> <br />To be precise, legs growing out of the ground. <br /> <br />Even more precisely, legs sticking straight up in a V-shape with the upper body stabbed into the ground. <br /> <br />…………What does this mean? <br /> <br />No matter how many times I rewatched it, I could not understand what I saw before my eyes. <br /> <br />I understand it mentally. That I need to contact emergency services and teachers urgently.  <br /> <br />But the scene is so surreal my mind and body have frozen up— <br /> <br />“Heyyy, you there!” <br /> <br />“Gyaaaaahhh!?” <br /> <br />She’s alive!? No way…no way she’d be unharmed after falling from that height… <br /> <br />“Pfft hahaha! Let me tell you what you’re most wondering about right now.” <br /> <br />Though her mouth is buried in the concrete, muffling her voice, I could clearly make out a girl’s voice around my age. <br /> <br />“Why my skirt isn’t flipping up and you can’t see my panties, it’s defying gravity right?” <br /> <br />“That’s not important right now! First—” <br /> <br />Admittedly the skirt’s state is puzzling, but there are much more pressing issues here. <br /> <br />“A-Are you okay!? …Are you really okay like this!? Is…is this okay!?”  <br /> <br />“Ahaha! I don’t need an ambulance or anything~ See, I’m perfectly fine right?”  <br /> <br />The girl(?) energetically wiggled her legs, narrowing and widening the V-angle…too surreal. <br /> <br />“Look, I can see you’re fine, but…more than that, shouldn’t you be dead in the first place…?” <br /> <br />“Well I guess you’d think that huh. Since it’s a pain to explain like this, mind pulling me out?” <br /> <br />“Me…pull you out?” <br /> <br />“Yup. I can’t get out myself you see. Ahh, I should’ve thought a bit more. Even as fanservice for you, I might’ve overdone it a little.”  <br /> <br />“F-Fanservice?” <br /> <br />“That’s right. You definitely love [head stabbed into the floor girl] sexy videos right?” <br /> <br />“That’s too niche! You won’t find a category tab for that no matter where you look!” <br /> <br />“Oh was I wrong? Anyway, mind pulling me out?” <br /> <br />“Ah…sure…” <br /> <br />Still completely confused, I approached the girl’s side. <br /> <br />“Okay, gonna touch you…” <br /> <br />I hesitantly placed my hands on her waist. <br /> <br />“Ahaha! You’re worrying too much and it’s making you touch weirdly~ Must be an a virgin huh.” <br /> <br />…My bad.  <br /> <br />She seems to have quite the jesting personality, but…Anyway, the conversation won’t progress if I don’t pull her out. <br /> <br />“Ah!” <br /> <br />The instant I applied force, the girl let out a coquettish voice. <br /> <br />“S-Sorry…” <br /> <br />Startled by the unexpected reaction, I quickly released my hands. <br /> <br />“I-I’m fine…just surprised me a little so keep going, I don’t mind…” <br /> <br />“Oh, o-okay then…” <br /> <br />I grasped her body again and pushed with force— <br /> <br />“Mm!” <br /> <br />“!?” <br /> <br />An even more sensitive reaction than before startled me into recoiling. <br /> <br />“D-Did I touch you weirdly? I didn’t mean to…”  <br /> <br />“Haah…haa…s-sorry, my bad…not being able to see makes me extra sensitive…but that’s because my true identity is sensitive, it can’t be helped…” <br /> <br />“True identity?” <br /> <br />“Yes. Actually, I’m not human.”  <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“I mean, could a normal human fall from that height and be totally fine?” <br /> <br />Well she has a point but… <br /> <br />“I’m actually the personified form of a certain something.”  <br /> <br />Personification…that’s like, pretty common in anime and games of battleships and animals turning into beautiful girls right? This thing before me is one of those? <br /> <br />S-Something so unrealistic but…the fact she’s stabbed headfirst concretely into the ground is also reality.  <br /> <br />“W-Whether believable or not…just what were you personified from?” <br /> <br />“[Erotic shaped daikon radish]” <br /> <br />“Who would want such a thing!?”  <br /> <br />This girl…that weird voice from before was totally on purpose…forget it, I’ll just pull her out roughly! <br /> <br />Shlump! <br /> <br />“Oh nice, got me out got me out~ Man, roof air is great huh. So refresssshing~” <br /> <br />Seeing the girl stand up and stretch before me, I— <br /> <br />“…………” <br /> <br />Froze up in spite of myself.  <br /> <br />Because that existence was far too perfect. <br /> </p>


<p>Jutting out violently where it should jut out, and withdrawing where it should withdraw, ideal proportions. And her facial features were also eerily orderly. <br /> <br />It’s not the cute or pretty you’d see with idols or actresses. As I said eerily orderly but…that still feels insufficient to describe just how orderly she seems.  <br /> <br />Something superhuman, an aura as if not of this world…to use a terribly cliche metaphor, it was as if an ang— <br /> <br />“Oh right, I haven’t introduced myself yet. No point hiding it, I’m an angel sent down from the heavens above! That’s what I am!” <br /> <br />An, angel? While I did have that impression from her divine appearance, that was just a metaphor for the ethereal feel of her looks, not that I imagined she had a literal ring over her head. <br /> <br />“Oh, that face says you don’t believe me huh? I get it, I get it. It’s not something you can accept easily~ Then, as proof of my angelhood, I’ll point out something about you that only you in the whole world could know ‘kay?” <br /> <br />And she placed her index finger on her own temple and tapped tap tap. <br /> <br />“The mental choices occurring in your brain.” <br /> <br />“—!?” <br /> <br />How does she know that? I haven’t breathed a word of it to anyone yet…that’s something impossible unless she somehow peeked directly into my mind right? She couldn’t be seriously…a being surpassing human knowledge? <br /> <br />“Fufun, believe me now? Let me reintroduce myself then. My name is Corone. I’m a bona fide angel girl sent to help you ok~?”  <br /> <br />The girl calling herself Corone struck a silly pose going panpakapaaan! while mimicking trumpet sounds. <br /> <br />“I’m Oootomo…Youta.”  <br /> <br />“Uh huh, nice to meetcha Youtan. I’ve been tasked by the heavenly realm to support you fully, so feel free to consult me ’bout anything ‘kay?” <br /> <br />“The heavenly realm? Oh, you mean heaven. My support meaning…the stuff about the mental choices right?” <br /> <br />“Yup. That’s a [curse] from the heavenly realm – something that shouldn’t exist in the human world. My objective is to lift that [curse].”  <br /> <br />“A [curse] huh…Oh wait. Could it be that all the ridiculous misfortune I’ve suffered all this time is also part of that [curse]?” <br /> <br />“Ah nope, not that. Your misfortune has nothing to do with any supernatural phenomena. You just simply have astronomically bad luck, that’s all.” <br /> <br />…………….I see. <br /> <br />Right after being let down by that excessively blunt truth—</p>



<div><img src="https://postimg.cc/4HfJ4Gnj " alt="" /></div>


<p>Plop. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Bird poop directly hit my shoulder again. <br /> <br />“And in the exact same spot as earlier…well consecutive ones aren’t that rare but…” <br /> <br />“Oh Youtan, this might be a little different.”  <br /> <br />“Hm?” <br /> <br />“Unlike the white poop from before, this one’s transparent and sparkly see—going by the aura, it’s a heavenly realm resident’s excretion.” <br /> <br />“Excretion?” <br /> <br />“Yup. Sometimes they come down to the human world by chance. But they’re super rare since it’s reeeally occasional.”  <br /> <br />“It certainly has a shine unlike anything of this world…could it perhaps be angel tears or something?” <br /> <br />“It’s God’s vomit.” <br /> <br />“Say what!?” <br /> <br />“God of woro.” <br /> <br />“Don’t randomly say game-sounding stuff!” <br /> <br />I vigorously scrubbed off the divine vomitus.  <br /> <br />“But seeing it in person, it really is awful huh. You said this misfortune has nothing to do with the heavenly realm and is just coincidental…it really is shocking.” <br /> <br />“Well it is related to the heavenly realm…God’s puking directly on me…” <br /> <br />“But this is simply indecent behavior from drinking too much, the misfortune itself has no supernatural influence whatsoever you know? That is the official heavenly view.” <br /> <br />So as you said before, I’m just super unlucky… <br /> <br />“But the mental choices are different you know, big brother. That [curse] doesn’t occur spontaneously, there’s definitely someone’s intent involved.”  <br /> <br />“Someone’s intent…Does the heavenly realm have any leads on the culprit?” <br /> <br />“Nope sadly, not yet. But actually, a similar incident occurred previously. That case is completely resolved now but…the one cursed then was a high schooler like you…well like you he was an M-type, so while he struggled, he somehow managed to live a normal high school life.” <br /> <br />…Please don’t arbitrarily judge me as an M. <br /> <br />“But in that person’s case, it was only the mental choices in their brain. In your case, the misfortune you were born with is added on top too. Honestly, it exceeds what one person can handle right? Helping to prevent your mind from going into overload is also part of my mission you see.” <br /> <br />“I see, so that’s what support means…” <br /> <br />“Yup. So consult me if things get tough ‘kay…I’ll heal you with lewd stuff.” <br /> <br />“Ha? …H-Hold on, saying that stuff out of nowhere…it’s not like that kind of thing would be healing or anything—” <br /> <br />“Reallyyy? Are you suuure?” <br /> <br />“—Huh?”  <br /> <br />Corone’s face was right before me. <br /> <br />“The fastest way to cheer up depressed boys…is lewd stuff riiight?” </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p> <br />A sweet…bewitching scent, making my brain fuzzy.  <br /> <br />“It’s fine. After all the hardship till now…having a lil’ something nice is fine right?” <br /> <br />Corone’s finger poked and traced my nape.  <br /> <br />“Lewd stuff… wanna do it?” <br /> <br />“N-No way! That kind of thing is for people who love each other, dammit…”  <br /> <br />“It’s okay…I’m an angel so no count.” <br /> <br />“That’s not the issue…” <br /> <br />“Fufu, just give in…well if Youtan refuses I’ll just force my way with lewd stuff anyway~” <br /> <br />Corone gently grasped both my cheeks in her hands.  <br /> <br />“Mm…” <br /> </p>



<p>Her strength…her strength is too much, I can’t break free. <br /> <br />“S-Stop! This kind of thing is no good by force!” <br /> <br />“Sorry…even if you don’t like it, I’ve gotten into the mood for lewd stuff with Youtan.” <br /> <br />Corone’s lips drew close to mine—  <br /> <br />“Cu-Cut it outtttttt!” <br /> <br />“Okay, all done.” <br /> <br />“Huh…?” <br /> <br />Right before our lips touched, I’m released. <br /> <br />“Oh…done?” <br /> <br />“Hmmm? What’s wrong Youtan? Even though you were saying stop, were you actually kinda expecting it?” <br /> <br />“N-No way!” <br /> <br />It’s true I didn’t like it since we aren’t lovers…but if asked whether I had even 1% wicked thoughts…I’m a high school boy at that age too. If a girl this pretty says lewd stuff lewd stuff to me, mentally I may refuse but physically my body reacts.  <br /> <br />“But I wasn’t lying you know? I already had my fill of lewd stuff.” <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“Yup. [Praying in my heart for the serialization of HU◯TER×HUNTE○ to resume.]” <br /> <br />“Everyone in the whole country does that every day!” <br /> <br />You…well, not a guy but…that’s way too mischievous no matter what.  <br /> <br />Just as I was about to voice my protest— <br /> <br />“But you know, [Support Oootomo Youta so his mind doesn’t reach its limit] is for real.” <br /> <br />Corone’s tone changed ever so slightly. <br /> <br />“Sorry about that. I was teasing too much just now, but I really did want you to cheer up and have fun. So really, tell me anytime if it gets tough ‘kay? I’m always on your side Youtan.” <br /> <br />She still had a jesting feel, but I sensed no falsehood in her eyes. <br /> <br />“I see…just having one person who understands the circumstances makes me feel quite a bit lighter—but I don’t think I’ll end up in the dire situation Corone is worried about.” <br /> <br />“Oh, is that right?” <br /> <br />“Yeah. I’ve decided—whatever misfortune comes, whatever [curse] is added, I won’t let it get me down or irritated in each moment. The one thing I absolutely won’t do is live a gloomy life because of unreasonable things.”  <br /> <br />“Oooh, positive outlook huh.” <br /> <br />If I became gloomy and listless alone, it’d stand out in a bad way. To maintain my life goal of [not standing out], I can’t afford to be depressed over every little thing.  <br /> <br />“So don’t worry. No matter how much misfortune strikes or the [curse] piles on, I will never—” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose ] <br /> <br />① Groveling for Corone to [step on me] while prostrate  <br /> <br />② Opening my mouth facing up to beg Corone to [drool on me] <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Forcing to physically step on me is too much!” <br /> <br />And 2 is too extreme! <br /> <br />…But the silver lining is that it’s Corone, who understands the circumstances of the choices. And I’m just begging, it’s not actually going to happen—I just have to endure the humiliation of prostrating, so it’s effectively no risk. <br /> <br />I got on all fours and rubbed my forehead on the floor.  <br /> <br />“Please step on me.” <br /> <br />Squish! <br /> <br />“Why are you actually stepping on me!?” <br /> <br />“Well, I couldn’t tell if you were saying it because of the choices or of your own will.”  <br /> <br />“You should know! It’s me we’re talking about!” <br /> <br />“M.” <br /> <br />“That’s right!” <br /> <br />“Ahaha, just jokin’ jokin’. I even took my shoes off and just lightly touched with my soles see? Squishy squishy.” <br /> <br />“You really are an easygoing person huh…” <br /> <br />But these choices are the worst. <br /> <br />The misfortune hasn’t caused any major harm yet, but with the choices, I don’t know what’ll happen going forward…or rather, even now the two options are mostly immediate no-gos. <br /> <br />“Corone…Find the cause as soon as possible—” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose ] <br /> <br />① A crow’s beak stabs into your anus <br /> <br />② Classmate Ishibashi stabs into your anus <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“That delinquent-like guy stabbing me would kill me!” <br /> <br />Don’t joke around! There’s no way I can choose either of these— <br /> <br />“Gyyyaaaaaaaahhh!” <br /> <br />Right after, I was assaulted by indescribable headache pain. <br /> <br />N-No good…I have no choice but to choose… <br /> <br />The instant I reluctantly selected 1 while crying— <br /> <br />“Cawww!” <br /> <br />No way? A caw I didn’t hear at all until now…  <br /> <br />“Woooaaaaa!” <br /> <br />Knowing it was likely futile, I still turned my back on the crow and dashed away at full speed. <br /> <br />I don’t wanna…even if it results in getting stabbed in the end, at least buy some time— <br /> <br />Slip! <br /> <br />“Woah!?” <br /> <br />At a time like this…a banana peel! <br /> <br />With the combo of the choices and misfortune at the worst timing, I stumbled and fell forward.  <br /> <br />And since I reflexively thrust my hands out, I ended up in a crawling position. <br /> <br />C-Crap! Like this, facing the attacking crow with my butt sticking out— <br /> <br />“Gyaaaaaaahhh!” <br /> <br />Something hard and thick entered deep inside. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Uuu…uuu…sniff…” <br /> <br />Feeling like something precious had been stolen from me, something faintly shining entered my eyes. <br /> <br />My butt…my butt hurts like it’s gonna split open. <br /> <br />Since it was stabbed while I was on all fours, it probably went in deeper than if I had been standing.  <br /> <br />Damn…because the choices and misfortune combined, it became the worst possible outcome… <br /> <br />“Caw…caw…caw…” <br /> <br />” hmm? ” <br /> <br />Hearing a feeble voice, I glanced over and saw the crow swaying powerlessly.  <br /> <br />And then— </p>


<p><br /> <br />“GEroGEroGEroGEro!” <br /> <br />After vomiting vigorously, it fluttered away unsteadily.  <br /> <br />“I feel kinda bad for the crow too…huh?” <br /> <br />Mixed in the crow’s vomit, I noticed something sparkling. <br /> <br />“What’s that…?” <br /> <br />“Doesn’t it look kinda like a gem?” <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“Ah, no doubt about it. It’s super tiny but this is a real diamond.”  <br /> <br />“Ha? The diamond…the crow had swallowed it?” <br /> <br />“That’s right. It probably threw up because your butt smelled so bad.” <br /> <br />Let it go… <br /> <br />“By the way Youtan, that crow came out in the choices right? What were they?” <br /> <br />“Oh, the first one was—” <br /> <br />As asked, I told Corone the content of the choices. <br /> <br />“I see I see. Then misfortune activated and you slipped on the banana peel…that lined up your butt just right for the crow’s beak to stab in deeply…and as a result, unable to bear the stench, the crow threw up the diamond, I see.” <br /> <br />Putting it into words makes the unfolding events seem absurdly stupid… <br /> <br />“Well, it might just be too convenient a coincidence. Anyway, we should turn this in to the police—” <br /> <br />“Hmm…might not be a coincidence.” <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“Hey Youtan, mind if I take some pics?” <br /> <br />“Pictures? …I guess that’s fine but…” <br /> <br />Why so suddenly? The conversation feels disconnected… </p>



<p>“Okay, so get on all fours and show your an*s~” </p>



<p>“Why!?” </p>



<p>“Eh, cause you said I could take pics right?” </p>



<p>“No, normally you’d think of my face right…why do you wanna take pics of such a filthy place?” </p>



<p>“Ah don’t worry don’t worry. I’ll use the highest resolution burst shots for maximum clarity~” </p>



<p>“A high res an*s is filthier! Who’d let you take pics of that!” </p>



<p>“Boo boo. Your butt hole is tiny~” </p>



<p>Saying slick stuff to annoy me… <br /> <br />But still, this girl…I thought she was weird but suddenly demanding butt pics is way overboard no matter what. <br /> <br />“Oh right, I haven’t explained yet. When the earlier diamond thing happened, I felt like there was some kinda aura distortion around Youtan’s butt area. </p>



<p>So I wanna take pics of it and have the heavenly analysis team take a look. </p>



<p>“Oh right, I haven’t explained yet. When the earlier diamond thing happened, I felt like there was some kinda aura distortion around Youtan’s butt area. So I wanna take pics of it and have the heavenly analysis team take a look. When I jokingly said an*s earlier, I didn’t mean zoomed in there, clothed butt pics are fine.” </p>



<p>“No, then say that from the start…” </p>



<p>“Meow haha, ‘kay got it. Sending the pic now…there!”  </p>



<p>About a minute or two after Corone operated the smartphone-like device— </p>



<p>“Oh, looks like the results came in!” </p>



<p>“That was fast…” </p>



<p>“The analysis team guys are suuuper excellent y’see. Lemme see…ah, I see I see.” </p>



<p>“They figured something out?” </p>



<p>“Ah, it was a little complicated but just now I said [ah, I see] not [let’s dig your an*s] got it?” </p>



<p>“Nothing was complicated at all! I didn’t imagine anything like that!” </p>



<p> <br />“Meow haha, ‘kay I’ll stop messing around and tell you the real analysis results—Youtan, in math what happens when you multiply negative by negative?” <br /> <br />“Hm…it becomes positive right?” <br /> <br />“That’s right. So in other words, what happened earlier is, the misfortune of slipping on a banana peel and the crow’s beak stabbing your butt combined to turn into the diamond being vomited, see?” <br /> <br />“Huh…what kind of nonsensical talk is this…” <br /> <br />“The analysis team guys don’t really get the logic either seems like. Well, the [curse] is kind of a black box even for the heavenly realm…anyway, the gist is, if misfortune and the choices occur at close timing going forward, even if bad things happen from each, their combination can bring about a miraculous synergy resulting in happiness, ‘kay?” <br /> <br />Come to think of it, it was like that with the earlier fundoshi incident in class too…I thought it was suspiciously convenient but that was why huh… <br /> <br />“Oh…then from now on I’ve got nothing to fear from misfortune or the choices right!” <br /> <br />“Ah, well about that—” <br /> <br />Riiip! <br /> <br />Suddenly, there was a loud sound from my lower half. <br /> <br />“Th-The zipper is coming undone? Wh-Why? I haven’t put any weird force on it or anything…” <br /> <br />“Ah, probably got caught on something when you fell forward earlier?”  <br /> <br />Tch, misfortune…it’s open in the front despite the hole in back… <br /> <br />And this is secondary damage from slipping on the banana…the worst outcome of misfortune leading to more misfortune. <br /> <br />“Haah…gotta hurry and sew it up—” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose ] <br /> <br />① A crane I saved before turns into a cute girl and comes to return the favor <br /> <br />② A flock of crows comes to avenge their sniffed comrade<br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Hey! I never saved any crane! It’s effectively no choice!” <br /> <br />Yelling while reluctantly selecting 2— <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Caw caw caw caw caw. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The cries of countless birds suddenly resounded. <br /> <br />“Ugh…” <br /> <br />Looking up, the sky was filled with a massive flock of crows. <br /> <br />“Wh-What’s with these guys…they look kinda murderous no?” <br /> <br />“Yeah they’ve got a real bad vibe huh.”  <br /> <br />“Heh, but nothing to fear. After all, I’ve got approval from the heavenly analysis team!” <br /> <br />“Oh Youtan, about that—” <br /> <br />“Rather, I look forward to what plus will come about from my zipper being undone and the crows’ vengeance.” <br /> <br />“Uhh listen listen bro. According to an additional report from the analysis team, [The negative multiplication phenomenon rests upon an extremely unstable aura balance. Therefore, the conversion to a plus from the misfortune and curse combination isn’t fixed, but random.]” <br /> <br />“Huh…?” <br /> <br />In other words…there’s a case where it simply continues as consecutive minuses and ends like tha— </p>



<p>” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” Gogaaaaahhhh! ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ”</p>



<p>What flew at me like black bullets were the esteemed crows— <br /> <br />“Wahhh stop! Not there, not there! No, stop that! Hey, st-stop! I’m serious, sto— n-no, both front and back at once is too muchhhhhhhhh!”</p>
