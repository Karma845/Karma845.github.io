<h3>Interlude: Feelings I&#8217;ve noticed</h3>


				
<p>Even in her dreams, Yui was being hugged by Yuuma.</p>



<p>Her head felt fuzzy like she was half-awake. Being in a daze felt good as it is, she thought.</p>



<p>Moreover, Yuuma was hugging her now.</p>



<p>Warm. Burying her face in Yuuma&#8217;s chest, she felt somewhat relieved to hear his heartbeat.</p>



<p>Snuggling her head into Yuuma&#8217;s chest, she thought, 『I&#8217;m going to let him spoil me as much as possible』, innocently nudging him like a kitten.</p>



<p>──My precious, precious friend.</p>



<p>She liked him. She wanted to get even closer to him. She wanted to be with him forever. That was how important Yuuma was to her.</p>



<p>Raising her face. She saw Yuuma&#8217;s face before hers.</p>



<p>Yuuma narrowed his eyes and gently patted her on the head.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hee-hee…&#8221;</p>



<p>It felt good to have your head stroked, she thought.</p>



<p>Every time he did this, her head went light all at once.</p>



<p>──I really, really, really, really love him.</p>



<p>I love him, I want to close the distance between us, I want him to like me more. More, like me even more. Such were the thoughts in her head.</p>



<p>A fluffy good feeling. She loved Yuuma dearly and wanted to be with him forever and ever.</p>



<p>…Yuuma&#8217;s arms, which were holding Yui, became a little tighter. Then, Yuuma closed his eyes and brought his face closer to hers.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh…? Ah…&#8221;</p>



<p>Their lips overlapped. …It was a kiss.</p>



<p>The kiss lasted only for a moment. Yuuma quickly pulled his face away and made an apologetic expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;…S-Sorry. Did you not like it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No. I was just a little surprised, but I don&#8217;t mind?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was her true feelings. She was surprised when he kissed her out of the blue, but she didn&#8217;t mind at all if it was with Yuuma.</p>



<p>Far from it, in fact, her heart was pounding furiously. Happy feelings were overflowing out of her, and they couldn&#8217;t stop.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Hey, Yuuma?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, you know…?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui traced her fingers along the nape of Yuuma&#8217;s neck as she said this.</p>



<p>&#8220;C-Could you do that thing you did to me…one more time?&#8221;</p>



<p>Saying this, Yuuma smiled happily.</p>



<p>Yui closes her eyes with a pounding heart.</p>



<p>Then their lips meet again──.</p>



<p>────It was at this point that she woke up.</p>



<p>Opening her eyes, Yui found herself in Yuuma&#8217;s arms.</p>



<p>Confirming the situation. It took about ten seconds to realize that what just happened was a dream. And then──</p>



<p>&#8220;<del>~</del><del>~</del>~~~?!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui let out an inaudible scream of embarrassment.</p>



<p>Because she didn&#8217;t want to wake the sleeping Yuuma, she stayed still. Otherwise, she would have buried her face in the pillow and fainted in agony.</p>



<p>(W-W-Why did I have that kind of dream!? Eh!? Eh!? Why!? Really, why!?)</p>



<p>She was in a mild panic. She couldn&#8217;t believe that she had that kind of dream. Sure, she loved Yuma, but she shouldn&#8217;t have liked him that way.</p>



<p>…Despite this, she saw that kind of dream. A kiss in a dream made her heart pound furiously.</p>



<p>&#8220;U-Ugn….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuuma&#8217;s eyes opened thinly. Their eyes met.</p>



<p>&#8220;~~~!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui felt her face heat up. Her heart began to pound.</p>



<p>&#8220;A…h, un….a-ah…&#8221;</p>



<p>She couldn&#8217;t speak. She was so embarrassed that she couldn&#8217;t stop herself from looking left and right.</p>



<p>Yuuma, on the other hand, still seems to be sleepy. His eyes slowly closed again, and he began to breathe peacefully in his sleep.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yuuma…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…….&#8221;</p>



<p>She called out to him, but he didn&#8217;t wake up…….thank God, she thought.</p>



<p>Her heart was still pounding, and her face was still a deep red. If Yuuma had woken up, he might have noticed something.</p>



<p>It was when she relievedly stroked her chest.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hya!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuuma was still half asleep, but his arms were still strong enough to keep Yui in his hold. Their bodies were getting increasingly closer and closer to each other.</p>



<p>The strong body of a boy that she wasn&#8217;t aware of. A body temperature that was higher than even hers. Immediately, she became aware of him. She was worried that the sound of her heartbeat would wake Yuuma up.</p>



<p>She suddenly became embarrassed to be hugged by Yuuma, but even so. Although her chest was in agony, that agony included a little happiness.</p>



<p>I want to keep staying like this forever, she thought.</p>



<p>(W-Wow, so about Yuuma…I&#8217;m, right?)</p>



<p>Yuuma, I really, really love him.</p>



<p>If she was in trouble, she could count on him to rescue her. She enjoyed letting him spoil her. It was a lot of fun. She thought of him as a big brother that she could rely on.</p>



<p>But ever since a while ago, her heart was pounding furiously in her chest.</p>



<p>(Sleeping face, so cute……)</p>



<p>She gently reached out and touched his cheek.</p>



<p>Her head felt light and happy like she was in a dream.</p>



<p>While she was touching his cheeks, her thumbs touched Yuuma&#8217;s lips.</p>



<p>Soft.</p>



<p>(Kiss…I wish…)</p>



<p>She thought about that vaguely.</p>



<p>……………….</p>



<p>(…What did I just think!?)</p>



<p>She couldn&#8217;t believe what she was thinking. She just felt so happy and light when she saw Yuuma&#8217;s sleeping face. It was only after a while that she noticed that she wanted to kiss him like in the dream she had earlier…</p>



<p>Yui let out a slight puff, and buried her face in Yuuma&#8217;s chest. Her heart was pounding so hard that it was painful.</p>



<p>……The feeling of kissing him in the dream was still there.</p>



<p>She wanted to see the continuation of that dream, and she still wanted to kiss Yuuma even now.</p>



<p>(I see, I…)</p>



<p>She buried her face in Yuuma&#8217;s chest and hugged him tightly.</p>



<p>(I&#8217;ve found…someone I like…)</p>
