<h1>Chapter 5: Sauna, School Swimsuits, and Mysterious Letters</h1>


<p>“Now then, what should I do…”</p>

<p>The location is back at the headquarters of the Love Study Abroad – Roppongi Sky Tower.</p>
<p>I was tying a string around my wrist in front of my desk in my room.</p>

<p>Now that the two group dates are over, I have to choose two people and two destinations for the 1-on-1 dates.</p>
<p>The deadline to decide the partner for the individual 1-on-1 date is tomorrow morning.</p>
<p>By that time, I’m supposed to have arranged a phone call with Juujo-san through the internal line.</p>

<p>I’ll reorganize the status of each person once again.</p>
<p>Regarding the ‘additional dates,’ I accompanied YouTuber Yuu Shibuya on the Disney date, for the Nasu log-house date, it was my ex-girlfriend, Osaki Sumire, and with the former idol Ria Meguro, we managed to have a conversation that could be considered somewhat of an additional date.</p>
<p>With that said, actress Leona Kanda, my childhood friend Sakiho Shinagawa, and my stepsister Maion Hirakawa would be the candidates.</p>

<p>“Hmm…”</p>

<p>I’ve hit a dead end. Looking at the clock, it’s exactly 10 PM.</p>

<p>“…I should take a sauna.”</p>

<p>On the 64th floor of Roppongi Sky Tower, there’s a sauna [Remember, the steam bath is on the 64th floor] Juujo-san said with a straight expression.</p>
<p>It seems to be modeled after a sauna, just like in other hotels. There is a sauna, cold bath, shower, and a balcony for outdoor air bathing, but no hot tub.</p>
<p>Compared to other facilities, it gives the impression of being compact, but I found it more relaxing when using it alone.</p>
<p>I guess it means that ‘high quality’ is not always the same as ‘luxury’.</p>

<p>Of course, a sauna is a luxury in itself. I’ve never been to one at my own expense.</p>
<p>However, around this time last year, when I was doing a short-term job at a busy resort hotel during the peak season, my task was cleaning the baths.</p>
<p>I was allowed to use the sauna a few times, and I discovered the enjoyment in it.</p>
<p>So, when I learned there was a sauna in the Sky Tower, I was thrilled.</p>
<p>Since then, I’ve been going to the sauna exactly two hours after dinner every day. It seems like a good place to think.</p>
<p>I head to the common living area and take out a sports drink from the refrigerator.</p>
<p>There’s a refrigerator in each room, but this one is constantly stocked with a wide variety of drinks and snacks.</p>
<p>As I go down to the 64th floor and walk down the hallway——</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s Shinichi-kun.”</p>

<p>Ria Meguro, the former idol, waves her hand as she approaches from the opposite side.</p>
<p>The steam-reddened cheeks and damp hair from her bath are oddly enchanting.</p>
<p>‘Why does she seem more innocent than usual?’ While I was pondering this, she looked at me with a bashful smile.</p>

<p>“Don’t stare so much, it’s embarrassing since I’m not wearing any makeup.”</p>

<p>Seriously, is this what they mean by a natural beauty?</p>

<p>“Are you heading to the sauna?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes…”</p>

<p>While placing her hand on my arm, Ria speaks to me.</p>
<p>I, however, unintentionally show my virgin-level awkwardness and avert my gaze.</p>
<p>If things continue like this, she might tease me with something like, [Oh my, is the post-bath Rii a bit too stimulating for you? ♡] I thought. But then she said,</p>

<p>“If you had come just a bit earlier, we could have done the sauna session together. Rii already went in.”</p>

<p>She lets out a disappointed sigh. Sauna session?</p>

<p>“Ria, do you like saunas?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I got hooked on them recently…”</p>
<p>“Recently? When was that?”</p>
<p>“Um…”</p>

<p>Ria fidgets her lips a bit before confessing shyly.</p>

<p>“…After we got trapped in Disney.”</p>
<p>“Oh…”</p>

<p>Certainly, during that time, we were in a high-temperature room for a long period, got sprayed with sprinkler water, and then went outside——it was similar to the flow of sauna-water shower-and exposure to outdoor air.</p>

<p>“I just couldn’t forget how good it felt back then… When I looked it up in the library, it seemed like Rii really benefited from it…”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>

<p>Turning a mishap into an advantage, so to speak.</p>

<p>“Well, saunas are really something great, aren’t they?”</p>

<p>With her palms pressing against her cheeks in a dreamy manner, Ria’s expression felt much simpler and more like an ordinary girl than her usual mischievous impression.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, if I had gone to a co-ed school, maybe there would have been conversations like this during club training camps or school trips… I shake my head in my mind.</p>
<p>There probably aren’t girls this cute just anywhere, and even if there were, it’s unlikely I’d become close enough to chat with them after a bath. Even in an all-boys school, I’m a loner.</p>

<p>“Next time, will you join me in the sauna, Shinichi-kun?”</p>
<p>“Yes? What are you talking about? That’s impossible…”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not impossible? Shinichi is the only boy here, so if we use the boys’ bathroom, we’ll automatically get a private room for the two of us.”</p>

<p>That might be the case, but…</p>

<p>“If we did that, I’d get overheated quickly. That’s why I’m saying it’s not possible. Don’t underestimate a virgin.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, I see. Then how about when you’re not a virgin anymore, can we go in together?”</p>
<p>“What’s that…”</p>
<p>“Hahaha.”</p>

<p>Seeing that slightly sly smile, my words come out involuntarily.</p>

<p>“Ria, compared to usual, now you’re actually more…”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“…never mind. Well then.”</p>

<p>…Wait, what was I about to say just now…</p>
<p>Shaking off those stray thoughts, I quickly headed to the men’s changing room.</p>
<p>After undressing in the changing room, washing up in the shower area, and wrapping a bath towel around my waist, I finally entered the sauna room.</p>

<p>“Hey, Hirakawa, I’ve been waiting for you.”</p>
<p>“…Excuse me, I made a mistake.”</p>

<p>There, I saw a current female high school student actress wearing a school swimsuit, so I made a swift turn.</p>
<p>What? Did I accidentally wander into the women’s bath?</p>

<p>“Just a moment, wait!”</p>

<p>I feel an arm grabbing me from behind, but I keep moving forward with tension.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“This is the men’s sauna, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, this is the men’s sauna.”</p>

<div><img src="https://animestuff.me/img/0011_m10.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>“What are you doing? If the roles were reversed between men and women, it would be a problem! No, even without the gender reversal, it’s still a problem!”</p>
<p>“Oh, Hirakawa, you’re talking too fast. But here, it’s just you, isn’t it okay?”</p>

<p>Kanda remains calm and smiles at her own pace.</p>

<p>“Why are you here? Why are you wearing a school swimsuit? You shouldn’t do this to a virgin!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, why are you suddenly exposing your sexual experience and getting all self-deprecating?”</p>
<p>“That’s not the point!”</p>
<p>“About the school swimsuit? I thought maybe the all-boys school Hirakawa would like it.”</p>
<p>“I did ask that question, but that’s not the point of the question!”</p>

<p>Also, I personally don’t like school swimsuits as much as jerseys! The reason is that it’s too graphic!</p>

<p>“Just kidding, just kidding. I just came to tell you, ‘Don’t choose me for the date.’ “</p>

<p>Upon hearing those words, I stopped in my tracks.</p>

<p>“Huh? What did you say?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? You’re acting like a dense protagonist from a light novel. Didn’t you hear me?”</p>

<p>When I turn around, Kanda tilts her head.</p>

<p>“…I heard you, but I’m asking about the meaning behind those words.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, since we need to talk properly, let’s just get in the sauna for now. But still, hasn’t anything like this happened since the study abroad began?”</p>

<p>Kanda and I sit on the sauna’s middle step with one space between us, forming a sort of staircase arrangement.</p>
<p>Looking at the scene of a swimsuit-clad beauty in a sauna, it’s such a niche sight that it’s beyond enticing, it was downright astonishing.</p>

<p>“…by ‘this,’ you mean someone intruding into the men’s sauna?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. After all, everyone knows that it’s reserved for Hirakawa. Like Shinagawa, for instance. Isn’t she a stalker?”</p>

<p>I wish she wouldn’t say things like ‘Isn’t she a stalker?’ so casually…</p>

<p>“Sakiho doesn’t try to see me naked.”</p>
<p>“Huh, why not?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know…”</p>

<p>Previously, when I asked, ‘You wouldn’t have set up surveillance cameras in the baths, right?’ she blushed and shyly said, ‘For that, I’m saving it for the time when we’re in a relationship and I can openly look at you.’</p>
<p>I can’t say such a thing from my side, though.</p>

<p>“Oh, really? That’s surprising. Shinagawa, she’s more innocent than I thought.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say anything?”</p>
<p>“It’s written all over your face.”</p>
<p>“I don’t have such a complicated expression…”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, you’re interesting.”</p>

<p>Kanda’s insight or observation skills are just too keen, but for me, it’s really not amusing—</p>

<p>“…So, what do you mean by ‘don’t choose me’? Did you become fed up with the study abroad?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that. I want to marry Hirakawa.”</p>
<p>“Then, why?”</p>

<p>Slightly taken aback by her straightforward words, I ask again.</p>

<p>“In the 1-on-1 dates, you can only choose two people, right? But within Hirakawa’s choices, there are three including me. Isn’t that the case?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah.”</p>

<p>This is something one could expect even without Kanda saying it.</p>
<p>In the dressing room of Disney, there were opportunities to talk 1-on-1 with Ria. With Yuu, it was during the additional date of Disney. And with Osaki, it was during the additional date in Nasu.</p>
<p>Comparing those experiences, there hasn’t been a chance to have a thorough conversation with Sakiho, Maion, and Kanda – the three of them since I join this program.</p>

<p>“And I’m the most likely candidate, I guess? Because this is our first meeting.”</p>
<p>“That’s correct. So why?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>

<p>After showing a slight contemplative gesture, Kanda smiles with curved eyebrows.</p>

<p>“Maybe because I don’t want you to regret choosing me. If I can eliminate myself as an option, it’ll reduce one source of regret for you. So, it’s not ‘I’m not good enough for you,’ but ‘Don’t choose me.’ “</p>
<p>“Hmm…?”</p>

<p>In an attempt to unveil her lie, I fix my gaze on her.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, you’re staring at me like that? Hirakawa, when it’s just the two of us, you tend to become quite bold, don’t you?”</p>
<p>“N-No…”</p>

<p>Surprised by the proximity that was closer than I realized, I instinctively tried to move away a bit. At that moment,</p>

<p>“No one will find out, and I won’t tell anyone.”</p>

<p>She grabs – no, pulls – my arm, detaining me.</p>

<p>“Kanda…?”</p>
<p>“This study abroad is strange, isn’t it? You, Hirakawa, have to make a promise of marriage even to someone you’re not yet in a romantic relationship with. As for me, I haven’t even become friends with you, Hirakawa.”</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I found myself in a position where Kanda had me pressed against the sauna step, like some kind of ‘(Kabe don) wall don ‘ or rather, a ‘floor don.’</p>

<p>“But on the other hand, it means that we have to do lover-like things for this study abroad. When you think about it that way, even if Hirakawa suddenly tried to do something ‘bold’ in one leap, no one could blame you. That’s why…”</p>

<p>My heart beats rapidly. My throat is dry.</p>
<p>Whether it’s the effect of the sauna or because of the fine skin and fragrance before me, my head starts to spin.</p>
<p>Just as that sensation kicks in, Kanda’s alluring lips utter something dazzlingly soft.</p>

<p>“…It’s okay, Hirakawa.”</p>
<p>“Yahooo! Rii makes a triumphant return! ♡ Wait, huhhhh? Shinichi-kunnnn!?”</p>

<p>Simultaneously, a brilliantly playful voice burst into the sauna, so bright it almost felt blinding.</p>

<p>“Ri, Ria!?”</p>
<p>“Meguro…!”</p>
<p>“Wait a second! What are you two doing here together? I thought I’d surprise Shinichi-kun, since he was all alone!”</p>
<p>“No, Ria, listen. It’s not what you think. This is not what it seems…”</p>

<p>I recognized these words. This is the ultimate cliché line of a cheater.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess I’m just the convenient fling partner.”</p>

<p>Kanda calmly continues her analysis of the situation as composed as ever, even in a school swimsuit in the sauna.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“What are you talking about? Shinichi-kun, Rii is mad at you! You never actually made a move on Rii, yet you’re acting like this… Ouch!”</p>

<p>“Are you okay!?”</p>



<p>Ria, caught up in her anger, had neglected her footing and stumbled and fell while approaching us.</p>



<p>“Ouch…It hurts!”</p>

<p>“What are you doing, be careful, Ria…”</p>



<p>With teary eyes and her towel slipping in all the commotion, Ria is frantically rubbing her ankles.</p>

<p>Instinctively, I close my eyes. Nevertheless…</p>



<p>“…I’m saved.”</p>



<p>It feels like both Kanda and I said that simultaneously as if we were both momentarily dazzled by the situation.</p>

<p>For the time being, I lead Ria out to the changing area.</p>



<p>I changed my clothes in one of the restroom cubicles; Kanda and Ria were changing in the changing area.</p>

<p>It’s slightly hard to accept that, even though this is the men’s section, I’m the one being isolated.</p>

<p>When I return to the changing area, I see Ria in pajamas, and she’s sitting in a chair, holding her reddened ankle.</p>



<p>“Are you okay?”</p>

<p>“Yeah… Shinichi-kun, can you give me a piggyback ride… I can’t walk…”</p>

<p>“Well… I’ll lend you my shoulder, but a piggyback is a bit much…”</p>

<p>“Puu… Rii is the same age as Maion, yet Shinichi-kun only spoils Maion all the time… ! Even Rii wants an Onīchan…!”</p>

<p>“It’s not like I’ve ever spoiled Maion…”</p>



<p>Or rather, it might be more accurate to say, ‘She has never been indulged.’</p>



<p>“Hey, Kanda…”</p>

<p>“I don’t know, can’t you figure it out yourself?”</p>



<p>When I looked up at Kanda seeking help, for some reason, a curt attitude was returned.</p>



<p>“Why are you suddenly getting angry?”</p>

<p>“That…”</p>



<p>Kanda pointed at my clothes.</p>



<p>“That sweatshirt, you got it from Shibuya, right?”</p>

<p>“Oh… yes, why?”</p>



<p>So? When I looked puzzled, Kanda puffed out her cheeks a bit.</p>



<p>“Wearing a present you got from another girl in front of me, how does that sit with you?”</p>

<p>“No, I didn’t know Kanda was here. Besides, it’s mine to begin with.”</p>



<p>As I answered, she clears her throat. ‘Mmm.’</p>



<p>“Hirakawa, you’re lacking delicacy…”</p>



<p>Huh?</p>

<p>Her expression inadvertently seemed as if she was truly jealous, and I reminded myself once again that she was one of the top actresses.</p>

<p>This is acting, this is only acting.</p>



<p>“Hey, don’t leave Rii alone! ”</p>



<p>Eventually, I gave Ria a piggyback ride to her room and returned to the living room.</p>



<p>“Hirakawa-kun…”</p>

<p>“Onīchan…!”</p>

<p>“Getting involved with another woman again…”</p>



<p>Osaki, Maion, and Sakiho reacted one after another.</p>

<p>Sakiho is glaring at me intensely.</p>

<p>Ever since we returned from Nasu, she seems to be in a bad mood…</p>



<p>Even though there are sofas around the living room coffee table, everyone is standing for some reason. Osaki and Maion had somewhat frightened and troubled expressions.</p>

<p>Amidst this, Yuu was filming the tabletop with one hand and beckoning me with the other.</p>



<p>“Shin, look at this for a moment! By the way, that sweatshirt, isn’t that the one I gave you? Do you like it?”</p>

<p>“I see, Shibuya is pleased.”</p>



<p>Ignoring Kanda’s jealous acting that never seems to stop, I look at the tabletop.</p>

<p>There, on a sheet of copy paper, are pasted newspaper cut-out letters, forming a so-called cryptic message.</p>

<p>The words pasted there say:</p>



<p>『There is a cheater among you.』</p>



<p>“What’s this…?”</p>

<p>“Seems like an accusation letter.”</p>



<p>Kanda, wearing a detective-like expression, peers at it thoughtfully.</p>

<p>Though the intention is to prevent handwriting analysis, actually seeing such a cryptic message that you’d only expect from crime drama confession notes sends shivers down my spine.</p>



<p>“Kanda, aren’t you scared by this sort of thing?”</p>

<p>“Huh? Not at all. I’ve seen things like this during drama shoots.”</p>



<p>Yes, well, that Haunted Palace was all just acting. That was scarier.</p>



<p>“So, who found it?”</p>

<p>“Maion did. It was there when she came to the living room about 20 minutes ago.”</p>



<p>When I asked, Maion raised her hand right away.</p>

<p>Normally, the first person to discover something like this is the first to be suspected, but whether she knows that or not——</p>



<p>“It wasn’t there when I came for a drink before going to the sauna, so it must have been left after I went to the sauna.”</p>

<p>“Could someone among us have placed it?”</p>

<p>“It could be Juujo-san too, right?”</p>

<p>“If we include the staff who replenish drinks, the possibilities increase, but… I can’t understand the motive behind doing something like this.”</p>



<p>Yuu, Kanda, and Osaki tilt their heads one after another.</p>



<p>“Can I borrow this for a moment?”</p>



<p>For now, I decided to take the cryptic message and return to my room.</p>

<p>In addition to having to consider my 1-on-1 date partner, now there were two more things on my mind.</p>



<p>One is the ‘author of the cryptic message.’ Who created it and left it in the living room?</p>

<p>The other is, who exactly is the ‘person who is cheating’ indicated by this cryptic message?</p>



<p>In the normal course of thought, the most likely candidates for the ‘person who is cheating’ would be Yuu and Osaki, considering they both already obtained additional dates.</p>

<p>If that’s the case, it could be deduced that the ‘author of the cryptic message’ is one of the remaining four.</p>

<p>It wouldn’t make sense for the ‘person who is cheating’ to falsely accuse themselves through such a note, especially since Kanda and Ria have alibis.</p>

<p>Specifically, Ria doesn’t have an alibi for the few minutes between meeting on the 64th-floor corridor and entering the men’s sauna.</p>

<p>However, the time window seems too tight for her to go to the living room, leave the note, and return.</p>

<p>So, the suspicious candidates for the ‘author of the cryptic message’ are Sakiho, Maion, and someone from the management side, including Juujo-san.</p>

<p>But considering the timing of sliding this cryptic message in and reflecting on everyone’s actions so far——</p>



<p>***</p>



<p>The next morning.</p>

<p>I knock on Juujo-san’s door.</p>



<p>“Shinichi-sama… Is there something you need to discuss directly?”</p>

<p>“The partner for my first 1-on-1 date has been decided.”</p>

<p>“I see. Please, do tell me.”</p>

<p>“Yes, the first date will be with——”</p>
