<h2>Chapter 5: Stand-in Boyfriend</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>“Aria! What on earth were you thinking? Why would you tell Sena-san about this!”</p>



<p>We arrived at the tea ceremony clubroom. As soon as the sliding door clicked shut, Kanzaki-sensei erupted.</p>



<p>A beautiful teacher who was typical of Yamato Nadeshiko<sup data-fn="4b4948fa-bd55-49a8-aa00-6f3adae6b34e" class="fn"><a href="#4b4948fa-bd55-49a8-aa00-6f3adae6b34e" id="4b4948fa-bd55-49a8-aa00-6f3adae6b34e-link">1</a></sup> looked different today.</p>



<p>Her silky, flowing black hair stood on end, her fair complexion flushed crimson, and her large eyes narrowed into angry triangles. She raised her voice to a level rivaling the lecture she gave me after I declared my relationship.</p>



<p>In other words, Kanzaki-sensei’s arranged marriage turned out to be true. My intuition about her unusual behavior in the classroom was spot on.</p>



<p>“But you’re facing a once-in-a-lifetime crisis! Since you consulted me about it, I can’t stand by and let you be forced into a marriage you don’t want.”</p>



<p>Aria-san replied coolly, despite Kanzaki-sensei’s anger. She sat cross-legged on the tatami mats as though she were tired of being lectured. This woman really was something else.</p>



<p>“This is a private matter! Sena-san has nothing to do with it!” Kanzaki-sensei, genuinely furious, wore her emotions plain for us to see. Aria-san had stripped away the teacher’s mask, revealing the individual Kanzaki Shizuru who was seething with anger.</p>



<p>“That’s not true. Sumi-kun is your savior, after all.”</p>



<p>“Sumi-kun? You address him like you’re close. Do you two know each other?” Kanzaki-sensei stared at both me and Aria-san in turn.</p>



<p>“When I was a freshman in college, I worked as a cram school tutor. Sumi-kun was one of my students.”</p>



<p>“…So then, Sena-san knew Aria before Arisaka-san?”</p>



<p>“Well, in terms of chronology, yes.” After I confirmed, Kanzaki-sensei’s expression darkened even further.</p>



<p>“Just like you and Sumi-kun, we’re also a close pair of teacher and student. Right, Sumi-kun?” She pulled me by the arm and I seated next to her.</p>



<p>“Aria… why do you always bring up these unexpected situations out of nowhere?”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei pressed her temples with her slender fingers. Aria-san probably hadn’t changed since her student days.</p>



<p>“You have no right to complain, Shizuru-chan. After all, it was your words that prompted me to work as a cram school tutor. You could say you’re a bit like Cupid.” Aria-san said something unexpectedly terrifying. </p>



<p>If Kanzaki-sensei hadn’t said those words, Aria-san wouldn’t have become a cram school tutor. If that hadn’t happened, I wouldn’t have passed the entrance exam to Eisei High and then I wouldn’t have started dating Yorka.</p>



<p>The gears of human relationships, driven by luck and fate, were truly unpredictable.</p>



<p>“Cupid, huh?” Kanzaki-sensei glanced at me and settled into a proper sitting position. Her posture remained impeccable as ever.</p>



<p>“What kind of person is Sena-san to have connections with both the Arisaka sisters?”</p>



<p>“Exactly. Sumi-kun’s quite the ladies’ man!”</p>



<p>Before Aria-san could derail the conversation, I needed to confirm why I was brought here.</p>



<p>“Let me get this straight. Kanzaki-sensei has an arranged marriage proposal, and if she accepts, she’ll quit teaching. Aria-san called me here to stop that. Is that correct?” I asked cautiously.</p>



<p>“Exactly.” </p>



<p>“Not at all.”</p>



<p>Their opposite responses left me completely bewildered.</p>



<p>“Isn’t it simple? Shizuru-chan doesn’t want to quit teaching, right?”</p>



<p>“Of course not. There’s no reason for me to rush into marriage right now, and I have no intention of quitting teaching either.”</p>



<p>“Did you tell that to your parents and cancel the arranged marriage?”</p>



<p>“Um, that’s…”</p>



<p>Aria-san threw the question teasingly, and Kanzaki-sensei hesitated to answer. It was the first time I had seen her so flustered.</p>



<p>“Are Kanzaki-sensei’s parents really that strict?”</p>



<p>“Shizuru-chan’s mom is a renowned tea ceremony master. She’s been strict about etiquette and manners since childhood, and their family is quite traditional. Shizuru-chan, being the epitome of a lady, was expected to marry right after graduating from university without pursuing a career.”</p>



<p>Aria-san shrugged, as though saying, <em>“Hard to believe nowadays, right?”</em></p>



<p>“But Sensei, you’re teaching now, aren’t you?”</p>



<p>“There was quite a fuss when I decided to become a teacher,” Kanzaki-sensei sighed deeply.</p>



<p>“Are your parents pushing forward with this arranged marriage because they’re worried for their daughter?”</p>



<p>“Oh, Sumi-kun catches on fast. That’s a relief.”</p>



<p>“Why exactly do you need me then? I finally arrived at the crux of the matter. What role could a mere high school boy play when Kanzaki-sensei’s parents seemed unyielding?</p>



<p>“Shizuru-chan wants to continue teaching, but she has no plans to marry anytime soon. Her parents, on the other hand, are adamant about her getting married.” Aria-san confidently revealed the heart of her plan. “That’s why if Shizuru-chan introduces a boyfriend, it’ll put her parents at ease and they’ll call off the arranged marriage. Simple, right?”</p>



<p>“But I don’t have a boyfriend so that plan won’t work,” Kanzaki-sensei immediately shot down the idea.</p>



<p>“Wait a minute. Are you suggesting…” Meanwhile, I realized what Aria-san was getting at.</p>



<p>“As expected of Sumi-kun. Your keen intuition is why I chose you!” Aria-san’s lips curved into a crescent moon smile. I wasn’t here to offer support or assistance. I was here to be front and center in this plan!</p>



<p>“Let’s make Sumi-kun pretend to be Shizuru-chan’s boyfriend and introduce him to her parents!”</p>



<p>“No way!” </p>



<p>“Absolutely not!”</p>



<p>Both Kanzaki-sensei and I immediately rejected the idea.</p>



<p>“You two are a perfect match! Come on, Sumi-kun can pull it off for sure!” Aria-san confidently raised her thumb.</p>



<p>“I’ve supported you plenty of times before, but this time is out of the question. Having a stand-in boyfriend is completely absurd! And to involve Sena-san in this? He’s my student for god sake!”</p>



<p>“Exactly! It’s completely unreasonable!” I naturally opposed it as well.</p>



<p>“Don’t overthink it. Just meet Shizuru-chan’s parents and act as her boyfriend, that’s all.”</p>



<p>“That’s an incredibly high hurdle!”</p>



<p>How could posing as a boyfriend in front of my homeroom teacher’s parents be considered a simple task?</p>



<p>“For one, I’m not comfortable deceiving my parents.”</p>



<p>Given Kanzaki-sensei’s serious nature, her sentiment was understandable.</p>



<p>“You’ve already tried to convince them countless times, but it’s no use. While it’s nice that your parents are worried about you, you’re the one who should decide your own life. You’re already a teacher, a respectable adult, Shizuru-chan.”</p>



<p>“But…”</p>



<p>“You don’t have enough time to be picky. Even if you cry and beg, they’re not the type to be swayed. It’ll be a straight path to the altar if you go through with the arranged marriage. Is that really what you want?” Aria-san’s words were calm but piercing. Kanzaki-sensei looked pained, unable to offer a rebuttal.</p>



<p>“What matters most is action, not just words. And if you get caught in the worst scenario, it’s not like you’ll be killed. But if you stay silent, you’ll end up truly getting married.” Aria-san understood the recklessness of the plan, yet she still insisted on pushing forward with the proposal.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry to Kanzaki-sensei, and I get where you’re coming from with that stand-in boyfriend idea. But having me, a high schooler, play that role? That’s just plain reckless no matter how you spin it.” I argued with common sense.</p>



<p>“Exactly! He’s still a kid. It’s obvious to anyone.”</p>



<p>“No problem, let’s just push through with the scenario of a pure love story between an older woman and a younger guy.”</p>



<p>“My social standing will be in jeopardy if I get caught!”</p>



<p>“Shizuru-chan, nothing ventured, nothing gained, right?”</p>



<p>“And that’s exactly why having a kid involved is the worst part!”</p>



<p>The opposing Kanzaki-sensei looked cornered, she was on the verge of tears.</p>



<p>“Aria-san, wouldn’t it be more practical to find someone older around your university? It would reduce the risk of failure significantly.”</p>



<p>Aria-san, being a college student, surely had plenty of guys over twenty around her. Choosing someone experienced with women as a stand-in boyfriend seemed far more realistic to me.</p>



<p>“No way, Sumi-kun is the only one who can protect Shizuru-chan.”</p>



<p>“—A normal sister wouldn’t ask her little sister’s boyfriend to be a stand-in lover of their homeroom’s teacher.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei nodded deeply at my sensible rebuttal.</p>



<p>“It’s pointless to challenge someone who won’t listen to reason. We don’t even need to convince her parents. We just need to make them give up. And for that, we need to try an unexpected approach.”</p>



<p><em>No, I don’t understand at all.</em></p>



<p>“Seriously though, a mere guy won’t be enough to convince Shizuru-chan’s parents. They’ll see right through it and failure is almost guaranteed.”</p>



<p>“…So, what specific qualities do you expect from a stand-in boyfriend?”</p>



<p>I was getting tired of trying to convince her even before dealing with the parents. When I asked, Aria-san held up three fingers with a determined look.</p>



<p>“The stand-in boyfriend must meet three conditions. Firstly, he won’t genuinely fall for Shizuru-chan. The ideal candidate should already have a partner and remain faithful. Secondly, he must have the wit and courage to handle tough situations with quick thinking. And thirdly, he could fit in seamlessly when standing next to Shizuru-chan.”</p>



<p>“I only meet the first condition. The second one is a stretch, and the third? It’s a total miss.”</p>



<p>“That’s not true.”</p>



<p>“Do you really think this plan will succeed with me as the stand-in boyfriend?”</p>



<p>I felt like Aria-san was trying to lower the success rate of the plan by making me the stand-in boyfriend. But at the same time, I sensed a glimmer of opportunity that only she could see.</p>



<p>“I know it’s a tall order, but Sumi-kun can definitely pull it off.”</p>



<p>“…..”</p>



<p>This was the terrifying aspect of Arisaka Aria. When you listened to her words, you would inexplicably think that you could do it. You’d fall under her spell.</p>



<p>“Aria. No matter what you say, it’s not happening. I can’t inconvenience Sena-san like that.”</p>



<p>“You’re too soft. Your students genuinely like you, Shizuru-chan.”</p>



<p>For the first time, Aria-san showed a serious expression.</p>



<p>“I won’t claim my plan is perfect, but I think it’s the best approach.”</p>



<p>Aria-san confidently declared just like before.</p>



<p>This was an old story. When I told my middle school homeroom teacher that my first choice high school was Eisei High, they smiled and said, “<em>It’s impossible, so just settle for somewhere safe</em>.” Of course, given my poor grades at the time, it seemed like an impossible dream.</p>



<p>When I said the same thing to Aria-san the moment I joined the cram school, she burst out laughing but she never once said it was impossible.</p>



<p>Aria-san respected my challenge and saw potential in me.</p>



<p>There were no guarantees of success. Ultimately, it would come down to the abilities of <em>Sena Kisumi</em>. I wanted to challenge myself and be satisfied with the results.</p>



<p>Arisaka Aria was the first person to believe that.</p>



<p>That’s why if she was confident, I was willing to go along with this crazy plan.</p>



<p>Was it a reckless plan by the Dreadful Demon Queen, or a daring scheme only a great leader could see through?</p>



<p>Even if I couldn’t make that judgment now, I trusted Arisaka Aria enough to bet on it.</p>



<p>“Aria-san, are you sure I’m the right fit for this?”</p>



<p>“Absolutely. You’re the only one who fits the bill, being both her student and my sister’s boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“Your request is borderline insane.”</p>



<p>“But with you, we can pull off the impossible. Just like before. I believe that.”</p>



<p>With such unwavering confidence, it was understandable why Yorka would admire her. Aria-san was just too radiant. Her words were like the sunrise, dispelling dark emotions like anxiety, despair, and sadness with a single ray of light.</p>



<p>“…For me, seeing Yorka smile is what matters most. I always want to protect her, but I’m aware that I’m still just a kid. In that regard, there’s no one else but Kanzaki-sensei who can fill that role.”</p>



<p>“I couldn’t agree more. There’s no teacher as dependable as Shizuru-chan.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei had always watched over Yorka.</p>



<p>Even if she was treated as an archenemy and disliked, she cared for Yorka and didn’t hesitate to lend a hand when needed. Because she had the art prep room prepared for Yorka and appointed me as class representative, we were able to become a happy couple.</p>



<p>Everything was thanks to Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>Could I just stand by and ignore her when she was in trouble? Would I be satisfied with my happiness alone?</p>



<p>If it was about repaying kindness, I should do it before graduation. Right now, if Kanzaki Shizuru needed help as an individual, I wanted to be there for her.</p>



<p>With Aria-san’s support and my determination, we could definitely overcome this as well.</p>



<p>That’s the reason why <em>Sena Kisumi</em> was brought here.</p>



<p>“…I’ll do it. I’ll be Sensei’s stand-in boyfriend.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>After I agreed to be a stand-in boyfriend, Aria-san squeezed my hands with joy.</p>



<p>“Thank you, Sumi-kun. I love you. Let’s do our best to protect Shizuru-chan’s single status!”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to love me, just increase the success rate of the plan, please.”</p>



<p>“I get it. I’ll give it my all to live up to your cooperation! Shall we exchange contact information?”</p>



<p>With the deal sealed, Aria-san who was in high spirits pulled out her smartphone.</p>



<p>“I feel a bit awkward exchanging contact info with my girlfriend’s sister.”</p>



<p>“It’s fine. Regular communication is a crucial key to the plan’s success.”</p>



<p>Reluctantly, I registered Aria-san’s contact information.</p>



<p>“By the way, I rarely exchange contact information with guys. You’re lucky ~”</p>



<p>“It must be tough being popular,” I replied nonchalantly.</p>



<p>“Show a little more enthusiasm.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei, who seemed to have been lost in thought, finally broke her silence and spoke with a heavy tone. “I still can’t agree. It’s one thing to involve Aria, but bringing my current student into this…”</p>



<p>“Don’t beat around the bush, Shizuru-chan. If you have something to say, say it here and now. I’ll listen.” Aria-san’s tone grew slightly stronger.</p>



<p>With just that, the atmosphere in the tea room became noticeably heavier. This person’s commanding presence in the room was just as strong as Kanzaki-sensei’s.</p>



<p>I suddenly felt thirsty, but Kanzaki-sensei didn’t offer tea which was unusual. It was clear she wasn’t feeling relaxed herself.</p>



<p>“I never expected Sena-san to agree…”</p>



<p>“Is that surprising?”</p>



<p>“Why didn’t you refuse?”</p>



<p>Aria-san remained silent, just listening to the conversation between me and Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>Gone was the dignity that Kanzaki-sensei displayed in front of the class. She didn’t have that imposing air of a teacher; she was just a real woman, struggling with major life decisions like marriage and career. A dilemma that adults and children alike shared.</p>



<p>“It’s because I trust Dreadful Demon Queen’s track record. Because I listened to this person before, I got into this school.” I glanced at Aria-san. “She’s got this uncanny intuition and a knack for coming up with solid ideas. She always seems to pull it off when it counts. Didn’t Sensei discuss this with her beforehand?” I kept my tone light, trying not to make the whole stand-in boyfriend thing too serious or else it’d get awkward.</p>



<p>“But still, as a teacher, it’s not quite right for me to ask my student to play the role of, um, a stand-in boyfriend…” Kanzaki-sensei still hesitated to cross the boundary between teacher and student.</p>



<p>“This is a special case for me too.”</p>



<p>“Is it for Arisaka-san? Then—”</p>



<p>I cut off her words and expressed my own feelings first. “I know you want to continue teaching, Sensei. Teaching is your calling. It’d be a huge loss for the other students too if we lose such an excellent teacher.”</p>



<p>“There’s no reason for you to go this far for my personal circumstances.”</p>



<p>“Kanzaki-sensei. You said it yourself when you appointed me as class representative. You told me to be the bridge.”</p>



<p>“That was a matter between students.”</p>



<p>I shook my head. “It’s the same thing. It’s best for us if you stay as our homeroom teacher until the end. As class rep, I’ll make sure to fulfill my role as that bridge.”</p>



<p>I think my reasoning was a bit forced, but I trusted her, and I wanted to learn from her until graduation. “Just keep giving me impossible tasks as usual, Sensei. And then, I’ll grumble about it but manage to pull through somehow. That’s my job as class rep. Besides, did I ever refuse when you called me to this tea room?”</p>



<p>“Just this once, I’d like you to refuse.”</p>



<p>“What would you do if the roles were reversed?”</p>



<p>“…I’d tell you to do it.”</p>



<p>“Just do it.”</p>



<p>“I can’t.”</p>



<p>“Come on, do it.”</p>



<p>“I don’t want to.”</p>



<p>“Do it, please!”</p>



<p>“Give me a break!”</p>


<div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1000010767.png" alt="" /></div>


<p>Kanzaki-sensei completely threw away her teacher’s dignity and adamantly refused.</p>



<p>“Come on, Sensei. Show the students your good side.”</p>



<p>“I can’t accept a logic that’s like forcing people to drink at a dinner party!”</p>



<p>“You’ve got terrible timing to be so stubborn.”</p>



<p>“I-I’m exposing myself in such a humiliating manner to you, and now, to have you meet my parents as a stand-in boyfriend is just too much…”</p>



<p>“But it’s all just an act.”</p>



<p>“You don’t know how terrifying my mother is, it’s easy for you to say,” Sensei confessed with a troubled expression.</p>



<p>“Terrifying, huh? What’s your mother like?”</p>



<p>“She’s like a strict demon. I respect her, but I’m really not good at dealing with her. Whenever I see her, I get so nervous I can’t even speak.”</p>



<p>“So Sensei has weaknesses too.”</p>



<p>“I’m a human, after all.”</p>



<p>It was surprising to hear that Kanzaki-sensei’s weakness was her own mother.</p>



<p>“You can see this as an opportunity to overcome your weakness. Trying this challenge might change your relationship for the better.”</p>



<p>“I’m already an adult. Things don’t change easily at my age.”</p>



<p>That was a pretty pessimistic outlook. If she kept this mentality, it’d start affecting her work too.</p>



<p>I continued to encourage her without giving up. “But you went to Aria-san for advice because you didn’t want to go through with the arranged marriage, right?”</p>



<p>“Aria knows my parents too. Based on that, I expected her to come up with a groundbreaking idea. But to involve Sena-san is too reckless.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t being reckless just her usual style?”</p>



<p>“Even so, my parents will definitely see through the plan!”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei sat in seiza<sup data-fn="decfe922-4d41-47ee-8e9d-7c0e89d08fe0" class="fn"><a href="#decfe922-4d41-47ee-8e9d-7c0e89d08fe0" id="decfe922-4d41-47ee-8e9d-7c0e89d08fe0-link">1</a></sup>, her hands trembling. <em>Is she afraid?</em></p>



<p>Her imagination leaned too far into the negative and left no room for positivity.</p>



<p>“Why does it matter?” I said with a resigned tone.</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“I mean, you’ve been clear about not wanting this from the start. And yet, you’re being pushed into it.”</p>



<p>“Correct.”</p>



<p>“Your parents are worried about their daughter, that’s why there’s an arranged marriage talk. It’s actually a relief if they find out. They would see how serious you are about disliking it, enough to appoint a stand-in boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“But to make my mother change her mind…”</p>



<p>“Sensei, you’ve always been the type to not rebel against your parents, right?”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>“Is appointing a stand-in boyfriend the boldest thing you’ve ever done in your life?”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>“Then they’ll definitely be surprised. They won’t expect their quiet daughter to do something this bold. That alone will have enough impact.”</p>



<p>The mention of impact changed Kanzaki-sensei’s expression.</p>



<p>“Sensei, unexpected moves like this only work the first time. If you’re going to try a wild surprise that your parents won’t expect, now’s the time.” I stared into her eyes.</p>



<p>“But…”</p>



<p>“It’ll be fine. I’ll be by your side on the day. I’ll support you as much as you need. You won’t have to face it alone.”</p>



<p>“Sena-san…”</p>



<p>“It’s okay to rebel a little late. And if we get scolded, I’ll apologize alongside you.” I instigated a teacher to do things that would get us scolded. I was really an outrageous student.</p>



<p>But now, our relationship wasn’t just between a student and teacher.</p>



<p>When rumor circulated about Yorka’s morning return in April, Kanzaki-sensei worked hard to quell the gossip around school. Now, it was my turn to go all out and disrupt this arranged marriage proposal.</p>



<p>That’s the trust we had built up between a student and a teacher.</p>



<p>The uncertainty faded from Kanzaki Shizuru’s eyes, and her usual composed expression returned.</p>



<p>“Sena-san, won’t you regret this?”</p>



<p>“Is it too late for me to decline now?” I played dumb for a moment.</p>



<p>“No, you can’t. Allow me to ask from my end, then. Sena Kisumi-san, please lend me your strength.”</p>



<p>“I’ll do my best.”</p>



<p>Just as teachers helped students, sometimes it was okay for students to help teachers too.</p>



<p>Aria-san nodded contentedly beside me.</p>



<p>“Now that everything’s settled, let’s reconvene for a strategy meeting once we have more details. Alright, let’s call it a day.”</p>



<p>Aria-San stood up.</p>



<p>“Um, Sena-san. I know it’s not my place to say, but are you sure Arisaka-san will be okay?”</p>



<p>For a moment, I was caught off guard.</p>



<p>“Huh!?”</p>



<p>The impact of being Kanzaki-sensei’s stand-in boyfriend was so strong that I completely forgot about the need to convince Yorka herself.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>“Nice reverse counseling. You really know how to play your cards,” Aria-san said as soon as we left the tea room. She was running her hand through my hair like she was petting a dog.</p>



<p>“I was your chosen persuader from the start, huh?”</p>



<p>Aria-san had intended for me to do the convincing all along. Evidence of this was clear; after I agreed to be the stand-in boyfriend, she stayed mostly silent, only saying, ‘<em>I’ll listen properly’</em> in the latter half.</p>



<p>It was funny how I ended up moving just as Aria-san had intended, without even realizing it.</p>



<p>“That’s because I thought Shizuru-chan would listen to you.”</p>



<p>“I can understand why you have been able to achieve your goals despite all the unreasonable requests and demands.”</p>



<p>“You can praise me more.”</p>



<p>“The real deal is yet to come!”</p>



<p>As we walked down the hallway, my phone pinged with a notification from LINE. I checked the message.</p>



<p><strong>Hinaka</strong>: <em>Yoryor seems a bit upset. We’re all meeting up at the cafeteria because it’s hot. Come over after you’re done!</em></p>



<p>Upon reading Miyachi’s report, I was grappling with an issue I needed to resolve first and foremost.</p>



<p>“So, did Yor-chan throw a tantrum?” Aria-san, apparently sensing the situation from my expression, casually peeked at my phone screen without permission.</p>



<p>“It’s all thanks to someone.”</p>



<p>“You’re just as guilty since we came together. Don’t try to pin it all on me.”</p>



<p>“I’m in trouble. I’ll head to the cafeteria for now.”</p>



<p>“In that case, let me lend a hand. My throat could use some quenching too.” Aria-san followed suit as if it were natural.</p>



<p>“Please, try not to confuse Yorka any further.”</p>



<p>Aria-san’s words had a tendency to resonate a bit too much with Yorka, who was fiercely protective of her sister. And with Kanzaki-sensei involved this time, things would be even more complicated than usual.</p>



<p>“If you think you can convince her on your own, go ahead. But what’s your plan?” Aria-san asked, seeming to enjoy my exhaustion.</p>



<p>“Since we’re in this together, I’ll take all the help I can get.”</p>



<p>“You should just ask for help outright.”</p>



<p>“I don’t know what I might be asked for in return.”</p>



<p>“I’m just as human as you are.”</p>



<p>“I can’t shake off the image of you as the dreadful demon queen.”</p>



<p>“You’re still saying stuff like that even in high school?”</p>



<p>“Well, from your perspective, I’m still just a kid.”</p>



<p>“Oh, come on. That’s not true,” Aria-san said, almost singing her words.</p>
