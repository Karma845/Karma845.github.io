<h1>Chapter 5: Not Even A Heartbreak</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>As Asaki headed to the restroom, the room was empty.</p>



<p>“Did she go home? But her bag is still here, and she hasn’t changed out of her uniform.”</p>



<p>The elevator indicators for both elevators showed upper floors.</p>



<p>“In that case…”</p>



<p>Asaki noticed the door leading to the external staircase. She opened the heavy door. The view was breathtaking, with a wide and pleasant sky. However, looking down, she saw a cluttered scene of buildings huddled near the station.</p>



<p>Yukinami Sayu was on a landing a few steps down, leaning against the railing and watching the sunset.</p>



<p>“Do you need a handkerchief?” Asaki, sensing the situation from Sayu’s back, offered comfort.</p>



<p>“…I’m fine. I have my own.”</p>



<p>“Despite being in a miniskirt police uniform?” At that remark, Sayu realized she only had a toy gun and handcuffs.</p>



<p>“Here, take this. Wipe away your tears.” Asaki, who was wearing her own cardigan over the nurse’s outfit, always had spare handkerchief in its pockets.</p>



<p>“Are you always prepared like this?”</p>



<p>“I always bring two, just in case.”</p>



<p>“If Asa-senpai were a guy, I’d definitely fall for you.” Sayu quietly accepted the handkerchief and gently wiped her cheek.</p>



<p>“Sayu-chan is a girl, and so am I,” Asaki answered with a light tone and stood next to Sayu, “Regular guys wouldn’t pull off such a smooth move.”</p>



<p>“Most guys either hold back too much or tend to be pushy with their feelings.”</p>



<p>The two chuckled together as they were understanding each other perfectly.</p>



<p>“Seriously, Asa-senpai, your timing is impeccable. You’ve got a good read on the situation.”</p>



<p>“I’ve always been good at reading atmospheres and figuring out what others want.”</p>



<p>This was one of Hasekura Asaki’s talents – sensing and interpreting others’ emotions and true feelings delicately, making accurate judgments about what actions would be appropriate. If she spoke the words the other person desired to hear, she was rarely met with resistance. Most often, it would be reciprocated as goodwill.</p>



<p>Thus, Asaki had never struggled with interpersonal relationships since childhood. Regardless of gender, she maintained a balanced distance with others, naturally becoming the focal point in any group she joined. Fortunately, Asaki didn’t mind being sought after in such a way.</p>



<p>At school, she was the class representative, and in the tea ceremony club she belonged to, she played a leadership role among her peers. People even remarked, <em>“There’s no one else but Hasekura-san for next year’s club president.”</em></p>



<p>In essence, she excelled at grasping people’s hearts. With a strong curiosity about others, she easily memorized people’s names. The more meticulously she observed someone, the more fascinating it was to discover their true character.</p>



<p>On the flip side, having an extensive memory of people’s various traits made it difficult to meet someone who truly excited her heart. Typically, they fell into familiar patterns of those she had met before.</p>



<p>Though Nanamura Ryu once was described as dreamy, she found herself overly rational when it came to romance. Every time someone confessed their feelings, her friends collectively suggested, “<em>Why not give it a shot and date them?</em>“</p>



<p>However, she couldn’t bring herself to date someone when she could already predict their personality from the start. Firstly, she couldn’t grasp the casual sense of dating. Moreover, investing time in something she knew would be boring seemed wasteful.</p>



<p>For Hasekura Asaki, who aspired to enter university through recommendation, preparing for the next future was more crucial than indulging in the pursuit of romance. Consequently, it was inevitable for love to have a lower priority.</p>



<p>However, an exception to this rule was Sena Kisumi.</p>



<p>At first glance, he was an unremarkable boy. He adeptly adjusted to others without realizing it. For Asaki, who was always accommodating to others, being the one accommodated was refreshingly comfortable. Gradually, their seemingly casual conversations became unexpectedly enjoyable.</p>



<p>“If someone as beautiful as Asa-senpai approached me at the perfect moment, I’d fall in love instantly. If I were confessed to, the answer would be an immediate ‘yes.’”</p>



<p>“But things didn’t go that smoothly…”</p>



<p>“You’re talking about the guy who rejected you, right? What on earth was the reason for that?”</p>



<p>“There was a formidable rival. That’s pretty much it.”</p>



<p>“A person who could rival Asa-senpai is rarity, probably only someone like Yor-senpai—” Sayu began to say so but froze. After a moment, she nervously went on to check something.</p>



<p>“Wait, the guy that Asa-senpai confessed to and got turned down… was it Ki-senpai?”</p>



<p>“Yeah,” Asaki admitted it casually.</p>



<p>“What?! No way! Why? Ugh, please, don’t let anything more unbelievable happen!” Sayu spun around wildly, her emotions in a whirlwind.</p>



<p>“Don’t move too much; it’s dangerous.”</p>



<p>It wouldn’t end well if she accidentally fell over the railing.</p>



<p>“I’m just shocked by something so unexpected.”</p>



<p>“Is it weird to like him?”</p>



<p>“Not weird, but I can’t figure out why you would deliberately choose him.”</p>



<p>“And that’s coming from you, Sayu-chan.”Asaki looked at her junior as if seeing through her.</p>



<p>“…Why did you decide to confess, Asa-senpai?”</p>



<p>“Wow, you’re really prying.”</p>



<p>“We’re the only ones here.” Sayu’s eyes pleaded for an answer. Indeed, the twilight on the external staircase was just right for a secret conversation.</p>



<p>“There are guys cooler than Kisumi-kun, ones with good grades, athletic, wealthy, intelligent, funny, lively—those kinds of traits that anyone can recognize. I don’t think he has those. He often says he’s plain and ordinary.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, he says that a lot,” Sayu vehemently agreed.</p>



<p>“But I don’t want a boyfriend I can brag about. Honestly, I think I would’ve been fine if we just stayed friends.”</p>



<p>In their second year, Hasekura Asaki ended up in the same class as Sena Kisumi. As class representatives, they had been in contact since the previous year. Knowing his character, he was a perfect partner for this year. He always looked out for everyone and provided thoughtful support.</p>



<p>It was easy to work with him, and if there were worries, they could share and think about them together. It was these small, daily accumulations that nurtured her feelings.</p>



<p>While Asaki was aware of her growing crush, she didn’t feel the need to rush and change their relationship. For her, romance wasn’t a top priority.</p>



<p>However, an event occurred that overturned that priority.</p>



<p>“When I saw his hurt expression, I realized it. I want to comfort him. I want him to smile when he’s with me. I want a deeper connection.”</p>



<p>With that, Sayu, who seemed to have calmed down, let the tears flowed once again.</p>



<p>“Why are you crying again?”</p>



<p>“Well… Asa-senpai’s story just resonated so much with me, I couldn’t help it.”</p>



<p>“As long as those tears are from being moved.” She patiently waited for Sayu’s sniffles to subside. The sky slowly transitioned from orange to purple, embracing the colors of the night.</p>



<p>“By the way, any tips for confessing?” Now that Sayu had calmed down, she sought further advice.</p>



<p>“Are you asking someone who got rejected?”</p>



<p>“If it’s Asa-senpai’s confession, success is practically guaranteed under normal circumstances!”</p>



<p>“Success in confessing depends on compatibility and timing,” Asaki stated concisely, “You build up communication, let feelings grow, and then, for the finishing touch, you confess.”</p>



<p>“Confession is the finishing touch?”</p>



<p>“Yes. The time spent doesn’t matter. If you confess without the right foundation, it’ll fail. In the end, compatibility and timing are important.”</p>



<p>“Even knowing that, Asa-senpai, you still failed, right?”</p>



<p>“I got hit with a twist at the end.”</p>



<p>That afterschool moment, that instant, was supposed to be perfect. Intuitively, Asaki confessed her feelings to him who was hurting. He was lost, but they could have become a couple if things had gone smoothly.</p>



<p>Fate, however, betrayed her expectations by introducing the strongest rival at the perfect moment.</p>



<p>Arisaka Yorka, with her whole being on the line, came to reclaim Sena Kisumi, her boyfriend. Asaki couldn’t match such passionate behavior. Feeling impressed, Asaki gracefully stepped back.</p>



<p>The same went for today’s karaoke party. As soon as Asaki decided to attend karaoke, Arisaka Yorka also wanted to come. Despite thinking she’d be on high alert, when they started talking about love, Arisaka Yorka was the first to resonate with her.</p>



<p>“Love is interesting, isn’t it? No matter how smoothly you think things are going, there’s always that one percent that’s unimaginable.”</p>



<p>And here, she encountered a junior in a similar situation.</p>



<p>“Sayu-chan, you like Kisumi-kun too, don’t you?”</p>



<p>“H-How did you know?!” Caught off guard by Asaki’s keen observation, Sayu was visibly flustered.</p>



<p>“Eyes speak louder than words. The way you look at Kisumi-kun is practically overflowing with love.”</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai hasn’t figured it out, right? It’s really hard to step back now.”</p>



<p>“He hasn’t noticed.” Asaki said it with a hint of jest.</p>



<p>“I shot him a really intense glare earlier.”</p>



<p>“You’re being too soft. If there’s anyone you need to compete with, it’s Arisaka-san. She’d be glaring even sharper.”</p>



<p>“Doesn’t it scare him to face those beautiful eyes head-on?”</p>



<p>“He’s fine with it. That’s probably why they’re dating.”</p>



<p>“Is he into BDSM or something?”</p>



<p>“Who knows? But among all the guys who get intimidated by Arisaka-san, Kisumi-kun is the only one who became her boyfriend.”</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai is shameless when it matters, isn’t he? He’s always unfazed by it all.”</p>



<p>“But you chased after him relentlessly and entered the same high school, right?”</p>



<p>Sayu let out a deep sigh. “It’s not as romantic as that.”</p>



<p>“If you’re okay with it, I’d like to hear your story this time.” Asaki’s gentle call made Sayu’s shoulders tremble.</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai has always been so close. Being around him felt natural, easy, and fun. I only realized these feelings were romantic after he retired from the club.”</p>



<p>“Why didn’t you confess right away?”</p>



<p>“Once I became aware of it, I suddenly couldn’t speak well. Right when Ki-senpai retired, he shifted into full exam mode, and our communication frequency dropped.”</p>



<p>“You couldn’t meet during club activities, you had different grades, you were also holding back on contact. That’s the opposite of typical romantic theories.”</p>



<p>“I, um, was just being considerate of Ki-senpai.”</p>



<p>“That’s just an excuse for not taking action.”</p>



<p>“That’s harsh.”</p>



<p>“Because if you had confessed during middle school, you’d probably be dating now. At least, the odds would be a hundred times better than they are now.”</p>



<p>As she watched Sena Kisumi and Yukinami Sayu’s strong bond, she felt that with the right opportunity, transitioning from friendship to romance would have been effortless.</p>



<p>─At least, during their middle school days, the criteria of compatibility and timing were met.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I didn’t expect Ki-senpai would get a girlfriend in high school.” Sayu’s hidden sense of despair and sadness became visible. “I thought there wouldn’t be anyone audacious enough to fall for Ki-senpai!” </p>



<p>Her genuine lament was pitiful to witness. </p>



<p>“And why is his friendship circle even more glamorous now? Nanamura-senpai is the basketball ace, Miyauchi-senpai is super cute. Asa-senpai is incredibly perceptive and beautiful, even holding the position of class reps together. And then there’s Yor-senpai! Despite being the ultimate-spec girl, why is she dating Ki-senpai? It’s unbelievable!” Her pent-up emotions exploded.</p>



<p>From Sayu’s perspective, who knew Sena Kisumi as a plain and ordinary boy from middle school, the vibrancy of his friends in high school was shocking.</p>



<p>“Haha. You’re really letting heartbreak get to you.”</p>



<p>“It’s not a laughing matter. Besides, I haven’t even experienced heartbreak yet.” Sayu, bathed in the light of the setting sun, exuded a melancholic air.</p>



<p>“It takes courage to chase someone all the way to high school.”</p>



<p>“I also feel like I’m going in circles. But wouldn’t it be fun to attend the same school as the person you like and experience romance?”</p>



<p>“Why are you so fixated on Kisumi-kun?”</p>



<p>“Part of it is like stubbornness. Even when I try to forget, I can’t…”</p>



<p>“It’s essential to draw a line. If you’ve liked him since middle school, you’ve been nursing those feelings for nearly three years, right? Holding onto emotions for that long can be toxic.”</p>



<p>“I-I tried confessing once! But Ki-senpai didn’t show up.”</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun isn’t the type to forget promises. Did the message get through properly?”</p>



<p>“I sent him a LINE to come support me at my retirement game! He read it, and that’s it.”</p>



<p>Seeing Sayu sulking over the memory was quite adorable.</p>



<p>“If it’s that upsetting, you would get mad and start disliking him.”</p>



<p>“He didn’t even reply, that’s never happened before…”</p>



<p>“Did you make sure about that?”</p>



<p>Sayu avoided eye contact and maintained a silence.</p>



<p>“Alright. Then let’s go confirm it now.” Asaki turned to head upstairs excitedly, but Sayu grabbed her arm and held her back.</p>



<p>“Well, I was too scared to check last summer! Is that so wrong?”</p>



<p>The mention of last summer aligned with the time when Sena Kisumi quit the basketball team. Sayu seemed unaware of this fact judging by her tone.</p>



<p>“You are obviously the one who will suffer if you cannot make up your mind.”</p>



<p>“I know! I know, okay!”</p>



<p>Sayu was painfully aware that prolonging this situation only raised the hurdles. While her one-sided feelings might never be reciprocated, the lack of clarity allowed her to enjoy the situation. The uncertainty lingering provided a glimmer of hope—sometimes, that alone could be a source of comfort.</p>



<p>“Sayu-chan, if you want to go back to your middle school days, I don’t recommend it.”</p>



<p>“Actually, I’d rather decline. It’s irritating enough how Ki-senpai still treats me the same as in middle school.”</p>



<p>“That’s just like Kisumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. He hasn’t changed at all. That’s why it’s even more frustrating.”</p>



<p>“Frustrating?”</p>



<p>Sayu bit her lower lip, articulating the smoldering feelings within her. “He’s been taking care of me just because we live close by. Because of that, he was teased by the upperclassmen in the boys’ basketball team. He got mocked <em>as</em> the exclusive manager for Yukinami Sayu. But those guys, they can’t even compare to Ki-senpai! No matter how small the tasks, he never slacks off. He doesn’t get swayed by others’ opinions, silently and diligently fulfilling what’s important. It’s that sincerity and depth of character that I find appealing…”</p>



<p>“So, you’re upset that others have noticed his charms too. The complexities of a maiden’s heart.” Asaki smiled warmly at the earnest underclassman.</p>



<p>“If only Ki-senpai had made a flashy high school debut and acted all frivolous, it would’ve been easier to dispel the illusion.” Sayu lifted her head and straightened her posture.</p>



<p>“But the fact that you approached Kisumi-kun means you haven’t given up, right?” Asaki inquired about her true feelings.</p>



<p>“Yes. I’ll bring closure to this love.”</p>



<p>Asaki smiled at her spirited words that was reminiscent of her former sporty girl.</p>



<p>“Alright, in exchange for my support, I’ll give you one hint. You should him ask directly about the reason he couldn’t come to your retirement game last summer.”</p>



<p>Sayu widened her eyes at the concrete advice. “Got it! I’ll check with him!”</p>



<p>“Good. Shall we head back then?”</p>



<p>As they climbed the stairs and approached the door, Sayu apologized. “I’m sorry about earlier. I invited you for a distraction, and yet, I ended up being all snappy.”</p>



<p>“Guiding a lost junior is also a senpai’s duty. Don’t worry about it.”</p>



<p>“Um, can I start calling you ‘sensei’ from now on?”</p>



<p>“I’d rather you didn’t.”</p>



<p>“Aww, Asa-senpai, you’re so strict.”</p>



<p>“<em>Sigh</em>, I fell right into a maiden’s love territory. We dove deep into love talk.”</p>



<p>“Don’t sigh right after saying you’re guiding your junior!”</p>



<p>“Well, Sayu-chan, you’re way more serious about this than I imagined.”</p>



<p>“Life is short, so just fall in love. That’s the saying, right?”</p>



<p>Those words unexpectedly struck a chord in Asaki’s heart.</p>



<p>“…How many more times will we fall in love?” Asaki opened the door.</p>



<p>“If it’s Asa-senpai, I think you can do it as many times as you want.”</p>



<p>“Dating and genuinely falling in love aren’t necessarily the same.”</p>



<p>Some people might genuinely fall in love with someone every time. But for Hasekura Asaki, that was impossible.</p>



<p><em>─Especially if she wants to be loved by someone she genuinely loves.</em></p>



<p>Asaki finally realized something simple.</p>



<p>“I see. I’m jealous of Arisaka-san.” She whispered softly, making sure no one could hear.</p>



<p>The moment she put it into words, she finally noticed that the discomfort she had been feeling was the pain of unrequited love.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>When Asaki-san and Sayu returned, Nanamura had just finished his passionate singing.</p>



<p>“Welcome back. That was quite a long toilet break.”</p>



<p>“Nanamura-kun, you have no tact. You’re the worst,” Asaki-san said while laughing before returning to her seat.</p>



<p>Sayu looked at me with an unusual tense expression. </p>



<p>“…What is it, Sayu? Why the scary face?”</p>



<p>“Um, I have a question. Is it okay to ask?”</p>



<p>“Why the formality? Sure, go ahead.”</p>



<p>Sayu’s nervousness was palpable, making me inadvertently braced myself. Yorka and Miyachi were also waiting for Sayu’s next words.</p>



<p>“Um! Please tell me the reason!”</p>



<p>“The reason for what?”</p>



<p>“Why you didn’t come to my retirement game last summer!”</p>



<p>“Retirement game…”</p>



<p>“I messaged you, didn’t I? And you even read it. I just wanted you to cheer for me at my last game in middle school. Or you could have at least refused or something!”</p>



<p>Almost squeezing the words out, she questioned me.</p>



<p><em>Last summer…</em></p>



<p>“Ah!?”</p>



<p><em>Right, it was around that time.</em></p>



<p>“Sayu, I’m sorry. I was dealing with quite a bit of trouble at that time.”</p>



<p>“Apologizing now won’t make me forgive you!” Sayu naturally became displeased after seeing my reaction.</p>



<p>“Hey, Yukinami-chan, are you talking about the summer tournament? Do you still remember the date?”</p>



<p>Nanamura asked with an unusually serious voice. When Sayu provided the date, both Nanamura and Miyachi seemed to understand.</p>



<p>“…Oh. Could it be <em>that</em> time?” Yorka also seemed to have remembered.</p>



<p>“Huh? What happened last summer?” Sayu asked suspiciously at their reactions.</p>



<p>“Sorry, Yukinami-chan. The reason Sena couldn’t come to support you was my fault. There was some commotion at that time, and Sena wasn’t at fault at all.”</p>



<p>“Why is Nanamura-senpai apologizing? Please tell me properly.”</p>



<p>Seeing the ever-confident Nanamura apologized himself, Sayu became increasingly bewildered.</p>



<p>“There was a fight during a practice match with another school in the basketball club. Sumisumi took the blame for protecting Nanamu and left the club,” Miyachi calmly explained.</p>



<p>“Sayu, I’m sorry for not answering you. I was in a pretty tough spot back then. My bad…”</p>



<p>“N-No. Ki-senpai, you’re really something. Um, well, it’s quite surprising. You defended your friend with such manly spirit. I guess it can’t be helped. I thought you just hated me.”</p>



<p>Sayu was taken aback by the truth from a year ago.</p>



<p>“There’s no way that’s true! If I had known, I would’ve gone to cheer you on!”</p>



<p>“I’m relieved to know that you didn’t ignore me in purpose.”</p>



<p>Upon receiving my apology, Sayu became more modest.</p>



<p>“Yeah, yeah. I’d be annoyed if Kisumi didn’t reply me.” Yorka deeply sympathizes beside her.</p>



<p>“Don’t agree with her there.”</p>



<p>“It’s unsettling when there’s no response.”</p>



<p>“You didn’t even bother message me until we started dating.”</p>



<p>“I enjoy chatting with you on LINE. If it bothers you, I’ll endure it a bit, though…” Yorka, who exchanged messages with me, had a somewhat sad expression. If I accidentally fell asleep before her, I woke up to messages full of complaints the next morning. Strangely, I found even those complaints endearing.</p>



<p>“Remember, you sent a message exactly at midnight the other day.”</p>



<p>I wonder how long Yorka, who couldn’t endure even half a day without communicating, manage to hold back for several days.</p>



<p>“Oh, that was just to make sure you woke up on time the next morning!”</p>



<p>“I know. I enjoy it too, so please keep it this way.”</p>



<p>“That’s a relief!” Yorka’s expression brightened instantly. Her genuine reaction made me happy too.</p>



<p>“Hey, don’t get too cozy amidst all this. Enough with the sappy moments! We still have time until closing, so since we’re here at the karaoke, let’s sing more!”</p>



<p>“We’ve been singing while you two were away, so go ahead.”</p>



<p>Nanamura and Miyachi encouraged us to pick a song.</p>



<p>“Alright, then I’ll sing!” Sayu suddenly regained energy and enthusiastically grabbed the microphone. A lively, upbeat song started playing, and she sang with the enthusiasm of a fish in water.</p>



<p>During the instrumental break, Sayu glanced briefly in Asaki-san’s direction. Seeing the pleased expression on her junior’s face, Asaki-san nodded in satisfaction.</p>



<p>The two who had returned seem to be bound by a strong, unspoken trust.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;">3</strong></p>


<p>“Thanks for covering mine. I appreciate it!”</p>



<p>As a celebration for her enrollment, we, the second-years, decided to treat Sayu. After settling the bill as the one in charge, I stepped outside, and it was already night. Everyone waiting outside seemed a bit tired, probably from the extended singing session.</p>



<p>“Ah, my throat hurts from screaming too much at the end.”</p>



<p>“Nanamu, don’t you use your voice a lot in club activities?” In response to the overly excited Nanamura, Miyachi, who was skilled at singing, looked unfazed.</p>



<p>“As the time to leave approaches, don’t you feel like giving it your all?”</p>



<p>“I get it. It’s like suddenly remembering songs you haven’t sung yet,” Miyachi then took out throat lozenges from her bag. “I guess it can’t be helped.”</p>



<p>“Oh, thanks, Miyauchi.”</p>



<p>“Sumisumi, Yoryor, are you two okay? Do you want one?”</p>



<p>“I’m fine. You’re so well prepared.”</p>



<p>“I’m good too. Thanks.” Yorka stood beside Miyachi, her expression composed. Looking back at today, she mostly talked with me and Miyachi and responded only briefly to Nanamura, Asaki-san, and Sayu.</p>



<p>It was very much like Yorka. However, just having her participate in this large gathering outside school was a step forward.</p>



<p>“Anyone need throat lozenges?”</p>



<p>“I’ll take some!”</p>



<p>“I want one too. Thanks, Hinaka-chan.”</p>



<p>Sayu and Asaki-san also accepted the throat lozenges.</p>



<p>“It seems like Asaki-chan and Yukinami-chan have become quite close.” Miyachi showed interest in the changing dynamics between the two.</p>



<p>“Asa-senpai is my teacher!”</p>



<p>“Don’t call me that,” Asaki-san chuckled.</p>



<p>“Sayu, don’t get too clingy. The same goes for you, Asaki-san. You can a bit more harsh with her.”</p>



<p>When I offered some unsolicited advice, Sayu replied, “Do you hear that, Asa-senpai? This, right here.”</p>



<p>“I see. A reaction like a middle schooler.”</p>



<p>The two exchanged glances and seemingly reached an understanding.</p>



<p>“Today was fun, so let’s gather again sometime. We’ll leave the organizing to Sena. This is the official launch of the Sena Club!”</p>



<p>“Sena Club, agreed.”</p>



<p>Nanamura and Miyachi decided this without consent.</p>



<p>“What’s this Sena Club thing?”</p>



<p>“It’s a sign of respect for the organizer.”</p>



<p>“So basically, you just want to leave all the planning to me whenever you want to play, right?”</p>



<p>“That’s one way to put it,” Nanamura admitted.</p>



<p>“It’s fine. I’m in too,” said Asaki-san enthusiastically.</p>



<p>“Um, can I join too?” The junior, Sayu, hesitated before tentatively raising her hand. Nanamura, Miyachi, and Asaki-san naturally approved.</p>



<p>“Now, what about Arisaka-chan?”</p>



<p>Nanamura inquired on behalf of everyone. All eyes were on Yorka. She, slightly nervous, responded.</p>



<p>“…Today was more enjoyable than I expected. If Kisumi is in charge, I’ll join too.” With my girlfriend saying that, I had no reason to refuse. Unanimously, the Sena Club was established.</p>



<p>As the organizer, I wrapped up today’s event.</p>



<p>“Thanks for today, everyone. See you after Golden Week<sup data-fn="b071a062-a542-4848-95cc-57cf47ba3bab" class="fn"><a href="#b071a062-a542-4848-95cc-57cf47ba3bab" id="b071a062-a542-4848-95cc-57cf47ba3bab-link">1</a></sup> at school.”</p>



<p>With those parting words, the first gathering of the Sena Club came to an end.</p>
