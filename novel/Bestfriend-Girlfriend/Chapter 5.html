<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Shimizu-san and Misunderstanding 1</strong></p>

<p>“…Doesn’t look like the others are coming.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>One afternoon, as the day for stargazing was fast approaching, I was in the Astronomy Club room with Seto.</p>

<p>“Hondō said he couldn’t make it today due to some errands. Have you heard anything from Ai and Yousuke?”</p>
<p>“Ai Senpai said she’d be late because of student council duties. I think it’s probably the same for Sakata Senpai.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>The conversation feels awkward.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s because I haven’t spent much time talking with Seto one-on-one.</p>

<p>“Am I bothering you?”</p>

<p>Seto tilts her head.</p>

<p>“No, you’re not.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear.”</p>

<p>Seto looks away from me. It seems like the conversation has reached a temporary end, and silence fills the club room.</p>
<p>But I wanted to clarify something while I had the chance.</p>

<p>“Hey, Seto.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Can I talk to you for a moment?”</p>
<p>“Sure, what’s up?”</p>
<p>“There’s something I want to tell you.”</p>
<p>“…What a coincidence. I also have something I want to say to Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>This is unexpected.</p>
<p>I never thought Seto would have something she wanted to say to me as well.</p>

<p>“Then, who’s going to go first?”</p>
<p>“Before that, I want to ask something. What do you want to talk about?”</p>
<p>“…it’s about Hondō-kun.”</p>
<p>“I see. I think what you want to say and what I want to say might be the same.”</p>

<p>I’m not certain, but I have a feeling that was the case.</p>

<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Should we say it at the same time?”</p>
<p>“Let’s do that. When I say ‘ready, set,’ we’ll do it together.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>

<p>Both of us take a deep breath simultaneously.</p>

<p>“Ready, set!”</p>
<p>“You like Hondō, don’t you!?”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san, I know you have feelings for Hondō-kun.”</p>
<p>“What!?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>The part about me liking Hondō was correct, but the rest of the conversation was drastically different from what I thought.</p>

<p>“Why… why do you think I like… I mean, have feelings for Hondō…?”</p>
<p>“Before that, answer my question. Why did you think I had feelings for Hondō-kun?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>

<p>To explain that, I would have to admit that I was pretending to be asleep when Hondō and Seto were talking about love.</p>

<p>“Ah, I know you were feigning sleep when Hondō-kun and I were talking about love. So you don’t have to worry about that getting out.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>

<p>I inadvertently let out a flustered voice.</p>
<p>She knew I was pretending to be asleep? Then why…?</p>
<p>There’s a lot I want to say, but first, I have to answer Seto’s question.</p>

<p>“In that case, let’s make this quick. You and him… you often chatted about love with Hondō! And you always asked Hondō for his opinion! You’re doing that because you secretly like Hondō and you’re trying to gather references for later, right!?”</p>

<p>I pointed at Seto with vigor. But Seto said nothing.</p>

<p>“Hmph, hit the nail on the head, didn’t I? I’m so spot-on that you can’t even speak. I knew it, I’m not wrong…”</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>

<p>Just when I thought he’d speak, Seto let out a big sigh.</p>

<p>“Why are you sighing? Are you mocking me?”</p>

<p>Even Ai never sighed at me like that.</p>
<p>That prolonged sigh hurt more than I expected.</p>

<p>“Sorry, I didn’t mean to. The reason I didn’t respond earlier is not because you were right but because I was dumbfounded. None of Shimizu’s guesses about me are correct.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“First off, I’m not romantically interested in Hondō-kun. The reason I talk about love with him is to confirm whether my feelings for the person I’m truly curious about are actually romantic.”</p>
<p>“…Are you sure you don’t like Hondō?”</p>
<p>“That’s how it is.”</p>

<p>There’s no change in Seto’s expression, but she doesn’t seem to be lying.</p>

<p>“I see…”</p>

<p>I felt a weight lifted off my heart. So that was it.</p>
<p>I had thought Seto liked Hondō, but it seems I was mistaken.</p>

<p>“…you can relax.”</p>

<p>Seto whispered as if reading my mind.</p>

<p>“W-What’s that supposed to mean? Whether or not you like Hondō doesn’t matter to me!”</p>

<p>I blurted out something I didn’t mean to say.</p>
<p>I felt a little disgusted with myself.</p>

<p>“That’s a lie. Because you like Hondō-kun, you must be extremely curious about what I think of him.”</p>
<p>“You said that earlier, but why do you think I like… um, have feelings for Hondō?”</p>
<p>“There are many pieces of evidence.”</p>
<p>“…tell me.”</p>

<p>I don’t recall leaving any evidence.</p>
<p>Seto must be making things up.</p>

<p>“First, the hairstyle.”</p>

<p>For a moment, my heart skipped a beat, because it was something that struck me.</p>

<p>“The day after Hondō-kun mentioned his favorite hairstyle being a half-up, you came with that exact hairstyle. If you didn’t think anything of Hondō-kun, you wouldn’t have done that.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>

<p>It’s not strange for Seto to know I changed my hairstyle since we are in the same class and club.</p>
<p>But deducting the reason…she’s quite observant.</p>

<p>“That… that was a coincidence.”</p>
<p>“There are various ways to arrange a half-up hairstyle. Was the fact that it was identical to the magazine also a coincidence?”</p>
<p>“…It was also a coincidence.”</p>
<p>“Didn’t you reference the fashion magazine where I had placed sticky notes?”</p>
<p>“I said it’s a coincidence!”</p>
<p>“It’s too much for that to be a coincidence… Well, fine. There’s more evidence.”</p>
<p>“There’s more?”</p>
<p>“Of course. The second is the timing of when you watched ’21 Gram of Difference.’ “</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>

<p>It’s too close to home. Seto continued without minding my reaction.</p>

<p>“On the day Hondō-kun mentioned it would be fun to watch the same anime with someone he’s interested in and share opinions, you immediately watched ’21 Gram of Difference,’ which Hondō-kun had mentioned. It’s clear you were being conscious of him.”</p>
<p>“That’s… that’s because Ai later said ‘Twenty-One Gram Difference’ was interesting, so I got curious.”</p>
<p>“…You still won’t admit it?”</p>

<p>Seto stared intently at me.</p>
<p>It was as if she was saying I should just admit it and find relief.</p>

<p>“Give up. There’s no more evidence left, right?”</p>
<p>“…Fine. I didn’t want to bring this up, but…”</p>

<p>Other than the previous two incidents, I never acted after listening to Seto and Hondō’s love stories.</p>
<p>So, Seto shouldn’t have any more evidence to present, but…</p>

<p>“Just because Hondō-kun said he wanted to try a homemade bento, you specifically made one for him. It can only be thought of as you liking Hondō-kun.”</p>
<p>“How do you even know about that…”</p>

<p>I regretted saying that as soon as the words left my mouth.</p>

<p>“I knew it.”</p>
<p>“You set a trap for me!”</p>
<p>“I saw Shimizu-san give the bento to Hondō-kun. And Hondō-kun had mentioned a while ago that he’d be happy if someone made a bento for him. Considering these two pieces of information, it’s not hard to think taht Shimizu-san made the bento for Hondō-kun. But I had no proof.”</p>
<p>“So you were checking my reaction…”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>It seems Seto was a step ahead of me. But something still bothered me.</p>

<p>“Why were you watching me give Hondō the bento? Neither he nor I were members of the Astronomy Club at the time. Isn’t it strange for you to be watching us?”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>

<p>Seto suddenly averted her eyes.</p>
<p>Suspicious. She’s hiding something.</p>

<p>“Don’t tell me you actually like Hondō…”</p>
<p>“…sigh.”</p>

<p>Seto sighed again, this time seemingly half out of disappointment and half relief.</p>

<p>“You! You sighed again! Seriously, stop it!”</p>
<p>“Sorry. I just thought Shimizu-san was only looking at Hondō-kun.”</p>
<p>“You’re not listening at all. You can say whatever you want…anyway, why were you watching us?”</p>
<p>“…Can I remain silent?”</p>
<p>“No way. Just spill it and be done with it.”</p>

<p>I felt like a detective trying to get a confession from a suspect.</p>

<p>“…I want you to promise me one thing.”</p>
<p>“Getting all serious now? Go on.”</p>
<p>“If you’re going to be angry, don’t just be angry with me, be angry with Ai Senpai to.”</p>
<p>“Ai is involved in this too?”</p>

<p>I have a bad feeling about this.</p>
<p>When it comes to Ai, these hunches usually turn out to be right.</p>

<p>“Okay, so why were you watching Hondō and me?”</p>
<p>“…I was asked to keep an eye on Shimizu-san.”</p>

<p>At that moment, a certain phrase crossed my mind.</p>

<p>『I have an accomplice in Kei’s class. That’s all there is to it.』</p>

<p>I think Ai said something like that the night I gave the homemade bento to Hondō.</p>


<p>“So you’re the accomplice in the class working with Ai!”</p>
<p>“Yes. Did you hear about it from Ai Senpai?”</p>
<p>“But I couldn’t ask her who it was! Since when? Since when were you asked to do this?”</p>
<p>“Since our first year.”</p>
<p>“That long ago?!”</p>

<p>I had never realized it.</p>
<p>I’d like to believe it’s not because I’m oblivious but because Seto was very discreet.</p>

<p>“Although I say ‘watching’, it was mostly just updating Ai Senpai about Shimizu-san’s situation from time to time. It wasn’t much of a job.”</p>
<p>“…Still, it’s impressive you kept it up from our first year until now.”</p>
<p>“For dorayaki.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Every time I report about Shimizu-san to Ai Senpai, I occasionally get dorayaki.”</p>
<p>“You were lured in by food?!”</p>

<p>I thought Seto was a loyal junior, looking out for her senior.</p>
<p>Turns out she’s more pragmatic than I thought.</p>

<p>“You can’t blame me, Dorayaki is delicious. So? Are you ready to admit you like Hondō?”</p>
<p>“Wha—”</p>

<p>Come to think of it, that’s what we were originally talking about.</p>

<p>“There’s more evidence, like how you two were closely working together during cooking class. I have plenty more.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>“It’s easier if you just admit you like him.”</p>

<p>Suddenly, our roles have been reversed.</p>

<p>“I get it…”</p>
<p>“Sorry, I couldn’t hear you. What did you say?”</p>
<p>“I said I get it! Yes, I like Hondō!”</p>

<p>I unintentionally raised my voice.</p>
<p>I hope it didn’t echo into the hallway.</p>

<p>“…Say something.”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san, you really do like Hondō.”</p>
<p>“You’re the one who pointed it out!”</p>
<p>“I did, but I wasn’t completely sure…”</p>

<p>I thought that with all the evidence Seto provided, she was sure I had feelings for Hondō.</p>
<p>Apparently, I was mistaken.</p>

<p>“Okay then. Now that you know I… li-like Hondō, what are you going to do?”</p>
<p>“…There’s something I’d like your help with.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, Seto brought up something I hadn’t considered.</p>

<p>“Just so you know, if you ask for Dorayaki in exchange for not telling anyone, I’ll refuse.”</p>
<p>“…I won’t do that.”</p>
<p>“Hey, what was that pause? Did you consider it for a moment after hearing my words?”</p>
<p>“I wouldn’t threaten someone over dorayaki… probably.”</p>
<p>“You should say that with more confidence…”</p>

<p>Otherwise, I’d have to always carry dorayaki with me just to keep Seto’s mouth shut.</p>

<p>“…I can get my dorayaki from Ai Senpai. Anyway, let’s get back to the topic. What I meant to say is, we can help each other out.”</p>
<p>“Help each other out?”</p>
<p>“Yes, like how I can chat with Hondō about love while you pretend to be asleep, just as before, and get to know his preferences in girls.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Actually, the last time we chatted about love, I listened to Hondō with the intention of telling you.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Then, thank you for that.”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome. So, what do you think? It’s not a bad deal, right?”</p>
<p>“… It’s not a bad deal for me, sure. But what’s in it for you? What do you want me to do for you?”</p>

<p>Earlier, Seto had mentioned that we could help each other out.</p>
<p>That means she must want some kind of favor from me.</p>

<p>“…There are two things I want.”</p>
<p>“Tell me.”</p>
<p>“First, I want you to teach me about love.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I want you to teach me about love.”</p>

<p>“I heard you the first time. No but, what do you mean by that?”</p>

<p>She said it with a serious face, so I don’t think she’s joking. But it’s too vague.</p>

<p>“You just admitted you like Hondō. That means you’re in love. If you’re in love, you should know about it. I don’t understand what love is, and I want you to teach me.”</p>
<p>“I don’t fully understand love either…”</p>
<p>“Whatever you know is enough.”</p>

<p>I look at Seto again, and her eyes are filled with seriousness.</p>

<p>“For instance, what do you like about Hondō?”</p>
<p>“W-What? Why all of a sudden? Well… I like that he sees not just my appearance but who I truly am inside.”</p>
<p>“I see… Next question. When did you realize you liked Hondō?”</p>
<p>“Er… during our first year of high school.”</p>
<p>“I hadn’t noticed that. Next, do you want to kiss Hondō?”</p>
<p>“Wh-What the heck are you saying?!”</p>

<p>I imagine it in my head.</p>
<p>Hondō’s face comes closer…and then our silhouettes merge…</p>

<p>“… Shimizu-san, you’re so cute.”</p>
<p>“…if you want to pick a fight, I’m ready….”</p>
<p>“I didn’t mean it that way, sorry. It’s just that seeing you blush while imagining a kiss is so different from your usual demeanor.”</p>
<p>“… Don’t do that again.”</p>
<p>“Understood. What I wanted to say is that I’d like you to answer questions like these.”</p>

<p>So, she wants to understand the emotions I feel towards Hondō as a reference.</p>

<p>“…Alright. But even if you’re not convinced by my answer, I don’t care.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. Thank you, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“You mentioned there was another thing you wanted help with. Tell me.”</p>
<p>“I want help getting closer to the person I’m interested in.”</p>

<p>She’s made another request that’s very specific.</p>

<p>“First of all, who are you interested in?”</p>
<p>“…Ah.”</p>

<p>Seto seems to have just realized she didn’t mention the name of the person she’s interested in.</p>

<p>“Do I have to say the name?”</p>
<p>“How can I help you get closer to him if you don’t tell me his name?”</p>
<p>“…You have a point. Fine, I’ll say it. The person I’m interested in is… Matsuoka-kun. Toshiya Matsuoka.”</p>

<p>It took Seto less time than I thought to say the name.</p>
<p>It’s honestly surprising to find out he’s interested in Matsuoka.</p>
<p>…Matsuoka? Come to think of it, didn’t he say he liked Seto?</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>What should I do? Should I tell her? That Matsuoka likes her?</p>
<p>Seto has consistently said he’s ‘interested’ in Matsuoka, which means she hasn’t really confirmed her feelings yet.</p>
<p>Honestly, I don’t really know Matsuoka, but spilling the beans about someone’s feelings before a confession seems a bit cruel.</p>

<p>“Nothing, never mind.”</p>

<p>I decided to keep quiet about Matsuoka’s feelings towards Seto.</p>

<p>“Really? So, Shimizu-san, will you help me get closer to Matsuoka-kun?”</p>
<p>“What exactly do you want me to do? I’m not close to Matsuoka.”</p>
<p>“True. Matsuoka seems to be afraid of you.”</p>
<p>“You could’ve sugar-coated that a bit.”</p>

<p>Seto’s remarks, unintentional or not, can sometimes be a bit sharp.</p>

<p>“Sorry. I don’t need you to do anything immediately. But if there’s anything I’d like you to do, I’ll let you know.”</p>
<p>“Got it. But if I don’t want to, I’ll refuse.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine. I’d be happy if Shimizu-san would help, but only when you genuinely want to.”</p>

<p>With that, Seto extended her hand towards me.</p>

<p>“What’s with the hand?”</p>
<p>“It’s a gesture to formally say I’m looking forward to working with you’.”</p>
<p>“…Just know that if you regret collaborating with me, I won’t be responsible.”</p>

<p>I took Seto’s hand.</p>
<p>I thought I saw the corner of Seto’s mouth lift slightly, but it was probably just my imagination.</p>
