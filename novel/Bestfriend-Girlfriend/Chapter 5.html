<h1>Chapter 5: Researcher Shiwaoi Overstates the Broken Speech a Bit</h1>

<p>“Alright everyone, welcome to the first school-wide event of the season! I’m Kurosu from the broadcasting club, your Emcee for today, pleased to meetcha!”  <br /> <br />The spirited Emcee was greeted with loud applause, and the event was underway. <br /> <br />“As you all know, this isn’t just any event! It’s the [Make Teio Ten Sai Tera Awayuki Cry] meeting! With prodigious, once-in-a-century talent said to be the number one Teio Ten Sai in overall ability, let’s make the genius [Awayuki Tera] cry! And the challenger who successfully draws tears from Awayuki-san will gain the unbelievable right to instantly swap places and become the next [Teio Ten Sai]! This is…this is heating up!” <br /> <br />Egged on by the Emcee, cheers and applause rose from the crowd. <br /> <br />Just like Sakuraba’s class when they debated against Houjou, the pacing was incredibly smooth…like a pro’s.  <br /> <br />With such outstanding talent even outside the Teio Ten Sai, as expected of Teio academy. <br /> <br />“Now let’s hear a word from today’s star, Awayuki Tera-san!” <br /> <br />The Emcee walked over to the special VIP seating on stage─an excessively lavish set with vivid roses and chrysanthemums piled high behind and on the table─where Awayuki sat and asked her for a comment. <br /> <br />“I’m #12, Tera Awayuki. A friend signed me up without my knowledge, so I have no idea why I’m here. I can only sing [Yo-saku]. Oh, and I stuffed balloons in my boobs to pad my bra size, so please excuse me from the swimsuit inspection.” <br /> <br />“Ah, Awayuki-san, this isn’t an idol audition.” <br /> <br />The crowd let out a <em>doht</em> of laughter.  <br /> <br />A clip-on mic near Awayuki’s collar allowed her soft voice to echo clearly through the venue. <br /> <br />“Ha…as always, skilled at entertaining people. Buuut! Today we’ll be doing the opposite. The elite who passed the audition lie in wait, ready to draw out Awayuki-san’s tears!” <br /> <br />“Tch, tch… Why aren’t I part of those elite!?”  <br /> <br />Next to me, Ohana gnashed her teeth in frustration. <br /> <br />“There’s no way you’d pass with that [Little Match Girl] act…” <br /> <br />“It was a completely redone revised version…uu…but being rejected means nothing… I wanted to help Tera-san somehow…” <br /> <br />Apparently the audition had quite the number of applicants regardless of Ohana. <br /> <br />According to Principal Ougami, many students here had their spirits broken by the sheer strength of the Teio Ten Sai and lost their will to try taking those seats. <br /> <br />So to those discouraged students, [Making Awayuki Tera Cry] probably looked more achievable.  <br /> <br />But in truth, I don’t think it’ll be that easy. <br /> <br />Like I felt last Sunday, while Awayuki’s emotions surely exist deep down, the door locking them away probably won’t open with half-baked efforts. <br /> <br />As Ohana said, the mood of the venue is important. Depending on the flow and excitement, it could greatly help draw out Awayuki’s tears. <br /> <br />But something still feels lacking. <br /> <br />To force open that door, won’t we need an overwhelmingly decisive element? <br /> <br />“Or rather, first of all─” <br /> <br />…Hm? …… What? <br /> <br />What the? I unconsciously muttered something weird just now. <br /> <br />What is it anyway? …………………………………………………… No, I don’t know. <br /> <br />But this unpleasant feeling is…the same discomfort I felt when we parted last Sunday. <br /> <br />What is it…? Just what’s bugging me? <br /> <br />“I want to help somehow, even indirectly… Do your best, Tera-san!” <br /> <br />While I mulled it over, positive Ohana waved enthusiastically at Awayuki on stage.  <br /> <br />“Um… By the way, Awayuki-san… What exactly are you eating?” <br /> <br />Nom nom “Dumplings. They prepared my favorite since you can’t cry on an empty stomach. And on this side, there’s also some black tea… Nom nom… The combination of dumplings and Earl Grey is just sublime.” <br /> <br />“W-well… You’re certainly enjoying yourself.” <br /> <br />“Oh, Ohana-chan is waving at us! Yay!” <br /> <br />A bit too carefree… <br /> <br />“Um, well… We have limited time, so I’d like to start! Now, entry number one: Shima kun from Class 3-6!” <br /> <br />“Oh dear. It started before I could even take a sip of Earl Grey. It’s not polite to eat or drink during the performances, so I’ll have to wait until the break.” <br /> <br />Don’t pick and choose when to have that odd sense of etiquette… No really, eat the dango beforehand… <br /> <br />“As some of you may know already, Shima-kun has the school’s number one beautiful voice, and is also our broadcasting club’s esteemed recitation expert. Please look forward to the tale his mature, composed voice will weave today─[Little Red Riding Hood]!” <br /> <br />C’mon, high schoolers crying over a picture book aside from Ohana─</p>


<p>“Ah, owing to his outstanding recitation skill, numerous sniffling voices can be heard from the crowd!” <br /> <br />No way… <br /> <br />“I-I too am on the verge of tearing up a little!”  <br /> <br />It really is amazing… The quality of his vocal tone, pacing, emotional expression, everything seems beyond high school level. <br /> <br />But… <br /> <br />“However! Despite that, Awayuki-san’s expression hasn’t so much as twitched behind her ironclad defense! Unfortunately, the time limit has been reached, so Shima-kun’s challenge ends in failure! Will a challenger who can break through this sturdy fortress appear!?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />In conclusion, no such challenger appeared.  <br /> <br />Not with the Tear Research Club’s tearjerking show. <br /> <br />Nor the science club’s gentle onion extract water pistol. <br /> <br />Not even with the dead serious no-comedy [When You’re Feeling Down] relatable comedy. <br /> <br />Nor the sumo club captain’s tearful hair cutting ceremony. <br /> <br />“And so, even the theatrical club members thought to have the best shot are soundly defeated! Awayuki-san’s tear ducts are just too sturdy!” <br /> <br />Even the elite of Teio academy Academy gathering talent from across Japan couldn’t shake Awayuki’s emotions. <br /> <br />As expected, making Awayuki cry through normal means is─ <br /> <br />“The students’ attempts have all ended in failure, but… Let’s change things up a little here. Look forward to this! A special challenge from Brain Seeker!” <br /> <br />Brain Seeker… Isn’t that the Brain Seeker? <br /> <br />A world leading mega-corporation at the forefront of brain science research, achieving groundbreaking results in education, medicine, sports science─and various other fields. <br /> <br />“Some of you may know already, but since Awayuki Tera-san enrolled, our school has partnered with Brain Seeker. Her brain holds tremendous potential of interest to the world’s top class corporation─and for Awayuki-san today, Brain Seeker has brought an astonishing research result!” <br /> <br />Following the Emcee’s declaration, a foreign man in a suit holding a tray in both hands appeared from the wing.  <br /> <br />On the white cloth covering the tray, something small seemed to be placed─ <br /> <br />“It may be hard to see from the crowd, but inside this capsule is a special medicine Brain Seeker developed using cutting-edge technology, just to make Awayuki-san cry! A prodigiously talented girl having her innermost feelings drawn out by a world-leading corporation… As the director said, we may be witnessing a historic moment!” <br /> <br />“Wha…” <br /> <br />I wasn’t the only one who let out a surprised gasp. The entire venue was suddenly filled with murmurs. <br /> <br />“I understand your concerns, everyone. It does seem a bit suspicious, doesn’t it? Honestly, I feel the same way! However, there’s no need to worry! The development is by Brain Seeker, of all people. We’re not trying entirely unknown technology here. We’ve actually adapted a treatment drug used for patients with certain brain dysfunctions due to accidents or congenital factors, customized for Awayuki-san. It stimulates and acts on the specific part of the brain responsible for emotions, safely and securely eliciting Awayuki-san’s tears! Of course, Brain Seeker has obtained approval for its use in Japan through the proper channels. And, to ensure everything goes smoothly, we have an observer from the headquarters, Chief Researcher Mr. Nono-Shiwaoi here with us!” <br /> <br />“Hey, boys and girls, good day!” <br /> <br />The introduced blond gentleman released his hand from the tray and waved cheerfully to the audience. <br /> <br />“Today is a historic day when the future partner of our company, Tera, gets her wish granted. The timing of the approval coinciding with this event seems like destiny to me. Now, through the tablets, monitor along with the CEO, and become witnesses to this legendary moment!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Whoa… Things just got serious all of a sudden.”<br />“Yeah… Brain Seeker getting involved like this, it’s way beyond a student’s level.”<br />“The CEO… That guy’s a regular on the Forbes billionaire list, right?… And he’s watching this?!”<br />“Awayuki-san is truly amazing…”<br />“If it’s Brain Seeker-made, then the safety shouldn’t be a problem.”<br />“That’s right. This could finally make Awayuki-san’s wish come true!” <br /> <br /> <br /> </p>



<p>“No, it’s impossible…” <br /> <br />Unconsciously, I muttered those words. <br /> <br />Certainly, this wasn’t the usual way. <br /> <br />This might actually be able to elicit Awayuki’s tears. <br /> <br />But this… was different. <br /> <br />It couldn’t be done with medicine. <br /> <br />Awayuki’s first tears in her life should be something natural, brought about by the stirring of her emotions, not something artificial. <br /> <br />Brain Seeker’s intervention was undoubtedly something Awayuki was aware of. If she agreed to it herself, there was no place for me to interfere as an outsider. <br /> <br />It was pure arrogance. <br /> <br />But… <br /> <br />This way, Awayuki wouldn’t feel the true essence of living. <br /> <br />Gulp <br /> <br />My legs naturally headed toward the tent right beside the stage─the executive committee headquarters for this [Make Awayuki Tera Cry] event. <br /> <br />“Um, sorry for the sudden request, but you’re the executive committee chairman, right?” <br /> <br />Spotting the intended person was easy due to the armband imprinted with his title.  <br /> <br />“Yes, that’s me, but…” <br /> <br />The somewhat nervous-looking boy pushed up his glasses with a <em>kui</em>. <br /> <br />“Is there any way to stop Awayuki from taking that medicine?” <br /> <br />“Ha? …Just what are you talking about?” <br /> <br />“I just…have a bad feeling about it. Like it’ll have the opposite effect of awakening Awayuki’s emotions…” <br /> <br />“A feeling? Seems like? And you want me to obstruct the great Brain Seeker’s activities based on such uncertain grounds?” <br /> <br />“Then, please contact someone with the authority to─” <br /> <br />“Did you call for me, Ootomo Youta?” <br /> <br />A familiar gruff voice called out from behind.  <br /> <br />“Huh? …The head teacher?” <br /> <br />With his usual oppressive aura bordering on a joke, head teacher Kongouji stood legs planted firmly apart. <br /> <br />“W-Why are you here?” <br /> <br />“Is it so odd for the person responsible for campus to inspect the executive committee during a school event? I should be asking you that very question, you rascal.” <br /> <br />G-Good point… But there’s no need to be so intense about it… This guy really hates me after all, huh. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“More importantly, I thought I heard some nonsense about stopping Brain Seeker from you… Surely you don’t mean that seriously.” <br /> <br />Uu…nghh… Just his glare makes my knees shake. <br /> <br />“I’m serious. That medicine won’t benefit Awayuki.” <br /> <br />But I clearly told head teacher Kongouji so while staring back into his eyes. <br /> <br />“Spouting idiocies just to make a fool of yourself is one thing, but trying to foolishly disturb order is another… As expected, your existence is unnecessary for this academy.” <br /> <br />The head teacher continued, not even trying to hide his overflowing anger. <br /> <br />“This is also a prime promotion opportunity for Brain Seeker. Something on this level won’t be stopped so readily. If word gets out that the famous Brain Seeker resolved that gifted Awayuki Tera’s troubles, it’ll be global news.” <br /> <br />“Promotion…? You’d…for something so trivial…” <br /> <br />“……Trivial?” <br /> <br />head teacher Kongouji’s voice changed to one resonating as if from the depths of the earth.  <br /> <br />“Listen up, boy. Do you think the comfortable environment you enjoy─clean school buildings with AC, abundant facilities like the latest PCs and club gear, special classes taught by top experts in every field─can be covered by tuition alone? It’s our job to provide an environment where students can focus on developing their talents. A brat who doesn’t know the first thing about management has no business complaining.” <br /> <br />“Uu…” <br /> <br />“Not only that… Seems I’m being misunderstood, but I repeatedly stressed safety first to Brain Seeker when requesting they develop this. And you think I’m the kind of man who’d endanger students for money!? Are you kidding me!?” <br /> <br />He’s gone full yakuza… <br /> <br />But my intuition tells me─I can’t back down here.  <br /> <br />“If you won’t listen to reason then I’ll go on stage directly and─ ugah!?” <br /> <br />I was suddenly locked in a vise-like hold from behind. <br /> <br />“Don’t try anything unnecessary.”  <br /> <br />“L-Let me go, head teacher!” <br /> <br />“Oh, just to be clear, this isn’t corporal punishment. It’s educational guidance for a student being uncooperative with an official school event.” <br /> <br />“Gu…rrrrrrrr!” <br /> <br />No good… He’s way too strong, I can’t struggle properly! <br /> <br />Meanwhile, on stage─  <br /> <br />“Now, Research Director Shiwaoi will hand the capsule to Awayuki-san. A talented girl solving her problems with the power of a global corporation… This may be a historic moment, as the director said!” <br /> <br />Crap… Awayuki! <br /> <br />Dammit…! I have to get on that stage no matter what─! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose ] <br /> <br />1 Escape the head teacher with the momentum of force of a fart rocket <br /> <br />or <br /> <br />2 Fart uncontrollably, leading to an accidental bowel movement <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“We’re in a dead serious scene, goddammit!” <br /> <br />Besides, what the hell’s a fart rocket!? <br /> <br />The meaning of 1 is lost on me… Meanwhile somehow I understand option 2, but please don’t make explain further <br /> <br />Damn it… <br /> <br />Reluctantly, I chose option 1… <br /> <br />And at that moment— <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />BRAAAAAP……… <br /> <br /> </p>





<p><br /> <br />“Uwaaaaaaaaah!” <br /> <br />With a sudden sense of weightlessness, my body slipped through the head teacher’s arms and was thrown into the air. <br /> <br />“I-I’m falling!” <br /> <br />Then, tracing a parabolic arc, I started to descend— <br /> <br />“Now, pay attention, as Awayuki-san is about to put the capsule into her mouth—” <br /> <br />Splat! <br /> <br />I crash-landed on the stage. <br /> <br />“Huh?” “What?” “What just happened?” <br /> <br />Amidst the sea of question marks in the audience, I lay on my stomach, twitching uncontrollably. <br /> <br />“…Daikyō-kun?” <br /> <br />“A-Awayuki…” <br /> <br />Ouch… I can’t believe I was launched all the way here like this… <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“What on earth happened here? I-It looked like someone just fell from the sky to me, but…” <br /> <br />Yes, a person suddenly fell from the sky. The propulsion was a fart, but whatever.  <br /> <br />I shakily stand up… Luckily, doesn’t seem I was seriously injured. <br /> <br />“Ah… In all the confusion, I momentarily forgot, but what about the medicine? …Awayuki-san, were you able to take the medicine properly?” <br /> <br />“No… It probably went into Ootomo-kun’s mouth as he was shouting and falling…” <br /> <br />“Huh? No wonder my mouth feels kinda weird─” <br /> <br /><em>Gulp</em> <br /> <br />“Oh………………………………………………………………I swallowed it.” <br /> <br />The next moment─  <br /> <br />“Hm?” <br /> <br />Turbulent emotions overflowed as if a dam burst, and <br /> <br />“Uu…uuu…sob…hic…ah…uuu…uwaaaaaaah!” <br /> <br />I laid on my back, flailing about bawling like a baby. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />(((((What the…this guy… oh no.))))) <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The crowd’s thoughts probably synchronized something like that, then─  <br /> <br />“Whaaaaaaat did you doooooooooo!” <br /> <br />The Emcee’s agonized voice roared. <br /> <br />“Waaaaah…sob…” <br /> <br />“We’re the ones who wanna cry here! Or rather, the school! This must’ve been a huge project requiring massive funding and time…!” <br /> <br />Well, with something like that said, head teacher Kongouji will surely be furious─ <br /> </p>



<p>” ” ” ” ” ………… ” ” ” ” ” <br /> </p>



<p>Glancing at the tent below the stage, the demon head teacher was sleeping peacefully with the executive committee members. Thank goodness… Looks like they fainted from the fart rocket’s awful smell… No wait, nothing good about that! <br /> <br />What do I do… What do I do!?  <br /> <br />Suddenly barging in and ruining a global corporation’s research results… We’re way past just standing out! <br /> <br />As I wiped the tears welling in my eyes, I gingerly stood up.  <br /> <br />“Just who are… Huh, Ootomo Youta!?” <br /> <br />“Huh? Why do you know my name?” <br /> <br />“Wh-Why wouldn’t I know the name of the super problem child who picked a fight with [Houjou] right after enrolling!? I don’t know the details, but word even has it you somehow neatly wrapped up the situation with some perverted method!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Oh yeah, I’ve heard that rumor before.”<br />“Him?”<br />“But he looks pretty normal, doesn’t he?”<br />“Idiot, the really dangerous guys don’t look sketchy.”<br />“I hear he wears his mom’s panties to school and stuff.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Let’s not dig that back up! <br /> <br />No no no, this is bad! Bad bad bad! If a rumor like this was circulating the whole school, there’s no way I could keep living normally… I have to explain somehow! <br /> <br />“C-Could I use the mic?  <br /> <br />“Ah, yes…” <br /> <br />Senior Kurosu reluctantly fitted a lapel mic on me… Alright, this is the moment of truth! <br /> <br />“Everyone, I’m Ootomo Yota from Year 2, Class 1. A number of… coincidences have led me here, but this isn’t my intention. Ah, before that, let me first explain. It seems some baseless rumors have spread about me wearing my mother’s underwear, but the truth is─” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />【Choose 】 <br /> <br />1 Shout your mother’s name while posing in a Y shape  <br /> <br />2 Shout your father’s name while posing legs spread in an M shape <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Ootomo Sota!” <br /> <br />Th-Thank goodness… If it was his stage name Hoshi Toru it’d be found out instantly, but his real name should be fine. <br /> <br />“Um, Oootmo-kun… Who’s this Ootomo Sota?” <br /> <br />“Ah, my dad.” <br /> <br />“So in other words… To appeal that it’s not your mother’s but your father’s underwear you wear, you shouted his name while spreading your legs in an M shape?” <br /> <br />Nothing was resolved and there’s only more problems! <br /> <br />“N-No! My actions just now were unrelated, I simply had a spontaneous urge to shout my dad’s name while posing legs spread in an M for some reason!” <br /> <br />That just makes me sound like a freak too! <br /> <br />No…the more I talk, the deeper I dig my grave… <br /> <br />“Ahem… Well, let’s pretend we didn’t see that just now… Ootomo-kun, why exactly did you make this outrageous disruption?” <br /> <br />“Ah, well, about that…” <br /> <br />I should just brush it off and get off the stage here. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />【Choose 】 <br /> <br />1 Do a “Sexy Fish” one-liner gag <br /> <br />2 Do a “Sexy Fish Holding an Erotic Cat” one-liner gag <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Even Sazae-san would stop following you for that! <br /> <br />Damn… This crap choice mechanic, every single time… Dammit! <br /> <br />…I laid down on the stage floor and arched my upper body back. <br /> <br />“Twitch twitch twitch!

Twitchy bitch!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />” ” ” ” ” …………………………… ” ” ” ” ” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Silence engulfed the crowd. <br /> <br />“Um… Ootomo-kun…err…well…” <br /> <br />Even the pro Emcee was at a loss for words after the sudden one-liner. Amidst that─ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“C’mon man, that’s going too far.”<br />“Yeah, simply unpleasant.”<br />“Poor Awayuki…”<br />“Disrespectful to everyone seriously participating so far too.”<br />“Cut it out! Get lost!”<br />“Yeah, yeah!”<br />“Go home, Ootomo!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Boos targeting me were leaking from the crowd. <br /> <br />Certainly from an outsider’s perspective, it would look like I’m making a fool of Awayuki, Brain Seeker, and everyone here. <br /> <br />Amidst the headwind blowing against me─ <br /> </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Once again, the venue was wrapped in anger-filled silence. <br /> <br />N-No good… If this explodes, it’ll be riot level─ <br /> <br /><em>Slip!</em> <br /> <br />“Gweh!” <br /> <br />I slipped on something and pitched forward. <br /> <br />Wh-What was that? Nothing on stage could’ve─ <br /> <br />“A…a banana peel?” <br /> <br />Thrown along with the jeers earlier? <br /> <br />Stepping on that precisely at a time like this… Of course my misfortune would activate.  <br /> <br />And not only falling, failing to break my fall, I banged my nose a bit awkwardly. <br /> <br />“Uu…Hm? Wh-What’s this?” <br /> <br />Something white on my wiped finger. Paint flecking from the floor stuck to my nose? No way something that normal could… Just how out of it am I right now. <br /> <br />While lamenting my misfortune─ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Enough already!”<br />“Disgraceful!”<br />“She’s not gonna cry just because you fell!”<br />“Waste of time!”<br />“Drag him off, staff!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The hate towards me was reaching its peak. <br /> <br />Wh-What do I do…? At this level, I can’t resolve it by escaping─ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Ah…uwaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaah!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />An ear-piercing yell echoed through the venue. <br /> <br />“W-What was that just now? …Who was it?” <br /> <br />Everyone’s gazes gathered on the person who made that sound. <br /> <br />“O-Houjou-san?” <br /> <br />Yes, the owner of that voice was Houjou Reina.  <br /> <br />“How…not again…again like this… But this has to be… No, I can think of nothing else… It must be that…” <br /> <br />Seemingly unaware she was the center of attention, Houjou mussed up her hair in frustration. <br /> <br />“I thought it was weird… There’s no way Ootomo would do something like this─ignore Awayuki-san’s feelings… Looks like I was right after all…” <br /> <br />“Um, Houjou-san… Sorry to interrupt your pondering, but…” <br /> <br />“Huh…?” <br /> <br />Only then did Houjou notice Senior Kurosu calling out to her. <br /> <br />“I’m sure everyone’s curious, but could you explain to us?” <br /> <br />“Oh, right… Of course you couldn’t notice something so absurd. Because it’s just so stupid… But having experienced it directly myself, I was somehow able to grasp his true intent.” <br /> <br />Then Houjou raised her voice to the students filling the venue. <br /> <br />“Then let me tell you. About his…Ootomo Youta’s grand plan!” <br /> <br />“Grand…plan?” <br /> <br />The grand …… Plan? <br /> <br />“Yes. First, to confirm, behind Awayuki-san today─there are massive amounts of red roses and chrysanthemums decorated, right? That’s natural for Teio academy, yes?” <br /> <br />“Yes. Those two are also Principal Ougami’s trademarks. The vibrant roses and chrysanthemums are a fixture at all our events and ceremonies.” <br /> <br />“That’s right. They’re also placed left and right on Awayuki-san’s table, so eye-catching. By the way Mr. Emcee, do you know the flower meanings of these two?” <br /> <br />Despite not using a mic, Houjou’s skilled orator voice carried very well. <br /> <br />“Yes… Red roses mean [Love], and red chrysanthemums mean [I love you]. Both tie into Principal Ougami Ai’s name… This is also a relatively well-known story around Teio academy.” <br /> <br />“Thank you. Now, here’s the gist. Actually, those two flower meanings─contained a message from Awayuki-san to all of us!” <br /> <br />“…What?” <br /> <br />The person herself beside me let out a small, questioning voice. She probably has absolutely no idea what this is about… Somehow this development feels so déjà vu. <br /> <br />“[Love] and [I love you]? Certainly fitting for kind Awayuki-san wishing for others’ happiness, but as a message, it doesn’t quite click…” <br /> <br />“I see… But, what you’re talking about takes on a completely different meaning because of something brought in by Awayuki-san’s will!” <br /> <br />“Something? What do you mean?” <br /> <br />Not only Kurosu senpai, but everyone in the audience seemed captivated by Hōjō’s speech. His ability to grasp people’s hearts was truly remarkable. <br /> <br />“It’s dumplings and tea!” <br /> <br />What came out of Hōjō’s mouth was an unexpected pair. It was prepared to suit Awayuki’s preferences, but… <br /> <br />“First, the dumplings. These were placed on the right side as we face it… Yes, next to the chrysanthemums on the table. Dumplings and chrysanthemums… together, it’s ‘Dangogiku.'” <br /> <br />“‘Dangogiku’? …Honestly, that’s the first time I’ve heard that word.” <br /> <br />“Yes, it is. The Japanese name isn’t… No, even the scientific name may not be that well-known. The Japanese name ‘Dangogiku’ refers to the name of the flower, which is… Helianthus.” <br /> <br />“Helianthus…?” <br /> <br />“Yes. And the flower language of this Helianthus is ‘tears.'” <br /> <br />“‘Tears’… I see. That’s indeed the theme of today…” <br /> <br />“That’s right. Now, think back to Awayuki-san’s actions at the beginning of the meeting. She quickly devoured the prepared dumplings. That means, at the moment the ‘Dangogiku’ turned into just chrysanthemums—it ceased to be ‘tears.’ In other words, Awayuki-san showed us that the true purpose of this meeting is not ‘tears’!” <br /> <br />“W-What?!” <br /> <br />W-What?! <br /> <br />“Well, Hōjō-san, isn’t that a bit of a stretch…?” <br /> <br />I think so too. <br /> <br />“While that might be the case with just that, right after Awayuki-san finished the dumplings, she called out, ‘Ohana-chan, yay!’ This is referring to Mihaneya Getsuka-san form my class, her nickname is Ohana-chan’s and ‘Hana’ means ‘flower.’ She spoke to a flower… That indicated that ‘flower language’ is the keyword!” <br /> <br />“W-What?! I thought she was just being overly casual, but…” <br /> <br />“No, I just talked to Ohana-chan like I normally do…” <br /> <br />Awayuki’s murmurs were completely drowned out by Kurosu senpai’s loud exclamation.</p>



<p>“Hey…what do you think?”<br />“Well, still feels kinda forced…”<br />“But it’s that Houjou saying it, man.”<br />“Yeah…somehow each word feels kinda persuasive.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The crowd seems half skeptical… I think you should be more skeptical. <br /> <br />“Here’s the crucial part. The roses were placed to our left from the table, right? And next to them was Earl Grey. Britain’s most famous tea. Combine Britain and roses, and the flower that comes to mind is…the English rose!” <br /> <br />“Could its meaning…also hold some significance?” <br /> <br />“You guessed it. Feel free to look it up on your phones, everyone.” <br /> <br />Following Houjou’s skillful prompting, everyone did as she said─ <br /> <br />“Ahhhhh!!” <br /> <br />Along with Senior Kurosu, surprised voices echoed through the crowd. <br /> <br />“Th-The English rose’s meaning is…a smile!” <br /> <br />“That’s right! And Awayuki-san didn’t drink the tea. She erased the tears and left the smile… In other words! Awayuki-san’s true intent wasn’t to cry…it was to laugh!” <br /> <br />“…What did you sayyyyyyyyy!?” <br /> <br />Amidst the venue’s shock, Awayuki whispered to me. <br /> <br />“Ootomo-kun…just what is that Houjou person saying?”  <br /> <br />Yeah, I’m wondering that myself, but…with all these coincidences and twists, it somehow feels persuasive… Houjou’s skill at capturing hearts is bolstering it tremendously.  <br /> <br />“Then how were you able to notice a message as cryptic as this, Houjou-san?” <br /> <br />“No, I wouldn’t have figured it out with just that. The catalyst was Ootomo-kun’s actions…that pratfall after the hototogisu pun…that’s when it hit me!” <br /> <br />“Huh? …I’m completely lost on the meaning…” <br /> <br />“At first I had the wrong idea too. I thought that hototogisu referred to the bird.” <br /> <br />“Did it…not?” <br /> <br />Did it…not? <br /> </p>



<p>“There is in fact a lesser known flower called the hototogisu.”  <br /> <br />“A flower…so another flower meaning?” <br /> <br />“That’s right. But that alone is still incomplete. There’s a subspecies of hototogisu called the shiobanahototogisu. After the hototogisu pun, Ootomo intentionally fell to turn his nose─the flower white, subtly indicating the shiobanahototogisu.” <br /> <br />“Sh-Shiobanahototogisu… What does that one mean?” <br /> <br />“[Hidden feelings].” <br /> <br />“─!?” <br /> <br />“Despite openly saying she wants to cry, Awayuki must have circumstances where she can’t openly say her true desire is to laugh. But Ootomo noticed right away. However, since it goes against the person’s own wishes, he can’t explain that to everyone─so! He was showing it through action! No matter how much booing or vilification he received…He was fighting alone to make Awayuki smile! Sending her the message [I alone have noticed your hidden desire─to laugh]!  <br /> </p>



<p>” ” ” ” ” Wha… ” ” ” ” <br /> </p>



<p>Everyone’s eyes opened wide as they were rendered speechless.  <br /> <br />Wha… <br /> <br />Then I was rendered speechless as well. <br /> <br />The bird poop and pratfall lined up way too perfectly… For it to activate in a place like this… <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Ootomo kept it secret this far, so for me to just blab is the height of boorishness! But I couldn’t stay silent after realizing… A gallant man’s actions going unacknowledged… I won’t allow it!” <br /> <br />Then Houjou pointed sharply at Awayuki on stage.  <br /> <br />“And Awayuki-san! Whether you have reasons or not, you needn’t hide wanting to laugh! Call me arrogant and deny it, I don’t care! But Ootomo─this man has thrown himself away with actions! Please…please accept it!” <br /> <br />Then Houjou spread her arms wide to the crowd filling the venue.  <br /> <br />“Right…everyone!?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />” ” ” ” ” Th-That’s rightttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttttt! ” ” ” ” ” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />No, none of that’s right!  <br /> <br />Are you an idiot, Houjou? Are Teio academy students idiots? Even just thinking normally, it’s clearly too forced! Don’t just get swept up in the mood! <br /> <br />“What exactly is that Houjou person saying?” <br /> <br />Awayuki’s overly reasonable tsukkomi is completely drowned out by the crowd’s cheers, audible only to me.  <br /> <br />** “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” **</p>

<p>Stoooooop that Ootomo yell! I don’t wanna stand out at allllll! </p>

<p> <br />“W-Wait everyone! I’m not that amazing a guy! I do truly want to help Awayuki, but Houjou’s conjecture is an over-interpretation. I’m really just ordinary and norm─” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />【Choose 】 <br /> <br />1 Upper body clothes normally rip off <br /> <br />2 Lower body clothes normally rip off <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />That’s not how you use “normally”! Are you some messed up gyaru!? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />【Choose 】 <br /> <br />1 Like It’s pretty normal for my upper body to Like naked but Like it’s funny LOL <br /> <br />2 Like It’s pretty normal for my lower body to Like naked but it’s gross eww <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Don’t just rephrase it in gyaru-speak! And in 2, using “gross” is weird!  <br /> <br />Don’t make the messed up language even more messy! <br /> <br />Oh, damn it… Why is my fate in the hands of this jesting dude(?)… <br /> <br />While gritting my teeth, I begrudgingly selected 1─ <br /> <br />Paan! <br /> <br />With a somewhat ominous sound, my upper body clothing ripped off.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Whoa!?”<br />“Wh-Why so suddenly…”<br />“I-Is it magic…? Amazing mobility…”<br />“No, before how it was done, why’s that guy suddenly stripping!?”<br />“Ma-Maybe he really is a freak…” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Well, good the excessive hype died down, but standing out for no reason is meaningless… <br /> <br />There were various misunderstandings, but in the end he was just a normal guy, and he quietly fades off the stage─that would’ve been ideal─ <br /> <br />“Goddamn!” <br /> <br />When suddenly, an angry voice reverberated.  <br /> <br />It belonged to─ <br /> <br />“Ya done it, boy…our CEO is damn pissed.” <br /> <br />Brain Seeker Lead Researcher, Dr. Nono Shiwaoi. <br /> <br />The cheerful, gentle expression from earlier was nowhere to be found. Dr. Shiwaoi glared at me with an extremely stern face. <br /> <br />Th-That’s right… I ended up drinking the medicine they developed for Awayuki… No idea why he got angry now of all times, but in any case, I gotta apologize! <br /> <br />“I-I’m so sorryyyy! I can’t undo what happened, but I absolutely didn’t drink it intentionally─” <br /> <br />“Seems ya misunderstood somethin’, boy. The CEO’s a very tolerant man. He won’t get upset over unintentional accidents. In the first place, that medicine─we didn’t bring any expensive spares today, but can replicate it easily. If Teio academy buys more from us, it’s even better for my company.”  <br /> <br />It’s not about the medicine? …Then why in the world is he so─ <br /> <br />“It’s yer nipples! Back when the CEO tried nipple laundry peg sumo wrestlin’ himself on YouTube, he got banned and now can’t even look at men’s nipples without puking!” <br /> <br />What the hell is your boss doing!? And that’s clearly just picking a fight! Far from tolerant, he’s way too narrow-minded!  <br /> <br />“The CEO is showin’ strong disdain for you─and by extension, Teio academy Academy for allowing your enrollment. He’ll continue the personal contract with Tera, but cut all other ties with this school from now on─namely, pullin’ sponsorships!” <br /> <br />“Wha…Th-That’s ridiculous! The head of a huge corporation shouldn’t sabotage business over personal feelings─” <br /> <br />“No. The CEO built his fortune by following his instincts, a super-sensory genius. No matter who says what, he won’t deal at all with someone his gut rejects.” <br /> <br />No way… Because of me, Teio academy Academy will… Th-There’s no way I can take responsibility for this. <br /> <br />“Th-This is awful…truly awful… To be frank, this is beyond us students’ capabilities… H-head teacher, what should we…” <br /> <br />Senior Kurosu turned an imploring gaze toward the stage below, but─  <br /> <br />” ” ” ” ” …………………… ” ” ” ” ”  <br /> <br />The head teacher was still in peaceful slumber. <br /> <br />“Tch… Ch-Principal Ougami!? Is Principal Ougami here!?” <br /> <br />But no voice responded to Senior Kurosu’s call.  <br /> <br />That person could probably resolve this, but why aren’t they here at such an important time!? <br /> <br />“If deterioration of relations with us spreads, this academy’s worldwide credibility will hit rock bottom. Same goes for Ougami Ai’s centripetal force. Plans she firmly refused like having Tera skip grades and transfer to our partner university could also now be executed.” <br /> <br />Cr-Crap crap crap! Wh-What do we do─!? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Splat! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />A bird turd suddenly fell from the sky. <br /> <br />Its landing spot─naturally, was my body. <br /> <br />At a time like this… Just how out of it am I!? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Splat! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />A-Another one!? …There are limits to even the wo─  <br /> <br />“Goddamn!” <br /> <br />When suddenly, an angry voice reverberated. <br /> <br />“You did it, boy. …… Our CEO is very angry. <br /> <br />Dr. Shiwaoi’s rage flaring again… Oh, it’s over… The possibility of turning this around now is─zero.  <br /> <br />To the god who didn’t gift me this miracle.” <br /> <br />“Huh…?” <br /> <br />“Whatcha dumbfounded for, boy! Both yer chests now clearly bear the scars of the birds’ rudeness right!?” <br /> <br />Certainly they landed precisely on my chest, but what’s that have to do with anything!? <br /> <br />“Meanin’ both yer nipples are completely hidden! No way YouTube ops bans for that! The CEO’s givin’ ya a standin’ ovation on the other side of the screen for erasin’ his disgrace like this!”  <br /> <br />Why!? <br /> <br />“And the CEO’s a decisive man. He’ll now provide the Tera medicine you drank and the spares to be made completely free─and said to drastically increase sponsor fees to Teio academy Academy!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />” ” ” ” ” Whoaaaaaaaaaaaa that’s craaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaazy! ” ” ” ” ” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />No way, it’s crazy! I’m just super unlucky!  <br /> <br />Clothes ripping off x2 + bird poop = CEO super angry, but then again… <br /> </p>



<p>** “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” ** <br /> </p>



<p>So stop the callllll! <br /> <br />Even looking at it normally as a plus, for me who wants no attention it can only be a negative. <br /> <br />“Op-Open your eyes, everyone!” <br /> <br />But now that it’s come to this, denying it will likely be counterproductive… Here, I have to ask someone unaffected by the mood with persuasive power to speak.  <br /> <br />“Ah, Awayuki… Please, explain properly to everyone.” <br /> <br />With things this disrupted, there’s no way even Awayuki can cry. <br /> <br />“Yeah, I got it. Hey everyone, listen up for a sec. What Mr. Hōjō was saying earlier was just a crazy coincidence combined with exaggeration. I really just want to cry, that’s all.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Huh? Wasn’t it that you actually wanted to laugh instead?”  </p>


<p>“Alright! The atmosphere in the room has even pushed back the skepticism. Go for it, Awayuki!” <br /> <br />“To all the participants, thank you so much for your hard work. Everything was wonderful, but Shima-kun’s reading and the Drama Club’s play were particularly outstanding. Many people in the audience were crying. But I couldn’t follow that up. Even with all that effort put into it, I couldn’t move my emotions… But watching everyone’s tears from the stage, it was really beautiful. I want to experience that kind of emotion and cry with you all… That’s all.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“…Hey, you’ve said all this, so don’t you want to cry after all?” <br /> <br />“Yeah… I think I do.” <br /> <br />“That Drama Club performance was really something.” <br /> <br />“Yes, it was incredibly moving!” <br /> <br />“Yeah… I thought it might be a comedy because of the name, but I never expected to be moved by a play titled ‘Impatience of Paint and Toilets.'” <br /> <br />“Indeed, they’re a Drama Club that regularly participates in national competitions!” <br /> <br />“But it’s true, not being able to cry at all after that is kind of sad…” <br /> <br />“Yeah, in a way, I can understand why someone might want to rely on Brain Seeker’s unconventional medicine.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Yes! Using the drama club’s play as a jumping off point, the tides are turning! <br /> <br />It really was amazing huh, that play.  <br /> <br />It was about the conflict between a painter who wants to paint everything green and a toilet artisan pursuing the ultimate clean toilet. From their heated argument to the reconciliation. Working together, they completed a green and clean toilet seat in a tear-jerking finale – I bet they could charge admission and no one would complain, that’s how fantastic the production quality was.  <br /> <br />Glancing offstage, I notice the props from that play still sitting there.  <br /> <br />The can of paint, and the vivid green toilet it had been used to color. Who would’ve thought these two items could create such a moving world –  <br /> </p>



<p>[Choose ] <br /> <br />1 The paint can falls over and the contents spill out in a gag manga style slip.  <br /> <br />2 Get in the toilet and be transported to another world. Become the demon lord and conquer the world. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />What do you mean go to a completely different world!?  <br /> <br />And getting sent to another world after getting flushed down a toilet!? That’s not normal, it should be getting hit by a truck or something! <br /> <br />No, no way…I know we’ve had some absurd choices so far but there’s no way something like getting transported to another world could really…could really happen, probably.  <br /> <br />The moment I reluctantly pick 1 using pure process of elimination –  <br /> <br />Thud!  <br /> <br />I hear a paint can fall over backstage.  <br /> <br />And as if aimed right at me, the green paint comes oozing towards me. <br /> <br />No no no. There’s no way it would just conveniently come sliding at me like some manga… <br /> <br /><em>Slip!</em> <br /> <br />Before I knew it, I was sliding just like in a manga.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Hey, what’s with that guy…he slipped just like in a manga!”<br />“He fell perfectly on the back of his head like a manga!”<br />“It looked like his eyes popped out all manga-style for a second…but that can’t be real right, just my imagination?”<br />“I saw it too…but there’s no way something so manga-like could happen, it was just in my head right?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />This is bad. The mood is shifting in a comedic direction again. <br /> <br />I’m all sticky and gross covered in green paint but that’s the least of my worries…I have to do something! <br /> <br />“Everyone, listen. My slipping just now was on pur-<em>Slip!</em>” <br /> <br />Before I knew it, I was sliding just like in a manga again. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Hey, he’s joking around right?”<br />“Yeah, he’s joking.”<br />“He’s obviously joking.”<br />“Looks 100% like a joke no matter how you look at it.”<br />“Which means-“<br />“So Awayuki, you really do want to laugh after all?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Noooooo! <br /> <br />“…”  <br /> <br />Awayuki is giving me a piercing, accusatory stare. S-Sorry… <br /> <br />But no amount of excuses from me will get me out of this hole now. I hate to do this but…I’ll have to leave it to her to salvage this herself! <br /> <br />“W-Wait Awayuki, that’s not right is it? Tell everyone your true feelings again!” <br /> <br />“Yes, everyone, like I said before, let me reaffirm – my true wish is–” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><em>Slip!</em> <em>Snip!</em> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Ahh!” <br /> <br />I suddenly slip on something and fall over. <br /> <br />The b-banana peel from the choices earlier huh…after slipping there, now more bad luck makes me slip again…wait, slip I understand but snip? What’s that snipping sound? <br /> <br />“Ahhhhh!?” <br /> <br />M-My hair…the side of my head is shaved! Why is this happening!? <br /> <br />The culprit was the trimmer used in the sumo club captain’s hair cutting ceremony.  <br /> <br />Hold on…I slipped on a banana peel, coincidentally landed on an electric trimmer left on the ground which somehow got turned on when my body hit it, and as I moved the side of my head got <em>snip</em> snipped…that’s astronomically bad luck at this point! <br /> </p>



<p>The razor-sharp cut gave me an absurd spiky upright hairstyle…But wait, who cares about my hair right now!  <br /> <br />I had interrupted Awayuki just as she was about to reveal her true wish. I need to let her finish speaking quickly! <br /> <br />I made eye contact with Awayuki and she gave a small nod.  <br /> <br />Alright! Please tell everyone how you really feel after saying “My true wish is–“! <br /> <br />However, Awayuki turned her gaze to my freshly green-tinted spiky hair and uttered a single phrase. <br /> <br />“It looks like grass is growing.”<br />T\N : 草 = grass = wwwww = wara wara =japanese laugh <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“She said grass grew thereeeeee!” </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p> <br /> <br /> <br />“Wha—? You’ve got to be kidding me!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“But, Awayuki-san, you wanted to laugh after all!”<br />“Yeah, but she can’t directly say I want to laugh for some reason.”<br />“That’s right! And who made it possible for her to smoothly say that?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />It’s not me! I didn’t do it!  <br /> <br />How does green paint plus trimmer equals grass!? That’s just idiotic! <br /> <br />Damn! Because of me, the mood has gone in the complete opposite direction of Awayuki’s real desire… <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Now there’s no more room for doubt!”  <br /> <br />“Right! We just need to create an atmosphere where Awayuki can laugh easily!”</p>



<p>“Let’s get pumped!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Huh? But wait, this is… <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Mr. Hōjō is right! There’s no reason you need to hide wanting to laugh!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“That’s right Awayuki, feel free to laugh happily!”  <br /> <br />“We’re all on your side here!” <br /> <br />“Yeah, it’s time to return the favor for everything you’ve done for us!” <br /> <br />“Come on everyone, be louder!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />*** “Awayuki!” “Awayuki!” “Awayuki!” ***</p>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>“Ha…ha…” <br /> <br />A small laugh escaped from me.  <br /> <br />Because I finally realized the strange feeling I’d had all this time. <br /> <br />“Awayuki?” <br /> <br />The answer was so simple. <br /> <br />“You’re really loved by everyone here, aren’t you?” <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“There’s no way you can cry in this kind of atmosphere. Yes…I think you should give up on that, Awayuki.” <br /> <br />“I don’t want to say this but…this excitement is almost entirely thanks to you. Telling me to give up is irresponsible.” <br /> <br />“You’re right, no, all of this is my fault. I’ll take responsibility.” <br /> <br />Just like before, Awayuki and my conversation was drowned out by the cheering and only audible to each other. <br /> <br />“Yeah. Please hurry and calm down this mood, I want an atmosphere where I can cry aga–” <br /> <br />“I’ll take responsibility and properly make you laugh, Awayuki.” <br /> <br />“What? Make me laugh? I don’t understand what you mean. That’s the opposite of my wish.” <br /> <br />“What is your wish, Awayuki?” <br /> <br />“Huh? You know already. I want to have emotions like other people too. The first emotional expression when humans are born is [crying]. Since I haven’t experienced that yet, my life has not begun in this world. If I don’t cry, my life will never start.” <br /> <br />Ah right, that American saying was supposed to come after that.  <br /> <br />I think it was something like “When you entered this world, you cried while everyone else laughed. So live your life so that when you leave this world, everyone cries while you laugh.” <br /> <br />It’s an incredibly good quote that I can totally relate to.  <br /> <br />But– <br /> <br />“It’s fine for some people to be born laughing.” <br /> <br />“That’s impossible. Biologically no such human exists.” <br /> <br />“They can. You’re [a new possibility in human evolution], aren’t you?” <br /> <br />“It’s not meant that way. You’re interpreting it too conveniently.” <br /> <br />“Haha, well doesn’t matter–” <br /> <br />“I’ll just do as I please over here.” <br /> <br />If Awayuki’s ultimate desire really is just [crying], I’d be happy to assist her.  <br /> <br />But that’s not it. What she wants is further beyond that. She wants those [emotions] so badly that she continues struggling ceaselessly. <br /> <br />“You seem different than before, why do you look so happy?” <br /> <br />Of course I do. <br /> <br />Even if it was born of [being moved], rather than that incomprehensible meeting trying to make everyone cry together to make one girl cry– <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“It’s obvious that making a girl smile would be more exciting.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />My body feels hot.  <br /> <br />My boiling blood races through my body. <br /> <br />In inverse proportion, my mental senses feel calmly and extremely sharp. <br /> <br />It was an omnipotence I had never experienced before.  <br /> <br />I had a strange certainty that just for this moment, even the worst, most awful choice wouldn’t activate. <br /> <br />Nothing would get in my way of– <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose]  <br /> <br />1 For a period of time, everything you think will becomes spoken words from your mouth. <br /> <br />2 For a period of time, all the titles of the adult magazines you are indebted to will becomes spoken words from your mouth <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Don’t get in my damn way! Wipe that smug look off your face! Anything more embarrassing than this!? <br /> <br />No, 2 is definitely hell! I’ll be exposed! My habits! <br /> <br />No way I can choose either one…1 is still the worst but…there’s a way to deal with it.  <br /> <br />I just have to maintain my consciousness and keep thinking of completely unrelated things. <br /> <br />1897593358975294300827445741859305897– <br /> <br />For example, just random number sequences like this. <br /> <br />Even if it interrupts the flow of making Awayuki laugh, I can restart after getting through the choices. <br /> <br />Hmm…so much for breaking through the choices. <br /> <br />I chose 1 and immediately started thinking of numbers. <br /> <br />“69382742589158377853037183283729921…” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“From overhead I suddenly heard a strange sound. I reflexively looked up and–what’s that? A baseball? The moment I realized that it was already–<em>smack!</em>” <br /> <br />Gobble! <br /> <br />“I was hit hard on the head and my consciousness faded–” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“What an unbelievable accident! A home run ball flew in from the neighboring baseball field and hit you…Are you okay!?” <br /> <br />“Yes, Kurosui senpai. I just feel a bit lightheaded. It hit my forehead after all.”  <br /> <br />“I-I see…but your pupils seem strangely vacant which concerns me…I mean, even before getting hit you suddenly started chanting numbers like an incantation and doing a sports commentary so that was pretty odd but…” <br /> <br />“I’m fine. As you can see I’m perfectly conscious right? If anything, I feel refreshingly straightforward. It’s like I’m directly saying everything on my mind.” <br /> <br />“I-Is that so…” <br /> <br />“Are you really okay? Just in case, we should get you to a hospital–” <br /> <br />“No, I’m seriously totally fine–anyway, Awayuki.” <br /> <br />“What?” <br /> <br />“You’re cute.” <br /> <br />“….Huh?” <br /> <br />You’re so cute. <br /> <br />…… You? <br /> <br />“You’re seriously so cute. I thought so the first time I saw you, this cuteness is inhuman.” <br /> <br />“Mr. Ootomo…kun?” <br /> <br />“I’m not joking around! I’m just speaking my true thoughts directly!”  <br /> <br />“……” <br /> <br />“But, it’s such a waste…I think Awayuki would be even cuter smiling!”  <br /> <br />“Um, Daikyou…kun, everyone can hear you know?” <br /> <br />“Who cares! Anyway everyone here thinks Awayuki would be a million times cuter smiling!” <br /> <br />“Uh, well…Daikyou kun…”  <br /> <br />“And isn’t it weird! Why can’t you laugh when you make everyone else smile! You who makes people happier than anyone should be the happiest one!” <br /> <br />“Yeah, well…so crying is the first step I want to take and–” <br /> <br />“Ah forget all that annoying stuff! Don’t overcomplicate it, just show me a cuter face than now!” <br /> <br />“Um…if you say cute cute so many times, it’s a little…” <br /> <br />“I’m just saying what I think! What’s wrong with that!” <br /> <br />“It’s not about right or wrong but…usually–” <br /> <br />“Look, Awayuki.”  <br /> <br />“Oh…gr, grabbing my shoulder like that…how bold…” <br /> <br />“You like making people smile right?” <br /> <br />“Y, yeah…” <br /> <br />“Know what would make everyone in the audience smile the most right now?” <br /> <br />“If I…laughed?” <br /> <br />“That’s right!” <br /> <br />“I, I get it logically but…impossible. I can feel everyone’s expectations but…I don’t know how to laugh…”  <br /> <br />“Then leave everyone for later! First, laugh for me!” <br /> <br />“…Huh?” <br /> <br />“Let me monopolize…your cute smile!” <br /> <br />“Um…that’s like, kinda already a pr, proposal…” <br /> <br />“I don’t know what you’re saying but you can do it! You can definitely be even cuter!” <br /> <br />“Uh…I, I think that’s enough…” <br /> <br />“Oh I get it! I just need to show you by example! Look, like this!” <br /> <br />“Oh….mmm…” <br /> <br />“What’s wrong? You’re averting your face. Did my smile seem weird?” <br /> <br />“No…it’s as wonderful as ever…I thought…”  <br /> <br />“I see…haha, thanks. So just imitate me. Can you do it?” <br /> <br />“Y…yes.” <br /> </p>



<p>“Ha…!”</p>



<p>My consciousness awakens. <br /> <br />Huh? What was I doing…I remember up until the baseball hitting me but…did I pass out for a bit maybe? <br /> <br />Looks like the [period of time] from the choice ended because thoughts aren’t coming out of my mouth anymore but…huh? Awayuki is right in front of me…but she’s facing straight down for some reason? Did I maybe do something while out…? <br /> <br />As I’m wondering that, Awayuki slowly lifts her face and– <br /> <br />“….Ehehe.”</p>

<p>“Ah, Awayuki you……………………………………………………….just now, lau–” <br /> <br />“She laugheddddddddd!”</p>


<p>The venue explodes with excitement. <br /> <br />“You saw right?…Hey, you saw right?”  <br /> <br />“Ah…Ah! Awayuki definitely laughed!” <br /> <br />“Alright!”  <br /> <br />“I’m so glad…so glad!” <br /> <br />“And isn’t Ootomo-kun crazy? That was just a normal confession!” <br /> <br />“Seriously…no one else could imitate that!” <br /> <br />“As expected, amazing!”</p>

<p>W-Why’s it turn out like this…did I actually not pass out and…do something weird instead? I stood out from start to finish didn’t I ahhhhhh! <br /> <br />“I…laughed?” <br /> <br />Clutching my head, I suddenly come to my senses hearing Awayuki’s voice. <br /> <br />“I can’t…believe it.”  <br /> <br />And from Awayuki’s vacant gaze– <br /> <br />“Oh…what?” <br /> <br />A single teardrop falls. <br /> <br />“Strange…it should be over already…even though I wished for it so much and nothing came out at all…why now, all of a sudden…” <br /> <br />It was proof that Awayuki could now express emotion outwardly.  <br /> <br />Because those tears that continued spilling nonstop showed no signs of stopping– <br /> <br />“But somehow…my chest feels warm.” <br /> <br />It was because Awayuki had laughed. <br /> <br />“Daikyou kun, thank you.”  <br /> <br />It shone brighter than any smile I had seen from anyone before. <br /> <br />“…No, I didn’t do anything.” <br /> <br />What actions my hazy consciousness took…I seriously can’t remember at all. <br /> <br />“Um, Daikyou kun…” <br /> <br />“What?” <br /> <br />Awayuki’s tears seem to have stopped but now she addresses me in an awkward manner. <br /> <br />“N, nothing…” <br /> <br />“? ” <br /> <br />“Um…actually it’s not really nothing but…you know…” <br /> <br />“Yeah, what’s up?” <br /> <br />“Um…ah…that is…” <br /> <br />Awayuki seems strangely flustered for some reason. She looks like she wants to say something but– <br /> <br />“…………” <br /> <br />She continues staring up at me silently.  <br /> <br />After several seconds pass– <br /> <br />*Throb*  <br /> <br />Some strange sound rings out and Awayuki suddenly looks away from me. <br /> <br />“Wha, why’d you suddenly look away like that?” <br /> <br />“I, I don’t know…” <br /> <br />“Huh? If you don’t know then look this way again. I want to see your smile again, Awayuki.” <br /> <br />“……Impossible.” <br /> <br />“Huh? Did I do something bad?” <br /> <br />“It’s not that…it’s not that but…” <br /> <br />“? Then–” <br /> <br />“I told you I don’t know means I don’t know!” <br /> <br />“O-Oh…I see…” <br /> <br />Caught off guard by that sharp retort, I involuntarily recoil. W-Well this is something to welcome too. Since she can properly express her emotions now. Be it joy or anger– <br /> <br />“–!?” <br /> <br />A tremendous chill suddenly runs down my spine. <br /> <br />What’s this…it feels like I’m being regarded with some terrible negative emotion…Anger? No, surpassing that, something more like…killing intent–?! <br /> <br />“…………”  <br /> <br />I carefully look back and…everyone in the audience was about to speak in unison.</p>



<p>“*** Oototmo you explode! ***”</p>



<p>“Why!?”</p>
