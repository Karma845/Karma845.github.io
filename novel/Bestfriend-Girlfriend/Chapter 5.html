<p>Chapter 5: Broken Sword</p>
<p>After returning to Ishka for the first time in about a month and a half, I had two things that I didn’t have before.</p>
<p>One is a black katana. This is not my soul equipment, but a normal weapon made by a human blacksmith.</p>
<p>Even if I say normal, it was made by an Adasteran Empire blacksmith who used black steel, known for its hardness.</p>
<p>It’s an excellent material that costs 10 gold coins each. Specifically, it cost me 50.</p>
<p>The reason I had been away from Ishka for so long was to go to the empire in search of this katana—that’s how it went.</p>
<p>As for how I obtained so much money, firstly, it was from selling materials from the magical beasts I defeated in Tittis.</p>
<p>The tails of manticores are sold at a very high price, around 18 gold coins.</p>
<p>Additionally, there was the price for the medicinal herbs I collected in the deepest part, which amounted to 2 gold coins.</p>
<p>It’s not much compared to the materials from magical beasts, but it’s surprising that I could get gold coins by selling herbs. After all, the herbs in the deepest part sell well.</p>
<p>Finally, there were the gears of the adventurers who were killed in the Lord of the Flies’s nest. I sold them in the empire because it would be problematic later if I sold them in the Kingdom of Canaria.</p>
<p>The necklaces with magical effects and shields with magical defenses were sold at a very high price, and I was able to get 60 gold coins.</p>
<p>Combined with the other earnings, I obtained over 80 gold coins.</p>
<p>One can live comfortably for a month with just one gold coin, so having 80 gold coins was quite something. It truly was a mystery to me to have so much money.</p>
<p>Well, more than half of it went due to the black katana, but it was unavoidable. Black katanas are popular because of their distinctive appearance and their durability and resistance to breaking.</p>
<p>The fact that very few blacksmiths make katanas compared to swords was one of the reasons why the price was so high.</p>
<p>I could have bought a regular katana and saved money, but it’s not that I chose a black katana because it looked cool. It was a choice with the purpose of not drawing attention to my soul equipment.</p>
<p>In the future, when I return to Ishka, there will be times when I have to fight in front of people. At that time, if I fight by summoning a black katana out of nowhere, it will definitely stand out.</p>
<p>It’s possible that some adventurers have heard about the Illusory Sword Style and soul equipment, and it’s not entirely certain that they won’t discover my connection to the Mitsurugi family. After all, the name Sora is Eastern.</p>
<p>To avoid such a situation, a black katana is always kept at my waist. That way, it won’t stand out even if I happen to summon my soul equipment.</p>
<p>That’s why the choice of a black katana, and there wasn’t an option to buy a regular katana from the start.</p>
<p>I had 30 gold coins left after acquiring the black katana. And the other thing I obtained was a beast girl who carried my luggage.</p>
<p>Looking back, the girl opened her mouth with a tense expression.</p>
<p>“Do you need anything, master?”</p>
<p>Young, healthy, and capable of withstanding battles. Ideally, she should be around 15 years old.</p>
<p>With such conditions in mind, the slave trader introduced me to this girl, her name is Seal Arous. It seems she was of the lion type. She had a name like that of a strong warrior.</p>
<p>…Upon asking her, it seems she has never touched anything other than farming tools.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it seems she wasn’t of the lion type but rather a breed of wild cats called ocelots.</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>I don’t think the slave trader deceived me, but she met the conditions, and since I have been closely observing her from the empire to Ishka, there were no issues with her words or behavior.</p>
<p>She hasn’t been an enslaved for many days, and in that sense, she will have doubts and concerns, but it’s inevitable. It can be said that it was a good purchase, just like the black katana. Although I had to spend 30 gold coins, but as I said before, it was unavoidable.</p>
<p>Thinking about that, I opened the door to an inn. The Blue Bird. It was the inn where I used to stay as an adventurer.</p>
<p>Upon seeing me, the innkeeper frowned. I threw some silver coins that were equivalent to a month’s accommodation, almost rubbing it in his face.</p>


<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size">YOU ARE READING STOLEN TRANSLATION. READ THE ORIGINAL TRANSLATION AT GADGETIZEDPANDA.COM</p>


<p>By the way, when the innkeeper’s daughter passed by, I also gave her some gold coins as a tip. It was too much to be considered a tip, but I decided to give it as compensation for previous troubles. I will continue to give the same amount for any eventualities.</p>
<p>When I entered the room, I remembered the confused and surprised faces of those two and burst into laughter.</p>
<p>Well, I’ll leave this little revenge at that. I didn’t choose this inn to show off all the money I have to that father and daughter. This is a supplier for the guild.</p>
<p>Of course, there are many adventurers among the guests. Moreover, it is deeply connected to the guild.</p>
<p>When I was expelled, the information reached the inn within an hour. By staying at this inn, surely my information will be transmitted to the guild.</p>
<p>The accusations directed at Miroslav should have been cleared, but the fact that I mocked the guild master didn’t disappear.</p>
<p>The case with “Falcon Sword” still remains. The guild will definitely continue to mark me as a dangerous person.</p>
<p>That’s why I chose this inn, so that it would be easier for them to mark me. They can watch me as much as they want. I won’t do anything.</p>
<p>If something happens while I’m doing nothing, that means it was the work of someone else. In a sense, the guild will prove my innocence.</p>
<p>However, if a problem occurs on the day I return to Ishka, it would be too convenient. Leaving that aside, I suppose I should also start working.</p>
<p>Yes, I will resume herb gathering from today!</p>
<p>…No, there shouldn’t be any problems with monster subjugation or bandit suppression in my current state.</p>
<p>However, since I was expelled from the guild, I couldn’t accept them as requests, and above all, I didn’t feel like showcasing my strength.</p>
<p>I am still level “1”—I want everyone to continue thinking that for now.</p>
<p>Some may be wondering how I survived and returned from the Lord of the Flies’s nest, but for most, I am still a “Parasite.”</p>
<p>It was a bit later when that perception changed.</p>
<p>Slaves.</p>
<p>The lowest class that exists in the Kingdom of Canaria, the Adasteran Empire, and in most other countries. The system of slavery has only been abolished in the sacred southern kingdom.</p>
<p>Even in the sacred kingdom, it is said to be difficult to completely abolish slavery deeply rooted in the history and society of the continent.</p>
<p>However, the reality of slaves is diverse even if they are called slaves.</p>
<p>Something amusing like this.</p>
<p>A wealthy boy hired a slave as a tomb guard. One day, the wealthy boy wanted to drink something, so he ordered the slave to buy a drink. Then, the slave responded like this: “My job is to be a tomb guard. It’s not to buy drinks.” The wealthy boy went to buy his drink himself with bitterness—something like that.</p>
<p>This shows that slaves have certain rights, and even the master cannot infringe upon them.</p>
<p>To be more specific.</p>
<p>A girl knocks on the door of a slave shop in order to pay off her family’s debt. At that moment, the girl can choose how far she is willing to go to sell herself. To be clear, she can choose whether to sell her chastity or not.</p>
<p>If she doesn’t sell it, she can refuse the sexual service of her master. However, it is natural that the amount of money will decrease accordingly.</p>
<p>Even the slave trader, the possibility of sale differs between those who allow nighttime service and those who don’t, so unless one has a very outstanding skill, a deal may or may not be made.</p>
<p>There’s nothing more wasteful than having a slave that can’t be sold.</p>
<p>As for the beast girl I bought as a slave, she sold everything to the slave trader. Even if I ask for nighttime service, she cannot refuse.</p>
<p>Of course, this was also reflected in the purchase price. Additionally, her visual acuity is very good, as well as her sense of smell. She can climb trees like a monkey, and she can swim like a fish in the water. She has a serious and honest personality.</p>
<p>She is obedient to orders, and although she doesn’t have much volume in her body, she is full of refreshing charm. It’s undoubtedly a very good deal.</p>
<p>Upon asking, it seems her father, who had been supporting the family, lost his legs in an accident, and they began to have problems with their income.</p>
<p>Seal, who was the eldest daughter, seems to have been trying to save her family by selling herself to a slave trader. When I heard that, I piled gold coins in front of the slave trader to break the deal.</p>
<p>It’s not that I’m playing the role of a hero. First of all, I bought a slave this time not to “devour” but to trap a certain elf, so I didn’t care which slave was bought as long as the conditions were met.</p>
<p>The reason I forcefully bought Seal was because she was the most suitable for this occasion.</p>
<p>Now that she has become my slave, Seal was letting out a sensual voice of “Ah… no… hyuu” while sitting on my knees.</p>
<p>We’re not doing anything indecent. I’m just playing with the cat ears on her head.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I did something similar with a cat that settled in the dojo. I nostalgically remembered that. Well, at that time, it scratched me without hesitation, and I cried.</p>
<p>In that sense, I can do whatever I want to this girl slave who sold everything. Fufufu.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“E-Excuse me… M-Master…?”</p>
<p>“Hm? What is it?”</p>
<p>“Well… How long will this… last?”</p>
<p>“For now, until sunrise. We’ll do it every day from now on.”</p>
<p>“……………..Did I… do something that made you uncomfortable? In that case… Hm! I-I apologize…”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not about that. Rather, I’m grateful. But—”</p>
<p>“But…?”</p>
<p>“I’m a pervert who gets excited looking at a girl’s distorted face.”</p>
<p>“Eh?”</p>
<p>“And if it’s something I did with my own hands, even better. Surrender to the thought that you were bought by a terrible master.”</p>
<p>Saying that, I gently caressed around Seal’s waist. Upon receiving a different type of stimulation, her face and body trembled in reaction, and a sweet voice resonated in the room. Realizing that, Seal’s face turned red.</p>
<p>I stroked Seal’s soft brown hair with my left hand and once again caressed her ears with my right hand.</p>
<p>That night, as expected, Seal’s sweet voice continued to shake the air in the room until dawn.</p>
<p>Then, we went to the Tittis forest and collected medicinal herbs shortly after waking up.</p>
<p>After finishing that and when we returned to the inn, I once again placed Seal on my knees and caressed her ears, and sometimes her tail.</p>
<p>The next day was the same, and the next day, and the next. I continued with that. Anyone would have trouble sleeping with that lifestyle.</p>
<p>With insufficient sleep, physical condition will deteriorate. Seal had earbags and looked lethargic.</p>
<p>In that way, I would take Seal to the forest. The adventurers from the same inn, the father and daughter, told me, “Let her rest for a bit,” but I snorted and ignored them.</p>
<p>Then, when we left Ishka and headed to the forest, four people stood in front of us.</p>
<p>They were the members of “Falcon Sword.”</p>
<p>“It seems you’re still working hard to gather herbs. Why don’t you become a pharmacist? That will surely benefit the world and people.”</p>
<p>A pointed hat with a magic staff. And a mage’s robe. It’s the attire that Miroslav always wears, just like his mocking words.</p>
<p>The only difference is that his long red hair is cut. Now it seems that his short hair is braided and hidden under his hat.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the advice. If that’s all you have to say, then I’d like you to move. Unlike you, who can wag your tail at the guild and get fed, I’m very busy.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to talk to you. But—”</p>
<p>Miroslav glanced at Seal behind me. Seeing her looking lethargic like that, he made a crude grimace.</p>
<p>“To make a younger girl than yourself carry all the luggage… I see, you’ve shown who you really are.”</p>
<p>“What I do with my slave is my own business. Besides, a “Murderer” has no right to tell me anything.”</p>
<p>“It seems you’re really foolish. And if you speak in that way, you’ll earn the wrath of the guildmaster.”</p>
<p>“What nonsense. I wouldn’t be saying any of this if you hadn’t come to bother me.”</p>
<p>“It’s rumored that you’re doing terrible things to that girl every night. After mysteriously acquiring money, the first thing you buy is a slave. Your actions are going from bad to worse. If you want to engage with a woman, then first acquire some charm to have an equal romance!”</p>
<p>When Miroslav said all that, this time Lars spoke up. His face was filled with a strong sense of justice.</p>
<p>As I mentioned before, Lars is a boy from a rural village. Selling a wife or daughter to pay taxes wasn’t an uncommon story.</p>
<p>When I was still a member of “Falcon Sword,” the atmosphere would become heavy around Lars when this topic was brought up.</p>
<p>Iria was also the same as Lars. I thought something had happened back then, but I couldn’t ask.</p>
<p>According to the story I heard from Miroslav in the cave, it seems that a girl in Lars’ neighborhood, whom he treated like a younger sister, was sold by her parents.</p>
<p>For Lars, it’s a bitter memory that is hard to forget. That sold girl was three years younger than Lars, and if nothing had happened, she would have been fifteen.</p>
<p>“Sora, that girl fell into slavery because of her family, right? Take care of her. If you can’t do that, then free her!”</p>
<p>“I already said that what I do with my slave is my own business. Are you asking me to free her? You don’t give me orders.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, I have an idea.”</p>
<p>Saying that, Lars reached out for the sword at his waist. Seeing that, I snorted.</p>


<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size">YOU ARE READING STOLEN TRANSLATION. READ THE ORIGINAL TRANSLATION AT GADGETIZEDPANDA.COM</p>


<p>“Hey, hey, do you think you can steal my slave? Or maybe murder? Now I see why I was ambushed in a place like this. There’s also the previous unsolved case, ‘Falcon Sword’ has really fallen low.”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk nonsense, I won’t steal anything! I’m trying to beat you up from the root!”</p>
<p>“You said you’d beat me up? You say very amusing things, Lars. In other words, a high-level adventurer will force a simple civilian to listen? You’ll earn the wrath of the guildmaster.”</p>
<p>“…Will you still not listen?”</p>
<p>“It’s not about that. You’ve been pushing me around for your own convenience. Even if I were to free her, what would be the benefit? It cost me 30 gold coins.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I’ll pay you the 30 gold coins. Will that be fine?”</p>
<p>“Of course not. What kind of idiot would sell something for the same price they bought it?.”</p>
<p>“Then, how about 60 or 100? Just tell me the price. I’ll pay whatever you want!”</p>
<p>Lars said it in an angry tone. 100 gold coins, huh? That would be difficult even for a sixth-class adventurer. I curled up the corners of my lips.</p>
<p>“Alright, let’s see. I’ll sell her to you for one million gold coins.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>
<p>“I said one million. Ahh, if you want, you can pay me in monthly installments of 100,000.”</p>
<p>“Don’t talk nonsense! There’s no way I can pay that amount!”</p>
<p>“You yourself said you would pay whatever I wanted.”</p>
<p>“There’s a limit!”</p>
<p>“Hey, I’m selling you something that I had no intention of selling. This is the most natural thing to do. Should I calculate how much your budget is and set a price accordingly?”</p>
<p>After saying that, I laughed as if mocking him.</p>
<p>“You were trying to give me a specific number, like 100 or 200 gold coins, right? You wanted to put that on the table and then pay. You’re a sixth-class adventurer with high expectations. Besides, the Sauzar company might be willing to pay if it becomes a request from their future son-in-law. What a cheap trick. And the source of the plan… well, I don’t need to say it.”</p>
<p>Glancing at Miroslav, Lars bit his lips in frustration.</p>
<p>“Guh…”</p>
<p>“Rescuing the mistreated slave with goodwill and ingenuity. It’s really something typical of you. But, it’s a shame, Lars. If you understand that already, then leave me alone. If you continue with that attitude, you’ll only cause trouble. Don’t be deceived by the words of that mage.”</p>
<p>“…I challenge you.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I challenge you to a duel, Sora!”</p>
<p>Lars took off the glove from his left hand and threw it at me. The worn leather glove hit my chest with force and fell to the ground.</p>
<p>“Fight me for that girl’s freedom! If I win, you’ll set her free!”</p>
<p>“I refuse.”</p>
<p>“Are you planning to run away?”</p>
<p>“It’s not that, I’m level ‘1,’ you know? Why should I accept a duel that I can’t win? Even if I were to win, there would be no benefits.”</p>
<p>“In that case—”</p>
<p>“In that case, if you win, I’ll become your slave.”</p>
<p>Before Lars could finish speaking, Miroslav stepped forward. The red-haired mage glared at me with resentment.</p>
<p>“If there’s a benefit, then you’ll accept the duel, right? I’ll be your slave, and you can do whatever you want. Oh, of course, all my personal belongings will go to my master. There are valuable magic stones and magical books… I haven’t calculated it precisely, but I guarantee they’re worth more than 30 gold coins.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Miro!”</p>
<p>“It’s fine, Lars. There’s no way you’ll lose. What I promised will never come true. Even if something were to happen… that would be the result of believing in you. I’ll be very proud and won’t hold any grudges.”</p>
<p>“Miro… I didn’t think you believed in me so much…”</p>
<p>Lars stared at Miroslav intently, and she did the same, blushing. They created a space for themselves, disregarding the surroundings as always—well, in this case, it’s a bit different.</p>
<p>“Sorry to interrupt the moment, but I have no intention of accepting that condition. Doing such things with the ‘Murderer’? You must be joking.”</p>
<p>“Sora, you…!”</p>
<p>“Well, if you give me that elf in exchange, maybe I’ll consider it.”</p>
<p>I looked at Luna Maria, who hadn’t said a word until now. I should also include Iria, in the sense that she hadn’t said anything either, but Miroslav probably already said the words she wanted to say.</p>
<p>Saying that so unexpectedly, Luna Maria blinked several times in surprise.</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“An elven slave isn’t something I would acquire even with 100 gold coins. However, to become a slave, it’s essential to have your consent. If you can’t believe in your leader as much as that ‘Murderer,’ then you can refuse.”</p>
<p>Saying that, I looked at Lars. And then, pointing at the glove that fell to the ground with my chin, I continued speaking.</p>
<p>“If you accept this condition, I wouldn’t mind picking up this glove, Lars.”</p>
<p>“….Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes. But words are just words. We can go to the guild and have a meeting with the guildmaster as a witness. If you win, I’ll free Seal. If I win, Luna Maria will become my slave. Needless to say, it’s your duty to make sure Luna Maria remembers this condition. If you can’t do that, then there will be no duel. What do you think?”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“….Alright. I’ll persuade Luna, and we’ll proceed with the procedure at the guild as soon as possible. In return, Sora, until that day comes–“</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I won’t lay a finger on Seal. If you think I’m lying, you can ask the innkeeper’s daughter who always listens outside the room.”</p>
<p>Finishing my words, I picked up the glove that was on the ground. At this moment, the duel between Lars and me was decided.</p>
<p>Putting aside the opinions of Seal and Luna Maria.</p>
<p>“You’re amazing, Lars. You really put that obscene man in his place!”</p>
<p>Facing Luna Maria, Miroslav cheerfully praised Lars. In response, Lars blushed slightly.</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Miro. In the middle of the conversation, your words completely slipped my mind… Rather than putting him in his place, I was just angry at him.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, he probably thought that way because you’re that type of person. Now that girl named Seal will be freed from Sora’s grasp.”</p>
<p>Saying that, Miroslav firmly held Lars’ hand with both hands and gave a big smile. Lars chuckled a bit, feeling embarrassed.</p>
<p>Watching the two of them, Luna Maria felt somewhat bewildered. Miroslav, noticing that gaze, spoke while averting her eyes slightly.</p>
<p>“But, to think that I would choose Luna as a slave instead of me. That was my miscalculation. I’m sorry, Luna.”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“But don’t worry!”</p>
<p>Miroslav raised her voice to interrupt what Luna Maria wanted to say.</p>
<p>“There’s no way Lars can lose against that pervert. Lars is level ’16,’ and he’s level ‘1.’ Lars’ victory is already assured. You may have concerns about becoming a slave, but please believe in Lars. I also ask you to do so.”</p>
<p>Saying that, Miroslav lowered her head deeply. Then, Lars nodded firmly to ease Luna Maria’s anxiety.</p>
<p>“It’s just as Miro said. I’ll never lose to an abuser and pervert. I understand that you may not be willing to accept this kind of bet, but I want you to understand. It’s also to save that girl named Seal… Please!”</p>
<p>Lars said, “Please,” but he didn’t seem to think that Luna Maria would refuse.</p>
<p>He was very confident in his victory, and he seemed to think that his companion was too. Lars believed that she wouldn’t refuse.</p>
<p>But Luna Maria didn’t nod. She couldn’t. Because she felt Sora’s hidden power more than anyone else.</p>
<p>Earlier, when she saw Sora after a long time, she noticed that what she had seen in him before had become even greater.</p>
<p>She had expected it, so she shouldn’t be as rigid as before, but still, when she saw Sora, she felt a pressing sensation in her heart as if it were being bitten.</p>
<p>When asked if Lars could win against that Sora, Luna Maria just shook her head.</p>
<p>Lars, noticing that expression on Luna Maria’s face, tried to say something to her immediately.</p>
<p>But Iria, who had been silent until then, interrupted him before he could.</p>
<p>“Lars, that’s enough. I see that you don’t understand. You can’t bet others for  your duels. It’s natural for Luna to be skeptical.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I suppose that’s true. I’m sorry, I guess I got carried away.”</p>
<p>“Besides, isn’t something strange?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“You’re level ’16,’ and Sora is level ‘1,’ obviously you would win. But he should know that more than we do. Why would he accept such a disadvantageous duel?”</p>
<p>“Well… probably because he thinks he can win, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s why I wonder why he thinks that way. He accepted the duel because he believes he can win. Moreover, we don’t know the reason. Sora hasn’t appeared in Ishka for nearly two months since what happened with the Lord of Flies. It seems he was in the empire, and he may have gained some strange power there. We shouldn’t let our guard down.”</p>
<p>Listening to Iria’s words, Lars furrowed his brow and started thinking.</p>
<p>At that moment, Luna Maria thought that this was a good opportunity to express her thoughts to her companions.</p>
<p>“Lars, this is something related to what Iria said…”</p>
<p>“What is it, Luna?”</p>
<p>“This is a feeling as a spiritual bearer, and it’s hard to obtain clear evidence… but the current Sora-san is different from before.”</p>
<p>“Different from before?”</p>
<p>“Yes. It’s likely that the current Sora-san is not level ‘1.’ I sense a power that can’t be compared to before. I think something may have happened in the Lord of Flies’ nest.”</p>
<p>If she used the word “dragon,” her credibility would decrease. That’s why Luna Maria explained Sora’s anomaly in easy-to-understand terms.</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Iria muttered as if she had remembered something.</p>
<p>“…At that time, among the missing were C-rank groups.”</p>
<p>“Yes. There should have been many people with magical equipment. That man who escaped from the Lord of Flies’ nest must have sold those items. Otherwise, there’s no way that man who was kicked out of the inn and couldn’t even tip suddenly has gold coins.”</p>
<p>“I see. There was a mysterious sword at his waist that I didn’t see before. So, that’s it.”</p>
<p>“Yes, that must be something he obtained by selling the remains of the dead. There’s no doubt about it. The reason he went to the empire was to sell the things he couldn’t sell in Ishka. And with that money, he bought a weapon and a slave that don’t suit him at all. That’s why he now has that arrogant attitude towards others. He took the trouble to stay at the inn that kicked him out before, just with that, you can see the unpleasant malice he possesses.”</p>
<p>“In that case, the chances of victory that Iria mentioned…”</p>
<p>“It must be that katana. Hehe, he’s a child who had only touched a toy knife, but now that he has the sword of an adult, he surely feels powerful just by swinging it. I truly feel sorry for him.”</p>
<p>Miroslav, who cut off all the concerns of Iria and Luna Maria, looked at Lars again. Then, she reached out her hand to his cheek.</p>
<p>It was unknown if it was Luna Maria’s imagination, but in both of Miroslav’s eyes, it seemed that an indescribable light flickered for a moment.</p>
<p>“Lars. It’s the duty of adults to educate mischievous children. It’s the duty of an expert to teach a newcomer who misunderstands his sudden level increase a lesson. You must show Sora the true power of an adventurer and a warrior. It’s also to save that poor beast girl. That is your duty…”</p>

<p>In the city of Ishka, dueling methods were not uncommon. Many adventurers wanted to resolve their problems with swords or fists. That was common.</p>
<p>However, they weren’t allowed to do it in public. For a duel to be officially recognized, the presence of witnesses was necessary.</p>
<p>A place for the duel was chosen, preparations were made, and the results were guaranteed. Rejecting the outcome of a duel was the same as insulting the witnesses.</p>
<p>Because of that, witnesses with high status and proper responsibility were required.</p>
<p>In other words, if there weren’t enough witnesses, the duel would be considered a private battle and would be eliminated according to the city’s safety law.</p>
<p>As I suggested, the guild master, Elgart, would be the witness of the duel between Lars and me.</p>
<p>The place was a training field in the guild. There were no spectators or crowds, and considering myself, Lars, and Elgart in that space, there were only “Falcon’s Sword,” Seal, and the receptionist named Liddell.</p>
<p>To be honest, I was expecting a situation where adventurers and staff would be here to cheer and boo, but my expectations were shattered.</p>
<p>Well, it’s a duel between those who were originally involved. Perhaps it was decided to avoid trouble in the middle of the duel, so they didn’t inform other adventurers.</p>
<p>But there’s the fear that the results may be undermined if Lars loses. It wouldn’t be surprising if the guild master who absolved Miroslav’s sins now does the same with Lars’ defeat.</p>
<p>While thinking about that, the door of the training field opened, and a middle-aged man entered.</p>
<p>“…Haa… Haa… goodness, I apologize for the delay. There was a problem when I left, and it took me time to resolve it.”</p>
<p>That robust figure in a silk suit reminiscent of a merchant. That person greeted the people gathered in this place with gleaming eyes.</p>
<p>“My name is Fiodor from the Slave Trade Association. Mr. Elgart and I will serve as witnesses for today’s duel. It’s a pleasure.”</p>
<p>After the greeting, Fiodor happily looked at Elgart.</p>
<p>“I already found it strange that Mr. Elgart contacted me, but it seems things have gotten very interesting.”</p>
<p>“The details are as I wrote. It’s almost time. If it’s alright with Mr. Fiodor, I would like to start right away. Are you in agreement?”</p>
<p>“Yes, of course, more than in agreement. Will a new slave be born or will a slave be freed? Whatever the outcome, there will be a slave involved.”</p>
<p>Although Fiodor said remarkable words, the Slave Trade Association is a large organization that stretches across the continent. It has deep ties with other nations, and its influence surpasses more than a hundred countries.</p>
<p>If it’s someone sent from that organization, Fiodor is not incompetent or irresponsible. He would be sufficient as a witness.</p>
<p>But if I don’t accept Fiodor as a witness, I’ll end up in conflict with the Slave Trade Association. That would be very problematic.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>With the witnesses gathered, I looked at Lars in front of me again. He was carrying a one-handed sword, a round shield, and steel armor.</p>
<p>Probably all with top-class magical items. I suppose this is the strength of those who have a large trading company behind them.</p>
<p>On the other hand, except for my black katana, I only have the leather armor that I always wear. But it’s a partial armor that only protects my chest. My defensive power was low. If it was judged from the armor’s perspective, it would be my defeat.</p>
<p>Rather, I was at a level where Lars would laugh if he weren’t mature. Of course, no one was laughing here.</p>
<p>It’s natural to give your all in a duel that can involve your life. Lars, with a serious expression, stared at me intently.</p>
<p>“Then… both of you, get ready!”</p>
<p>Lars raised his shield and sword in response to Elgart’s voice.</p>
<p>I held my katana. I won’t use my soul equipment or energy in this duel. This is as a precaution so that neither the guild nor anyone else can covet my power, and as I mentioned before, I won’t use my soul equipment or energy because it’s also to assess my own strength.</p>
<p>“Haa!”</p>
<p>Lars started with a strong attack, taking a brutal step forward. If I stood still and silent, he would surely deeply cut into my left shoulder.</p>
<p>Of course, I wasn’t willing to receive the first attack. I jumped back lightly to make the opponent cut through the air, then I would launch a counterattack when his posture collapsed.</p>
<p>The timing was perfect, but as expected from a sixth-class adventurer, Lars moved his shield to avoid my counterattack. Taking precautions to minimize the gaps that occur after an attack was not something the old Lars had.</p>
<p>Thinking about that, Lars’ second attack came quickly. It was faster than the first. It was a movement that didn’t seem like he was wearing heavy metal armor, and apparently, the first attack served as the foundation for the next one.</p>
<p>I realized I couldn’t dodge it, so this time, I used the surface of the katana to intercept Lars’ attack.</p>
<p>A numbing pressure was transmitted through the blade. It was a heavy strike. He put strength in his legs and waist. It was natural, Lars is a completely different person from five years ago.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Sora!? You won’t be able to defeat me just by evading!”</p>
<p>Third strike, fourth strike, fifth strike… Lars shouted provocatively as he continued his attacks.</p>
<p>I curled my lips and responded accordingly.</p>
<p>“Thanks for the advice.”</p>
<p>Lars attacked with a thrust, but I dodged it by moving to the side. Then, I evaded the shield attack that came immediately after. He also tried to trip me with a kick, but I evaded that too.</p>
<p>As I did, I persistently watched Lars. I carefully observed the four basic concepts considered important in the Illusory Sword style, namely energy perception. I’m observing closely.</p>
<p>A general from the empire once said, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles,” but it doesn’t just apply to soldiers. Even if I don’t use my soul equipment or flow energy, technically Lars is superior.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Lars has overwhelming experience acquired as an adventurer. That’s why I was trying to find the key to neutralize that difference in his movements.</p>
<p>From one perspective, it’s dangerous to watch each of Lars’ movements with eyes like a snake.</p>
<p>I don’t know if it’s because he despises my gaze or if he’s annoyed that none of his attacks are connecting, but Lars’ attacks have become a bit more ostentatious. They weren’t careless attacks, but the precision is lower than before.</p>
<p>It hasn’t been that long since we started, so it would be too soon for him to be irritated.</p>
<p>If there were spectators here, some would have that impression.</p>
<p>But, this was predictable. In Lars’ case, he’s fighting against a level “1” opponent. He’s surely thinking that this shouldn’t be happening. A sixth-class adventurer who can’t land a hit on a former tenth-class expelled adventurer would certainly be frustrated.</p>
<p>His comrades and the guild master must also be worried about that aspect.</p>
<p>Moreover, I’m sure Miroslav said something that stuck in his head. Something like “You must show him the true power of an adventurer and a warrior.” And if that turned into actions, it was inevitable for him to become impatient.</p>

<p>—Indeed, I guess it’s also a kind of tactic. Lars has been vulnerable to his temper since before. It seems he’s naive like a simple peasant.</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Lars? You can’t defeat me just by flailing your sword.”</p>
<p>Returning his earlier words, Lars shouted in frustration.</p>
<p>“Shut up! Stop evading and fight directly!”</p>
<p>“Unfortunately, a katana is not a weapon for straightforward cutting. This is my way of fighting. Nevertheless, the problem is that even though you’re a sixth-class adventurer, you can’t catch me.”</p>
<p>“Kuh!”</p>
<p>“Your movements are becoming more and more sluggish!”</p>
<p>When Lars slightly lowered his shield, I seized that opening to strike him in the chest. I wounded him through the gaps in his armor.</p>
<p>“Guah!?”</p>
<p>“Look, your shield has lowered again.”</p>
<p>I continued to cut through the gaps in his armor. Lars distorted his face in pain, but he swung his shield to the side and swung his sword.</p>
<p>However, the attack was showy. It wasn’t an attack using his legs or waist like before. There was no need to dodge.</p>
<p>After that, we continued cutting for a while. Then, after the number of strikes reached fifty, I kept my distance from Lars.</p>
<p>Lars was out of breath and his face was distorted. The blood flowing from the gaps in his armor soaked the training field floor.</p>
<p>…Yes. What can I say, he’s very weak. I can say that Ayaka and Raguna from five years ago are much stronger.</p>
<p>I also understood the reason. Lars’ sword is fundamentally a weapon for fighting against monsters, not humans.</p>
<p>Of course, it’s possible that Lars has fought against other people. There is no shortage of human enemies for adventurers, such as bandits, necromancers, and evil priests.</p>
<p>However, if you look at them all together, there will overwhelmingly be more monsters. Firstly, cutting people won’t teach you swordsmanship skills.</p>
<p>But, in that aspect, even though it’s a blank for me, I have studied the Illusory Sword style since childhood and have a lot of experience in interpersonal fights.</p>
<p>Technique and attitude are also part of that. Furthermore, I have fought against the golden generation of the Mitsurugi family, which is rare even from a historical perspective. The experience of fighting strong individuals is extensive.</p>
<p>That is connected to the reality before my eyes. Taking that into account, there’s no need to prolong the fight. I took a step forward.</p>
<p>“Lars!”</p>
<p>It seems he sensed something in my movements, unexpectedly, Iria called out to Lars.</p>
<p>When Lars reacted to that and readied himself again, my katana extended in the air like a snake and entwined with Lars’ sword. In the next moment.</p>
<p>-CLANG.</p>
<p>Resonating with a metallic sound, Lars’ sword flew through the air. Then, the sword impaled itself in a spot a little distance away from us.</p>
<p>As I pointed my katana at the stunned Lars’ neck, the calm voice of the guild master resonated.</p>
<p>“That’s enough! The winner is Sora!”</p>
<p>At that moment, as I looked into Lars’ eyes, I pondered. Perhaps, that’s the look I had when I was defeated by Esparto in the trial ceremony.</p>
<p>“W-Wait! Please wait! One more time! Let me fight one more time, please!”</p>
<p>Those were Lars’ words when he came to his senses. He didn’t thank Iria, who was using healing magic on him, he just stared intensely at me.</p>
<p>I shrugged slightly in response to that Lars.</p>
<p>“Are you trying to invalidate the result recognized by the witnesses? They’re the guild master of adventurers and the slave trading association, you know?”</p>
<p>“N-No, you’re wrong! This was my defeat. I accept it. So, let’s fight again, Sora! It’s true! We never said it was just one duel! This time, I’ll win!”</p>
<p>“Hmph. Well, I’m fine with that. But who will you bet on this time?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I won the previous duel. In other words, Luna Maria is already mine. If you want to fight again, you’ll have to prepare another slave. And just so you know, I don’t want Miroslav. That means you can only bet on Iria.”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, Lars unintentionally looked at Iria. She, who was healing Lars’ wounds, shook her head with a stern expression.</p>
<p>“Iria!”</p>
<p>“No, Lars. Your wounds have closed, but the lost blood hasn’t returned. You won’t stand a chance if you fight in this state.”</p>
<p>“N-No worries, now I know Sora’s fighting style. This time, I’ll win!”</p>
<p>Iria’s palm struck Lars’ cheek abruptly. A loud sound echoed in the surroundings.</p>
<p>Iria scolded Lars, who was completely taken aback by what had just happened.</p>
<p>“That’s enough! How long do you plan to run away from the result? You lost! If you don’t accept that fact first, there won’t be a rematch or anything!”</p>
<p>“…..Iri…..a…..”</p>
<p>Seemingly, that scolding brought him back to reality, and Lars knelt down immediately. I secretly laughed as I watched them.</p>
<p>Iria’s attitude is strict but gentle. This is probably the most correct response.</p>
<p>However, for humans who have been struck at the depths of their hearts, that response can sometimes be uncomfortable.</p>
<p>At that moment, upon hearing sweet words—if there is someone who only says sweet words, any man would be there. Even childhood friends, it’s not an eternal relationship.</p>
<p>I didn’t see Miroslav. There was no need to see her. Everything went according to plan.</p>
<p>I obtained a dream elf slave!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>—That was not my original intention.</p>
<p>However, on the night I defeated Lars, when I had Luna Maria in front of me, whom I put a slave collar on after returning to the inn, it was a fact that a desire apart from devouring souls was very intense. After all, she was someone I once had feelings for. I couldn’t even put it into words, but I can’t stay calm in front of her.</p>
<p>Naturally, Luna Maria has given me all her rights, so she can’t deny my requests. This is a slave contract that was officially exchanged in the presence of slave trader Fiodor.</p>
<p>Of course, I don’t need to restrain myself. I would like to do many things at this moment, but there was something I had to verify before that.</p>
<p>“So, what are you planning?”</p>
<p>I asked Luna Maria, who had her gaze lowered while blushing. By the way, she has a red face because she’s embarrassed.</p>
<p>Now, Luna Maria was wearing a silk outfit that perfectly fit her body. There was no fabric on her limbs, and the back and chest were quite daringly exposed. It was more like lingerie than a outfit, and it seemed like she could swim with it.</p>
<p>If I have to say it directly, it’s very erotic. And she’s wearing it, an elf who is said to be very beautiful and elegant.</p>
<p>Most men would be salivating. Just like I am right now.</p>
<p>However, I didn’t put that outfit on Luna Maria solely for lascivious intentions. With that made clear, it made it impossible to hide weapons.</p>
<p>“…..I don’t have any plans, Sora-san.”</p>
<p>“Don’t play dumb. Even if it was because of the bet… well, that was because Lars lost, but still, you’re too calm. You didn’t even resist when the slave contract was established. By establishing that contract, it’s clear how you would be treated. If you accepted it so easily, it just makes me think that you’re planning something by being close to me.”</p>
<p>Of course, it was me who pushed Luna Maria into such a situation. Even if she had resisted, the outcome wouldn’t have changed.</p>
<p>But that doesn’t mean people who give up easily can continue being adventurers for many years. I could only think that Luna Maria was plotting something.</p>
<p>However, the problem is that I can’t predict what she might be plotting. If you think about it, it’s possible for her to attack me while I sleep—as long as the slave contract has been established through the slave trading association, Luna Maria’s actions of if she kill her master won’t be overlooked.</p>
<p>Retaliation measures by a large continental organization. Surely those who do that will be tortured until the day they die.</p>
<p>Additionally, there are three types of magic in the slave collar Luna Maria has around her neck: “Detector,” “Paralysis,” and “Asphyxiation.”</p>
<p>It would be difficult for Luna Maria to kill me while I have all of that, and even if she succeeds, escaping would be complicated. It’s impossible for her not to know that.</p>
<p>While thinking about that, Luna Maria spoke up calmly.</p>
<p>“I don’t have anything planned. But there’s something I want to ask.”</p>
<p>“Hm? What is it?”</p>
<p>“Who are you?”</p>
<p>“…..What? Is it that I’m some heartless monster or something?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not that! It’s something else!”</p>
<p>Luna Maria shook her head hastily and looked around as if she was unsure about something. But then, she looked directly at me with a determined gleam in her eyes.</p>
<p>“…..I can see a dragon.”</p>
<p>“…………………..What?”</p>
<p>“I can see a dragon in you. A dragon covered in scales darker than the night. The first time I saw it was when you returned alive from the Lord of Flies’s nest.”</p>
<p>“…………………..Hoo”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if you have a dragon inside your body or if a dragon took the form of a person. But I can certainly see a dragon. That’s why I asked, ‘Who are you?'”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t born to be a different person or anything like that. That’s the answer, but…”</p>


<p class="has-black-color has-text-color has-medium-font-size">YOU ARE READING STOLEN TRANSLATION. READ THE ORIGINAL TRANSLATION AT GADGETIZEDPANDA.COM</p>


<p>I paused to think. She’s probably referring to the Soul Eater dragon. Ever since my soul equipment awakened, I can tell she’s not talking nonsense.</p>
<p>“Did you tell anyone about this?”</p>
<p>“No… it’s just something I sense as a spiritual vessel. I can’t prove it to others…”</p>
<p>“Does that mean other spiritual vessels can see it too?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know. I can’t confirm it because the way spirits are captured varies from person to person.”</p>
<p>“I see. I’ll remember that there’s a possibility of being seen in that way. Oh, now that you mention it…”</p>
<p>Suddenly, I remembered when I saw Luna Maria again in the Tittis Forest. Also, when I exposed the sins of the ‘Falcon Sword’ at the guild. Every time, Luna Maria trembled in a terrible state…</p>
<p>“Maybe it was because you noticed that dragon or whatever it is?”</p>
<p>“…Yes. It’s as if the dragon is staring at me. I couldn’t even breathe.”</p>
<p>I see. So, it wasn’t hypocritical when she apologized to me after chasing me down that time?</p>
<p>I was angry, but if it was a hasty decision on my part, I suppose I can’t blame her, I think.</p>
<p>No, wait. More importantly…</p>
<p>“If you could see the dragon, didn’t you think I might win today’s duel? Why did you accept the bet? It was something Lars and I arranged during our conversation. You could have simply refused.”</p>
<p>“That… is true. With all that said, I suppose there’s no need to cover things up anymore.”</p>
<p>“Hm? What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“It’s about Miro… Aren’t you two connected?”</p>
<p>As soon as I heard that, I chuckled.</p>
<p>“Connected? Me with that despicable woman? That’s a tasteless joke. Is that also a sensation as a spiritual vessel?”</p>
<p>“I felt something was wrong after Miro came back when she disappeared. Occasionally, there were strange movements of the spirits. However, it was just a vague feeling, no solid evidence. I convinced myself on the day when Lars and you decided to have the duel.”</p>
<p>“What happened?”</p>
<p>“Miro said it. Although she bet all her personal belongings, as a result, she apologized to me when I assumed that role. It looked like she apologized sincerely… but there was a mischievous imp dancing on her shoulder. That’s when I realized. Miro was enjoying that situation. Clearly, she was guiding Lars. Even if Iria and I expressed concern, Miro laughed it off and tried to lead Lars into the duel.”</p>
<p>Saying that, Luna Maria weakly shook her head.</p>
<p>“First of all, it was Miro who mentioned that beast girl named Seal. Everything that happened today was in the palm of your hand, right?”</p>
<p>“Who knows. But if you suspected to that extent, it should raises further doubts. Why did you follow through with the bet? If you believed Miroslav was connected to me, you may not have trusted Lars, but you could have talked to Iria. You could have even consulted with the guild master.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I thought about it. But if that led to Miro being kicked out of the group, I thought you would use another type of strategy. I decided it was better to keep things as they were rather than anger a dragon.”</p>
<p>“Keep things as they were, huh? Is it a case of, if the dragon’s target was you, then you had to surrender to calm things down? Well, it certainly is a classic tale of delivering a damsel in distress to an evil dragon as a sacrifice.”</p>
<p>“I apologize if I’m thinking too much. But…”</p>
<p>“Hmph. Well, it’s true. Don’t dwell on it too much.”</p>
<p>There’s the fear of saying something more, but so far there are no presences touching my senses. No one is listening or lurking in secret. I suppose there won’t be any problems later with what was discussed here. Even if it becomes a problem, I’ll manage somehow.</p>
<p>“But why would you go to such lengths? The hero rescuing the damsel in distress is just a fairy tale.”</p>
<p>“You’re just apologizing for your own satisfaction. If you want to do that, do it in front of a mirror, hypocrite.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“That day, I abandoned you when you were being chased by the Lord of Flies. Even knowing what would happen if it caught you. I could see Miro’s actions, but still, I wanted to prioritize saving my life and my comrades’. So, there’s nothing I can do or say to persuade you. Like you said, I’m a ‘hypocrite’.”</p>
<p>Then, Luna Maria slowly walked in front of me and knelt down. She lowered her head deeply. That figure was practically that of a slave and master.</p>
<p>“This time, I want to prove it through actions, not words. Allow me to be by your side and serve you, please.”</p>
<p>“Is it a form of atonement for using me as bait?”</p>
<p>When I asked, Luna Maria shook her head. Eyes like two jewels looked at me directly.</p>
<p>“No, it’s up to Sora-san to decided if this is a form of atonement, not me. Even if I decide on the details of the atonement and act accordingly, it won’t absolve my sin, right? I just want to serve you with everything I can do now.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>
<p>If the word “atonement” came out of Luna Maria’s mouth, I would accuse her of being a hypocrite after all. However, it seems this elf in front of me genuinely wants to redeem herself. It was very gratifying to me in many ways.</p>
<p>Of course, I didn’t show it on my face. I stared at Luna Maria intently.</p>
<p>“You’ve been talking about serving me for a while now, but remember that you’re already my slave. Even if you dislike it, I will compel you. Don’t forget that.”</p>
<p>Luna Maria, who accurately understood my true intentions, placed her hands on her chest as if relieved. Then, she lowered her head deeply once again and spoke with a serious voice.</p>
<p>“As you wish, my master.”</p>
