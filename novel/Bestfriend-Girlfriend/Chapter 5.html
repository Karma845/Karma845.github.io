<h3>Chapter 5 - Complex and the female knight</h3>



<p>&#8220;I think I&#8217;d like to go somewhere different today if that&#8217;s okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>It was noon of the next day, a day after yesterday&#8217;s incident, in front of Yui&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>Yui looked relieved that I had come to pick her up as usual, but as soon as I said that, she was immediately worried.</p>



<p>&#8220;This isn&#8217;t our usual internet cafe, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, that&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…..Can&#8217;t we just stay at our usual internet cafe…? It&#8217;s a little scary…to go elsewhere…&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui looked as anxious as a frightened little animal. Seeing her like this, I felt like indulging her, but I held back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Just to reconfirm, Yui still wants to overcome her communicative disorder, and she wants my help with that, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay. And you&#8217;ve gotten pretty used to me over the last few days, am I right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….Yeah. At least I don&#8217;t get nervous and lose my voice anymore, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>It reminded me of the day we first met.</p>



<p>（Really…it was such a mess at that time….）</p>



<p>And now, she could look me in the eye and talk to me. That alone was a very big improvement.</p>



<p>But at the same time, I don&#8217;t think we can make any more progress if we continue as we are.</p>



<p>I was originally a friend of Yui&#8217;s from the start, so I was able to fit in easily.</p>



<p>But as of now, other people are still tough. I can&#8217;t help but get nervous whenever she&#8217;s in front of others.</p>



<p>A particular problem was Yui&#8217;s complex in regards to her white hair.</p>



<p>Even if she doesn&#8217;t completely overcome it…I need her to do a little better in order to move forward. …I want to help her feel a little more confident about herself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hadn&#8217;t I told you that I used to be bad at communicating, too?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? You did?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. Well, what can I say? I was the same as you, and I wanted to make friends with you while we were playing games together.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;… Ehehehehe ♪&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui showed a shy, bashful smile.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m so happy. Yuuma was the same as me.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But were you really bad at communicating? From the very first time I met you, I always thought you were a very communicative person.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, well, that&#8217;s because I was blessed with the people around me, such as my sister and others. My sister is a very communicative person, you see. Don&#8217;t you remember seeing her yesterday?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, if it&#8217;s okay with you, I&#8217;d like you to meet my sister, or at least get to know her…… What do you think?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…………&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui lowered her eyes, looking a little uneasy.</p>



<p>&#8220;….I-Is it really okay? Will Yuuma&#8217;s sister think that…my hair is weird or something…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s absolutely fine. You can stay rest assured about that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui&#8217;s eyes fluttered as Yuuma answered immediately.</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Are you sure it&#8217;s going to be okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. In fact, I&#8217;ve already told her about the situation, and she&#8217;s been very enthusiastic about it, saying that I should bring you over……Oh, but of course, if you don&#8217;t like it, I won&#8217;t force you to do it, so there&#8217;s that……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….I-I think it&#8217;s okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui looked frightened, but she still said so.</p>



<p>&#8220;If Yuuma says it&#8217;s okay…then I&#8217;ll believe in him…&#8221;</p>



<p>I could feel Yui&#8217;s trust in me.</p>



<p>I felt my cheeks heating up, which made me happy but somewhat embarrassed.</p>



<p>&#8220;Alright, let&#8217;s go then.&#8221;</p>



<p>　†</p>



<p>Our destination was a little far from the bustling station area.</p>



<p>It was quite a distance away, so we took the bus.</p>



<p>After about 10 minutes on the bus, we came off and headed to…</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah…I thought you&#8217;d react that way given this was a hair salon after all…&#8221;</p>



<p>A little outside the city&#8217;s centre lay a privately owned beauty salon called World breaker. …As always, the name sounded like the special move of a boss, which made Yuuma chuckle.</p>



<p>The signboard depicted beautiful girls fighting with scissors and combs.</p>



<p>I wonder how many people would be able to recognize this as a hair salon at first glance.</p>



<p>And next to the entrance was a sign that read,</p>



<p>『For those who want to change themselves. Now&#8217;s the time』.</p>



<p>On the other hand, there was a picture of a girl with beautifully braided hair, bleeding and fighting. I wonder what kind of change is this?</p>



<p>Rather, isn&#8217;t this change a little too much in the wrong direction?</p>



<p>Yui looked up at me with a subtle, drawn-out expression.</p>



<p>&#8220;…..H-Here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Er, this is a proper hair salon, okay? You don&#8217;t have to look so anxious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But it says it&#8217;s for private use.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, they did that for us.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Are you sure about that, Yuuma? The money….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay. My sister&#8217;s the one who runs this place. Well, I was surprised when she insisted on reserving the place entirely for us.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Your sister&#8217;s the one managing the store?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. She may be a little pushy and quirky, but she&#8217;s definitely a good person, so you don&#8217;t have to worry about anything.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>I smiled as much as I could so as not to make Yui nervous.</p>



<p>（……Even though I said that, I couldn&#8217;t help but feel a little nervous. My sister has an extreme difference when it comes to being reliable and not being reliable.）</p>



<p>I chuckled a little, remembering all the things I&#8217;ve done in the past. However, I couldn&#8217;t just stand here forever, so I pushed open the glass door at the entrance.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ojamashimasu.&#8221;</p>



<p>Unlike the overly unique exterior of the store, the inside of the store was a stylish cafe-like barbering space.</p>



<p>Yui came in after me, looking around nervously. She was not accustomed to this kind of place. While hiding behind my back, she scanned the area curiously.</p>



<p>&#8220;Onee-chan? Are you here?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, yes, I&#8217;m coming.&#8221;</p>



<p>When I called out to the back of the store, a cheerful voice answered.</p>



<p>However, despite this, I could hear the sound of clanking, along with some scraping metal footsteps.</p>



<p>Then──a woman wearing a full-face helmet and dress armour appeared from the back of the store.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui froze. I placed my face with my hands as if I didn&#8217;t want to face reality.</p>



<p>The kind of dress armour that my sister was wearing was the kind you could only see in manga or anime──it&#8217;s the kind of thing supposed to protect your vitals, but why was her chest area exposed? That dress armour just makes you want to poke your head in.</p>



<p>Her head was covered with a rugged full-face helmet. Her hand was equipped with a giant sword made of papier mâché, which was as tall as she was. This was the look of Nene&#8217;s favourite anime character.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hahahaha! I&#8217;ve been waiting for you! Now it&#8217;s time to put an end to our war that&#8217;s been going on since the last time I saw you!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…..Eh!? What!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui started panicking when she was suddenly asked to take a specific pose.</p>



<p>Well, that&#8217;s understandable.</p>



<p>&#8220;….What are you even doing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What? Well, I heard that she&#8217;s the type of person who gets nervous in front of other people, so I thought I&#8217;d ease her nerves. Also, first impressions are important, aren&#8217;t they?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And what makes you think this is a good first impression?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuu-kun&#8217;s….eyes…are cold….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just take off the helmet for now. It&#8217;s well made, but it&#8217;s too ugly looking. Yui&#8217;s scared of it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay.&#8221;</p>



<p>She replied and took off her helmet. Out from inside came a woman with beautifully braided blonde hair and an innocent smile resembling that of a naughty child. It was Nene, my older sister.</p>



<p>Yui was hiding behind my back, looking at her cautiously. Sure enough, she looked pretty frightened. But I didn&#8217;t think she&#8217;d make that much of an impact.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Yui, are you okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m fine.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui fearfully emerged from my back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hello, Yui-chan. My little brother&#8217;s been taking care of me. I&#8217;m Sugisaki Nene. Nice to meet you♪.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nene said so and held out her hand.</p>



<p>Yui looked up in a panic and waited for Yuuma&#8217;s confirmation. Yuuma nodded, and she shook her hand,</p>



<p>&#8220;….N-Nice to meet you…I&#8217;m Kamishiro Yui….&#8221;</p>



<p>Nene gazed at Yui as she shook her hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Ah, um……?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re so cute~~!!♡&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mugu!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Nene tugged on Yui&#8217;s hand and brought it towards her flabby chest.<br>Yui was drowning in her breasts as she was jiggled around.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuu-kun, how is this girl so cute!? She&#8217;s got this frightened, little-animal look that&#8217;s right up my alley! Hey, hey, can I take her home with me!? Can I!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course not! What are you talking about!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No? ……I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know how I should react if you look that stumped…&#8221;</p>



<p>When Nene released Yui from her chest, she ran back to my back, whimpering.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yuuma…&#8221;</p>



<p>She pulled out her phone and looked over at me.</p>



<p>It seems that she was so flustered that she lost her voice. Seeing that she wanted to chat with me, I took out my phone as well.</p>



<p>I had already explained the situation to Nene beforehand, so she watched over Yui and me without saying anything.</p>



<p>『Yuuma is this person okay!? She&#8217;s not going to eat me, is she!?』</p>



<p>『No, I think it&#8217;s fine.……maybe.』</p>



<p>『Maybe!? Why don&#8217;t you sound confident about that!? Or rather, she&#8217;s an obscene older sister!? Isn&#8217;t she the kind of naughty older sister you only see in mangas!?』</p>



<p>『It definitely looks something like that, but could you please be more subtle about it!』</p>



<p>As we were talking about this, Yui suddenly noticed something.</p>



<p>『Yuuma, do you like your sister after all?』</p>



<p>『What are you talking about!?』</p>



<p>『Isn&#8217;t that a standard thing to do when your parents get remarried and bring home a naughty, older sister?』</p>



<p>『S-Standard!?』</p>



<p>（Well, actually, there was a time when I longed for her! There was a time when I was in agony over all the teasing! It&#8217;s no use. Junior high school boys just can&#8217;t compete with breasts like that!)）</p>



<p>──And that was when…</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm, so this is what you&#8217;re like when you chat, Yui-chan. You&#8217;re a really funny and interesting girl.&#8221;</p>



<p>Before I knew it, Nene was looking at my phone.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey!? Isn&#8217;t it a breach of etiquette to look at other people&#8217;s phones without permission!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh well. By the way, do you actually like me, Yuu-kun? Well, if you&#8217;re actually into it, I might consider it, you know～?&#8221;</p>



<p>She happily said and crossed her arms, showing off her ample breasts in a generous manner.</p>



<p>Her ample chest peeked out from her clothes, and I couldn&#8217;t help but glance at them.</p>



<p>──By the way, I won&#8217;t tell her this even if it kills me, but the reason why I fell in love with older women with big breasts in high school was due to the fact that I met Nene. I was just an adolescent boy during that time, so it was a little too stimulating for me.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuu-Kun, to look at your older sister&#8217;s breast so much…it&#8217;s embarrassing, you know…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, that&#8217;s wrong…!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But Yuu-kun&#8217;s also a boy. There&#8217;s no other way then. Why don&#8217;t you try squeezing them?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, no, no, no! I won&#8217;t do that!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ufufu ♪ I love that kind of innocent reaction. ♪&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, please forgive me…&#8221;</p>



<p>I was already getting a little tired somehow.</p>



<p>Nene chuckled and now turned her attention to Yui.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, Yui-chan, Yui-chan. You like anime and games too, don&#8217;t you, Yui? I like them too, so let&#8217;s be friends~.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yes…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, Yui-chan, are you interested in roses and lilies?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? I-I&#8217;m not much of a flower person…so…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s not what I meant, is it? Oh well, I&#8217;ll just lend you a recommendation later when I have more time, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yes…&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui has been overwhelmed by Nene&#8217;s momentum since a while ago.</p>



<p>Nene, on the other hand, seemed to be in a good mood. Humming, she walked behind Yui and lightly pushed her shoulder.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, let&#8217;s get going then.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Going….? W-Where…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, this is a hair salon. I&#8217;m going to cut your hair, so you can sit on that chair.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……&#8221;</p>



<p>The mention of hair clearly made Yui&#8217;s body tense and stiffened.</p>



<p>Nene saw this and smiled gently.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ve heard about your situation. You have a complex about your white hair, and you get embarrassed when other people see it, don&#8217;t you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;………&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui nodded her head hesitantly.</p>



<p>&#8220;I know what you mean. It&#8217;s scary to be different, isn&#8217;t it? But is that why you&#8217;ve given up on dressing up? If you dress up nicely, it will make you feel more confident, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;B-But…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m a professional in this field, so even though we&#8217;ve never met before, can you trust me? Don&#8217;t worry; I won&#8217;t let you regret it. Okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui looked over at me as if to say, &#8220;What should I do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t worry. My sister may be like this, but you can trust her.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mo, Yuu-kun, you&#8217;re so rude! But he&#8217;s right. I&#8217;m very good at what I do, so don&#8217;t worry about that, kay?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui still looked anxious and gave me a sullen look.</p>



<p>&#8220;Uh….uh…Y-Yuuma …&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yuuma, I want you…to stay by my side. I-It&#8217;s been a long time since I&#8217;ve had my haircut…in a store…so I&#8217;m a little nervous…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, how do you usually cut your hair?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I had my father or mother do it……or I just do it myself…….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh my. Well then, I guess I have a big responsibility. It&#8217;s all about making the customers feel relaxed. What about you? If you want, I can give you a haircut too, Yuu-kun?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……My hair&#8217;s still growing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Okay. Nyufufu ~ ♪. It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve cut your hair…&#8221;</p>



<p>And so the two of us stood side by side, and the haircut began.</p>



<p>Yui, who had a cloth wrapped around her neck like a cloak, was still scared and stiffened as she froze on the chair.</p>



<p>&#8220;If you&#8217;re feeling nervous, you can chat with Yuu-kun, Okay? It&#8217;ll make you feel more relaxed, right? Here.&#8221;</p>



<p>When she handed Yui the phone she had left on the luggage rack, she fluttered and glanced at me.</p>



<p>Additionally, I received my phone and gave a slight nod before I started chatting.</p>



<p>『I haven&#8217;t been to a hair salon in a really long time, so I&#8217;m nervous.』</p>



<p>After such a message, I receive a stamp of a teary-eyed anime character.</p>



<p>『Sorry. Did I push you too hard?』</p>



<p>『That&#8217;s fine, but……why did you bring me all the way to the beauty parlour?』</p>



<p>『There are several reasons, but most of all, I just felt that my own strength was inadequate…so I felt frustrated….』</p>



<p>『Inadequate? Frustrated?』</p>



<p>『You said I don&#8217;t know how your feeling, right?』</p>



<p>『You were worried about that!? It&#8217;s really just something I said, so don&#8217;t worry about it! I&#8217;d rather be the one feeling sorry for myself!』</p>



<p>『No, I don&#8217;t think you really understand what I&#8217;m trying to say. Despite knowing about your complex, I still tried to make you bear your embarrassment so that you could walk out the door. But truth is, I should have tried to make you like yourself more. 』</p>



<p>『That&#8217;s a bit……harsh, don&#8217;t you think? It&#8217;s nothing more than an old complex….』</p>



<p>『I&#8217;ll say it again. You&#8217;re really cute.』</p>



<p>I heard Yui screaming strangely next to me, &#8220;Hui !?&#8221;.</p>



<p>I also felt my face getting hot, but I continued.</p>



<p>『I was really frustrated that someone who didn&#8217;t know you well was saying whatever he wanted and hurting you when you were really a cute and interesting girl. But no amount of words from me will convince you, so I thought I&#8217;d get you cleaned up here and make you admit that you&#8217;re pretty.』</p>



<p>My face was getting hotter and hotter as I typed that.</p>



<p>(……This is bad. I&#8217;m getting more and more embarrassed as I type this. Isn&#8217;t this a very embarrassing thing for me to say? I don&#8217;t want to go back and read what I&#8217;ve typed.)</p>



<p>I sent her a stamp of an anime character blushing and hiding his face with his hand as a sign that I was too embarrassed to go any further.</p>



<p>When I didn&#8217;t get a reply for a while, I glanced to the side and saw that Yui had also covered her face with her hand, just like the stamp I had sent earlier.</p>



<p>『Me too. In fact, I used to hate myself.』</p>



<p>After a while, I received such a reply.</p>



<p>『But after playing with you every day, I&#8217;m starting to like myself a little bit more. I was able to meet Yuuma in real life and tell him that I wanted to be his friend.』</p>



<p>I could feel my heart burning at those words. I glanced to the side again and saw that Yui&#8217;s face was also red, but she was still trying her best to type the message.</p>



<p>『I have a lot of complexes, and there were times when I even wondered why I was born this way. But I was brave enough to become best friends with Yuuma, and I love myself now. I also love Yuuma.』</p>



<p>After that message, an anime stamp with the sticker &#8220;I love you ♡&#8221; was subsequently sent.</p>



<p>I&#8217;m glad…….I&#8217;m so happy that she cared so much about our friendship.</p>



<p>I tried to send a message saying, 『I&#8217;m glad to be your friend to』…… But, I suddenly noticed that Nene had stopped moving her hands.</p>



<p>&#8220;….Onee-chan?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……This isn&#8217;t good, Yuu-kun. I&#8217;m so full of respect that I feel like I&#8217;m going to die a noble death…….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t tell me…you&#8217;ve been stealing glances at our phones again!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Nene hugged me from behind.──Feeling something at the back of my head, a munching sensation, I instinctively screamed.</p>



<p>Nene quickly pulled away from me and hugged Yui this time.</p>



<p>This time, Yui let out an inaudible scream and jittered.</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s impossible! I just can&#8217;t! I&#8217;m really weak to this kind of thing….If anything, this is even more precious than the time I&#8217;ve seen Yuu-kun at his unsociable period. That once timid boy brought back such a cute girlfriend and worked so hard for her…..hah, god.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it isn&#8217;t like that with Yui and me!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, sorry, sorry. As of &#8216;now&#8217;, you&#8217;re still friends, that&#8217;s right. That&#8217;s okay. Onee-chan loves that kind of thing too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nene was already in a state of ecstasy.</p>



<p>──It took her about ten minutes for the work to resume.</p>



<p>The look on her face was unusually serious, as if she was uncomfortable being that way at work.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry, Yui-chan. That&#8217;s how I get when I become excited.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh……um…..but …….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8221;m pretty glad…that you&#8217;re complimenting Yuuma and me on our relationship.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh no. Are you trying to kill me, Yui-chan? You&#8217;re going to make me go &#8216;Kyun-Kyun&#8217; again. Calm down. Calm down me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nene continued to work while mumbling such things.</p>



<p>Although Nene&#8217;s personality was a bit of a mess, her skills were certain. No hesitation was evident in her movements as she cut up Yui&#8217;s hair. Little by little, more silky hair fell to the ground.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;ve got such beautiful hair, and yet you don&#8217;t seem to be paying much attention to it. Your face is all bare, and your clothes are just boorish…plus, you don&#8217;t seem to be caring much about fashion at all, or is it perhaps that you feel too embarrassed to dress up?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Ah…uh…yes…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s no good. Okay? Fashion is like a maiden&#8217;s armament. The more particular she is about it, the stronger she becomes, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;B-But, I&#8217;m….weird and….&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yui said this, Nene softy wrapped her arms around her back.</p>



<p>Instead of the slapstick feeling she felt earlier, it was a gentle embrace, like a mother holding her own child.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yui-chan? From your point of view, do you think it&#8217;s weird that I&#8217;m old enough to wear cosplay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;U-Uhm….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s okay, be honest with me. I won&#8217;t bite.&#8221;</p>



<p>After hesitating for a while, Yui opened her mouth to speak.</p>



<p>&#8220;I think……it&#8217;s cool.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I think it&#8217;s amazing that you can do what you love so openly.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ufufu, you don&#8217;t know that.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nene lightly stroked Yui&#8217;s head.</p>



<p>&#8220;Do you know Yui-chan? Being different doesn&#8217;t mean you&#8217;re inferior.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…….&#8221;</p>



<p>Her words were quiet, but powerful without hesitation. I felt Yui&#8217;s breathe caught at her words.</p>



<p>──In her former days, Nene used to be a serious honour student with irreproachable conduct.</p>



<p>However, she loved cosplaying and secretly worked behind the scenes….One day, she suddenly said that she wanted to pursue a career relating to cosplaying and had a huge fight with her parents, which resulted in her running away from home.</p>



<p>The reason why Nene was so kind to Yuuma and Yui is because of this experience. People who want to change, people who want to step forward, she just can&#8217;t seem to leave them alone.</p>



<p>…Incidentally, after she left home, she set up a store all by herself, which became a big hit. In just a few years, she has become very successful, establishing several branches across japan and making a triumphant return.</p>



<p>&#8220;You should be more confident. You&#8217;re so cute, and you can&#8217;t get hair this beautiful even if you wanted to.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Above all, you have a friend named Yuu-kun who works hard for you. That&#8217;s a great thing to be proud of, isn&#8217;t it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui gave a small nod and glanced at me, her face reddening with embarrassment.</p>



<p>….My cheeks were burning too. But when I nodded to her, she smiled happily and muttered, &#8220;Ehehe!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, it&#8217;s no good. I&#8217;ve been talking about it seriously for quite a while now. Tee-hee♪. Thanks to you, I got to see something good.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, you went out of your way to reserve this whole place just for us. I couldn&#8217;t ask for any more than that, so, thank you….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, I&#8217;m just doing this for my cute little brother and friends.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Nene said that, she stopped her hand and walked to Yuuma.</p>



<p>&#8220;What is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, it&#8217;s just that Yuu-kun can properly speak and look at me now. When I first met you, your eyes were hidden by your bangs, and you looked like a gloomy person with no life at all. But now you&#8217;ve grown up so well.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…… No, I can&#8217;t do anything on my own. After all, I&#8217;m always relying on my big sister like this….Ouch!?&#8221;</p>



<p>A finger was flicked to my head.</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re the one who decided to help Yui-chan. You were the one who actually met her and did all the work. You&#8217;re also the one who bowed to me when you decided that your strength alone wasn&#8217;t enough. So puff out your chest. This isn&#8217;t something that just anyone can do.&#8221;</p>



<p>With a chuckle, Nene resumed her work.</p>



<p>As Yuuma rubbed his forehead, he smiled a little and said,</p>



<p>&#8220;As expected, I&#8217;m no match for my enemy.&#8221;</p>



<p>†</p>



<p>Despite all this, the work continued.</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, you read Maoshitsu too, Yui-chan? I like it too. Which character do you like?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uh……Fee-chan.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Fee-chan is good～. I could feel the yuri vibes coming off of her when she was entangled with Sara-sama.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Uh-huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui was very nervous at first, but she seemed to have relaxed a lot as they talked.</p>



<p>In addition to being a professional, Nene can draw out Yui&#8217;s story very well.</p>



<p>She cut her hair, shampooed her hair, and even did her makeup.</p>



<p>&#8220;Head……light……&#8221;</p>



<p>After the work was done, Yui looked in the mirror and muttered to herself with a somewhat puzzled expression.</p>



<p>She took up a tuft of her hair and smelled it.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s smooth and fluffy……and it smells kind of good…….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ufufu, do you like it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Mmm…….&#8221;</p>



<p>She obviously likes it. When she first came here, she wouldn&#8217;t even look at the mirror, but she now stares at it and views it from every angle possible.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yuuma.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui turned towards me.</p>



<p>──I&#8217;ve always thought that Yui was cute, but now she was on a different level altogether.</p>



<p>A face makeup done by a professional, you could tell that she has put on makeup, but it didn&#8217;t look thick at all.</p>



<p>Her skin was a milky white, making the most of her original skin texture.</p>



<p>Her lips looked soft and cherry-red.</p>



<p>Her hair, carefully shampooed and conditioned, had a light sheen to it and formed an angel ring around the top of her head.</p>



<p>There she was, a beautiful girl without question, reminiscent of the finest dolls he had ever seen on the Internet before.</p>



<p>&#8220;So…how is it?&#8221;</p>



<p>It was different from her usual anxious expression. It was an expression of hope, a desire for someone to call her cute. ….And she wanted that person to be me.</p>



<p>For some reason, the mere thought of that makes my heart pound. However, I couldn&#8217;t seem to get the words &#8216;cute&#8217; out of my mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-Isn&#8217;t it cute?&#8221;</p>



<p>But I managed to squeeze it out, albeit awkwardly.</p>



<p>It sounded even more awkward than usual, but Yui was still happy to hear it. Even mumbling to herself, &#8220;Heh heh.♪&#8221; ….Without knowing why, my sister, Nene, clutched her chests.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad you enjoyed it. Now, all that&#8217;s left is this.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nene handed Yui a paper bag. Yui tilted her head, with a question mark appearing over her head.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll share the shampoo we use at home with you. Next time it won&#8217;t be free, but we do stock it up cheaply for business use, so do come back when you run out.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;O-Oh, but…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, no, really, don&#8217;t hold back. If anything, I should be the one paying you for witnessing something so fantastic today. Ahh, it&#8217;s so nice to be young～♪.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh, uhm….then, thank you for today!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui did her best to raise her voice.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m not really good at this kind of thing, but I had fun today…and Yuuma called me cute…so I&#8217;m happy….&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nfufu, I wonder what this atmosphere is…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If anything, for me, it&#8217;s just the beginning.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Um, what? From now on……?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, once you&#8217;ve done your hair and makeup, clothes are next, no?<br>I mean, having a beauty wear boorish and unrefined clothes makes her seem innocent with personally is totally A-okay to me. After all, we&#8217;re here to dress you up, are we not? Don&#8217;t you want to dress up in all kinds of ways? So, let&#8217;s go, Yui-chan, to infinity and beyond!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, come on, Yuuma～….&#8221;</p>



<p>Nene grabbed Yui&#8217;s arm and took her away.</p>



<p>&#8220;….What are you getting all excited about….&#8221;</p>



<p>Feeling somewhat uneasy, Yuuma followed them.</p>
