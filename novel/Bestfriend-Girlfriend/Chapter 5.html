<h1>Chapter 5: Gal and Light Novel</h1>


<p>Today is a sunny Sunday, and it was a little after 2 o’clock in the afternoon.</p>
<p>I, who had finally received my long-awaited paycheck from my part-time job the other day, had descended from my home in Saitama Shintoshin to Omiya Station.</p>
<p>From there, I made my way to the nearby Animate store.</p>
<p>Alright! Today, my wallet is feeling pretty heavy, so I’m going to buy a bunch of light novels and manga that I’ve been wanting to read.</p>
<p>By the way, the number of books piled up in my room right now is four general literature books, eight light novels, and two manga.</p>
<p>Why do otaku always ignore their stacks of books and go out to buy new books? While pondering about such things, I stepped into the Omiya Animate store.</p>
<p>And there, I saw——A stylishly dressed gyaru named Tsumakawa, with an excited expression like that of a young boy, gazing at the newly released light novels neatly stacked on the shelves.</p>
<p>Wait, Tsumakawa!? What’s she doing in Animate!?</p>

<p>For a moment, I thought that, but come to think of it, she’s Minacho, the light novel reader… It makes sense for an otaku living in Saitama to appear in this area around Omiya Station, where stores like Mate and Melon Books are clustered.</p>
<p>Saitama Prefecture is a kind place for otaku, after all.</p>

<p>So, trying not to be noticed by Tsumakawa, I unconsciously hid behind a bookshelf.</p>
<p>Then, the female store clerk who had been arranging the shelves suddenly spoke to Tsumakawa.</p>

<p>“Welcome. Are you looking for something?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Yuzuppe! Long time no see! Why haven’t you come to see me lately?”</p>
<p>“Well, you didn’t come to the shop. I’ve been working part-time here on Sundays.”</p>
<p>“Huh? But I’m always the one who comes to see you, wouldn’t it be nice if you visited me once in a while too? That’s unfair.”</p>
<p>“What’s unfair about that? We’re just customers and store staff at Animate. It would be weird if I went to see you.”</p>
<p>“Don’t you do novel deliveries or something? Not like regular online shopping, but if I called Yuzuppe, could you provide a service to deliver freshly released light novels within 30 minutes?”</p>
<p>“Freshly released light novels? Don’t get carried away, customer.”</p>

<p>As the Animate store clerk retorted, Tsumakawa chuckled in amusement.</p>
<p>Then, after enjoying a short conversation, they said their goodbyes.</p>

<p>“Well then, I should get back to work.”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Do your best!”</p>

<p>With this exchange, the store clerk returned to sorting the shelves.</p>
<p>As I gazed at this scene, slightly surprised, suddenly Tsumakawa, who had been looking this way, noticed me and exclaimed, ‘Ah!’.</p>
<p>How did she notice me looking at her?</p>
<p>After that, Tsumakawa, for some reason wearing a mischievous grin, approached me, placed her hand on my shoulder, and with a smile, said,</p>

<p>“Oh, you knew I was here? It’s not like I’m invisible to you… am I? …but why didn’t you say anything to me? Hey, why…why, why, why, why, why, why!”</p>
<p>“Whoa, could you please turn off those scary eye highlights and stop coming at me like a yandere!? How are you even doing that?”</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Lv-99/g8.png"/>

<p>“Fufu——I’ve found you, Nezumayo-kun!”</p>
<p>“Stop saying creepy stuff with those eyes! It’s scary!”</p>

<p>As I retorted, Tsumakawa once again burst into loud laughter, seeming to be having a lot of fun.</p>
<p>…Does being a gyaru mean you can have enjoyable conversations with anyone? Share some of those communication skill with me!</p>

<p>“Well then, let me greet you again——Nezumayo-kun, yay!”</p>
<p>“Do you really have to greet me like that…? Fine. Hello, Tsumakawa-san.”</p>
<p>“Nezumayo——No, Yoda. Is it because Yoda-san is a hardcore otaku, that’s why you come here seeking some otaku treasures in the form of light novels? www”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right Www. Also, Tsumakawa-san is a gal, but she loves light novels too, so you can’t really say speak for others, can you? www!”</p>
<p>“That’s true! WWW, this is beyond amusing! WWww”</p>

<p>After saying that, Tsumakawa chuckled at her own words.</p>
<p>What’s with this vibe? While thinking that, I changed the topic and asked her about something that had been bothering me.</p>

<p>“…It’s not really important, but Tsumakawa-san, are you friends with the Animate store staff? How do you become friends with a store staff?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Well, if you go here a few times, you naturally become friendly, right?”</p>
<p>“I can’t grasp the concept of a normalcy of extroverts… Could it be that you have like 300 friends on LINE?”</p>
<p>“Ah, well, I don’t really use LINE much, but I had around 800 mutual followers on Instagram.”</p>
<p>“800!? That’s enough people to build a nation!”</p>
<p>“You’re exaggerating. You’re so surprised that you’re messing up your retorts——Well, now I’ve carefully selected my mutuals and narrowed it down to around 100 people… You know, I realized that among the Insta interactions I’ve had so far, there are a lot of guys I don’t really care about. So now, even if someone asks me if I’m on Instagram, I lie and say I’m not, and I’ve stopped following people frequently. I probably haven’t done the Insta mutual thing in like three billion years.”</p>
<p>“You’re exaggerating the timeframe way too much. Three billion years ago, humans didn’t even exist.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha. But this is serious! I’ve decided I’ll only mutually follow genuine people on Instagram. — In fact, Miona is not the promiscuous type of gal. I’m more of a refined, neat, and tidy type of gal! How about that!”</p>
<p>“Don’t create contradictory statements like Black Mayonnaise… It’s impossible, those two attributes don’t go together.”</p>
<p>“Actually, I’m a virgin! Yay!”</p>
<p>“That’s definitely a lie!”</p>

<p>As I retorted, she laughed again and then said, ‘For now, it’s true though. But, even if I say this, you might not believe me,’ with a mischievous grin.</p>

<p>It’s hard to believe that someone like Tsumakawa, who has probably had around fifty boyfriends, is inexperienced.</p>
<p>In any case, since entering Animate, I’ve mostly observed Tsumakawa and engaged in conversations with her, but I have a goal today.</p>
<p>I reminded myself again that I came here to buy my beloved light novels.</p>

<p>With that in mind, I left her with a simple ‘Well then, I’m going to check out the light novels’ and headed to the new release corner.</p>


<p>Then, Tsumakawa, whom I thought I had said goodbye to, followed me.</p>
<p>Looking at her with a slightly puzzled expression, she seemed angry and said</p>

<p>“Don’t you realize I came to Animate because I also want to buy light novels? Ah?”</p>
<p>“…Don’t so plainly pissed off. I admit the way I phrased it earlier might have come off as dismissive toward Tsumakawa-san… Sorry…”</p>
<p>“If you make me too angry, I’ll hit you with the corner of the dictionary, okay?”</p>
<p>“Hey, cut it out! It would hurt if you hit me with a corner of a dictionary!”</p>

<p>As I said the usual, with my knees trembling in fear, Tsumakawa immediately responded with a bright smile, saying, ‘Alright, but don’t you dare to treat me like that!’</p>
<p>Surprisingly, she seemed to be a gal with good understanding.</p>
<p>And so, following the flow of the conversation, I ended up checking out new light novels together with Tsumakawa.</p>

<p>First, I picked up around three new releases I definitely wanted to buy due to the continuation of a series I liked and summaries that piqued my interest.</p>
<p>Then, there was one more that caught my attention due to the author’s name, so I grabbed that too.</p>
<p>Then, for some reason, Tsumakawa raised her voice a notch and started talking to me.</p>

<p>“Oh, so you’re interested in that one? Customer-san, your eye for detail is quite impressive, huh?”</p>
<p>“Your sudden sales talk is annoying…”</p>
<p>“I read the previous work by this author, ‘Good Night, Zarathustra,’ and it was so good! By the way, Nezumayo, you’ve read it too, right?”</p>
<p>“I have, and it was amazing. I really loved it. I cried like crazy.”</p>
<p>“Right! That’s what I’m saying! It’s like a burst of excitement, a fireworks display, bang-bang, and it’s like a treasure, right?! My excitement goes through the roof!”</p>
<p>“Your wording is a bit too ‘gyaru’ for me to understand, but… yeah! My excitement goes through the roof!”</p>
<p>“Huh? What are you talking about? I don’t know what you mean.”</p>
<p>“You said it first!”</p>

<p>Suddenly having the rug pulled out from under me, I couldn’t help but retort.</p>
<p>This gal, is she not taking responsibility for her own statements?</p>

<p>Then, Tsumakawa suddenly said, ‘Just wait a moment!’ and left with those words.</p>
<p>Not even a minute later, she returned, showing me the cover of a light novel she had brought from somewhere, and continued:.</p>

<p>“Look! ‘Good Night, Zarathustra!'”</p>
<p>“Oh, yeah, that’s right… Both Tsumakawa-san and I already have that book. I don’t really get why you brought a book we already own from the store’s shelves…”</p>
<p>“Just because!”</p>
<p>“Just because, huh? I see…”</p>

<p>She was like an innocent child. It’s a completely meaningless act to go to the bookstore’s shelves to find a book that we already have just to talk about a favorite light novel… but it’s kind of her style to put that into action.</p>
<p>After that, Tsumakawa smiled at the cover of the light novel and continued with a lively voice.</p>

<p>“The scene where Shizuka rejects Yuta’s confession for the sake of her best friend Serina… Isn’t that scene just insane!?”</p>
<p>“Oh, that scene was intense…”</p>
<p>“Exactly!! That scene is seriously all vibes… Shizuka’s the only one who wins, after all…”</p>
<p>“Well, in reality, Shizuka is the losing heroine… but…”</p>
<p>“The losing heroine is the real winner!”</p>
<p>“Don’t create strange phrases. Is that losing or winning? Which one is it?”</p>
<p>“She lost, but she won, right? In fact, she won because she lost! That’s the thing!”</p>

<p>With those mysterious words, Tsumakawa looked at me with sparkling eyes and a genuinely joyful expression, she continued, as if her overflowing emotions couldn’t be contained any longer.</p>

<p>“Nezumayo-kun, did you notice? In that scene, when Yuta praises her ‘cute’ hairpin, Shizuka is actually secretly wearing it! Probably, that hairpin represents Shizuka’s genuine feelings, right? She still likes him! Even though she says, ‘I’m not in love anymore’ and ‘I can move on from a failed romance,’ words can be deceiving, right? So surely, her wearing that hairpin signifies her genuine feelings! Shizuka’s unfeigned emotions!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right…”</p>
<p>“Surely, her emotions are just as strong as Yuta’s! She wants her best friend to be happy, and she wants to be with Yuta! Even so, because she’s kind… Shizuka couldn’t choose to hurt her best friend. So she chose to hurt herself and turned down the confession… I mean, it’s so sad! This light novel is the best! It’s all about the birth of love!”</p>
<p>“That’s true. Even though some mysterious words came up, the emotions are mostly agreeable.”</p>
<p>“And hey, hey! Even the part where Shizuka starts crying is so powerful! When she cries, it’s not before she turns down the confession or after she does… it’s right after she says ‘I’m sorry, I can’t date you!’ It’s like at that very moment, just like how lemon tea overflows from a cup that’s been poured too full, her emotions burst out! Isn’t that so real? At that moment, Shizuka realizes, ‘Ah, I can’t date Yuta…’ She’s aware of it! Is she a literary goddess? Or is it Nishino-sensei who wrote Shizuka that’s the literary goddess? I was also overflowing with tears over here! I thought I’d get dehydrated!”</p>
<p>“Pffft… ahaha…”</p>
<p>“Uhm, why are you laughing? I’m really speaking seriously.”</p>
<p>“N-no, well, sorry… It’s just, you know… I kind of think Minacho-san’s reactions are really nice, and I like it.”</p>
<p>“Huh…”</p>

<p>Taken aback by my statement, Tsumakawa froze for a moment.</p>
<p>Wait, did I just say something creepy…!?</p>
<p>Thinking that, I quickly piled on more words to ensure my feelings were accurately conveyed to her.</p>

<p>“I-I mean, I don’t exactly mean ‘like’… more like, my preference? Minacho-san, or rather, Tsumakawa-san, always expresses her favorite parts of her favorite works, explaining how she likes them and the way her emotions flow, right? I really, really like that…”</p>
<p>“O-Oh, I see…?”</p>
<p>“Seriously, even though you’re a gal, your light novel impressions are amazingly radiant…”</p>
<p>” ‘Even though you’re a gal’, huh? Did you really need that one phrase?”</p>

<p>In response to Tsumakawa’s comment, I found myself almost laughing again as I stared at her.</p>
<p>To be honest, I still found Tsumakawa a bit difficult to deal with. But seeing her like this, I felt a slight sense of relief.</p>

<p>Ah, that’s right, she’s Minacho after all.</p>
<p>Naturally, Tsumakawa and I are quite different in many ways, but when it comes to discussing favorite light novels, she speaks so passionately and quickly that I can’t even interject.</p>
<p>She loves light novels, and in that regard, she’s actually not that different from me – a fellow light novel enthusiast.</p>

<p>Honestly, I think she’s a bit eccentric… She’s an extrovert, yet she doesn’t look down on otaku.</p>
<p>She’s a gal, yet she loves reading light novels. Maybe she’s a gal like a tai-polar chart, having both yin and yang elements.</p>
<p>What kind of gal is that? Ultimately, she might not be a full-fledged gal with a 100% gal level.</p>
<p>Thinking that way, labeling Tsumakawa-san, a gal who loves light novels, as a ‘Gal I find difficult to deal with’ might have been a bit off.</p>

<p>As I pondered these thoughts while looking at Tsumakawa, she suddenly blushed for some reason and said, ‘Hey, stop staring at me,’ before turning her face away.</p>
<p>…???</p>
<p>Why is she reacting with such embarrassment? Getting compliments like this is probably an everyday occurrence for Tsumakawa-san.</p>

<p>Lost in my thoughts, she started playing with the brown tips of her hair</p>


<p>“But isn’t it that there’s no concept of good or bad when it comes to impressions of light novels? There’s just whether it’s good work or not, right?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s not entirely true. — Of course, opinions are a matter of personal preference, but there’s still a sense of whether it’s well-written or not. It’s not just about correct or incorrect grammar in Japanese, but whether emotions are conveyed or not. At least, that’s what I believe.”</p>
<p>“…well, based on that, what do you think of my impressions?”</p>
<p>“They’re full of emotion, and they’re really good. …I genuinely think that, but don’t go fishing for compliments!”</p>
<p>“Haha, you caught on that I was fishing compliments?”</p>

<p>Still blushing, she laughed. Tsumakawa was true to her desires, I thought.</p>
<p>After that, she took out a sparkling pink smartphone from her pocket and looked at it for a few seconds.</p>
<p>Then, while occasionally glancing at me, she asked,</p>

<p>“Hey, how about we become mutuals on Instagram?”</p>
<p>“…Huh? Didn’t you just say something about not doing mutual follows on Instagram earlier?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t say that.”</p>
<p>“You’re just casually lying with a calm face.”</p>
<p>“Well, I just don’t do mutuals with random people. I want to send messages to Nezumayo, my new friend. So, mutuals?”</p>
<p>“…Actually, we’re not exactly friends, though…”</p>
<p>“Huh? Are you still saying such lame things? Come on, take out your phone already.”</p>

<p>After saying that, Tsumakawa stuck her hand into the pocket of my jeans…</p>
<p>‘Where are you hiding it? Seriously, take it out already,’ she said while moving her hand around, exploring my pants pocket. Hey, what are you doing?</p>
<p>No, stop… Don’t touch weird places! You idiot! Pervert!</p>

<p>“Hey, stop it! Seriously, stop it! I’ll take it out myself right now. Don’t go shoving your hand into a guy’s pocket forcibly! That’s practically sexual harassment, you know?”</p>
<p>“Fine, it’s better if you just obediently followed from the beginning…”</p>

<p>“I’m scared, Tsumakawa-san… So gals are actually carnivorous, huh?”</p>
<p>“Huh? I eat mainly salads to maintain this style, you know? So I’m not exactly carnivorous, rawr.”</p>
<p>“Your sentence ended with a carnivorous touch though.”</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’m getting kinda hungry… I wonder if there are any ‘wild otaku’ around here. If there are, I’d totally eat them.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What do you mean by ‘wild otaku’? Just so you know, otaku are basically indoor and frail creatures, so they can’t survive in the wild, okay?”</p>
<p>“Alright, there’s a tasty-looking otaku right around here. Can I eat it?”</p>
<p>“O-oh, come on! Otaku wouldn’t taste good even if you ate them!?”</p>

<p>As I retorted like that, she chuckled while maintaining her grin and playfully urged me again.</p>

<p>“Hey, come on, stop with that! Let’s follow each other on Instagram already!!”</p>

<p>So, in an attempt to resist her even a little bit, I said.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Tsumakawa-san. I don’t really communicate with three-dimensional girls.”</p>
<p>“…You’re still suffering from that illness? Give it a break already.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean, ‘still suffering’? This is my chronic condition, so it won’t go away. In fact, it might even be an incurable disease.”</p>
<p>“Don’t give up on curing it. Go to a big hospital and get it properly checked.”</p>
<p>“You don’t understand, Tsumakawa-san… This condition of mine can’t be cured by modern medicine.”</p>
<p>“Why do you have that smug look on your face? — Anyway, fine, watch out. Someday, I, this gal here, will remind you of the merits of the three-dimensional world. Since it can’t be cured by modern medicine, I’ll personally treat you and maybe even warp Nezumayo’s perspective.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>She said this with a smile. It’s a terrifying proclamation.</p>
<p>Was she trying to crush the core belief of my twisted otaku self?</p>
<p>Then, with a still-beaming smile, she continued speaking in a somewhat sophisticated manner.</p>

<p>“By the way, Nezumayo-kun, you just don’t want to fall in love with real girls and don’t want to be betrayed, right? I don’t really have any romantic motives either. I just want to get along with Yoda, and that’s not about romance… Can’t we exchange contact info at least?”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“Actually, not exchanging contact info is just running away. Isn’t it right for you to stick to your love for two-dimensional even after exchanging contact info with me?”</p>
<p>“..This gal, she’s way too good at punching otaku with righteous arguments…”</p>

<p>After I left that comment, she grinned and flashed a gal peace sign while exclaiming, ‘Yay!’</p>
<p>How is she so adept at having surprisingly well-formed values and opinions when it comes to certain things, even though she usually seems like she’s not thinking about anything?</p>
<p>Thinking in such a way—however, I ended up acknowledging that her reasoning made sense, so I took out my smartphone from my pocket.</p>

<p>Well, exchanging contact info shouldn’t be a big deal.</p>
<p>If replying becomes a hassle, I can always use my tested-and-true ‘Sorry, I was sleeping’ tactic!</p>
<p>By the way, I used this tactic so frequently that once my male friend Koyama scolded me with, ‘You’re asleep to the point of being a Snorlax. When are you not sleeping?’</p>
<p>Sorry about that, Koyama…</p>

<p>Anyway, even though I agreed to exchange contact info, there was one thing I needed to tell her, so I said to Tsumakawa.</p>

<p>“Actually, even before considering mutual or not mutual, I’m not on Instagram…”</p>
<p>“Seriously? High school students not on Instagram are a rare species!”</p>
<p>“Um, I’m really sorry for hitting back so hard, but I seriously am not on it…”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Well, whatever. How about Twitter? But we already exchange messages quite often there… Well then, how about LINE?”</p>
<p>“Well, I do have LINE, technically…”</p>
<p>“Great, let’s exchange Line then! Oh man, it’s been like five billion years since I exchanged LINE with someone!”</p>
<p>“Why do you always make the time frame sound so long when you say things like that, Tsumakawa?”</p>

<p>After that conversation, using QR codes, Tsumakawa and I exchanged Line contact information.</p>
<p>Then, in my Line friends list, a name written in hiragana, ‘Miona’, was added.</p>

<p>We weren’t really friends, so what was she doing on my friends list?</p>
<p>As I was pondering this, Tsumakawa, who would likely have added my name, said while looking at her phone.</p>

<p>“Hey, Nezumayo, your first name is ‘Ryosuke’. Pretty cool, huh?”</p>
<p>“Uh, thank you…”</p>
<p>“Well then, I’m gonna head home now—let’s search for light novels together again sometime, Yoda!”</p>
<p>“O-okay… Huh?”</p>
<p>“Bye-bye! Gal peace!”</p>

<p>With the customary peace sign, she bid me farewell, her cheeks still slightly flushed. And so, she left Animate.</p>
<p>Wait… Tsumakawa was here to buy light novels too, so is it okay for her to leave without buying anything?</p>

<p>With that question in mind, I glanced around where Tsumakawa had been standing until just now.</p>
<p>Right beside the spot was a table, and on it were the three light novels she had probably intended to buy (along with ‘Goodnight, Zarathustra’).</p>
<p>Had she remembered something important enough to forget buying light novels?</p>
<p>Pondering this, I picked up the four books and started to carefully put them back where they belonged in the store.</p>

<p>Oh? If you’re a guy, shouldn’t you have bought the forgotten light novels for Tsumakawa and then handed them to her when you meet her next time?</p>
<p>Well, I’m sorry, but if I did that, I wouldn’t be able to buy the equivalent amount of light novels, so that’s a bit of an unreasonable request.</p>
<p>Please don’t expect an ikemen move from an introverted guy like me!</p>
