<h3>Afterwords</h3>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Acknowledgement </span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I deeply appreciate picking up my work, Confinement King 5.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s your old friend, Masai.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this fifth volume, I&#8217;ve included the first half of the 『Death Game Arc』 which received significant attention on the web version.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I feel like I might have written the same thing in the third volume but erotic scenes always seem to gather towards the latter part of the chapters. In this volume, I&#8217;ve kept the frequency of such scenes lower (though the content is still intense). Instead, the focus has been on enhancing the story&#8217;s depth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Thanks to this, the process of adapting it into a book was quite&#8230; well, not without its challenges.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, this 『Death Game Arc』 involves multiple storylines running concurrently, with numerous intricate foreshadowing elements. I had to ensure consistency as I wrote and I can&#8217;t deny that it was quite a hassle. Along the way, I found myself cursing at my past self during the web version&#8217;s writing phase, saying, 『How complicated can you get, dear self?』 Nevertheless, I managed to complete it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I would be delighted if you enjoy this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And in this fifth volume, the long-awaited mascot character, beloved by readers of the web version, has made an appearance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The instigator who introduced the eroticism of salmon to the world and led this work to be referred to as the 『Salmon Novel』 in certain circles. Yes, that one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this volume, the appearance is just a teaser; the real deal with that character will be in the upcoming volumes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, as usual, whether the sequels will be released depends on the sales. While adding new salmon-related jokes, I hope for the possibility of publishing more sequels.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, I want to express my heartfelt gratitude to everyone, including Editor H and the team at Ichinisanjo Publishing, as well as the incredible illustrations provided by Pei-sensei. Also, thanks to Ashimoto Yoika-sensei and the team at KADOKAWA, who have turned the third volume of the comic adaptation into an outstanding work.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And even after so many volumes, my family and friends who still turn a blind eye, everyone who has read the previous book versions and everyone who has read the web version and shared their thoughts and encouragement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lastly, I sincerely thank you, the person who purchased 『Confinement King 5』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hoping that this work can provide you with enjoyable moments, I offer my greetings in this closing message.</span></p>
