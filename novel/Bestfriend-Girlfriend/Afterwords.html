<h2>Afterword</h2>

<p>Hello, or perhaps I should say, welcome back. This is Haba Rakuto. Thank you very much for reading the third volume of “<em>I Won’t Allow You to Have a Romantic Comedy With Someone Else”.</em></p>



<p>We’ve finally reached Volume 3! As it’s my first time reaching this, my joy is beyond words!</p>



<p>Trilogies, triumvirates, trifectas, the rule of three, three primary colors, the power of three—there’s a richness, stability, and significance to the number 3, right? Isn’t the number 3 wonderful?</p>



<p>Since writing this series, it’s been an incredible journey of one amazing thing after another.</p>



<p>From the series nickname “Watarabu,” chosen through a poll on the Dengeki Bunko official Twitter account, to our first reprint, the double reprint of Volume 1 and 2, to the PV released featuring a stellar cast of voice actors, it’s been a fantastic journey so far!</p>



<p>While I’m celebrating the release of Volume 3, Volume 4 is also expected to be published soon. This is all thanks to the support of our readers. Thank you very much! Please continue to support Volume 4 as well.</p>



<p>Now, let’s talk about the significant milestone that is Volume 3.</p>



<p>With a romcom that begins with a confession, this volume tells the story of a forbidden romantic rival. Arisaka Aria, whose presence has been hinted at since the first volume, finally makes her appearance.</p>



<p>The ideal sister Yorka idolized turns out to be the benefactor of her boyfriend. Aria dramatically changes the dynamics of relationships like a powerful storm and a character I enjoyed writing immensely.</p>



<p>After all, who doesn’t love a beautiful older sister?</p>



<p>From the moment I began writing “Watarabu,” I always knew that Yorka would eventually have to confront Aria. It took three volumes to get to this point. </p>



<p>Yorka was wearing a scowl on the cover of Volume 1, but through the irreplaceable days spent with Kisumi, she has grown significantly.</p>



<p>A girl who struggled with communication, now actively seeks help from others and isn’t afraid to open up about her experiences. </p>



<p>During the sisters’ quarrel in the climax of the story, Yorka completely broke away from the author’s hands and spoke to Aria with words entirely her own. That was truly a remarkable moment. Yorka’s kiss in Volume 3 holds as much significance as Kisumi’s declaration in Volume 1.</p>



<p>Furthermore, the shadow MVP is undoubtedly the protagonist Kisumi. Despite almost appearing in every scene, his role from the shadows truly embodies his character.</p>



<p>As fate would have it for a romcom protagonist, Kisumi is tossed around by numerous temptations. However, it’s because Kisumi unwaveringly remained devoted to his lover that Yorka found the strength to confront Aria.</p>



<p>I believe that this couple, who was deeply in love with each other, has overcome their greatest crisis together. I feel satisfied that I was able to write their kissing scene.</p>



<p>While this story is a work of fiction, I’d like to share a personal anecdote that inspired a scene in the story.</p>



<p>During my junior high days, a young woman worked part-time as a tutor at the cram school I attended. Later on, she became a prominent TV announcer. Despite watching her on TV, it wasn’t until a friend from my cram school pointed it out that I realized who she was.</p>



<p>It’s amazing how memories and impressions can differ, and it shows people change over time.</p>



<p>I’d like to express my gratitude to my editor, Anan-sama. Your consistently insightful advice always ensures the perfect balance between the author’s vision and the final product.</p>



<p>To the talented illustrator, Ikomoji-sama, thank you so much. The inspiration for Kisumi gifting Yorka the necklace came from the commemorative illustration in the official LanoSpo artbook. Your fantastic artwork undeniably enriches the story and provides oundless inspiration. In fact, I find myself eagerly writing just to see your new illustrations. Thank you for your continuous support.</p>



<p>A big thank you to everyone involved in the publication of this book, including the design, editing, and sales teams.</p>



<p>To my family, friends, acquaintances, and colleagues in the industry, thank you for your unwavering support.</p>



<p>On the next page, you’ll find a preview of Volume 4. You can look forward to the highly anticipated swimsuit edition where romance heats up in the midst of summer! </p>



<p>Following their kiss, Kisumi and Yorka’s lovey-dovey antics show no signs of slowing down and reach unprecedented highs. We’ll give you a series of fun-filled summer vacation episodes that are packed with exciting events.</p>



<p>Get ready for the best summer of a romcom couple!</p>



<p>That’s it from Haba Rakuto. Let’s meet again in Volume 4.</p>

<h2>After Story</h2>

<p>And so, summer vacation arrived.</p>



<p>“Why are we even coming to school on the first day of vacation?”</p>



<p>“Just accept it. It’s all part of being the class reps at Eisei High. Let’s do our best together!”</p>



<p>“You seem pretty upbeat, Asaki-san.”</p>



<p>“Not really ♪ ”</p>



<p>While humming, Asaki-san and I met at the school entrance in the morning.</p>



<p>“──How sweet of you. But I won’t let you have things your way!”</p>



<p>Standing there was Yorka in uniform.</p>



<p>“Huh!? Why is Arisaka-san here?”</p>



<p>“Is something going on, Yorka? This is supposed to be a holiday.”</p>



<p>I was just as surprised as Asaki-san since I hadn’t heard of anything from Yorka.</p>



<p>“This is a surprise. Being with you is more fun than staying at home. I brought lunch, so let’s eat together, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>Yorka pulled off a surprise like this was truly unexpected, it showed that she became more confident.</p>



<p>“You’re quite something. I’d say it feels scary rather than cute, though.”</p>



<p>“That’s rich coming from someone who wants to monopolize Kisumi’s time outside of work.”</p>



<p>Even though the two of them were smiling at each other, their gazes were sharp.</p>



<p>“Everyone is pretty lively this morning,” Kanzaki-sensei remarked as she passed by.</p>



<p>After exchanging greetings, she glanced around to ensure no one else was nearby before broaching the subject, “I wanted to express my gratitude for the other day…”</p>



<p>“Sensei, there’s really no need to worry about it.”</p>



<p>“I can’t do that. My mother insists I properly thank the students who helped me. So, would you be interested in visiting our villa during the summer break? The whole building can be reserved and it’s very close to the beach. It’s perfect for some fun.”</p>



<p>“Villa?”</p>



<p>“Reserved?”</p>



<p>“Close to the beach?” </p>



<p>The three of us echoed the keywords that caught our attention.</p>



<p>“Kisumi, I’m fine with it.”</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, of course we’re going, right?”</p>



<p>They were both on board, and naturally, so was I. There was no need to hesitate.</p>



<p>“We’ll go. As the organizer of Sena Club, I’ll quickly confirm the schedules of the other members!”</p>



<p>Just like that, Sena Club’s summer vacation trip to Kanzaki-sensei’s villa was decided.</p>
