<h3>Afterwords</h3>


<p>(Contains spoilers, so it is recommended to read it after reading the main story)</p>



<p>I&#8217;ve been reading this piece over and over again, and I suddenly thought,『Yui is like a mirror』.</p>



<p>Yuuma takes great care of Yui-chan.</p>



<p>Yui responds to that deep affection with deep affection. She&#8217;s affectionate and spoiled, and she returns your affection in the same way you give her affection. She is such a girl.</p>



<p>From here, however, things change little by little as Yui becomes aware of her own romantic feelings.</p>



<p>She becomes aware of Yuuma-kun as a boy, and gets embarrassed to make eye contact with him. But she still wants to be friends with him. She wanted him to be aware of her. She gets bothered when Yuuma-kun speaks to other girls.</p>



<p>She wanted him to realize how she felt. But she was afraid of destroying their relationship. However, she still wanted to get closer to him. …She wanted him to like her as a member of the opposite sex.</p>



<p>Please look forward to Yui-chan, who has become a little selfish.</p>



<p>Acknowledgement</p>



<p>Maruma(まるま)Sensei. Thank you very much for the best illustrations. I fell in love with this illustration at first sight in a social network game, and when the illustrator&#8217;s name was mentioned, I just thought, 『She has to do it!』</p>



<p>I asked the person in charge to request for her, and it was bang on the money. I look forward to more great illustrations in the future.</p>



<p>Mr person in charge. I&#8217;m very grateful for the opportunity to be a part of this project and for all the help I have received since then. It was a pleasure to work with you on this project. I look forward to working with you again in the future.</p>



<p>I would also like to thank the editorial department, the sales department, the designers and everyone involved in this work, and all the readers who have read this far.</p>



<p>Well, that&#8217;s all for now. I look forward to seeing you all again in the second volume. This is Iwatsuka Izuka.</p>
