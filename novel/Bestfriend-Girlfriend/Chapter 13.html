<h2>Chapter 13: A Kiss</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>“It seems like you managed to avoid the arranged marriage, Shizuru-chan.”</p>



<p>“Did you have a good talk with your sister?”</p>



<p>With final exams looming close, the high school students were sent home to study immediately. After having finished everything, Aria and Shizuru were the only ones left in the café at the hotel lounge.</p>



<p>“Our first sisterly quarrel ended in my defeat, more or less.”</p>



<p>“You look rather pleased despite losing.”</p>



<p>“Yor-chan has always been delicate, but she’s oddly stubborn when she sets her mind to something. She’s a bit unbalanced in a different way than me. But now, it seems like she has friends who listen to her advice, which is a relief.”</p>



<p>“And what about him?”</p>



<p>“It goes without saying.”</p>



<p>The cake sets they ordered were brought to the table. Both had chocolate cake, with Aria’s accompanied by iced coffee and Shizuru’s by tea.</p>



<p>“Do you want syrup, Aria? I know you like it sweet.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, but I can drink coffee without it,” Aria held the thin straw in her mouth.</p>



<p>“I see.”</p>



<p>“And don’t you prefer green tea instead of black tea?”</p>



<p>“Black tea is better for cake. Besides, I have enough green tea at school.”</p>



<p>“You know, black tea and green tea are made from the same leaves, just with different fermentation levels.”</p>



<p>“I know,” Shizuru said, moving the fork to her mouth faster than usual.</p>



<p>“Oh, someone is hungry.”</p>



<p>“I’ve been wearing a kimono since the morning and have hardly eaten. And I was so nervous that I couldn’t even eat lunch. But more importantly, how could you betray us like that?”</p>



<p>“I asked your mother not to reveal it…”</p>



<p>“So, how much of this was your plan?”</p>



<p>Shizuru gave her former student a reproachful glance.</p>



<p>“I visited your family home to see what the enemy situation was like firsthand, just in case. And while I was there, I thought I might as well tell them about the stand-in boyfriend. Their reactions were quite amusing,” Aria reminisced with a chuckle.</p>



<p>“You have the guts to manipulate my parents like that.”</p>



<p>“When I told them that their precious daughter suddenly made a move on a student and took him as her boyfriend, your strict mother nearly screamed.”</p>



<p>“I didn’t make a move! But I admit, it would’ve been interesting to see that side of my mother.”</p>



<p>Finally feeling the weight off her shoulders, Shizuru softened her expression.</p>



<p>“Of course, it was all an act. I just wanted to let them know in advance how much you disliked the idea. If Sumi-kun suddenly got exposed as a high schooler during the meeting, I shudder to think what your mother would’ve done.”</p>



<p>“I suppose…”</p>



<p>“You tend to be a bit of a worrywart, Shizuru-chan. Although your mother can be overprotective, she wouldn’t force anything if her daughter was genuinely against it. After all, you’re a competent teacher in your own right. I think she just wanted to meet you under the guise of an arranged-marriage discussion.”</p>



<p>“It would have been easier if her true intentions were a bit clearer.”</p>



<p>“I was also hoping this matter can relieve the tension between you two. If Sumi-kun could persuade them while playing the supportive role, that would’ve been great. And I was also counting on you to spur into action under the pressure. Worst-case scenario, I’d step in to smooth things over if things got out of hand.”</p>



<p>“So, when Hasekura-san and the others showed up…”</p>



<p>“Yeah. It wasn’t my doing; it was a surprise from Sumi-kun and the others. You’re as popular as ever with the students. Amazing!” Aria applauded in a relaxed manner.</p>



<p>“If things didn’t work out, what were you planning to do? It was almost impossible for me to show my face as a teacher again.”</p>



<p>“Well, what could I do? I got unexpectedly held up by Yor-chan,” Aria shrugged, adopting a nonchalant attitude and flipping her hands.</p>



<p>“…Did things go well on your end?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, thanks to everyone’s help,” Aria replied with a bright smile.</p>



<p>“That’s a relief.”</p>



<p>“I didn’t really do much. Yor-chan managed to surpass me on her own. And Sumi-kun and the others’ support played a big part too.” Aria felt a weight lift off her shoulders as various emotions towards her sister were resolved.</p>



<p>“By the way, Aria, there’s something I’ve been meaning to ask you. Why do you call Sena-san ‘Sumi-kun’?”</p>



<p>Aria suddenly fell silent. “Do I have to explain?”</p>



<p>“It’s a good opportunity.”</p>



<p>Shizuru waited for her former student’s answer, who was unusually blushing,</p>



<p>“Well, at first, I just casually called him Kisumi as everyone does. But then I realized Kisumi sounds like ‘KISS ME’ in English. It’s embarrassing, like every time I say his name, it’s like I’m asking for a kiss.”</p>



<p>“That’s quite an innocent reason. And it seems you still harbor some lingering feelings,” Shizuru commented with a cool, indifferent tone.</p>



<p>“I don’t want to hear that from you!”</p>



<p>“When you get all worked up like that, you’re just like your sister.”</p>



<p>Now that Aria had graduated, they had crossed the boundary between student and teacher and remained close friends.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>“Sena-san. Arisaka-san. I have something to say to you both.”</p>



<p>It was the final day of exams. Before the last homeroom ended, we were summoned by Kanzaki-sensei. Today, Yorka unusually followed along obediently.</p>



<p>“I apologize for inconveniencing you with my personal matters the other day. And thank you.” In the tea ceremony clubroom, Kanzaki-sensei served us tea for the first time in a while.</p>



<p>“I’m glad things worked out smoothly.”</p>



<p>I felt relieved while sipping bitter matcha, and that included for having passed the exams.</p>



<p>“Don’t relax too much. If your test scores were bad despite my tutoring, I wouldn’t forgive you,” Yorka warned sternly.</p>



<p>Having been drained of time and mental energy by being a stand-in boyfriend, I was in danger of failing some subjects.</p>



<p>Upon Yorka’s suggestion, we held study sessions with the rest of Sena Club for exam preparation. Nanamura and Sayu, who were also anxious about their studies, agreed and we gathered almost every day after school.</p>



<p>Although Yorka’s guidance was stricter than usual, it felt like life was returning to normal and I was grateful for it.</p>



<p>“I’m sure everything will be fine… probably.”</p>



<p>“Are you really sure?”</p>



<p>“I have no excuse for this matter.”</p>



<p>Even Kanzaki-sensei looked sheepish.</p>



<p>“Seriously, for a homeroom teacher, you’re such a nuisance.”</p>



<p>“Yorka!”</p>



<p>“Oh, come on. My boyfriend was forced to be a fake lover I have every right to complain.”</p>



<p>Both Kanzaki-sensei and I fell silent at her words.</p>



<p>“So, you’re going to continue as our homeroom teacher, right?”</p>



<p>“Of course. Even if Arisaka-san dislikes me, I’ll still be your homeroom teacher.”</p>



<p>“Good then, Kanzaki-sensei.” Yorka’s voice lacked its usual hostility as she addressed Kanzaki-sensei normally.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-san…” Kanzaki-sensei gazed at Yorka with a contemplative expression.</p>



<p>“…I’m fine now.”</p>



<p>“It seems so.”</p>



<p>Yorka met Kanzaki’s gaze and smiled slightly.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center">***</p>



<p>“You’re late, Sena, Arisaka-chan.” As Yorka and I exited the tea ceremony clubroom, Nanamura, Asaki-san, Miyachi, and Sayu were waiting in the corridor.</p>



<p>“Did we make a plan, Nanamura?”</p>



<p>“Sena, it’s natural to have a celebration party after the exams. This is common sense.”</p>



<p>I had no idea about such common sense that was only applicable to those social butterflies.</p>



<p>“At least show some consideration. I’m with Yorka—”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it fine to go once in a while?” Yorka interjected eagerly.</p>



<p>“Huh, is it okay?”</p>



<p>“Anyway, we’ll have plenty of time together during summer vacation,” Yorka asserted, claiming my entire summer break as her own like it was obvious.</p>



<p>“How naive, Arisaka-san. Kisumi-kun won’t have that much free time during summer vacation,” Asaki-san chimed in triumphantly.</p>



<p>“What do you mean, Hasekura-san?”</p>



<p>“In Eisei, class reps get dragged into preparing for the autumn sports festival and cultural festival.”</p>



<p>“What!? Aren’t there separate committees for that?”</p>



<p>“It’s not enough, that’s why class reps get mobilized too. It’s all because your sister expanded the scale of events.”</p>



<p>“Wait, so you mean…” Yorka’s complexion changed.</p>



<p>“Of course, as his partner, I’ll be spending plenty of time with Kisumi-kun during summer vacation!” Asaki-san sported a self-satisfied grin that I’d never seen before.</p>



<p>“<em>Mou</em>! My sister is always in the way!” Aria-san’s influence was truly remarkable; it seemed like she could stir up trouble for Yorka even when she wasn’t around.</p>



<p>“You can only blame yourself for being the little sister of that troublesome sister.” Asaki-san, who still held a grudge against Aria-san for her ruthless behavior in the cafeteria, was not holding back on Yorka with her remarks.</p>



<p>“Asaki-chan, you’re fired up.”</p>



<p>“Asa-senpai, you seem ready for battle.”</p>



<p>Miyachi and Sayu had a complicated smile on their faces.</p>



<p>“That’s irrelevant! Kisumi’s girlfriend is me!”</p>



<p>“Yes, for now. There’s no such thing as a permanent throne in love.”</p>



<p>Yorka and Asaki-san were arguing fiercely right in the middle of the corridor. I was completely ignored.</p>



<p>“What do you think, Sena? Being popular is surprisingly troublesome, huh?” Nanamura wrapped his arm around me sympathetically. His muscles felt heavy.</p>



<p>“Like I care! I’m devoted to Yorka!”</p>



<p>“I’m looking forward to summer vacation.”</p>



<p>“You better stick to basketball practice quietly.”</p>



<p>“Everyone needs a break. I’ll be actively planning events, so be prepared!”</p>



<p>“Oh, then I want to go on a trip! Why don’t we all go somewhere together?”</p>



<p>“Great idea, Yukinami-chan!”</p>



<p>Sayu immediately jumped on board.</p>



<p>“I want to see fireworks!”</p>



<p>“That’s a great idea too, Miyauchi!”</p>



<p>And just like that, my summer vacation plans were filled without my consent.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>During the break in the exams grading period, I enjoyed a long-awaited date with Yorka.</p>



<p>We met up in Shibuya shortly before noon and headed straight to the movie theater. We watched a Hollywood blockbuster action film that kept us on the edge of our seats for over two hours. Afterwards, we discussed our thoughts on the film over a late lunch and then spontaneously decided to go window shopping.</p>



<p>“Oh, that necklace.”</p>



<p>In the department store we stopped by, there was a counter of the same brand as the jewelry store we went to on our previous date. Yorka’s eyes were drawn to the necklace she had admired before.</p>



<p>“It’s still so cute,” Yorka murmured as she gazed at it in the display case.</p>



<p>Right next to her, I decided to take a bold step.</p>



<p>“Excuse me, I’ll take this necklace, please!” The price was within the range of what I had earned from my part-time job last year.</p>



<p>“Wait, Kisumi!?”</p>



<p>“I’ll buy it for you.”</p>



<p>“It’s okay. You don’t have to do that.”</p>



<p>“But you like it, right? I think it suits you, I want you to wear it.”</p>



<p>“But I feel bad.”</p>



<p>“It’s a token of apology for making you worry.”</p>



<p>“…Are you sure?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, if I’m going to give you your first gift, it should be this necklace.”</p>



<p>As the clerk started to wrap it, Yorka said, “I’ll wear it right away.”</p>



<p>In the summer sunlight, the necklace around her slender neck sparkled brightly.</p>



<p>“Thank you, Kisumi. I’ll treasure it.”</p>



<p>“I’m glad you liked it.”</p>



<p>“Yeah,” Yorka was in an exceptionally good mood, “I want to thank you, too.”</p>



<p>“Just having a summer date with you is more than enough.”</p>



<p>“That doesn’t feel fair.”</p>



<p>“Hmm, it’s tough to think of one.”</p>



<p>“Kisumi, you’re too kind and selfless, and that can lead you to trouble. If there’s something you want, you should tell me. It would put my mind at ease too!” Yorka fixed me with a sharp, determined gaze.</p>



<p>“I can’t think of anything I want right away.”</p>



<p>“It doesn’t have to be a material thing!”</p>



<p>As we waited for the traffic lights to change at the scramble crossing, I pondered. If Yorka was willing to get me a gift, it should be something special.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I realized what I had been curious about but hadn’t yet gotten.</p>



<p>That’s it. There was no doubt that’s what I wanted.</p>



<p>But could I say it right here in the middle of Shibuya? Honestly, I felt embarrassed.</p>



<p>“Looks like you’ve got something in mind.”</p>



<p>“You’re sharp.”</p>



<p>“I can see right through you.”</p>



<p>“Then, take a guess.”</p>



<p><em>If you understand, please spare me the explanation.</em></p>



<p>“I want to read you better, so look this way.”</p>



<p>“Are you a mind reader?” As instructed, I turned towards Yorka. In the next instant, her lips met mine.</p>



<p>The hustle and bustle of the city faded away along with the heat, leaving only the sensation of our lips touching.</p>



<p>Amidst the crowd waiting at the traffic lights, we shared a kiss.</p>


<div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1000011629.png" alt="" /></div>


<p>“Is this the right answer?” Yorka asked me shyly.</p>



<p>We were outside and surrounded by people, yet Yorka initiated the kiss herself.</p>



<p>“…This isn’t a dream, right?”</p>



<p>“Who knows?”</p>



<p>As the signal turned green, the world began to move again. </p>



<p>Yorka walked ahead with light steps. Her hand remained tightly clasped with mine, unwilling to let go.</p>



<p>“Yorka!”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“I love you!”</p>



<p>“I love you too, Kisumi!”</p>



<p>Summer vacation for the lovers was just around the corner.</p>
