<h2>Chapter 11: It’s Difficult Because of Love </h2>



<p>Finally, the big day arrived.</p>



<p>The venue was a renowned hotel in Tokyo with a beautiful garden.</p>



<p>“You two look fantastic!”</p>



<p>Shizuru-san was draped in an elegant kimono. Her long black hair, which was meticulously styled, exuded beauty.</p>



<p>I, on the other hand, wore a suit Aria-san and Shizuru-san had picked out at the department store beforehand. Wearing such attire that I wasn’t used to and having my hair neatly styled made me feel like a different person.</p>


<div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/1000011151.png" alt="" /></div>


<p>Today, I was the college student Sena Kisumi, playing the role of Kanzaki Shizuru’s boyfriend with the premise of marriage.</p>



<p>Despite multiple trips to the restroom, I couldn’t shake off my nervousness.</p>



<p>“Come on, your faces are too stiff. You had the night training for a reason. It won’t mean anything if you can’t relax and pull it off today.”</p>



<p>“Aria-san, your choice of words…”</p>



<p>“It’s inappropriate.”</p>



<p>Her easygoing words managed to ease our tension, if only slightly.</p>



<p>“You’ll be fine. No matter whether you cry or laugh, today marks the end. Pull yourselves together and play the part of a devoted couple.”</p>



<p>“Aria-san, thanks for everything,” I expressed my gratitude in advance.</p>



<p>“I’m the one who dragged you into this mess, so thank you for going along.”</p>



<p>“How about joining us for the main event too?”</p>



<p>“I’ll pass.”</p>



<p>“You’re unusually reserved today.”</p>



<p>“I have my reasons,” Aria-san vaguely replied.</p>



<p>“Once this is over, let me thank you too,” Shizuru-san offered.</p>



<p>“Oh, how about a trip for summer vacation? Staying at your villa will be great, Shizuru-chan!”</p>



<p>“Aria, are you still planning to drag him along?” Shizuru-san expressed her exasperation at Aria-san’s nonchalant attitude.</p>



<p>“I didn’t say I’d bring Sumi-kun along. Oh, Shizuru-chan, you’re so naughty~” </p>



<p>“Th-that’s not what I meant!” Shizuru-san panicked as she fell into Aria-san’s playful trap.</p>



<p>Suddenly, a notification chimed from my phone in my pocket.</p>



<p>“Sumi-kun, please remember to put it on silent. It’d be off-putting if it rings while you’re talking.” </p>



<p>“Sorry. I’ll do it right away,” I responded, quickly silencing the device and tucking it away.</p>



<p>“It’s a bit early, but shall we go, Shizuru-san?” </p>



<p>I glanced at the watch I borrowed from my father. The appointed time was approaching.</p>



<p>“Yes. I’ll be counting on you, Kisumi-san,” Shizuru-san said and lined up beside me.</p>



<p>“I wish you both the best of luck.”</p>



<p>Aria-san bid us farewell from the lobby as we made our way to the designated restaurant.</p>



<p>The Japanese restaurant within the hotel was our destination. We were escorted to a quiet private room overlooking the Japanese garden.</p>



<p>Shortly after we took our seats, a well-dressed couple in kimonos arrived. At the moment I laid eyes on them, I felt the urge to flee from their imposing presence.</p>



<p>Firstly, the father was downright intimidating.</p>



<p>His thick hair was shaved short, and he had deep wrinkles between his eyebrows. His eyes were sharp and fierce, and the corners of his mouth were turned down. He looked perpetually displeased. His large, sturdy figure was evident even beneath the formal kimono, and the gold-shining luxury watch on his thick wrist added to his imposing presence.</p>



<p>If I had to be frank, was he a yakuza boss?</p>



<p>Even though I just went to the restroom, I feel like I need to go again.</p>



<p>Beside him stood Shizuru-san’s mother, a graceful beauty who looked stunning in her kimono. Her dignified appearance, which resembled Shizuru-san but with the weight of years, almost made me want to bow and address her as “Madam.” Her sharp, determined gaze and unwavering presence were even more formidable than her daughter’s. It made me realize just how kind Shizuru-san had been to us as students. It was understandable that Shizuru-san, raised under such a strict mother, turned out to be serious and meticulous. If you went against her, you wouldn’t want to know the consequences.</p>



<p>Yeah, she was definitely the wife of a yakuza boss.</p>



<p>Were there any underlings waiting behind the door?</p>



<p>Facing Shizuru-san’s parents, who looked even stricter than I had imagined, in my precarious position as a stand-in boyfriend… What would happen if my lies were exposed?</p>



<p>Could I make it out of here alive?</p>



<p>“Mother, Father, it’s been a while,” Shizuru-san rose and bowed respectfully. I followed suit.</p>



<p>“You seem well, Shizuru-san. You should visit home more often instead of burying yourself in work. Right, dear?” </p>



<p>“Hmm.” The father, with crossed arms, grunted in acknowledgment without sparing me a glance. The conversation seemed to be led by the mother. </p>



<p>Marrying someone as intimidating as her husband, Shizuru-san’s mother must be quite formidable herself. </p>



<p>The atmosphere between the reunited family lacked warmth, bordering more on an intimidating interview.</p>



<p>“So, are you the one dating Shizuru-san?” </p>



<p>Despite being obvious since I was present, it was clear that my presence wasn’t exactly welcomed.</p>



<p>“Y-Yes! He is Se—I mean, K-Kisumi-san.”</p>



<p>Shizuru-san was visibly tense! </p>



<p>We barely made it past the greetings. The dignified figure from the classroom was nowhere to be seen. Shizuru-san was ten times more nervous than I anticipated. Her voice trembled, and she struggled to catch her breath. </p>



<p>Did she really get this awkward with her own parents? Hey, Aria-san, things were looking pretty bad from the start! </p>



<p>Although I silently complained to the one who dragged me into this mess, she obviously couldn’t hear me.</p>



<p>“What happened to you all of a sudden? How can you be a teacher when you stutter like this?”</p>



<p>Like a frog being stared down by a snake, Shizuru-san was shrinking further. I couldn’t bear it and decided to introduce myself.</p>



<p>“Allow me to introduce myself. I’m dating Shizuru-san, my name is Sena Kisumi. Nice to meet you. Thank you for your time today. I’ve been looking forward to meeting you both.” I tried my best to come off as a good-natured young man.</p>



<p>“You’re quite young, aren’t you? You look like a high school student,” she pointed out suddenly.</p>



<p>“I-I have a baby face! That’s why Shizuru-san initially didn’t take any notice of me.”</p>



<p>“Where did you meet Shizuru-san?” </p>



<p>“At a university seminar gathering. Graduates were there, and among them was Shizuru-san. I fell in love at first sight. I pursued her relentlessly and we started dating,” I replied, sticking to the script Aria-san had drilled into me. </p>



<p>I sacrificed my study time for final exams to memorize Sena Kisumi’s fictional background as a university student. <em>Bring it on. I’ll navigate through it all.</em></p>



<p>Her mother observed me for a moment before turning to Shizuru-san. “What attracted you to him?”</p>



<p>“U-um, he…”</p>



<p>“Can’t you answer why you like him?”</p>



<p>There was barely a moment to breathe since the last question. How fast-paced did her mother want this to be? </p>



<p>It was hard to communicate when you were constantly cut off before you could express yourself. </p>



<p>Yeah, having a decent conversation was proving quite difficult. Wasn’t this event already a lost cause?</p>



<p>“Pardon me. We’ll bring your meals shortly,” a hotel staff member intervened at a perfect timing.</p>



<p>Alright, this was a chance to break the current flow. Hopefully, Shizuru-san could gather herself mentally during this break.</p>



<p>As the lunch banquet began, a lavish bento box filled with various delicious dishes was brought in.</p>



<p>“Shall we dig in?” </p>



<p>Taking her mother’s words as a cue, we started our meal.</p>



<p>Normally, I’d be excited about hotel food, but nerves had overridden any sense of hunger. I tried to eat, but the flavors didn’t register.</p>



<p>What a waste. This was truly disappointing.</p>



<p>“Mother,” Shizuru-san began with a deep breath. “Kisumi-san is a kind person who can’t ignore when others are in need. He selflessly helps them without considering his own gain. I trust and respect him for his earnestness. He’s a wonderful man whom I can confidently introduce to both of you.”</p>



<p>Even if it was just part of the stand-in boyfriend act, it felt good to receive praise from Shizuru-san.</p>



<p>“Indeed, this is the first time you’ve brought a lover.”</p>



<p>“Yes, and I’m serious about him,” Shizuru-san replied confidently.</p>



<p>Her mother exchanged a glance with the father who remained silent, then turned back to me. “As parents, all we want to know is if you are suitable as Shizuru-san’s husband.”</p>



<p>“I may be inexperienced, but my feelings for the person I love are unwavering.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that a given?”</p>



<p>“Then, what do I need to say for you to approve our relationship? Should I discuss my academic history or future career plans?”</p>



<p>“Such details can easily be checked by a detective agency. There’s no need to discern lies.” </p>



<p>Her mother showed no favor towards her daughter’s suitor.</p>



<p>No, I was just the stand-in boyfriend.</p>



<p>“What specifically drew you to our daughter?” </p>



<p>“Shizuru-san is incredibly thoughtful and considerate. She’s observant, notices others’ concerns, and offers support before I even ask. She’s always there to listen and advise, though she scolds me often. When I’m uncertain, she gently nudges me forward. Personally, she’s helped me countless times.”</p>



<p>I reflected on my experiences as her student.</p>



<p>Early in my high school life, I was suddenly appointed class representative and struggled with the numerous events. I wasn’t the type to take the lead and direct others, but persistence was key. Even though it was tough, I gained some confidence. </p>



<p>Then before summer, there was a problem with the basketball team. I had no regrets, but I felt bad that Sensei had to worry about it for so long. </p>



<p>And then there was the matter with Yorka. </p>



<p>I wouldn’t forget the kindness Kanzaki Shizuru showed me. That’s why I was going along with this crazy plan of being her stand-in boyfriend.</p>



<p>“I’m glad that you have a good impression of Shizuru-san. But, is there anything about her you’d like to see improved?” </p>



<p>“Something to improve?” </p>



<p>“Just because you love someone doesn’t mean you have to accept everything about them. Of course, forgiveness is essential, but being able to discuss things you can’t forgive is the most important.” </p>



<p>I noticed that her mother’s way of speaking was just like Kanzaki-sensei in the classroom. It felt strange to have the real Shizuru-san right beside me.</p>



<p>Somehow, it felt like talking to a teacher in the classroom, and my nerves calmed down.</p>



<p>“I can’t think of anything—oh, except for one thing. When she drinks, her face doesn’t change at all. Then suddenly, she hits her limit, so please drink in moderation next time.”</p>



<p>I shared my impression at Shizuru-san’s house the other day honestly.</p>



<p>“W-Wait, Kisumi-san!?” </p>



<p>Shizuru-san’s composure shattered with my unexpected revelation.</p>



<p>“Haha, she’s just like her mother, isn’t she?” Unexpectedly, a hint of approval came from her father.</p>



<p>“My situation is irrelevant right now.” </p>



<p>With a quiet reprimand, Shizuru-san’s father immediately fell silent. It seemed he was firmly under her control.</p>



<p>“Please be more careful outside, Shizuru-san.”</p>



<p>“Yes,” Shizuru-san responded with genuine remorse.</p>



<p>“You were able to lie down right away last time because it was at home, right?” </p>



<p>I dared to say it to emphasize we were a couple, but both parents were taken aback as soon as they heard it.</p>



<p>“Did you let him into your house?” </p>



<p>Her mother’s voice was more tense than ever. It wasn’t the intimidating tone from before; it was real concern. Next to her, the father crossed his arms with his eyes narrowing.</p>



<p>Shizuru-san also sensed the shift in her mother’s demeanor and hesitated on how to respond.</p>



<p>“Answer me. Did he really come to your house?” Her mother repeated the question.</p>



<p>Shizuru-san glanced at me, silently pleading for help. <em>What should we do? </em></p>



<p>Before I could muster a response, her mother’s words froze us in place.</p>



<p>“Even if he were your real boyfriend, allowing a high school boy into a teacher’s home is beyond inappropriate!”</p>



<p>Kanzaki Shizuru’s parents knew Sena Kisumi’s true identity!</p>



<p>“What is this about? I—” I began to deny, but was swiftly cut off.</p>



<p>“The charade ends now. Sena Kisumi-kun, you’re a student in Shizuru-san’s class, correct? It’s commendable to care for your homeroom teacher, but no matter how hard you try, you don’t appear like you’re over twenty. Your manner of speech is also quite forced.”</p>



<p>“Was it Aria Arisaka who informed you?” I immediately suspected the source.</p>



<p>“Yes. She paid us a visit the other day and disclosed everything.”</p>



<p>Her mother’s admission left Shizuru-san visibly shaken. Arisaka Aria, our once-cooperative ally, had been informing Shizuru-san’s parents behind the scenes.</p>



<p>However, now wasn’t the time to ponder Aria-san’s motives or provide comfort to Shizuru-san. I had a message to convey, one that couldn’t wait.</p>



<p>“…I apologize for deceiving you. I’m truly sorry. Please, allow me to speak to you once more as one of Kanzaki-sensei’s students. I wish to continue learning from her.”</p>



<p>Continuing to deceive them here would only exacerbate the situation. I attempted to persuade them as the real Sena Kisumi and spoke from the heart.</p>



<p>“Sena-kun, it might just be three years of high school for you, but for my daughter, it’s a lifelong matter.”</p>



<p>“But isn’t it overly intrusive for parents to decide their children’s marriages in this day and age?”</p>



<p>Even though I knew it sounded rude, holding back would only backfire. I decided to speak my mind without hesitation.</p>



<p>“I understand. If Shizuru-san could find her own marriage partner, I wouldn’t interfere. But she’s someone who’s grown up beautifully, yet I’ve never heard of any romantic involvements during her student days, and even as a working adult, she’s all about her job.”</p>



<p>“She’s found her calling and is devoting herself to it. I think that’s admirable!”</p>



<p>“That’s precisely why Shizuru-san, in her late twenties, should be seriously considering marriage.”</p>



<p>“The timing should be up to her. Besides, getting married doesn’t guarantee happiness.”</p>



<p>“That’s why it’s crucial to choose a reliable partner.”</p>



<p>We were at an impasse in this discussion. It was an endless back-and-forth as we were trying to define happiness with no clear answer. </p>



<p>I knew I, as a high schooler, wasn’t being taken seriously. However, if Kanzaki-sensei still wasn’t ready for marriage, I would stand on this side and argue passionately on her behalf.</p>



<p>“Parents and children are separate entities.”</p>



<p>“A suitable marriage partner isn’t something you find immediately. It might be too late to start looking.”</p>



<p>“But that’s imposing your values onto your daughter.”</p>



<p>“Then, can you take responsibility and ensure her happiness?” </p>



<p>“That’s…”</p>



<p>“You can’t, can you? Because you’re still a child. And you probably have a girlfriend too. If you’re serious, you should break up with her.”</p>



<p>Faced with the harsh reality, I couldn’t muster a response.</p>



<p>“—You’re an outsider because you can’t take responsibility.”</p>



<p>Her mother dismissed me outright.</p>



<p>“No matter how much you support her, there’s nothing you can do at this crucial moment. And as her parents, we have a responsibility to our grown daughter. We want her to live happily from the bottom of our hearts.”</p>



<p>They weren’t pressuring marriage abruptly. It was pure concern for their child’s future and that’s why they had to meddle.</p>



<p>Just like how my mother was concerned whether I was studying for my exams, it was probably an extension of those emotions. They weren’t trying to force Kanzaki-sensei into a rigid mold of values. I understood that clearly from our conversation.</p>



<p>At the same time, overturning the established power dynamic between parents and their adult child, who they had raised over the years, wasn’t easy. As their daughter, Kanzaki-sensei still couldn’t speak up to her parents.</p>



<p>“I thought you came prepared to convince us since you’re going as far as bringing a fake boyfriend. But in the end, he’s the only one talking.” Her mother sighed as if disappointed. </p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei remained silent, her face hidden.</p>



<p>─Sometimes, things didn’t always go smoothly because of how deeply you loved them. </p>



<p>You become too aware of the other person and unable to act appropriately. It was a common phenomenon, not just in love. </p>



<p>But unlike romantic relationships, you couldn’t easily distance yourself from family. Just because you were family didn’t mean you could say everything, and there were things left unsaid.</p>



<p>“Unfortunately, I have no interest in lecturing someone else’s child. Let’s wrap it up today. We’ll discuss your arranged-marriage later, Shizuru-san.”</p>



<p>“Wait, please!” I stopped Kanzaki-sensei’s parents from leaving.</p>



<p>“…Sena-san, it’s okay.”</p>



<p>“I’ll regret it for the rest of my life if I give up now!”</p>



<p>“You’ve done well on your own.”</p>



<p>“…If I’m not enough on my own, then I’ll borrow everyone’s strength.”</p>



<p>I pulled out my phone and made a call, “Come right now.”</p>



<p>“We’re already here.”</p>



<p>Simultaneously with the reply, the door swung open. Showing up outside the door were everyone from the Sena Club.</p>



<p>“Sorry for the intrusion!” </p>



<p>Nanamura boomed in with a spirited greeting typical of a sports team member. Miyachi and Sayu followed suit.</p>



<p>“You took your sweet time calling, Kisumi-kun. We thought you didn’t need us,” Asaki-san said while holding her phone.</p>



<p>I locked eyes with Miyachi. Her gaze conveyed reassurance. </p>



<p><em>Alright, I’ll leave it to them.</em></p>



<p>Meanwhile, Yorka was settling another matter in a different place.</p>
