<h2>Chapter 11: Although I’m Happy, The Holiday Is Even More Fun</h2>


<p>Finally, a holiday date with Yorka arrived.</p>



<p>I woke up even before my smartphone’s alarm went off, having prepared everything from clothes to essentials the day before. After changing, I checked the weather forecast on TV while having breakfast. It was a clear day today – the perfect weather for a date.</p>



<p>“Alright, the weather is perfect.”</p>



<p>“Hey, Kisumi-kun. Why are you up so early today?” asked Ei curiously as we ate breakfast together.</p>



<p>“I have a date with Yorka today.”</p>



<p>“Nice! I want to go too!”</p>



<p>“You have your extracurricular activity. Are you thinking of skipping them?”</p>



<p>“It’s not fair that only Yorka-chan and Kisumi-kun get to go on a date.”</p>



<p>“It’s not. Taking my little sister on a date during holiday is practically a punishment.”</p>



<p>“Yorka-chan would be happy.”</p>



<p>My sister asserted confidently, far too self-assured in her beloved character. Well, Yorka did like Ei, so it should be fine. However, at least on the first holiday date, I wanted to leave happy memories of the two of us alone.</p>



<p>After seeing Ei off to her extracurriculars and cleaning up after breakfast, the doorbell rang. It was Sayu.</p>



<p>“Good morning, Ki-senpai.”</p>



<p>“Morning, Sayu. What’s up?”</p>



<p>“I brought a little something as a thank-you for the souvenir you gave me last time. My mom baked cookies, so I came to deliver them.” Sayu handed me a paper bag. Inside, I found carefully wrapped homemade cookies.</p>



<p>“They look delicious as ever. Thanks.”</p>



<p>“No problem. The hot spring manju you gave me was delicious too. Thank you.”</p>



<p>After expressing her gratitude, Sayu scrutinized my outfit. “Are you going on a date with Yor-senpai? Looks like you’ve put a lot of effort into dressing up.”</p>



<p>“Well, yeah.”</p>



<p>“…Are you, by any chance, nervous?”</p>



<p>“Of course I am. Hey, do I look okay? Is there anything weird about my outfit?”</p>



<p>Having known each other for so long, Sayu saw through me effortlessly. I found myself instinctively seeking a fashion check from her.</p>



<p>“Even if it’s tacky, you can just let Yor-senpai coordinate and buy clothes for you, right?”</p>



<p>“How rude! Any advice that isn’t just snarky comments?”</p>



<p>“Hmph! You’ve at least cleared the minimum fashion standards. Anything more and my preferences would kick in!”</p>



<p>Surprisingly, she was genuinely considerate.</p>



<p>“Is that so?”</p>



<p>“It would be unpleasant if you show up on a date wearing an outfit coordinated by another girl’s taste. Especially if it’s Yor-senpai, she’d notice for sure.”</p>



<p>“My bad.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. Yor-senpai genuinely likes you.” Sayu reassured me, easing my tension with her straightforward approval. It was like the good old days.</p>



<p>“That’s true.”</p>



<p>“Aw, how romantic! Dates with a lover seem so fun!”</p>



<p>“Sayu.”</p>



<p>“What is it? Still want advice?”</p>



<p>“…Thanks.” Sayu lowered her eyes for a moment and then grinned. “Just make sure not to disappoint and get dumped right after the date starts.”</p>



<p>“I’ll be careful.”</p>



<p>“If the Sena club ever plans another gathering, be sure to invite me!”</p>



<p>“…Hey, can’t we drop that name? Can’t we at least go for Nanamura club?”</p>



<p>“Pfft! That wouldn’t make any sense. Your presence is what brings those people together, whether there are romantic feelings or not!”</p>



<p>When Sayu put it that way, I couldn’t really argue. Perhaps I was just imagining some unsettling undertones.</p>



<p>Naming relationships was actually quite a significant matter. Simply having a label created a stronger bond. I had been clear about my relationship with Yorka by announcing us a couple. Similarly, the gathering called “Sena Club” brought together Sayu and other students from different grades and strengthened their connections.</p>



<p>“Well then, please take good care of Yor-senpai!”</p>



<p>Cute, but somewhat cheeky, Sayu spoke with a smile as she left.</p>



<p>“Now, it’s time to go.” I walked alone to the local station. Riding the train, I reached the nearest station to our meeting place. I made my way towards our designated meeting spot while navigating through the crowded streets.</p>



<p>Within the bustling crowd, there was a strangely vacant space amidst the sea of people. Standing in the center was an exceptionally beautiful girl.</p>



<p>Arisaka Yorka was already waiting. Seeing Yorka outside of school gave me a refreshing feeling. It was the first time I had seen her in casual clothes, and they suited her exceptionally well. People passing by couldn’t help but be drawn to Yorka, regardless of gender.</p>



<p>However, Yorka stood there appeared somewhat lost. She was clearly not accustomed to being alone in such a busy area. I glanced at the wristwatch on my hand. There was still more than thirty minutes until our agreed meeting time.</p>



<p>“She couldn’t wait, huh?”</p>



<p>We were in the same boat.</p>



<p>Yorka suddenly looked up, and as soon as she spotted me in the crowd, a radiant smile bloomed on her impeccably crafted face.</p>



<p>I sprinted straight toward her. Today marked the long-awaited holiday date.</p>
