<h3>Interlude 2 - Something I'm able to Return</h3>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m home.&#8221;</p>



<p>As soon as Yui entered the house, her father and mother came to greet her at the door.</p>



<p>&#8220;Welcome home, Yui. You&#8217;re back pretty late.&#8221;</p>



<p>The kind father looked relieved that his beloved daughter had returned safely.</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I&#8217;m sorry. Did I worry you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No…Oh? Did you cut your hair?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. My friend took me to a beauty parlour.&#8221;</p>



<p>When Yui said this, her mother smiled happily.</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, I&#8217;m glad that Yui has a friend like that.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. He&#8217;s my best friend. He&#8217;s very kind…and I love him♪.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh-oh. I can&#8217;t believe Yui said such a thing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, you must be hungry. Would you like to eat?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes!&#8221;</p>



<p>And so, the three family members sat down at the table to eat their dinner together.</p>



<p>In it, Yui was happily recounting the events of the day.</p>



<p>&#8220;Then I went to get a haircut with my friend, oh yeah, we both did our makeup…and I also learned how to take care of my hair. Right away, today was the day I thought I&#8217;d give it a try.&#8221;</p>



<p>The father and mother were smiling and listening to their beloved daughter.</p>



<p>They were worried. At any rate, Yui had never been able to go to school very often, and she had a communicative disorder that made it difficult for her to talk to others.</p>



<p>They were afraid that she wouldn&#8217;t be able to make friends in high school or worse; she would get bullied.</p>



<p>However, she seemed to have made some good friends before entering high school. To be honest, they were a little worried when they were told that she was going to meet a friend on the internet, but they were relieved to hear that Yui was being taken care of.</p>



<p>Surely, it must&#8217;ve been a 〝Big sisterly girl〟, they imagined.</p>



<p>&#8220;But Yui. No matter how much fun it is to play with that friend, you shouldn&#8217;t stay up too late, okay? Especially with all the disturbances recently.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm. But it&#8217;s okay. My friend always sends me home.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But then your friend would be alone until she got home, right? From what I&#8217;ve heard, she seems like a strong girl, but still, a girl walking alone at night is……&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;? The friend I&#8217;m talking about is a boy, though?&#8221;</p>



<p>The moment she said that, her father blinked in surprise.</p>



<p>&#8220;……Huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? Didn&#8217;t I tell you? My friend, is a boy named Sugisaki Yuuma?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, dear!&#8221;</p>



<p>At these words, her mother&#8217;s eyes sparkled as she covered her mouth, while the father&#8217;s mouth fell open for a moment, in complete contrast to mother&#8217;s actions.</p>



<p>After a few seconds, he composed himself and let out a loud cough.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait, wait, wait. Um…in other words, what is it. So now you&#8217;re telling me that the boy you&#8217;ve been going out with to play every day is this Yuuma Sugisaki-kun?&#8221;&#8216;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yes, but…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You mean to tell me that this was the boy you&#8217;ve been hanging out with in a private room in an internet cafe, clinging your arms together as you walk back?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;B-By the way, it didn&#8217;t go any further than that, did it? Like going to the other party&#8217;s house and so on…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, I did, but…&#8221;</p>



<p>Finally, the dad froze.</p>



<p>The appearance of Yui was like saying, &#8220;What&#8217;s going on?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, um…what was it. Yui, the boy, known as Sugisaki Yuuma, do you like him?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;? Yeah, I like him.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I see. W-Well, Yui will soon be a high school student. But, um….going to the other party&#8217;s house…that wasn&#8217;t a mistake, was it?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A mistake?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui tilted her head at her father, who was acting strange.</p>



<p>And then she thought about it for a moment…and started to flutter when she realized what her father was worried about.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s not like that, okay? Yuuma is my friend, and when I say I like him, I mean as a friend, and I only went to his house because it was raining and I got wet, so I borrowed his shower…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You showered at a man&#8217;s house!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-That&#8217;s why Yuuma&#8217;s just my friend, not like how father thinks….!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…..Kohon. Yui.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui&#8217;s father cleared his throat and started talking with a mysterious look on his face.</p>



<p>&#8220;Listen, Yui? Yui is a girl, and not long later, you&#8217;ll be a high school student. Thus, you&#8217;ll be a little defenceless, so you have to start being wary of men…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;U-Uh, huh.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;And this Yuuma seems to be very kind to Yui, but there has always been a saying that a man is a wolf. In most cases, men are usually kind to women when they have an ulterior motive, and even if they seem kind, sometimes…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Honey.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui&#8217;s father stopped speaking when her mother, who had been silent up until now, spoke.</p>



<p>Yui had a sulky look on her face, and she was looking grumpier than ever.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuuma is my best friend.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yui? Ah, no. By no means did I ever mean to speak ill about Yui&#8217;s friends, okay? Dad was just worried about Yui…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuuma would never do anything bad to me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui abruptly turned away with her cheeks puffed out.</p>



<p>Her father, who had never seen such a reaction before, suffered tremendous damage. He already felt devastated.</p>



<p>&#8220;Thank you for the food. I&#8217;m going to take a bath.&#8221;</p>



<p>While still in a sulky mood, Yui put the dishes away.</p>



<p>†</p>



<p>&#8220;Huff.&#8221;</p>



<p>Soaking in the bath, Yui looked up at the ceiling and exhaled pleasantly.</p>



<p>She liked baths. It was supreme bliss for her to soak around aimlessly in the bath, playing around with her smartphone (completely waterproof) and thinking about fun things.</p>



<p>However, she was feeling a little uneasy.</p>



<p>As far as it goes, she understood in her head why her dad was worried.</p>



<p>But more than that, Yuuma was her best friend, her special someone…and having her special someone badmouthed by someone, especially by her father, made her act cold towards him. She&#8217;ll have to apologize to him afterwards, she thought.</p>



<p>&#8220;…………&#8221;</p>



<p>Looking back on the days she&#8217;s spent with Yuuma so far.</p>



<p>She made friends with him through the game, and ever since she first met him, they would play together every day, and he&#8217;s treated her kindly…</p>



<p>Until now, she was never aware of love or anything like that. She enjoyed her days so much with Yuuma that she didn&#8217;t even have time to think about it.</p>



<p>But when her father said it like that, as one would expect, it made her think a little.</p>



<p>(Maybe Yuuma…really likes….me…..?)</p>



<p>Yuuma was always very kind to her. As far as it goes, they were boy and girl, and he frequently told her she was cute, so it wasn&#8217;t impossible.</p>



<p>If that&#8217;s the case, how would she feel?</p>



<p>──As for Yuuma directing such feelings at her, she didn&#8217;t really hate it.<br>But….</p>



<p>Yui also liked Yuuma. She loved him greatly. She wanted to be with him even more and get to know him better.</p>



<p>However, Yui liked him as a best friend.</p>



<p>Or rather, she didn&#8217;t even know what love was since she never had a first love in the first place.</p>



<p>They say that when you fall in love, you&#8217;re heart pounds, and it&#8217;s painful to be together with the person you love.</p>



<p>However, when she stayed with Yuuma, she felt relieved.</p>



<p>Being close to him gave her peace of mind, and it felt good having her head stroked by him. She wanted to be pampered and doted on a lot.</p>



<p>(If Yuuma was a girl, I would have felt comfortable staying close and sleeping together without reservation….)</p>



<p>She immersed her face half in water while giving off bubbles as she thought about such things.</p>



<p>But in reality, she was a girl, and Yuuma was a boy.</p>



<p>They were men and women, so it was possible that they would feel such feelings towards one another.</p>



<p>But….if that&#8217;s the case…..</p>



<p>(If Yuuma liked me…would he be happier if I went out with him…..?)</p>



<p>Suddenly, she thought of that.</p>
