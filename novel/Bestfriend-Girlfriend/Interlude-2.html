<h3>Interlude II – Me and Kanachamu</h3>


<p>After saying goodbye to Yoda at the McDonald’s in Omiya, I took the Keihin-Tōhoku Line and headed to Yono-Honcho Station.</p>
<p>Once I got off at the station, I walked for about five minutes and arrived home.</p>

<p>“I’m back—”</p>
<p>“Welcome back—”</p>

<p>After exchanging the greetings with my mom, I washed my hands and face and then retreated to my room.</p>
<p>Wearing comfortable clothes that I could relax in, I laid down on my bed and started playing with my smartphone.</p>
<p>I opened Instagram and sent a message to my best friend. By the way, the message went something like this,</p>

<p>『I got weirdly flustered when Yoda said something super negative, even though it was about himself. 』『What kind of emotion is this??』</p>
<p>“Hmm, I don’t understand…”</p>

<p>It was full of things I just couldn’t understand.</p>
<p>Seriously, I still don’t get what Yoda was trying to say… I thought about it a lot on the train ride home, but what on earth is this inferiority complex he’s carrying?</p>
<p>Like, is not being able to accept himself really the reason he can’t make friends?</p>
<p>Shouldn’t that have nothing to do with becoming friends?</p>
<p>I just don’t get it.</p>

<p>And above all, what I don’t understand the most are my own feelings.</p>
<p>Why did I end up hugging him, someone who’s so troublesome and makes things difficult just by being around…?</p>
<p>While I was lost in these thoughts, I received a reply from my best friend Kanachamu.</p>

<p>『Your message is way too abstract, I don’t get it.』</p>
<p>『Explain it better.』</p>

<p>She said—so I tried to explain today’s events in as much detail as possible to Kanachamu.</p>
<p>In response, she sent me this message,</p>

<p>『From what you’re saying, aren’t both you and Yoda overthinking things?』</p>
<p>『Huh?』</p>
<p>『Yoda might be overthinking, but am I really overthinking?』</p>
<p>『Yeah.』『Miona is also definitely overthinking things.』 『You’re oddly clever, aren’t you?』 『Maybe clever people are actually idiot.』 『Hey, you’re an idiot wwWWW!』</p>
<p>『Shut up.』 『I got a math score of eight, so you don’t deserve to mock me!』</p>
<p>『Why are we talking about math scores now?』 『Are you bragging? I’ll slash your face with the nails I got done today later!』</p>

<p>After such messages, I received a photo of nails from Kanachamu.</p>
<p>…Wow, they’re so cute! Kanachamu seriously has great nail sense! Amazing!</p>

<p>『Your nails look amazing!』 『Where did you get them?』</p>
<p>『I went to Ginza for them.』</p>
<p>『Zagin is crazy』 『Did you get sushi in Zagin?』</p>
<p>『Sushi is just ordinary there』</p>
<p>(TN:Za-gin, Gin-za.)</p>

<p>Although I was supposed to be talking about Yoda to Kanachamu, in the midst of such digressions, I engaged in a fun message exchange with my best friend.</p>
<p>…To be honest, even if I couldn’t put a name to this feeling, I thought it would be okay as long as I understood that it felt comfortable, but Kanachamu is smart.</p>
<p>In the middle of our conversation, she suddenly said something that hit the nail on the head.</p>

<p>『About that, Miona.』 『When Yoda showed you his vulnerable side, you got flustered?』 『The reason you wanted to hug Yoda…』 『Ah, that’s it!』 『Well, you know, like when a dog shows its belly, it’s cute, right?』 『I’m a genius.』</p>
<p>『You think so?』 『Showing his vulnerable side to increase my fondness…』 『Maybe Yoda is a schemer…?』</p>
<p>『No way.』 『If that were a scheme, Miona would see through it, right?』 『Isn’t Yoda just a boring otaku?』</p>
<p>『Ah?』 『Yoda is not just a boring otaku, okay?』</p>
<p>『Don’t get mad just because I’m speaking my true feelings.』 『At least I’m not completely wrong, right?』</p>

<p>After receiving that message from Kanachamu, I blinked and thought to myself, ‘…Maybe.’</p>
<p>…Because, the things Yoda said at McDonald’s today were not cool at all.</p>
<p>Despite that, I found myself wanting to hug him at that moment.</p>
<p>And in the next instant of thinking so, I was already hugging him.</p>

<p>Surely, I think Ryosuke Yoda is a sensitive guy.</p>
<p>Delicate and sensitive. Thoughtful and timid.</p>
<p>A guy who has and can voice his own ideas but struggles to have confidence.</p>
<p>In that moment when he revealed his true self without hiding anything, I felt… an inexplicable endearing feeling.</p>
<p>It’s not love. Still not love. It was just that he was irresistibly adorable, and I felt the desire to hold him tightly in my arms.</p>

<p>“He’s so cute, I… I want to make him mine…”</p>
<p>——Then I would be Yoda’s too.</p>

<p>After thinking like that, I wondered how it was different from being in love. Isn’t this just simple possessiveness?</p>
<p>But now, I really don’t want Yoda to be taken by someone else.</p>

<p>Even though we’re only friends right now, and I’m actually fine with that…</p>
<p>Could it be that I’m the possessive type?</p>
<p>Like, I can’t stand the thought of Yoda being with another girl who isn’t me?</p>
<p>Seriously, that’s bad. I don’t want Yoda to find out about this and dislike me.</p>

<p>While contemplating such matters, I recalled the moment when I hugged Yoda.</p>
<p>It’s a bit surprising that despite my efforts, my relationship with Yoda hasn’t progressed at all, but even so, I couldn’t help but think, ‘Isn’t that okay?’ Because I just want to be with him like this.</p>
<p>It’s not about wanting to have sex. It’s not even about wanting to kiss.</p>
<p>…Well, I must admit, I’m starting to want those things a little bit.</p>
<p>But that’s not what I really want.</p>
<p>Even if people say gals and otakus can’t be friends, that’s fine.</p>

<p>However, if there’s just one thing I want—I want him to stay with me, just like it’s a natural thing to do so…</p>

<p>“Is…isn’t that kind of gross!?”</p>

<p>While poking fun at my own thoughts, I opened up LINE.</p>
<p>Then, upon finding a certain boy’s name, I opened the chat screen and sent him this message.</p>

<p>『I’ve come to a conclusion!』</p>
<p>『My desire to hug Yoda was real.』</p>
<p>『But don’t get too carried away!』</p>
<p>『It’s not like I actually love Yoda or anything.』</p>

<p>Even though I said that, I’m actually starting to love him.</p>
<p>I hope you can understand the complexity of a young girl’s heart!</p>
