<h3>Interlude II</h3>


<p>“Arisaka-san, what’s the deal with Sayu-chan’s message? Something about Kanzaki-sensei’s arranged marriage and Kisumi-kun being kidnapped by your sister?” Asaki-chan fired off rapidly as we rushed to the courtyard where Yoryor and Sayu-chan were waiting.</p>



<p>“That’s pretty much it. Beyond that, I’m just as clueless.” Yoryor replied, perching on a bench with an edge in her voice.</p>



<p>“Thanks for coming here, Asa-senpai!” Sayu-chan, who had been accompanying the prickly Yoryor, clung to Asaki-chan, “Yor-senpai’s sister is seriously scary. She’s unbelievably beautiful, incredibly perceptive, and utterly inscrutable. Yor-senpai’s been in a daze since earlier.”</p>



<p>“There, there. You did your best, Sayu-chan,” Asaki-chan comforted while patting the younger girl’s back.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-chan’s sister must be gorgeous too. Wonder if I’ll get to see her if I wait,” Nanamu remained unfazed by the tense atmosphere.</p>



<p>I sat down next to Yoryor, who wore a face mixed with frustration and confusion. She couldn’t unleash her anger outright, yet she couldn’t help feeling uncomfortable. There seemed to be a complex situation at play.</p>



<p>“Yoryor, are you okay? Is there anything I can do?” </p>



<p>“No, there’s nothing we can do for now except wait for my sister and Kisumi,” she replied, her mind elsewhere as she stared at the ground, her long lashes casting shadows.</p>



<p>Despite the shade, the heat was still intense. Spending too much time out here could lead to heatstroke.</p>



<p>“Hey, want to head to the cafeteria? It’s cooler there, and you can get something cold to drink. If we let Sumisumi know, he’ll come too.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, maybe that’s best,” Yoryor replied, her response subdued.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-san, could you start from the beginning and explain everything clearly? I didn’t catch any of it. Kanzaki-sensei’s arranged marriage is a big deal for the class.”</p>



<p>“I’ve told you! I don’t know anything either!” Yoryor snapped back emotionally.</p>



<p>“Don’t take your anger out on me. You’re acting like a child just because your sister took Kisumi-kun away,” Asaki-chan retorted sharply.</p>



<p>“Asa-senpai is gearing up for battle…” Sayu-chan quickly distanced herself from Asaki-chan.</p>



<p>Both Nanamu and I felt the tension rise.</p>



<p>“Is it the class rep’s job to butt into everything?” Yoryor shot a sharp glance.</p>



<p>“If you need help, I’m here.”</p>



<p>“But I won’t be asking you.”</p>



<p>Asaki-chan’s expression changed. “Who’s the one feeling down because she’s been abandoned by reliable Kisumi-kun?”</p>



<p>Yoryor stood up fiercely. “I’ve been meaning to say this for a while, but Hasekura-san, you use ‘being class rep’ as an excuse to meddle too much in Kisumi’s affairs.”</p>



<p>“You’re the one who’s too clingy. Being too needy might push him away, you know?” </p>



<p>“Speak for yourself. Kisumi loves me just the way I am.”</p>



<p>Both of them exchanged their true feelings without holding back.</p>



<p>“Wow, they’re really going at it. Hasekura-chan, you’re unusually aggressive today.”</p>



<p>“Yor-senpai, you’re seriously whipped for Ki-senpai.”</p>



<p>Nanamu and Sayu-chan seemed to be expecting things to heat up as YorYor and Asaki-chan exchanged sharp words like dodgeball.</p>



<p>“Guys, fighting won’t solve anything!” I intervened, stepping in to mediate, “Yoryor, calm down for a moment. Asaki-chan, refrain from provoking further. This is a big deal for the class right now. We’ve gathered here as the Sena Club members, so let’s share the details thoroughly! Right? Right!”</p>



<p>The dynamics within the Sena Club were complex. Apart from Yoryor, who was the girlfriend, Asaki-chan, Sayu-chan, and I had all confessed to a boy named Kisumi Sena. Each of our attitudes was different, so it wasn’t easy to generalize. But I knew that Asaki-chan was the only one currently harboring romantic feelings for him.</p>



<p>“Yoryor, I want you to tell us exactly what happened with your sister,” I requested, and Yoryor recounted the event.</p>



<p>After hearing the explanation, we were surprised to learn that her sister was an incredibly eccentric beauty, and what’s more, she had known Sumisumi since middle school.</p>



<p>“Why do beautiful women seem to be attracted to Sena?”</p>



<p>“It’s normal to feel a bit miffed when your sister meets him earlier than you.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Even if it’s your own sister, you must be upset that she just whisked him away.”</p>



<p>Nanamu, Sayu-chan, and Asaki-chan expressed their thoughts.</p>



<p>I gently probed Yoryor, who was being vague. “What’s the main reason you’re angry? Is it because your sister took your boyfriend with you? Or is there another reason?” </p>



<p>“It’s… my sister.”</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>It was a somewhat unexpected answer. I had assumed she was angry because Sumisumi had prioritized someone else over her.</p>



<p>“I was there too, but my sister only took Kisumi with her.”</p>



<p>“So… you’re lonely being left behind.”</p>



<p>“That’s not it,” Yoryor insisted, getting defensive.</p>



<p>I messaged Sumisumi and then we all moved to the cafeteria together.</p>
