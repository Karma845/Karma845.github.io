<h3>Interlude II</h3>


<p>“I’ll go to the restroom for a moment,” Yukinami-san said, darting out of the room.</p>



<p>“I might have said something too strong. Oh, and order another round of drinks in case. I’ll go check on her,” Asaki-chan promptly followed suit and headed into the hallway.</p>



<p>“I wonder what’s up with Yukinami-san.”</p>



<p>“Is Yukinami-chan at that age where you worry about things?”</p>



<p>“Sayu gave me quite a stare.” My comment prompted Nanamu and Sumisumi to share their thoughts.</p>



<p>“Although Yukinami-chan seems carefree, isn’t she unexpectedly pure-hearted?”</p>



<p>“It looks like something touched her heartstrings. Sumisumi also looks pretty surprised.” When I voiced my thoughts, Sumisumi, who had a bewildered expression, quickly apologized.</p>



<p>“Sorry if she made the atmosphere awkward. She’s not usually like that. I was honestly surprised too.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry about it. It’s not a big deal.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, Sumisumi, don’t feel obligated just because you’re in charge or her senpai.”</p>



<p>“But she’s technically my junior. Since it’s a rare opportunity to hang out like this, I hope Sayu and everyone can get along well,” Sumisumi said, sounding almost apologetic.</p>



<p>He seemed genuinely troubled about it. I could see why Kanzaki-sensei had made him the class representative; his sense of duty was commendable.</p>



<p>“Hmm, is it always like this with seniors and juniors in clubs? Wasn’t that just a middle school story? Isn’t it odd to stick to it forever?”</p>



<p>“Miyauchi, there’s nothing we can do. Collective responsibility is a bad habit of the sports clubs.”</p>



<p>“But Nanamu, you seem to do as you please.”</p>



<p>“Hahaha, it’s a privilege reserved for the ace carrying the team on his back.”</p>



<p>“Then how about letting Sumisumi rejoin the basketball team? Give him that privilege.” When I said this sarcastically, Nanamu shrunk his tall body.</p>



<p>“Miyauchi, give me a break there.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, Miyachi, I have no intention of going back at this point.”</p>



<p>“The sense of solidarity among boys is unfair, isn’t it? Don’t you think so, Yoryor?” I sought agreement from Yoryor, but she remained silent. Instead of responding, she seemed lost in thought.</p>



<p>“Yoryor, what’s wrong?”</p>



<p>“I was reflecting on Sayu-chan’s words earlier. Then I realized it’s impossible for me.”</p>



<p>“Impossible? What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“The part about ‘<em>turning failed romances into happy memories’</em>.” Yoryor responded with a mysterious expression.</p>



<p>“Yorka, that means not dwelling on failed love and using it as a lesson next time.”</p>



<p>“I know, but that would mean the current relationship I’m in would end and become a thing of the past. I absolutely don’t want that. It’s impossible for me!”</p>



<p>She paused and looked at her boyfriend, “I want to be with Kisumi forever. A future together is what I desire.”</p>



<p>He stared at her in astonishment.</p>



<p>“Alright, this is my wish. Don’t stare at me like that.”</p>



<p>“I’ll never forget this day!”</p>



<p>“You’re being dramatic.”</p>



<p>“I was genuinely moved. I want to etch it into my heart. I don’t want to forget!” Sumisumi, in his ecstatic dance, tried to close the distance with Yoryor.</p>



<p>“This isn’t the art prep room, idiot!” she pushed him away.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-chan is so pure, it’s blinding.”</p>



<p>“Yoryor, I’m getting embarrassed here.”</p>



<p>Unexpectedly, we were exposed to the overly innocent affection between Sena Kisumi and Arisaka Yorka.</p>



<p>Nanamu and I made eye contact and contemplated if we should leave the room for a moment.</p>
