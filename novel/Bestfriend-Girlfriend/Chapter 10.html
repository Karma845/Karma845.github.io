<h2>Chapter 10: Youth Is Close and Painful</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>I just noticed a message right after finishing the last homeroom of the day.</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Yukinami-san and I are in the courtyard. You should join us after homeroom.</em></p>



<p>“…Huh?”</p>



<p>I couldn’t immediately grasp the message’s meaning and froze in confusion. <em>Yorka is at school? And she’s with Sayu? Wait, wasn’t she abroad?</em></p>



<p>“Why?” I grabbed my bag and dashed into the hallway, my eyes staring out the window facing the courtyard.</p>



<p>“Why is she here?” I hurried towards the courtyard, taking the stairs two at a time. I reached the first floor, crossed the corridor connecting the buildings, and stepped into the courtyard still wearing my indoor shoes. I sprinted with all my strength to the bench where the two of them sat.</p>



<p>“Took you long enough.” The moment Yorka saw my face, her expression turned sour.</p>



<p>“Your flight was delayed, right? I thought you’d skip school for sure.”</p>



<p>“That was the plan,” Yorka glared at me with a sullen expression.</p>



<p>“Then why? You must be tired from the long flight. Looks like you’re sleep-deprived too.”</p>



<p>Just by looking at Yorka’s face, I could tell she was more listless than usual.</p>



<p>“You notice those things right away…” she mumbled.</p>



<p>“Yorka?”</p>



<p>“You easily notice things like that but you ignored my messages yesterday. I was worried!”</p>



<p>“…Oh.”</p>



<p>It was never a good idea to ignore messages. I was so exhausted from what happened on the rooftop that I just opened her LINE and completely forgot to reply.</p>



<p>This whole mess with Sayu stemmed from me forgetting to respond. I’d have to be more mindful in the future. It was too careless to make the same mistake right after deciding to be more attentive.</p>



<p>“My bad, Yorka. I—”</p>



<p>“I know you were shocked. That’s why you should talk to her first, right?” Yorka gestured towards Sayu, who had been silent the entire time.</p>



<p>Right. Arisaka Yorka was that kind of girl. Even when I didn’t respond to the breakup message, she eventually came to talk to me.</p>



<p>This time was no different. When I was in a bind, she was always there for me. She sensed something was wrong because of my lack of response. Although she just returned, she rushed here out of concern.</p>



<p>“Thanks… Wha-!?” I suddenly noticed a red puddle at my feet. I tensed up.</p>



<p>“It’s just spilled tomato juice. I didn’t do anything! There’s no fights!”</p>



<p>“I’m not doubting you or anything.”</p>



<p>“Well, anyway, it seems like coming here today was the right call.” Yorka seemed to understand the situation and didn’t say anything more. She just believed in me, silently watching as if urging me to handle it well.</p>



<p>I stood in front of the motionless Sayu. “Sayu.”</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai,” Sayu, who was still stiff, glanced at me briefly and then quickly looked down, “Please don’t look straight at my face. I cried too much earlier, and my makeup is a mess now.”</p>



<p>“The pain I caused you is undoubtedly my responsibility. If I had attended last year’s retirement match, things wouldn’t have dragged on like this. So let me apologize sincerely once more. I’m sorry.” I lowered my head.</p>



<p>“S-Stop it. I’ve already caused trouble for both of you. If you apologize again, I won’t know what to do.”</p>



<p>“Even so, Sayu, I have a request for you.”</p>



<p>“A request…?” Sayu awaited my words anxiously.</p>



<p>“I want to reconcile. I want us to return to a relationship where we can talk freely again.”</p>



<p>“───!!!”</p>



<p>“I don’t want to forget you. I don’t want to hate you; I want us to continue as senpai and kouhai.”</p>



<p>“Will you really forgive someone like me?”</p>



<p>“That rumor made me brace myself. Thanks to that, my bond with Yorka became stronger.”</p>



<p>It was a strange twist of fate that Sayu, in her peculiar way, unintentionally pushed me forward.</p>



<p>“But that doesn’t mean you should be overly positive about it. What’s with that? It’s creepy.” Sayu recoiled toward the edge of the bench and shivered.</p>



<p>“This is solely my one-sided wish. I won’t force you, Sayu. If you don’t like it, I’ll really give up.”</p>



<p>“Ugh! Don’t test me like that!”</p>



<p>Despite trying to create distance by leaning on the bench’s armrest, Sayu didn’t attempt to escape this situation.</p>



<p>“You’re free to decide as you please. I know I’m saying absurd things.”</p>



<p>“I mean, your convenience doesn’t matter at all! Right now, the issue is, um, it’s more about me being the problem…” Sayu paused, wearing a complicated expression. She seemed unsure of how to proceed.</p>



<p>“If you can’t forgive yourself, I’ll be the one to impose punishment.”</p>



<p>“Yorka…”</p>



<p>“You seduced my boyfriend. It’s only fair to face consequences.”</p>



<p>Yorka’s eyes told me to stay silent.</p>



<p>“Alright. Go ahead, Yor-senpai.”</p>



<p>“This is going to be tough. You might be really in pain and avoiding it might be easier. But after you listen, Sayu-chan, you have to follow through.”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>“──Reconcile with Kisumi. That’s your punishment.” Yorka nonchalantly presented the same demand as mine.</p>



<p>“You two are way too soft on me, seriously!”</p>



<p>“Oh, really? What do you think, Kisumi? I, for one, won’t allow anything less.”</p>



<p>“No, this is actually a very hard punishment,” I played along exaggeratedly.</p>



<p>“Whoa, you two are more alike than I thought,” Sayu glanced between me and Yorka, her trembling lips desperately trying to maintain composure, “Then I’ll still rely on you senpais without holding back.”</p>



<p>“Do as you wish. I’m used to pampering an un-cute kouhai.”</p>



<p>“Pfft!” Sayu reluctantly, but eventually, smiled.</p>



<p>“I want to remain your senpai. Even if you’re a liar, you’ll always be my cute kouhai.”</p>



<p>“That’s unfair. Even after all of this, my connection with Ki-senpai doesn’t break. And now, there’s no way I can escape with Yor-senpai involved.” Sayu reluctantly accepted our far-fetched hope. Then, as if deciding there was nothing more to say, she stood up energetically.</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai, can I ask one last question?”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“If I had confessed last summer, would you have said yes?” She stared at me with reddened eyes.</p>



<p>“I already had feelings for Yorka back then. So, my answer wouldn’t have changed.”</p>



<p>“Geez, both of you are too whipped with each other!” Sayu stopped crying.</p>



<p>“Alright, let’s go! See you, Sayu-chan!” Yorka, seeming embarrassed by my words, hastily tried to leave.</p>



<p>“Huh? Yorka, slow down. Sayu, see you again!”</p>



<p>“Yes, see you tomorrow, Senpai.” Sayu watched us for a moment, looking a bit lonely. Then Yorka, almost like to hide her embarrassment, took my arm and led me into the school building.</p>



<p>“Where are we going?”</p>



<p>“The art preparation room. I need a thorough explanation for that ‘read-and-ignore message’ thing.”</p>



<p>“Huh, didn’t you forgive me for that?”</p>



<p>“Nope. Gotta take measures to prevent a repeat.”</p>



<p>“Cut me some slack, will you?”</p>



<p>“Is making your girlfriend anxious a hobby of yours?”</p>



<p>The students passing by looked at us in surprise. When you were this close, even an ordinary couple would catch people’s eyes. “Is it okay to be seen like this?”</p>



<p>“This way I feel more at ease. It’s been a while since we saw each other.” Yorka clung to my arm, hiding her blushing face.</p>



<p>“Welcome back, Yorka. I missed you.”</p>



<p>“I’m back. I missed you too, Kisumi.”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>After the two figures disappeared from view, Hasekura Asaki and Miyauchi Hinaka hurried over.</p>



<p>“What’s this, a pool of bright red…?”</p>



<p>“Did it really rain blood? Should we head to nurse’s office? Can you walk?”</p>



<p>Asaki and Hinaka were overly flustered, which amused Sayu.</p>



<p>“It’s just tomato juice, I’m perfectly fine. …Wait, were you watching?”</p>



<p>“We noticed a commotion near the courtyard, so we checked and there were three of you.”</p>



<p>“Sumisumi also rushed out of the classroom in a panic before that.”</p>



<p>Asaki and Hinaka exchanged awkward glances.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry for worrying you. I got rejected cleanly and now I’m officially part of the rejected club!” Sayu reported her unrequited love cheerfully.</p>



<p>“Why are you so happy?”</p>



<p>“Is that something you can say cheerfully?”</p>



<p>Sayu’s carefree attitude left the two at a loss for words. “I confessed and got forgiveness from Ki-senpai and Yor-senpai. On top of that, I found what I truly wanted was for him not to forget me.”</p>



<p>Her love for Sena Kisumi was too close. But with different grades, club retirements, exams, and graduations, the distance between them grew at various points. That was a common, unremarkable occurrence.</p>



<p>The pleasant days drifted away, and the loneliness of being alone mixed with the concealed love, intensifying the desire even more than before.</p>



<p>On the day she gathered courage to confess, he didn’t show up. They were obviously so close before. The fear that she had been forgotten crept in. She chased him desperately, and when she finally caught up, there was a woman other than herself beside him.</p>



<p>And after a reckless confession, the couple wished for Yukinami Sayu to be nearby.</p>



<p>“I’m glad if you’ve sorted out your feelings,” Asaki sighed in relief.</p>



<p>“It seems like you’ve grown up a bit,” Hinaka patted Sayu’s back lightly in comfort.</p>



<p>“Thank you, both of you.”</p>



<p>A sudden silence settled in.</p>



<p>“Alright, how about the three of us in the rejected club go somewhere to relax?” Hinaka proposed in a bright tone.</p>



<p>“Isn’t that name too negative, Hinaka-chan? And it’s a rejected club within the Sena club.” Asaki, with a wry smile, gently opposed.</p>



<p>“I don’t mind. But… Asa-senpai doesn’t count.”</p>



<p>“Ehh? Why are you leaving me out?”</p>



<p>In response to Asaki’s joking reaction, Sayu replied with a serious expression, “Because next is Asa-senpai’s turn.”</p>



<p>“Me?”</p>



<p>“You still like Ki-senpai, don’t you?”</p>



<p>Questioned by Sayu, Asaki couldn’t deny it immediately.</p>



<p>“Wait, wait! That’s not allowed. You can’t disrupt Sumisumi and Yoryor!” Hinaka immediately intervened, “Yukinami-san, please don’t stir up Asaki-chan unnecessarily.”</p>



<p>“It’s impossible, Miyauchi-senpai. Asa-senpai hasn’t fully given up in her heart. I know because I’ve been there.”</p>



<p>“A heartbroken junior is going crazy!”</p>



<p>“I’m calm now. It’s because I’m calm that I think so.”</p>



<p>While Hinaka tried to change the topic, somewhere in her heart, she found herself agreeing with Sayu.</p>



<p>After facing Sayu’s direct gaze, Asaki who had been silent finally spoke up;</p>



<p>“Yeah, maybe. Sorry, Hinaka-chan. I’ll refrain from the ‘rejected club’ for now.”</p>



<p>Upon Sayu’s words, Asaki decided to confront her own muddled feelings once again.</p>



<p>Hasekura Asaki’s love was not yet over.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>Being together in the art preparation room felt incredibly nostalgic. Despite it had only been a week for Golden Week, I looked at the familiar room with an oddly fresh mood.</p>



<p>“Ah, I’m thirsty. How about you make some tea, Kisumi? Green tea would be good today,” Yorka said, taking her usual seat.</p>



<p>Normally it was either coffee or black tea, but after being abroad for so long, it seemed she had been craving green tea.</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>While waiting for the electric kettle to boil, I grabbed soy-flavored rice crackers from the stash.</p>



<p>“When did you arrive in Japan?”</p>



<p>“Around noon today. The wind was so strong when we departed and the plane went up and down like a roller coaster. I kept holding on to my seat the whole time.”</p>



<p>“That must have been tough.”</p>



<p>“I couldn’t sleep much on the plane either, and now my whole body is sore.”</p>



<p>“Should I give you a shoulder massage after you have a drink?”</p>



<p>“Sounds good. Thanks.”</p>



<p>I brewed tea and placed a cup and rice crackers in front of Yorka. Now, it was officialy snack time.</p>



<p>“Oh, Kisumi, you’re drinking black coffee, huh? We’re not having the same drink.”</p>



<p>I was sipping my usual black coffee.</p>



<p>“I had a delicious green tea during lunch.”</p>



<p>“…Where did you have it?”</p>



<p>“Err, I had something to discuss with Kanzaki-sensei, so I tasted it in the tea room…”</p>



<p>My throat froze midway through my answer. Kanzaki-sensei was Yorka’s arch-nemesis. As expected, Yorka pouted. Perhaps due to lack of sleep, her usual intimidating gaze seemed even more ominous.</p>



<p>“You went to that teacher again! Why?!”</p>



<p>“There was something I needed to confirm directly with her.”</p>



<p>“Which means you two were alone! Right?” Yorka pressed on, her jealousy radar alarmingly sensitive.</p>



<p>“Why are you so sharp?”</p>



<p>“I’m too careless. I should have come sooner.”</p>



<p>“You were still at the airport at that time.”</p>



<p>“Mmm, I should’ve chartered a jet.”</p>



<p>“Does the Arisaka family have that much money!?”</p>



<p>“I hate bad weather.”</p>



<p>I couldn’t tell if she was joking or serious.</p>



<p>“Why are you so hostile towards Kanzaki-sensei anyway?”</p>



<p>“That teacher is no good! What’s not good is just—not good!”</p>



<p>“You can even forgive Sayu, I really don’t get it…”</p>



<p>Unable to fathom the reason behind Yorka’s burning antagonism, I inquired. She generally showed no interest in others, so there must be a compelling reason for her to harbor such animosity.</p>



<p>Even during karaoke, she instantly decided to participate upon hearing Asaki-san was coming. She was a girl with very extreme likes and dislikes.</p>



<p>Last year, Yorka and I spent the entire year in Kanzaki-sensei’s class. Regardless of whether there was trouble between Yorka and Kanzaki-sensei or not, I didn’t recall ever seeing these two talking.</p>



<p><em>Could there be some pre-existing history between the two before entering school?</em></p>



<p>“Yorka, did something happen between you and Sensei in the past?”</p>



<p>“Not me.”</p>



<p>“Then, your sister?” I quickly caught on to the answer. Yorka confirmed it with silence.</p>



<p>“This is a good opportunity. Can you tell me? As the class rep, I’ll have to talk to the teacher no matter what.”</p>



<p>“My sister changed after entering Eisei because of that teacher.”</p>



<p>“Siscon, huh?” I thought it was a serious matter, but it turned out she just really loved her sister.</p>



<p>“It’s not like that!”</p>



<p>“But you don’t hate your sister who changed because of that teacher, right?”</p>



<p>Even during the rumored incident, her sister collaborated with Kanzaki-sensei to help Yorka.</p>



<p>“Yeah, but…”</p>



<p>“Haha, did the shock come because your beloved sister changing so much? Is that why you see Kanzaki-sensei as an enemy?”</p>



<p>“Why do you interpret it that way?”</p>



<p>Yorka stubbornly denied. Her refusal suggesting the symptoms were serious.</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei was the sworn enemy who changed her dear sister drastically. It was understandable she would be unhappy having to spend her high school life as that teacher’s student.</p>



<p>“I think she’s a good teacher. You don’t need to be so wary.”</p>



<p>Even today, without Kanzaki-sensei’s advice, I didn’t think I could have honestly reconciled with Sayu.</p>



<p>“Are you siding with her too?” Yorka got angry.</p>



<p>“We’re neither enemies nor allies in the first place.”</p>



<p>“In any case, you shouldn’t be influenced by that teacher.” With that, Yorka ended the topic.</p>



<p>Three years was ample time for a teenager to grow. It might just be a coincidence that Kanzaki-sensei became the catalyst for her sister’s transformation. If what Yorka said was true, there’s no way her sister would maintain contact with Kanzaki-sensei after graduation. Her sister changed not by coercion but by her own will. That’s how I saw it.</p>



<p>I waited until my girlfriend’s mood improve before pulling a stool in front of the chair. Yorka sat on the stool and I began massaging her shoulders from behind.</p>



<p>I gently placed my hands on her delicate shoulders. They were indeed tense.</p>



<p>“Mmhh—”</p>



<p>As I started massaging, Yorka let out a moan-like sound.</p>



<p>“Is it okay?”</p>



<p>“It hurts, but it feels good… and ticklish.”</p>



<p>“You’re quite stiff here.”</p>



<p>“But Kisumi, you’re good at this.” Yorka squirmed and wriggled while managing to endure the inexplicable stimulation.</p>



<p>“Next, your back,” I said, moving my fingers from her shoulders to her back.</p>



<p>“Ahh, uuu—”</p>



<p>“It’s pretty tight here too.” I worked on loosening her muscles fom neck to back, and further down to her waist.</p>



<p>“Okay, next—”</p>



<p>“Enough! I feel relaxed now!”</p>



<p>“Alright, stay still,” I gently pushed Yorka back when she tried to turn around.</p>



<p>“That’s enough, really. Tha—” </p>



<p>I embraced Yorka tightly from behind.</p>



<p>“Huh!? Uh, what──”</p>



<p>I pressed my nose against her nape.</p>



<p>“K-Kisumi…?”</p>



<p>“…I should be the one thanking you.” I held Yorka close without letting go. Though she initially resisted, she quickly relaxed and surrendered herself to me.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1000010054.png" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>“It’s rare for you to hug me. Is it a reward for something?”</p>



<p>“For a boyfriend who had been waiting devotedly for his lover.”</p>



<p>“It’s only been a week.”</p>



<p>“It felt as difficult as spring break.”</p>



<p>“We already shared a hug before leaving.”</p>



<p>“That wasn’t enough.”</p>



<p>“You’re really spoiled.”</p>



<p>“What’s wrong with missing the girl I love? I’m suffering from Yorka-deficiency syndrome.”</p>



<p>“Does that mean you would die without me around?”</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t.”</p>



<p>“Alright, alright. I missed you too.” Yorka reached out and gently stroked my hair, like calming a stubborn child.</p>



<p>As we continued holding each other, basking in each other’s warmth, I soon heard the rhythmic sound of her falling into a peaceful sleep.</p>



<p>“You must’ve been holding back your sleepiness.”</p>



<p>Given the exhaustion from the long journey and the jet lag, Yorka was now comfortably asleep, showing me her peaceful face.</p>



<p>That, above all, made me happy.</p>



<p>Still holding the sleeping Yorka, I quietly observed the fading orange sunlight filtering into the art preparation room. In the dimming room, I wondered how much time had passed.</p>



<p>A subdued knock echoed.</p>



<p>After a short wait, the door swung open, revealing none other than Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>I was startled and almost moved my body. I couldn’t help but worry if I had accidentally wake up Yorka.</p>



<p>“It’s fine. Please don’t wake her up,” Kanzaki-sensei noticed Yorka sleeping and gestured for me to stay still.</p>



<p>“You figured out she’s here easily,” I lowered my voice as well.</p>



<p>“I received a message from her sister that Arisaka-san headed to school after they just arrived. I couldn’t believe it at first, but to think she was really here…” Kanzaki-sensei lightly leaned on a desk adorned with plaster statues, “Arisaka-san can now do whatever she wants, huh?”</p>



<p>There was a subtle joy in her voice, seemingly pleased with Yorka’s change. The way she spoke made it sound as if the old Yorka couldn’t act of her own free will before, and that bothered me.</p>



<p>“Uh, please don’t blame her for this.” I stepped in to support Yorka, who, despite being an honor student, had been acting somewhat provocatively toward Kanzaki-sensei.</p>



<p>“I provided this room for her. I’d be more ashamed if I give her a lecture about coming to school because she missed her boyfriend after classes are over.”</p>



<p>Even in the dimly lit room, Kanzaki-sensei squinted as if gazing at something bright.</p>



<p>“It seems you’re still close to Yorka’s sister even after she graduated.”</p>



<p>“Well, Arisaka-san’s sister and I have a teacher-student relationship, but we just happen to get along as individuals. I was a new teacher who had just arrived, and her sister was a class representative. We had plenty of chances to interact, and before I knew it, we became quite close.”</p>



<p>According to Yorka’s stories, her sister had been quite popular, even serving as the student council president since her freshman year. She was well-liked among the older teacher and current students like us benefited from that legacy.</p>



<p>For Kanzaki-sensei, Yorka’s sister was undoubtedly a memorable student.</p>



<p>“It seems Yorka’s wariness toward you is somehow linked to her sister.”</p>



<p>“How did she phrase it?”</p>



<p>“Pretty much as you’d imagine.”</p>



<p>Since Yorka’s earlier explanation was rather aggressive, I refrained from going into detail verbally.</p>



<p>“I’m the villain to her,” the teacher smiled.</p>



<p>“But the truth is different, isn’t it?” I gently touched Yorka’s slender shoulder.</p>



<p>“For Arisaka-san, her sister was always a role model. She diligently imitated her older sister from a young age and wanted to be like her.”</p>



<p>She talked about the relationship between the Arisaka sisters in the past tense. The key to this laid in our homeroom teacher, Kanzaki Shizuru.</p>



<p>“A sister lovingly imitating her older sister sounds like a cute story.”</p>



<p>“Regardless of how close siblings are, personalities and aptitudes can differ. Arisaka-san’s sister was like a bundle of energy, a bright and lively girl. She even became the student council president and modeled for the school’s pamphlet when the uniform’s style was updated.”</p>



<p>“Wait, Yorka’s sister is the legendary model?”</p>



<p>“She graduated before you and the others enrolled, it’s no wonder you didn’t know.”</p>



<p>What a surprise! The identity of the beautiful model who boosted our school’s popularity was none other than my girlfriend’s sister!</p>



<p>“Arisaka-san, though equally glamorous, is fundamentally more delicate and reserved.”</p>



<p>“They’re quite contrasting sisters.”</p>



<p>“Arisaka-san’s sister noticed her younger sibling struggling and felt uneasy to see her forcing herself. Although she wanted to support her, she didn’t know how to approach her or help her. That’s why she came to me to seek advice.”</p>



<p>Yorka was unaware of her sister’s inner heart. It must be quite a revelation for Yorka to learn that her idealized sister harbored such concerns.</p>



<p>“<em>‘If that’s the case, why don’t you try to make your sister look for a different path?’</em>“</p>



<p>“Hmm?”</p>



<p>“I advised her in that direction back then after hearing various details. It worked positively for Arisaka-san’s sister. However…”</p>



<p>“…Yorka didn’t know what to do and ended up lost.”</p>



<p>Finally, I understood why Kanzaki-sensei had been looking out for Yorka since her enrollment. The admirable sister changed after the teacher’s advice, but Yorka felt like the ladder had been pulled away and lost sight of the future self she should aspire to. Kanzaki-sensei carried the burden of responsibility for that.</p>



<p>“I’m glad that Arisaka-san has found someone who truly understand her.”</p>



<p>In the dim light, a hint of remorse colored Kanzaki-sensei’s serene profile. She had been a supportive confidant for Yorka’s sister, yet it didn’t extend to Yorka herself.</p>



<p>“─But, teachers aren’t these superhumans who can guide everyone, right? To be frank, I don’t expect that much from regular people,” I boldly shared my opinion, causing Kanzaki-sensei to widen her eyes.</p>



<p>This teacher also fell into the category of sincere dedication. Handling each student individually was already a formidable task, let alone aiding family members. What’s more, there was still a lingering concern about her early days as a new teacher.</p>



<p>Taking on too much alone was never a good thing.</p>



<p>“Rest assured, Sensei. I’m here now,” I declared with a bright voice. The girl in my arms was someone I’d always protect.</p>



<p>“…Honestly, Sena-san, you’re the most unexpected one,” she remarked before standing up from the desk, “Just to make it clear, it’s not only you who cares deeply for Arisaka-san. Her overprotective sister still consults me whenever there’s an issue. And she’s a precious student to me as well.”</p>



<p>With these words, she gracefully moved towards the door, her long black hair was swaying.</p>



<p>“Please refrain from staying up late at school. The gates will close soon.”</p>



<p>“Understood. I’ll wake her up after you go.”</p>



<p>“Good.”</p>



<p>A subtle smile appeared on the corner of Kanzaki-sensei’s lips that was so small that you could almost miss it. Once her footsteps and presence faded, I addressed Yorka.</p>



<p>“Isn’t it about time to wake up from your pretend-nap, Yoruka?”</p>



<p>“…How did you notice?” Yorka quickly sat up.</p>



<p>“Well, you were practically glued to me.”</p>



<p>Even the slightest motion would be conveyed.</p>



<p>Yorka was already awake when Kanzaki-sensei arrived. She was sensitive to the presence of others. The moment she recognized it was Kanzaki-sensei, she decided to feign sleep. Since the lights weren’t turned on, the teacher didn’t see Yorka’s subtle movements.</p>



<p>“Could you at least pretend not to notice?”</p>



<p>“Not exposing you while Sensei is around is generous enough. Anyway, what are your thoughts after hearing the truth?”</p>



<p>“When you said, ‘<em>Rest assured, Sensei. I’m here now’</em>, that means you’re on my side, right?”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that obvious?”</p>



<p>“Depending on how you interpret it, it could also mean you’re supporting that teacher! After your kouhai, is your homeroom teacher next!?”</p>



<p><em>Japanese is so difficult!</em></p>



<p>“Don’t blatantly try to change the topic.”</p>



<p>Yorka clearly attempted to divert the conversation. <em>Yeah, not happening.</em> This was an opportunity for Yorka to reevaluate her past correctly. Just Sayu and I managed to repair our relationship, I hope Yorka and Kanzaki-sensei could come to a better understanding.</p>



<p>We left the art preparation room together. Walking side by side in the dim hallway, Yorka muttered;</p>



<p>“…I can’t easily accept this.”</p>



<p>“That’s understandable.”</p>



<p>In the socially adept, high-achieving Arisaka family, Yorka, with her reserved nature, had desperately tried to catch up by imitating her older sister. But from her sister’s perspective, seeing Yorka struggle to mimic her was undoubtedly pitiable.</p>



<p>The more substantial the emotional investment, the harder it was to let go. The changes in her sister made Yorka lost her role model and unwillingly confronted herself. It was true that Yorka, without a clear understanding of what she wanted, had been grappling with confusion and suffered.</p>



<p>“It’s your freedom to think about it until you can accept it, or just forget. After all, you can’t redo the past.”</p>



<p>“Seems like you’re particularly feeling that today,” Yorka said, smiling mischievously.</p>



<p>“Well, if you could redo the past, you probably wouldn’t have enrolled in Eisei, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. I only took the entrance exam because my big sister was here. Can’t say I had any proactive reasons.”</p>



<p>“Then you and I wouldn’t have met,” I expressed these heartfelt words.</p>



<p>You couldn’t choose how you meet someone. That’s why I wanted to love Yorka enough to heal the wounds she carried. The warmth of our linked hands and the fervor of this love that burned within me weren’t illusions; they were precious, above all else.</p>



<p>“Well, it can also be interpreted that way,” Yorka said, her face bright, somehow satisfied, “That’s why I like you, Kisumi. Just talking to you makes my problems seem insignificant.”</p>



<p>“Then I’m glad.”</p>



<p>I wanted the one I love to always be smiling. I vowed to be someone who could fulfill that.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kisumi! How about grabbing dinner? I want to decide where to go for our date on the next vacation!” Yorka, now fully energized, suggested. It’s probably not just thanks to the massage and nap.</p>



<p>I had no reason to refuse such a wonderful proposal from my girlfriend.</p>
