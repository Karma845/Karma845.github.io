<h2>Chapter 10: Battle Strategy of an Ordinary Person</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>



<p>“Kisumi betrayed me.” Yorka’s expression turned grave as she uttered those words while facing the gathered members of the Sena Club.</p>



<p>After witnessing the scene with her sister at the station, Yorka and Sayu immediately gathered the other members of the Sena Club, excluding the organizer. </p>



<p>Asaki, Hinaka, and Nanamura rushed to come as they sensed an unusual atmosphere due to Yorka’s unexpected call and Kisumi’s absence.</p>



<p>They were all unsure how to react to Yorka’s weighty statement.</p>



<p>“Though Yor-senpai said before “<em>I’d be okay if I were betrayed by Kisumi</em>” it actually happened!”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to remember every word, Sayu-chan.”</p>



<p>“But I was impressed. Oh, here’s the evidence,” Sayu showed the picture she had taken earlier.</p>



<p>It depicted Kisumi’s back and Aria leaning in close. While they couldn’t see their expressions, the faces were aligned in such a way that it looked like they were kissing.</p>



<p>“Even after claiming to be devoted to Yor-senpai, he’s out kissing a woman and coming home in the morning. This time, there’s no excuse! He’s completely guilty!” Sayu accused angrily, asserting it was infidelity from the start with confidence.</p>



<p>“Yukinami-chan, you always seem to stumble upon the juiciest gossip,” Nanamura remarked. Although he was often one to revel in gossip, he was unusually calm this time.</p>



<p>“I wonder if they’re really kissing. It might just be a coincidence that they’re close together.” Hinaka expressed her doubt. Without a clear shot of lips touching, it was too early to label it as cheating.</p>



<p>“You two can defend Ki-senpai all you want, but Yor-senpai is clearly hurt by this! Right, Asa-senpai? This is completely out of line, isn’t it!?” </p>



<p>Sayu was the most indignant among them.</p>



<p>After confessing to her long-standing crush and finally finding closure, Sayu had been able to accept her unrequited love. The bond between Kisumi and Yorka was so strong that there was no room for outsiders. That’s why Sayu had been able to give up without any resentment.</p>



<p>However, witnessing a scene like this felt like betrayal right before her eyes, making her more emotional than necessary.</p>



<p>“Your sister finally showed her true colors, huh?” Asaki’s expression remained calm, but her voice betrayed her frustration.</p>



<p>“My sister’s true colors?” Yorka tilted her head, not quite catching on.</p>



<p>“Wait a second! Both Hasekura-chan and Yukinami-chan are misunderstanding something fundamental,” Nanamura interjected. “You guys are jumping to conclusions! When did Arisaka-chan even suspect Sena of cheating?” </p>



<p>“”Huh?”” </p>



<p>Asaki and Sayu’s surprised voices overlapped.</p>



<p>“But Arisaka-san herself is angry and said she was ‘betrayed’.”</p>



<p>“Exactly! And if you see Ki-senpai’s flustered reaction, it’s obvious he’s guilty.”</p>



<p>“Regardless of the circumstances, anyone would panic if they were seen holding someone who isn’t their lover or acquaintance. It’d be more suspicious if Sena was calm in such a situation. Well, I wouldn’t panic though.” Setting aside Nanamura himself, his point was valid.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-chan isn’t angry for that reason. She doesn’t suspect Sena of cheating at all, right?” </p>



<p>Knowing Sena Kisumi’s unwavering devotion to Arisaka Yorka, there was no way he would cheat.</p>



<p>“Yeah,” Yorka affirmed without hesitation.</p>



<p>In her mind, her boyfriend was simply with her sister. She hadn’t even considered the possibility of anything beyond that.</p>



<p>“But isn’t it normal to suspect him cheating with your sister if you saw that scene?” Asaki persisted, still finding it hard to believe.</p>



<p>“What got me upset was that Kisumi neglected to contact me and broke the promise not to get close to my sister.” Yorka was clearly miffed, though it leaned more towards being pouty and adorable than outright anger.</p>



<p>“Then please don’t phrase it confusingly like ‘<em>betrayed by Kisumi</em>’, that can be misleading,” Asaki recalled the raw emotions Yorka had expressed to her before, and knew it wasn’t a lie. Even without that, Asaki herself was angry upon seeing the photo.</p>



<p>“Then why did you run away from the station, Yor-senpai?” Sayu, who had been there, couldn’t grasp Yorka’s sudden action.</p>



<p>“Even though I was worried and came all the way there, Kisumi spent the whole night with my sister. It’s frustrating I’m the only one left out.”</p>



<p>“Just how much do you like your sister and Ki-senpai?!” Sayu’s expression twisted in disbelief.</p>



<p>“I’d naturally be a bit suspicious if it were any other woman. But she’s my sister,” Yorka replied without a hint of doubt.</p>



<p>Her unwavering trust left the group speechless. Being able to trust someone so completely while pushing away most others was impressive. It was proof of just how much Yorka was in love with Kisumi.</p>



<p>“Even if it’s your real sister, anything can happen between a man and a woman. Including a kiss,” Asaki threw out a mundane thought almost maliciously.</p>



<p>“────Huh?” Yorka was genuinely surprised this time.</p>



<p>“It’s fine if you respect and love your sister, but the reality might be different. No matter how talented and amazing she is, she’s still a college student. If she’s interested in someone, she’ll make a move, find excuses to meet, and create opportunities to advance the relationship. That’s just how love tactics work.”</p>



<p>“Love… tactics?”</p>



<p>“You must have some idea too, don’t you?” Asaki’s pointed question left Yorka pondering.</p>



<p>“I-I couldn’t possibly…” Her denial was feeble.</p>



<p>Several scenes of excessive physical contact between her sister and Kisumi appeared in Yorka’s mind. Looking at it objectively, her behavior towards her former student was overly familiar.</p>



<p>“We can’t say for sure how aware your sister is of her actions, but feelings can be pretty obvious to outsiders. You’d know best, wouldn’t you?” </p>



<p>“────!!” Reflecting on her own experiences, Yorka began to harbor doubts about her sister.</p>



<p>When Kisumi publicly declared their relationship in front of their classmates, Yorka thought it was all over. The uncomfortable days of being exposed to curious glances had begun. She panicked at the thought of such despair.</p>



<p>However, their classmates had long seen through her feelings. Her anxiety turned out to be unfounded, and they had peacefully accepted her status as Sena Kisumi’s girlfriend since then.</p>



<p>“Sorry, but you’re being too optimistic about your family. It’s your choice, but misjudging your sister could be dangerous,” Asaki warned, though her threat sounded more like gentle advice.</p>



<p>Yorka felt dizzy with the implications. Could her own sister become her romantic rival? Was such a reality even possible?</p>



<p>“Kisumi would never, ever kiss anyone! Not when he hasn’t even kissed me yet!” Yorka blurted out reflexively and revealed more than necessary.</p>



<p>“…You’re incredibly trusting when it comes to someone you like.”</p>



<p>“Yor-senpai, you’re so scary. You’re giving off some serious ‘main wife’ vibes,” Sayu chimed in, feeling more fearful of Yorka than angry at Kisumi.</p>



<p>“Well, if Arisaka-chan’s sister decides to use her mature charm to seduce Sena, even someone like him will—”</p>



<p>Yorka interrupted Nanamura with a piercing stare.</p>



<p>“Whoa, getting glared at by Arisaka-chan is scary,” Nanamura’s broad shoulders shook.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. Knowing Sumisumi, he probably just helped out your sister who almost fell down. I mean, it’s unlikely he’d do anything bold like that in a crowded place like the station, where anyone could be watching.” Hinaka glanced briefly at Sayu.</p>



<p>“B-But how do you explain this photo? Even without the stand-in boyfriend situation, if Yor-senpai’s sister and Ki-senpai got too close, it could lead to a real mess, don’t you think?” Sayu, who was now calmer, tried to grasp the increasingly tangled situation.</p>



<p>“We can just leave it be? I still have feelings for Kisumi-kun. As Arisaka-san’s sister said, maybe it’d be beneficial for me if this whole thing fails,” Asaki said dismissively, as if she couldn’t be bothered.</p>



<p>“Whoa, that’s a declaration of war out of nowhere! Looks like the flag for Sena isn’t broken after all.”</p>



<p>“Why is Asaki-chan so merciless?” </p>



<p>“Asa-senpai, you’re bold!” </p>



<p>The three of them looked at Yorka and waited for her reaction. Ignoring the attention on herself, Yorka immersed herself in thought.</p>



<p>Ironically, it was Hasekura Asaki’s words, the person she needed to be most wary of, that calmed Yorka down. Feeling cornered, her exceptional mind came into play.</p>



<p>She casted aside hesitations, distractions, and almost erupting emotions, and focused solely on a cold, rational analysis. She swiftly considered every possibility and deduced the best course of action for the future.</p>



<p>“Yoryor…?” Hinaka called out to the silent Yorka.</p>



<p>At this moment, Yorka had transformed into a beautiful creature of reason. She was dissecting her sister, Arisaka Aria, not as the idealized sister of her childhood dreams but as a real, flawed human.</p>



<p>And then, Yorka found her answer.</p>



<p>“I don’t mind if Hasekura-san wants to sit back and watch. But if my sister turns out to be the kind of person Hasekura-san doubts, in the end, it won’t be me or you who wins—it’ll definitely be my sister,” Yorka declared, her tone carrying a hint of a threat.</p>



<p>The members of the Sena Club, upon seeing her expression, couldn’t help but think of that sister.</p>



<p>“If the plan fails, our homeroom teacher will resign from her teaching position. What’s the benefit of staying silent, Hasekura-san?”</p>



<p><em>Even Hasekura Asaki won’t outsmart Arisaka Aria</em>—Yorka was implying as much.</p>



<p>“Then, what would you do, Arisaka-san?” Asaki was leaning in slightly.</p>



<p>“As for the homeroom teacher matter, it doesn’t concern me. Even being a stand-in boyfriend was something my sister forced onto Kisumi, and knowing his personality, he couldn’t refuse.”</p>



<p>“But what if your sister betrayed you?”</p>



<p>“I’ve always looked up to her and she’s been my goal. So, if I were compared to her, I wouldn’t have the confidence to win,” Yorka confessed honestly. </p>



<p>Her sister had always been someone she admired, and she had never once thought about winning against her.</p>



<p>“But still, it’s different when it comes to Kisumi!” Yorka said with surprising clarity, “Even if she’s my sister. I won’t hand him over to anyone.”</p>



<p>As she made this declaration, she looked directly at Asaki.</p>



<p>“Hasekura-san, I have a proposal. I can’t judge my sister properly on my own, and you can’t compete with her either. But if you’re willing to lend your strength, we can maintain the status quo. At least, I don’t think this gathering of the Sena Club is a bad thing. In fact, I find it enjoyable. That’s why I won’t complain no matter who joins.”</p>



<p>It was a concession and a promise from Yorka, Kisumi’s girlfriend. She wouldn’t reject someone even if she knew they had feelings for her boyfriend. She would accept their existence herself.</p>



<p>“If you want Kisumi to be your boyfriend, wouldn’t you have a better chance of winning against me than against my sister?” </p>



<p>“Um, Arisaka-chan…”</p>



<p>“Are you negotiating?”</p>



<p>Yorka’s suggestion startled both Nanamura and Hinaka simultaneously. The two friends who had supported Kisumi and Yorka’s romance were impressed by her remarkable growth.</p>



<p>“Are you sure, Arisaka-san?” Asaki asked with a smirk.</p>



<p>“I have to face my sister properly.”</p>



<p>If there was any romantic sentiment behind Aria’s interest in Kisumi, Yorka had to confront her ideal before regretting everything.</p>



<p>“But what are we going to do specifically from here?”</p>



<p>“For starters, shouldn’t you confirm the fact with Kisumi-kun?” </p>



<p>“By the way Yor-senpai, when you left, you said something like ‘<em>I trusted you</em>,’ which could give him the wrong idea.”</p>



<p>“I did…” Yorka’s expression turned grim.</p>



<p>“Oh boy, Sena’s probably flipping out on his bed right now,” Nanamura chuckled.</p>



<p>“W-What should I do?” </p>



<p>“I guess I’ll have to lend a hand,” Hinaka offered.</p>



<p>“What’s your plan, Miyauchi?”</p>



<p>“I’m going to enlist the help of a super powerful ally!”</p>



<p>Hinaka pulled out her phone and sent a message to the person closest to Kisumi. Soon enough, shd received a prompt reply.</p>



<p>“Well then, since we’re already here, why don’t we all go together?”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>“…My summer is over.”</p>



<p>Before the final exams were even over, everything had fallen apart. </p>



<p>Under the scorching sun, I barely made it home, feeling like a walking corpse. I tried to wash away my thoughts under the cold shower, but it was futile. I ended up sprawled on the bed wearing only my boxer. </p>



<p>Putting on clothes seemed like too much hassle. My mind was a mess, and despite the expected exhaustion, drowsiness refused to come.</p>



<p>As I was lying in the air-conditioned room, I felt like a living corpse, breathing but devoid of purpose. I had no motivation to do anything. Though this current situation was bad, I had no idea what to do.</p>



<p>I felt rushed, but my mind spun in circles like gears refusing to engage.</p>



<p>Still, my stubborn self couldn’t help but ponder in a corner of my mind, <em>“How can Yorka forgive me?”</em></p>



<p>I had forgotten to turn on my phone after last night’s tumultuous events. After falling asleep in the middle of the night and waking up in a frenzy, I had been talking to Aria-san the whole time. To make matters worse, Yorka had seen me at the worst possible moment.</p>



<p>“She went all the way here because she’s worried, and what do I do?”</p>



<p>Even berating myself wasn’t enough. With the whole situation already complicated because of the stand-in boyfriend arrangement, what good would it do to worsen things?</p>



<p>I had agreed on this for Yorka’s sake, but breaking up with her would leave me with nothing.</p>



<p>“Should I have just refused from the beginning?” I found myself voicing my doubts. </p>



<p>No matter the reason, if I ended up hurting Yorka, it wouldn’t be worth it. Even if the stand-in boyfriend scheme succeeded, I’d only make Yorka dislike Kanzaki-sensei even more.</p>



<p>“—Why am I assuming we’re breaking up?” I snapped at myself, shaking off the looming negativity.</p>



<p>Speculating beyond what had happened would only lead to more distress. What mattered was sorting out the present and clarifying my next steps.</p>



<p>“It was just a coincidence that I caught Aria-san. Yorka came to check on me out of concern. Kanzaki-sensei’s situation is all acting. And I love Yorka. It’s just a series of unfortunate coincidences!”</p>



<p>No one was at fault; the timing was just unfortunate. </p>



<p>Think. Think. Think. </p>



<p>Act before any more regrets pile up.</p>



<p>To avoid the worst outcome where everyone got hurt, I must strive for the best course of action. Even if it wasn’t perfect, I must find the best solution.</p>



<p><em>“Sena, choosing someone means not choosing someone else.”</em></p>



<p>The words Nanamura spoke to me at the ramen shop now took on new significance.</p>



<p>It wasn’t just about love; there were limits to what one could handle. Choosing meant setting clear priorities.</p>



<p>My goal was to stay with Yorka as her boyfriend, and to keep Kanzaki-sensei as our teacher until the end. It was about enjoying high school life with everyone—a lover, friends and teachers—without anyone missing until we graduate.</p>



<p>“Huh? Why am I thinking about this alone without anyone from Sena Club?”</p>



<p>I suddenly realized.</p>



<p>I had been asked to help solely because Aria-san said it was Kanzaki-sensei’s personal problem, but now I realized that everyone in the Sena Club knew about the arranged marriage incident, thanks to Sayu who spread it in the group chat.</p>



<p>Was there any reason to leave them out of this?</p>



<p>“Does Aria-san truly believe I’m enough on my own?” </p>



<p>I tried to decipher the intentions behind the questioner and reconsidered the thoughts of the person who set up the current situation. </p>



<p>While I appreciated her trust, I lacked that level of confidence in myself. Frankly, I could use the support of my friends more than ever.</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s right. That’s okay.”</p>



<p>I had always relied on someone’s help to get through tough times. </p>



<p>Just when I had my own strategy and determination in place, I suddenly heard a loud voice.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>“Kisumi-kun! You’ve got visitors!”</p>



<p>My sister, Ei, barged into my room without bothering to knock. Her energy levels were higher than usual.</p>



<p>“Visitors? Who?”</p>



<p>As I glanced towards the door, I spotted Yorka, Asaki-san, Miyachi, Sayu, and Nanamura gathered there.</p>



<p>“You guys…”</p>



<p>“Kisumi, at least put some clothes on!” Yorka shouted.</p>



<p>“—!?”</p>



<p>I realized I was only wearing boxers and hastily put on some clothes.</p>



<p>“Sena, your sister seems to have a promising future.”</p>



<p>“I’ll kill you if you talk to her.”</p>



<p>“That condition is too strict. But oh well, elementary schoolers are off-limits even for me.”</p>



<p>As Nanamura nonchalantly entered the room, the rest of the girls followed cautiously.</p>



<p>I hoped they didn’t stare too long; I hadn’t exactly cleaned up much.</p>



<p>“So, um, what’s going on exactly? Everyone’s here at my place…” I glanced around, feeling perplexed.</p>



<p>“Hinaka-chan messaged me on LINE and asked if they all could come over to see Kisumi-kun, so I said okay!” My sister answered for some reason.</p>



<p>“Ei, you should check with me first. And call me ‘onii-chan’.”</p>



<p>“But I really wanted to see Yorka-chan and Hinaka-chan!” </p>



<p>Ei’s pure desire to have fun seemed to outweigh any other considerations, as she happily gave her okay. But considering I hadn’t even noticed the doorbell rang, I wonder whether I was capable of a proper response.</p>



<p>“And when did Miyachi exchange contact info with Ei?”</p>



<p>“Sorry about that. Actually, I visited your house secretly last year,” Miyachi admitted with a sheepish grin.</p>



<p>“That’s news to me…”</p>



<p>“We’ve been messaging each other every now and then. Ei-chan types really fast!”</p>



<p>“Wait, so Miyachi was the one Ei was messaging on the day Aria-san came to school?” </p>



<p>“That’s right. I’m sorry, Sumisumi.”</p>



<p>“Ei didn’t say anything unnecessary, did she?”</p>



<p>I was concerned about Ei’s innocent responses that might give away too much.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. I could tell Ei-chan really loves you, so it’s all good.”</p>



<p>“I feel anxious…” </p>



<p>I braced myself in front of the Sena Club members that Ei had brought in.</p>



<p>“Ei, we need to talk about something important. Could you leave the room for a bit?” </p>



<p>“I don’t wanna! I want to play with everyone too. I hate being left out!” As my sister pouted, Yorka bent down to calm her down.</p>



<p>“Sorry, Ei-chan. Kisumi and I had a little argument. Can we talk so we can make up?”</p>



<p>“With Yorka-chan?” </p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>“Is it Kisumi-kun’s fault, or Yorka-chan’s?”</p>



<p>“Probably both.”</p>



<p>“…I don’t want Kisumi-kun to turn like he did during spring break.”</p>



<p>“During spring break?”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Kisumi-kun was acting strange the whole time. He was restless, doing many things but stopping suddenly. It was scary.”</p>



<p>I must have worried my sister when I waited for Yorka’s response to my confession.</p>



<p>“That’s why, you should make up properly!” Ei firmly told Yorka.</p>



<p>“Wow, Sena’s little sister is lecturing Arisaka-chan,” Nanamura murmured, earning a jab in the ribs from Miyachi. Nanamura, who was caught off guard, bent over in pain.</p>



<p>“Yeah, we’ll sort it out.”</p>



<p>“Ei likes Yorka-chan too, so let’s keep hanging out like this. It’s a promise.”</p>



<p>Yorka was moved and hugged Ei tightly. After Ei left the room, I finally faced Yorka again. “Yorka, I need you to listen to me and then decide.”</p>



<p>“I’m going to ask you some questions, please answer without hesitation.” Yorka also had this intention from the beginning.</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>“Did you cheat with my sister?”</p>



<p>“No, I didn’t.”</p>



<p>“What were you up to last night?” </p>



<p>“I had a meeting at Kanzaki-sensei’s apartment regarding the stand-in boyfriend matter. There were three of us.”</p>



<p>“Hmm… and you didn’t bother to let me know?”</p>



<p>“I was busy with preparations and had my phone off.”</p>



<p>“…all night?”</p>



<p>“The meeting had dragged on. And it would be troublesome if I got stopped by the police in my uniform if I wandered around at midnight.”</p>



<p>“You could’ve come back earlier, though. And why are you and my sister alone in the morning?”</p>



<p>“We were having breakfast. I’ve got the receipt from cafè if you need proof.”</p>



<p>Yorka, who had been firing off questions until now, hesitated slightly.</p>



<p>“What about at the station? Were you… embracing my sister?”</p>



<p>“I just stopped her from tripping.”</p>



<p>“It looked like you were kissing—”</p>



<p>“We weren’t!” I interjected loudly, eliciting relieved sighs from everyone.</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai, I’m sorry for jumping to conclusions,” Sayu apologized to me first.</p>



<p>“Thank you for being with Yorka all morning, Sayu.”</p>



<p>“Please don’t mislead girls with this kind of kindness that can cause misunderstandings. Are you satisfied now, Asa-senpai?” Sayu glanced at Asaki-san, awaiting her reaction.</p>



<p>Since the incident in the cafeteria, things had been awkward between Asaki-san and me, and we had only exchanged superficial greetings. Speaking face to face like this felt like long-overdue.</p>



<p>“My situation hasn’t changed at all. If anything, it’s just beginning.” Asaki-san’s gaze was looking straight at me as usual. With a newfound sense of clarity, she smiled as though she had finally let go of any lingering doubts.</p>



<p>“Alright, now that the question’s been cleared up, shall we move on to the next topic?” </p>



<p>Miyachi stood at the center of the room. </p>



<p>“I consulted with everyone before coming here. We also want Kanzaki-sensei to remain our homeroom teacher in the future. So, we thought of backing you up, Sumisumi.”</p>



<p>“In other words, there are a lot of folks here fretting about you being alone with another woman. So, instead of helping out, it’s more like demanding better information sharing,” Nanamura said bluntly.</p>



<p>I smiled wryly, “Thank you. I had the same idea.”</p>



<p>Sometimes, the worst timing and the best timing could coincide.</p>



<p>“I don’t mind the stand-in boyfriend plan as long as it could avoid Kanzaki-sensei’s arranged marriage. However, it’s a risky gamble and relies on elaborate lies. Even if Aria-san’s plan seems promising, there’s no guarantee it’ll succeed. That’s why I want everyone to be prepared for any unforeseen circumstances.”</p>



<p>I sought their assistance in executing the plan against the arranged marriage.</p>



<p>“Yorka, I know you’re not thrilled about this because it’s for Kanzaki-sensei’s sake. But I need you,” I emphasized, her cooperation was crucial to the plan.</p>



<p>Then I conveyed my hypothesis to everyone.</p>



<p>“I also have something to discuss with Kisumi.”</p>



<p>After discussion, everyone including Yorka finally agreed.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, as class rep, I agree with your plan for Kanzaki-sensei. But, I have one question.”</p>



<p>“What is it, Asaki-san?”</p>



<p>“I understand why you insist on trusting Arisaka-san considering she helped you get into our school. But why were you so fixated on getting into Eisei in the first place?”</p>



<p>“It’s close to home, and if you’re thinking about college entrance exams, it’s good to aim for a school with a high standard,” I replied casually.</p>



<p>“Is that really it? It feels like a weak reason for studying desperately,” Asaki-san scrutinized me with narrowed eyes.</p>



<p>“Do I have to say it?” </p>



<p>“I’d like to know.”</p>



<p>The members of the Sena Club were also waiting for my response.</p>



<p>Since I’d already involved everyone to this extent, there was no choice but to be honest.</p>



<p>“It’s because of my sister. Two years ago, she was just a second grader and even more childish than she is now. She threw a fit because she didn’t want me to leave home if I went to a high school far away. Then I promised to get into the closest high school, which happened to be Eisei. I had to do it for her sake, and Aria-san made that possible,” I confessed while suppressing my embarrassment.</p>



<p>“Kisumi’s a siscon.” </p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun is such a siscon.” </p>



<p>“Sumisumi, you’re a real siscon, huh?” </p>



<p>“Ki-senpai, you’re a serious siscon.” </p>



<p>“Sena, your sister will eventually leave the nest.”</p>



<p>The reactions from the five people were expected.</p>



<p>“That’s why I didn’t want to say anything! By the time I got accepted, the one who was crying and throwing tantrums had completely forgotten about it!” </p>



<p>As laughter filled the room, Ei cautiously approached the door and asked, “Did you guys make up?”</p>
