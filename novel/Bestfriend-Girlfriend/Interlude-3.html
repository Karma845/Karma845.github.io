<h3>Interlude Ⅲ</h3>


<p>“Hey, Asaki-chan, what were you talking about with Yukinami-san at karaoke the other day?” I noticed Sumisumi’s absent-mindedness and asked Asaki-chan when she was alone.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry, I can’t spill the beans on our private conversation. But why do you want to know?” Despite her gentle refusal, Asaki-chan showed interest.</p>



<p>“I just had this feeling that something’s off with Sumisumi, and maybe Yukinami-san is involved somehow…”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it just because Arisaka-san is absent?”</p>



<p>“If it were something that simple, he’d have directly told Nanamu or me.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t it better not to pry into things that he doesn’t want to tell?”</p>



<p>“I always want to be ready to help.”</p>



<p>“Hinaka-chan cares a lot about her friends, huh?”</p>



<p>“Aren’t you the same, Asaki-chan?” The image I had of Hasekura Asaki was that of a model student at the center of everyone’s attention, with a great deal of popularity.</p>



<p>“Just because I’m a class rep doesn’t mean I’m like Kisumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“Well, Sumisumi is pretty meddlesome.”</p>



<p>“And easily dragged into things.”</p>



<p>“Though he tries to hide it, it’s subtly apparent.” Prompted by Asaki-chan, the conversation about Sena Kisumi flowed naturally.</p>



<p>“He’s an honest guy who can’t lie.”</p>



<p>“I worry about him stressing out from being too considerate.”</p>



<p>“He’s a bit slow in some aspects, but surprisingly resilient.”</p>



<p>“—Even regarding a girl’s feelings?” I threw that question at Asaki-chan and observed her reaction closely.</p>



<p>“He doesn’t take the bait even when I try to tease him.”</p>



<p>She was a step ahead of me. “Hey, Hinaka-chan, weren’t you wary of me until recently?”</p>



<p>“In the past, yes. But that became pretty irrelevant a long time ago.” I spoke in past tense.</p>



<p>“Ah… so we used to be in the same boat. I had no idea.” Asaki-chan quickly caught on. Her sharpness was impressive.</p>



<p>“I never told anyone about it.”</p>



<p>“Hinaka-chan, did you confess to him?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I did. He turned me down, though.”</p>



<p>“Hmm, I thought you and Kisumi-kun were close, but I didn’t expect it to be that way.”</p>



<p>“Is it wrong for a small girl like me to want a boyfriend?”</p>



<p>“Hinaka-chan, you’re cute. Much more straightforward and honest than I am.”</p>



<p>As we locked eyes, we burst into laughter.</p>



<p>“Another one’s joining in.”</p>



<p>I understood something from Asaki-chan’s tone.</p>



<p>“Yukinami-san, right? The way she looked at Sumisumi from the beginning wasn’t just that of a senpai. Did Sumisumi feel down after he rejected her?”</p>



<p>“He doesn’t even realize someone likes him until they confessed, what’s wrong with this guy?” It was unusual to hear Asaki-chan’s complain.</p>



<p>“Actually, I think Sumisumi isn’t dense. He’s really calm with anyone other than the girl he likes. He treats everyone equally, regardless of gender or type.”</p>



<p>Our class had students of various types. Sena Kisumi being chosen as the class representative might be due to his ability to bring together and connect students with diverse personalities. He didn’t lean towards anyone and remained impartial.</p>



<p>“Ah, that makes a lot of sense!” Asaki-chan nodded, seemingly enlightened, “…But from the perspective of someone with unrequited love, it seems quite cruel.”</p>



<p>She mumbled, looking somewhat lonely.</p>



<p>“Isn’t falling in love our own choice?”</p>



<p>“Love is complicated.”</p>



<p>“Indeed.”</p>



<p>We keenly felt the absurdity of the monster called love.</p>



<p>“I wonder if Sayu-chan is okay.”</p>



<p>“If you’re going to comfort her, count me in.”</p>



<p>When I suggested that, Asaki-chan hesitated before confessing.</p>



<p>“Actually, this morning, I received a message from Sayu-chan saying she’s more regretful than upset about being rejected. I tried asking her about it, but she hasn’t responded. It seems she’s not just shocked by the rejection.”</p>



<p>“Hmm? Then what’s bothering Sumisumi?”</p>



<p>That changed the perspective.</p>



<p>“I don’t know yet. But it seems to be more complicated than we expected.”</p>



<p>“Sumisumi is also having a hard time settling down.”</p>



<p>“…It’s a good thing that Arisaka-san is off today.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, if she found out he’s troubled over another girl, there might be a storm of blood.”</p>



<p>Knowing Yoryor’s fervor and determination in critical situations, we couldn’t help but imagine a somewhat humorous scenario.</p>
