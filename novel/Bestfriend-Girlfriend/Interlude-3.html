<h3>Interlude 3 - A small desire to monopolize</h3>



<p>However, she wasn&#8217;t angry with Yuuma.</p>



<p>It was obvious that something was troubling him, and he was always there for Yui when she needed him. That&#8217;s why she thought it was no problem if she needed to wait for him a little.</p>



<p>(Besides, I think Yuuma&#8217;s probably consulting with Nene.)</p>



<p>Yui actually saw Nene and Yuuma disappear into the back of the store.</p>



<p>So she guessed that 『Maybe Yuuma was consulting with Nene』 and decided to wait quietly like this.</p>



<p>Although they didn&#8217;t speak often, Nene was dependable, and she was an adult. So she decided to entrust things to her rather than be too intrusive. She was undoubtedly sure that Nene would cheer Yuuma up.</p>



<p>…She knew this in her head. But──</p>



<p>(I wonder what it is…somehow, my chest feels hazy.)</p>



<p>She wasn&#8217;t able to put it into words smoothly, but it was a bad feeling. Yui placed her hands gently on her chest.</p>



<p>(Am I feeling jealous of how well she&#8217;s getting along with Yuuma?)</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sure that&#8217;s what it is.&#8221; She thought as she nodded her head in agreement.</p>



<p>(I rather Yuuma be my older brother and I a younger sister. Because then, I would be able to eat together with Yuuma every day, play together with Yuuma every day, make him spoil me as much as possible, and sleep together with him…)</p>



<p>Yui let out a small sigh.</p>



<p>(For some reason, recently…I can only think of Yuuma…)</p>



<p>&#8220;Yui, are you still changing?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hyah!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuuma called out to her unknowingly from outside of the fitting room, which left Yui surprised. In a panic, she rushed out of the fitting room.</p>



<p>&#8220;O-Okay. Um…it was a very long time.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sorry. I was talking to my Onee-chan just now.&#8221;</p>



<p>A moment ago, he seemed to be in low spirits, but now he looked okay.</p>



<p>Nene must have given him some good advice, Yui thought.</p>



<p>…It should&#8217;ve been a good thing, but now, her chest was feeling hazy again.</p>



<p>She may not be dependable, but she still wanted him to rely on her.</p>



<p>She wanted to listen to his problems and help him. Even if she couldn&#8217;t help him, she wanted to stay by his side and comfort him.</p>



<p>(I&#8217;m Yuuma&#8217;s best friend, but I wonder, does Yuuma just look at me as one of his many friends…?)</p>



<p>As she thought about such a thing, she shook her head.</p>



<p>(No, this thought is too selfish.)</p>



<p>After that, they chose their clothes together again.</p>



<p>Yuuma began praising her more than usual, saying that she 『cute』. It still felt a little awkward, but she was happy to have him pat her on the head from time to time.</p>



<p>…But, it&#8217;s not enough.</p>



<p>Before long, school will begin, and the very thought of her spending less time together with Yui made her want to have him pet her on the head even more.</p>



<p>(No. It&#8217;s still not enough, I&#8217;m sure.)</p>



<p>She wanted him to hug her tightly. She wanted him to pat her head and pamper her lots. …She wanted him to do it even more affectionally, without reserve.</p>



<p>(Yuuma still seems to be holding back because I&#8217;m a girl, but he doesn&#8217;t have to worry about it at all…because I want him to do it even more.)</p>



<p>Yui&#8217;s lips twitched as if she was flustered.</p>



<p>After shopping, they wandered around the city at random, and after that, he dropped her off as usual.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um…Yuuma. Thank you for today.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, I had a good time too. See you tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>He smiled and said goodbye.</p>



<p>But…she felt really lonely. It wasn&#8217;t enough. She wanted to be with him more.</p>



<p>Yuuma turned his back on her and walked away.</p>



<p>──After this, Yuuma will return to the house where Nene is. I&#8217;m sure the two of them will have a nice dinner together. She suddenly thought about that.</p>



<p>It was obvious, and yet, just thinking about it made her chest feel hazy again. The more she thought about it, the more the haze grew. She was jealous. She wanted to be together with Yuuma even more…</p>



<p>──I can&#8217;t take it anymore.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yuuma, wait!&#8221;</p>



<p>She found herself running.</p>



<p>Holding on to Yuuma&#8217;s arms tightly, she stopped him from running.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yui? What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, that? Um…&#8221;</p>



<p>She looked up at Yuuma, who had a surprised look on his face, and then said──</p>



<p>&#8220;T-Today! M-My house! W…Won&#8217;t you stay over today!?&#8221;</p>
