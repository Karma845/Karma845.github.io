<h3>Interlude Ⅲ</h3>


<p>We, the members of the Sena Club, also gathered at the hotel where Sumisumi met Kanzaki-sensei’s parents.</p>



<p>The restaurant’s location was shared via LINE beforehand. Sumisumi’s contingency plan was for everyone to rush in as reinforcements if the original plan went south.</p>



<p>Following Asaki-chan’s suggestion, we all wore our school uniforms for easy identification.</p>



<p>And just as Sumisumi predicted, Yoryor’s older sister, sporting sunglasses, was casually waiting on a sofa on the restaurant floor. </p>



<p>“Hey, everyone. Nice to see you again.”</p>



<p>Upon noticing us, she greeted us warmly.</p>



<p>“Oh, you’re on <em>that</em> side,” Yoryor’s sister said disappointedly while looking at Asaki-chan.</p>



<p>“Why did you even make a plan that would inevitably fail? And it would be you who would suffer the most when it failed, right, Arisaka-san’s sister?”</p>



<p>“That’s harsh. I’m genuinely concerned about Shizuru-chan.”</p>



<p>“Then why did you lash out at me in the cafeteria?”</p>



<p>At that moment, Yoryor’s sister’s expression changed.</p>



<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>



<p>“You deliberately provoked a fight between me and Arisaka-san to deflect criticism towards Kisumi-kun. Aren’t you quite overprotective?”</p>



<p>“Well, I was the one who dragged him into th—”</p>



<p>“Onee-chan, you treat Kisumi differently, don’t you?” Yoryor interjected into the conversation.</p>



<p>“Oh, so yesterday’s enemy is today’s friend?”</p>



<p>“Don’t try to dodge. I’m asking sincerely,” Yoryor stood before her sister with a determined expression.</p>



<p>“We’ll talk about this later. Since Shizuru-chan is working hard now, it’d be best not to interfere. Your intrusion is unwelcome.”</p>



<p>The older sister rose to her feet and blocked our path. </p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun mentioned this himself, that he’ll fail as a stand-in boyfriend if he’s on his own,” Asaki-chan stood beside Yoryor. </p>



<p>“He always underestimates himself. If only he had a bit more confidence.”</p>



<p>“I agree. But I think Kisumi-kun’s modesty is part of his charm.”</p>



<p>“…You have the guts to say that in front of Yor-chan, huh?”</p>



<p>Yoryor’s sister assessed us with a glance.</p>



<p>“If anything, it’s impressive how confident you are. Aren’t you planning to swoop in at the crucial moment when Kisumi-kun and Sensei are cornered so you can resolve everything smoothly? You really know how to seize the opportunity.”</p>



<p>Asaki-san provocatively smiled with a refreshing expression.</p>



<p>“…..”</p>



<p>The older sister lowered her sunglasses slightly and shot us a displeased look.</p>



<p>“Hasekura-san, I’ll leave the inside to you. Go ahead,” Yoryor said.</p>



<p>“Are you really handing over the good part?”</p>



<p>“Aren’t you a class rep? Your partner is working hard for our homeroom teacher, so go lend him a hand.”</p>



<p>Yoryor entrusted Asaki-chan with this task. It was a weighty baton that surpassed any challenge or trust.</p>



<p>“—If Kisumi-kun has a change of heart, don’t complain.</p>



<p>“That’s impossible,” Yoryor scoffed.</p>



<p>Asaki-san took the lead towards the restaurant.</p>



<p>“What’s gotten into you, Yor-chan? You’re surprisingly bold.”</p>



<p>“I want to talk to you alone, onee-chan. Let’s have a sister quarrel here.”</p>



<p>“…That sounds interesting.”</p>



<p>Yoryor’s sister stepped aside easily to clear out our path.</p>



<p>“Then, we’ll assist Sena.”</p>



<p>“Indeed. Don’t mind us, Yor-senpai!”</p>



<p>Nanamu and Sayu-chan followed suit.</p>



<p>“Hinaka-chan too, let’s go. She’ll be fine.”</p>



<p>“Yoryor…” </p>



<p>Just like during the inter-class ball game, Sumisumi had secretly asked me a favor. He was worried that Yoryor might get pressured when talking to her sister. </p>



<p>However, that was an unnecessary concern. </p>



<p>The current Arisaka Yorka could handle it.</p>



<p>“Good luck!” I called out to her back then hurried to catch up with everyone.</p>
