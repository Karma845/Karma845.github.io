<h1>Chapter 3: The Camellia Sisters Approach Stealthily</h1>

<h3>She&#8217;s a Fake Foreigner</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the morning of the first day of summer vacation, when I woke up, Saori-chan was peering at my face from the side of the bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go-Good morning&#8230;O-Onii-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just to make it clear, I didn&#8217;t bring her here or anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even I wouldn&#8217;t lay a hand on my cute little sister.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In reality, it was Ryoko I held last night, not her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I left Takata-san to Lili and enjoyed Ryoko&#8217;s cooking and her company at her apartment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her cooking was really delicious, and embracing her outside the 『King&#8217;s Confinement Room』 was a refreshing experience.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, late at night, I returned to my room and slipped into bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230; Good morning, Saori-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for why she was in my room, it quickly dawned on me when I considered her sporty attire of a practice shirt and shorts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to Saori-chan&#8217;s parents becoming members of the local neighbourhood association, she had to take on the role of being the older sister leading the morning radio callisthenics for the children during this summer vacation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, even though it was for children, the thought of being in front of people was quite daunting for her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we walked to school in the morning, I couldn&#8217;t just ignore her anxious words. I ended up saying, [Well, I&#8217;ll do it with you].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, it seems she came all the way to wake me up because she was worried I might oversleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If it were a situation where a girl came to wake you up in the morning, one might hope for a romantic comedy scenario to unfold. However, expecting that from Saori-chan, who is serious and reserved, would be unreasonable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quickly got ready and headed with her to the park in the residential area, which was the gathering spot for the radio callisthenics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, the neighbourhood kids had already gathered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re slow, Fumio!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be lazy, Fumio!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Annoying little brats, turned into irritating kids. The discontented voices came from the elementary school kids who lived on both sides of us. The Marubozu kids. Probably the reserves for potential bullies.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Bald]</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Should I nip this dangerous situation in the bud early?’</span></i></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost simultaneously with my immature thoughts, Saori-chan tugged at the hem of my shirt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“On-Onii-chan, let&#8217;s start, okay?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You kids are lucky!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While grumbling internally like that, I pressed the switch of the vintage cassette player and began the radio callisthenics.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finishing the first set, then the second, and finally stamping the cards the kids had brought with them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The kids might not be cute, but getting their bodies moving was a good thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling refreshed as I looked back, I met Saori-chan&#8217;s gaze, and she smiled gently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good job. Onii-chan, if you&#8217;re up for it, would you like to come over to my place now? My mom has cut some watermelon…”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I said, [Sure] she happily exclaimed, [Yay!] and jumped up and down. It was cute. I could empathise painfully well with the feelings of those elder brothers with sister complexes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I believed that Saori-chan&#8217;s fondness for me was until she got a boyfriend, but the current dynamic was very comfortable for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The early morning sunlight was gentle and the summer sky stretched high above.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though it seemed like it would get hot today too, at this time of day, it was still quite cool.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saori-chan and I were sitting on a makeshift bench in a corner of the residential area, right by her house. Her father had simply placed a board over a crate of beer bottles to create this simple bench. We were munching on watermelon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Though it was a regular road, it was part of a suburban neighbourhood in a provincial city. Furthermore, in the early morning, there wasn&#8217;t a single car passing by, just the occasional neighbourhood lady walking her dog.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We exchanged a slight nod, and the lady smiled with a look that seemed to find our situation endearing as she walked past, saying things like, [Oh, how niceー!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The watermelon was incredibly sweet. It was nice and cold. Both of us enthusiastically took big bites, spitting out the seeds with [pepepe] sounds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We somehow found ourselves competing over how far we could spit the seeds, experiencing a mix of excitement and disappointment over who won and lost, all while sharing laughter.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Disregard for proper manners aside, this was how you were supposed to eat watermelon on a porch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it wasn&#8217;t exactly a porch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Onii-chan, are you going anywhere during the summer vacation?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saori-chan reached for a new slice of watermelon and asked.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I do have a few plans&#8230;the closest one is tomorrow. I&#8217;m supposed to accompany a classmate who&#8217;s a model to a photoshoot in Tokyo.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!? A model!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saori-chan&#8217;s eyes widened.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Certainly, there&#8217;s no way the words [model] and [me] would ever be associated, but isn&#8217;t she a bit too surprised?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, I&#8217;m just going to be a bag carrier. But I&#8217;m curious to see what a photoshoot is like. Well, I thought it could be interesting, so I agreed. Do you have any plans, Saori-chan?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh&#8230;well, it&#8217;s not so much plans, but&#8230;I have a tournament after the Obon holiday, so I&#8217;ll be busy with club activities until then. It seems a new coach is starting today…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Sounds like quite a challenge.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had received a report from Ryoko that the faculty advisor for the track and field club was under investigation for his involvement in a kidnapping case. The mention of a new coach likely meant they were hiring someone to replace the current advisor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un&#8230;I hope the new coach isn&#8217;t too strict. The third-year students are really motivated because it&#8217;s their last tournament, and if the coach is too tough on top of that, they might be pushed too hard and burn out.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Which means around Obon, Tashiro-san and Kei-chan will probably be busy..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I absentmindedly thought about that, Saori-chan turned towards me with a somewhat nervous expression.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, Onii-chan&#8230;If it&#8217;s okay with you&#8230; well&#8230; the thing is, if I asked you to come watch the tournament, would that be a bother&#8230;? I think I could do my best if you were there to cheer for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, I&#8217;d be happy to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really!? Yay!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saori-chan raised both hands in excitement, then continued to smile as she reached for another slice of watermelon. If she could be this happy just from the idea of me coming to support her, it made me happy too.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at the moment when I was about to reach for another piece of watermelon, I felt an unsettling presence and looked around.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What&#8217;s….?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, hiding in the shadow of a nearby utility pole, was a girl who was staring intently at us.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Long blonde hair down to her waist, vivid blue&#8230; or rather, odd eyes, I suppose. One eye seemed to have a slight tinge of purple.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A foreign girl with fair white skin. Her legs extending from the low-rise denim hotpants were long, and her upper body, covered only by a layered camisole, looked slender.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This incredibly conspicuous girl seemed to be gazing at us with an envious expression.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What&#8217;s with her?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if she&#8217;s a complete stranger, being looked at like that makes it hard to enjoy the meal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230; Would you like some?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I forced a smile and asked, she nodded in agreement and stepped out from behind the utility pole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Saori-chan exclaimed, [Hya!?] and jumped. It seems she hadn&#8217;t noticed the foreign girl&#8217;s presence.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The foreign girl accepted the watermelon and started munching on it, her face lighting up with a big smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While looking up at her with a puzzled expression, Saori-chan whispered to me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What should we do? Big brother, I-I can&#8217;t speak English.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s okay, leave it to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My English grades aren&#8217;t bad, and I&#8217;m sure I can manage somehow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my slightly affected pronunciation, I asked the girl for her name in English. Saori-chan looked at me with a gaze of admiration and said, [Big brother, you&#8217;re amazing!] It felt good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the foreign girl had a somewhat apologetic expression and said the following.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry, I don&#8217;t understand English.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">An unexpected strike. It hurt my pride as much as I tried to put on a show.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“O-Onii-chan, it&#8217;s okay! She just wasn&#8217;t from an English-speaking country. But you looked so cool!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saori-chan&#8217;s consideration made my heart ache even more.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, I was born and raised in Japan. Sorry for pretending to be a fake foreigner.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh&#8230; I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Now that she mentioned it, while her facial features were foreign, her expressions were Japanese. It felt quite odd.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I actually moved into this neighbourhood yesterday. I was taking a walk with the intention of exploring, and I saw you guys enjoying the watermelon so much…”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you a neighbour?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, because of my sister&#8217;s job, we moved here from Onomichi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, what does your sister do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She&#8217;s a coach for track and field. She&#8217;s going to be coaching at a school nearby, and I&#8217;ll be attending there starting the new term.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Both Saori-chan and I exchanged glances at that revelation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Claudia, where did you go so early in the morning?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just for a little walk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumio and Saori. After having various conversations and enjoying watermelon, I returned home to find my sister preparing breakfast for us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll be leaving soon, so once you&#8217;ve eaten, make sure to change quickly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, starting at a new school&#8230;it&#8217;s definitely something to look forward to.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The unpacking from the move was mostly done.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After this, my sister would be making her first appearance at the school&#8217;s track and field club. I, on the other hand, would be going through the process of transferring to the new school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh yeah, sis. I met an interesting kid during the walk.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Interesting kid?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumio Kijima.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My sister&#8217;s face suddenly showed surprise.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, I certainly didn&#8217;t expect to meet the suspect himself so unexpectedly.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How was it?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Normal. Just a completely normal boy you&#8217;d find anywhere. We only chatted about general stuff today, and he didn&#8217;t seem to lie about anything&#8230;Was it Tachioka? I feel like the possibility of his misunderstanding is higher. After all, he was full of lies even during our investigation. Honestly, I dislike that guy.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon hearing that, my sister frowned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Claudia, jumping to conclusions is not a good idea. Even if he wasn&#8217;t lying, there could be rare cases like split personalities.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I know, I know. Today&#8217;s conversation was all harmless stuff. And while he might not have lied, that doesn&#8217;t mean there&#8217;s no issue with Fumio&#8230;he was constantly staring at my chest. He&#8217;s a full-blown pervert. Also, the girl who was with him&#8230;that Saori girl. Honestly, I&#8217;m more curious about her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Curious about her?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I couldn&#8217;t tell if she was lying or telling the truth. Her story, I mean.”</span></p>

<h3>Lies, lies, it&#039;s all lies.</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While eating watermelon, I spent a delightful time with Saori-chan and Claudia. Enjoying watermelon with a cute little sister figure and a beautiful foreign lady. It&#8217;s truly a luxurious way to start the summer vacation.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I have a feeling this summer vacation might bring some good things!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With such thoughts in mind, I returned home humming a tune and the clock&#8217;s hands had just passed eight in the morning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Feeling sticky from watermelon juice and sweat, I decided to take a shower first.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I washed my hair, I pondered.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But seriously, Claudia was cute…’</span></i></p>

<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just the fact that I got to meet a foreign girl made me somewhat happy. Yeah, it&#8217;s the concept of a global society. And on top of that, if that girl happens to be beautiful, there&#8217;s nothing more to say.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a moment, the words [captive] flashed through my mind like a caption and I shook my head vigorously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I definitely couldn&#8217;t just impulsively resort to something like captivity.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to kidnap someone just because I found them cute, I wouldn&#8217;t just be a bad person, but more like a devil incarnate.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8216;Well, but&#8230; it would be nice if we could become friends, at least.&#8217;</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought to myself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saori-chan was also a bit nervous, but there was an air of enjoyment in her communication with the foreign girl. When Saori mentioned that she was a member of the track and field team coached by her sister, Claudia seemed quite surprised too. That&#8217;s only natural. Such coincidences don&#8217;t happen often.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“C-claudia, what kind of person is your sister?”</span></p>
<div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-67123855' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-67123855' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saori-chan&#8217;s curiosity about the new coach was clear. However, Claudia&#8217;s response to her question, [She&#8217;s kind to me] was not really helpful at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Claudia left, she waved and said, [See you later, Fumio, Saori!] with a cheerful smile.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I hope we can become good friends…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the shower water pouring over me, I fell into my usual daydream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the new school term, she becomes a transfer student and enters the classroom. When she spots me, she excitedly exclaims, [Fumio&#8217;s here! Yay!] and rushes over, causing everyone to focus their attention on me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such fantasies. Yeah, I have to admit, even I find them cringe-worthy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I wiped my wet hair with a towel and returned to my room, Lili appeared almost as if she had timed it.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Masaki-chan is here? At this hour?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She&#8217;s in the dining hall, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We hadn&#8217;t made any particular plans, and it was still early morning, to say the least.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I guess I&#8217;ll find out if I go…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After drying my hair to a certain extent, I tilted my head and conjured a door into existence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Stepping into the dining hall, I was met with the sight of the first-year maids who used to be in the track and field team, standing at attention and loudly reciting in unison.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「「「Good morning, Great King of Confinement! Thanks to the Confinement King, we are living happily every day!」」」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I offered a wry smile and waved my hand in response.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘As always&#8230; I still can&#8217;t get used to this…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had asked Lili to stop being so exaggerated about it; it&#8217;s really over the top. But she didn&#8217;t seem to take it to heart, saying it&#8217;s one of her training methods.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking around the dining hall, besides the maids, there was Kyoko in a sweet Lolita dress, engaged in conversation at a table facing the courtyard. Another woman was with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of the women we rescued along with Kurosawa-san when we saved her. She&#8217;s Kanaya Chihiro, who chose to stay here because she had nowhere else to go.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘She&#8217;s probably around the same age as Kyoko..’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at the table closer to me were Masaki-chan and Kayama-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Good morning, Fumio-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Co-Confinement King! Good morning!”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan smiled cheerfully, while Kayama-san hurriedly stood up with a nervous expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan was dressed in a casual outfit, a T-shirt paired with culottes. On the other hand, Kayama-san was wearing the school&#8217;s gym uniform.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why the gym uniform?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t have many clothes with me…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She bit her lip and murmured in a sort of groan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed like I had unintentionally asked something I shouldn&#8217;t have.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, on the way back, you can take any clothes you like from the [wardrobe room].”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh? Th-That&#8217;s too much…”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring Kayama-san&#8217;s confusion, I exchanged a glance with Masaki-chan, and she gave me a cheerful smile.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lately, it felt like I could communicate with Masaki-chan through just our gazes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Telepathy, perhaps. I knew she would choose clothes that suit Kayama-san and make sure she takes them home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I took my seat, a maid hurriedly brought coffee and a fruit platter to the table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what brings you here so early in the morning?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I reached for a cup, Masaki-chan smiled and answered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, Un. It&#8217;s not that I came expecting Fumio-kun to be here. I actually came to ask the maids for guidance on a matter involving Yui-chan today.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guidance?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually&#8230;Yui-chan has started working as a live-in maid. She&#8217;s going to work at Mai-chan&#8217;s mansion with her mother.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;sorry?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I thought this was about asking for help with that job she mentioned earlier, but it seems the conversation has taken an unexpected turn.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, you see, I was surprised during the interview. Mai-chan&#8217;s dad. He was someone who knew Yui-chan quite well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kayama-san nodded along with a thoughtful expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I was truly astonished to learn that Mai-chan&#8217;s father was Fujiwara Masataka&#8230; It turns out they had some kind of interaction before.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_8 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“They had connections through their fathers and had met several times at parties.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Although our family and the Fujiwara are from completely different social classes, we have fond memories of how kindly they treated us.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘I see, their fathers were friends…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And there&#8217;s another reason they&#8217;re being treated specially.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Another reason?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un, Mai-chan&#8217;s Papa. He was a huge fan of Yui-chan&#8217;s mom!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh!? What&#8217;s that? What do you mean?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, my mom wasn&#8217;t that famous, but when she was single, she worked as an actress under the stage name Aoi Umidori. Fujiwara Masataka-sama was&#8230; a devoted follower of hers…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait, that conniving old man!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but react with surprise. In response, Masaki-chan opened her mouth with a cheerful tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was like a highlight of her dad&#8217;s youth, Yui-chan&#8217;s mom. When she got married and retired, he even had her company release a 『Aoi Umidori Complete Video Box: 30-Volume Set』 that covered all of her appearances. The way he mixes personal and professional is on a whole different level.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaa…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Even during the interview, when Yui-chan&#8217;s mom mentioned she was working a late-night part-time job at a canning factory, he started talking about buying the factory and making Yui-chan&#8217;s mom the director. Mai-chan and her mom had to quickly intervene to stop him.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But having such a big fan hire his admired actress as a live-in maid&#8230;isn&#8217;t that a bit strange?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, so, the live-in arrangement&#8230;does that mean he&#8217;s trying to make her his mistress or something?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un, well, that&#8217;s what most people would think.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s hard to think of anything else.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But apparently, it&#8217;s different. He can&#8217;t bring himself to meet her face-to-face out of embarrassment, but he doesn&#8217;t want his admired person, to whom he devoted his youth, to suffer. Mai-chan and her mom were both like 『Here we go again…』 with exasperated expressions, so I really think that&#8217;s the case.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So pure-hearted!!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Kayama-san hesitated and spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So&#8230; that&#8217;s why&#8230; my mother and I have been employed as Mai-san&#8217;s maid and home tutor, with very little direct interaction with Masataka-sama.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Home tutor?”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, to instruct her in how to behave and speak as an upper-class young lady.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I see, since Fujiwara-san was just a commoner until recently, there&#8217;s still much for her to learn about that world. In that sense, although she may be financially struggling now, Kayama-san, as a genuine young lady, is indeed perfect for the role of a home tutor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I nodded in understanding, Masaki-chan gave a wry smile and continued.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To be honest, I don&#8217;t think Mai’s Papa has any intentions of making her work. He&#8217;s wealthy enough to support one or two people without any issues, and the atmosphere was more like he wanted to offer protection. Well, I guess that makes sense. She devoted her youth to her career as an actress. It&#8217;s a bit sad to think of Kayama-san’s mother covered in crab stick paste in a canning factory…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But I have no intention of relying on him, so I&#8217;ve come to ask for guidance from Saito-san and Inui-san to ensure I can perform my duties properly. They may be our classmates, but I&#8217;ve heard that they&#8217;ve received thorough training as maids…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, Kayama-san clenched her fist with determination.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you know…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I glanced at the maids&#8217; faces, they stood rigidly upright, almost as if they were statues.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The maids here are in a bit of a special situation, you see…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Whether these girls, who have been moulded to worship me like a deity, will actually be helpful or not&#8230; I have my doubts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Today, our new coach has arrived! First, let&#8217;s introduce ourselves! Coach Yolanda, please say a few words!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A tall girl with a ponytail, who seemed to be the club president, turned and addressed my sister. We were gathered in front of the club building located in a corner of the schoolyard. I sat on a bench a little further away, casually observing their activities.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘At least from here, I can vaguely hear what&#8217;s being said.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From my perspective, the number of club members didn&#8217;t seem to be that large. I counted only twelve of them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My sister stepped forward and scanned the members before speaking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m Yolanda Camellia. Starting today, I&#8217;ll be your coach. I&#8217;m aware of the unique circumstances you all went through, including the 『kidnapping』 incident. Some of you might have comments to make, but if we can achieve good results in the competition three weeks from now, we can prove our worth to those who doubt us. I&#8217;m expecting great effort from everyone!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, a quiet round of applause echoed among the club members.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As my sister just mentioned, this track and field club had an unusual situation. The majority of its members were victims of a kidnapping incident. Furthermore, among the first-year students, four were still missing. I had heard that some had already quit the club.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At home, my sister was also frustrated. She had taken on the role of coach, but the club was no longer functioning as a [track and field team].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, she couldn&#8217;t voice such concerns here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The surprised expressions on the club members&#8217; faces were likely because my sister had spoken in regular Japanese. For us, it was a familiar sight.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although my sister was born in Rome, she had been in Japan since she was two years old. As a pseudo-foreigner, she wasn&#8217;t much different from me, a born-and-raised Onomichi local.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lost in these unimportant thoughts, my sister&#8217;s gaze briefly turned toward me.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Alright, alright, I&#8217;m paying attention…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way, I&#8217;ve heard that none of you remember anything about the kidnapping incident. Is that true?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon my sister&#8217;s question, the club president and the short-haired girl next to her exchanged glances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Umu, Coach, it&#8217;s true. Unfortunately, we don&#8217;t remember anything at all”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment the club president made that statement, her figure began to emit a reddish glow in my field of vision.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘She&#8217;s lying.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think I might have vaguely seen Teruya-chan&#8217;s sister, who got arrested, at the place where we were held captive,”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘ That girl with short hair&#8230; also lying.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Glancing around as if checking on our reactions, my sister continued to inquire.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It seems that in society, there&#8217;s quite an interest in the idea that you might have experienced something indecent…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ridiculous. There&#8217;s absolutely no way that happened,”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The club president exclaimed with a slightly irritated tone.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But this is also a lie…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, you have had no further contact with the perpetrator?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Of course not! There&#8217;s no way something like that would happen!”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘And that&#8217;s a critical lie. They are still in contact with the perpetrator. In other words, if I follow their actions, I could trace it back to the perpetrator. Whether that&#8217;s Fumio or not, I don&#8217;t know…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My sister surveyed the members while posing another question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is there anyone who remembers even a little bit about what happened during your kidnapping?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I don&#8217;t remember”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400"> They all chorused while turning into bright red.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There were four who didn&#8217;t show any colours, including Saori. Among these three, the reason they didn&#8217;t show any colours was simply because they didn&#8217;t say anything.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">One of them was standing there, leaning against Saori,sleeping while standing. This kid seemed incredibly carefree.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other might be one of the children who weren&#8217;t involved in the kidnapping, from what I had heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, keeping such a large number of people completely silent about a secret was an incredibly difficult task. Moreover, neither the club president nor the girl beside her seemed to show any discomfort in telling lies.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Considering my past experiences, this was a bit hard to believe.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;There&#8217;s a high possibility that they might be under some form of mental manipulation.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning my attention to one more person whose colour didn&#8217;t show, it was a girl who looked at me intently. She had a sullen expression, with a somewhat menacing look in her eyes.</span></p>
