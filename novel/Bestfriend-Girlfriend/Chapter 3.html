<h1>Chapter 3: Tera Awayuki Didn’t Receive Anything from Momo***o san, Really</h1>


<p>I’m exhausted…just utterly exhausted. <br /> <br />Returning home, I went straight to my room and flopped down face-first onto my bed.  <br /> <br />Transferring to Teio Academy, the appearance of mysterious choices in my head, encountering an angel, the fact my bad luck was truly just regular bad luck without cause, the implied synergy of that bad luck and the choices, meeting a quirky girl aspiring to be a superstar, the absurd debate match, the fact I ended up being celebrated in class due to misunderstandings, Hiratsuka Raichō.  <br /> <br />No good…too many things happened in quick succession, my head feels ready to burst. <br /> <br />It’s a bit early but I’ll soak in the bath and refresh– <br /> <br />Mom seems to have gone grocery shopping or something, no sign of anyone in the living room. I slip through there into the changing area and open the bathroom door– <br /> <br />“……Huh?” <br /> <br />A girl was soaking in the bath.  <br /> <br />Moreover, it was– <br /> <br />“…………Corone?” <br /> <br />The angel I encountered on the school roof. <br /> <br />“Wha–! Oops, perv–! Why’re you…in our bath?!” <br /> <br />As I’m plunged into confusion, Corone’s already flushed face turns even redder– <br /> <br />“Kyaaaaaaaaaaaaa!”  <br /> <br />And she lets out an ear-piercing scream. <br /> <br />“W-Wait, it’s a misunderstanding! I didn’t know you were in here–” <br /> <br />“You saw me playing with my rubber duckyyy!” <br /> <br />“That’s not the issue here!” <br /> <br />“Ahaha, were you surprised? Were you surprised?” <br /> <br />This brat…more acting huh. <br /> <br />No, more fundamentally–  <br /> <br />“Hey…why are you here?” <br /> <br />“Whaddya mean why, I’ll be in your care starting today!” <br /> <br />“Huh…?” <br /> <br />“I mean, it’s easier to support you if I stay by your side right?” <br /> <br />“Well yeah but…that doesn’t mean just moving into my place right… Plus aren’t you, y’know, not human?” <br /> <br />“All the paperwork is nicely fabricated and I have a study abroad student identity, so I can even attend your school.” <br /> <br />“You’re gonna come to school too…? More importantly, did you just waltz in here yourself?” <br /> <br />“As if~! Your mom’s out right now but I got her permission. I called and checked with your dad too, got the OK.” <br /> <br />This cat’s already got the outer moat filled in… No matter how suspicious an unplanned foreign student is, my crazy mom and dad would never turn down the fun prospect of a blonde homestay beauty.  <br /> <br />“But…where exactly are you planning to sleep and live?” <br /> <br />I hate to say this but our house is pretty big. <br /> <br />Aside from rooms for my parents, me, and my little sister (really studying abroad), we have some extras…but they’re overflowing with my parents’ enormous wardrobes and gifts from fans, no space livable for a person.  <br /> <br />“Ah, I’ll just sleep in Youta’s closet!” <br /> <br />No closets…why’s she settled on a classic hungry cat hiding spot… Nah, more like a cat right. <br /> <br />“So, what’re we gonna do nyaa?” <br /> <br />“What’re we gonna do about what?” <br /> <br />“Again-nyaa. When it’s just the two of us in the bath like this, aren’t you gonna do anything big brother?” <br /> <br />“No, obviously not…” <br /> <br />“Are you an idiot? Impotent?”  <br /> <br />“You’re the idiot!” <br /> <br />“Ahhaha. So naive Youta-chin. I know you don’t have the guts.” <br /> <br />She’s relaxing way too much… Of course I’ve got zero intention of doing anything, but her teasing nonstop is annoying.  <br /> <br />Some way to startle her a bit– <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />【Choose ] <br /> <br />① Show her my naked body. <br /> <br />② Mimic a newborn deer fawn while naked. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“You almost gave me a heart attack!” <br /> <br />“Oh, what was it? Another choice in your head?” <br /> <br />“Yeah…the worst kind.” <br /> <br />No wait, for 2 it just says mimic, not show… <br /> <br />“Corone…I’m going to do something now…so close your eyes. Absolutely don’t look, got it?” <br /> <br />“Ooh, what what?” <br /> <br />“…Don’t wanna say.”  <br /> <br />“Ehh, that just makes me curious. No waaay, gotta tell me or I won’t close my eyes.” <br /> <br />“Ugh…you promise not to look if I tell you?” <br /> <br />“Yes sirree.” <br /> <br />“I’ll…mimic a newborn deer fawn on all fours.” <br /> <br />“No way I won’t watch something that funny!” <br /> <br />“I’ll seriously punch you!” <br /> <br />“Doesn’t hurt to try~.” <br /> <br />“No way!” ……Oh, that’s right. <br /> <br />Right now I’ve opened the changing room door and am peeking into the bathroom.  <br /> <br />If I close this and prop it shut so it can’t open temporarily, that solves everything. <br /> <br />“What a shame.” <br /> <br />“Ah, you shut it! ……And I can’t open it no matter how much I jiggle the knob! Grr, sneaky Youta-chin!” <br /> <br />Phew…you slipped up, Mr. Choice. My win this time. <br /> <br />Right, better get this over with quick.  <br /> <br />I swiftly strip off all my clothes until fully nude. <br /> <br />Then get on all fours, folding my limbs and shaking all over. <br /> <br />There…my headache’s gone. Now to hurry and get dressed– <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“I’m home~ Youta, if you’re gonna run a bath do it before–” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“….Huh?” <br /> <br />The door to the living room side opened abruptly and in came–  <br /> <br />“M-Mom…?” <br /> <br />My actual mom standing right there. <br /> <br />Crapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrapcrap!! <br /> <br />“Youta…chan?” <br /> <br />Mom drops the grocery bags in her hands with a thud and covers her open mouth with both hands. <br /> <br />Then–  <br /> <br />“You don’t seem to have grown at all!” <br /> <br />“I have grown!” <br /> <br />And that’s not the issue here! <br /> <br />“It’s okay Youta, boys your age do things like this sometimes.” <br /> <br />“No they don’t! No one sane strips naked on all fours shaking just because they’re a teenager! Even if it is puberty!” <br /> <br />Well, I am actually doing that now… <br /> <br />“It’s fine. Your father did similar things when he was younger too.”  <br /> <br />“Nothing about this is remotely fine! Explain what exactly!” <br /> <br />My dad did this stuff naked? …At minimum, something’s off in his head.  <br /> <br />Then a carefree voice comes from the bathroom. <br /> <br />“Can I come out now Youta-chin?” <br /> <br />“Don’t make this an even deeper level of hell!” <br /> <br />“Oh my, Corone is in there? Well well, so it’s that sort of thing?” <br /> <br />“N-No mom, absolutely not! There’s a deep reason why I’m like this!” <br /> <br />“Youta probably doesn’t know since he’s a virgin, but foreplay doesn’t mean playing around in a naughty way before sex.” <br /> <br />“Apologize to all the virgins nationwide!” </p>






<p>“Haah…” <br /> <br />One thing and another, I didn’t get in the bath until after dinner. <br /> <br />During the meal, my naturally airheaded mom and mischievous Corone getting oddly friendly meant nonstop tsukkomi that combined with the mental fatigue from school earlier left my exhaustion at a max. <br /> <br />Just sleep immediately tonig– <br /> <br />“……Huh?” <br /> <br />Corone was doing a bridge on my bed. <br /> <br />“…………” <br /> <br />I silently closed the door, pinched my own cheek, then opened again. <br /> <br />Corone was doing a bridge on my bed. <br /> <br />“……………………What exactly are you doing?” <br /> <br />“Huh? Isn’t this the kinda thing that excites you?” <br /> <br />“Why’re you constantly trying to give people weird fetishes…” <br /> <br />“I was wondering at lunch too y’know. When I fell from the sky, which would Youta like more, sticking headfirst into the ground or bridging… So I picked that one.”  <br /> <br />Neither are remotely appealing, but bridging is far superior… So why’d she go with sticking in the ground. <br /> <br />“And why are you here anyway… We decided you’d use my sister room for now, right?”  <br /> <br />“Yehp, I got permission to sleep and stay in imouto-chan’s room until the others get cleaned up! So like, I’m pretty much Youta’s little sister now right?” <br /> <br />…That logic makes no sense whatsoever.  <br /> <br />Corone undoes the bridge and lies on her back, spreading her arms– <br /> <br />“So with that, please treat me as your little sister.” <br /> <br />“What are you saying!?” <br /> <br />“Nyahaha, teasing Youta is so fun. And wow, this bed is so soft and fluffy~” <br /> <br />After thoroughly enjoying the sensation, Corone– <br /> <br />“Wheee, rolly polly!” <br /> <br />“Don’t roll all over someone else’s bed!” <br /> <br />“Wheee, spinny spin!” <br /> <br />“Don’t spin all over someone else’s bed!” <br /> <br />“Wheee, barfy barf–ooooowaaaaah!” <br /> <br />“Don’t actually barf!” <br /> <br />“Nyahaha, so very naive.” <br /> <br />Seeming finally satisfied after frolicking and messing around freely, Corone then lies on her stomach resting her cheeks in both hands. <br /> <br />And looking up, she asks: <br /> <br />“Lemme ask you something? Why’re you so against standing out, Youta?” <br /> <br />…That struck right at the core of how I live my life.  <br /> <br />But the answer itself is very simple. <br /> <br />“Dad.”  <br /> <br />The fact I’m the son of those superstars [Hoshi Toru] and [Ozora Misaki]. Of course it’s not publicized, but even at local elementary schools it was common knowledge.  <br /> <br />Fed up with that, I desperately studied and somehow got into a private middle school a bit away from home–I even commuted by train to my original public high school, intentionally going quite far. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>While Teio I transferred to is closer than those, but no one there knows about my family situation aside from the Principal.  <br /> <br />If Teio was near my home, I would have refused the transfer no matter what. <br /> <br />That’s how much I don’t want people knowing I’m [Hoshi Toru]’s son. <br /> <br />“Papa? I talked to him just a little on the phone earlier, but he seemed like a mysterious guy. Kinda drew me in, felt like he had a real [presence].” <br /> <br />Yeah…even without meeting him directly, you can sense something that special about dad. <br /> <br />“Before we talk about dad, as his son I gotta say…isn’t mom a beauty?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Yeah, super pretty and she looks twenty-something tops. Her behavior and speech are cute too, seems like she could make it as a celebrity.”  <br /> <br />“She not just regular celeb, she was big time. Stage name Ozora Misaki–a wildly popular actress with the title Super before her name.” <br /> <br />“Ohh, I see. Gotcha gotcha.” <br /> <br />She may make less public appearances after marriage but that passionate popularity shows no signs of declining even now. Just occasional TV spots get a tremendous reaction on social media, and a mountain of fan letters and gifts come through her agency. <br /> <br />“Well, I can understand mom being super popular. Setting aside biased family eyes, her looks are top class and despite usually being doting, she’s a genius when acting. Her homemaking skills are also excellent–she was voted number one celebrity housewife fans want to marry, a very easy to understand national sweetheart actress–but dad’s different.”  <br /> <br />That’s right, Hoshi Toru is– <br /> <br />“Nothing particularly remarkable about his face or outstanding intellect. Athletic ability pretty much average, no exceptional talents either.”  <br /> <br />So what makes dad popular? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The answer is, I don’t know. <br /> </p>



<p>Yet he draws people in. <br /> <br />Through his words, actions, or maybe personality?  <br /> <br />The factors are totally unclear but the result is people gather around dad. <br /> <br />Then they cheer passionately, gaze with envy, and have their hearts set ablaze. <br /> <br />They’re rare but they exist. <br /> <br />Simply being there–people who are blessed for that mere fact.  <br /> <br />“Yet he became a star. For reasons I can’t grasp at all, dad’s been a superstar from when I first gained awareness up to now…”  <br /> <br />“Ahh, those kinds of people huh. Can’t put the charm into words but they just naturally become the center of the world. Like charisma transcending logic? There’s a lot of historical figures like that–hm? But if your dad is that amazing, wouldn’t you want to brag about him–” <br /> <br />“At first, yeah.”  <br /> <br />I immediately responded at the perfect pause in timing. <br /> <br />“Around preschool, I admired him. I thought when I grew up, I wanted to be a sparkling existence like dad. But then in first grade, it happened… Dad was the image character for a major beverage company sponsoring a live broadcast show–and they had this segment where he had to chug their carbonated drink in one go. Dad succeeded flawlessly but then, without even being asked to, he impulsively decided to try chugging a second bottle…and gloriously blew chunks all over the place.”  <br /> <br />“Wow, a huge accident!” <br /> <br />“Normally, yeah. But thanks to the quick thinking of the staff, they cut to commercial right before he started retching so the barfing itself didn’t make it on air. Then when he got home, he was laughing, saying [Haha! Just a few seconds later and I might’ve gone bankrupt from the penalty fee!]…I couldn’t comprehend his thought process at all…” <br /> <br />“Oh damn, quite the daring guy. But even with the close shave, the sponsors must’ve been pissed right?” <br /> <br />“No…it was the opposite.” <br /> <br />“Opposite?” <br /> <br />“Yeah…the commercial that aired after they cut away at the last second was for a travel agency advertising a Singapore tour. And it started with a merlion statue squirting water with its mouth–cutting straight from dad puffing his cheeks to the merlion–the crazy perfect timing caused a huge buzz online as the [Miraculous Scapegoat Incident]…and the Singapore tour plans sold out immediately. That connection also led to dad getting a CM contract with the travel agency, and some synergistic effect that pushed the trendiness of the drink he reversed too, sales exploded–they even sent a letter of gratitude instead of getting mad…it’s just unbelievable.”  <br /> <br />“That’s going too far even for a miracle!” <br /> <br />“Yeah…for a while after that dad was called the Puke God.” <br /> <br />“Oof, that’s kinda harsh. Oh, don’t tell me he got bullied at school for it and that’s why you hate standing out?” <br /> <br />“No, the opposite…everyone looked at me with envious eyes, saying [Youta, your dad is so cool!] [Get his Puke God autograph for me!] And not teasing me, genuinely sparkling eyes…that’s when I realized as a child, I’m not the type who can be happy about this. At a fundamental level, dad and I are different. In reality, dad seemed to think it was super tasty and was ecstatic…”  <br /> <br />“Well, papa does seem kinda unique even among celebrities hmm…” <br /> </p>


<p>“Yeah…but you know, I’ve witnessed dad pull off the same kinda thing countless times after that… Stuff like [Staring contest too strong, made big-shot actor hyperventilate and get hospitalized] or [Hypnotized himself into thinking he’s a cleaning rag and made the TV studio spotless] or [Thought it was fire dancing but he was just playing with matchsticks and an actress]…too many examples to list.” <br /> <br />“I see, the titles alone make it sound like a light novel you don’t even need to read the contents of.”  <br /> <br />…While accurate, it’s best not to say such things. <br /> <br />“With dad gaining attention and praise each time, my heart correspondingly shriveled up. What’s needed to stand in front of people isn’t outstanding talent. It’s the talent to accept standing out.”  <br /> <br />“Nyaha, so it’s about whether you yourself can enjoy it or not.” <br /> <br />“Yeah, having such blindingly strong light so close made me realize early on that I’m a creature of the shadows. In a way he was the perfect anti-role model… But don’t get me wrong, I don’t hate dad’s job or anything. I’m able to live carefree thanks to it, I’m grateful. This is strictly a matter of it being completely unsuited for me personally. After all, the best way to live life is inconspicuously, steadily, and modestly.”  <br /> <br />“I see… I actually like standing out.” <br /> <br />“Well, Corone seems like that kind of person… But my family is not even at the level of ‘somewhat.’ My dad is a given, and my mom, when it comes to media exposure, she’s all for it. My sister, who’s studying abroad, is also that type… She started doing idol-like stuff in between her studies, and she’s already being treated like a local hero… Just hearing about it makes my stomach hurt…” <br /> <br />“Ah, your sister too, huh… Hmm, I think I kind of understand the background of Yō-chan now. Yeah, thanks for sharing.” <br /> <br />“Yeah… Are you satisfied now? It’s about time you left.” <br /> <br />Does Corone not have any sense of caution? Her pajamas are so defenseless… Honestly, it’s hard to know where to look. <br /> <br />“Huh? Why not? Why aren’t you doing anything when such a beautiful girl is in the same room?” <br /> <br />“That’s why I’m not doing anything… We just met today, didn’t we?” <br /> <br />“Wow, you’re so stiff. To get rid of a prude like you, you need some special stimulation… Oh, I know. Let’s call Mom and have her watch us doing something naughty?” <br /> <br />“Are you insane!” <br /> <br />This guy is teasing me even though he has no intention of doing anything… <br /> <br />“Enough with the nonsense. Get out of here already!” <br /> </p>



<p>【Choose ] <br /> <br />① Do perverted things with Corone. <br /> <br />② Do perverted things with the pillow you’re lying on. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“The problem’s not about the fetish level you idiot!”

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>The next morning arrives. <br /> <br />“Hey, tell me what this is.” <br /> <br />Teio Academy Principal Ougami Ai showed me a printed photo.  <br /> <br />“Um, there’s a reason for this–” <br /> <br />“Answer the question. What is this I’m asking you?” <br /> <br />Principal Ougami cut off my words in a tone allowing no protest. <br /> <br />From the edges of that voice, the overwhelming aura of a predator…there was no option not to answer. <br /> <br />“It’s me…posing submissively making a weird face.” <br /> <br />“Pfft…Gahahahaha!”  <br /> <br />Principal Ougami bursts out laughing uncontrollably. <br /> <br />“I expected you’d do something interesting Youta Ootomo, but this exceeds expectations! Superbly twisted! Surpasses my hopes for eccentricity!” <br /> <br />I’d rather not be told that by someone who gets security camera footage printed out just to shove it in the person’s face… <br /> <br />“This is no laughing matter, Principal!”  <br /> <br />A middle-aged man beside him raised his voice.  <br /> <br />“However much eccentric talent Teio gathers, I have no memory of a student causing this much trouble on just the first day.” <br /> <br />The voice belonged to Ryougen Kongouji. <br /> <br />With kanji for a name surpassing even some warlords, but–the beefy build seeming ready to burst out of his high-class suit any moment, dense beard covering his chin and cheeks asserting his presence, and above that a vicious gaze belying any pretense of respectability–this gentleman’s visuals handily surpass even his name.  <br /> <br />Believe it? This muscle dude is the head teacher of Teio!  </p>
<p>“You there, I hear you got into a quarrel with the Houjou Group’s only daughter.” <br /> <br />“Y-Yes, well things happened and what can I say… Ahaha…”  <br /> <br />“Don’t you laugh! This is no laughing matter!” <br /> <br />“Yes sir! S-Sorry!” <br /> <br />Whoa strict… While I got the impression of Principal Ougami being strong, this head teacher Kongouji is just straight scary.  <br /> <br />“It seems you fail to grasp the gravity of your own actions. While the situation appears to have resolved nicely, it could have invited management deterioration for this academy.”  <br /> <br />So the Houjou influence really is major for Teio… <br /> <br />“Now now, don’t be so angry head teacher. It was interesting after all, so that’s fine right?” <br /> <br />“Too naive! That is far too optimistic, Principal! What exactly is your plan if we happen to lose a main domestic sponsor? If they become hostile, we won’t know what hit us!” <br /> <br />“Worry not. I know the Houjou head well, he is not the sort of person to drag petty children’s squabbles into business–and just in case they do pick a fight with me, be they Houjou or whoever, I’ll crush them down.” <br /> <br />No individual can oppose the mighty Houjou…but something about how the Principal says that makes it hard to take as a joke… <br /> <br />“Your way of thinking is too stiff as always, Gengen.”  <br /> <br />“I’ve told you countless times not to call me that!” <br /> <br />“Gahaha, it’s just such an intense name I’m trying to make it a little cuter.”  <br /> <br />“Y-You…!” <br /> <br />“Hm? Did you say something, head teacher?” <br /> <br />“I said don’t call me Gengen, dammit! Look, one day I’ll drag you down from that Principal’s seat!” <br /> <br />Whoa, this dude started spouting something outrageous… <br /> <br />“Gahaha, that ambition remains admirable as ever. I love that part of you, head teacher.”  <br /> <br />“Well I most certainly hate it!” <br /> <br />Seems like a familiar exchange… Well Principal Ougami doesn’t seem the type to surround herself with yes-men, so she probably likes these straightforward folks. <br /> <br />“Even so, I at least trusted your judgement of people but…I have considerable doubts regarding your recent scouting. That noisy and careless girl last week hardly seems suitable talent for Teio.”  <br /> <br />That’s referring to Mihaneya right? She got dragged in directly by the Principal too… <br /> <br />“And in addition this week–” <br /> <br />head teacher Kongouji turned his gaze to me, glaring with a look no teacher should ever give a student.  <br /> <br />“I’ll remember that face Youta Ootomo! However favored by the Principal you may be, cause any more trouble and I’ll kick you right out of this academy, remember that!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose ] <br /> <br />① Slap Gengen’s butt penpen style.</p>



<p>② Slap Gengen’s butt panpan style. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Those are the same thing! <br /> <br />“U-Um… sir, terribly sorry to be rude but…may I have your permission to do so…? Thank you… Could you please come a little closer to the wall now… Yes, that’s good enough.”  <br /> <br />I straightened my posture and looked directly into head teacher’s eyes. <br /> <br />“I understand it may seem suspicious, but there’s a reason I can’t say… Please, forgive me!” <br /> <br />I then bowed deeply. <br /> <br />“Hmm… I don’t dislike well-mannered individuals. It seems there’s some hidden reason. Very well, I’ll overlook this slight lapse.” <br /> <br />“Th-thank you very much!” <br /> <br />With prior approval, I moved behind head teacher and… <br /> <br />“Oshiri… P-Penpen!” <br /> <br />“Are you mocking me, you bastard?!” <br /> <br />“Guuuuuuuuh!” <br /> <br />My collar was tightly gripped. <br /> <br />“W-wait… Th-this isn’t what I meant!” <br /> <br />“Hitting the principal’s butt is more than just a slight lapse!” <br /> <br />Indeed, you’re right… <br /> <br />“cough… cough…” <br /> <br />After being restrained for several tens of seconds, I finally caught my breath and got down on all fours. <br /> <br />“S-sorry about that…” <br /> <br />“Hmph, you’re truly an inexplicable person. Your usual behavior is quite sensible, yet you keep repeating these spontaneous eccentricities… I can’t quite understand you.” <br /> <br />head teacher, wearing a dubious expression, came closer to me and crouched down. <br /> <br />“So, show me.” <br /> <br />And he stared directly into my face. <br /> <br />“Hmm… In my long career as an educator, I’ve dealt with numerous students. It’s not comparable to Principal Ōgami, but I can generally discern the type of person from their eyes… It seems you are someone with a straightforward heart.” <br /> <br />“V-vice P-Principal…” <br /> <br />He’s treating me with such sincerity, even after I did something so rude… What a role model for educators… <br /> <br />“Seems like you’re burdened with some troublesome worries. Well, in life, everyone encounters walls from time to time. When that happens, don’t hesitate to consult with us, your seniors in life.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose: ] <br /> <br />① Give Kōngōji a wall slam.  <br /> <br />② Give Kōngōji a chin flick. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Who the hell even needs this option? <br /> <br />“What’s wrong? Your complexion suddenly got worse.” <br /> <br />“W-well, Principal… I’m sorry for interrupting our conversation, but could you please stand up for a moment…? Thank you… And then, if you could get a bit closer to the wall…” <br /> <br />“The wall? Is this okay?” <br /> <br />“Yes, that’s fine.” <br /> <br />Dooon! <br /> <br />“What’s with you? When I see you up close, you have such beautiful eyes… Or should I say, they’re a bit cloudy…” <br /> <br />“Are you trying to pick a fight, you bastard?!” <br /> <br />“Guuuuuuuh!” <br /> <br />Oh no! I ended up saying exactly what I saw! <br /> <br />“St-stop… Are you guys trying to make me laugh to death…” <br /> <br />As I was being squeezed even harder than before, Principal Ōgami was shaking uncontrollably. <br /> <br />“Good for you, GenGen. Being teased by students is a sign of a good teacher.” <br /> <br />“Shut up!” <br /> <br />“Kuhaha, I never expected you to be treated like a young girl. You really know how to handle women.” <br /> <br />“Shut up!” <br /> <br />“Noisy! While I scout students, the real problem is you, kid! Your inexplicable actions since transferring here… What exactly do you want to achieve in this academy, you rascal?” <br /> <br />“Um… I… I just want to live a quiet, unobtrusive life…” <br /> <br />“Can you believe this!” <br /> <br />………… I know, right?

After that awful morning event, HR began.  <br /> <br />“Heeey, I’m the exchange student Corone nice to meetcha! Let’s all be frieeends~” <br /> <br />No way…she seriously transferred huh… <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“C-Cute…”<br />“Wh-What’re these visuals…too strong…”<br />“Proportions perfect too, this goes past jealousy…”<br />“Th-Think she could take a run at the Ten Sai…?”<br />“Idiot, no way looks alone can get you in.”<br />“But if the school accepted an exchange student, means she’s got some kinda talent right?”<br />“For real…? Then she’d be crazy strong.”<br />“Like she’s from another world…” <br /> </p>


<p>Well that reaction’s expected. Obviously an aura that’s out-of-this-world, another world is accurate in a sense. Though in her case, not human but angel.  <br /> <br />“Yeah yeah! Corone, exchange students do a homestay with someone right? Which family are you with?” <br /> <br />Ugh…that question was inevitable… This is bad… If it gets out I’m living under the same roof as this bundle of topics, attention on me is unavoidable.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://gadgetizedpanda.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/00004-1.jpeg" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>Please, Corone, give an innocuous response somehow . <br /> <br />“I pretended to be Youta’s little sister and slept together in his room!”  <br /> <br />“Nothing about that is innocuous!” <br /> </p>



<p>“Ehhhhhh!?”<br />“Y-You slept together?!”<br />“That’s unforgivable…thought he was decent…”<br />“And what’s this about his sister…?”<br />“So he really was just a perv…?” <br /> </p>



<p>“W-Wait, it’s not like that, a misunderstanding! There’s nothing between me and Corone. I–” <br /> </p>



<p>[ Choose ] <br /> <br />① Proclaim you’re only interested in Hiratsuka Raichō.  <br /> <br />② Proclaim you’re only interested in Ono no Imoko. <br /> </p>



<p>There it is! <br /> <br />And Ono no Imoko is a freaking dude! <br /> <br />Why’s it been nothing but history prominent figure getting me aroused since yesterday!  <br /> <br />What do I do…? What do I do…? <br /> <br />Well, not that I’m denying same sex relationships, but…that’s not me, better avoid unnecessary misunderstandings.  <br /> <br />Which means… <br /> </p>



<p>“L-Listen everyone! I–I’m only interested in Hiratsuka Raichō!” <br /> </p>



<p>” ” ” ” ” ” ” Oh…… ” ” ” ” ” ” ” <br /> </p>



<p>“Don’t unanimously accept that!” <br /> <br />Well I did kiss the wall shouting her name yesterday… <br /> <br />“Nyahaha, so very naive. It’s true we’re homestaying together but Youta hasn’t done anything indecent to me kay~” <br /> <br />Most of the guys in class seemed profoundly relieved by Corone’s statement. <br /> <br />“Buuut, he did grab and grope a body pillow while imagining it was boobs, yeah.”  <br /> <br />“You devil!” <br /> <br />“I’m an angeeel~” <br /> </p>



<p>After that hellish HR ended, a crowd formed around Corone’s desk bombarding her with questions. She better not start spouting more unnecessary stuff… <br /> <br />As I worried about that, someone poked my shoulder chomp chomp.  <br /> <br />“Dai-chan, Dai-chan.”  <br /> <br />“Hm? Oh Mihaneya. What’s up?” <br /> <br />“Whaddya mean what’s up, what’s up with her!? What’s with that person subtracting Fujiko’s sex appeal from Nabe’s cuteness!?”  <br /> <br />You’d normally divide by two, not subtract… Subtracting just gets you back to nothing… </p>

<p>“This is trouble… At this rate my position as the class’s popularity queen will be usurped.” <br /> <br />“Huh? You’re not remotely popular so why’s it matter to you?” <br /> <br />“Please stop giving such blunt responses in that deadpan way! I have a future you know!” <br /> <br />“Oh, my bad. It just slipped out.” <br /> <br />“Urgh! I feel extraordinary danger from that Corone. An obstacle surely blocking my road to superstar. Kukuku, I must eliminate her promptly.”  <br /> <br />Mihaneya makes a smile like a mob character in chapter one about to get owned. <br /> <br />“Eliminate…? What exactly are you gonna do?” <br /> <br />“Fufun, for starters, this morning I got in a fight with mom, so as revenge I’ll force the bitter green peppers she spitefully put in my lunch, into Corone’s lunch.” <br /> <br />That’s way too petty a harassment… <br /> </p>



<p>“Ah, but we should properly eat that ourselves and say ‘Sorry, mom’ so let’s not do that.” <br /> <br />What a good kid.  <br /> <br />“What is it, Dai-chan? You’re looking at me like ‘You’re just bluffing, you can’t actually do anything.'”  <br /> <br />That’s creepily word-for-word accurate. <br /> <br />“D-Don’t make fun of me! I’ll show you just how nasty I can be… Let’s see… Oh, I know! I’ll soak some rags in milk and stuff them in her shoe locker… Kukuku, that’ll make her not want to come to school…” <br /> <br />Oho, that’s surprisingly devious for Mihaneya. <br /> <br />“Ah, but wasting drinks is bad so I’ll just leave a small probiotic drink next to her shoes.” <br /> <br />Quite the grandma-like consideration there.  <br /> <br />“But the most direct and easiest to understand would be facing her directly. I’ll go confront Corone and make her cry, so just watch! …Coroneee, I need to talk to youuu!” <br /> <br />Somehow this feels like the same flow as with Houjou yesterday… <br /> <br />Well since it’s easygoing Corone, there’s no chance Mihaneya would get made to cry or anyth– <br /> <br />“Sniff…uwaah…” <br /> <br />“What the heck happened!?” <br /> <br />“I-It’s just…when I said let’s compete to see who can make the other cry first…Co-Corone started reciting ‘Gon the Fox’ and it was so sad…totally unfair…”  <br /> <br />Don’t bawl from a kids’ book recital in high school… <br /> <br />“Nyahaha, too bad Mihaneya.”  <br /> <br />Corone pops out from the crowd and comes over looking amused. <br /> <br />“Uu…meanie. Just you watch…I’ll make you bawl one day…” <br /> <br />“There there, no crying. Here, have some candy.” <br /> <br />“Woow, thank you!” <br /> <br />Mihaneya’s expression changes in an instant. <br /> <br />“Man, you’re too easy…” <br /> <br />“Fufun, it seems Corone is quite a good person after all, so I’ll refrain from making her a target for now.”  <br /> <br />“I dunno what’s going on but thanks I guesss~” <br /> <br />In high spirits, Mihaneya triumphantly holds up her index finger. <br /> <br />“Even if Corone-san is considered an amazing talent, she’s still a newcomer. To quickly rise to stardom, there are others we need to defeat. Daikyō-san, would you mind joining me during lunch break?” <br /> <br />And she declared it with a triumphant look on her face. <br /> <br />“Today, I will conquer one of the corners of Ten Sai —Awayuki Tera-san.”

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Awayuki Tera.  <br /> <br />That name rang a bell somehow. <br /> <br />Unrelated to being one of The Teio Ten Sai, I felt like I’d heard it somewhere before… Well, makes sense a high schooler of top-class talent nationally might get media coverage or something… <br /> <br />“We’re here, Dai-chan. Crouch down a bit please.” <br /> <br />While lost in thought, seems we’d arrived around class 2-7. <br /> <br />“That’s not enough. Lower…even lower…”  <br /> <br />“Why’re we sneaking peeks like this… I don’t wanna do this weird stuff…” <br /> <br />“Fufun, don’t you get it? If we’re caught scouting, it’ll seem petty. I wanna knock her down coolly like [Huh? Didn’t even know about you] y’know.”  <br /> <br />Damn petty… <br /> <br />Crouching with Mihaneya in the hall, I stick just my face out the window to peek into the classroom. <br /> <br />“There, that one. Sitting by the window with silvery hair.” <br /> <br />Following Mihaneya’s lead, I looked and– <br /> <br />“–!?” </p>

<p>I was at a loss for words. <br /> <br />It was as shocking as when I first saw Corone.  <br /> <br />I felt her looks were unnaturally beautiful…same as back then.  <br /> <br />But the direction was decisively different.  <br /> <br />From Corone I sensed an otherworldly divinity, an aura brimming with vigor and radiance. <br /> <br />In contrast, I felt no [life] whatsoever from this Awayuki. <br /> <br />Skin so pale it seems ill. Eyes gazing somewhere far away. An expression devoid of any emotion. <br /> <br />It’s not just cold.  <br /> <br />If I had to sum it up in one word, [empty]… There was absolutely no dynamic information coming from her. <br /> <br />Is she even human…? …Sorry, but that was my honest first impression.  <br /> <br />“Wow, so that’s one of The Teio Ten Sai… I can tell at a glance she’s on a different level.” <br /> <br />“Fufufu, indeed indeed.” <br /> <br />For some reason Mihaneya puffs her chest proudly. <br /> <br />“Why’re you acting all smug…” <br /> <br />“Fufu, one mustn’t begrudge praising their rival.” <br /> <br />Ugh… The hell… <br /> <br />“So…what exactly is that girl talented at?” <br /> <br />“Ah, well you see…Tera doesn’t actually have any specific talents.” <br /> <br />“What? Huh?” <br /> <br />That was a surprising response from Mihaneya. <br /> <br />One of The Teio Ten Sai has no talent…? <br /> <br />“Well, it’ll be faster to show you rather than explain… Oh, seems some friends are going over to Tera.” <br /> <br />“Tera, let’s eat lunch together!” <br /> <br />As Mihaneya said, a trio of girls called out to Tera, and the moment she nodded they combined four desks together. Then after everyone opened their bentos, one of the three suggests to Tera: <br /> <br />“Oh, your bento has an egg roll too! Can we trade for mine if you want?” <br /> <br />“Sure.”  <br /> <br />Tera answers expressionlessly and straightforwardly, contrasting with the other girl’s excitement as she holds out her egg roll. <br /> <br />“Hehe, I actually made this myself y’know. I added a secret miso flavor. I have a little trick with cooking them too, it’s one of my confident dishes!” <br /> <br />“What a coincidence, Tanaka. I also happened to make egg rolls myself today.”  <br /> <br />“Ooh, I’m super excited for Tera’s homemade cooking!” <br /> <br />The one seemingly named Tanaka happily pops Tera’s homemade egg roll in her mouth.  <br /> <br />“Itadakima–” <br /> <br />But her expression changes immediately after. <br /> <br />“Wh…at…” <br /> <br />Stunned, Tanaka sits there eyes wide open. <br /> <br />Did it…taste that bad? <br /> <br />Shaking unsteadily, Tanaka grabs her head.  <br /> <br />“Ah…strange? Compared to this…somehow the egg roll I made feels like it’s on a completely different…no, it might not even be considered food… Oh I see, maybe I accidentally used crap instead of miso…” <br /> <br />She’s saying something outrageous! <br /> <br />“It’s delicious…unbelievably delicious…freaking delicious… And I might’ve used crap in my egg roll…” <br /> <br />No way! And your reaction to lost confidence is way too unique! <br /> <br />“Ah, but it’s so delicious I don’t even care…I’m so glad to be Tera’s friend!” <br /> <br />C’mon, she’s seriously tearing up a bit… To think it moves someone’s heart this much over a single egg roll…  <br /> <br />I see, so Tera’s talent is cooking– <br /> <br />“Noooo!” <br /> <br />A sudden scream echoes through the classroom then.  <br /> <br />It came from the girl sitting next to the egg roll girl Tanaka. <br /> <br />“W-What’s wrong, Kondo?” <br /> <br />Looking puzzled, Tanaka asks the girl called Kondo, who starts speaking hesitantly. <br /> <br />“Um…it’s a bit embarrassing but…the bento alone wasn’t enough so I bought some bread from the school store too. But our school store is total chaos, a warzone, so maybe oba-chan didn’t hear my order right… I’m sure I asked for a brioche but when I opened the bag, there was a male anglerfish inside!”  <br /> <br />What kind of school store sells crap like that! <br /> <br />“W-What do I do…I really really…can’t eat male anglerfish no matter what… If it were female I could but…” <br /> <br />What a weird fixation! Not even Kyoto Sea Origins Mountain Resort makes weird rules like that! <br /> <br />“Ahh…what do I do. The sashimi pack hasn’t been opened yet so I could probably return it, but store policy says only 5 minutes for live goods returns… Checking the receipt timestamp…just 30 seconds left…no way I can make it in time!” <br /> <br />Clutching her head over baffling made-up rules, a hand plops down on the anglerfish girl Kondo’s shoulder.  <br /> <br />“Leave it to me.” <br /> <br />The moment she said that, the girl standing up– <br /> <br />Whoosh! <br /> <br />“Huh…?” <br /> <br />Blew past Mihaneya and I peeping from the hall like the wind.  <br /> <br />Di-Did she just run by…that was Tera right? <br /> <br />Before I can fully grasp her insane speed–  <br /> <br />Zoooooom! <br /> <br />The Tera Bullet doing a magnificent cornering maneuver to return flawlessly to the classroom. <br /> <br />Wh…at! <br /> <br />“Made it…in time for the exchange.” <br /> <br />“Oh…thank you…thank you so much, Tera!” <br /> <br />Deeply moved, Kondo chomps down on the handed brioche.  <br /> <br />“Wh-What was that freakish running just now…?” <br /> <br />Forget the speed itself, her form was flawless. <br /> <br />Well I’m a total amateur so I can’t say if it was truly perfect, but her arm movements, leg lifts, everything seemed comparable to the athletes you see at the Olympics.  <br /> <br />What’s going on…? If it’s not cooking, is Tera’s talent sprinting– <br /> <br />“No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no! ” <br /> <br />What is it this time… </p>

<p>“What’s wrong, Takahashi?” <br /> <br />The anglerfish girl Kondo asks the last of the trio… Can this group please just have a calm meal already… <br /> <br />“Th-The special advisor sensei…also a renowned calligrapher,Kitaoya Jigiyo-sensei…did some calligraphy for our calligraphy club but there’s a serious mistake…” <br /> <br />Why’s she inspecting it during lunch… <br /> <br />“What kind of mistake?” <br /> <br />“A…an extra dot…” <br /> <br />Calligraphy girl Takahashi says in a trembling voice, holding up a sheet of paper high. <br /> </p>



<p>[Shounen yo, tai shi wo idake] <br /> <br />[Boy, embrace your ambition!] <br /> </p>



<p>It’s kinda gotten a BL vibe! <br /> <br />“Wh-why would you make such a mistake…” <br /> <br />“Mr. Kitaoya is getting on in years, so a few mistakes are unavoidable, I suppose… Ah, but now we have a mistake!” <br /> <br />Takahashi raised her washi paper again. <br /> <br />Written there was— <br /> </p>



<p>[Fuji Hiroshi] <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“This won’t do… It should have been [Oka Hiroshi]…” <br /> <br />Actually, normally, you wouldn’t choose individual names for this kind of topic… <br /> <br />“W-well, Mr. Kitaoya is quite advanced in age… So it can’t be helped.” <br /> <br />Takahashi had uttered some unsettling words, but she seemed to have corrected it to a more mature expression. <br /> <br />“Ah!” <br /> <br />…It seemed she found the third mistake. <br /> <br />“It’s not enough. …… Now it’s missing something. <br /> <br />“W-what’s wrong? What’s missing?” <br /> <br />“Umm… Originally, it was supposed to be ‘Golden Rule,’ but…” <br /> <br />Golden Rule… I think it meant something like an ‘absolute rule’ or ‘a principle that people absolutely rely on’… It’s an elegant choice, though not unusual as a topic. <br /> <br />However, the three pieces of washi paper that Takahashi raised for the third time read— <br /> </p>



<p>[Kintama]<br />[Gold Balls] <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Is this guy completely senile?! This goes way beyond a simple mistake! <br /> <br />“Ah… The calligraphy club is completely done for… Even though he’s an old man, he’s still a respected and eminent figure. We can’t just throw away what he wrote… I have to display ‘Taishi,’ the blank ‘Hiroshi,’ and ‘Gold Balls’ in the club room… There’s no way new members will join next year!” <br /> <br />…But before that, it might be better for girls not to say ‘gold balls’ loudly. <br /> <br />“Ms. Takahashi, leave it to me.” <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />With trembling shoulders, Takahashi was gently touched on her shoulder by Awayuki. <br /> <br />“Could you lend me your calligraphy tools for a moment?” <br /> <br />“W-well, sure… They’re in my bag…” <br /> <br />“Got it.” <br /> <br />Without hesitation, Awayuki took several tools from Takahashi’s bag and, with practiced hands, quickly ground the ink. Then… <br /> <br />“Young man, follow great ambition.” “Oka ○ Hiroshi” “Golden Rule” <br /> <br />She effortlessly wrote these three pieces of washi paper with graceful, flowing movements. <br /> <br />S-so amazing… <br /> </p>


<p><br />I have no understanding of calligraphy skills, but even to an amateur’s eye, it was clear that these three pieces were unbelievably skilled. There was no waste in any part—precise, refined, and beautiful, yet also creative… They were truly works that could be called art. <br /> <br />However, the most astonishing thing wasn’t just the skill itself. <br /> <br />“Th-this looks exactly like Mr. Kitaoya’s handwriting…” <br /> <br />That’s right. It appeared to be an exact replica of what the special adviser had written. It was so perfect that it seemed as if the person themselves had rewritten the failed work… It was an unnatural level of perfect mimicry. <br /> <br />“It can’t capture Mr. Kitaoya’s soul, but it should be a perfect replica in form. This way, we can display them in the club room without anyone noticing.” <br /> <br />“T-thank you… Thank you so much, Awayuki-san!” <br /> <br />“What’s going on?”<br />“It seems like Awayuki-san has solved the troubles of the ‘noisy trio’.”<br />“Wow, Awayuki-chan can do anything!”<br />“I’ve been saved so many times by her… She’s so amazing that it doesn’t feel like we’re in the same high school.”<br />“Exactly, Teio Ten Sai is amazing!” <br /> <br />While the entire class was getting excited, Awayuki herself maintained her expression as if nothing had happened. <br /> <br />“Hey, what’s with you? What’s not talented about that…?” <br /> <br />I shot a glare at Ohana next to me… Underestimating her is going too far. <br /> <br />“No, Daikyō-san, I said she lacked any specific talent.” <br /> <br />“What are you talking about? She displayed an unbelievable talent in cooking, short-distance running, and calligraphy in just a few minutes, didn’t you?” <br /> <br />“Yes, so I meant that she excel tremendously in everything, not just one specific thing.” <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“Basically, members of [Teio Ten Sai] are all incredibly talented in their own fields. They’re geniuses who unleash tremendous power in their specialties… But Awayuki-san is different. She’s the ultimate all-rounder… She’s perfect in every aspect.” <br /> <br />“All-rounder, huh… But doesn’t that mean she’s a jack of all trades and a master of none?” <br /> <br />“Hmph, Daikyō-san, you just don’t understand…” <br /> <br />…Why is she acting so self-important? <br /> <br />“Awayuki-san’s abilities are beyond that. To put it in simpler terms, she’s like a character with parameters…” <br /> <br />Ohana scribbled something on a piece of memo paper and showed it to me. <br /> <br />Other Ten Sai: C D C E D B D S S <br /> <br />Awayuki Tera: S S S S S S S S <br /> <br />“It’s something like this. By the way, if we talk about standards, SSS is a value that should eventually aim for the world’s pinnacle.” <br /> <br />“Huh?… Wait, aiming for the world’s pinnacle… No, well, if it’s Teio, it might be possible. After all, they have produced world-famous people before.” <br /> <br />Well, it’s crazy to think that there are ten of them… <br /> </p>



<p>“And S would be around top 10 nationally in ability I guess?” <br /> <br />“Top 10 nationally huh. Well compared to the world that’s one thing, but still prett– hold on.  <br /> <br />…………………… Hmm? Wait a minute. <br /> <br />No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, There’s no way. These categories are like intellect, athletic talent, artistic skills etc. right…? And they’re all S?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />There’s a saying about heaven not giving twice, but if this is true then that would be the least of worries. Top nationally across all fields? Having just one world-leading talent seems far less outrageous.  <br /> <br />“But that’s how it actually is, nothing can be done. Especially her academics are unreal, ever since enrolling she’s been first place in every test outside of year rankings. Being number one at the nation’s top school Teio means she’s not just top ten but the very pinnacle.” <br /> <br />Huh…? Smartest in Japan, perfect looks, and unmatched in anything you make her do nationally…? <br /> <br />“No…I’d heard the Ten are amazing but…that’s just absurd… Possessing talent in everything, is that even biologically possible?” <br /> <br />“I heard her brain development is different from normal humans. She’s already contracted with a global neuroscience corporation, and is referred to among top scientists as [A new possibility in human evolution].”  <br /> <br />Wh-What…that’s textbook-worthy level… <br /> <br />“So in summary, among the so-called strongest Ten ever, Tera boasts the number one overall ability.” <br /> <br />In other words the top of the top… <br /> <br />“Why’s someone like that your first target…? You’re not thinking straight Mihaneya.” <br /> <br />“Fufun, isn’t it obvious? If you’re going after someone, it should be the pinnacle. Can’t have people saying stuff like [She was the weakest of the Ten] after beating them down.” <br /> <br />“Who would say stuff like some four heavenly kings…?” <br /> <br />More fundamentally, there’s no chance of Mihaneya defeating a Ten however weak.  <br /> <br />“Fufun, well don’t worry. The truth is, Tera being top of the Ten also makes her the easiest to drag down.” <br /> <br />“Huh? What do you mean?”  <br /> <br />Does she mean with Tera’s Japan-top ability, she only needs to surpass her nationally unlike the other global-level Ten…? No, even if she could exceed one area, Tera’s forte is her overall ability… Mihaneya would have to surpass everything to replace Tera… Still seems like highest difficulty to me… <br /> <br />“Dai-chan, do you know when the Ten members get replaced to begin with?” <br /> <br />“Hm? Oh right, I don’t actually know…” <br /> <br />Despite all that hype, the Principal didn’t teach me anything concrete. And I have zero interest in the Ten myself either, so never looked into it. <br /> <br />“Well there are some patterns but the simplest is fulfilling the ‘Victory Conditions’ set by the Ten members themselves.” <br /> <br />“‘Victory Conditions’?” <br /> <br />“Yes. Students sitting in The Teio Ten Sai seats must set ‘Victory Conditions’ over themselves. Stuff like [Defeating me in one-on-one combat] for example. Of course, doesn’t need to be so direct and dangerous. Even in academics or arts, just [If this happens I’ll cede my Ten Sai seat] – they decide conditions themselves like that. Clearly laying out chances to all students aims to intensify the battle for spots.” <br /> <br />The Principal did say communities without competition have no future…but that system seems flawed to me. </p>

<p> <br />“But isn’t it up to the Ten members themselves to decide that? If like, a martial arts genius set [Defeat me in one-on-one combat] then nobody could achieve it right?” <br /> <br />“That’s mostly the case. But what the Principal seeks are geniuses who can topple geniuses. I heard there was a past case where a Ten Sai who rose in mathematics set the victory condition [Score higher than me in the Math Olympiad] which was easily cleared, resulting in a swap. That new Ten Sai member set the same condition but was in turn replaced by someone else the next year… Stories like that are common supposedly.”  <br /> <br />“Wow…Teio really is nuts…” <br /> <br />“But since they’re proudly setting their specialties, it could be called the fairest in a sense. The Ten Sai have pride too, so almost none set practically impossible victory conditions like [Win 100 rock paper scissors matches against me]… However, Tera’s condition is an irregular one quite different from either.” <br /> <br />“Irregular?” <br /> <br />“Yes. Tera has set a ‘Victory Condition’ completely unrelated to her talents… And it’s a condition that seems designed for me to achieve.”  <br /> <br />Then Mihaneya proudly holds up her index finger. <br /> <br />“That is – [To make Awayuki Tera cry]!” <br /> <br /> <br /> </p>


<p>“Make her cry?” <br /> <br />“Yes. It seems since immediately joining The Teio Ten Sai after enrolling last year, Tera has set [Making her cry] as her ‘Victory Condition’.” <br /> <br />Why set such a weird condition? If you’ve been ranked 1 nationally on practice exams, set it to something safer like [Exceed my total practice exam score]. Or is it extreme confidence that she absolutely won’t cry…? <br /> <br />Certainly Tera gives an impression detached from tears – no, not just sadness [sorrow], but joy, anger, pleasure…I can’t feel any of those at all from her.  <br /> <br />“Still seems incredibly difficult…why do you think she’s easy to drag down?” <br /> <br />“Because I have the talent to move people emotionally!” <br /> <br />“Huh?”  <br /> <br />What?  <br /> <br />Mihaneya and I exchanged puzzled looks. <br /> <br />“…Oh, you mean the talent to make people laugh right?” <br /> <br />“At least say [bring joy]! <br /> <br />Well we only just met yesterday…maybe she does have aspects like that…no way. <br /> <br />“Fufun, it seems the average Dai-chan cannot comprehend this overflowing talent… Just watch, I’ll have her tearing up in one shot.” <br /> <br />“H-Hey, you’re not seriously gonna– ” <br /> <br />“Here I gooo! <br /> <br />Gah, that idiot’s charging ahead thoughtlessly again!  <br /> <br />I should stop her but…following would stand out too, absolutely… Yeah, just leave her. <br /> <br />Though this flow feels familiar again…well no way it happens a third– <br /> </p>



<p>“…Sniff…sniff…” <br /> <br />“She consistently meets expectations in a sense!” <br /> <br />Mihaneya comes back wobbling, face drenched in tears.  <br /> <br />“I-It’s just…she was expressionless but I suddenly made a weird face and…” <br /> <br />What? …… A funny face? <br /> <br />“Ca-Can’t…just remembering makes me…sniff…my stomach hurts…” <br /> <br />Hm? …Hey wait, could this actually be…laughing crying? <br /> <br />“A weird face made your stomach hurt…Tera did that?” <br /> <br />“Uh-huh.” <br /> <br />“Whoa!”  <br /> <br />A sudden voice behind me. <br /> <br />“Oh, Tera san?” <br /> <br />When did she get so close…couldn’t sense her presence at all. <br /> <br />“Yes, I’m Tera Awayuki.” <br /> <br />She spreads both arms in a Y-shape and lifts one leg posing. Basically the Gree pose. <br /> <br />She’s…quite different from what I imagined… <br /> <br />“What’s your name?” <br /> <br />“Ah, I’m…Youta Ootomo but…” <br /> <br />“Ohh…Youta Ootomo-kun…Hmm…Ah!”  <br /> <br />Tera suddenly grabs her face acting pained. <br /> <br />“H-Hey, you alright? Do you have some condition–” <br /> <br />“Pwah, funny face.” <br /> <br />And she makes a weird face. <br /> <br />“Pfft…” <br /> <br />A complete blindside I couldn’t resist. <br /> <br />Pulling every stretchable part of her face as far as possible, a refreshingly exaggerated weird face.  <br /> <br />Yet despite the foolishness, her expression itself was completely deadpan.  <br /> <br />That gap made me crack up. <br /> <br />“Hahaha!” <br /> <br />Seeing me burst out laughing, Tera nodded her head up and down. <br /> <br />“Mm, I’m satisfied.” <br /> <br />Releasing her face, it remains as flawlessly beautiful as ever… Even seeing it myself just seconds ago, it’s unbelievable. <br /> <br />What is this… Just what is this girl Tera Awayuki? <br /> <br />“What’s wrong Ootomo? Staring so hard, do I have a grain of rice stuck on my face?” <br /> <br />“N-No, it’s not that…” <br /> <br />“What’s wrong Ootomo? Staring so hard, did someone draw on my face with poo?” <br /> <br />“You’d notice that yourself!” <br /> <br />No way…for the composed Tera Awayuki to have this kind of playful personality… The gap with her appearance and talents is too much. <br /> <br />But why– <br /> <br />“I like it.” <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />As if reading my questioning mind, Tera voiced the answer. <br /> <br />“Seeing people laugh.” <br /> <br />She continues expressionlessly. <br /> <br />“Seeing people become happy. Best is them laughing finding it funny, but I also like relieved smiles of people’s worries getting resolved. So I help out various people, even if it’s meddling.”  <br /> <br />I see, like resolving her classmates’ troubles earlier… <br /> <br />“Good.” <br /> <br />“Hm?” <br /> <br />“Your face, it’s good.” <br /> <br />At that, Tera suddenly steps forward right in front of me. <br /> <br />“W-Whoa…too close…” <br /> <br />“Staring so hard, what’s up with you?” <br /> <br />“Your face looks like Sanpei from the ? Gyo character with food on his ass.” <br /> <br />“First time I’ve been told that!” <br /> <br />“Kidding.” <br /> <br />Ugh… As someone who’s lived 16 years with a tsukkomi nature, never met someone who can spout such deadpan jokes… <br /> <br />“But really, I thought your face–your smile was good.”  <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“A smile master like me who’s seen countless smiles says so, so no mistake. Yours is quite the smile, Ootomo.” <br /> <br />“R-Really…? Well um, thanks…” <br /> <br />“And this girl too.” <br /> <br />Tera turns her gaze Mihaneya’s way too. <br /> <br />“Sniff! Sniff!” <br /> <br />She’s still laughing…? That weird face must’ve really struck her funny bone. <br /> <br />“Well, showing her my zero-dignity girl version was understandable.”  <br /> <br />“So what you showed me was still held back huh…” <br /> <br />“Yes. A maiden’s embarrassment towards boys. <em>Pout</em>” <br /> <br />Tera acts coy putting both hands on her cheeks but her expression remains ever stoic. <br /> <br />“Phew…I thought my abs might rupture…” <br /> <br />Finally stopping laughing, Mihaneya crosses her arms and scowls.  <br /> <br />“Quite the smart mouth you’ve got Tera… Fufun, so this was a plot to laugh me to death was it… You seem rather frightened of the great Mihaneya Getsuka.” <br /> <br />“My-haneh Gakka-chan…well, can’t judge others with my name but yours is kinda odd huh?” <br /> <br />“Yes! My is bird feathers, haneh wings Ha-neh. Moon is flower so Gekka! I’m called Mitsu–Mihaneya!” <br /> <br />She almost calls herself an idiot… <br /> <br />“Mihaneya-chan… Yeah, still good. I want to see your smile more. Any worries I can help resolve?” <br /> <br />“W-Wait just a minute, my introduction was friendly etiquette but I’ve no intention of chumming with an enemy!” <br /> <br />“Enemy?” <br /> <br />“Fufun, yes. I’m the girl who’ll topple all The Teio Ten Sai, becoming the world’s superstar someday!” <br /> <br />“Oh, how grand.”  <br /> <br />“Fufun, isn’t it? So brace yourself. I’ll make sure to make you cry, my rival–no, let’s be casual since we’re rivals–Tera!” <br /> <br />“Oh, I look forward to it. If you make me cry I’ll gift you the Ten Sai spot right away.” <br /> <br />“Eh…? Right away you say…?” <br /> <br />“What’s with the hesitation? I’ve had my victory condition set to [Making Awayuki Tera cry] the whole time haven’t I?” <br /> <br />“N-No, isn’t that because you’re extremely confident you absolutely won’t cry? You set that condition because it has the highest chance of retaining your Ten seat…” <br /> <br />“Nope. Honestly, I couldn’t care less about The Teio Ten Sai.”  <br /> <br />“Wh…at?” <br /> <br />Mihaneya is stunned, eyes wide. <br /> <br />“Wh-What are you saying…? If you lose your Ten status, you’ll lose all kinds of privileges like Plenary Powers, Right of Assembly, Kisaragi Rights, and more–uhaha guheguhe.” <br /> <br />Don’t know the contents just hearing about them but seems the Ten get some hefty perks.  <br /> <br />And the third one sounds kinda dangerous now that I think about it…should be fine though right…? <br /> <br />“I have zero interest in stuff like that. I purely, simply want to cry – that’s why I set the condition. That’s been my goal in enrolling at Teio. A school gathering talent from across Japan, it may be possible.” <br /> <br />“You enrolled at Teio for that…? But, there are much easier ways without going that far…moving movies or documentary shows and such, plenty of more convenient options exist…” <br /> <br />“No good with normal methods.”  <br /> <br />Tera lightly shakes her head then states plainly, expressionlessly.  <br /> <br />“Because I don’t have emotions.”</p>
