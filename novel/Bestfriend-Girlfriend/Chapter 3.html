<h2>Chapter 3: There’s No Way My Girlfriend Is This Much of a Siscon</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>As the sun slipped beyond the window, the cityscape outside shimmered in the night.</p>



<p>Yet, there was no lingering sweetness in the air, no aura of romance to bask in. With Aria-san gone, the living room fell into a quiet calm, as if the party’s host had departed and left behind a post-celebration hush.</p>



<p>“You seem quite lively with your sister around.”</p>



<p>“If your own sister was getting frisky with your boyfriend while practically naked, wouldn’t you intervene? Or would you prefer me to let it slide?” Yorka’s voice was unusually cold.</p>



<p>Oh, she was genuinely upset. This deep-seated discontent reminded me of the Yorka from before we started dating. Come to think of it, I fell for that initial aloofness, and now it felt nostalgic.</p>



<p>“We weren’t getting frisky! She just pushed me down out of nowhere! Trust me, the last thing I want is to be on bad terms with you.”</p>



<p>“At least you still have some sense left.”</p>



<p>“What did you expect me to do, just act on impulse?” I chuckled, finding the idea absurd.</p>



<p>“—I won’t forgive anyone who lays a hand on my sister.”</p>



<p>Her eyes were dead serious. But her lips… they were smirking.</p>



<p>Even when another girl confessed to me, Yorka never displayed this level of cold anger. It was a stark contrast to her usual impulsiveness.</p>



<p>I caught a glimpse of a side of Yorka I had never seen before. It was clear that her sister, Arisaka Aria, held a significant place in her heart.</p>



<p>“Now, Kisumi, spill it. Why is my sister so chummy with you?” Yorka interrogated me with an icy demeanor.</p>



<p>“Huh? What do you mean? Could you repeat that?” I asked, feeling like I misheard her.</p>



<p>Was it my imagination, or did Yorka’s question sound a bit off?</p>



<p>“Are you not going to answer? Or is there some secret you can’t spill, like something between you and onēchan?” Yorka tilted her head, her long hair partially obscuring her expression.</p>



<p>In movies, this would be the part where giving the wrong answer got you killed.</p>



<p>“Wait a sec. Yorka, you don’t seriously think Aria-san and I are having an affair, do you?” </p>



<p>“Huh?” </p>



<p><em>Please, don’t give me that glare.</em></p>



<p>“Kisumi, you cheating is out of the question. Or are you implying onēchan is so beautiful that—”</p>



<p>“No, never mind! That’s impossible!”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m not worried about that at all.”</p>



<p>After I immediately denied it, Yorka nodded in agreement. Her trust meant a lot to me.</p>



<p>“Besides, I can’t imagine onēchan treating you as a man,” she added confidently. Maybe I should argue back, but I found myself accepting her words without resistance. </p>



<p>Aria-san was in a league of her own, a shining star in the heavens, a superstar you rarely encounter. The kind of person who would only settle for someone with an outstanding, almost ridiculously high standard, not a mere guy like myself.</p>



<p>And the fact that Aria-san was so nonchalant about being half-naked when she woke up was evidence enough that she didn’t think much of me.</p>



<p>“Um, if you’re not suspecting cheating, why are you so mad?”  While I was relieved she didn’t suspect me, I was completely clueless about what’s got Yorka so worked up. I strained my ears and waited for her explanation.</p>



<p>“I’m asking why you have caught my sister’s interest!” Yorka snapped, her tone sharp enough to make me flinch.</p>



<p>“…Wait, that’s what this is about!?”</p>



<p>“Why are you so surprised?” Her mood worsened at my reaction.</p>



<p>“I mean, does she really have an interest in me?” </p>



<p>“Yeah, she does. It’s obvious she’s taken a liking to you.”</p>



<p>My girlfriend was quiet assertive.</p>



<p>“If you’re upset about Aria-san and I being close, I get it. I’d hate it too if my lover was cozying up to someone else.”</p>



<p>“That’s given. But Kisumi, aren’t you being a bit evasive?” </p>



<p>Yorka’s unwavering demeanor made me doubt my own interpretation of the situation.</p>



<p>“Let me clarify something. This is a serious question. Will you listen to it?”</p>



<p>“Well, go on then,” Yorka reluctantly agreed, clearly unimpressed.</p>



<p>“So, Yorka, you’re bothered by the fact that Aria-san seems friendly with me? It bothers you that we seem chummy?” I broke it down as simply as possible.</p>



<p>“I’ve been saying that from the start.”</p>



<p>“Alright, then does it mean you’re jealous of me, Yorka?”</p>



<p>“Stop pointing out every little thing that bothers me. Are you being snide?”</p>



<p>“Um… no…”</p>



<p>I felt deflated by Yorka’s unexpected sister complex.</p>



<p>Basically, she was just upset that her beloved sister was paying attention to someone other than herself. Her affection for her sister burned fiercely. It was quite rare for a high schooler to harbor such pure feelings for their older sibling. It reminded me of my own sister’s straightforwardness.</p>



<p>“Anyway, I won’t allow you to get too friendly with my sister!” Yorka declared firmly, pointing her finger at me.</p>



<p>“Never thought I’d see the day when Yorka’d be jealous of me.”</p>



<p>My girlfriend was clearly displeased with the closeness between Aria-san and me. It was a different kind of confusion from when Aria-san was straddling me just moments ago. How much longer would these beautiful sisters toy with me?</p>



<p>“Because it irks me that onēchan and you are close! Is that so wrong!?” </p>



<p>“Not wrong, just hard to understand.”</p>



<p>“Well, this is a perfect opportunity for me to explain just how special my sister is,” she declared and guided me to the sofa.</p>



<p>With sparkling eyes, Yorka passionately began her discourse about her sister while standing.</p>



<p>“My sister is my idol and my role model! I’ve always wanted to be like her and imitate everything she does. She’s always been the best, beautiful, and effortlessly capable. She’s flawless and has no weaknesses.”</p>



<p>It becomes a sudden shower of compliments. Her ability to praise her sister without a hint of embarrassment was impressive.</p>



<p>“But didn’t you scold her earlier for only wearing underwear?” </p>



<p>“My sister always goes all out, and when she’s exhausted, she becomes like a drained battery. That’s why someone has to step in and help her.”</p>



<p>Ah, it was the classic case of seeing your loved one’s flaws as endearing. I had the same feeling towards Yorka.</p>



<p>“So, do you enjoy taking care of her, including scolding her? Isn’t that tough?” </p>



<p>“Since I like doing chores, I’m actually glad to do them myself.”</p>



<p>“You’re really going above and beyond!”</p>



<p>“I just like things neat and clean,” Yorka said nonchalantly.</p>



<p>I gazed around the spacious living room, where a grand piano was placed there as pristine as a in a school music room. Every nook and cranny was sparkling clean. Even with numerous rooms in the house, it was astonishing how Yorka managed to keep it all tidy by herself.</p>



<p>“I didn’t expect you to take care of that carefree sister of yours so diligently.”</p>



<p>“Hey, you’re not allowed to criticize my sister.”</p>



<p>Yorka rebuked my careless remark. The sister police were on duty here.</p>



<p>“Um, so, specifically, what makes Aria-san so amazing?”</p>



<p>“Don’t you know that already?” Yorka looked at me in disbelief.</p>



<p>“Other than being born earlier than you, I honestly can’t tell much of a difference. Why do you admire her so much?” </p>



<p>To me, both sisters were equally outstanding beauties. The only noticeable difference was their personalities.</p>



<p>“I used to cry a lot when I was little. Since our parents were busy with work, my sister was the only one I could rely on. I’d cry over trivial things, and each time, she’d hug me and comfort me. I hated being apart from her, so we were always together back then.”</p>



<p>“You were so attached to your sister even back then,” I noted, as Yorka nodded shyly.</p>



<p>“When I entered elementary school, my sister stood out so much that I could hear about her even from the lower grades. Every time someone praised her, it felt like I was being praised too. That’s why I started wanting to be like her.”</p>



<p>It wasn’t uncommon for younger siblings to imitate their older ones, especially in the Arisaka household where the two sisters spent a lot of time together. Aria-san naturally became Yorka’s biggest role model.</p>



<p>“I copied everything my sister did. When I was in the upper grades, I volunteered for committees and such.”</p>



<p>“It’s hard to imagine you doing that now.</p>



<p>Yorka chuckled, agreeing with me.</p>



<p>“When I entered middle school, my sister had left behind a legend. You know, just like the straight-A student who gave the teachers a hard time? Well, she was not only academically excellent but also beautiful, popular, and incredibly proactive. She was the center of attention and the talk of the school for all three years.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I can picture it. She’s got that air of mischief about her.”</p>



<p>“If you don’t understand my sister, there’s something wrong with you. You commoners,” Yorka became radical when it came to her sister, almost like a different person.</p>



<p>“Then you must have garnered quite a bit of attention as her little sister.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it felt weird. Everyone seemed to know me, which made me uncomfortable. I kept telling them to praise my sister instead.”</p>



<p>Even as a middle schooler, Yorka already showed glimpses of her dislike to people, though she didn’t seem to realize it herself.</p>



<p>“That must have been a lot of pressure.”</p>



<p>“I realized that my mission in life was to uphold my sister’s legend.”</p>



<p>“You’re practically worshiping her!” </p>



<p><em>She’s on a crusade to spread the gospel of her sister!</em></p>



<p>“For me, my sister is like a Goddess!”</p>



<p>“Yeah, but seeing a goddess roaming around the living room in their underwear kinda diminishes the effect.”</p>



<p>“Exactly! That’s why her indecent appearance should be reserved for my eyes only. And yet, you’re just peeking without permission, Kisumi.” Yorka clicked her tongue in disapproval.</p>



<p>That anger seemed to be the result of possessiveness taken to the extreme. <em>Just how much of a siscon can she be?</em></p>



<p>“So, what happened in middle school?” I prompted before her anger could reignite.</p>



<p>“It was days filled with the bitter taste of being in my sister’s shadow. The more I tried to imitate her, the more upperclassmen and teachers would say, ‘<em>The little sister is more ordinary.’ </em>It infuriated me!” </p>



<p>“Isn’t that more of a compliment, though?”</p>



<p>Yorka’s ability to handle things smoothly and efficiently without causing headaches to teachers would likely make her more appreciated as a model student.</p>



<p>“How so!?” Yorka protested, clearly dissatisfied. </p>



<p>Her intensity might be fueled by her youth, but it was still impressive how passionately she idealized her sister. “…But I used to feel the same way about myself. Compared to my sister, I really wasn’t anything special.”</p>



<p>“You underestimate yourself too much. No one can compete with Aria-san.”</p>



<p>“It took me until around eight grade to realize that. The more I aspired to be like her, the more I hated the distance between us.” </p>



<p>I finally began to understand the path that led to the Yorka of today. “That took quite a while.”</p>



<p>“My sister warned me countless times to stop imitating her.”</p>



<p>“And you kept doing it even though you knew she didn’t like it,” I pointed out.</p>



<p>“Because if I lost sight of my goal, I didn’t know what to do…”</p>



<p>Losing sight of one’s goals could leave a person feeling lost. In Yorka’s case, being directly criticized by her idol must have been quite a shock.</p>



<p>“You can be quite stubborn. I bet that only made her angrier.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Every time I consulted her, I was told off.”</p>



<p>“What happened in the end?” </p>



<p>“My sister was really busy back then, even in high school, so we had less and less time to talk. That’s why, for once, I complained to her about it. I asked her why she couldn’t spend more time with me.”</p>



<p>“That sounds like what a siscon would do. And her response?”</p>



<p>“She said, ‘<em>My time with my boyfriend is important, so it can’t be helped.’</em>”</p>



<p>“Wait, Aria-san has a boyfriend!?” I felt another wave of shock. Who on earth could possibly meet her standards?</p>



<p>“Exactly! I was so shocked that I couldn’t focus on anything. I just thought, ‘<em>Whatever, I don’t care anymore’.</em>”</p>



<p>“The sister who always doted on you chose someone else over you. It must hurt your feelings.”</p>



<p>Prioritizing a romantic partner over family was a very typical teenage behavior.</p>



<p>“Yeah, I bet you would also totally bum out if Ei-chan suddenly showed up with a boyfriend when she’s in high school.”</p>



<p>“That’s, uh… yeah,” I instinctively lowered my gaze. “It would feel unsettling.” </p>



<p>“Right! When you suddenly realize there are parts of your family you don’t know about,  that can mess with your head.”</p>



<p>Yorka seemed to still be grappling with the conflict she faced back then.</p>



<p>“When you’ve idolized and respected your sister so much and then suddenly see a side of her you never knew existed, it’s enough to make you resent everything.”</p>



<p>“And the fact that the person in question is a bit unique and… well, complicated…” Yorka hesitated.</p>



<p>“Wait, is that something we could delve into?”</p>



<p>Her words piqued my curiosity.</p>



<p>“Anyway! Eventually, even classmates who casually approached me became annoying, and I hated being watched without my consent. I finally realized that interacting with people was the source of my stress,” Yorka declared, as if she had made some groundbreaking discovery.</p>



<p>And thus, the Yorka I knew transformed into the mistrusting person she was today.</p>



<p>“Is that why you started avoiding social interactions even in high school?” </p>



<p>“Yeah. Until someone started persistently hanging out in the art prep room,” she said, catching my eye. We both burst into laughter.</p>



<p>“Why don’t you sit down, Yorka? Standing and explaining must be tiring.”</p>



<p>“I can’t afford to get too comfortable. This is a critical moment; I might even have to kick you out.”</p>



<p>She was dead serious. She still saw me as a threat.</p>



<p>“Whoa, you’re really serious about this. Just how significant is Aria-san’s existence to you?” </p>



<p>“Also, don’t casually call her ‘Aria-san.’”</p>



<p>Her devotion to her sister even extended to how she was addressed.</p>



<p>“Fine, but I won’t explain my relationship with your sister unless you sit next to me.”</p>



<p>“That’s not fair!” </p>



<p>“Well, I can’t talk unless you’re close,” I tapped the seat beside me and urged her to sit down.</p>



<p>Glancing nervously down the hallway, Yorka finally relented and sat down. Seizing the opportunity, I wrapped my arm around her shoulder.</p>



<p>“W-Wait, this is my house!” Yorka whispered urgently, feeling worried about her sister’s return. </p>



<p>“It’s easier to have a private conversation when we’re closer.”</p>



<p>“But it’s risky in the living room. Who knows when my sister might come back.”</p>



<p>“Should we move to your room then?” </p>



<p>“Well, that’s…”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind.”</p>



<p>“You’re a pervert.”</p>



<p>“We’re just going to talk.”</p>



<p>“Is that really all?” Yorka asked, cautiously looking up at me.</p>



<p>After fidgeting for a moment, she dropped her resistance.</p>



<p>“I’ve said it before, and I’ll say it again. You’re the only girl I love in this world, Arisaka Yorka. I’d never fall for anyone else.”</p>



<p>“Thank you, Kisumi.” Yorka relaxed, her tension melted away as she regained her composure.</p>



<p>“But I never heard about you knowing my sister. Explain in detail. Depending on the situation, I might not let you off the hook.”</p>



<p>With a faint smile, she interrogated me again, her voice chilling my spine.</p>



<p>Facing the intense siscon head-on, I recounted the story. </p>



<p>“Remember when we all went to karaoke just before Golden Week? On the way back, I explained about the Nisshu Juku near the station.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s all thanks to the reliable tutor that you passed the entrance exam for Eisei High.”</p>



<p>“That tutor at the cram school was Aria-san. I just remembered it myself.”</p>



<p>“Normally, you’d notice while you were explaining to me, since our surnames are Arisaka.”</p>



<p>“You have a point there. But it was such a traumatizing experience that my brain might have deleted it from my memory.”</p>



<p>“You should be grateful that my sister taught you.”</p>



<p>“Listen, during exam season, it’s just a monotonous routine of studying. If I hadn’t focused solely on that, I wouldn’t have passed Eisei.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, I wasn’t the type who could excel at studying without putting in the effort. If I didn’t work hard, my grades wouldn’t improve. And with goals far exceeding my abilities, I had to push myself hard, almost to the point of desperation.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kisumi, why did you take the exam for Eisei?” </p>



<p>“Because the school is nearby.”</p>



<p>“I feel like you’re dodging the question.”</p>



<p>“No, really. If I had to commute for three years, I’d prefer it to be nearby. That’s why I endured Aria-san’s Spartan guidance every day, just to pass the exam. Back then, I was so busy keeping up with her demands that I don’t have any particularly fond memories.”</p>



<p>“Hmm… But even though she’s your tutor, you call her by her first name. And my sister calls you ‘Sumi-kun’ so casually.”</p>



<p><em>Scary. Yorka-san, you’re really scary. I can almost feel the flames of jealousy burning.</em></p>



<p>“You should know your own sister well. She’s just naturally frank with everyone. Aria-san and I are simply a tutor and student.”</p>



<p>“But is it really just a coincidence that your girlfriend’s sister was the tutor at your cram school?” she asked, clearly not convinced.</p>



<p>“The impression is totally different from back then, though. The Arisaka Aria I knew wasn’t stunning.”</p>



<p>“Onēchan has always been beautiful!” Yorka retorted, visibly miffed.</p>



<p>Despite being shy in the class, now she was like a little girl throwing a tantrum.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. To your dear sister, I’m just a harmless presence.”</p>



<p>Yorka didn’t resist as I gently ran my fingers through her hair. After a while, my girlfriend suddenly muttered something cute.</p>



<p>“…It kinda bugs me that onēchan met you before me.”</p>



<p>“You’re a bit late. That reaction should come first.”</p>



<p>“Why does it matter? Both of you are important to me,” Yorka lightly tapped me.</p>



<p>“Hey, don’t hit me. It hurts.”</p>



<p>I grabbed her wrist.</p>



<p>“Let go, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>“Nope.”</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>“Because I want to be your number one.”</p>



<p>I leaned closer to her.</p>



<p>“You’ve been my number for so long.”</p>



<p>“I want to feel it more.”</p>



<p>I inched closer to her face.</p>



<p>“What are you going to do?” </p>



<p>“I want to confirm it in a way that doesn’t involve words.”</p>



<p>Slipping my hand that was holding her wrist, I intertwined our fingers and gently squeezed her hand.</p>



<p>“This is embarrassing.”</p>



<p>“Then close your eyes.”</p>



<p>I wrapped my other arm around her slender waist, which had been tensed up.</p>



<p>“It tickles.”</p>



<p>“Just relax,” I reassured her. Her stiff frame slowly relaxed as she leaned into me, syncing her breath with mine.</p>



<p>“I… I’m not sure what to do since it’s my first time.”</p>



<p>“Me neither.”</p>



<p>“Be gentle, okay?” </p>



<p>“Understood.”</p>



<p>With that, Yorka closed her eyes. </p>



<p>Unlike the dream I had this morning, the warmth of her touch was undeniably real. I leaned in, trying to bridge the distance between us—</p>



<p>“Come on, hurry up and kiss already!” </p>



<p>Aria-san’s voice interrupted from behind the door crack.</p>



<p>We froze, and I noticed Aria-san peeking through with a curious glint in her eyes, clearly observing our exchange with interest.</p>



<p>Honestly, someone with that much presence couldn’t hide even if they tried.</p>


<div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/1000010708.png" alt="" /><!--    --></div>


<p>“Aria-san!” </p>



<p>“I couldn’t wait anymore! You guys were taking forever so it just slipped out.”</p>



<p>“Onēchan! How long have you been watching?” Yorka quickly put some distance between us.</p>



<p>“Since the ‘<em>Let go, Kisumi</em>‘ part.”</p>



<p>“Since then!?” </p>



<p>She practically saw everything, up to the brink of kissing. This was embarrassing.</p>



<p>And she even had to mimic Yorka. <em>It was too similar, please don’t do that!</em></p>



<p>“Ugh, you’re taking too long! Stop teasing and just go for it. You’re overthinking it!”</p>



<p>“Why do I have to listen to the person who caused the interruption?” I felt a bit miffed.</p>



<p>Was it normal to want to witness a family member kissing other than at a wedding? Or was it okay for sisters to share such intimate moments openly as part of their ‘girl talk’?</p>



<p>But judging by Yorka’s despairing expression, it didn’t seem like it.</p>



<p>“Fine, fine. Let’s give it another shot! I’ll keep quiet this time, I promise.”</p>



<p>“Don’t watch!” Yorka finally snapped.</p>



<p>“Wow, you can be so demanding in front of your boyfriend,” Aria-san teased. She appeared in denim shorts and a camisole.</p>



<p>“Onēchan, you’re in front of a guy, so pick something less revealing.”</p>



<p>“It’s not negligee, so it’s fine, right?” </p>



<p>“No, absolutely not!”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>Aria-san mentioned she was hungry, so we moved from the living room to the dining area.</p>



<p>Despite only two of them living together, the rectangular table was quite spacious. There were plenty of chairs, making it feel like you could easily host impromptu gatherings.</p>



<p>“…Why do you just naturally sit next to me?”</p>



<p>“It’s easier to chat this way, right?” </p>



<p>When I settled into a random chair, Aria-san sidled up to the one to my right. Not only that, but she scooted her chair even closer, eliminating any semblance of personal space.</p>



<p>“Onēchan, give Kisumi some space,” Yorka, returning from the kitchen with drinks, bread, fruits, and ham, complained after eyeing Aria-san’s seating choice</p>



<p>“But I used to tutor him like this during our extra lessons,” Aria-san retorted. She had no intention of budging from her spot.</p>



<p>Yorka sat on the other side of me, leaving me sandwiched between the two sisters.</p>



<p>“You’re surrounded by beauties, Sumi-kun. When did you become such a ladies’ man?”</p>



<p>“Kisumi, try to keep your distance from onēchan.”</p>



<p>“Does that mean you want him to hug you instead? You’re quite forward.”</p>



<p>“That’s not what I meant!” </p>



<p>The teasing older sister, and the teased little sister.</p>



<p>I found myself in the enviable position of having two beautiful sisters on either side. It should’ve been enjoyable, but one of them was like a beautiful yet terrifying demon queen.</p>



<p>“Here, Sumi-kun, peel this for me,” Aria-san handed me a bright red apple and a fruit knife.</p>



<p>“Do it yourself.”</p>



<p>“I prefer when someone does it for me. Pretty please?”</p>



<p>“I’ll do it, Onēchan.”</p>



<p>The biggest Aria-san fan skillfully peeled the apple. Her movements were fluid and precise, the skin stretched without breaking.</p>



<p>Finally, I brought up the question I had been itching to ask.</p>



<p>“Why the drastic change in appearance for the Dreadful Demon Queen? What’s with the complete makeover? Were you in disguise or something?”</p>



<p>Her second form was like a final boss reveal, completely different from her initial look. Where did that dull-looking cram school teacher disappear to? </p>



<p>I never even noticed the slightest hint of her true beauty hidden beneath the mask that even rivaled Yorka’s.</p>



<p>“When I was a tutor, I just wore regular clothes. Unlike high school, university students don’t have uniforms. And it’s such a hassle to pick out a different outfit every day. Besides, appearance didn’t really matter when I spent all day and night in the lab doing experiments. I couldn’t be bothered with makeup either, so I figured I’d just cover my face with a mask and glasses.”</p>



<p>“Basically, you’re just lazy.”</p>



<p>Regardless of how beautiful she looked now, inside, she was still the same cram school tutor I knew.</p>



<p>“That’s just how it is. But with my beautiful features that resemble Yor-chan and me being Arisaka, wouldn’t it have been obvious that she is my sister?” </p>



<p>“Well, I was too busy studying from the practice books to even glance at your face.”</p>



<p>“Had you been infatuated with me, passing the exam would’ve been impossible. You had no prospects back then but your goals were sky-high.”</p>



<p>Aria-san casually licked the jam off her fingers. </p>



<p>“Oh, the trauma is flooding back. Just remembering that mountain of assignments  makes me shudder.”</p>



<p>“Passing you was a close call.”</p>



<p>Reflecting on my life as Sena Kisumi, I had never studied as intensely as I did back then. I should commended myself for the effort I put in. But if it wasn’t for Aria-san’s guidance, I probably wouldn’t have made it.</p>



<p>“Also, why were you working part-time near the school? Weren’t you already swamped with studies?”</p>



<p>Looking around the spacious apartment, it was hard to imagine Aria-san struggling financially.</p>



<p>“It was just to pass the time until I could see Shizuru-chan.”</p>



<p>Yorka’s shoulder twitched slightly, causing the apple peel in her hand to tear apart.</p>



<p>“Am I being tortured just to kill your time?”</p>



<p>People like Arisaka Aria were what we called a prodigy. </p>



<p>She didn’t fuss over appearances and behaved innocently, yet her mind worked at lightning speed, accurately grasping situations and giving precise instructions.</p>



<p>She instantly understood where I was stumbling with a problem, saw the shortest path for my growth, and offered advice on how to exceed my limits.</p>



<p>But what stood out most was her exceptional skill in motivating people.</p>



<p>Many times, I found myself unwittingly swept up in seemingly casual conversations. With her full praise and subtle provocations, she managed to draw out my drive. I wouldn’t have been able to tackle those countless assignments with just my own determination.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to me, Aria-san’s persuasive words pushed me beyond my limits, and I successfully passed the entrance exam for my top choice, Eisei High.</p>



<p>But like a horse pulling a carriage, after pouring myself into exam preparation, I burned out as soon as the results were announced.</p>



<p>“If it weren’t for my Spartan methods, you wouldn’t have passed, right?”</p>



<p>“In hindsight, I suppose that’s true…”</p>



<p>“You believed in me, and rightfully so. Plus, now you’re dating a beauty like Yor-chan. It’s infuriating how lucky you are.”</p>



<p>Aria-san poked my cheek with her finger.</p>



<p>“Ow, that hurts! Your nails are digging in, my cheek is being gouged!”</p>



<p>“Kisumi, Onēchan, you two are too close! Your interactions are too casual!” Yorka pouted, her cheeks puffed up like mochi.</p>



<p>“Don’t misunderstand. Everything she says is like taking medicine. No matter whether it’s good or bad, it’s demanding and yields great results. If there’s something I don’t like, I have to vent it out on the spot, or my mental health will suffer! It’s definitely not because we’re close! This casual attitude is to maintain a bit of sanity!” </p>



<p>Dealing with a forceful genius like Aria-san could be approached in two main ways: either wholeheartedly devote yourself like Yorka, or, like me, maintain a certain distance to avoid losing sight of yourself.</p>



<p>“I must admit, listening to Sumi-kun’s complaints was rather amusing.”</p>



<p>“Well, since she gave me permission, there’s no problem.”</p>



<p>Living beings adapted to harsh conditions to survive. Similarly, I found myself naturally expressing what I wanted to say to Aria-san so I wouldn’t be overwhelmed by the stress of exams. </p>



<p>Perhaps it was this ability to vent and express my frustration while still trusting in her guidance that helped me push through to the end without giving up.</p>



<p>“But you two are really close.”</p>



<p>“At best, we’re like an impudent older sister and a cheeky little brother, so rest assured,” </p>



<p>“Don’t just assume you’re family with onēchan!”</p>



<p>Oops, that analogy didn’t quite land! </p>



<p>Nevertheless, it had a remarkable effect on the older sister, who witnessed Yorka’s behavior in front of her boyfriend for the first time.</p>



<p>“Yor-chan is totally smitten with Sumi-kun. Are you two like, cuddling in the art prep room after school?” Aria-san teased.</p>



<p>“I-I didn’t say anything to onēchan!”  Yorka practically confessed herself.</p>



<p>Aria-san narrowed her eyes mysteriously and looked in our direction.</p>



<p>“It’s quite a shock to see my adorable little sister falling in love and being swayed by a guy. Is this what they call the rebellious phase?”  Aria-san dramatically collapsed onto the armrest of the sofa.</p>



<p>“…That’s some poor acting skills there, Aria-san.”</p>



<p>“What did you say, you little sister thief!” </p>



<p>“That’s unreasonable!”</p>



<p>Her previously friendly attitude toward her former student seemed to have been an illusion, as her tone suddenly turned harsher.</p>



<p>“You have the nerve to flirt in front of the person who sent a swimsuit photo of Yor-chan. Especially when you didn’t delete them.” </p>



<p>“Ugh. Of all times, why bring that up in front of the person herself?” I cursed Aria-san’s sadistic tendencies under my breath.</p>



<p>During Golden Week, the Arisaka family went on a trip to a tropical island. The exclusive swimsuit photo of Yorka, sent by Aria-san, was neatly stored on my phone.</p>



<p>“Kisumi, you still haven’t deleted them?”</p>



<p>“And what about you, Aria-san? Is it okay for you to snoop around on your sister’s phone like that? And then sending them to her boyfriend via LINE? That’s a clear invasion of privacy,” I countered, trying to deflect Yorka’s anger.</p>



<p>“Oh, come on. You enjoyed it, and I had a fun chat with Yor-chan. It’s a win-win,” Aria-san tried to spin it like some sort of heartwarming tale.</p>



<p>“It wasn’t fun at all! I was furious the whole time!” </p>



<p>“Even my sister’s scolding feels like a blessing to me.” It seemed Yorka’s lectures had no effect on Aria-san. And Aria-san, in her own way, had quite the soft spot for Yorka. What a difficult pair of sisters.</p>



<p>“…I’m surprised you managed to send it without mistaking me.”</p>



<p>I carefully chose my words. Perhaps, we were the ones being deceived by Aria-san.</p>



<p>“Well, your name was at the top of the list, so it was pretty obvious,” Aria-san boasted mischievously, like a child showing off.</p>



<p>Recalling the message attached to the photo, <em>“Be grateful, boyfriend-san, from Yor-chan’s big sis,”</em> I was certain.</p>



<p>“…Aria-san, you knew I was Yorka’s boyfriend all along, didn’t you?” I confronted her like a detective interrogating an unyielding suspect.</p>



<p>“W-what do you mean?” </p>



<p>“At the very least, you must have realized it when you sent the photo. Otherwise, you wouldn’t have sent it.” When I asserted this, Aria-san’s eyes shifted uncomfortably.</p>



<p>“Kisumi, what’s going on?” Yorka, puzzled by her sister’s sudden change, sought an explanation from me.</p>



<p>“Yorka, besides your family, the only contacts on your phone are me and the Sena club members, right?”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>“Out of all the contacts, who do you exchange messages with the most?”</p>



<p>“Of course, it’s you.”</p>



<p>“To send photos and messages, you would need to open our chat thread. If someone were to see our conversation, they’d immediately know we’re dating.”</p>



<p>Yorka’s eyes widened in surprise, realizing the implications. </p>



<p>Until we started dating, Yorka rarely exchanged messages with anyone. Besides, because ‘Sena Kisumi’ was quite an uncommon name, I doubted Aria-san had seen it elsewhere. In other words, she must have been aware from the start that her former student was Yorka’s boyfriend.</p>



<p>Even after knowing this, she had been acting as if it was news to her.</p>



<p>By the way, it was quite embarrassing to have our interactions as a couple being read by others.</p>



<p>“As expected of my former student, I’m impressed by how smart you’ve become.”</p>



<p>“But why go through all this trouble?” </p>



<p>“It’s the complexity of a delicate maiden’s heart. I never imagined my little sister would fall for you.”</p>



<p>“A delicate person wouldn’t resort to sending a bikini photo without permission.”</p>



<p>Most people might overlook Aria-san’s mischievousness because of her beauty, but it didn’t fly with her sister.</p>



<p>“Yeah, Onēchan. That’s hard to believe…” Yorka responded with a tone devoid of emotion, taken aback by her sister’s unwitting invasion of privacy.</p>



<p>As Aria-san hurriedly tried to appease her sister, it was obvious she genuinely cared about her sister’s opinion and wanted to avoid being genuinely disliked.</p>



<p>Despite Yorka’s sour mood, Yorka still decided to cook dinner for her sister, and I took it as my cue to leave for the day.</p>



<p>Aria-san tried to convince me to stay, but Yorka insisted I leave.</p>



<p>When Aria-san saw me off at the door, she left me with a cryptic remark; </p>



<p>“You will see me again sooner than you think.”</p>



<p>“I really have a bad feeling about this.”</p>



<p>As expected, my premonition turned out to be correct.</p>
