<h1>Chapter 3: Idols, Actresses, and Influencers at the Amusement Park</h1>

<p>“Reserved?! It’s the best!!”</p>

<p>As if declaring this place to be the center of the world, the influencer Yuu Shibuya is shouting while recording a video.</p>

<p>“Looking cheerful, Shibuya.”</p>
<p>“You’re wasting calories, are you hungry?”</p>

<p>Actress Leona Kanda, dressed in a school uniform for a study abroad, has a relaxed smile on her face, while former idol Ria Meguro, wearing the same uniform in a more disheveled manner, has a sly smile on her face.</p>

<p>“If you think that kind of aloof attitude is cool, you better change it right away. This study abroad is full of extraordinary experiences! You’ll regret not having fun! Right, Shin?”</p>
<p>“Sure…”</p>

<p>As the camera is pointed at me, I avert my gaze elsewhere.</p>

<p>“Hey, you look all sweaty. What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Oh, don’t worry. It’s just hot.”</p>

<p>…Of course, it’s not just the heat.</p>
<p>This sweat is the result of extreme tension.</p>

<p>First of all, as a student at an all-boys school, going on a date with three girls is already quite a burden.</p>
<p>Moreover, this is Disney Land.</p>
<p>This place boasts the size of approximately 11 Tokyo Domes, making it Japan’s largest amusement park. It can be the gate to success for dates or the gate to hell——it’s a cursed theme park.</p>
<p>There is a rumor that couples who have their first date here will break up.</p>

<p>It is the place where communication skills and compatibility with women are put to the ultimate test.</p>
<p>Maybe that’s why Juujo-san chose this place…</p>

<p>Of course, my task here is not simply to enjoy a carefree date.</p>
<p>I’m here to find a partner whom I can spend my entire life with, without getting divorced as the president of Verite and, ultimately, the top of the Hirakawa Group.</p>
<p>In other words, while on a date, I must identify the partner with whom our interests align.</p>

<p>“Shinichi-kun, do you need a towel?”</p>

<p>A pure white handkerchief was offered to me as I was sweating profusely.</p>
<p>When I looked at the person offering it, Ria was looking up at me with a million-point smile.</p>
<p>As expected of the idol who captivated 100 million people!</p>

<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, your face is red. Are you feeling feverish? ♡”</p>
<p>“Wha…?!?”</p>

<p>With a completely natural gesture, she pressed her forehead against mine, leaving me dumbfounded.</p>
<p>However, Ria herself seemed not to mind such a thing and chuckled.</p>

<p>“Rii doesn’t know if you have a fever or not, Rii’s just as hot as you♡ Hehe.”</p>

<p>My head was already about to boil over, making a kettle-like sound.</p>
<p>My brain sounded alert, thinking that if I were attacked any further, I might get heatstroke.</p>
<p>At that moment——</p>

<p>“Oh, Juujo-san!”</p>

<p>The goddess of salvation, Juujo Kumi, appeared seemingly out of nowhere.</p>
<p>After exchanging greetings, she cleared her throat and coughed.</p>

<p>“Now, without further ado, let me announce the content of today’s challenge here at Disney Land.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been waiting! It must be an exciting challenge, right?”</p>
<p>“I hope it lives up to your expectations.”</p>

<p>Juujo-san smiled a little.</p>

<p>“I wonder what it could be? It would be nice if it were something like ‘The cutest person wins.’ “</p>
<p>“Ahaha, that’s a good confidence. But with that, there wouldn’t be much meaning in coming to Disney, would there?”</p>

<p>Juujo-san cleared her throat with a light cough and announced the challenge’s content.</p>

<p>“Today, the challenge is to see who can generate the most of Shinichi-sama’s happy hormones.”</p>
<p>“Happy hormones…?”</p>

<p>Kanda frowned and tilted her head.</p>

<p>“It’s about the hormones that give a sense of happiness to the human body. It’s said to be three: ‘serotonin,’ which is secreted when you feel at ease and stable, ‘dopamine,’ secreted when you achieve something; and ‘oxytocin,’ which is brought on by connections with others.”</p>
<p>“serotonin, doipamin, oxytocin… No matter how many times I hear it, I don’t think I can remember it.”</p>

<p>Ria furrowed her brow and folded her fingers.</p>

<p>“Anyway, just remember that you need to put Shinichi-sama in a state of happiness. The smartwatches we’re providing all of you are our prototypes, capable of measuring the secretion of happy hormones.”</p>
<p>“Oh, a prototype! No wonder it looks different from what I’ve seen before!”</p>

<p>Yuu exclaimed as she pointed the camera at her own right arm with the smartwatch.</p>

<p>“When the smartwatch given to Shinichi-sama detects the secretion of happy hormones, the person closest to him will receive points corresponding to the amount of secretion. The person who accumulates the most points by 6:00 PM will be the winner and will earn the right to an additional date.”</p>
<p>“The person closest to him means the distance between these smartwatches, right?”</p>

<p>Kanda asked, and Juujo-san nodded, saying, [Exactly.]</p>

<p>“So, does that mean the person standing on his left is at an advantage because Shinichi-kun has the smartwatch on his left arm? It feels a bit weird that the score would change based on whether you’re on the right or left.”</p>

<p>Ria said as she clung to my left arm.</p>
<p>My heart didn’t seem to get used to this soft feeling at all.</p>

<p>“To prevent such unintended discrepancies, we will consider anything within 1 meter from Shinichi-sama’s smartwatch as the same distance. If two or three people are within the same distance when the happy hormones are secreted, the points will be distributed equally among those two or three people.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? But then, being close to Shinichi-kun all the time is the most advantageous, right? ♡”</p>
<p>“Generally, that’s the trend, but there’s one point to note.”</p>

<p>Juujo-san raised her index finger.</p>

<p>“When stress hormones are secreted, negative points will be given to the person who was closest.”</p>
<p>“Sutoresu horumon… what’s that?”</p>
<p>“If you do something unpleasant to Shin, you’ll lose points. It’s reasonable. For example, if Ria were to say,『It’s a service, you know ♡』and lick Shin’s eyeball, you would lose points due to stress.”</p>
<p>“Yuu-chan, you have quite an imagination! Rii wouldn’t do something like that, okay!?”</p>
<p>“I wonder?”</p>

<p>Yuu grinned, and Ria puffed her cheeks in annoyance.</p>
<p>What do you even mean by eyeballs…?</p>

<p>“Now, let’s move on to the task. Around 3 PM, we’ll have a mid-point presentation on the park monitors. As long as you follow the rules we explained earlier, you can do whatever you like.”</p>

<p>While listening to the rule explanation, I was contemplating what I should do on this date.</p>
<p>There are two significant things I need to assess with the first-time encounter group on this date, which are: ‘the authenticity of each person’s intentions’ and ‘whether those intentions will last indefinitely.’</p>

<p>This so-called happy hormone is likely something that is secreted due to temporary excitement or joy.</p>
<p>It might be possible to gauge whether someone is enjoyable to be with or not based on this.</p>
<p>I understand that it is an important aspect for lovers and is somewhat essential for married life too.</p>

<p>However, marriage is not just entertainment. It shouldn’t be solely about temporary enjoyment.</p>
<p>So, while leaving the judgment of whether it’s fun or not to the happy hormones and such that come from my body, I want to focus on getting to know them better as individuals.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>Then, there is one major problem or loophole with this rule…</p>

<p>“I have a suggestion!”</p>

<p>While I was thinking, Yuu raised her hand loudly.</p>

<p>“If we all stick to Shin and follow him around, in the end, we’ll only get the same points, and it will end up in a tie. Isn’t that pointless?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that might be true.”</p>

<p>Kanda responded.</p>

<p>“So, let’s take turns and choose attractions to ride with Shin, just the two of us!”</p>
<p>“That’s fine, but then when it’s not your turn, do you have to wait outside?”</p>
<p>“The other two can ride at the same time, but they should sit at least one meter away from each other or on different rides so that they don’t get points! I want to take videos from behind too. How does that sound?”</p>
<p>“Got it. I agree… Is that okay, Shinichi-kun? ♡”</p>

<p>She tugged at my left arm, making a pulling sound.</p>

<p>They are probably asking me, in a sense, from a fair standpoint, whether there is any possibility of being deceived.</p>

<p>“Well, I guess there’s no problem?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, no problem!”</p>
<p>“I’m fine too.”</p>

<p>Somehow, this unconditional trust tickles me.</p>
<p>Putting that aside, Yuu nods with satisfaction.</p>

<p>“Okay then, let’s draw lots to decide the turn! Come on, each of you picks one!”</p>
<p>Saying that, Yuu takes out three homemade chopsticks with numbers written on them, and each of us grabs one.</p>

<p>“Let’s go! There’s only one king!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that wrong?”</p>

<p>As a result of the draw,</p>

<p>“Rii got number 2.”</p>
<p>“I got number 3.”</p>
<p>“In other words, I’m number one!”</p>
<p>Yuu —&gt; Ria —&gt; Kanda can choose their rides in that order.</p>

<p>First, following Yuu’s wish, we head to [It’s a Minimum World.]</p>
<p>It’s a leisurely attraction where you ride a boat and go around the mini world.</p>

<p>“Yuu-chan, you chose something quite simple, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“That’s unexpected. Well then, have a good time.”</p>

<p>Then, Kanda waves her hand at the entrance.</p>

<p>“Leona, aren’t you going to ride?”</p>
<p>“No. I have a secret plan for my turn.”</p>
<p>“A secret plan…? What is it?”</p>
<p>“Ahaha, if I tell you, it won’t be a secret anymore. Well, Shibuya, have fun. What about you, Meguro?”</p>
<p>“Rii is going! I’ve got to get my money’s worth!”</p>

<p>Idol Ria Meguro, who unexpectedly participates in the attraction for a surprisingly innocent reason, rides alone in a separate boat (in front of us).</p>
<p>After seeing her off, we get on the next boat.</p>

<p>“It’s somehow different from what Rii imagined…”</p>

<p>Ria fades away in front of us while tilting her head.</p>
<p>Yeah, I can see why she’d think that.</p>

<p>“Whoops…”</p>

<p>Once on the small boat, Yuu sets up a small action camera on the front railing. She’s really focused on filming…</p>

<p>“By the way, what kind of videos do you stream, Yuu? Stuff like trying extremely spicy cup noodle or something?”</p>
<p>“So that’s Shin’s image of a YouTuber, huh?… I see, you’ve never watched my videos.”</p>

<p>Yuu explains briefly.</p>

<p>“I take action cameras and selfies of various things I experience and edit them for public consumption. It’s more like documentary-style content, and I do a lot of outdoor shooting.”</p>
<p>“Like everyday scenery?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s extraordinary scenery! My life is full of extraordinary moments! Like skydiving or crawling forward and moving through ducts… Well, I did try the extremely spicy cup noodles. Basically, it’s like being a ‘Non-routine experience-based YouTuber.’.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>Crawling through ducts sounds kind of interesting.</p>

<p>“But why did you choose this attraction, Yuu? It seems pretty laid-back. Something like Jet Coaster would be more extraordinary.”</p>

<p>While watching the dolls representing residents of various countries singing outside the boat, I ask the question.</p>

<p>“That’s obvious. It’s because this attraction is the longest.”</p>
<p>“I see… Oh?”</p>

<p>When I look over, right before my eyes, there are large, captivating eyes.</p>
<p>Somehow, there’s a pleasant scent, and I feel lightheaded for a moment, but I hold myself together.</p>
<p>Such a minor temptation shouldn’t apply to me. I must not lose sight of the essence, deceived by allure.</p>

<p>“…is it because the longer the time you can monopolize me, the higher the chance of getting points when happy hormones are released? Or is it because you want to film longer material for your videos?”</p>
<p>“Both of them are just a little bit right.”</p>

<p>Trying to remain composed, I continue the conversation with Yuu.</p>

<p>“I want to know more about what kind of person you are, as you are the Protagonist we’re competing for.”</p>
<p>“I see, that makes sense.”</p>


<p>She probably wants to dispel the viewers’ curiosity about [What kind of guy is he that these beautiful girls are competing for?] It seems like an important aspect for the program.</p>

<p>“So, tell me more. Why did you decide to participate in this study abroad?”</p>
<p>“To become the president of the entire Hirakawa Group, using this wedding business as a stepping stone. To achieve that, I needed to get married.”</p>
<p>“Then why do you want to become the president of the Hirakawa Group?”</p>
<p>“Because…”</p>

<p>I hesitate for a moment, searching for words that might satisfy her expectant gaze.</p>

<p>“I want to become Japan’s top business leader.”</p>
<p>“Japan’s top! You have a great ambition!”</p>

<p>Yuu nods in satisfaction. It seems like I gave a good answer.</p>

<p>In reality, it’s not just about becoming Japan’s top, but rather surpassing my father, who is currently Japan’s top business leader, and achieving a new Japan’s top. </p>
<p>However, explaining that would be complicated, and I doubt she would fully understand the intricacies of my relationship with my father.</p>

<p>“So, through this study abroad, what kind of person do you want to marry?”</p>
<p>“Someone with whom I have a lifetime level of shared interests.”</p>
<p>“Lifetime level? Shared interests? What does that mean?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t know yet.”</p>

<p>While I understand that having shared interests on a lifetime level is important, I honestly don’t fully grasp the meaning myself. </p>
<p>This study abroad is also an opportunity for me to explore and understand that.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“I mean, this might not be something to talk about too much. It wouldn’t be fair to give Yuu hints alone. Shouldn’t we discuss it when everyone is together?”</p>
<p>“Well then, there’s no point in deliberately choosing long attractions!”</p>
<p>“Are you doing it on purpose?”</p>

<p>She’s using the excuse of video filming to extract important information, isn’t she?</p>

<p>“Why not? This is also important for today’s competition. We need to plan our way around the park so that you can enjoy it the most. To do that, we need to know what you like and what you don’t, right?”</p>
<p>“Is that how it works? Aren’t the main attractions of the park usually predetermined?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>

<p>Yuu squints her eyes in exasperation at my words.</p>

<p>“Just because it’s the highlight of this park, should I recommend roller coasters to someone who dislikes thrill rides? Or recommend a Ferris wheel to someone with a fear of heights?”</p>

<p>And then, she points her index finger toward my chest.</p>

<p>“Shinichi is Shinichi, not just an average person. So we can’t decide based on a majority vote what you’ll like. I want to make sure you have the most fun.”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>

<p>Unexpectedly, she spouts such a logical and hospitable statement that it catches me off guard.</p>

<p>“What’s with that surprised look? Did you think of me as just any ordinary cute girl?”</p>
<p>“You admit you’re cute?”</p>
<p>“Of course! I live my life proudly, knowing that I’m cute and cool. Oh, but it’s obvious I’m not just talking about appearances, okay?”</p>
<p>“You mean about your inner self?”</p>
<p>“It’s about how I live my life!”</p>

<p>She proudly and confidently smiles, and it’s true that she is cute and cool.</p>

<p>“So, in order to make you have the best time, can you tell me what you like? Your favorite attractions, favorite foods, and such?”</p>

<p>I admire her determination.</p>

<p>“But still, telling Yuu alone is unfair. Not that I expect you to be pure and innocent, but if that’s your strategy, at least give me something in return… in other words, the benefit I’ll gain from it.”</p>
<p>“That’s true, it might be a bit bothersome…”</p>

<p>Mulling over it, I make a thoughtful expression.</p>
<p>When the usually expressive Yuu puts on a serious face, it reminds me that she’s indeed a beautiful girl.</p>
<p>But that thought doesn’t last long.</p>

<p>She shows a smug and confident expression, with a smirk and a determined look.</p>

<p>“If you tell me——”</p>

<p>After a long pause, she said. </p>

<p>“——I’ll make you happy for the rest of your life!”</p>
<p>“No, not something abstract like that.”</p>

<p>When I immediately deny her proposition, Yuu is genuinely surprised.</p>

<p>“Huh? What’s wrong with that? I’m saying I’ll make you happy!”</p>
<p>“You’re being too vague. Tell me something specific, something that would make me feel it as a benefit.”</p>
<p>“Ugh… What would make Shin happy? Tell me what you find rewarding.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that the same as your first question…?”</p>
<p>“Ugh! Stop making it complicated!”</p>

<p>Yuu holds her head in frustration and shouts.</p>

<p>“I just want something simpler! I want Shin to feel like he made the right choice coming with me! Isn’t that the whole point of this competition?”</p>
<p>“Well… you might be right.”</p>

<p>For at least the three of them, that seems to be the whole point of this competition.</p>

<p>“Okay, that’s enough. If another girl asks, you can also tell them!”</p>

<p>She pulls me closer by the collar.</p>

<p>“Anyway, for now, tell me what you like, Shin!”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“I managed to capture some good footage!  And I’ve figured out Shin’s preferences and how to handle them!”</p>
<p>“Rii was not entertained at all…”</p>

<p>As they grumble, A figure welcomes us at the exit of the attraction.</p>

<p>“Good job, all three of you.”</p>
<p>“K-Kanda, that outfit…!”</p>

<p>The active high school actress was wearing a high school jersey. </p>

<p>“How is it? Do I look good in this?”</p>

<p>Though it’s just a jersey with an orange color and white stripes, it might make an ordinary person look plain, but for Leona Kanda, it suits her perfectly.</p>
<p>It looks divine on her.</p>

<p>“I thought Hirakawa might like it, so I changed in the locker room. What do you think?”</p>
<p>“W-Why would you think I like it?”</p>

<p>Dangerous. I can’t look directly at her.</p>
<p>If my gaze accidentally falls on that bulge she’s lifting up with the thick clothes, the gods will surely notice it in an instant.</p>
<p>As I avert my gaze, Kanda, with her hands clasped behind her back, leans in with a mischievous expression.</p>

<p>“Hirakawa is in an all-boys school, right? I did some studying on human observation and profiling for my acting. So I thought that the boys at an all-boys school would like girls’ gym uniforms the most. Am I wrong?”</p>
<p>“That… you might be right…”</p>

<p>When walking around town, you might see girls in their school uniforms. </p>
<p>However, for boys attending an all-boys school, girls in gym uniforms are an almost mythical and revered existence that they rarely come across.</p>
<p>There might be some boys at co-ed schools who say things like ‘jerseys are plain,’ but they just don’t understand.</p>

<p>“And you like this type of sleeve. Don’t you?”</p>

<p>She showed me her palm, slightly hidden by the sleeve of her jersey.</p>

<p>“M-Moesode!” (萌え袖, Term for sleeves over her hands.)</p>
<p>“Ahaha, it’s somehow satisfying when the results are so visible. If I participate wearing this outfit, I might be one step ahead.”</p>
<p>“Thank you…”</p>
<p>“Ahaha, is it to the point of being grateful?”</p>

<p>With a triumphant smile, Kanda laughs beside us.</p>

<p>“Shin, you, that’s creepy!”</p>

<p>There were two people who were confused.</p>
<p>Gosh, you two really don’t understand.</p>

<p>“Anyway, it’s Rii’s turn next! Leona-chan, don’t do anything unnecessary!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, sorry, sorry. I didn’t expect it to be this effective.”</p>
<p>“Come on, let’s go, you pervert who likes girls’ gym uniforms!”</p>

<p>Ria takes my arm and pouts as she walks away.</p>
<p>And so, with an excited Ria, I rode the roller coaster-style attraction, Big Lightning Mountain.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“Shinichi-kun, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sorry…”</p>

<p>Feeling a bit dizzy from the coaster, I sat on a bench where the air conditioning was working and took a short break.</p>

<p>“Hey, are stress hormones being released?”</p>
<p>“Probably…”</p>
<p>“Right, Rii also thought so…”</p>

<p>Ria frowned.</p>
<p>Of course, choosing the park’s highlight, the roller coaster, had backfired.</p>
<p>Adding negative points at a time that only comes around once for every three rides would surely make one anxious.</p>

<p>“I didn’t know I was bad with roller coasters. Sorry.”</p>
<p>“Shinichi-kun, it’s not your fault, but… What should we do? Well, maybe… ah, never mind…”</p>

<p>While saying that, Ria places her right hand on my left thigh.</p>
<p>Reacting to the unfamiliar sensation, my body involuntarily flinches, [Oh? ♡] and it seems she didn’t miss the expression on my face.</p>
<p>For some reason, she adds her other hand as well and starts massaging my thigh as if giving me a massage.</p>

<p>“H-Hey, Ria…”</p>
<p>“Shinichi-kun, does it feel good? ♡ Are the happy hormones gushing out?”</p>
<p>“N-No…”</p>

<p>Just when I was feeling flustered, Yuu and Kanda’s voices could be heard.</p>

<p>“Hey! I can see the coaster stopped!”</p>
<p>“Oh, were Hirakawa and Meguro having fun right now?”</p>

<p>It seemed that they had come back from the exit.</p>

<p>“Ah, it’s a pity that other people came so quickly, huh? ♡”</p>

<p>Ria quickly removes her hands from me, licking her lips.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Anyway, it’s Leona’s turn next. What do you want to ride?”</p>

<p>Near the exit, Yuu asks Kanda.</p>

<p>“Um, it’s my first time here, so I have no idea which ones are for two people. I’d like to see some kind of performance, and I’d like something cool. Any suggestions, Shibuya?”</p>

<p>For someone who doesn’t know much, I’m surprised she could find the exit of [It’s a Minimal World].</p>

<p>“You ask difficult things…”</p>

<p>Yuu mumbles but then laughs as if she came up with something and recommends it.</p>

<p>“How about ‘Haunted Palace’? The cast’s performance is quite skilled.”</p>
<p>“Skilled cast? Oh, that sounds good. Let’s go with that.”</p>
<p>“You two go ahead. This is a different ride where I can’t film videos, and I need to rehearse where I’ll take him next.”</p>
<p>“Rii will do the same. ♡”</p>

<p>Although Yuu’s mischievous smile and Ria’s good mood seemed suspicious, Kanda didn’t seem to mind, and the two of us ended up going into the Haunted Palace attraction alone.</p>
<p>Since there was no one else in line, we smoothly reached the entrance.</p>
<p>Then a gloomy staff member greeted us with a dark expression.</p>

<p>“Welcome to our palace…”</p>
<p>“By the way, don’t these staff members here look unusually pale? All the staff I met before were full of energy… Oh, I see.”</p>

<p>As I said it myself, it struck me. [hōnteddo (Haunted)] means something like being possessed by ghosts. In other words, this place is…</p>
<p>(TN: It’s hōnteddo paresu (Haunted Palace), so they didn’t notice this was an Obakeyashi (Haunted house))</p>

<p>“I see, so it’s a haunted house.”</p>
<p>“…Indeed, we fell for it.”</p>

<p>In response to those words, Kanda presses her forehead.</p>

<p>“Kanda? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Ah, well… Shibuya tricked me. I mean, haunted houses are about enjoying fear as a form of stress, so it’s unlikely that happy hormones will be released. It might even lead to negative points.”</p>
<p>“True…”</p>
<p>“Hey, Hirakawa. Should we turn back? Actually, I’m not good with haunted houses…”</p>

<p>Kanda started to sweat on her forehead, and her cheeks twitched, and she tried to turn back toward the road we came from.</p>
<p>However, just at that moment, a large wooden door closed with a creaking sound, preventing us from leaving.</p>

<p>“We can’t get out…”</p>
<p>“Welcome, everyone. This is the Haunted Palace… You must be really insane to come all the way to this cursed palace located in such a remote place.”</p>
<p>“We didn’t know it was haunted…!”</p>

<p>Kanda’s speech suddenly becomes childlike.</p>
<p>The gloomy staff member continues with the narration.</p>

<p>“…Then please proceed ahead. …I don’t think we’ll meet again.”</p>

<p>A different door opened, and as we proceeded through it, Kanda squinted her eyes.</p>

<p>“I can’t believe how convincingly they can deliver scary lines with that scary acting… Maybe she should be an actress.”</p>
<p>“Getting Leona Kanda’s seal of approval is quite impressive.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Hirakawa… I know this might be seen as cunning or not really fit my character, but…”</p>

<p>Kanda clutches my left arm with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“…can I do this?”</p>

<p>Even though I know she might be acting, the person in front of me is a nationally beloved beauty.</p>
<p>Her teary-eyed gaze and those lines she delivers somehow manage to move me.</p>

<p>“…Alright, I understand.”</p>

<p>Although it’s quite difficult, I manage to squeeze out those words.</p>

<p>The ‘Haunted Palace,’ despite being called a haunted house, turned out to be an attraction that wasn’t really that scary when we opened the lid.</p>
<p>It’s simply a ride through darkness, and there are various not so scary but cheerful ghosts appear here and there, saying things like ‘Woo!’ or ‘Yoooo!’</p>
<p>Even so, Kanda clings tightly to my left arm.</p>

<p>“Earlier, I was about to say, but isn’t Kanda good at this kind of thing? “</p>
<p>“…that’s not true, I’m not very good at this. Do you know my debut film? It’s called ‘Grudge Girl.'”</p>
<p>“Right, it’s a horror movie.”</p>

<p>Come to think of it, she came into the limelight for playing the role of a girl ghost.</p>

<p>“Yeah. Actually, in that film, there’s a girl who wasn’t in the cast appearing on screen, and you can hear dialogue that wasn’t in the script. She keeps saying, ‘help me…’, and mumbles can also be heard sometimes. It became a bit of a topic because it was real ghostly stuff mixed in on that horror movie. Ever since then, I’ve been scared of ghosts…”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s how it is. By the way, Hirakawa.”</p>
<p>“Hm?”</p>

<p>With a soft sound, my wrist feels a bit lighter.</p>
<p>It seems like she took off the smartwatch.</p>

<p>“Hirakawa, I think this is better. Even if you feel stressed, I don’t think it’s fair for me to get a minus score just because Shibuya set me up, and if Hirakawa sticks close to me and releases happy hormones, it’s like I’m using a kind of seduction tactic, isn’t it also unfair? It should be fine according to the rules, but it’s just not desirable for Hirakawa, right?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…”</p>

<p>I partly agree and think for a moment.</p>
<p>No, wait.</p>

<p>“…let’s not.”</p>

<p>When I shake my head, she says, [Ah, okay.] and puts the smartwatch back on my left wrist.</p>
<p>I think to myself, ‘She’s really obedient to my suggestion,’ and then I realize Kanda’s true intentions.</p>
<p>Darkness and fear. A very specific conditions.</p>

<p>“…As expected of a renowned actress.”</p>

<p>I grab her left wrist in dismay.</p>

<p>“…Ah.”</p>

<p>And in the darkness, I look at her.</p>

<p>“Kanda, let’s make a deal.”</p>

<p> </p>


<p>After that, the three of us take turns riding the attractions.</p>
<p>Among them, Yuu’s coordination was remarkable.</p>
<p>Not just riding the attractions, she guided us and told us the behind-the-scenes stories of each attraction.</p>
<p>She also told us where to stand for the best photos, which seat to avoid getting wet or, conversely, where water would splash on us during the ride.</p>

<p>“Why are you so good at guiding?”</p>

<p>I asked her while the four of us were having a late lunch.</p>

<p>“Because Disney is Japan’s top Instagram-worthy spot, so I’ve been here many times and tried various things each time,”</p>
<p>“Influencers are truly different.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I can’t compete with that level of experience. Both Meguro and I haven’t been here much due to our professions, so we might be at a disadvantage.”</p>
<p>“That’s true… Rii has been here only once for work.”</p>
<p>“Really? What kind of work?”</p>
<p>“I had a job where I danced with Flippy-kun and Finny-chan.”</p>
<p>“What! Ria, you’ve had such an amazing experience!”</p>

<p>Yuu enthusiastically chimed in and seemed a bit envious.</p>

<p>Before the 3 pm midterm presentation, we returned to the main monitor in the park.</p>
<p>Personally, I thought Yuu might be in the first place…</p>
<p>With the three participants watching anxiously, the current points of the three were displayed.</p>

<p>Ria Meguro: 400 points</p>
<p>Leona Kanda: 1200 points</p>
<p>Yuu Shibuya: 1000 points</p>

<p>“Leona-chan is in first place… How did that happen?”</p>
<p>“I’m surprised too. I thought Shibuya would be first… but if that’s the case, what’s the reason…”</p>

<p>I feel pathetic as I hang my head.</p>

<p>“Shinichi-kun, how much do you love jerseys?”</p>
<p>“You said that I was good, but your body is honest…”</p>

<p>I want to retort Yuu, but I can’t argue with it because it’s true.</p>

<p>“…maybe It’s about time.”</p>

<p>Ria mumbles in a low voice</p>

<p>“Meguro?”</p>
<p>“Ah, it’s nothing! It’s Rii’s turn next! I have to make a comeback!”</p>

<p>Ria puts on a smile as if she’s trying to hide her feelings.</p>
<p>At that moment, I discreetly raise my hand and make a suggestion.</p>

<p>“Can we go shopping and use the restroom for a moment?”</p>

<p>I stop by the store to do some shopping and, when I come out of the restroom, I find Kanda waiting there.</p>

<p>“What about Yuu and Ria?”</p>
<p>“Shibuya said, ‘I’m off to choose where the next attraction will be.’ and Meguro said, ‘I’m going to check out where we’re going.’ and then left.”</p>

<p>Kanda mimics the voices and speech of the two, informing me.</p>

<p>“As expected of an actress, you imitate them perfectly…”</p>
<p>“Well, I’ve accumulated experience for a reason.”</p>
<p>“You won’t get anything even if you show off your skills.”</p>

<p>After a few pleasantries, Kanda points towards the entrance and says, ‘The princess has come to pick you up.’</p>
<p>Apparently Ria had returned, then she took my hand and started walking.</p>

<p>“Hey, where are we going?”</p>
<p>“A place no one can’t take you unless it’s Rii.♡”</p>
<p>“Is there such an attraction?”</p>
<p>“Ehehe, it’s not about the attractions. You see, Rii actually knows a way to enter the backstage area. Ria knows a hidden route used by the cast, like Flippy-kun and Finny-chan, which allows them to walk around without being noticed by others. Someone like Rii or Leona-chan walking on the main streets would cause quite a commotion…”</p>
<p>“I see… That’s interesting.”</p>

<p>Actually, I’m genuinely curious now.</p>
<p>By the way, Flippy-kun and Finny-chan refer to the rabbit characters who oversee Disney Land.</p>

<p>“Right here, we enter.♡”</p>

<p>Ria says, pushing aside the unused popcorn wagon made of bricks next to the restroom.</p>

<p>“Hmm?”</p>
<p>“Here’s where it gets exciting.♡”</p>

<p>Ria presses a slightly darker brick in the middle of a seemingly plain wall.</p>

<p>“Oh, wow!?”</p>

<p>For a moment, a narrow gap just enough for one person to slip through opens and then quickly closes.</p>
<p>It seems we have to slide through in that split second.</p>

<p>“So it’s a hidden door?”</p>
<p>“Yes, isn’t it amazing? Well then, Shinichi-kun, go in first.”</p>

<p>I swallow my saliva and push the brick to enter, then Ria follows right after.</p>

<p>“We made it!”</p>

<p>It turns out we’re not in a backstage corridor but rather a dressing room-like space.</p>
<p>Apparently, just on the other side, it serves as the stage.</p>
<p>The door leading to the stage is tightly closed.</p>

<p>In the dressing room, there are a few mirrors surrounded by light bulbs and several chairs.</p>
<p>Then, there was a key placed on the desk.</p>
<p>Looking at the door again, I noticed there was a keyhole. It seems that the door is designed to be locked from the inside using the key.</p>

<p>I see, there was no key on the outside, so after someone entered, they needed to lock it from the inside.</p>
<p>Otherwise, if someone accidentally pressed that brick, they would become aware of this place’s existence.</p>

<p>“As expected, it’s well thought out…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Rii also thinks so♡”</p>
<p>“No, seriously, this is amazing…”</p>

<p>As I expressed my amazement with a foolish look on my face, suddenly, there was a click sound.</p>

<p>“Ria?”</p>


<p>“I’ve trapped you♡”</p>

<p>Ria flashed the key, then put it into her shirt—right between her ample cleavage.</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Shinichi-kun? Do you know how much it costs to talk to Rii for five seconds?♡”</p>

<p>With a suspicious and alluring smile, Ria approached me closely.</p>

<p>“Huh? Five seconds? Why the sudden question?”</p>
<p>“You see, my CD costs 1500 yen♡ and to get one five-second handshake ticket, you have to buy one CD.”</p>

<p>And then, pressing her ample bosom against me, she leaned in, bringing her body close to mine and traced her index finger on my chest.</p>

<p>“Hey, Shinichi-kun?♡”</p>

<p>Ria kept her hand on my chest and stared intently at me from up close.</p>

<p>“Even with skinship, happy hormones are released, right?♡”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, probably… but…”</p>
<p>“So you see…”</p>

<p>My heart races. I can’t control myself.</p>

<p>“Rii will give you, Number 1 idol, Ria Meguro’s first kiss.♡”</p>
<p>“K-kiss?”</p>
<p>“Imagine it, Shinichi-kun.”</p>

<p>Ria places her index finger on her own lips, emphasizing her words.</p>

<p>“The first kiss of Ria Meguro, something that millions of people couldn’t get no matter how much they tried, I’ll give it to you, Shinichi-kun. And if you choose Ria in the end, then who knows what else…♡”</p>
<p>“Why would you do something like that…”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it better for you to know how much value there is in what we’re going to do, Shinichi-kun? Then, more happy hormones will be released.♡”</p>

<p> </p>


<p>With her lips so close, I can feel her breath on my body.</p>

<p>My brain feels like it’s melting.</p>
<p>My sanity is losing its shape, liquefying and becoming gooey in this heat.</p>
<p>Undoubtedly, if I accept this now, my honest body will likely produce a large amount of those so-called happy hormones.</p>
<p>No, perhaps, in the current situation, they are already being produced in large quantities.</p>
<p>But I’m going to stop her.</p>

<p>“…That’s not okay.”</p>

<p>I didn’t come here for something like this.</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>I came here to find a marriage partner.</p>
<p>Someone I can be together with without getting divorced, and now that I have the chance to talk with Ria, whom I couldn’t read the most, the thing I should do is not skinship.</p>

<p>“…Hey, Ria. Now that we’re finally alone, let’s talk.”</p>
<p>“Talk…?”</p>

<p>Ria furrows her brows.</p>

<p>“I really wanted to know. Why do you want to win so badly?”</p>
<p>“I told you it’s because I love you… Why are you asking me such a thing? I came all this way to quit being an idol for you…”</p>
<p>“Right. I don’t understand the real you, Ria. You say you love me, but I don’t understand why you would fall in love with me. We haven’t even met.”</p>
<p>“Even if we haven’t met, there are plenty of boys who are genuinely in love with me without meeting in person.”</p>

<p>Her words hit me, and it felt like my efforts were being brushed aside. This can’t continue like this.</p>
<p>No choice but to change tactics.</p>
<p>With slightly sweaty hands, I gently grasp both her shoulders.</p>
<p>Two seconds of meditation.</p>

<p>“So, Ria, how much do you really love me?”</p>
<p>“How much? A lot, of course.”</p>
<p>“I see. Then, how far would you be willing to give me?”</p>
<p>“How far…? Th-that’s… embarrassing, you know.♡”</p>

<p>I notice the anxiety in Ria’s expression and don’t let it go unnoticed.</p>

<p>“If you truly love me, you would forgive me for something more than a kiss, right? “</p>
<p>“Y-yes, of course♡ …W-wait, more than a kiss… what could that be?”</p>

<p>After hesitating for a moment, I muster up the courage and confess.</p>

<p>“…Touch your chest, or something like that.”</p>
<p>“Haa?”</p>

<p>Ria momentarily looks taken aback but quickly puts on a smile.</p>

<p>“Uh… right now?♡”</p>
<p>“Yeah, now.”</p>

<p>My shoulders are sweaty, and my hands are also quite sweaty.</p>

<p>“Hey, are you okay with this? Come on, here I go.”</p>
<p>“Wait, wait… don’t rush, okay?♡ Uh, take it easy, I want to… I-I want to kiss you!♡”</p>
<p>“I prefer the chest.”</p>
<p>“What? You’re being perverted… You really are a perverted guy…”</p>

<p>She seems repelled.</p>
<p>I can’t blame her; I can’t blame her at all.</p>

<p>“Why? You just told me that you loved me earlier, didn’t you?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes, but…”</p>

<p>Her trembling shoulders convey not sweet tension but genuine fear.</p>
<p>…It’s only natural.</p>

<p>In a way, I’ve cornered her into admitting it.</p>
<p>Gently, I reach out my hand toward her chest.</p>

<p>“Mmm…!”</p>

<p>With a sweet exhale, her body tenses.</p>

<p>“Hey.”</p>

<p>Then, with glistening eyes, she looks at me with a determined expression.</p>

<p>“…If I let you touch, will you choose me till the end?”</p>

<p>…I’m sorry, Ria.</p>
<p>I gather my resolve and thrust my hand into her chest, a I take out the key. I barely touched her!</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>I distance myself from her. No, my heart can’t handle it.</p>

<p>“T-Tell me you’re kidding…!? This can’t be true! Did you lie to get the key? Would anyone do such a thing?”</p>
<p>” ‘Would anyone do such a thing?’ That’s my line!”</p>

<p>Ria Meguro was hugging herself and giving me teary eyes in protest.</p>
<p>It would normally be a quite seductive scene, but that’s not what matters now.</p>

<p>“If Ria doesn’t speak the truth, I’m leaving from here.”</p>
<p>“W-Wait!”</p>

<p>After gently inserting and removing the key into the keyhole, I push the door. But——</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>” ? “</p>

<p>…The door remains completely shut, not budging at all.</p>

<p>“…It won’t open.”</p>
<p>“What…!?”</p>

<p>Ria rushes to the door and tries to push it.</p>

<p>“It really won’t open!?”</p>

<p>Just a moment ago, it was ‘I’ve trapped you♡’.</p>
<p>Despite saying that, Ria ended up trapped.</p>

<p>“Is this a joke?”</p>
<p>“Ugh… the worst.”</p>

<p>An hour passed, and we were still trapped.</p>
<p>After trying to knock on the door and shout, it seemed that the door was quite thick, and our voices couldn’t reach outside.</p>
<p>There were only a few staff members besides me, Ria, Juujo-san, Kanda, and Yuu.</p>
<p>It’s unlikely that the staff would come to such a cramped place during a private rental session.</p>

<p>It seems that the door is designed not to open from the inside.</p>
<p>However, it could be opened from the outside when entering, so if someone outside noticed, they might come to our rescue.</p>
<p>Well, that’s the only thing we can hope for.</p>

<p>“It’s too hot…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, you’re right…”</p>

<p>It’s August now.</p>
<p>The air conditioning must be managed centrally somewhere is turned off, and the unused dressing room turned into a steam bath.</p>

<p>Even Ria, who was acting all tough until a while ago, couldn’t withstand the heat and slumped onto the desk.</p>
<p>Her sweat-drenched shirt and underwear were slightly see-through, so I averted my gaze.</p>

<p>“We might die here like this.”</p>
<p>“No way…”</p>

<p>Even in this emergency situation, the overly cutesy way of speaking at the end doesn’t change. Looking at this, it seems to be a genuine aspect of her true nature.</p>
<p>…though, I must admit that I found her slightly rougher tone somewhat endearing.</p>
<p>Reverse gap moe, I guess.</p>

<p>I took out my smartphone and tapped on the screen, pretending to do something.</p>

<p>“What are you doing? There’s no SIM card, so you can’t contact anyone. Have you gone crazy? Or are you acting stupid?”</p>

<p>I retract my previous statement. I said too much.</p>
<p>Well, I appreciate her straightforwardness in taking this situation seriously.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“I’m writing a farewell letter.”</p>
<p>“A farewell letter?”</p>

<p>I nod.</p>

<p>“If I were to pass away, this farewell letter would hopefully convey the feelings I wanted to express and reach the person I intended to share them with. What about you, Ria? Any words you want to leave behind for someone or any specific person?”</p>
<p>“I mean, should I write one too…?”</p>
<p>“If we manage to escape, you can just delete it. Isn’t it scarier not to leave anything behind?”</p>
<p>“Maybe so… Rii will write one too.”</p>

<p>Once again, Ria obediently starts typing on her phone, which still has no signal.</p>

<p>“What are you going to write? Something like ‘Please forgive me for leaving you behind’?”</p>
<p>“Haa? Why would Rii writes something like that?”</p>

<p>I was truly taken aback by her genuine ‘Haa?’ “</p>

<p>“No, I mean, maybe you want to write that you want your hard-earned money to go only to your real family.”</p>
<p>“Real family…?”</p>
<p>“…Never mind. I just said something strange because of the heat.”</p>

<p>I decided I had said too much and stopped. Then Ria lets out a sigh and falls silent.</p>

<p>“Ria, in that case, using a smartphone won’t do.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>I explain the basics of inheritance and inheritance rights to her.</p>

<p>“What I said earlier was about a simple ‘farewell letter,’ but when it comes to giving instructions for an inheritance, it’s called a ‘will.’ They might sound similar, but they are completely different. A ‘farewell letter’ doesn’t have any legal effect. A ‘will’ needs to be handwritten, meaning it must be written by hand.”</p>
<p>“Oh…! So, if Rii were to pass away now, where would the money she earned go?”</p>
<p>“Well, most likely, it would go to your family.”</p>
<p>“…Family? You mean people I live with?”</p>

<p>Ria’s voice drops by one tone.</p>

<p>“No, it doesn’t matter if you live with them or not. It refers to your biological parents. If you have siblings, it won’t go to them.”</p>
<p>“…that’s impossible.”</p>

<p>Ria spits out coldly.</p>

<p>“What should I do?”</p>
<p>“You need paper, a pen, and a personal seal (inkan). So, we can’t write a will here.”</p>
<p>“It’s the worst…Find a way, please! I don’t even know why I worked so hard as an idol…”</p>

<p>Seeing Ria desperately grasping and shaking my chest, I finally felt like I had touched her true nature.</p>
<p>…If I press here, maybe…</p>

<p>“Well then, I’ll think of a way to write a will, so please tell me more about your situation.”</p>
<p>“You really are willing to help me?”</p>
<p>“Of course.”</p>

<p>…Alright. I mentally celebrate with a fist pump.</p>

<p>“I hope you won’t take it too heavily, but… I don’t have a father. Or rather, he’s no longer around the house. The company he was running went bankrupt and he dissapeared… or rather, evaporated, you could say.”</p>
<p>“…I see.”</p>

<p>I respond as calmly as possible.</p>
<p>I understand that talking about this kind of thing can be burdensome, as I lost my own mother at a young age.</p>
<p>It’s not so much that I don’t want to talk about it, it’s more that I’m afraid that people will feel too much sympathy for what I consider to be a ‘normal’ situation.</p>
<p>Making that decision takes a toll on one’s spirit.</p>

<p>“So, I live with my mom and my little sister, Ayame-chan. My mom started working as a part-time employee to support me and Ayame-chan, and I, on the other hand, thought about how to earn money as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“I see, that’s why you became an idol.”</p>
<p>“That’s how it is.”</p>

<p>Ria continues,</p>

<p>“Well, I mean…Normally, becoming an idol would involve attending training schools and might even cost money, so it’s often the children of wealthy families who become idols. The girls in Haru-Puri were all wealthy kids too. Of course, they were all good kids.”</p>

<p>Haru-Puri is the abbreviation for the idol group ‘Harumeku Pleats’ that Ria was the center of.</p>

<p>“I see. Becoming an idol must have been tough, huh?”</p>
<p>“Rii had this foundation that I received from my mom.”</p>

<p>She says it with neither boastfulness nor seriousness, just calmly stating the fact.</p>
<p>The ‘foundation’ probably refers to Ria’s innate characteristics, not just her looks but also her style, voice, and other inherent qualities.</p>

<p>“Then, all Rii has to do is to make the most of them.”</p>
<p>“But doesn’t that also require a lot of effort?”</p>
<p>“That’s true, but it’s to support my family.”</p>

<p>Ria smiles maturely.</p>
<p>A 15-year-old girl said, ‘To support my family.’</p>

<p>“So, that’s the reason you joined this love study abroad program?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right.”</p>

<p>Ria admits it more easily than I expected.</p>

<p>“Being an idol is unpredictable. You never know how long you can stay active. It’s different from regular jobs with retirement ages still far away, and I might have 40 or 50 more years of not earning anything later. Living for such a long time with the savings I made during my idol days is impossible.”</p>
<p>“However, it’s not like you’ll be completely secure if you’re with me. I might have a big failure in my business. That’s…”</p>

<p>I hesitate a little and eventually say it out loud.</p>

<p>“…like Ria’s father.”</p>
<p>“I know. But that’s not really relevant to me.”</p>
<p>“Not relevant?”</p>

<p>Surprised by her unexpected response, I tilt my head.</p>

<p>“If we get engaged at this timing, I think I can get financial support to go to university. Then, I can learn to live independently.”</p>

<p>With an expression that shows both innocence and intelligence deep within.</p>

<p>“I want to be able to earn money on my own.”</p>
<p>“You’ve thought it through that much?”</p>
<p>“I have. That’s why I want to get engaged while I’m still in high school. On the other hand, if I can’t get engaged now, it feels meaningless… That’s the reason I joined this study abroad program.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>

<p>Ria smiles bitterly and says, ‘Maybe I shouldn’t have said that.’</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you tell me that from the beginning?”</p>
<p>“Would Shinichi-kun choose someone who approached you for money?”</p>

<p>I give her a dry smile, and express my honest thoughts.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong with forming a contractual relationship for money?”</p>
<p>“…huh?”</p>

<p>My answer seems to have genuinely surprised Ria, as she widens her eyes.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“That’s what business is all about, isn’t it? I understand the importance of money because I’m earning my own money to live by myself now because I attend a private high school. I’ve gritted my teeth countless times seeing my classmates who spend money like turning on tap water.”</p>

<p>I continued,</p>

<p>“In my case, it’s true that I had a privileged upbringing and education from birth to middle school. I’m aware that I have a sharp mind, as you put it, I had the ‘foundation.’ I also realize that I’m fighting using that as my weapon. But precisely because of that, I genuinely admire Ria for using everything she can as her weapons and earning money.”</p>
<p>“Really..?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>I nod. This is my true feeling.</p>

<p>“Ria, I thought you were incredibly cool.”</p>
<p>“Shinichi-kun…!”</p>

<p>After calling my name with wide-open eyes, Ria shakes her head as if to brush something off.</p>

<p>“N-No, it’s not like that! It’s not a big deal, really; Rii don’t think much about it. Rii is Japan’s top idol, she’s not that fragile…Th-the thing is, I get called ‘cute’ a lot, but not ‘cool’ very often, so I was just a little surprised…”</p>

<p>She mumbles something incoherent.</p>
<p>No, I’m the one who’s surprised by her unexpected reaction.</p>

<p>“…A-Anyway! Rii wants to make sure Rii’s money doesn’t go towards that man’s debts and instead goes solely to my mom and sister. Can you do that?”</p>
<p>“No, I can’t.”</p>
<p>“Huh!? Then what was all that talk just now!?”</p>

<p>Ria’s expression changes completely, and she widens her eyes in disbelief.</p>

<p>“I told you, right? Without paper, pen, and a seal, you can’t make a will.”</p>
<p>“I told you everything becauseI thought you could figure something out now! The worst…!”</p>

<p>Ria glares at me with teary eyes.</p>

<p>“Well, from the beginning, you don’t need to write a will.”</p>

<p>I stand up quietly.</p>
<p>And with the coolest smile I’ve ever mustered, I tell her.</p>

<p>“Ria, can you get on top of me?”</p>
<p>“Huh!? That’s creepy!”</p>

<p>Too harsh!!</p>
<p>While hurt by her reaction, I offered Ria the lighter I took out from my pocket.</p>

<p>“Do you know how to use a lighter?”</p>
<p>“I know, but why? Are you insane to light a fire in this scorching heat? Did the heat fry your brain? What are you planning? And why do you carry it with you? You’re not a smoker, right? I hate smokers because my supposed father used to smoke.”</p>

<p>Scary-scary, she’s really angry.</p>
<p>Come back! The gentle Ria from a moment ago.</p>

<p>“I’m not a smoker. I’m not even 20 yet. I bought it at the shop earlier, just in case.”</p>
<p>“Just in case what?”</p>
<p>“To be trapped like this.”</p>
<p>“Huh..?”</p>

<p>What I had anticipated was being trapped with Ria, not that Ria would be trapped with me.</p>

<p>“I’m scared because I don’t understand what you’re saying… What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Here, start a fire.”</p>

<p>I point to the ceiling where a fire alarm and sprinkler are installed.</p>

<p>“If a fire happens, someone should be alerted, and rescue should come.”</p>
<p>“I see… you could have told me earlier.”</p>
<p>“I wanted to have a heart-to-heart talk with Ria.”</p>

<p>As I say that with a cool smile again, Ria kicks my shin and tearfully exclaims.</p>

<p>“Rii really needs to go to the bathroom, Rii has been holding back so much!”</p>

<p>Sorry about that…</p>
<p>She then slowly climbs onto my shoulders.</p>

<p>“Oh wow, Shinichi-kun, your head is slippery with sweat!”</p>
<p>“I find your sweaty thighs equally uncomfortable…”</p>
<p>“Huh? Rii’s thigh sweat? Isn’t that a reward? Why don’t you drink it? “</p>
<p>“Hey, Idol…”</p>

<p>Well, technically, a former idol.</p>

<p>“If this doesn’t work, I’ll seriously kill you, you know?”</p>
<p>“If this doesn’t work, we’ll die anyway.”</p>

<p>I wonder how many people in this world would be willing to die while being sandwiched between Ria’s thighs.</p>
<p>But I’m different. Probably?</p>

<p>“Here I go…”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>

<p>Ria lights the lighter and brings it closer to the sprinkler area.</p>
<p>A few seconds later…</p>

<p>Jiriririririri!</p>

<p>With a loud noise, a shower of water pours down from the ceiling.</p>

<p>“Wow, that’s a lot of water! Shinichi-kun, get me down quickly!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure…!”</p>

<p>Ria, who has descended from my shoulders, spreads her arms and takes in the water.</p>

<p>“Hahaha, it feels so great!”</p>
<p>“…Yeah, it does.”</p>

<p>If that smiling face beyond the water spray is fake, it would hurt quite a bit.</p>

<p>“What are you smiling about? It’s your fault, Shinichi-kun.”</p>
<p>“It’s not my fault, definitely not.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s all because of Shinichi-kun that…”</p>

<p>Ria continues with that seemingly innocent smile.</p>

<p>“…I feel a little refreshed now♡”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>Well, I got to see something good too.</p>

<p>“…Oh, Shinichi-kun, what should we do? If I get in the water, I’ll be in trouble.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What?”</p>

<p>When I look at her, she says, ‘I can’t hold it anymore…’ (toilet)</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>I look up at her, and the next thing I know, the door opens.</p>

<p>“Hey, are you okay, Shin? What is this situation?”</p>
<p>“Oh, Hirakawa and Meguro, were you having fun again this time?”</p>
<p>“Excuse me!” (失敬)</p>

<p>Saying that, Ria rushes out, shouting words like a middle-aged man.</p>
<p>I hope she makes it in time.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>As we successfully escape, it’s just about 6:00 PM.</p>
<p>The four of us line up in front of a large monitor.</p>
<p>Juujo-san is with us this time too.</p>

<p>“Everyone, I’m glad you enjoyed yourselves to the fullest.”</p>
<p>“Enjoyed? What’s there to enjoy? Since the interim announcement, I haven’t played with Shin once. Except for that b*tch over there, there’s no change in points, right? “</p>

<p>Yuu says with a very displeased look.</p>

<p>“You called me a b*tch!? Rii is also a victim, you know!”</p>
<p>“Meguro, isn’t that a bit too much?”</p>

<p>Kanda says with a smile, taking a stab at Meguro.</p>

<p>“Now then, let’s make the announcement. First, here are the scores from the interim announcement.”</p>

<p>Ria Meguro: 400 points</p>
<p>Leona Kanda: 1200 points</p>
<p>Yuu Shibuya: 1000 points</p>

<p>The large display shows the points from earlier.</p>

<p>“The question is how many points Ria earned…”</p>
<p>“Now, first of all, let’s announce Ria Meguro’s points.”</p>

<p>Ria clasps her hands together.</p>

<p>“Ria Meguro… 400 points.”</p>
<p>“Huh? It didn’t change!? Why!? Rii, even though Shinichi touched my breasts!?”</p>
<p>“Watch your words!”</p>

<p>I barely touched them!</p>
<p>Ria grabs my wet clothes and shakes me back and forth.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you release happy hormones when you were with Rii? Did you really not like it? Is that even possible?”</p>
<p>“Well, I think the happy hormones were released, probably.”</p>
<p>“Then why…!?”</p>

<p>Standing beside us, Kanda smirks and raises the corner of her mouth.</p>

<p>“That’s right, Meguro.”</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>
<p>“After the interim announcement, Hirakawa and I exchanged our smartwatches.”</p>
<p>“Eh..!! Shinichi-kun, why did you do that!?”</p>
<p>“Well, you see…”</p>

<p>Ria clings onto me, and I cross my arms, making a clear declaration.</p>

<p>“It’s because I’m a real virgin!”</p>
<p>” “…?” “</p>
<p>“Ahahaha…!”</p>

<p>Yuu and Ria are dumbfounded by my declaration, while Kanda wipes the corners of her eyes and bursts into laughter.</p>

<p>“I wanted to know two things during this test. First, who I enjoy being with the most, and second, the true intention behind everyone’s study abroad. However, I was afraid that if someone tried to seduce me, I might lose sight of both goals.”</p>
<p>“I don’t know if it’s cool or lame….”</p>
<p>“And I knew that someone, or rather, Ria, would try to do something like that. It’s the perfect strategy to release happy hormones, and Ria had already tested it at the exit of the Big Lightning Mountain. But I also saw it as a chance to probe Ria’s intentions. So, I asked Kanda to exchange the smartwatches.”</p>

<p>Ignoring Yuu’s interjection, I continue my explanation.</p>

<p>“And why did you choose Leona-chan…?”</p>
<p>“Because I can hide it with my long sleeves. With a regular uniform, the wrists would be exposed, and it would be noticeable.”</p>
<p>“Just for that!?”</p>
<p>“It’s not just that. Kanda had planned to exchange the smartwatches with me initially, and she had set up a strategy where points would only be earned when spending time with her.”</p>
<p>“That’s cheating!”</p>

<p>Ria’s eyes widen. Well, Ria is cheating too.</p>

<p>“I thought of pretending to be scared in the Haunted Palace and clinging to Hirakawa while trying to switch the watches, but he caught on immediately. That’s why I wore a tracksuit, well, It was embarrassing to have to stay in Disney in my jersey all day long.</p>
<p>“But you don’t show it on your face.”</p>
<p>“Because I’m an actress.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that amazing?”</p>

<p>Yuu expresses genuine admiration.</p>
<p>Good grief.</p>

<p>“So, I asked her to stop that strategy and, instead of disqualifying her, I requested her to exchange the smartwatch just once.”</p>
<p>“Wow…”</p>

<p>While Ria seems undecided about whether to be impressed or angry, Yuu raises her hand.</p>

<p>“Does that mean Leona and I are having a fair competition?”</p>
<p>“It should be..”</p>
<p>“So, does that mean there won’t be any changes in the next announcement?”</p>

<p>That is indeed likely. Kanda will probably advance… thanks to the gym clothes effect.</p>

<p>“Can we proceed with the rest of the announcement?”</p>

<p>Juujo-san interjects.</p>

<p>“Leona Kanda…1200 points.”</p>
<p>“See, it’s the same as before. I guess that means Leona’s strategy worked out…”</p>

<p>Yuu shrugs, and Juujo-san speaks again.</p>

<p>“Yuu Shibuya: 1500 points.”</p>
<p>” ” ” ” …. What? ” ” ” “</p>

<p>Yuu, Ria, and I simultaneously tilt our heads in confusion.</p>

<p>“Leona, why? You were holding Hirakawa’s smartwatch, right? The points shouldn’t have changed!”</p>
<p>“Well, you see… Can you listen to my explanation without laughing?”</p>

<p>Kanda smiles and explains.</p>

<p>“I took Hirakawa’s smartwatch from him and kept it. I was supposed to leave it in my bag, but, you know… I was curious about what it would feel like to exchange watches with a boyfriend, so I put it on for a little while.”</p>
<p>“But he’s not your boyfriend, though?”</p>
<p>“I wondered what it would feel like to exchange watches with a boyfriend, so I put it on for a little while,”</p>

<p>Kanda says, repeating the same thing for some reason.</p>

<p>“Then, somehow, I started feeling happy. And then, it seems that the amount of happy hormones I secreted was added to Shibuya, who was closest to me at the time.”</p>

<p>Kanda says while smiling shyly and blushing</p>

<p>“Kanda, that’s…,”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, it’s embarrassing, isn’t it? Oh, here’s your smartwatch. I’ll return it.”</p>

<p>Kanda takes off the smartwatch that she apparently had underneath her tracksuit and hands it back to me.</p>

<p>“Come to think of it, it’s like losing the match but winning the game, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>Ria’s dazzled voice, which seemed to have lost both the match and the game, echoed in the deserted amusement park.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Awesome! All the characters are looking at me!”</p>

<p>Yuu says, waving her hand and filming a video of the parade.</p>
<p>The additional date was to enjoy the parade together just before the park closed.</p>
<p>We had prime seats directly across from the towering Shangri-La Castle in the center of the park, where we could always have the castle as their backdrop during the parade.</p>
<p>Floats decorated with characters and sparkling decorations pass by.</p>

<p>“Shin, by the way, is your hair dry yet?”</p>

<p>When the floats carrying the characters pass by, and only the illumination and music remain, Yuu puts down her camera and asks me.</p>

<p>“Thanks to you, my hair is dry now. Thanks for the sweatshirt, too”</p>
<p>“Of course, I chose it for you.”</p>

<p>I was wearing a sweatshirt set with small character embroideries on a cream-colored fabric.</p>
<p>My uniform got soaking wet from sweat and the sprinklers, so Yuu gave me the sweatshirt as a present, along with a specially designed set of trunks and a towel.</p>
<p>She’s so carefree and self-centered, yet thoughtful—I can’t help but be impressed by her sincere consideration.</p>

<p>Before I knew it, I genuinely wanted to know more about her.</p>

<p>“Why did you decide to become a YouTuber, Yuu?”</p>

<p>Yuu smiles, a little embarrassed, and says, ‘Why all of a sudden?’</p>

<p>“I just want to leave proof that I existed.”</p>
<p>“Huh…”</p>

<p>She says it as if it’s nothing, but isn’t that an incredibly significant—literally, heavy and substantial—piece of information?</p>

<p>“Yuu… do you have plans to die or something?”</p>
<p>“What? Of course I don’t plan to die?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>Not understanding the meaning of the question, she asked me again in a surprised tone.</p>

<p>“Are you asking if I’m immortal or something?”</p>
<p>“No, I’m not, but…”</p>
<p>“Just kidding, I know that.”</p>

<p>Yuu sighs with half-closed eyes.</p>

<p>“When I was in elementary school, I underwent surgery with a 70% success rate. I had a slightly serious illness from birth.”</p>
<p>“Is that so…”</p>
<p>“Shin, have you ever had general anesthesia?”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t.”</p>

<p>I often visited the hospital to see my mother when she was hospitalized, but I myself have always been healthy and haven’t experienced anything like that.</p>

<p>“With general anesthesia, after they insert the IV, they put a mask on your face like an oxygen mask. They tell you to count numbers, like ‘1, 2, 3…’ As you’re counting, the anesthesia takes effect, and when you go silent, they confirm that you’ve lost consciousness.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>Instead of numbers, they might ask you to recite the hiragana characters; that could work too.</p>

<p>“Usually, they say you lose consciousness after counting to 2 or 3. But, for me… I counted to 10 or more. By the time the anesthesia started to work, the doctor seemed to be getting anxious because it wasn’t taking effect, and I finally lost consciousness.”</p>
<p>“Is it because you have a resistance to anesthesia?”</p>
<p>“Probably not.”</p>

<p>Yuu shakes her head.</p>

<p>“At that time, I was desperately trying not to fall asleep. The success rate was 70%, right? In other words, there was a 30% chance that I might never wake up again. When I thought about that, I got scared and wished I had done more things… So, I firmly held on to my consciousness, not letting go.”</p>
<p>“Never wake up again, huh?”</p>

<p>I softly try to imagine it.</p>
<p>Closing your eyes and never waking up again.</p>
<p>A 70% chance of success. But that means a 30% chance of failure.</p>
<p>It’s one thing if it’s a batting average in baseball or a hit rate in a game, but a 70% chance of living or dying is an unsettling probability.</p>

<p>“Well, you don’t have to look so serious, as you can see, I ended up in the 70% group. I’m completely healthy now, both mentally and physically, and the chances of it recurring are almost non-existent.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>Surprisingly, I feel a deep sense of relief.</p>

<p>“But still, not knowing when I’ll die is something that will stay with me from that time on. So, I want to live in a way that I won’t regret at that time. I want to be able to think, ‘Ah, it was a good life.’ To do that, I think I should have as many experiences as possible as soon as possible. Shouldn’t I do everything I want to do?”</p>
<p>“How long do you plan to live?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, it might be until tomorrow. If that’s the case, there’s no such thing as an experience that’s too early, right?”</p>

<p>Finally, I understood the meaning of what Yuu said when we first met.</p>
<p>I see, she must be living every day as if it were her last.</p>

<p>“So, it’s proof of your life. To leave it in someone’s memory.”</p>
<p>“You’re good at reading between the lines! You didn’t say ‘leaving records,’ and that’s what makes it interesting.”</p>

<p>Yuu smiles happily. Well, I’ve lost my mother too.</p>

<p>“Yeah, memories. Records will end when they can’t be seen anymore, but as long as people who watched my videos hold memories of me, I’ll continue to live on! Besides, there might be someone who takes action because of my videos. And in the results of their actions, I’ll continue to live on.”</p>

<p>She looked at me with sparkling eyes, contrary to her words.</p>

<p>“Isn’t that amazing? That’s why I want to influence as many people as possible! I want them to see the scenery I’ve seen! That’s why I became a YouTuber.”</p>

<p>As the parade passed by and fireworks lit up the sky, she continued speaking.</p>

<p>“I love fireworks. Not just these fireworks, but I especially love the ones at town festivals.”</p>

<p>Her eyes reflected the brilliant and dazzling lights that spread and scattered.</p>

<p>“Fireworks disappear in an instant. But the high school student from that town might invite someone to the fireworks festival and end up marrying them. The young couple who set up a food stall at the festival might use the money they earn for a honeymoon they’ll cherish for a lifetime. A child who came with their parents to watch the fireworks might become a pyrotechnician because they want to give others the same excitement. In that way, even the fireworks that have long vanished continue to live on by influencing various people. That’s what it means to exist.”</p>

<p>With the instant shimmer reflected in her large eyes, she said firmly, ‘That’s the kind of existence I want to be.’</p>

<p>“..I see.”</p>
<p>“Well, even though I say that, sometimes I get scared too. Even if it’s the moment of death, I might think, ‘I wish I had lived a little longer.'”</p>

<p>Her expression changed, and she smiled with a hint of helplessness.</p>
<p>…But.</p>

<p>“I suppose it’s not entirely a bad thing, is it?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“A life where you want to live more, in other words, a life that’s so fulfilling and enjoyable that you regret it ending… Isn’t that a happy thing?”</p>
<p>“…..!”</p>

<p>Yuu opened her already large eyes even wider and stared at me intently.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>I felt anxious. After all, we were talking about life and death.</p>
<p>I might have said something inappropriate, and I braced myself for that possibility.</p>

<p>“That’s right!”</p>

<p>She exclaimed with newfound enthusiasm.</p>
<p>Yuu brought her face literally close to mine, eyes and nose just inches away.</p>

<p>“That’s a really good way of thinking! It made me completely change my goal!”</p>

<p>She exclaimed loudly.</p>

<p>“My goal used to be ‘living a fulfilling daily life where I’d be okay with dying anytime,’ but I’m correcting it!”</p>

<p>With a smile on her face, she declared:</p>

<p>“I’ll live a life that’s so amazing that no matter when the end comes, I’ll think ‘I want to live even longer!'”</p>
<p>“Can you just change it so easily?”</p>
<p>“It’s not easy at all! It’s because Shin said that!”</p>
<p>“Which is why I said it’s ‘easy’…”</p>

<p>I started to say but stopped.</p>
<p>The wording of her goal is 180 degrees different, but I suppose the essence of what she wants to do is the same.</p>
<p>Yuu, who seemed to be energized, stood up suddenly.</p>

<p>“I think I do want to experience love and marriage! I’m sure that will make me want to live even longer! There’s no way it’s too early for a high school sophomore!”</p>
<p>“And you’re okay with me being that person?”</p>

<p>Yuu could choose anyone she wanted if she wanted to. But she laughed and said,</p>

<p>“Yes, I want you!”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>Her straightforward words left me speechless.</p>

<p>“You know, I actually admire you. You’re living for yourself and with your own strength. That’s something not everyone can do.”</p>

<p>She turned to me and continued.</p>

<p>“That’s why I chose you as my ‘first love candidate’! How about it? Quite an honor, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>With fireworks in the background, Yuu smiled, showing her white teeth.</p>
<p>Her face was so radiant that it didn’t seem affected by the backlight.</p>
