<h1>Chapter 3: The Reason For Her Moves</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Although I had taken on the role of organizing karaoke reluctantly, I wonder if Yorka would actually show up.</p>



<p>It was hard to imagine Arisaka Yorka willingly participating in any gathering with people other than me. She tended to avoid conversations even in the classroom and prefers being alone. The prospect of a lively, confined space like karaoke, especially with someone she’s meeting for the first time like Sayu, raised the difficulty level even more. Considering her apparent dislike for noisy environments, the chances of her declining karaoke seemed higher.</p>



<p>I’d extend an invitation just in case, but I wouldn’t insist. If she chose not to join, I’d use my organizer’s authority to get Nanamura and Sayu to understand.</p>



<p>On the flip side, I had always been curious about Yorka’s singing voice. I’d like to see her singing.</p>



<p>“Nevertheless, she did mention no texting today. I guess I’ll invite her tomorrow after school.”</p>



<p>Even after returning home, I resisted the urge to send messages obediently. I felt it might work out better if I talked to her directly rather than inviting her through text. I decided to invite her tomorrow at school and headed to bed just before midnight.</p>



<p>After turning off the lights in my room, I closed my eyes. Right when I was about to fall into a deep slumber, I heard the notification sound of a message. I reached for my smartphone on the bedside.</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>“Gather in the art prep room at 7 am tomorrow! No need to reply!”</em></p>



<p>Just by reading the simple message, I found myself naturally smiling.</p>



<p>“Even though she told me no messaging today—oh!”</p>



<p>Looking at the time displayed on my smartphone, it was exactly 00:00.</p>



<p>“To think she’d text me the moment the date changes…”</p>



<p>As I realized that Yorka had also been holding back, I felt delighted.</p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>“Understood. Good night.”</em></p>



<p>I chose to respond. It was already a new day, so there was no need to hold back. The message got marked as read.</p>



<p><strong>Yorka: </strong><em>“Good night.”</em></p>



<p>Such trivial exchanges with a lover made me unreasonably happy. I quickly reset my alarm for the morning, preparing for an early tomorrow.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>Tuesday. The next morning.</p>



<p>“Um, Yorka-san. Is this hug supposed to be a reward…?”</p>



<p>“This is a reward for your patience all day. Any problems with that?” Yorka casually retorted, her voice completely relaxed.</p>



<p>“…Is it okay to be this close in the morning?”</p>



<p>Despite scolding me quite a bit in the student guidance room yesterday, Yorka had completely restored her mood overnight. Moreover, this time, she was on my lap. She wrapped her arms around my back and clung affectionately.</p>



<p>“Yesterday was postponed, so you get two days’ worth. Or do you dislike being hugged by me?”</p>



<p>“I love it.”</p>



<p>“Good.”</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/img_1_11-book_reader_readera.png" alt="" /></div></figure>



<p>In the end, I woke up before my smartphone alarm. I arrived at school earlier than the meeting time and headed straight to the art preparation room, where Yorka was already waiting. She just finished brewing two cups of coffee.</p>



<p>While waiting for the coffee to cool to a drinkable temperature, I sat on a chair. Yorka, as if it were the most natural thing, aligned her knees, sat sideways on my thighs, and then hugged me.</p>



<p>“I really seem to like hugging you, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>Yorka let out a voice that sounded almost like a whimper.</p>



<p><em>No, she’s too cute! She smells so good, and she’s so soft. </em>Frankly, it was impossible to endure.</p>



<p>“I’m so happy I might ascend to Nirvana.”</p>



<p>“…Are you nervous, Kisumi?”</p>



<p>With her cheek against my collarbone, Yorka looked up at me with an upward glance.</p>



<p>“Well, yeah.”</p>



<p>“Why? We’ve hugged many times already.”</p>



<p>“Because every time feels special.”</p>



<p>“You say such nice things. I feel the same way.”</p>



<p>For us, a hug was a reward for someone who had worked hard. Yorka seemed to find my reactions amusing and had an excessively joy expression. She was still incredibly beautiful. Her eyes were so large they could pull you in, and her eyelashes were thick and long. The small mole near her left eye was perpetually sexy. Her high nose and her thin lips glistened in a pink hue. Her skin was as white and radiant as snow.</p>



<p>“You were quite flustered when you hugged me half-asleep that time, though.”</p>



<p>With Yorka looking so pleased, memories of what happened when she stayed over at my place the other day suddenly flashed in my mind.</p>



<p>“That’s because, you know, I secretly took off my bra before going to sleep…”</p>



<p><em>*Snort!*</em></p>



<p>“Hey, what’s with that weird noise?”</p>



<p>The shocking truth was revealed now. After staying overnight due to heavy rain, Yorka, still half-asleep, shared the futon with me and clung to me like a hug pillow. Back then, I was too flustered to comprehend much beyond “<em>Wow, it’s really big and soft.</em>“</p>



<p>“Uh, sorry about that. Even thinking about it now, it was quite a tempting situation.”</p>



<p>I unintentionally glanced at the chest of Yorka’s uniform. Even with clothes on, the volume was unmistakable. Yet, her waist remained slender, showcasing her exceptional figure.</p>



<p><em>Ah, so at that time, there were natural curves under the pajamas. I see…</em></p>



<p>“Don’t bring it up! T-That was just because I was half-asleep! It was just an accident! Just a coincidence! Don’t get any weird ideas!”</p>



<p>Yorka vehemently emphasized the fact that she was half-asleep. Even without her insistence, I wouldn’t think she’d hug me voluntarily.</p>



<p>“Huh? Yorka, could it be…”</p>



<p>“I told you, it’s not like that!”</p>



<p>“Oh, sure. Got it,” I could only give a vague response to Yorka’s vehement denial.</p>



<p>My brain was desperately reviewing the situation from that morning. Was it really because she was half-asleep? Suddenly, the context of us sleeping closely took on a whole new meaning.</p>



<p>“H-Hey, don’t think any perverted stuff!”</p>



<p>“I can’t help it.”</p>



<p>Not only was it delightful that a girl you liked showed such a defenseless side exclusively to you. But now that it turned out she did it willingly, that’s…</p>



<p>Could this overwhelming happiness be lethal?</p>



<p>“I’m wearing clothes and a bra now!”</p>



<p>“That’s obvious.”</p>



<p>Yorka seemed flustered, but she didn’t make any attempt to get off my lap. This blissful stimulus, both physically and mentally, relentlessly tormented me. The sweet torture of testing a man’s self-control from the early morning didn’t seem to end.</p>



<p>“I need to be praised for how I resisted so valiantly after having beauty pressed against me in this confined space.”</p>



<p>“…Kisumi, you’re good at coming up with those smooth words, huh?”</p>



<p>“Just my honest thoughts. Is that not allowed?”</p>



<p>“No, it’s fine as it is.”</p>



<p>Yorka, now a bit calmer, buried her face in my neck again. I reciprocated by holding her in silence. It was a moment that blended joy and embarrassment—a special feeling that transcended the typical thrills of love and carnal excitement.</p>



<p>It was the comfort of knowing and feeling that someone cared about you.</p>



<p>Unbeknownst to us, the steam from the coffee had long dissipated. When I glanced at the wall clock, it was already past eight. <em>It’s about time to head to the classroom.</em></p>



<p>“Yorka, we should get going.”</p>



<p>“I want to stay like this a bit longer.”</p>



<p>“I feel the same, but if we dawdle, we’ll be late.”</p>



<p>“The earnest class representative Kisumi.”</p>



<p>“You chose a guy like that, right?”</p>



<p>“It’s not that I dislike the earnest part of you, but… going to the classroom feels like a hassle…”</p>



<p>Yorka let out a dejected sigh.</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>“Because everyone knows we’re dating. Once it gets out, I’m afraid the tension of being caught will disappear. I don’t trust myself to restrain my feelings.”</p>



<p>My girlfriend seemed genuinely troubled by the prospect of our classmates witnessing her affectionate side. </p>



<p><em>Let’s keep the fact that it’s long been noticed by Kanzaki-sensei a secret.</em></p>



<p>“If that’s the case, I’ll just enjoy watching that Yorka and grin to myself.”</p>



<p>I lifted Yorka off my lap and stood up.</p>



<p>“Grinning during class is gross.”</p>



<p>“Then, you have to try your best to make sure I don’t grin.”</p>



<p>“…I messed up your tie when I hugged you.”</p>



<p>Saying so, Yorka started adjusting my tie.</p>



<p>“Kisumi, you’re already grinning. There, done.”</p>



<p>Yorka looked at me with a proud expression.</p>



<p><em>My girlfriend is so cute! </em></p>



<p>She was always quick to show a competitive spirit, and a hint of superiority surfaced whenever she gained the upper hand. It was incredibly straightforward. </p>



<p>Yorka, the unattainable beauty I admired from afar before we started dating, was undoubtedly stunning. However, the unguarded Yorka she revealed as my lover was more precious than anything.</p>



<p>“I love you, Yorka.”</p>



<p>“I know.”</p>



<p>Yorka also truly sensed my feelings.</p>



<p>“Being hugged in the morning got my heart racing,” I honestly confessed.</p>



<p>“Actually, I had tea with Miyauchi-san yesterday. I consulted her about whether I could resist being affectionate with you in the classroom. She said, ‘<em>Just indulge in it first</em>.’ So, I tried that out.”</p>



<p>“…To be honest, I feel reluctant to let go,”  With Yorka’s warmth gone, I was already quite lonely.</p>



<p>“Don’t say that. I feel the same way…” Yorka, too, seemed to be desperately holding back the desire to hug me once more.</p>



<p>“By the way, what happens if you can’t hold back anymore?”</p>



<p>“Who knows? I might just suddenly hug you out of the blue.” Yorka laughed jokingly.</p>



<p>“I don’t mind.”</p>



<p>“You’re really sweet to me.”</p>



<p>“If I’m not sweet to my girlfriend, who should I be sweet to?”</p>



<p>“…I like that about you too.”</p>



<p>Her straightforward display of affection made me feel like I was going to die.</p>



<p><em>This is dangerous. My girlfriend is too cute!</em></p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>Finally, leaving the art preparation room, we headed towards the Class 2-A. As we walked side by side in the corridor, many students glanced at us with curious eyes. Still, thanks to the morning hug, Yorka was in a good mood.</p>



<p>Alright, now was the perfect time to bring up the karaoke plan with Nanamura and the others.</p>



<p>“Hey, so, we’re going to karaoke with Nanamura and the others this Friday. Would you like to join, Yorka?”</p>



<p>“No.”</p>



<p>She rejected it without even a hint of hesitation. She didn’t even bother to ask for details.</p>



<p>“Oh, well. That’s a no, then.”</p>



<p>“Rather, why do you think I’d go?” Yorka responded as if it was obvious. Her consistency made me feel somewhat relieved. In a sense, her reaction was as expected.</p>



<p>“Because you’ll spend a good time with your boyfriend so I thought you might surprisingly be okay with it.”</p>



<p>“You know I’m not good with that kind of lively atmosphere, like karaoke, right?”</p>



<p>“Well, yeah, I know. But could it be you’re not good at singing?”</p>



<p>“I like music.”</p>



<p>“There’s really nothing you’re bad at.”</p>



<p>Being able to handle most things above average was quite something.</p>



<p>“…It’s not like that.”</p>



<p>“Can you tell me one weakness for future reference?”</p>



<p>“…………” Yorka, lowering her face, pointed softly at me instead of answering. I turned to look behind me, but of course there was nothing there.</p>



<p>“Ah, well. That’s, um… thanks.” I ended up feeling embarrassed too.</p>



<p>“That’s why.” Although she said it first, she blushed to her ears. It seemed the morning hug’s effect was indeed big on her.</p>



<p>“Your surprise attack is unfair, Yorka.”</p>



<p>“I will only do it occasionally.”</p>



<p>“Hey, Yorka.”</p>



<p>“What?”</p>



<p>“Can we hug one more time?”</p>



<p>“────No, not in the hallway!” At Yorka’s loud voice, students in the hallway turned to look at us.</p>



<p>“Yoryor, Sumisumi! Good morning!” When we entered the classroom, Miyauchi Hinaka noticed us and came over.</p>



<p>“Good morning, Miyauchi-san.”</p>



<p>“Morning, Miyachi.”</p>



<p>“You two are lovey-dovey even from the morning ~”</p>



<p>Miyauchi Hinaka was a very petite girl with flashy blonde short hair, piercings on her ears, and big round eyes that gave her a small-animal-like impression. Slim with fair skin, she wore an oversized purple hoodie over her uniform, letting the long sleeves flap around.</p>



<p>“Yoryor, you tried it right away!” Miyachi squinted her eyes.</p>



<p>“Well, yeah. Something like that,” Yorka acknowledged this while being conscious of me, about how she put Miyachi’s advice from yesterday into action.</p>



<p>“Miyachi, I heard you were with Yorka yesterday. Thanks.”</p>



<p>“You don’t have to thank me, Sumisumi. I just hung out with a friend.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I had fun too. Thanks, Miyauchi-san.”</p>



<p>Hearing this, Miyachi spoke with a hint of dissatisfaction, “Hey, Yoryor, there’s something I’ve been wanting to say.”</p>



<p>“W-What is it?”</p>



<p>“Using ‘san’ is too formal. We’re friends, so feel free to call me by my first name.”</p>



<p>“But it’s too sudden…”</p>



<p>“Don’t be shy. Come on, right now, start calling me by my name!”</p>



<p>Miyachi waved her sleeves, egging Yorka on.</p>



<p>“Um… then, I’ll call you Hinaka. Hinaka-chan.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, that’s perfect, Yoryor!” Miyachi showed her canine teeth and smiled happily.</p>



<p>Yorka wasn’t accustomed to close interactions with her female friends. She looked a bit uneasy as she took her seat.</p>



<p>“Yoryor is really innocent. It makes me all fluttery.”</p>



<p>“Having you around is reassuring,” I said.</p>



<p>“I like Yoryor too, you know.”</p>



<p>It was truly great that Yorka, who struggled with socializing, had found someone other than me to open up to.</p>



<p>“Yo, good morning!” As if swapping with Yorka, Nanamura joined the conversation.</p>



<p>“Sena, how about that thing with Arisaka-chan?”</p>



<p>“Nope. She doesn’t show the slightest interest.”</p>



<p>“That’s so typical Arisaka-chan,” Nanamura seemed to have expected this situation from the start.</p>



<p>“What should we do? Should only the three of us go?”</p>



<p>“Unthinkable! We need more girls! So, Miyauchi, how about it? Let’s go to karaoke this Friday after school.”</p>



<p>“Karaoke? Sounds good! I’m in! I’ll showcase my singing talents!”</p>



<p>Nanamura invited Miyachi, who was right beside him and she enthusiastically agreed.</p>



<p>“Nice, Miyauchi!” Nanamura and Miyachi high-fived on the spot. Due to the height difference, it looked like Miyachi was doing a vertical jump.</p>



<p>“You mentioned three people, right? Who’s the other one?”</p>



<p>“Sena’s junior from middle school. She’s the cute one.”</p>



<p>“Huh, a girl? Isn’t that a bit risky? Doesn’t Yoryor have anything to say about this?” Miyachi’s expression darkened slightly.</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. Since Sena is organizing it and he only has eyes for Arisaka-chan, there won’t be any issues.”</p>



<p>“I invited Yorka earlier, but she turned me down before I could explain the details,” I confessed honestly.</p>



<p>“…I’ll explain the situation and invite Yoryor again. Just wait a bit.” Without waiting for a response, Miyachi headed towards Yorka’s seat. Nanamura and I watched the scene unfold.</p>



<p>“If Miyachi goes, Yorka will probably join.”</p>



<p>“I don’t know. Arisaka-chan won’t come unless there’s a good reason,” asserted Nanamura.</p>



<p>“Does that mean Yorka wouldn’t mind if I hang out with another girl? I’d be seriously worried if I were her.”</p>



<p>“Idiot, it’s the opposite. Arisaka-chan trusts you enough to believe you won’t cheat on her.” Nanamura’s words, rich in romantic experience, boosted my confidence.</p>



<p>Miyachi, who was talking to Yorka, turned back and crossed her arms above her head, forming an ‘X’. It seemed her invitation was also unsuccessful.</p>



<p>I wanted Yorka to come somehow. But as Nanamura said, finding that ‘good reason’ wasn’t easy.</p>



<p>Before I could think of a convincing reason, Kanzaki-sensei entered the classroom. The usual morning homeroom began.</p>



<p>Throughout the day, I observed Yorka’s behavior in the classroom, but it seemed unchanged from before. The morning hug in the art preparation room truly had a tremendous effect.</p>



<p>However, during math class when I was called to the blackboard to solve equations, I felt an unusual gaze on my back. When I turned around, Yorka was staring at me intently.</p>



<p>“So, this is what Kanzaki-sensei was talking about. No wonder it’s noticeable.”</p>



<p>For a conspicuous girl like Yorka, even subtle movements attracted attention.</p>



<p>After writing down my answers, I casually took a detour and passed by Yorka’s desk. I leaned closer to her and whispered, “You’re looking at me too much.”</p>



<p>Yorka startled, covering her ears and glaring at me as if blaming me. I merely warned her; I didn’t do anything to warrant getting scolded for.</p>



<p>Once seated, my phone in my pocket vibrated</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Seriously, my ears are sensitive! Are you doing this on purpose?</em></p>



<p>She’s being unreasonable. If I spoke to her in a regular voice, everyone would hear.</p>



<p>Immediately, another message arrived.</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Also, you made a miscalculation.</em></p>



<p>“Sorry, Sensei! I noticed a calculation error, may I redo it?”</p>



<p>I hastily raised my voice, prompting laughter in the class. Apparently, I wasn’t that different from Yorka as I distracted by my girlfriend’s gaze.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>4</strong></p>


<p>The next day. Wednesday morning.</p>



<p>When I left home at the usual time unlike yesterday, Yukinami Sayu was waiting in front of my house.</p>



<p>“Good morning! Let’s go to school together, Senpai!”</p>



<p>“Whoa!? Morning. Why are you here?”</p>



<p>Despite being not a morning person, she’s donned her school uniform fashionably while wearing a bright smile.</p>



<p>“Since we’re going to the same school again, I thought it’d be nice to chat with Senpai on the way.”</p>



<p>“If you were waiting, you could’ve just pressed the intercom.”</p>



<p>“Mornings are busy, so I didn’t want to cause any inconvenience. I also wanted to surprise you a bit.”</p>



<p>“You really enjoy surprise attacks, huh?”</p>



<p>She suddenly appeared in the hallway last time, surprising me quite a bit.</p>



<p>“Pfft! Surprises are my specialty! Don’t change the nuance subtly, please!”</p>



<p>“I don’t mind going to school together, but you’ve become quite the early riser.”</p>



<p>“After Senpai retired, I’ve been joining morning practice alone.”</p>



<p>“You’ve grown. Good job.” I sighed deeply. </p>



<p>They said that troublesome kids were the cutest, and after about a year and a half of picking up Sayu from the Yukinami household almost every morning, I couldn’t help but feel sentimental. Sayu was an excellent player, and I took pride in supporting her plays behind the scenes.</p>



<p>“Getting compliments at this point feels kind of awkward.”</p>



<p>“You’ll get all cocky if I praise you, right?”</p>



<p>“I don’t like guys who aren’t gentle.”</p>



<p>“Then it seems like I’m not liked. I’m heading out first; I’ll be late.”</p>



<p>“Wait up!” As I started walking, Sayu followed alongside.</p>



<p>“Senpai, you were up quite early yesterday. When I came to pick you up, I was told you’d already left. Is it because of class rep duties or something?”</p>



<p>“You came yesterday morning too?”</p>



<p>“Yes. But you stood me up.”</p>



<p>“We didn’t make any plans in the first place. If you’re coming, at least give me a heads-up.”</p>



<p>“…Um, is it okay if I send a LINE message?” Sayu’s eyes widened.</p>



<p>“I could decline in advance if you sent me a text.”</p>



<p>“That’s mean! You would decline? Senpai, you’re such a devil.”</p>



<p>With such banter, we engaged in casual conversation until we merged into the crowd of students in the same uniforms.</p>



<p>“Did your girlfriend agree to karaoke?”</p>



<p>“She declined. She said she’s not interested.”</p>



<p>“You need to be more responsible as the one in charge. Also, do most girls turn down the invitation from their boyfriends?”</p>



<p>“That’s just how Yorka is.”</p>



<p>“Could it be she secretly dislikes you? My condolences.”</p>



<p>“Don’t console me. Yorka and I are doing fine.”</p>



<p>“Oh, really, hmm…” Sayu gazed at my face intently.</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“It just doesn’t seem like you’re putting on a front. It contradicts my analysis a bit.”</p>



<p>“What do you mean by analysis?”</p>



<p>“I thought maybe you took advantage of Arisaka-senpai’s weakness and gradually entered a relationship before forcing a public announcement. Perhaps she is just trying things out, not serious about you.”</p>



<p>“You’ve got quite the imagination,” I said, exasperated.</p>



<p>“Well, you two are the most shocking couple in the school. People talk about this a lot.”</p>



<p>“There’s no gossip to meet your expectations. We simply like each other, I confessed, and we started dating.”</p>



<p>It was quite straightforward when you put it into words.</p>



<p>“You can’t end up dating someone so beautiful by just doing things normally.”</p>



<p>“Are you really curious about how we got together?”</p>



<p>“…Alright then, what if I told you I’ve got someone I like? What would you think, Senpai?”</p>



<p>“Huh, for real this time? Who is it?”</p>



<p>“Come on, Senpai, you’re interested in other people’s love lives too! You’re getting too into this!”</p>



<p>“No, it’s just I can’t imagine what kind of guy you like.”</p>



<p>Sayu had been popular among guys since middle school. Come to think of it, I had never asked about her ideal type.</p>



<p>“It was surprising even for me.”</p>



<p>“Wait, really?”</p>



<p>Apparently, she did have someone in mind. Her reaction is unusually meek. I wonder who managed to capture Yukinami Sayu’s heart.</p>



<p>“Could it be… you’re a bit disappointed because your cute junior has someone she likes?” Sayu grinned slyly while staring at my face.</p>



<p>“Well, maybe a little…”</p>



<p>“I-I didn’t expect such a straightforward reaction, I got a bit confused.” For some reason, Sayu seemed perplexed.</p>



<p>“Anyway, I’m rooting for you. I don’t know who it is, but I hope everything works out.”</p>



<p>“That’s none of your business.”</p>



<p>“Why are you getting mad?”</p>



<p>I had no idea.</p>



<p>Somehow, we had arrived near the school gate without realizing it. As we were about to turn the corner, I almost collided with a girl coming from the opposite direction.</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai!” Sayu, who noticed first, pulled my arm.</p>



<p>“Whoa.”</p>



<p>“Ah, sorry.”</p>



<p>Our eyes met with the girl.</p>



<p>“Oh, good morning, Kisumi-kun.” Hasekura Asaki greeted me with a smile. </p>



<p>She’s my classmate and also a fellow class representative. Just the other day, she confessed to me and I turned her down.</p>



<p>“Good morning, Asaki-san.” I managed to stick to our usual routine and addressed her by her first name. Asaki-san, the central figure of our grade, looked radiant as always.</p>



<p>Her loosely permed, bright brown hair swayed around her shoulders. The subtle makeup enhanced her well-defined features, and her sense of fashion shone through with tasteful accessories.</p>



<p>“It’s rare to meet you on the way to school. Is this your usual time, Kisumi-kun?”</p>



<p>“Today’s just a coincidence.”</p>



<p>“Oh, really? Arisaka-san isn’t with you this morning. This girl is cute too.” Asaki-san suddenly noticed Sayu who was beside me and made a prickly remark.</p>



<p>“Um, about her…”</p>



<p>“Yesterday you walked into the classroom with your girlfriend and today you’re happily arm in arm with another girl. Sena-kun, you’re quite popular, aren’t you?” Asaki-san interjected before I could explain, maintaining her smiling demeanor that’s a bit intimidating.</p>



<p><em>I know, I know. </em>If I were walking to school with my girlfriend, Yorka, it would be understandable. But walking with a different girl today did raise some eyebrows.</p>



<p>I untangled Sayu’s still-linked arm from mine and began my explanation. “This girl is my junior from middle school. We happened to walk together today because her house is nearby, Asaki-san.”</p>



<p>“Oh, I see. I didn’t know you had such a cute junior. Are you keeping her a secret too?”</p>



<p>Considering the recent announcement of my relationship, I steadied myself before replying to her probing question.  “No, I only found out she was in Eisei recently.”</p>



<p>Upon my response, Asaki-san looked at Sayu with interest.</p>



<p>“Hey, hey, Senpai. Why are you so friendly with Hasekura-senpai? You call each other by your first names and all,” Sayu whispered, tugging on my sleeve.</p>



<p>“Why do you even know Asaki-san?” When I looked at Asaki-san, she shook her head. </p>



<p>“She came to the tea ceremony club for a trial membership once. I believe her name was… Yukinami Sayu-san, right?” Asaki-san, who was good at remembering other people’s faces and names, said her name accurately.</p>



<p>“Wow, you remembered! Yes, I’m Yukinami, a first-year.”</p>



<p>“Sorry, your impression was so different last time that I couldn’t recall your name immediately. You seem energetic now.”</p>



<p>“Y-Yeah, that’s true. Last time it was early in the morning.”</p>



<p>“Yukinami-san, are you not interested in joining the tea ceremony club?”</p>



<p>“To be honest, I’m not good at sitting formally, and besides, the club advisor seemed strict.”</p>



<p>The advisor for the tea ceremony club, of course, was my homeroom teacher, Kanzaki Shizuru.</p>



<p>“That’s a shame. Kanzaki-sensei is really nice. Right, Kisumi-kun?”</p>



<p>“Why are you asking me?”</p>



<p>“You’re the one who’s been most helpful to her. You’ve been trusted as a class rep since our first year and you two seem to have a close relationship.”</p>



<p>“When you put it like that, it sounds like some touching story with a teacher.” I deflected with a light-hearted response, but I didn’t deny it.</p>



<p>“Hey, how about we continue this conversation while walking? We might be late if we stand here.” Prompted by Asaki-san, the three of us started walking side by side.</p>



<p>The glances directed at me from passing male students were painful. Well, if you were walking with Asaki-san and Sayu on either side, it was bound to attract attention.</p>



<p>“You’re quite the popular guy to have both of us by your side since morning, Kisumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“Coming from you, that sounds like a compliment.”</p>



<p>“Well, I am popular, after all.” Asaki-san confidently declared without a hint of embarrassment. </p>



<p>Her popularity was a well-known fact, and her straightforward and bright personality played a significant role. She was adept at consideration and skilled at giving compliments, a popular figure without any airs.</p>



<p>“What kind of person are you dating, Hasekura-senpai?” Sayu’s question assumed Asaki-san had a boyfriend out of the blue.</p>



<p>“I’m not dating anyone. Plus, I just got turned down recently,” Asaki-san said, lowering her voice as if it’s a secret.</p>



<p>I almost snorted secretly.</p>



<p>“What!? Even Hasekura-senpai goes through that?”</p>



<p>“It happens. Come to think of it, both confessing and getting rejected were firsts for me.”</p>



<p>“The other person must be an incredibly handsome guy if he turned down someone as beautiful as you.”</p>



<p>“He’s just an ordinary person.”</p>



<p>“I hope whoever turned down your confession regrets it for life. But, he must lack discernment or has a good reason not to accept Hasekura-senpai’s confession, right?”</p>



<p>“Thanks for comforting me, Yukinami-san. You’re so kind.”</p>



<p>“Just call me Sayu!”</p>



<p>“Alright, Sayu-chan it is. You don’t have to call me by my surname either.”</p>



<p>“Yes, Asa-senpai!”</p>



<p>In an instant, Asaki-san and Sayu hit it off. Listening to their conversation, my stomach churned.</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai, don’t you think the other person is being mean too? Who does he think he is for rejecting Asa-senpai’s first confession?”</p>



<p>“Hahaha. Yeah, pretty much.” A dry laugh was all that came out.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kisumi-kun, won’t you comfort me too?”</p>



<p>“Huh? Me!?”</p>



<p>“Yeah.” Asaki-san asked with a smile.</p>



<p>“Well, there’s not much I can say…”</p>



<p>“Nothing at all?”</p>



<p>“Ugh…”</p>



<p>Why was Asaki-san acting so nonchalant about this? Was it a way of getting back at me, the one who rejected her confession? Or perhaps, confessing meant little to her compared to what I thought. I couldn’t fathom the reason behind her remarkably indifferent attitude.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun is very fun to tease.” Asaki-san smiled mysteriously.</p>



<p>“You’re not very sharp, Ki-senpai. Women’s hearts easily drift away if you can’t say something clever when it matters.”</p>



<p>“That’s right ~ ” Asaki-san playfully chimed in agreement.</p>



<p>“Oh! Since we’re at it, why not join us for karaoke, Asa-senpai? We’re going this Friday with Ki-senpai and Nanamura-senpai,” Sayu suggested.</p>



<p>“Sayu, what are you saying?”</p>



<p>“I thought Asa-senpai could use a little distraction. Plus, it’s not a problem, right? Nanamura-senpai is her classmate too.”</p>



<p>“You’re being too forward all of a sudden.”</p>



<p>“I just want to talk more and become friends with Asa-senpai.”</p>



<p>It seemed like Sayu had taken a liking to Asaki-san.</p>



<p>“Sure, I’m free on Friday. I’ll come too,” Asaki-san agreed without hesitation.</p>



<p>“Huh? You’re not refusing?”</p>



<p>“Why would I? Is there a problem with me being there?”</p>



<p>“Well, if you’re fine with it, then I guess it’s okay…” My response became awkward unintentionally.</p>



<p>“Then it’s settled. I haven’t been to karaoke in ages, so I’m looking forward to it! Sayu-chan, thanks for inviting me!”</p>



<p>“I’m happy I get to hang out with you, Asa-senpai!”</p>



<p>The two girls, who had quickly become close, exchanged contact information and completely left me out of the loop.</p>



<p>This was turning into quite a situation. I got abandoned as the organizer, and the participants was increasing on its own.</p>



<p>Amidst this chaos, we arrived at school. After passing through the gate, we parted ways with Sayu.</p>



<p>“I had no idea you have such a cute underclassman. You guys seem close.”</p>



<p>“It’s because of Sayu’s personality. She quickly got close to you too.”</p>



<p>“Well, let’s just go with that.” After we changed into indoor shoes, Asaki-san asked to confirm.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kisumi-kun, who’s coming to karaoke?”</p>



<p>“It’s me, Nanamura, Sayu, and Miyachi. And you too.”</p>



<p>“Hinaka-chan is coming, but not Arisaka-san?”</p>



<p>“I invited her but she declined.”</p>



<p>“Hmm. Why not try inviting her again? I think she’d come if you mention this group.”</p>



<p>“No way. Yorka doesn’t change her mind so easily.”</p>



<p>“Is that so—ah!” Asaki-san, as if she had a sudden idea, curved her lips into a crescent-moon smile. Her gaze was fixed behind me.</p>



<p>“Thanks for inviting me! I’m looking forward to the karaoke on Friday!” Asaki-san suddenly raised her voice and headed toward the stairs.</p>



<p>“What was that just now?”</p>



<p>“Kisumi!” When I turned around, Arisaka Yorka was there, having just arrived at school.</p>



<p>“Did you invite Hasekura Asaki to karaoke too?”</p>



<p>“No, it was my kouhai who invited her! Not me!”</p>



<p>“But she’s going too, right?”</p>



<p>“Well, it just happened that way…”</p>



<p>Yorka stared at me as if she wanted to say something. Seemingly exploding with jealousy, instead, she declared, “I’m going too!”</p>



<p>As it turned out, Asaki-san’s participation was the ‘good reason’ that Yorka needed.</p>



<p>Yorka decided to join the karaoke.</p>
