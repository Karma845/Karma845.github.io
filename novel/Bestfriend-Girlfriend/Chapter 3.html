<h1>Chapter 3: Gal and Manga Club</h1>


<p>It was after school, a little past 3:40 PM, and the setting sun dazzled my eyes as it sank.</p>
<p>Carrying my school bag while walking through the second-floor corridor, I headed towards Building B, where the cultural club rooms were located.</p>
<p>Then, just ahead of me, in front of an empty classroom, I spotted a seemingly popular group of two boys and three girls, standing in a circle and engaged in conversation.</p>
<p>Trying to avoid them, I thought to myself, ‘Get out of the way, the great introvert-sama is passing through…’, but as I was about to walk past them—</p>

<p>“Oh, Nezumayo-kun! Hey—!”</p>
<p>“…ah.”</p>

<p>One of them, Tsumakawa-san, called out to me.</p>
<p>I, I didn’t expect she was here… Also, Tsumakawa always calls me ‘Nezumayo,’ but that’s technically my Twitter account name, so I’d prefer she didn’t use that name…?</p>
<p>As I kept walking down the corridor thinking like that, she excused herself to the group with ‘I’ll be right back’ and then came up to me.</p>

<p>“Where are you off to?”</p>
<p>“Just heading to club activities…”</p>
<p>“Club activities? Hey, Nezumayo-kun, you’re in a club. Which one?”</p>
<p>“Manga Research Club.”</p>
<p>“Manga Research Club!? Heck, that sounds like a blast! Count me in, you hear!”</p>
<p>“Why are you suddenly speaking in a rough Kansai dialect…? Also, are you coming along too—?”</p>
<p>“Alright, everyone! I’m going to sneak a peek at Nez——Yoda’s club activity, go ahead first!”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa declared loudly to the members of the popular group. The group responded in unison.</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>
<p>“Miona, you really like Yoda, huh?”</p>
<p>“I’ll be at the usual McDonald’s, so come by when you’re done.”</p>
<p>“Well then, see you tomorrow.”</p>

<p>…When one of the boys casually mentioned my name, my body twitched, but let’s keep that to myself!</p>
<p>And so, after gaining everyone’s approval, Tsumakawa turned to me again.</p>

<p>“Alright, let’s go to the Manga Club together!”</p>
<p>“Ehh…I don’t want to.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean you don’t want to? It’s your ‘I don’t want to’ that I don’t want!</p>
<p>“Gal, are you trying to ruin the Japanese language? …Anyway, Tsumakawa-san, the Manga Club isn’t really that interesting. So, you’d better not come along…”</p>
<p>“Whether it’s interesting or not is for me to decide, so don’t worry! Besides, even if it’s not interesting, I’ll pretend it was interesting, so leave it to me!”</p>
<p>“I think Gal’s ability to see things positively is a bit too high…?”</p>
<p>“Ehehee, somehow? …but of course, even though I’m generally positive, there are times when I get negative if things don’t go well at work or something. At such times, I read light novels or call my friends! It’s the worst to hold onto negativity without letting it out!”</p>
<p>“It’s a good thing that you have the option to ‘rely on friends’ when you become negative…”</p>
<p>“If something happens to Yoda too, be sure to call me right away——Miona will come to your rescue!”</p>
<p>“Why did you suddenly say an ikemen line…?”</p>

<p>Speaking of which, we don’t even know each other’s phone numbers, so we can’t call each other in emergencies…</p>
<p>Internally pointing out the contradiction, I sighed inwardly.</p>

<p>Although I instinctively declined Tsumakawa’s invitation to visit the manga club, I eventually thought, well, maybe it’s okay to at least let her observe our club activities…</p>
<p>So, reluctantly, I said to her,</p>

<p>“Alright, well, let’s go…”</p>
<p>“Yeah! Let’s go, yay!”</p>
<p>“Why does someone with this kind of energy want to observe such a gloomy club activity?”</p>

<p>Or maybe this person is just too comfortable around acquaintances who aren’t all that positive like her?</p>
<p>I guess Gal types don’t mind hanging out with guys they don’t have any romantic interest in…</p>
<p>On her days off, she probably goes out to clubs with a snobby guy who drives a black wagon while blaring Sandaime J Soul Brothers music, goes clubbing, flaunts some provocative dance moves, occasionally smokes a slim cigarette at the smoking area, and when thirsty, orders a Cassis Orange at the counter…</p>
<p>Wait… what a terrible prejudice!</p>

<p>With these thoughts, Tsumakawa and I walked side by side in the corridor.</p>
<p>Eventually, as we reached Building B lined with cultural club rooms and climbed the stairs to the third floor, she asked me,</p>

<p>“Do you often go to the manga club?”</p>
<p>“No, not at all… I’m usually a ghost member, but today, I got a direct summons from the club president… So, I’m reluctantly going.”</p>
<p>“Really? Manga club seems fun, though.”</p>
<p>“Actually, in high school, I wanted to start a light novel club… But my popularity was too lacking, so I couldn’t gather enough members to make it happen.”</p>
<p>“A light novel club!? What’s that? I’m definitely joining! Seriously joining! Five times joining!”</p>
<p>“Even if I managed to create it, you can only join once…”</p>
<p>“But isn’t it okay if I keep joining and leaving?”</p>
<p>“That’s just being a nuisance. Once you join, please don’t leave!”</p>

<p>As we continued chatting like that, we arrived at the manga club room.</p>
<p>And so, I knocked on the door of the club room. Knock, knock.</p>
<p>From inside, I heard a voice saying, ‘Come in.’ I reached for the door handle and slid it open.</p>
<p>And then, there—</p>

<p>“It’s been a while, my cute junior (kawaii kohai-kun). I guess I should say ‘I’m glad to see you again after such a long time,’ because saying that would raise your favorability towards me. I’ll say it——I’m glad to see you again after such a long time, kyun♡”</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/Lv-99/g7.png"/>

<p>——A girl with plain looks, sporting black hair in three braids and a pair of nerdy glasses… Yui Hinashiro, the senior and president of this manga club, was seated at the back of the room, striking a kyun pose.</p>

<p>“Long time no see, Hinashiro-senpai. For now, please stop the boring teasing.”</p>
<p>“Don’t say such a terrible thing to a senior who was trying to be nice to a socially awkward junior, kyun♡”</p>
<p>“Why is your ending sentence weird? Can’t you fix that?”</p>
<p>“Because I want to see Yoda’s ‘Hinashiro Senpai is being tiresome’ face more, so I won’t stop, kyun♡”</p>
<p>“Even though you know I dislike it, you still keep doing it…It’s so like you.”</p>

<p>In response to my comment, Hinashiro-senpai laughed cheerfully with a ‘Gahaha!’ and then, casting her gaze towards Tsumakawa, the sunny gal standing behind me.</p>


<p>“By the way, who might the girl behind Yoda be? Yoda’s Stand?”</p>
<p>(TN: a Stand is a manifestation of a character’s fighting spirit, Jojo.)</p>
<p>“There’s no way he’s my Stand. What kind of ability would a gal’s Stand have?”</p>
<p>“It’s probably an ability like making the eyelashes of the person you attack grow longer.”</p>
<p>“Senpai, you’re just talking nonsense, seriously stop it.”</p>
<p>“Yahoo! Nice to meet you, Senpai! I’m Nezu’s— no, I mean, Yoda’s Stand, ‘Vibes Club’! Gyaaaaaan!”</p>
<p>“Tsumakawa, can you stop saying random things and doing Jojo poses? And the name of your Stand sounds way too gal-like.”</p>

<p>As I pointed this out, Tsumakawa, looked satisfied for some reason, then stepped forward.</p>
<p>Afterward, she faced Hinashiro-senpai again and reintroduced herself with a fresh greeting.</p>

<p>“Hello, I’m Miona Tsumakawa, a first-year student! I’m a pretty dedicated gal! My favorite gal is Risepoyo-chan! My personal color is Warm Summer! Nice to meet you!”</p>
<p>“Nice to meet you too! ——As for me, I’m Yui Hinashiro! Currently a second-year high school student and a tight-knit otaku girl! My favorite manga is ‘Dennokoman’! Keep it a secret, but I am a fujoshi! Personal color? I don’t really understand the whole Yellow-based (Warm) and Blue-based (Cool) thing because my ‘girl power’ is low!”</p>
<p>“Really? Show me a bit of your skin!”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa said this and approached Hinashiro-senpai, gazing at her face up close.</p>
<p>At that moment, Hinashiro-senpai exclaimed,</p>

<p>“Hey, too close… But she smells good! It’s not an overpowering perfume, but it has a nice scent! Amazing!”</p>

<p>‘So much fuss? Are you some kind of virgin boy or what?’</p>
<p>And then, after thoroughly examining the president’s complexion, Tsumakawa seemed satisfied and said,</p>

<p>“Maybe Warm Summer is more suited for you, but I’m not really sure!”</p>
<p>“You’re not sure! You’ve stared for quite a while, and you’re still not sure!”</p>

<p>After Hinashiro-senpai retorted with all her might, she blinked and said, ‘Oh no, this girl is interesting… I like her…’ Her falling-in-love speed was almost as fast as that of a virgin guy.</p>

<p>“Today, Tsumakawa-san wanted to observe the club activities, so I brought her along. Is that okay?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s fine! There’s nothing much going on, but feel free to observe.”</p>
<p>“Well, thanks!”</p>
<p>“…By the way, Yoda, why are you getting so friendly with this cute gal? You were supposed to be like me, a gray high schooler who avoids interactions with the opposite sex. We promised to spend our youth without getting involved with the opposite sex…”</p>
<p>“We never made such a promise.”</p>

<p>Moreover, Tsumakawa-san and I aren’t exactly close… It’s just that I found out she’s my online friend ‘Nezumayo’, and through that connection, Tsumakawa recently chatted with me.</p>
<p>It’s likely just a passing fad…</p>

<p>Because on the other hand, I also have not been able to get rid of my inherent discomfort, and I’m struggling to figure out how to interact with her.</p>
<p>I can have a conversation if I match her strong communicative abilities, but it feels like it’s just a superficial conversation, or at least that’s what I thought.</p>

<p>With these thoughts in mind, I looked at Tsumakawa-san… She was looking at the spines of the manga stacked on the bookshelves of the club room, saying things like, ‘Wow, I can really feel the history. Such ancient vibes.’</p>
<p>Her gal-style impressions were quite bewildering. And then, I turned back to Hinashiro-senpai and asked her once again.</p>

<p>“…So? I was just told to come to the club activities today. What do you need?”</p>
<p>“Could you draw three more 4-koma strips? Please draw them.”</p>
<p>“I see, it’s for the club magazine… But you only need three more 4-koma strips left?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s right. Because for this issue, I basically filled most of it myself. It’s 28 pages… Even though it’s a manga club, hardly anyone else except me draws manga. What’s wrong with this Manga club?”</p>
<p>“Nakamachi, me, and Mizusaki are all pretty lazy… Keep up the good work, President!”</p>
<p>“You need to work hard, too! “</p>

<p>Hinashiro-senpai said this while getting angry at me, but honestly, people download the club magazine mainly to read her professional-level manga… If her manga is featured, other members’ manga becomes unnecessary.</p>

<p>By the way, the club magazine we’re talking about is a manga that the Manga Research Club publishes digitally once a month.</p>
<p>Once the digital manuscript is completed, its QR code is posted on the school bulletin board, making it accessible for all the students to read.</p>
<p>So, it seems that the reason I was called to the club activities this time was to create the remaining three 4-koma manga strips to be included in the magazine.</p>
<p>4-koma comics… While I do enjoy reading light novels and manga, I lack the creativity needed for original content. I’m more of a typical consumer otaku.</p>

<p>As I was thinking this, Hinashiro-senpai’s expression softened, and she continued speaking.</p>

<p>“Well, for one of them, ask Nakamachi to wake up and draw it. So, you’ve got two more to go.”</p>
<p>“Understood. I’ll try to come up with something…”</p>
<p>“Don’t just come up with something. Put your heart and your soul into it! ——Well, I’m heading back to work on my manga manuscript for the rookie award!”</p>
<p>“Oh, you’re leaving? Even though your cute junior is about to work hard on drawing 4-koma…”</p>
<p>“Cute junior, ahahaha! Did you just call yourself that? Hahaha!”</p>
<p>“Senpai, didn’t you said that earlier? Have you forgotten already? Are you bird-brained?”</p>

<p>After exchanging such conversation, Hinashiro-senpai hastily gathered her belongings and said to Tsumakawa,</p>

<p>“I’m leaving, but take your time, Tsumakawa-chan!”</p>

<p>She then left the club room.</p>
<p>Tsumakawa, who had been looking at the bookshelves, approached me with a smile.</p>

<p>“Hinashiro-senpai is interesting. Maybe I should join the manga club too.”</p>
<p>“…Tsumakawa-san, you’re a model, right? Do you even have time for club activities?”</p>
<p>“Nope!”</p>
<p>“You don’t? If you don’t have the time, you probably shouldn’t join.”</p>
<p>“But even though I have work, it’s okay if the member doesn’t mind, because I’m also in various other clubs! Like, basketball club, soccer club, and tennis club… Also, I’m pretty sure I’m in the tea ceremony and flower arrangement clubs too! Probably?”</p>
<p>“You’re not even participating, yet you’re juggling five clubs. You’re a club-hopper.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, yay I’m a club-hopper!”</p>
<p>“Why are you so proud of that?”</p>

<p>I retorted to the triumphant gal-peace gesture Tsumakawa gave, and then she looked towards a sofa in the corner of the club room and asked me,</p>

<p>“By the way, someone’s sleeping over there… Who’s that?”</p>
<p>“That’s our mascot, or more accurately, it’s like… a large dog that the manga club takes care of…”</p>
<p>“The Manga Research Club is keeping a high school girl as a mascot? Isn’t that too edgy?”</p>

<p>As Tsumakawa pointed that out, I looked towards the girl sleeping on the sofa.</p>
<p>Her name is Himeko Nakamachi. She’s a petite girl with a cute round face, and despite her small frame, she has a surprisingly full bust.</p>
<p>She has black bob-cut hair, and her droopy eyes are a charming point. She’s also a member of the manga club.</p>
<p>After school, she always curls up and sleeps on this sofa––it’s become her regular routine.</p>


<p>“According to her, ‘I find going home bothersome, so I always take a nap here.’ Hey Nakamachi, wake up! We have an order from the President. We need to draw 4-koma for the club magazine.”</p>
<p>“Eh…? Ah, it’s Yoda-kun… I’m happy to see you after such a long time, ehehe…”</p>
<p>“Never mind that, President wants us to draw 4-koma. I’ll be drawing one too, so you draw one as well.”</p>
<p>“4-koma? Alright… let’s see, let’s figure out together what kind of excuse I can give her so she won’t get mad at me if I don’t draw a four-panel. Let’s think of something together!”</p>
<p>“Don’t try to find excuses to be lazy. Wake up and draw your 4-koma.”</p>

<p>As I said that, Nakamachi let out a big yawn and tried to rope me in.</p>

<p>“Yoda-kun, let’s take a nap together. It feels so good!”</p>

<p>Who in the real world would take a nap with a girl…?</p>
<p>If I did that, I’d probably instantly fall in love with Nakamachi, confess, get rejected, and it would just leave a scar on my heart all over again!</p>
<p>While I was thinking along those lines, Tsumakawa suddenly appeared next to me and greeted Nakamachi.</p>

<p>“Hello, Nakamachi-san. I’m a gal, yay!”</p>
<p>“Don’t give a self-introduction that doesn’t introduce anything. At least say your name.”</p>
<p>“…ah, it’s a gal. There is a cute gal-chan in the club room, yay!”</p>
<p>“Nakamachi, don’t just give half-awake responses. —This is Miona Tsumakawa-san. She’s a cheerful gal who somehow tagged along when I was going to the club activities. She’s also a first-year student like us.”</p>
<p>“Hey there, nice to meet you! Shall I make you join the ranks of the gals?” </p>
<p>“Why did you say something in a Demon Lord’s tone? — Anyway Tsumakawa-san, this is Himeko Nakamachi. She’s basically a girl who does absolutely nothing in the club except sleep on the sofa all day. She’s into sleeping, I guess.”</p>
<p>“Hello, I’m Nakamachi, and my family runs a delicious bakery. My dream is to marry a wealthy man in the future and live a comfortable life with his money. I also love Uber Eats.”</p>
<p>“Even though we have a guest here, she doesn’t even bother getting up from the sofa. She’s seriously like a sleeping beauty and it’s ridiculously cute! Nezumayo-kun said she’s like a large dog––I get it. She’s like the big dog we have at home!”</p>
<p>“Ehehe.”</p>
<p>“She probably didn’t mean to compliment you…”</p>

<p>I instinctively retorted, but then Tsumakawa told me, ‘Oh, I was actually complimenting her.’</p>

<p>…Women’s conversations are too high-context, aren’t they? While thinking this, I suggested again to Nakamachi.</p>

<p>“Anyway, let’s finish quickly and draw the 4-koma.”</p>

<p>In the club room, there’s only one pen-tablet and laptop purchased with the club funds, so I gestured for Nakamachi to sit at the seat with those tools.</p>
<p>Nakamachi then quickly drew the 4-koma while complaining.</p>

<p>“I wish Hina-chan senpai would draw them all…”</p>

<p>Her speed was astonishing, taking less than five minutes.</p>
<p>After she said, ‘It’s done, please check it,’ I promptly checked the 4-koma on the computer screen.</p>

<p>Title: On Hiatus</p>
<p>Panel 1: Two stick figures are drawn, and they have these speech bubbles.</p>
<p>【This panel concludes this 4-koma.】</p>
<p>【Look forward to the next 4-koma!】</p>

<p>“It’s blatantly lazy! Ending a 4-koma on panel 1 is unheard of!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha. Surreal is good, you know?”</p>
<p>“Don’t use surrealism as a cover for laziness!”</p>

<p>As I stared at Nakamachi while giving these retorts, Tsumakawa, who was looking at what was displayed on the computer screen, said,</p>

<p>“Hey, isn’t it actually quite funny?”</p>

<p>…Well, it’s not completely uninteresting.</p>
<p>There’s a sense of holding back on effort, though.</p>

<p>“…well, for now, I’ll just show this to the club president.”</p>
<p>“Yatta, I finished the 4-koma.”</p>
<p>“You only drew one panel, though.”</p>

<p>“It’s all about being eco and LOHAS, Yoda-kun…By the way, what does LOHAS mean?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know either… Why don’t you look it up?”</p>
<p>“I’m not curious enough to go through the trouble of searching for it.”</p>
<p>“You’re the embodiment of youth ignorance. In this age where you can find out almost anything with a smartphone, you can’t even spare the effort to search…”</p>
<p>“I’ve discovered the wisdom and the aesthetic appeal of ignorance, so I don’t need to know anything anymore.”</p>
<p>“Don’t justify your laziness with words that sound smart… By the way, according to what I just looked up, LOHAS stands for ‘Lifestyles of Health and Sustainability.’ It seems to mean ‘healthy and sustainable lifestyle.'”</p>
<p>“Okay, Yoda-kun. Let’s not talk about LOHAS anymore. That’s too much information.”</p>
<p>“Nakamachi, you’re the one who brought it up and yet you’re giving such a salty response?”</p>

<p>When I pointed this out, Nakamachi laughed cheerfully and got up from the seat with the notebook computer.</p>
<p>Then, she lay back down on the sofa again and naturally fell asleep, saying, ‘Ahhh… gwaa.’</p>
<p>She’s way too good at sleeping.</p>

<p>“Don’t fall asleep during conversations with other people!”</p>
<p>“…Nezumayo, you have a close female friend?”</p>

<p>For some reason, Tsumakawa, with a seemingly bored expression, turned her face away from me as if avoiding eye contact and in a somewhat sullen tone, asked me that.</p>

<p>“Close female friend? More like Nakamachi is just a clubmate… We don’t hang out together on our days off, so we’re definitely not friends in the female-friend sense…”</p>
<p>“Really? But just now, you two seemed pretty close. If being able to have a friendly conversation means being friends, then wouldn’t your relationship with her be that of friends?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Isn’t it too early to label it a friendship based on just that?”</p>
<p>“Is it? …Because for me, you address me as ‘Tsumakawa-san’, right? But you called Nakamachi by her name without honorifics… Aren’t you clearly discriminating the two of us?”</p>
<p>“I-I’m not discriminating… it’s just that we’ve been doing club activities together since we first entered the school, and I’ve gotten used to Nakamachi…”</p>
<p>“See? The length of time you’ve spent together has made a clear difference. Nakamachi, who’s been with you since the beginning as a clubmate, and me, just a classmate you’ve only recently gotten to know — that’s why you added ‘san’ to my name, right? Because you haven’t opened up to me yet.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“A punch driven by an emotion that’s definitely ‘not’ jealousy!”</p>
<p>“A punch driven by an emotion that’s definitely not jealousy!?”</p>

<p>I recited Tsumakawa’s words in surprise as I was suddenly hit on the shoulder with a mysterious word.</p>
<p>Uh, what kind of punch was this? If I were to take her words at face value, it seems to be confirmed that she didn’t hit me because she was jealous of my relationship with Nakamachi(?)</p>
<p>As I was panicking like that, Tsumakawa continued with a plainly grumpy look on her face continued her words,</p>

<p>“Let me explain! ‘A punch driven by an emotion that’s definitely not jealousy’ means it’s a punch that isn’t caused by feelings of jealousy!”</p>
<p>“Hasn’t this explanation become even more confusing? I mean, seriously, I’ve never been in a situation where someone says, ‘Let me explain!’ and then doesn’t actually explain anything!”</p>
<p>“Uh, but it’s really the case. Like I said before, I’m not in love with Nezumayo or anything, or at least not yet. So when I saw Nezumayo getting along with Nakamachi-chan, I didn’t really get mad or anything——and I didn’t feel jealous at all. I just, for some reason, felt the urge to give you a full-fledged ‘gyaru punch’ once.”</p>
<p>“…I still don’t get it. If jealousy isn’t the reason, then why did you punch me, Tsumakawa-san?”</p>
<p>“Not even Miona knows that!”</p>
<p>“If the person herself doesn’t know, then how am I supposed to know?”</p>

<p>Rubbing my shoulder where I was punched, I said in a bewildered manner.</p>

<p>“Sorry-sorry. I don’t really regret what I did, but sorry for the punch.”</p>

<p>Then she apologized with a subtle expression. She said that as if she couldn’t decide whether to apologize or not.</p>
<p>This gal… she has quite the character. Does this gal really feel sorry?</p>
<p>With those thoughts in mind, I switched places with Nakamachi and took a seat at the computer.</p>
<p>Thus, I picked up a pen to draw the remaining two 4-koma comics that Hinashiro-senpai had requested.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>By the way, this is a bit of an ending twist…but later, when I submitted the two 4-koma comics I had drawn to the club president, she gently rejected them.</p>

<p>『Let’s set aside Yoda’s and I’ll draw the two myself!』</p>

<p>That’s what she said…</p>
<p>…Hey, isn’t that weird? Nakamachi’s 5-minute comic got accepted, but the one I worked so hard on got rejected?</p>
<p>Is being funny really that important? Oh god! (crying.jpg)</p>
