<h1>Chapter 3: Shimizu-san and Anime</h1>

<p>“Let’s talk about love, Hondo-kun.”</p>
<p>“Suddenly?”</p>

<p>One day after school, when I arrived at the club room, Seto-san and Shimizu-san were already there.</p>
<p>Shimizu-san was lying face down on the desk, probably because she had missed her afternoon nap due to being called on frequently during class.</p>
<p>Without paying much attention to Shimizu-san, Seto-san’s first suggestion was to talk about love.</p>

<p>“There’s nothing sudden about discussing love. Start whenever you want to start——that’s what Ai Senpai used to say.”</p>
<p>“I think it’s best not to take Ai-san’s words too seriously.”</p>

<p>Ai-san is a good person, but sometimes she talks based on her feelings.</p>

<p>” …I’ll keep that in mind. So, will you talk about love with me, Hondo-kun?”</p>
<p>“Sure, but Shimizu-san might hear us if she wakes up, you know?”</p>

<p>Seto-san probably doesn’t want anyone to know that she’s interested in Toshiya.</p>

<p>“It’s fine. I’ll talk in a way that won’t be a problem even if we are heard.”</p>
<p>“Alright. I’ll do the same, then. So what should we talk about this time?”</p>
<p>“Today’s topic is, ‘Where would you like to go with the person you like?’ “</p>
<p>“You mean a date?”</p>
<p>“It’s more like a place you’d be happy to go to together.”</p>
<p>“I see. By the way, Seto-san, do you have a place in mind where you’d like to go?”</p>

<p>Since I can’t think of any specific locations, I’ll use Seto-san’s opinion for reference.</p>

<p>“Me? I’d like to go…”</p>

<p>Where would Seto-san want to go with Toshiya?</p>
<p>Since Seto-san is a library committee member, maybe a bookstore or library?</p>

<p>“To a Japanese confectionery shop.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I want to go to a Japanese confectionery shop.”</p>

<p>That was entirely outside my expectations. I don’t think many people would have been able to predict that.</p>

<p>“Why would you want to go to a Japanese confectionery shop?”</p>
<p>“Because my favorite food is dorayaki. Eating dorayaki with the person I like would probably be special.”</p>

<p>So Seto-san likes dorayaki that much. It seems to me that her eyes are shining a bit more than usual.</p>
<p>I briefly consider telling Toshiya about this later, but I have a feeling that Toshiya, who has known Seto-san for over a year, already knows this information.</p>

<p>“Then, where would you want to go with the person you like, Hondo-kun?”</p>

<p>A place I’d want to go with the person I like, huh?</p>
<p>It seems better to think from the perspective of what I’d want to do with them.</p>
<p>I’d be happy if I could cook with the person I like. So, the place I’d want to go is…</p>

<p>“Probably the supermarket.”</p>
<p>“The reason?”</p>
<p>“I’d like to cook with the person I like. And for that, we’d need to go shopping first, I guess?”</p>
<p>“That makes sense—so the supermarket it is.”</p>
<p>“Is that weird?”</p>

<p>I suddenly felt anxious that my answer might not be what she expected.</p>

<p>“I don’t know if it’s common, but I don’t think it’s weird.”</p>
<p>“Then that’s good.”</p>
<p>“That was an interesting answer though. Let’s make the next topic about what you’d like to do with the person you like, like you mentioned earlier.”</p>

<p>It seems the conversation has moved on to the next topic while I was feeling relieved.</p>

<p>“I’d be happy if they made me a homemade bento, but what about you, Seto-san? What would you like them to do?”</p>
<p>“…Is anything alright?”</p>
<p>“As long as it’s within the bounds of common sense, I think it’s fine.”</p>

<p>I wonder what Seto-san wants him to do to her.</p>
<p>After about ten seconds of silence, filled with apparent internal conflict, Seto-san speaks again.</p>

<p>“…I’d like to have my head gently stroked.”</p>

<p>Seto-san says this in a voice that sounds as if she’s mustering all her courage.</p>
<p>I wonder if it was my imagination that Seto-san’s ears seemed to be a little redder than before</p>

<p>“Is that strange?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not strange at all.”</p>

<p>So Seto-san wants Toshiya to stroke her head?</p>
<p>It seems that Seto-san trusts Toshiya more than I thought.</p>
<p>As someone who’s rooting for Toshiya’s love life, this genuinely makes me happy.</p>

<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>If Seto-san were to ask, Toshiya would probably stroke his head.</p>
<p>But it seems Seto-san can’t say it directly and so she mentioned it as something she’d like to have done.</p>
<p>The whole situation gives me a sense of frustration.</p>

<p>“Do you have anything else you’d want to do with the person you like, Hondo-kun? Like sharing a hobby, for example.”</p>
<p>“A hobby….”</p>
<p>“To begin with, what is your hobby?”</p>
<p>“Um, I guess watching anime.”</p>
<p>“What kind of anime do you watch?”</p>

<p>Seto-san seems more interested than I thought she’d be.</p>

<p>“I often watch anime that my little sister wants to see.”</p>
<p>“You have a little sister? And you watch anime together? Sounds like you two are close.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>I don’t know much about other people’s siblings, so I can’t tell if we’re especially close.</p>

<p>“I think so. Anyway, what kind of anime do you watch with your sister?”</p>
<p>“We recently watched an anime movie together called ’21 Gram of Difference.’ “</p>
<p>” ’21 Gram of Difference’? What’s that about?”</p>
<p>“It’s a romance anime. To give you a quick synopsis…”</p>

<p>The main character is a boy who has a childhood friend.</p>
<p>He falls in love with her, but she dies due to an illness when they’re in middle school. Thus, her death leaves him leading a listless life.</p>
<p>Then one day, the younger sister of the girl he loved shows up, claiming to be her deceased sister.</p>

<p>“What does that mean? Did the older sister’s spirit transfer into her younger sister’s body?”</p>
<p>“That’s what she said, yes.”</p>
<p>“I see, and then what happens?”</p>
<p>“If I say any more, it’ll be a major spoiler. Is that okay? I mean, it’s fine if you don’t plan on watching it.”</p>

<p>Seto-san covers her mouth with her hand, apparently pondering whether to watch the anime or not.</p>

<p>“…I’m curious, so I’d like to watch it.”</p>
<p>“In that case, I won’t say any more about it.”</p>
<p>“Thank you…I think we’re going off-topic.”</p>
<p>“The original topic was what we’d like to do with someone we’re interested in, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct. Hondo-kun, don’t you want to watch anime with someone you’re interested in?”</p>

<p>I’d never thought about that before.</p>
<p>I try to picture the scenario in my head.</p>

<p>“…It does sound fun to watch the same anime with someone I’m interested in and share our thoughts.”</p>
<p>“I guess so… I think I’d also enjoy discussing my favorite books with someone I’m interested in.”</p>

<p>I wish Seto-san would tell that directly to Toshiya.</p>
<p>If she did that, Toshiya would probably read even the thickest book in a single day.</p>



<p>“It seems nice to be able to talk about hobbies with someone you’re interested in.”</p>
<p>“I think so too…”</p>

<p>While Seto-san is speaking, the door bursts open with great force.</p>

<p>“Hey everyone, are we all doing well today?!”</p>
<p>“Could you open the door a bit more quietly?”</p>

<p>Turning toward the door, I see the energetic Ai-san and a weary-looking Yousuke-san.</p>

<p>“Hello, Ai-san, Yousuke-san.”</p>
<p>“Hello, Daiki-kun! You look well, that’s great! Mio-chan looks the same as always!”</p>
<p>“Ai-senpai, keep quiet.”</p>
<p>“Mio-chan, you should be a bit kinder to your senpai, you know?”</p>

<p>As Ai-san says this, she quickly moves toward the sleeping Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Hey there, sleepyhead princess, time to wake up. Ah, does the princess need a prince’s kiss to wake up? Oh well, it can’t be helped…”</p>
<p>“Who’s a sleepyhead?”</p>

<p>At that moment, Shimizu-san woke up and covered Ai-san’s mouth swiftly with one hand.”</p>

<p>“Mmff, mmph!”</p>

<p>It’s not clear what Ai-san is trying to say, but it’s obvious that she’s struggling desperately.</p>

<p>“Let her go, Kei.”</p>
<p>“…it can’t be helped.”</p>

<p>Persuaded by Yousuke-san, Shimizu-san removes her hand from Ai-san’s mouth.</p>

<p>“Phew, I almost lost my life… Thanks, Yousuke. You’re the kindest childhood friend I’ve ever had!”</p>
<p>“I think it would have been better if I had left it blocked.”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to block your mouth too?”</p>
<p>“Wait! There’s an important announcement today, so let me speak! You can zip my mouth shut after that!”</p>
<p>“An important announcement?”</p>

<p>What on earth is Ai-san planning to say?</p>

<p>“Yes, in fact, there are two major announcements today!”</p>
<p>“Then hurry up and say it.”</p>
<p>“Kei, you’re so impatient. But I don’t want to keep everyone in suspense, so I’ll get right to it!”</p>
<p>“Nobody is that excited, you know.”</p>

<p>Ai-san is always high-spirited, but today she seems even more so than usual.</p>
<p>What could she be planning to announce?</p>

<p>“First off! Our Astronomy Enthusiast Club is now officially the Astronomy Club!”</p>
<p>“Congratulations, Ai-senpai.”</p>

<p>Seto-san claps quietly without changing her expression.</p>

<p>“Congratulations, that was quick.”</p>
<p>“We worked hard, especially Yousuke!”</p>
<p>“Don’t sound so proud. Well, it’s already more than two weeks since Hondō-kun and Kei first came here, and we already had members and a faculty advisor, so things went fairly smoothly.”</p>

<p>So he was working behind the scenes to establish the Astronomy Club while also performing his duties as the student council president.</p>
<p>No wonder he was rarely in the club room.</p>

<p>“Now that we’ve become the Astronomy Club, we can do more than when we were just an enthusiast group!”</p>
<p>“The budget for this year probably won’t be allocated yet, so we can’t purchase equipment immediately.”</p>
<p>“That’s a minor issue!”</p>
<p>“Um… there’s something I’ve been curious about. Can I ask?”</p>
<p>“What is it, Daiki-kun? Go ahead and ask your senpai.”</p>

<p>Ai-san fluttered her hair as she said that for some reason.</p>

<p>“Don’t physically make your hair flutter like that, senpai.”</p>
<p>“I’ve been wondering for a while, who’s our faculty advisor?”</p>
<p>“Come to think of it, I haven’t mentioned that yet. It’s a teacher that you, Daiki-kun, Kei, and Mio-chan all know.”</p>

<p>A teacher we know?</p>
<p>I have no idea who it could be since I don’t remember which teachers are in charge of which clubs.</p>

<p>“Stop beating around the bush and tell us.”</p>
<p>“I agree with Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“I can’t keep the ladies waiting. Okay, I’ll tell you! Our advisor is Yuasa-sensei.”</p>
<p>“Yuasa? Are you serious…?”</p>

<p>Yuasa-sensei is our class’s homeroom teacher. He’s a male teacher in charge of math classes.</p>
<p>He’s been the homeroom teacher for my class, which includes Shimizu-san and Seto-san, since our freshman year.</p>

<p>“Yeah, totally serious. When I told him that Kei would join the club, Yuasa-sensei was so moved that he immediately agreed.”</p>
<p>“Don’t use me as bait!”</p>

<p>Yuasa-sensei is a kind and good teacher, but he’s a bit of a crybaby.</p>
<p>He’s particularly concerned about Shimizu-san, who is known as a ‘yankee,’ and can even tear up just seeing her attend class normally.</p>
<p>That’s why Shimizu-san finds him a bit annoying.</p>

<p>“If Yuasa-sensei becomes our advisor, it’ll make us happy, and he’ll feel relieved seeing Kei enjoy the club activities. See, it’s a win-win for everyone!”</p>
<p>“I’m not included in that everyone win-win scenario.”</p>
<p>“Eh, but Kei is also with Hon———”</p>
<p>“Do you want me to shut your mouth again?”</p>

<p>Before Ai-san could finish her sentence, Shimizu-san interjected with the lowest voice she had used today.</p>

<p>“Wait. I’m very smart, so I’ll keep quiet.”</p>
<p>“Someone who’s really smart wouldn’t speak so carelessly in the first place. So, what’s the second big announcement?”</p>
<p>“Ah, right. I haven’t said it yet. The second big announcement is… (Drumroll)… Surprise! We’ve secured conditional permission for stargazing on the rooftop! (Applause)…”</p>

<p>I remember Ai-san had previously mentioned that one reason she wanted Shimizu-san and me to join was so we could stargaze from the rooftop.</p>
<p>I didn’t expect that to become a reality so quickly.</p>
<p>Ai-san and Yousuke-san must have worked hard behind the scenes.</p>

<p>“That’s great, but what are the conditions?”</p>
<p>“About that… Yousuke, you tell them!”</p>
<p>“Why are you suddenly throwing it to me? Well, it’s fine. The conditions are related to the upcoming midterm exams.”</p>
<p>“So we need to get good grades on the midterms?”</p>
<p>“You’re close. To be precise, the condition is that everyone in the Astronomy Club must rank within the top 40 overall in the upcoming midterm exams.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that a pretty strict condition?”</p>

<p>Our high school has over 200 students in each grade.</p>
<p>I think aiming for the top 40 for everyone seems quite difficult.</p>

<p>“The Astronomy Club is a newly established club. That’s why we needed to meet conditions like this to get permission to stargaze on the rooftop at night. So, I want you to study harder than usual for the exams.”</p>
<p>“Yes, we need to work hard!”</p>
<p>“Especially you, Ai. I’m talking to you.”</p>

<p>I thought it was a joke to lighten the mood, but Yousuke-san’s expression was unusually grim.</p>


<p>“Why? I don’t usually get scores that are anywhere near failing!”</p>
<p>“That’s because I’m always trying my best to teach you when you come crying to me a week before the exams!”</p>
<p>“Hey Yousuke, you’re talking too loud! I’m supposed to be the beautiful and gentle Senpai that the juniors can count on! You’re ruining my reputation!”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, you already lost any chance of being relied upon by the juniors.”</p>
<p>“That’s harsh! That’s not true, right, Kei?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san stubbornly avoids meeting Ai-san’s gaze.</p>

<p>“Kei-san? Did Onee-chan do something wrong? Why won’t you make eye contact?”</p>

<p>There was no response to Ai-san’s question.</p>

<p>“Ah, Kei, you’re always so stubborn. Mio-chan thinks of me as a kind and reliable Senpai, you know——”</p>
<p>“No.”</p>
<p>“An immediate answer!? Can’t you at least let me finish?”</p>
<p>“There’s no point in listening when the answer is already decided.”</p>
<p>“Ugh… That’s a sharp blow. If it weren’t for my strong mentality, I’d have collapsed. Mio-chan, I know you only say that because you’re shy… Daiki-kun, at least you think of me as a kind, cheerful, and elegant Senpai you can rely on, right?”</p>

<p>Ai-san’s eyes had already lost their sparkle, and overwhelming emptiness was staring back at me.</p>
<p>All I could do right now was…</p>

<p>“Ahaha…”</p>
<p>“Daiki-kun?”</p>

<p>My awkward, forced smile was the most affirming thing I could muster at that moment.</p>

<p>“My spirit is about to break… Yousuke, you’ll be kind to me, right?”</p>

<p>Tears seemed to float in Ai-san’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Don’t look at me with those puppy-dog eyes all of a sudden… Well, you do occasionally consider others and not just yourself, so in a broader sense, I guess you can be considered kind?”</p>

<p>The moment she heard that, Ai-san’s face lit up, and she enthusiastically hugged Yousuke-san.</p>

<p>“The only one who praises me is Yousuke. Keep praising me forever!”</p>
<p>“Don’t hug me out of nowhere! I get it, let go!”</p>

<p>Yousuke-san tries to peel Ai-san off him.</p>
<p>I’ve never seen him so flustered.</p>

<p>“I know you’re happy——”</p>
<p>“You’re forgetting we have juniors here! The one who’s going to be embarrassed later is you!”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>

<p>Ai-san quickly steps away from Yousuke-san.</p>
<p>Then her face gradually turns red.</p>

<p>“Forget what you just saw, everyone! And for the record, I don’t just hug anyone!”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I’ve got it all memorized.”</p>
<p>“Mio-chan? I just said to forget it, didn’t I? That’s not okay, you know?”</p>
<p>“To erase memories, a convenience store exclusive matcha dorayaki is required.”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to threaten me?”</p>
<p>“Just kidding. But it’s good to remember for future reference.”</p>
<p>“Mio-chan, you’re a scary girl…”</p>
<p>“What kind of skit are you two doing?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san interjects with an exasperated expression.</p>

<p>“Alright, everyone, let’s study hard for the exams! And that concludes the important announcement! Let’s just chat aimlessly as usual!”</p>
<p>“Aren’t we supposed to be studying for the exams?”</p>
<p>“That’s something we’ll get serious about starting tomorrow.”</p>
<p>“That sounds like something someone who doesn’t study until the last minute would say.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, when I need to, I can be a very productive human. So, what were Mio-chan and Daiki-kun talking about before we arrived?”</p>
<p>“About that…”</p>

<p>I reflexively glance over at Seto-san, who silently shakes her head.</p>
<p>Apparently, she wants to keep our earlier love talk a secret from Ai-san and Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“…We were discussing my recommended anime.”</p>

<p>With this explanation, Ai-san and Shimizu-san shouldn’t suspect that we were talking about love.</p>

<p>“Oh really, what anime did you watch?”</p>
<p>“It’s an anime movie called ’21 Gram of Difference.’ “</p>
<p>“Ah, I’ve seen that too! It’s a great anime, isn’t it? I was really moved.”</p>

<p>It’s easy to imagine Ai-san being moved by that anime.</p>

<p>“I mean, in the last scene, the protagonist was——”</p>

<p>Ai-san’s mouth is quickly covered by Seto-san’s hand.</p>

<p>“No spoilers allowed.”</p>
<p>“Mmmffh…mmmhh.”</p>
<p>“…okay. I’ll take my hand off.”</p>

<p>I wonder if Seto-san understood what Ai-san was trying to say.</p>

<p>“Phew, I can finally breathe. If you haven’t watched it yet, Mio-chan, you should’ve said something.”</p>
<p>“You started talking before I could, Ai-senpai.”</p>
<p>“…True. Sorry about that. You were discussing ’21 Gram of Difference,’ huh? It’s a good work, so I definitely want Mio-chan to watch it.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I’m looking forward to it.”</p>
<p>“That’s a good response. Let’s talk about what you think of it once you’ve seen it!”</p>

<p>After that, the day’s Astronomy Club meeting was entirely consumed by discussions of favorite anime and manga.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>When I arrived in the classroom the next day, Shimizu-san hadn’t come to school yet.</p>

<p>“Hey Daiki, good morning.”</p>

<p>Turning toward the voice, I see Toshiya standing there.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Toshiya. Is morning practice over already?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, we finished a bit earlier than usual today.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“But I heard, Daiki. The Astronomy Enthusiast Club has now become the Astronomy Club. That’s great.”</p>
<p>“Where did you get that information?”</p>

<p>Why does Toshiya know about something Ai-san had just told us yesterday?</p>

<p>“I heard it from Seto-san.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“Still, you’re lucky, getting to be in a club activity with Seto-san…”</p>

<p>Toshiya genuinely seems envious.</p>

<p>“I hadn’t really talked to her much before, but Seto-san is an interesting person, isn’t she?”</p>
<p>“So you’ve finally realized it, Daiki… The joy of talking to Seto-san. it… the joy of talking with Seto-san. It feels both happy and a little lonely… So what Daiki and Seto-san usually talk about?”</p>
<p>“Um…”</p>

<p>I can’t really say that Seto-san and I have been discussing whether her feelings toward Toshiya are romantic.</p>
<p>While I’m pondering my answer, I hear the back door of the classroom open.</p>
<p>Looking over, I see Shimizu-san walking into the room.</p>

<p>“Sorry, I have to go. We’ll continue this later.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Ah, okay.”</p>

<p>Toshiya suddenly said that and quickly returns to his seat.</p>
<p>And as Toshiya leaves, Shimizu-san comes closer to where I am.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“….Morning.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san seems less energetic than usual today for some reason.</p>

<p>“Is something wrong, Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“…Why all of a sudden? Nothing’s wrong.”</p>

<p>She seems not as strong as usual.</p>
<p>Even her intimidating gaze seems to lack its usual intensity.</p>

<p>Focusing on Shimizu-san’s eyes, I notice something—her eyes are slightly swollen.</p>
<p>While there could be multiple reasons for swollen eyes, the most likely one is wiping away tears.</p>
<p>So it would be reasonable to assume that Shimizu-san has been crying.</p>
<p>The question is, why has Shimizu-san been crying? What could have possibly happened to her?</p>

<p>“Are you sure nothing’s wrong? If you have any problems, I’m here to listen.”</p>
<p>“I said there’s nothing wrong… I’m going to sleep now, so don’t wake me up.”</p>
<p>“I’ll only wake you up If Sensei comes in.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to wake me up…”</p>

<p>With that, Shimizu-san falls asleep.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, the day ended without Shimizu-san regaining her usual energy.</p>


<p>Why did Shimizu-san cry?</p>
<p>Even after returning home, I kept thinking about it in my room.</p>
<p>Was it because she was still shocked by what that Senpai had told her when he confessed before?</p>
<p>Or was there something that hurt her in a way that I did not know at all?</p>

<p>“Onii-chan.”</p>

<p>I’m startled by the knock and voice coming from the door.</p>
<p>I wonder how long I’ve been pondering about Shimizu-san. I hurry to open the door.</p>
<p>Waiting for me on the other side is the owner of the voice, my sister Teruno.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Let’s watch anime.”</p>
<p>“Sure, what do you want to watch?”</p>
<p>” ’21 Gram of Difference.’ “</p>

<p>It’s not unusual for Teruno to want to watch anime with me.</p>
<p>However, there was one thing that caught my attention.</p>

<p>“We watched ‘The 21 Gram Difference’ together not too long ago, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>Teruno makes a slightly displeased face.</p>

<p>“We did, but I want to watch it again.”</p>
<p>“Alright, come in.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>

<p>Either way, I wouldn’t get an immediate answer even if I kept thinking.</p>
<p>So, it seems better to just grant Teruno’s request for now. I welcome Teruno into my room.</p>
<p>It was my second time watching ’21 Gram of Difference,’ so I already knew the overall flow.</p>
<p>Still, it was a good anime that was worth watching again.</p>

<p>“Onii-chan.”</p>

<p>Teruno speaks to me as the anime finishes.</p>

<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Why are you playing with my hair?”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>

img here

<p>Apparently, I had been unconsciously playing with Teruno’s hair.</p>

<p>“Sorry. I was lost in thought.”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. So, how have things been lately?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“How’s your club activity going?”</p>

<p>I’ve already told Teruno that I joined the Astronomy Club.</p>
<p>So her question wasn’t out of nowhere, but it was a bit sudden, so I was slightly surprised.</p>

<p>“Um, I just joined, but it’s fun.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, both the Senpai and classmates are kind.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>

<p>For some reason, Teruno seemed dissatisfied.</p>
<p>She didn’t say anything more and left my room.</p>

<p>“What was that about?”</p>

<p>I can’t think of anything that might have triggered her reaction.</p>
<p>Puzzled, I went back to thinking about why Shimizu-san had cried.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The next day after school, I was thinking about how to approach Shimizu-san in the Astronomy Club room.</p>
<p>Currently, it was just Shimizu-san and me in the clubroom, and she was silently fiddling with her phone.</p>
<p>The area around her eyes was still a bit swollen.</p>

<p>I had spent the entire day thinking about why Shimizu-san had cried, and although I had some ideas, none seemed convincing enough.</p>

<p>“It looks like Seto-san, Ai-san, and Yousuke-san haven’t arrived yet.”</p>

<p>After thinking it over, I decided to start the conversation with something casual.</p>

<p>“Seto is on library duty, and Ai and Yousuke are probably in the student council.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, it’ll probably be a while before any of them get here.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>The conversation stalls.</p>
<p>Have our conversations always been like this?</p>
<p>At this rate, I’ll never find out why Shimizu-san had been crying.</p>
<p>I resolve to get to the point.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, may I have a word with you?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, you’re getting all formal?”</p>
<p>“I have something I want to ask you.”</p>
<p>“Go ahead.”</p>
<p>“What happened to the swelling around your eyes, Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“Wha—”</p>

<p>For some reason, Shimizu-san’s face slowly starts to redden.</p>

<p>“Did something happen? If you’re in trouble, I want you to tell me.”</p>
<p>“I’m not in trouble, and even if I were, it’s none of your business!”</p>

<p>I can’t believe that nothing happened because Shimizu-san is clearly flustered.</p>

<p>“It does matter. If Shimizu-san is sad, then I’m sad too.”</p>
<p>“Hondo…”</p>
<p>“That’s why I want you to tell me what’s on your mind, Shimizu-san. I’ll do whatever I can to help you.”</p>

<p>I cover Shimizu-san’s hand with both of mine.</p>

<p>“Y-your… your hands… and saying you’ll do ‘anything,’ don’t say things like that so lightly…”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san’s face reddens even more than before.</p>

<p>“It’s not ‘lightly’! Shimizu-san is important to me. I hate that I can’t do anything if you’re troubled.”</p>

<p>A loud noise reverberates throughout the room.</p>
<p>Reflexively, I look in the direction of the noise, which seems to have come from the door.</p>
<p>Upon closer inspection, the door is slightly ajar.</p>
<p>Noticing this, Shimizu-san forcefully pulls my hands away.</p>

<p>“Hey, whoever’s there, come out.”</p>

<p>After a few seconds, the door slowly opens.</p>
<p>The person standing there is the one and only Ai-san.</p>

<p>“When did you start watching?”</p>
<p>“Eh? I just got here; I don’t know anything.”</p>
<p>“Don’t lie. Tell the truth.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san glares at Ai-san as a crease forms between her brows.</p>

<p>“I’ve been here since Daiki-kun said that no one else hasn’t arrived yet!”</p>
<p>“So you’ve been here from the beginning?”</p>
<p>“Well, I thought it might be rude to interrupt your time alone.”</p>
<p>“What’s your real motive?”</p>
<p>“I thought something interesting might happen if I observed you two from a distance.”</p>
<p>“Hey!”</p>

<p>It seems that without knowing it, both Shimizu-san and I had become the subjects of Ai-san’s observation.</p>

<p>“Anyway, let’s set that aside for a moment. Kei, maybe you could tell Daiki-kun why your eyes are swollen? He seemed genuinely concerned.”</p>
<p>“Ai-san, do you know why?”</p>
<p>“Of course, I saw Kei crying.”</p>

<p>What’s going on here?</p>
<p>Despite knowing that Shimizu-san was crying, Ai-san seems unfazed.</p>

<p>“Hey, don’t say that without my permission.”</p>
<p>“Then you can tell him yourself, Kei.”</p>
<p>“Fine… I get it.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. You don’t have to say it if you don’t want to.”</p>

<p>I’m genuinely curious, but I don’t want to pressure Shimizu-san into revealing anything.</p>

<p>“Hey, don’t say that without my permission.”</p>
<p>“Then you can tell him yourself, Kei.”</p>
<p>“Ugh… I get it.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay. You don’t have to say it if you don’t want to.”</p>

<p>I’m genuinely curious, but I don’t want to pressure Shimizu-san into revealing anything.</p>

<p>“…It’s fine. It’s not something I need to hide. Just don’t tell anyone else.”</p>
<p>“Of course, I won’t say anything to anyone else…”</p>
<p>“Good, the reason my eyes are swollen is because I watched…”</p>

<p>Her voice trailed off towards the end, making it difficult to catch what she said.</p>

<p>“Sorry, Shimizu-san, could you say that again?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san takes a slow, deep breath and opens her mouth wide.</p>

<p>“…It’s because I watched ’21 Gram of Difference’! “</p>
<p>“…what?”</p>

<p>I never expected that ’21 Gram of Difference would come up at this moment.</p>
<p>While I’m standing there dumbfounded, Ai-san starts giggling next to Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Kei suddenly started crying a lot when we watched ’21 Gram of Difference’ together. I was really surprised at the time.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to go into detail! I just let my guard down and shed a few tears.”</p>
<p>“A few? I thought your tear ducts had exploded or something.”</p>
<p>“Stop saying unnecessary things! Hondō will get the wrong idea!”</p>

<p>As far as getting the wrong idea goes, I think it’s a fact that Shimizu-san cried while watching ’21 Gram of Difference’.</p>
<p>I felt a sense of relief and slowly rested my face on the desk after hearing what Shimizu-san and Ai-san had to say.</p>


<p>“Thank goodness.”</p>
<p>“What’s going on all of a sudden? And what are you relieved about?”</p>
<p>“I had been worried because Shimizu-san’s eyes were swollen. I thought something sad might have happened, but it’s good to know that wasn’t the case.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“I’m glad Shimizu-san wasn’t feeling sad somewhere without me knowing.”</p>
<p>“I-I see…”</p>
<p>“Your face is all flushed, how cute. You forgot to say, ‘Thanks for worrying about me, Daiki-kun,’ young lady.”</p>
<p>“Who are you calling a young lady?”</p>

<p>Feeling relieved by Ai-san and Shimizu-san’s typical comedic banter, I hear the door open again.</p>
<p>Looking toward the door, it turns out Seto-san has arrived.</p>

<p>“Hello.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Mio-chan. You’re a bit late.”</p>
<p>“I was asking Sensei about parts I didn’t understand in class.”</p>
<p>“I see. Well, have a seat.”</p>
<p>“I will.”</p>

<p>Seto-san takes a seat in an empty chair.</p>

<p>“What were you all talking about?”</p>
<p>“We were talking about ’21 Gram of Difference.’ Shimizu-san has seen it too.”</p>

<p>This way, Seto-san wouldn’t know that Shimizu-san cried while watching ’21 Gram of Difference’.</p>

<p>“I watched it yesterday too.”</p>
<p>“So Mio-chan saw it as well. Did you find it interesting?”</p>
<p>“I think it was interesting.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear. What about you, Kei? What did you think about the protagonist’s confession at the last scene?”</p>
<p>“Why are you asking me that out of the blue?”</p>
<p>“Just curious?”</p>
<p>“That’s too random. Well, I think it’s good that they ended up together.”</p>
<p>“Exactly. I was really happy when they finally got together. Would you like to be confessed like that too, Kei?”</p>
<p>“Ha? What are you suddenly talking about!”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san looks visibly rattled by the unexpected question.</p>

<p>“Don’t we all dream of being confessed to by someone we like at least once? I was just wondering what that would be like for you, Kei. You’re curious too, right Daiki-kun?”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“You’re curious, right?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes.”</p>

<p>The pressure from Ai-san was intense, making me reflexively reply.</p>
<p>But indeed, I am curious about what kind of confession Shimizu-san would idealize.</p>

<p>“Come on, Kei. Tell Daiki-kun. If you were to be confessed to, how would you like it to happen?”</p>
<p>“Well, that is…”</p>
<p>“That is?”</p>
<p>“That is…”</p>

<p>Everyone’s eyes are on Shimizu-san, then our eyes meet.</p>
<p>Although her eyes seem to be saying something, unfortunately, I can’t figure out what Shimizu-san wants to express.</p>
<p>After a few seconds pass, Shimizu-san suddenly grabs her bag and dashes out the door.</p>

<p>“Wait, Kei-san, are you planning to run away!”</p>
<p>“I’m not running away! I’m just tired of confessions; even if it happens, I won’t be happy! I have nothing more to say today, so I’m leaving!”</p>

<p>Saying this, Shimizu-san vanished down the hallway.</p>

<p>“Damn, she got away. I underestimated Kei’s agility.”</p>

<p>Ai-san seems frustrated as if she let a fleeing criminal escape.</p>

<p>“But she did say she’s tired of confessions, didn’t she?”</p>
<p>“It’s a little different. She might not like confessions from strangers, but if it’s from someone she likes, even Kei would be happy.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“I think so. Though it might be difficult for you to understand, Mio-chan.”</p>
<p>“Hmph.”</p>

<p>Seto-san responds with a ‘hmph,’ but her expression remains unchanged.</p>

<p>“Even so, wasting such a golden opportunity, my dear little sister still has a lot to learn.”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“Don’t mind it, just talking to myself. Anyway, let’s continue our conversation.”</p>

<p>Then we spent the rest of the time until we went home discussing our thoughts on ’21 Gram of Difference.’</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“Why does this always happen to me…”</p>

<p>At night, lying on her bed, I mumbled to myself.</p>

<p>“Even though I had a chance to talk about it with Hondō…”</p>

<p>Hondō had mentioned that he would be happy to talk about anime together, so it was good that I decided to watch ’21 Gram of Difference’ with Ai.</p>
<p>The problem was that I got more emotionally invested in the anime than I anticipated.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, I was rooting for the heroine, and tears flowed by the end.</p>

<p>(It can’t be helped that anyone will cry after seeing her brave figure.)</p>

<p>The puffiness around my eyes hadn’t subsided even after a night, and Hondō had noticed right away, causing him unnecessary concern.</p>
<p>I thought Hondō would forget about it after a day.</p>

<p>(I didn’t expect him to be so concerned about me…)</p>

<p>Hondō was far more attentive than I had assumed.</p>
<p>Why was Hondō so kind to someone like me? She was on the verge of getting the wrong idea.</p>

<p>(No, I’m sure he is kind to everyone.)</p>

<p>I can’t say that’s a bad thing, but it makes me feel a little lonely.</p>
<p>How selfish, even though I’m supposed to like kind-hearted Hondō, just the thought of him being kind to someone else makes my chest tighten.</p>
<p>I started to dislike myself.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to sigh, the door to my room burst open vigorously.</p>

<p>“Ta-daaa! Onee-sama has arrived!”</p>

<p>The chain of negative thoughts inside my head was forcibly broken by the appearance of this big idiot.</p>

<p>“…sigh.”</p>
<p>“Won’t you say something? Onee-chan came because she was worried about you!”</p>
<p>“Shut up, I don’t need you worrying about me.”</p>
<p>“That’s a lie! You were feeling a bit down after recalling what happened in the Astronomy Club today, weren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Guuu…”</p>

<p>How does my sister always know what I’m thinking?</p>

<p>“Hit the mark, didn’t I? Why not talk to me and lighten your load?”</p>
<p>“I refuse. Go back to your room.”</p>
<p>“Well then, given the time, I’ll just say what I want to say.”</p>
<p>“Uh, okay.”</p>

<p>It’s unusual for Ai to actually listen to my request, so it throws me off a bit.</p>

<p>“Today, I became sure of it after seeing Kei and Daiki-kun talking together. Daiki-kun really cherishes Kei. Daiki-kun is deeply infatuated with Kei!”</p>
<p>“…What?”</p>
<p>“Alright, I said what I wanted to say. I’m leaving. See you next time!”</p>
<p>“Wait a minut—”</p>

<p>Before I could hold her back, Ai left the room with a satisfied look on her face.</p>

<p>“What does she even mean by ‘deeply infatuated’…”</p>

<p>Lost in my thoughts, there was no one left to give me an answer.</p>

<p>***<br />TN: Idk if it’s a real anime movie, but 21 grams probably refers to the human soul. Someone attempted to measure the weight of the human soul and claimed an average weight loss of 21 grams at the moment of death.</p>
