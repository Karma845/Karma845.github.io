<h1>Chapter 3: Exposing the Sins</h1>

<p>The next day, after dawn, I was sitting in a room at the adventurers’ guild.</p>
<p>The seats were arranged in a “コ” shape, and in front of me were the four members of the “Falcon Sword.”</p>
<p>The guild receptionist was seated on one side.</p>
<p>This room is located at the back of the guild hall, and the disturbances from the adventurers barely reach here.</p>
<p>It’s probably a place used for meetings with important individuals in the guild.</p>
<p>If it were my former self, I would be sitting here with hunched shoulders, but now I was sitting with crossed legs.</p>
<p>The victim was confronting the perpetrators, and from the beginning, I was very optimistic.</p>
<p>“…..So, Sora-sama, you won’t withdraw the accusation that ‘Falcon Sword’ deliberately attacked you, right?”</p>
<p>“I’ve been saying that for a while now. Don’t make me repeat it,” I snorted at the receptionist’s words and pointed to the four people at the table.</p>
<p>“‘Falcon Sword’ used me as bait to escape. They carefully used lethal magic to prevent me from moving. I have no intention of withdrawing this accusation. Besides, why should I withdraw it? They haven’t denied it, have they?”</p>
<p>“That’s true. But whenever there’s a discrepancy between the testimonies of both parties, it must be confirmed.”</p>
<p>“Then, confirm it. I don’t need to withdraw anything for that.”</p>
<p>Upon saying that, the receptionist fell silent. By the way, this receptionist is the same person who declared my expulsion the other day.</p>
<p>It was Lars who spoke up instead of the speechless receptionist.</p>
<p>“…..Sora.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“Did Miro really shoot you with magic? It’s hard to believe.”</p>
<p>Lars looked at me with a suspicious gaze. At that moment, Lars had fainted from the lord of the flies’s attack and was carried away by the warrior priestess Iria.</p>
<p>So, he didn’t witness it with his own eyes. I shrugged at Lars’ question.</p>
<p>“I don’t need you to believe me. I mean, ask the culprit herself before asking me.”</p>
<p>“Miro admitted to using magic, but she said she didn’t intend to attack you. Didn’t the magic she cast towards the lord of the flies just bring you bad luck?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing that, I burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“Hahaha! By bad luck, you mean? As expected from the great leader of the C-rank group ‘Falcon Sword,’ that’s some great reasoning!”</p>
<p>As I intentionally clapped my hands, Lars’ face turned red. Additionally, Miroslav and Iria looked at me with murderous eyes, but I laughed at their reactions.</p>
<p>“In that case, I have a question for the great leader. At that time, you were being chased by the lord of the flies, and I was standing in that direction.”</p>
<p>From Miroslav’s point of view, the monster was behind and I was in front.</p>
<p>Taking this into account, how can a mistake be made from that position? Did the magic she cast unexpectedly fly backward? Are you serious? Not even a child would make that mistake.”</p>
<p>When I laughed, Lars bit his lips in frustration. Then, the receptionist frowned and spoke up.</p>
<p>“Sora-sama, this is not a place for condemning a person. It’s a place to verify each party’s claims and go the right way. Please don’t intentionally harm others.”</p>
<p>“I apologize for that. I didn’t know it was such a noble place. I thought it was a place that wants to quickly settle one’s claims to protect the high-ranking adventurers who are important to the guild.”</p>
<p>“…..Are you trying to insult the guild?”</p>
<p>“If it’s different, then decide on the disposition for them. At first, guild tell me to withdraw my accusation, then guild warn me about my tone. That’s why I’m getting that kind of impression.”</p>
<p>Right now, I’m delivering a good blow to the person who declared my expulsion from the adventurers’ guild the other day. Unable to respond, that person pursed their lips. Seeing that, the corners of my mouth lifted.</p>
<p>To be honest… it feels really good!</p>
<p>The fact that my expulsion from the adventurers’ guild is in accordance with the rules is also on me.</p>
<p>However, I haven’t forgotten the receptionist’s attitude at that time. And being able to leave them speechless boosts my spirits.</p>
<p>And as they looked at me in that way, Iria opened her mouth with bitterness.</p>
<p>“All you’re doing is making demands. But what exactly do you want us to do? Will you be satisfied if we all bow our heads to the ground?”</p>
<p>“What’s with those words? Don’t speak for yourself. On my part, I don’t mind if you appeal to the temple. I can say that your priest used another person as bait to save their own life.”</p>
<p>In response to that, I crossed my arms thoughtfully.</p>
<p>“…..No, wait. It’s better that way. There must be a priest in the temple who can use the miracle ‘Lie Detection,’ and with that, it will be known whether my words are lies or not. It’s better than continuing with these stupid questions and answers in this place.”</p>





<p>Upon hearing that, Iria’s expression changed. Seeing me rise with a smile, Iria tried to say something. But someone spoke up before her. It was Miroslav.</p>
<p>“Wait! I was the one who shot you with magic! The others had nothing to do with it.”</p>
<p>“They had nothing to do with it? They didn’t help the victim when their comrade deliberately attacked me. Instead, they managed to escape by luck while the other became live prey. And you say they had nothing to do with it? You say some amusing things, ‘Murderer.'”</p>
<p>As a gift to those who coined the nickname ‘Parasite,’ I’ll give them a new nickname. Miroslav twisted his handsome face, probably realizing my intention.</p>
<p>Of course, I didn’t care about that and continued my attack.</p>
<p>“From what I heard, it seems like all of you attacked me. Something like ‘Unfortunately, the lord of the flies’s attention shifted to a civilian who was there.’ HA! A mage, an elf, a priestess. Did you all agree to cast the magic?”</p>
<p>“…..Huh! In the first place, even adventurers would run away. Two people clinging to one plank won’t survive!”</p>
<p>What Miroslav said was an old narrative. When a member of a crew from a ship that had sunk in a storm struggled to survive, a plank from the ship floated near him.</p>
<p>Thanks to that, he stayed afloat, but then another sailor came and asked if he could also stay on the plank.</p>
<p>However, the plank was small and could only support one person. If both clung to the same plank, they would both sink. The sailor who first grabbed the plank inevitably rejected the second sailor’s request, and as a result, that sailor drowned.</p>
<p>Time passed, and the sailor who was rescued confessed the circumstances and was accused of murder, but was acquitted in a trial…. Miroslav added her actions to this narrative. I laughed at his nose.</p>
<p>“Lars, did you hear it? It’s clear that she used the emergency evacuation as an excuse to attack me. This is what they say about falling on your own words.”</p>
<p>“…Ah”</p>
<p>“…Miro”</p>
<p>“L-Lars, I’m sorry! B-But, I was desperate to save you at that moment! I could only think that I had to do something…!”</p>
<p>Miroslav covered her face with both hands and began to cry. Seeing her like that, Lars immediately put his hand on Miroslav’s shoulder and spoke softly near her ear.</p>
<p>“I know. You’re not someone who hurts people. Besides, it was my incompetence that made you feel cornered. I take part of the responsibility. We’re in this together.”</p>
<p>“Ahh, Lars! I’m… sorry… sorry…!”</p>
<p>Miroslav hugged Lars as if surprised. And as I watched this melodrama with narrowed eyes, I said to myself, “What the hell is this?”</p>
<p>I mean, instead of apologizing to Lars, she should apologize to me. I don’t remember anyone apologizing to me after returning to Ishka.</p>
<p>Even Luna María, who seems to be the most sensible one.</p>
<p>Looking at that elf who has been silent for a while, she shrank into herself and turned pale. I don’t know if it’s my imagination, but she was trembling a little. It’s been like this since she found me again in the Tittis Forest.</p>
<p>I don’t think she feels guilty at this point. So what is she doing?</p>
<p>As I watched Iria in that state and Lars and Miroslav embracing, I wondered if I should leave or keep watching.</p>
<p>Do they all have flowers in their brains? It seems they really don’t understand what Miroslav did.</p>
<p>I let out a sigh. Then Lars spoke while embracing Miroslav.</p>
<p>“Sora, this is how it is. This is not only Miro’s responsibility, but mine as well.”</p>
<p>“So, you’re saying the great leader will also take responsibility?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>“How convenient. And how exactly will you take responsibility?”</p>
<p>“Of course, you’re free to do as you please. If you want me to bow my head, I will.”</p>
<p>“I see, you won’t bow your head unless told to, huh? You really don’t understand the situation, Lars.”</p>
<p>“What are you saying?”</p>
<p>“You told me I was free to do as I wanted, right? Then I’ll take you at your word. Move aside. I’m going to strangle that woman to death. That way we’ll be even.”</p>
<p>Saying that, I pointed at the red-haired mage with tears in her eyes.</p>
<p>“Don’t talk nonsense! There’s no way I’ll allow that!”</p>
<p>To kill Miroslav. The voice that Lars emitted upon hearing my request was so loud that it shook the wall.</p>
<p>He grabbed the right side of his waist where there was nothing. It’s a position where the hilt of his sword would be.</p>
<p>The anger of the sixth-class adventurer exploded. My former self would have trembled and cowered.</p>
<p>But for me at this moment, this man’s anger in front of me was like a gentle breeze.</p>
<p>“Why are you angry? You said it yourself, that you were free to do as you pleased, right?”</p>
<p>“There’s a limit! Why does Miro have to die!?”</p>
<p>“Why? Because that woman tried to kill me.”</p>
<p>“But you’re alive! You survived! So Miro doesn’t have to die!”</p>
<p>“Are you an idiot?”</p>
<p>“What did you say?”</p>
<p>“Since I survived, do you want me to let that ‘Murderer’ go? Yes, I survived, but it was due to my own strength and good luck. Neither the ‘Murderer,’ nor you, nor the others had anything to do with it. Where is the reason to diminish her sins?”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“Don’t call Miro an ‘Murderer’! I won’t repeat it! You’re alive! Miro didn’t kill anyone!”</p>



<p>Unexpectedly, a sigh escaped from me. And addressing Lars, I began to explain.</p>



<p>“Let me give you an example… Let’s see. One day, I stabbed you through the heart from behind.”</p>



<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>



<p>“Just listen. Naturally, you would die because of that. However, it turned out that there was a priest passing by who could use the miracle of ‘Resurrection’ and healed you. By surviving, you would obviously come to accuse me of my sin, wouldn’t you? You would accuse me of being a murderer. At that moment, I would respond like this: ‘But you didn’t die. So I didn’t kill anyone. Don’t call me a murderer.’ Well, what would you think upon hearing that? Would you accept it as if nothing happened?”</p>



<p>“Well…”</p>



<p>“Do you understand how irrational you are?”</p>



<p>As I told him that, Lars’s fists trembled, and he fell silent. And as if supporting Lars, Iria spoke up.</p>



<p>“That’s just an excuse. Lars, don’t let yourself be deceived. In the story, it wasn’t a heart stabbed from behind, but an arm wounded by Miro. Of course, it’s a sin, but it’s strange to compare a sin with a life.”</p>



<p>“It’s true! The magic that Miro cast hit you in the arm, you said it, Sora!”</p>



<p>Lars, who was fixated on this reasoning, regained his pale complexion with Iria’s help. Next to Lars, Iria stared at me intently.</p>



<p>“People who frequently mention stories often manipulate them to suit their convenience. Just like this man!”</p>



<p>Iria looked at me as if saying, “Let’s see you answer this if you can.”</p>



<p>Seeing that, I sighed, I don’t know how many times. There are two more idiots. No, wait, are they really not aware of it?</p>



<p>Luna María remained silent. Miroslav was hiding behind Lars, so I don’t know what she’s thinking… Well, it doesn’t matter.</p>



<p>Alright, I’m tired of this senseless conversation, so it’s time to end this.</p>



<p>“Miro didn’t stab your heart, she attacked your arm, right? Iria, do you know that’s much more brutal than killing? Despite being a C-ranked group, don’t you know what happens to the prey captured by the lord of the flies? By the way, I knew. I had Luna María read me a record before.”</p>



<p>Lars, who heard that, frowned in anger, and Iria fell silent immediately. Before my eyes, I saw Luna María’s shoulders trembling.</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“Do you really not know? As always, you’re bad at studying, Lars. Come on, Iria, tell him as you always do. Properly and in an easy-to-understand manner.”</p>



<p>“…Well”</p>



<p>“Um, Iria, what does it mean?”</p>



<p>“…The lord of the flies injects a paralyzing poison into its prey and takes them alive to its nest. To feed its larvae…”</p>



<p>“What? So, you’re saying that Sora…”</p>



<p>“You got it. I almost got devoured alive. Fortunately, I managed to come back alive, but the fear and desperation I felt at that moment… I wish I could share just a fraction of that with all of you!”</p>



<p>I started laughing deliberately and then turned to Iria.</p>



<p>“So, Iria, you said that attacking an arm is a sin, but it’s strange to compare it to a life, isn’t it? Come on, tell it to Lars again. If you’re captured by the lord of the flies, you’ll be eaten alive, but it’s still lighter than instantly killing, right?”</p>



<p>“…………..”</p>



<p>“Oh, wow, I’m disappointed by your silence. Are you exercising your right to remain silent as a priest of the temple? ‘Murderer’ and ‘Silent.’ HA, you really are good friends.”</p>



<p>“Sora! Enough! I won’t forgive you if you keep insulting my companions!”</p>



<p>I shrugged at Lars, who shouted without understanding his position.</p>



<p>“And here’s the ‘Angry Leader.’ Let me tell you this, Lars. When you were attacked by the lord of the flies, do you think it was a coincidence that the group fled towards where I was?”</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“Iria knew it. Of course, the mage Miroslav must have known about the lord of the flies’s habits too. An opponent they could never defeat. If they lost, someone would definitely be eaten by the monster. The one in the most danger was you, being unconscious. The three who love their dear leader started thinking. Is there any way to help the leader? Is there a way for them to survive… that’s surely what they thought. They encountered me before entering the forest. It wasn’t a coincidence. They intentionally fled towards where I was.”</p>



<p>Some of them trembled upon hearing that.</p>



<p>I continued explaining to Lars, who still stared at me intently.</p>



<p>“Why do you think Miroslav, who is skilled in fire magic, used wind magic at that moment? Because the power of fire magic is too great. Miroslav, who knew about the lord of the flies’s habits, knew that it was interested in capturing humans alive. It would be unfortunate if it killed its bait just by going a little too far. That’s why she used limited power wind magic. She only hurt me to a degree that wouldn’t kill me, to make me a living prey for the monster.”</p>



<p>“That’s nonsense!”</p>



<p>“Hmph. To you, I’m just a ‘Parasite’ from the past. Especially, Miroslav hated me more than the others. To the point of spreading bad rumors and driving me out of the city. Yet, I didn’t leave the city. I tried to stay even if the guild expelled me. It was at that moment that I was attacked by the lord of the flies…”</p>



<p>“Hey, Sora. Don’t tell me…”</p>







<p>“I thought it was a great opportunity. Lars, there’s a great cause to help you. Even if a crime is accused, it can be said to be an emergency evacuation. But it wasn’t like that. It was a planned murder using a monster.”</p>



<p>As I said all that, Lars stood up with a flushed face. If he had a sword at his waist, he would definitely have drawn it.</p>



<p>“Don’t spout nonsense! How dare you speak to your former companions like that?”</p>



<p>“My former companions? ‘Anyway, he has nothing to do with us anymore.’ That’s what you told me when we met in the forest, remember?”</p>



<p>“Guh…!”</p>



<p>Unable to refute, Lars gritted his teeth. Faced with Lars, I spoke in a lower tone than before.</p>



<p>“…Well, honestly, I don’t know if Iria and Luna María were thinking along those lines. But Miroslav was absolutely aware and decided to act that way. Most likely, she was leading when you were fleeing from the lord of the flies. So, what do you say, Iria, Luna María?”</p>



<p>Even when I asked, there was no response. There was no affirmation, but there wasn’t a denial either.</p>



<p>Iria can’t lie as a priest, and Luna María must be thinking that she shouldn’t lie. And Lars, who was unconscious, had no way to deny it.</p>



<p>When Lars looked at Miroslav with a frightened expression, the mage shook her head repeatedly, her red hair flowing.</p>



<p>“I-It’s a lie! It’s all a lie! Lars, please believe me. I… I certainly attacked that man. I did it to save us! But it was a quick decision! I had no malicious intentions like trying to kill him or anything like that!”</p>



<p>Miroslav clung to Lars. It was a repetition of before. I was just laughing.</p>



<p>“Well, that’s natural. There’s no woman who would say, ‘I tried to eliminate that nuisance with malicious intentions,’ in front of the man she loves.”</p>



<p>“Shut up, scum! I-I’m amazed that you can spout all that nonsense…! Do you think you can get away with insulting the daughter of the Sauzar Trading Company?”</p>



<p>Miroslav’s gaze was filled with a fire and a curse that could kill a person.</p>



<p>Some mages can use magic eyes and demon eyes, perhaps Miroslav can awaken that.</p>



<p>I raised both hands and looked at the receptionist who had remained silent throughout this spectacle.</p>



<p>“The daughter of the Sauzar Company said that. But I have no intention of withdrawing my accusation. So, I have a suggestion for the Adventurer’s Guild.”</p>



<p>“…A suggestion?”</p>



<p>“Yes, that’s right. Call a priest who can use ‘Lie Detection.’ So, if the words of that woman are evaluated, everything will become clear. If my suspicions are wrong, I will withdraw all my accusations. I will accept the punishment of the innocent called the ‘Murderer.’ I will also swear never to return to this city, let alone the guild. I don’t think the ‘Falcon’s Sword’ has any objections to this if they truly want to reveal the truth quickly… unless they’re lying, of course.”</p>



<p>I looked significantly at Miroslav. If my suspicions were truly mistaken, she should say something like, “So be it!” or something similar.</p>



<p>But I did see it, indeed. A flicker of doubt resided in the mage’s eyes. Probably, the receptionist saw it too. The next words I heard from her had a terrible mechanical sound.</p>



<p>“As you know, a certain amount of money is required to use miracles. When it comes to a high-class miracle like ‘Lie Detection,’ ten or twenty silver coins won’t be enough. Can you pay that amount, Sora-sama?”</p>



<p>Saying that, the receptionist stared at me intently. I’ll say it again, this receptionist is the one who informed me of my expulsion. She knows that I can’t even afford a silver coin for the promotion test.</p>



<p>With that clarified, the guild’s intention is more than obvious.</p>



<p>They’re trying to avoid any situation that could confirm any kind of guilt towards “Falcon’s Sword.” I narrowed my eyes and asked.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“Don’t guilds cover the expenses in these situations?”</p>
<p>“That applies if the guild deems it necessary. But, this proposal was made by Sora-sama. Therefore, Sora-sama is obligated to pay.”</p>
<p>“So, you’re saying the miracles aren’t needed despite hearing all of this?”</p>
<p>“I understand what truly happened. However, there are malicious intentions from Sora-sama, seemingly influenced by past events.”</p>
<p>“Are you saying I said all of this out of spite for being expelled from the group? If that’s the case, wouldn’t it be better to use ‘Lie Detection’ to clarify that? If I’m lying, it will be revealed immediately.”</p>
<p>“As I said, the necessary amount of money must be paid.”</p>
<p>“Tch!” After clicking my tongue, I spoke to the others.</p>
<p>“Hey, daughter of Sauzar Company. You could also be the leader of ‘Falcon’s Sword.’ It’s a good opportunity to prove your innocence. Won’t you pay?”</p>
<p>“It’s not necessary. I believe in Miro. I don’t need to rely on miracles.”</p>
<p>“For me, as long as Lars believes me, it’s enough! I don’t care what someone like you thinks!”</p>
<p>“Haa… I see, so it can’t be helped.”</p>
<p>“In that case, the proposal is shamele—”</p>
<p>“I’ll pay.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>I took out a gold coin from my pocket and placed it on the table. The receptionist’s mouth dropped open at the sight. It was the first time I saw her distorted face.</p>
<p>“You said ten or twenty silver coins wouldn’t be enough, so how much is actually needed? Isn’t a single gold coin sufficient?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“Do you need more? Then here you go. Still not enough? Here’s more. Look, here’s another one. I suppose this will be enough, right?”</p>
<p>As I hummed a tune, I accumulated several gold coins. Now, not only the receptionist, but Lars and the others also had their mouths wide open.</p>
<p>Surely, they didn’t think I could produce coins out of thin air just by collecting herbs.</p>
<p>…By the way, I found these coins in the nest of the lord of flies</p>
<p>They belonged to the adventurers who were taken to the nest and devoured by the larvae.</p>
<p>The dead don’t need money, so I took it as payment for defeating the larvae.</p>
<p>I urged the dazed receptionist.</p>
<p>“Hey, why are you daydreaming? I’ve already paid, so call the priest.”</p>
<p>“Yes… but, how did you get this much money?”</p>
<p>“Is it necessary to answer that question?”</p>
<p>“If you have this much money, we need to confirm the source.”</p>
<p>“Are you accusing me of a crime? Think very carefully before doing that!”</p>
<p>At the same time, I kicked the table in front of me. The gold coins on the table scattered from the impact. Witnessing that, the receptionist, with a trembling voice, shrunk back.</p>
<p>“You thought that a poor person like me, who was expelled from the guild, couldn’t pay, right? So you were trying to end this quickly. What a shame! Look, all this money is more than enough, so go call the priest already! I will also testify that this money is legitimate!”</p>
<p>The receptionist looked at me in terror and took on an aggressive posture.</p>
<p>Every day, she encounters rough adventurers, and many receptionists, aside from their beautiful appearance, possess a strong will. There are some talented adventurers among them. The receptionist in front of me is one of them.</p>
<p>If I were really speaking nonsense, there is no doubt she would refute it with a calm face. However, she surely knows that she made a mistake herself, which is why she can’t refute with such a strong will.</p>
<p>Humans can’t act as usual when they know they are wrong. If you’re a serious person, it’s even more pronounced. As an employee of the guild, the receptionist only acts according to the guild’s intentions.</p>
<p>I don’t commend myself for pressuring such a serious member of the staff, but I will suffer the disadvantages if I give in here. It’s too unreasonable. And then, I spoke up again.</p>
<p>“I would prefer it if you didn’t intimidate my personnel.”</p>
<p>With that voice, a man entered the room. He is around 40 years old.</p>
<p>He has striking eyebrows like a bird spreading its wings, and his eyes blink with a soft light that reveals great understanding and stable intelligence.</p>
<p>His appearance with silver hair combed back, and that emitting atmosphere gives him a subtle presence.</p>
<p>Level 35. The person in charge of Ishka and one of the top-class adventurers of whom there are only five in the entire Kingdom of Canaria, Elgart Quiss.</p>
<p>“Master! Have you returned already?”</p>
<p>“Yes, the meeting ended earlier than expected. I apologize for the inconvenience, Liddell-kun.”</p>
<p>“No, don’t worry… then… well…”</p>
<p>“Yes, Parfait-kun already told me in a way. Actually, I overheard a bit behind the door. I will take care of it from now on.”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes, please.”</p>
<p>Saying that, the receptionist named Liddell stood up. In exchange, Ishka’s guild master sat down.</p>
<p>The receptionist thought about whether she should leave the room, but she positioned herself behind Elgart like a secretary.</p>
<p>There was no longer a terrified color in her eyes; the serious light had returned. Apparently, Elgart’s appearance had the effect of awakening the receptionist’s eyes.</p>
<p>“Well, I suppose there’s no need for introductions. Let’s get to the point.”</p>
<p>Then Elgart looked at me and spoke with finality.</p>
<p>“The request for the use of ‘Lie Detection’ is denied. This is the guild master’s decision.”</p>
<p>“……….”</p>
<p>“Fufu, you have eyes that want to say something. Of course, that’s not all. I acknowledge the responsibility of ‘Falcon’s Sword’ in this case, so I will impose the respective penalty. Naturally, that includes compensation for the victim. By the way, it goes without saying that the compensation does not involve taking another person’s life. We cannot afford to lose a talented individual for the guild. On the other hand, I know there will be dissatisfaction, but I want it to be known now that I am here. What do you think, Lars?”</p>
<p>“I will follow the master’s decision. But if he makes an unreasonable request, it’s a different story. For example, if he says that instead of killing Miro, he will cut off her arm or crush her eyes. If it’s something like that, then I will fight without hesitation.”</p>
<p>“That’s natural.”</p>
<p>Elgart nodded and then turned his gaze towards me.</p>
<p>“Sora, I know it’s unforgivable that Miroslav attacked you with magic, but there’s a certain emotional aspect to being pursued by the lord of flies With the fact that ‘Falcon’s Sword’ will be punished, can you calm your anger?”</p>
<p>“….. What will be included in this ‘penalty’ specifically? At the very least, will it be announced that you attacked a civilian and used them as bait to escape?”</p>
<p>“No, that will be impossible. The bad reputation would not only affect ‘Falcon’s Sword’ but also all adventurers in general. Given the role of adventurers in the city of Ishka, we must avoid situations that create a rift between adventurers and residents.”</p>
<p>Saying that, Elgart crossed his arms and thought.</p>





<p>“As for the penalty, let’s see. It will be mandatory request assignments. The content will be the extermination of monsters in the Tittis Forest for a month. During this time, rewards such as materials and the commission for the request by ‘Falcon’s Sword’ will be given to you. Considering your abilities, it should be a considerable amount. And it also has the benefit of reducing the risk when gathering herbs in Tittis.”</p>
<p>“So, in other words, you’re just giving me a bone to end this quickly, right?”</p>
<p>“Haha, I see that you don’t hesitate to say that. Well, the guild will also give something for your reconciliation. This–“</p>
<p>Saying that, Elgart took out a silver guild identification card. A familiar name was engraved on it.</p>
<p>“This is…”</p>
<p>“That’s right, it’s your identification card. Sora, the Ishka Adventurer Guild welcomes you as a ninth-class adventurer. The monthly dues to the guild will also be waived for the next three years. What do you say, can you accept it?”</p>
<p>The guild master attempted to hand me the identification card with a kind smile.</p>
<p>Of course, that smile wasn’t just superficial. It had an intensity that said, “You must know what will happen if you reject this.”</p>
<p>The guild master nodded satisfactorily when I took the identification card.</p>
<p>“Very well. Now our Adventurer Guild is more united than ever–“</p>
<p>Regardless of what Elgart was talking about, I tossed the identification card I received.</p>
<p>With a sound, the discarded identification card fell into the wastebasket in a corner of the room.</p>
<p>Seeing that, Elgart narrowed his eyes.</p>
<p>“….. Is that your way of rejecting our proposal?”</p>
<p>I nodded with a bitter smile on my face. He is the guild master–but I dropped the honorifics I used to use.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“Did you think I would accept that piece of scrap at this point? You’ve been babbling on, but in the end, from my point of view, you rejected all my proposals and arranged things so that ‘Falcon’s Sword’ would be the ones benefiting. There’s no fairness here. If it’s different, then call a priest who can use ‘Lie Detection’.”</p>



<p>“I said that was rejected.”</p>



<p>“It’s the guild master’s decision, isn’t it? Then, by that decision, what binds me, who is not related to the guild? First of all, the staff there told me that I needed money for my request. I agreed to pay and I did. But as soon as the guild master appeared, they tell me they reject my request. I’m not convinced at all. Will you call the priest as requested, or will the guild master himself immediately admit the sin that woman committed by using a monster to kill me? It’s one or the other.”</p>



<p>“Sora, mind your words. There’s no adventurer in Ishka who behaves like that. Yours is just paranoia. I can’t sympathize with the misfortune you’ve fallen into, but if you keep spouting delusions, we’ll have to take appropriate measures.”</p>



<p>“Taking appropriate measures, huh? Ohh, I’m so scared. In that case, we’ll have to part ways to avoid those appropriate measures. It was really a waste of time coming to talk to the guild.”</p>



<p>As I stood up and said that, Elgart raised his hand.</p>



<p>“Wait, we’re not done yet.”</p>



<p>“You don’t want to listen to me, but I have to listen to you? That’s too selfish, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>I ignored his words and headed towards the door.</p>



<p>“The master said to wait. Please, come back.”</p>



<p>“Move. If you don’t, I’ll have to take appropriate measures.”</p>



<p>When I mimicked Elgart, the receptionist’s cheeks turned a bright red.</p>



<p>“….. Of all the things I’ve heard, there’s really a limit to how rude you can be. If you live in the city of Ishka, you should know everything the master has done for this city! Besides, you’ve been a guild member for five years!”</p>



<p>“Heh, he’s committed to the city, and I see he’s allowed murderers free. That guild master leaves much to be desired.”</p>



<p>“You!”</p>



<p>The receptionist, who was all red, took a step forward. It seems her patience in enduring my teasing of her beloved guild master has snapped.</p>



<p>At that moment, Elgart unexpectedly stood up, grabbed his subordinate’s shoulder, and restrained her.</p>



<p>“Liddell-kun, stop.”</p>



<p>“But, master!”</p>







<p>“There’s no need for you to raise your hand—Sora, if you don’t want to accept my proposal, then fine. However, there’s no need for the guild to move for those who don’t accept. Now, all the conditions I talked about will be discarded.”</p>



<p>“Do as you please. I don’t care about those conditions or whatever.”</p>



<p>“Also, consider this a warning. If you try to do anything that will harm the guild and its members–“</p>



<p>“Hahaha! ‘Take appropriate measures,’ you say? I already said it, do whatever you want. The guild has absolved their sins and granted favors to ‘Falcon’s Sword.’ A happy ending, I would say. I would celebrate if I could.”</p>



<p>Saying that, I pushed the receptionist in front of me and opened the door. I looked back over my shoulder and observed the people in the room.</p>



<p>Both ‘Falcon’s Sword,’ who tried to kill me, and the guild, who let them go scot-free. They have all become my enemies. I thought about telling them that, but there’s no need to warn them.</p>



<p>“Well then, goodbye—forever.”</p>



<p>Uttering a few small curse words, I left the room.</p>



<p>The discussion in the guild is over. It took about nine minutes, just as I expected. I’m not surprised they didn’t accept my claims. I knew they wouldn’t.</p>



<p>In fact, if they had admitted their sins, I would surely not have been able to hide my surprise.</p>



<p>—However, on the other hand, it’s true that I’m disappointed with this outcome. And like I said, it took about nine minutes, just as I expected. In other words, it’s like the other side of the coin, them accepting my case.</p>



<p>I am grateful to ‘Falcon’s Sword.’ I am truly grateful for being invited to the group five years ago. The farewell was bitter, but at first, it was a lot of fun.</p>



<p>Those days when we were all low-level, sometimes things went well, and sometimes they didn’t, but they were adventures filled with satisfaction that I had never experienced in Onigashima.</p>



<p>It was Lars and the others who gave me that. For that reason, if ‘Falcon’s Sword’ had admitted what they did, I would have let the matter go as a token of gratitude for those days.</p>



<p>However, the outcome is as I mentioned earlier.</p>



<p>I could confirm that Lars and the others I met five years ago are no longer the same. Likewise, the guild has also become my enemy.</p>



<p>Because they let Miroslav, who tried to kill me, go free as if nothing happened. And since there is the danger of those ‘appropriate measures’ in the future, all that’s left for me is to eliminate them. I thought about that and pursed my lips.</p>



<p>Now, the next problem is how to retaliate. It would be good to devour all those involved in this matter, but can I do that by attacking head-on?</p>



<p>I was able to obtain my soul equipment and raise my level, so I have certainly become stronger. But I am not the strongest in the world.</p>



<p>To put it simply, the problem is the guild master, Elgart Quiss. I can’t imagine defeating that first-class adventurer.</p>



<p>Not only Elgart, but Lars and the others also fall into the category of formidable enemies.</p>



<p>During the past years that I’ve been working on herb collection, ‘Falcon’s Sword’ has grown stronger by completing hundreds of missions.</p>



<p>I don’t know their exact levels—but Elgart’s level was publicly announced—Lars, being in the sixth class, would be impossible to be below ’10.’ It’s probably somewhere between ’15’ and ’20.’</p>



<p>The same would apply to Iria and Miroslav. In Luna Maria’s case, she might be slightly higher, but either way, I can’t do much now.</p>



<p>Even if they are rotten, they are a C-rank group, and by working together, they can surely display a power beyond their individual levels. Even if I defeated the lord of flies, I can’t underestimate them.</p>



<p>“In that case, it would be a good idea to divide them and hunt them down one by one,”</p>



<p>If possible, I would like to lure ‘Falcon’s Sword’ into the depths of Tittis Forest and annihilate them by exploiting a gap. By entering the depths, the guild’s surveillance won’t reach, and there will be no risk of involving unrelated individuals.</p>



<p>Above all, I have no intention of exposing my trump card, which is my soul equipment, to everyone. The problem is how to attract ‘Falcon’s Sword,’ but I have a plan for that. I will use the lord of flies’ nest where I was trapped. Specifically, I will capture Miroslav and throw her into the nest, then I will inform Lars and the others about that location.</p>



<p>That way, they will have to venture deeper to save Miroslav. That will be the moment to act.</p>



<p>It goes without saying why I chose Miroslav as my first target. No matter what happens or transpires with that ‘Murderer,’ it won’t affect me in the slightest.</p>



<p>Due to her temperament, she might misunderstand and think I want to violate her and choose to commit suicide, but if that happens, then so be it.</p>



<p>“With that decided, the next step is preparation. Food, water, clothing… Ah, will there be a fabric that can withstand the cold? Although it’s spring, the nights are still chilly.”</p>



<p>In some cases, I might have to live in the deep area of Tittis Forest for quite some time. The preparations must be well organized.</p>



<p>However, to turn that cave into a livable place, a considerable amount of materials will be required. And if I buy them in this city, the guild will know immediately.</p>



<p>I don’t think they can discover the plan, but there’s no need to give them any hints. I thought with my arms crossed.</p>



<p>After all, I have to leave this city and purchase supplies around the cities and towns near Tittis Forest. Then, there will be no suspicion. Besides, when I leave Ishka, ‘Falcon’s Sword’ and the guild won’t be as vigilant about me.</p>



<p>Well, they probably still think I’m at level ‘1.’ I don’t think they’ll be so careful with me, although that could also be a stumbling block for them.</p>



<p>Fortunately, I have enough funds, so it would be best to leave Ishka right away—thinking about that and returning my arms to their normal position, I realized something and let out a loud scream.</p>



<p>“Hmm… Ahhh!?”</p>



<p>Unintentionally, I wanted to hold my head. Damn it, I left all my gold coins at the guild! I could go back and retrieve them—no, that’s impossible.</p>



<p>After declaring everything so hostilely, how am I supposed to go back?</p>



<p>…Sigh. I could only sigh.</p>



<p>It can’t be helped. I think I still have silver coins, and there are still the adventurers’ equipment in the nest. I’m not proud of taking the gear from the dead, but I can’t turn back now. Thinking about that, I started walking through the streets of Ishka.</p>



<p>At that moment…</p>



<p>“…Sora…san.”</p>



<p>I heard a faint voice coming from behind. When I looked back, there was a blonde elf on the verge of collapse. It was Luna Maria.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>A little while ago.</p>



<p>“Then, goodbye—forever.”</p>



<p>Bang! As the room door slammed shut, Luna Maria held her own body with both arms as if hugging herself.</p>



<p>Her body was still trembling. A large amount of sweat from her forehead accumulated on her cheeks, dripping down and staining her clothes.</p>



<p>Iria noticed Luna Maria, as if she had been affected by a fever, and ran towards her, asking what was wrong in surprise, but her voice didn’t reach Luna Maria’s brain even though her eye bags trembled.</p>



<p>It’s possible that Luna Maria had lost her composure, so Iria tried to restore her energy using the miracle of “Vitality.” But Iria’s magic didn’t heal back Luna Maria.</p>



<p>Even if the person who used the miracle was the high priest of the temple, it would not have been possible to heal Luna Maria. The fear that struck her was too deep.</p>



<p>Luna Maria’s heart, raging like a storm, generated a question.</p>



<p>– Who is that young man who just left the room?</p>



<p>Of course, she knows his name is Sora.</p>



<p>They are now separated, but he was a companion she used to go on adventures with. She remembers what he liked to eat and what he didn’t. She knew that the name “ソラ (Sora)” was actually “空 (Sora)”<br />T/N: It’s the same, just written in katakana and kanji</p>



<p>In the Kingdom of Canaria, the language of the Adastela Empire, she wasn’t very familiar with Eastern writing, so his guild registration was set as “ソラ (Sora),” he told her with a small laugh before. Luna Maria had worked with Sora many times.</p>



<p>When circumstances forced them to split into two groups, the combination of Lars, Iria, and Miro was like an iron wall, so Luna Maria inevitably ended up being with Sora.</p>



<p>Furthermore, there were many occasions where the two of them would make preparations before the adventure and clean up afterwards. That’s why she knew Sora better than the other members.</p>



<p>But… but she didn’t know that appearance. She didn’t know that power.</p>



<p>What reflected in Luna Maria’s eyes, as a spiritual bearer, was not the form of a person. It was darkness, unpleasant, bottomless darkness.</p>



<p>An unusual shadow that spirits couldn’t approach. Something fierce, powerful, and despairing. Just looking at it made her tremble.</p>



<p>If Sora had wanted to, he could have killed everyone in this room without anyone being able to resist—it was an appearance that had enough “power” to convince her of that.</p>



<p>In Luna Maria’s knowledge, there is only one type of entity that corresponds to that giant shadow.</p>



<p>-… A dragon.</p>



<p>On that day, when they spoke in Tittis Forest, she couldn’t see that shadow. What happened to Sora in just a few days? No, was that really Sora in the first place?</p>



<p>Is it somehow possible that a chilling monster has entered the city using Sora’s appearance?</p>



<p>At that moment, Lars’ irritating voice entered Luna Maria’s ears.</p>



<p>“Master. He rejected your proposal. So, is this matter concluded?”</p>



<p>“That’s not possible, Lars. That and this are different things.”</p>



<p>“…..Huh?”</p>







<p>“I don’t want you to think what you did was okay. Originally, what you did is unforgivable. Using magic to attack another person and turning them into prey for a monster. It’s an action that doesn’t surprise me that you’re accused of murder.”</p>



<p>“B-But, Master, you said…”</p>



<p>“The reason I covered it up was because Sora’s actions were detrimental to the guild’s stability. It’s not that I accepted your reasons. Don’t get the wrong idea.”</p>



<p>The first-class adventurer, Elgart, stared deeply at Lars. As if being pushed by that force, Lars could only weakly nod. Seeing that, Elgart narrowed his eyes and continued speaking.</p>



<p>“Very well. Then, Liddell-kun.”</p>



<p>“Yes, Master.”</p>



<p>“Did Sora say anything about the lord of flies when he spoke to you? I read the report from Parfait-kun when I heard about the situation, but there were only three words, ‘I don’t know, I don’t understand, I don’t remember.'”</p>



<p>“From what I could hear in his conversation with Lars-san and the others, he was about to be eaten by the lord of flies’ larvae. And he also said, ‘The fear and desperation of that moment… I would like to share a hundredth of that with you.'”</p>



<p>“I see. That means he was certainly taken to the nest. I would like to find the location somehow… but given the time Sora had contact with the subjugation squad, there is a possibility that the nest is not deep but rather in a place near the outer periphery. If we don’t hurry, a large number of lord of flies could attack Ishka.”</p>



<p>Elgart pondered, furrowing his brows. Liddell, who saw that, opened his mouth with a sharp light in his eyes.</p>



<p>“Master, shouldn’t we talk to Sora-san to get more details?”</p>



<p>“That’s true. Besides the nest, I’m intrigued by how he, being level ‘1,’ could escape the paralyzing venom of the lord of flies while also avoiding the magical beasts of Tittis. I actually wanted to ask him about that… but, sigh, it was indeed too selfish not to listen to him and asked him about it.”</p>



<p>Elgart laughed a little bitterly as he recalled Sora’s words. It seems the guild master is not so angry with Sora. In any case, the answer to Elgart’s question was obvious to Luna Maria.</p>



<p>Even if they were magical beasts, no, precisely because they were magical beasts, there was no way to challenge the current Sora.</p>



<p>What effects could the paralyzing venom have on him?</p>



<p>The current Sora is a dragon. A mythical species.</p>



<p>… Luna Maria felt out of place with such thoughts.</p>



<p>Of course, she didn’t express her thoughts. It was all speculation on her part. The reason being that “Sora’s appearance resembled that of a dragon.”</p>



<p>She had never heard of the power of a mythical species residing in a person’s body at the Academy of Sages. It was not written in the countless books she had read until now.</p>



<p>Upon reflection, Luna Maria was the only one who was afraid of Sora. Lars and the others hadn’t realized it.</p>



<p>The same went for the guild master, the receptionist, the knights, and soldiers who participated in the lord of flies’ subjugation.</p>



<p>Even if Luna Maria were to say, “Sora is a dragon,” surely no one would listen to her. It was obvious for them to say that she was tired from all of this.</p>



<p>Thinking about that, Luna Maria noticed some dazzling gold coins on the floor…</p>



<p>“”…Sora-san.””</p>



<p>At this moment, Sora is in front of Luna Maria.</p>



<p>What did she want to do by pursuing Sora? What did she want to do by calling out to Sora?</p>



<p>Of course, she wanted to apologize. However, when she stood in front of Sora, her mouth didn’t move as if it was frozen. It was like a frog looking at a snake.</p>



<p>In this state, she could confirm it again. After encountering Sora in the Tittis Forest until now, she realized that what she saw was not an illusion or anything of the sort.</p>



<p>“”…Um, I want to return this to you.””</p>



<p>Somehow, a voice came out of Luna Maria’s mouth. Along with that voice, a small bag presented itself with a clear sound. Upon hearing that, Sora blinked several times as if surprised.</p>



<p>“Hm? Did you bother coming to return it to me?”</p>



<p>“Yes. And… I came to apologize for earlier.”</p>



<p>Saying that, Luna Maria deeply bowed.</p>



<p>With that movement, her blonde hair that resembled moonlight flowed down like a waterfall from her shoulders.</p>



<p>“I am truly sorry for hurting you… and abandoning you.”</p>



<p>The streets of Ishka were bustling as usual. In the midst of it, an elven beauty was deeply bowing. Obviously, she attracted the attention of those around her.</p>



<p>If it were the usual Luna Maria, she would have paid a little more attention to her surroundings and chosen a more appropriate place to apologize. But at this moment, she couldn’t afford to think about that.</p>



<p>She lowered her head as if in a hurry. If she didn’t do that, she wouldn’t make it in time—wouldn’t make it in time for what? She didn’t know that.</p>



<p>Then, Sora, who saw that Luna Maria, bitterly opened his mouth.</p>



<p>“I appreciate you returning the money. But your apologies are unnecessary. In fact, it’s uncomfortable.”</p>



<p>“Um…”</p>



<p>“I would like to say that if you wanted to apologize, you should have done so from the beginning. But well, I understand that you were confused being chased by a monster. I would have done something similar if I were in the same position. But why didn’t you lower your head in that room?”</p>



<p>“W-Well…”</p>



<p>She couldn’t say something like, “Because I was afraid of you.”</p>



<p>Sora pursed his lips as he looked at that Luna Maria.</p>



<p>“Ah, I understand that too. Because lowering your head at that moment would mean admitting the responsibility of ‘Falcon Sword.’ You wouldn’t have been able to lower your head alone and before Lars and the others, right? You don’t have to risk yourself for me and lose your relationship with your comrades. It’s fine. It’s natural. But then, why are you lowering your head here and now?”</p>



<p>“Well…”</p>



<p>“Hmph. Let’s suppose I accept the apologies, everyone’s happy. But even if I don’t accept, you’ll surely have the excuse of ‘At least I apologized.’ You wouldn’t lose your relationship with your comrades, and you would feel satisfied with your guilt-free conscience. But for me, it’s uncomfortable and unpleasant. You’re only apologizing for your own satisfaction. If you want to do that, then do it in front of a mirror, ‘Hypocrite.'”</p>



<p>“T-That’s not…”</p>



<p>Luna Maria tried to deny it, but at that moment, Sora quickly turned around and blended into the bustle.</p>



<p>Sora looked back at Luna Maria over his shoulder, observing her attempt to follow him.</p>



<p>“………….”</p>



<p>Faced with that cold gaze, her feet, which wanted to move forward, stopped. Sora, who saw that, left with a mocking expression.</p>



<p>The elven spirit bearer stood there, stunned, only able to gaze at his back.</p>
