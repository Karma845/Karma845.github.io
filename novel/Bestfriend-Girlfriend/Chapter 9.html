<h1>Chapter 9: Aramaki-san Is Cute and Macabre Mascot</h1>

<h3>Eve of the Death Game</span></h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Placing the headphones over my ears, I flicked the switch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amidst a crackling radio noise, a whisper-like voice reached my ears.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Onii-chan, today&#8230; I cooked hamburgers with Okaa-san. I learned how to make them properly and even dad said they were delicious&#8230; I want you to try them too.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sly devil&#8230;I wonder if she&#8217;s realised…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Murmuring softly, I sipped on my lukewarm coffee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It had been six days since I started monitoring Saori. So far, I hadn&#8217;t caught onto anything at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She behaves as an ordinary—no, one might even say, a well-behaved girl, to the point of being an exemplary student.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This voice I can hear through the listening device on the other side is part of her daily routine.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before she goes to bed, she reports daily events, probably to Fumio&#8217;s picture or something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After once intruding into her room forcefully, just after radio callisthenics, demanding, [Tell me about school!] and setting up the bug while she was preparing drinks, every night since then, I&#8217;ve found myself eavesdropping on these maiden-like reports.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Teruya-senpai scolded me and I cried] or [Sunflowers bloomed in the field along my way to school] or [I won a prize with an ice candy] None of them are devilish reports.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After getting into bed, Saori sleeps soundly without doing anything inappropriate and she falls asleep quite quickly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, she seems weak in the mornings and tends to whine quite a bit when her mother comes to wake her up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her mother, well aware of the situation, says things like, [You don&#8217;t want to show an untidy face to Fumio-kun, right? Wake up! You&#8217;ll run out of time to get ready] and drive her out of bed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I muttered with pursed lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“At this rate, there&#8217;s no way I&#8217;ll make any progress…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If there&#8217;s no progress after a while of monitoring, I&#8217;ll have no choice but to use a slightly forceful approach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even a demon would reveal their true nature when their life is in danger. However, revealing their true nature requires being prepared to engage with the demon in a serious manner.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Where&#8217;s Claudia?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked, Hikari pointed upwards with an [Nn]. She must be on the second floor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For a while now, that child has been continuously monitoring and eavesdropping on Saori Moribe.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Coach, what do you think about Moribe being a demon?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To be honest, I can&#8217;t believe it. That awkward girl being a demon&#8230; it&#8217;s hard to imagine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though Hikari tried to shorten the distance to make monitoring easier, she was unbelievably slow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her running figure was reminiscent of a countryside girl running through a flower field.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Due to her rather awkward gait and slow pace, we&#8217;re currently working on skeletal alignment through stretches with both Hikari and her partnering up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you know, if Claudia says so, then it must be true. There&#8217;s never been anything she&#8217;s been wrong about before.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hmm.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Teruya narrowed her eyes sceptically. Her face was covered with plasters and bandages.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lately, it seems she got a boyfriend but he&#8217;s apparently quite a violent guy. Her body is covered in bruises and marks and there&#8217;s hardly a day when her face isn&#8217;t under a bandage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Claudia and I tried to advise her to break up with such a violent man but she didn&#8217;t listen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“However, he&#8217;s kind to me sometimes…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a somewhat joyful expression, her mentality is something I can&#8217;t quite understand.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thought about these things, Hikari spoke up──.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, by the way, I got a message from my big sister.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──She said so.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, where do they put gasoline in trains?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Gasoline!? They don&#8217;t use gasoline! It&#8217;s not like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahaha, trains are amazing. They run without gasoline? Isn&#8217;t that dangerous?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha, Taka-chan, you always say funny things. Trains run on electricity because they&#8217;re trains.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, I see! Gen-san, you&#8217;re so knowledgeable!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While talking to the slightly chubby, glasses-wearing rail enthusiast, I chuckled inwardly.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Yes, this is how I&#8217;ll get another vote!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Playing dumb for a man with no significant traits. Lowering myself beneath the other person to stir up protective instincts, praising and flattering and finishing with a gaze of moist eyes and a slight upward glance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ll make him believe as if I’ve fallen for him, fostering that illusion.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By repeating such actions, on the fourth day of working, I finally secured the first place in the popularity poll.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Understanding the rules and putting in the effort accordingly will naturally lead to better results. This applies to both working at a girls&#8217; bar and studying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, the day I secured the first place, Rena-san wasn&#8217;t working.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And today, when Rena-san came to work, I easily slipped down to second place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t help but clench my teeth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Although it&#8217;s purely a calculated scenario, if more than seven days pass without me regaining the first place by the end of summer vacation, it&#8217;s game over. I won&#8217;t reach the earning goal of three million yen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this point, I&#8217;ve already wasted five days. There&#8217;s truly no more room for mistakes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Before my shift today, I was once again watching the DVD from start to finish, searching for any hints.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m confident in my gal language. My attitude and service are on point too. I might even be better than Mako-san by now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s the difference between Rena-san and me&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, if I do my makeup properly, I&#8217;m more beautiful than Rena-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But most customers who talk to both Rena-san and me tend to vote for Rena-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I watched the DVD like this, I even began to think that it would be easy if I could just use my body to make the customers go crazy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I had that thought, I felt like I understood what was missing in myself when I&#8217;m compared to Rena-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her guard is a bit loose. There&#8217;s a vague atmosphere that suggests if one pushes a bit,they might be able to get intimate.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, even when a drunken customer approached her, saying things like, [Hey, Rena-chan, let&#8217;s get married] she casually responded with a laugh, saying, [Haha, like seriously, getting married without even being pregnant is so not gonna happen].</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hold on a second!? Getting pregnant comes before marriage?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was shocked, but at that moment, the customer seemed embarrassed.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pregnancy = S*x. I think that&#8217;s the kind of association they had. So, what I need to work on is cultivating a sexy atmosphere.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gazed at the DVD cover and tried striking the same pose as the actress in front of the mirror.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I pulled aside my bikini bra to expose my chest and spread my legs wide. It felt embarrassing. Still, with an expression that seems like I&#8217;m feeling it, I stuck out my tongue and made a peace sign with both hands.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It looked silly. In my mind, I could see customers licking their lips and their lustful gazes focused on my cleavage. I imagined myself earning votes smoothly by catching those desire-filled looks from men.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If I can adopt this kind of atmosphere, I&#8217;ll definitely secure the first place tomorrow. That&#8217;s right! A bikini with even less fabric and a more seductive vibe would be better.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I felt reassured—this is what I thought.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Effort never betrays. That&#8217;s my motto, Takata Takaka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Perfect, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili nodded enthusiastically and smiled warmly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, the preparation for the Death Game was complete.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was a large room with about eighty tatami mats, all in white.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the centre, there was a white round table that could seat eleven people and on three of the walls were twelve doors. On the remaining wall, there was a large monitor that covered the entire surface.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only one door was painted red, and the names of the participants for this round were written on the other doors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230; it was quite a challenge.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The main difficulties this time were the installation of the large monitors, which couldn&#8217;t be provided through furniture, and the surveillance cameras for each room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili had arranged everything that didn&#8217;t require wiring, but still, the process of securing them was all manual work. With the help of the maid staff, we managed to get it done.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Tomorrow, when we talk about the contract at the office, it&#8217;s time for execution, Devi. Are you planning to take Oppai-chan and [</span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Nan de ya nen</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">] with you from the start, Devi?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Natsumi Shima]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I want to introduce them as new models I&#8217;d like to transfer together&#8230;I think that way, it&#8217;ll create a more involved feeling rather than them suddenly appearing.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think that&#8217;s a good idea, Devi. Also, let&#8217;s have Freesia and Torture kidnap the female and male model for the game, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded once and looked around the Death Game field again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san said that [Death Game is out of season] but at this point, I couldn&#8217;t contain my excitement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It felt like the day before a school festival, that kind of mood.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, I&#8217;ve never actually enjoyed a school festival in reality, not even once.</span></p>

<h3>The Twelfth Participant</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「Bufoooh!」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I stepped into the bedroom, Shima-san and Masaki-chan burst out simultaneously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A baggy navy suit and a wrinkled shirt. A needlessly vibrant red tie and round glasses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A posture even more stooped than usual.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">You know him as the Modero Project&#8217;s rookie manager, Fumijima Sajio style.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You don&#8217;t have to laugh that much…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, yeah, s-sorry. B-but, no, no good, can&#8217;t, hehe&#8230; buhuh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way, that&#8217;s, hahaha, no way&#8230; that&#8217;s cheating, seriously.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It took about five minutes for the two of them to calm down somehow.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During that time, they trembled and shivered while covering their mouths.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah&#8230; I thought I was going to die.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“My abs hurt, Fumio-kun.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While rubbing the corners of their eyes with their fingers, the two managed to regain their composure, tears still glistening.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;Is my outfit really that terrible?’</span></i></p>
<div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-18264740' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-18264740' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In contrast to me, who intentionally went for a geeky look, Shima-san and Masaki-chan were dressed stylishly in Kurosawa-san&#8217;s coordinated outfits.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think you two look&#8230; well, really good”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-san was wearing loose-fitting pants, a top with open shoulders, a style that&#8217;s popular this year. The colour coordination of mint green bottoms and a muted orange top felt skillfully done and made her look incredibly fashionable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, Masaki-chan had an attire that exuded the aura of a refined summer maiden. A light yellow floral dress on a white base, paired with sandals in the same pattern. The straw hat suited her really well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I feel kind of embarrassed. I don&#8217;t think I suit this kind of stylish advanced look”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s not true. Shima-chan, you&#8217;re tall, so these kinds of outfits suit you really well”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I-I wonder if that&#8217;s true”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-san blushed while scratching his head cutely.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then&#8230; shall we go?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sure.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Calling out to them, I activated the 『Revisit』  ability and connected the door to the back alley of the First Beauty Office&#8217;s self-owned building in Roppongi.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Finally, the day of the Death Game&#8217;s opening had arrived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Here&#8217;s the plan;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">First, the four of us – Kurosawa-san, Shima-san, Masaki-chan and I – will visit the First Beauty Office&#8217;s office. Probably, President Kurashima and Manager Yamauchi Kiyoka will come out on their end.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-san and Masaki-chan play the roles of models that I manage.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I want President Kurashima to allow these two to transfer along with MISUZU.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the stage where we&#8217;re about to sign the contract, suddenly everyone loses consciousness. Then, when we realise it, we&#8217;re sitting around a round table in the Death Game field.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The remaining two targets – Akira Mitsuki and Hikami Kirito – are to be abducted by Freesia-san and Torture, respectively.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And for each participant in the Death Game, there are individual rooms, with the names of the following eleven individuals written on their doors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumijima Sajio, MISUZU, NATSUMI, MASAKEY, Kurashima Itsuki, Yamauchi Kiyoka, Akira Mitsuki, Hikami Kirito, Ryoko Terashima, Kyoiko and Kanaya Chihiro.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The models of Modero Project, to which Kurosawa-san belongs, apparently have their stage names in alphabet characters according to the president&#8217;s preference. In a hurry, Shima-san and Masaki-chan also followed this pattern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And [Kyoiko] is actually Kyoko.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems to be the name she uses when performing on stage in a girl band but it&#8217;s incredibly uncool. Feels like something from the Showa era.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, this time, she&#8217;s not participating as the 『sweet lolita』 but in her original rocker style.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Initially, I had cast Shiratori-san as the 『survivor of mysterious Death Game from the previous round who kept making meaningful statements』 but unfortunately, she flat-out declined. I tried to persuade her but she was dead set on being busy. I couldn&#8217;t possibly persuade her and in the end, she managed to outmanoeuvre me to the point where I couldn&#8217;t even make a sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili mentioned that it would be a hassle to rewrite the scenario at this point and in my exasperation, I called Kyoko to my bed, asking, 『How about it?』 Kyoko responded with, 『I&#8217;m really into death games and stuff like that! I want to do it!』 She leaned in eagerly, so she was officially cast as Shiratori&#8217;s replacement.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s a certain unease considering Kyoko&#8217;s casual personality, but&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we stepped out of the door, Kurosawa-san was already waiting there.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a photoshoot in the morning, so she had come to Tokyo earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MISUZU-senpai, welcome back! I&#8217;m the rookie model NATSUMI!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I’m MASAKEY! Senpai!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W, wait! Cut it out! Seriously, you two!&#8221;</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san protested.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, even though Kurosawa-san tends to tease others, she&#8217;s really uncomfortable with being teased herself.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, Masaki-chan knows that and is doing it intentionally.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The four of us exchanged greetings and then headed towards the entrance and visited the First Beauty Office&#8217;s office.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we stepped into the entrance, it seemed like the information had been communicated ahead of time. Before we could even speak, the receptionist smiled and said, [Please take the elevator to the fourth floor].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And upon reaching the fourth floor, just like last time, Manager Yamauchi Kiyoka was waiting for us.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We were waiting for you.”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As she said that, she looked at Shima-san and Masaki-chan, narrowing her eyes in suspicion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumijima-san,who is this?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, well, um, these are the models I manage…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon hearing this, she gave a perplexed nod with an [I see] and led us to the reception room with the same quizzical expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once the sound of Yamauchi Kiyoka&#8217;s footsteps leaving the reception room faded, I hurriedly went out into the corridor and affixed the word 『Door』 above the reception room door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Behind that door, we had already set up a room identical to the reception room we had just entered. Inside this decoy reception room, we waited for the president&#8217;s visit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, with a brusque push, the door swung open, and President Kurashima and Yamauchi Kiyoka entered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As always, he looked like a forceful middle-aged man.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He glanced at Shima-san and Masaki-chan, then fixed a stern gaze on me.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;Does he have to give me that intimidating look every time, seriously’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who are these kids?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-well, regarding me and MISUZU-san&#8217;s transfer, I was thinking if I could bring along some promising models from those I manage…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, President Kurashima&#8217;s expression turned serious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;you, I might say that but there&#8217;s a certain code of conduct in the industry…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Laughable to bring up honour and duty at this point. With that thought in mind, I put on an ingratiating expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Please find a way around that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But you see&#8230;the smaller one there might have potential demand in the niche market&#8230; As for that one&#8230; I wonder.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Niche market…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan&#8217;s smile twitched and Shima-san let out an exaggerated exclamation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boss! Boss! Don&#8217;t you think we&#8217;d be good for variety shows? We&#8217;ll do our best, so please consider it somehow!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Boss…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seeing President Kurashima&#8217;s face distorted with displeasure, Kurosawa-san interjected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“President, please, I&#8217;m begging you. These two are precious juniors to me as well. As part of my contract terms, please include a contract with them too.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon hearing that, President Kurashima exchanged glances with Yamauchi-san and let out a deep sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If MISUZU-san&#8230;says that, I guess I don&#8217;t have much choice.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Thank you!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, Yamauchi-san, bring the contract.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As President Kurashima spoke, Yamauchi-san handed a saddle-stitched contract to Kurosawa-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is the contract document. One copy is for our company and the other is for you to keep, so please sign and stamp both, and don&#8217;t forget the seal as well.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Very well, MISUZU-san. Please sign and stamp.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh&#8230; You mean, right here, right now?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, exactly. This isn&#8217;t a draft, it&#8217;s a formal document. We&#8217;re not offering more favourable terms than this. We want to finalise and sign the contract here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seems like they have no intention of consulting others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave a small nod to Kurosawa-san as she looked at me for confirmation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And just as she was about to pick up the contract──…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“MISUZU-chan! No! Don&#8217;t sign it!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The door swung open forcefully and a woman burst into the room, yelling as she entered.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">All eyes turned toward her at once.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With medium-short hair that framed her face, freckles on her nose and an orange girly dress, the woman was Sameta Yasuko, an editor at Morita Publishing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was Pompoko-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She had a desperate expression that didn&#8217;t seem fitting for her gentle round face. She snatched the contract from Kurosawa-san&#8217;s hand and as if seeking revenge against a personal foe, she crumpled it up vigorously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pompoko! You, what&#8217;s the meaning of this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the president yelled and glared at her, she looked momentarily taken aback.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But in the next instant, she opened her eyes wide and shouted desperately.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When I heard that you were signing a contract with MISUZU-chan today, I couldn&#8217;t just stand by anymore! I know, you see! The president has been signing contracts with and suppressing annoying models one after another!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">President Kurashima gritted his back teeth and turned to Yamauchi-san, shouting.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What were the security guards doing! Oi! Yamauchi-san, call the police! Get this idiot out of here now!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fine, go ahead and call the police or whatever! I&#8217;ll spill everything I&#8217;ve heard from the models! I&#8217;ll reveal it all!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As President Kurashima and Pompoko-san glared at each other, Yamauchi-san repeatedly tapped on her smartphone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The call wouldn&#8217;t connect. There was no way it could connect. Not within this 『room』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I quietly whispered to Kurosawa-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you talk?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m sorry&#8230; She asked me to go out for lunch together and I declined&#8230; I never thought things would turn out like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As we exchanged hushed whispers, I heard Lili&#8217;s voice in my ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If anyone else comes, it&#8217;ll be troublesome,Devi. Time to start it, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I nodded subtly and activated 『Sleepwalking』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, a purplish smoke-like substance covered everyone&#8217;s faces except for me. Kurosawa-san, Shima-san, Masaki-chan,those seated slouched over, those standing like Yamauchi-san and President Kurashima and even Pompoko-san, who had been standing, all collapsed to the ground simultaneously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this point, I was the only one still awake in this place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230; hey, Lili. What should we do? Pompoko-san…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I asked, Lili manifested in the air.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pompoko, that raccoon-faced, right,Devi? Well, can&#8217;t be helped, Devi. Let her join as an impromptu participant. Fortunately, there&#8217;s an extra room from Ryoko. We have enough rooms.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;It might be better than sending her back and letting her cause a scene. But Pompoko-san seems like a kind person, so I hope she doesn&#8217;t get into too much trouble…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll handle it properly. Alright, give the command to move everyone to the Death Game, Devi.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I summoned the door connecting to the Death Game and instructed everyone who was asleep to move through it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, they began to walk slowly, as if they were sleepwalkers.</span></p>

<h3>Introducing The Mascot</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone, are you ready, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah&#8230; I think so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to Lili&#8217;s question, I nodded slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A pure white, spacious room. A large monitor was installed on the front wall and on the other three walls, rows of doors were lined up. Twelve doors in total. Just one of the doors behind me was red and it stood out incredibly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Once again, I looked around at the people sitting around the round table.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Clockwise from me, Kurosawa-san, Akira Mitsuki, President Kurashima, Yamauchi Kiyoka, Hikami Kirito, Ryoko, Ponpoko-san, Shima-san, Kyoko, Kanaya-san, Masaki-chan.</span></p>

<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Akira Mitsuki, President Kurashima, Yamauchi Kiyoka, Hikami Kirit, and Pompoko-san were still asleep. Their souls were pinned by Lili.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Wallets, smartphones, wristwatches. Everything they were wearing has already been confiscated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This is to manipulate the time perception. Even though it&#8217;s currently nine o&#8217;clock at night, they&#8217;ve been told it&#8217;s nine o&#8217;clock in the morning to confuse their sense of time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at the others, Kurosawa-san had her hand on her chest, taking deep breaths repeatedly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan seemed somewhat excited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-san was constantly writing characters in her palm and swallowing them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kyoko had her legs thrown over the edge of the round table, hands clasped behind her head and she was creaking the chair while tapping her feet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lastly, Kanaya-san was staring intently at Hikami Kirito.</span></p>
<div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-42766326' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-42766326' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, what about Pompoko-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked that, Lili casually responded.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now, don&#8217;t worry about it,Devi. As long as there are many people, even if a </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">tanuki</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400"> moves in any way, it won&#8217;t affect anything. If the numbers decrease, we&#8217;ll adjust accordingly each time,Devi”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, she raised her voice towards everyone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“When you pull the pin, it starts, Devi. After that, the mascot character will lead the way and if any irregular events occur, I want you to immerse yourself in the assigned character and strive for appropriate actions and reactions, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un, I&#8217;ll do my best.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seyana.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:Okay, but in kansai dialect]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan and Shima-san nodded to each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Leave it to me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Kyoko said this and gave a thumbs up, Lili fixed a sharp gaze on her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re the one who&#8217;s most anxious,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll be fine. Sheesh, you really don&#8217;t trust me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, hey. By the way, what kind of mascot are we talking about? I think something cute would be nice. Like a cat or a rabbit.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kurosawa-san leaned forward and said that, Lili grinned.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve prepared an incredibly cute mascot character, Devi. Adorably cute and a bit macabre too.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I can&#8217;t help but feel uneasy. Lili&#8217;s sense of style is just too unique.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, it might be devilishly cute in its own way, I suppose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, let&#8217;s begin, Devi. For now, everyone should pretend to be asleep, Devi. We&#8217;ll start from the moment you wake up, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230; mmm…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had a dream about a whale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A majestic sight of rapidly ascending from the depths of the water to the surface. Following it, I &#8211; Sameta Yasuko &#8211; ascended to the water&#8217;s surface. Gradually, my consciousness was awakening.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Morning&#8230; I don&#8217;t want to go to work…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While thinking something like that at the back of my mind, I rubbed my eyelids.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, as I slowly opened my heavy eyelids, I found myself in an unfamiliar place.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘A,aree? Where am I? Where is this&#8230;? When did I fall asleep?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a fuzzy mind, I tried to recall what had happened before falling asleep but like a small boat adrift in the ocean, my thoughts couldn&#8217;t seem to reach any shore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Pompoko-san! Pompoko-san! Are you okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I was called, I raised my head and saw MISUZU-chan looking at me from the other side of the wide table with a worried expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I absentmindedly looked left and right.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Several faces surrounded the round table, some familiar and some unfamiliar.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Around the same time I woke up, it seemed like everyone else had woken up too and they all had dazed expressions.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">To my right, a woman with distinctive short hair and dressed in a black suit was sitting. I didn&#8217;t recognize her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, to my left was a girl with short hair, wearing a somewhat familiar muted orange top.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Where have I seen this girl before?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I thought that, a flashback of the scene where I was glaring at President Kurashima in the reception room of First Beauty Office rushed back.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘That&#8217;s the girl who was in the reception room!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite trying to remember, my memory was interrupted after that reception room incident.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking around at the people sitting at the table again, it became clear that all the individuals present were the same ones who had been in the reception room at that time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">President Kurashima, Manager Yamauchi, MISUZU-chan, Fumijima-san, and two other girls who seemed to be new models.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Other familiar faces were Akira Mitsuki-chan and Hikami Kirito-kun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And&#8230; Kanaya Chihiro.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I don&#8217;t have direct acquaintance with her but I have offered to photograph her several times before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back then, she was a model highly recommended by our editor-in-chief and was supposed to be part of First Beauty Office. However, my offers were continually declined and before I knew it, I stopped seeing her in the media.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems I&#8217;m not the only one who doesn&#8217;t understand what&#8217;s happening. Everyone has a perplexed expression and is looking around.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Only one person, a woman with bright red hair and a short leather jacket, resembling an outdated hard rocker, had a smirk on her face, her lips slightly parted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What the hell is this! Whose prank is this!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, President Kurashima slammed his fist on the table and shouted loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why is Kanaya here! What the hell are you scheming!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">His cheeks twitched as he pointed his finger at Kanaya, who stared back at the president with a steady gaze, remaining silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up, old man. Don&#8217;t be such a scaredy-cat.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The red-haired hard rocker spoke in an annoyed tone, propped her legs onto the table and began to rock the chair back and forth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Who the hell are you! What&#8217;s with that attitude!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A–, shut up, shut up. Sit quietly, if you don&#8217;t want to die either?”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘You don&#8217;t want to die…’</span></i></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With her unsettling words, everyone exchanged anxious glances.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as the president was about to raise his voice even more, a crackling noise suddenly filled the air, and the large monitor mounted on the wall displayed an image in an instant.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A black circle in the centre. Surrounded by white.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As everyone held their breath wondering what the pattern could be, the camera began to slowly zoom out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gradually, it became clear that it was an eye, a perfectly round eye. And as the entire body of the eye&#8217;s owner came into view, someone muttered in disbelief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;A salmon?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Indeed, it was a salmon. A full-fledged salmon.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not some cartoonish character. It was a genuine salmon.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Good morning, Jake. This is Aramaki-san, the salmon here to inform you that it&#8217;s nine in the morning!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Accompanied by the voice of a childish girl, the salmon&#8217;s mouth moved with a flapping motion.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instantly, question marks appeared over everyone&#8217;s heads.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a single phrase, it could be summed up as 『What is this?』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Aramaki-san is the mascot who will oversee the progress of this game! Counting on you, Jake!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone had an expression that suggested they didn&#8217;t know what to do, staring at the monitor in bewilderment.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Among them, Fumijima-san had a face that seemed to be holding back a headache, clutching his head for some reason.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A mascot&#8230;Seriously, that&#8217;s such an underwhelming visual.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The person with short hair to my left commented with a hint of exasperation.</span></p>
<p><img decoding="async" class="alignnone size-large wp-image-103167 lazy" loading="lazy" src="https://travistranslations.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/p261-698x1024.jpg" alt="" width="698" height="1024" srcset="/app/uploads/2023/09/p261-698x1024.jpg 698w, /app/uploads/2023/09/p261-204x300.jpg 204w, /app/uploads/2023/09/p261-102x150.jpg 102w, /app/uploads/2023/09/p261-768x1127.jpg 768w, /app/uploads/2023/09/p261-1046x1536.jpg 1046w, /app/uploads/2023/09/p261.jpg 1308w" sizes="(max-width: 698px) 100vw, 698px" /></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Speaking in Kansai dialect, she probably couldn&#8217;t help but react.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">People from the Kansai region tend to think that responding when someone makes a humorous comment is a form of politeness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『You rude little girl, Jake. Aramaki-san is a cute and macabre mascot, Jake!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the screen, Aramaki-san&#8217;s eyes zoomed in.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do they keep zooming in so much! Well, I mean, calling it macabre, yeah, it&#8217;s kinda macabre, but still!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rather macabre&#8230;Fish eyes are unsettling because you can&#8217;t really tell what they&#8217;re thinking.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Hmph, we&#8217;ve gotten off track because of your rudeness, Jake. Let&#8217;s get back to the main point, Jake!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, the camera zoomed out again, revealing the supposed Aramaki-san&#8217;s entire body.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then she (or it) said this again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『You all are going to kill each other, Jake.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that instant, it felt like the temperature in the room dropped.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While I think it&#8217;s unlikely, I&#8217;ve seen this kind of development in manga or novels before.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A&#8230; A death game?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As MISUZU-chan&#8217;s voice trembled, Aramaki-san on the screen nodded skillfully.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『That&#8217;s right, Jake&#8230; but it&#8217;s not like directly killing each other, Jake. You&#8217;ll decide together who to kill, Jake. We&#8217;ll handle the actual killing, Jake.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“D-Decide? What do you mean&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">This time, a girl with a disproportionately large chest despite her youthful appearance asked the question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The other girl who was in the reception room at that time.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『It&#8217;s now past nine in the morning, Jake. You all have until nine in the evening to decide who to kill and vote, Jake. When it&#8217;s nine in the evening, we&#8217;ll count the votes. The person with the most votes will be taken care of here, Jake.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“S-So, s-so, you mean someone among us will die?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumijima-san, with a terrified expression, spoke with a trembling voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Not exactly, Jake.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon Aramaki-san&#8217;s response, Fumijima-san let out a sigh of relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But──&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Except for the last two remaining, everyone else will die, Jake.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「Hiiiiii!?」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aramaki-san zoomed in again, causing both MISUZU-chan and the girl with the youthful face and large breasts from earlier to grimace in fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nevertheless, the close-up of the salmon was incredibly intense.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Voting happens every day. It continues until there are only two people left, Jake! The last two people are safe. As a souvenir, Aramaki-san&#8217;s homemade </span><i><span style="font-weight: 400">ikura </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">will be given, Jake.』”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Red caviar]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is ridiculous! What are you planning, money? Revenge?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Cut it out! I can&#8217;t take this anymore!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As President Kurashima raised his voice and Akira-chan let out a hysterical scream, the woman in the suit who had been sitting next to me stood up, kicked her chair, and spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is a trivial farce. I don&#8217;t know what your intentions are, but surrender now! If you do, your crimes won&#8217;t be that severe.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Hooou? Detective Terashima, you won&#8217;t join the game, Jake?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Zooming out again, Aramaki-san&#8217;s full body was displayed on the monitor.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Apparently, this woman was a detective. Honestly, I felt relieved. It was like I had found a saviour, or at least that&#8217;s how it felt.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no way that&#8217;s happening. This sushi nonsense! The exit is probably that red door, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Saying that, she started walking toward the red door with determined steps and on the screen, Aramaki-san let out a sigh. Well, at least it looked that way.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that moment──&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, the image of the female detective disappeared.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No, to my eyes, it seemed as if her figure had been abruptly erased.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Panicking, I looked over and where she had been standing, the floor was wide open.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘She fell!?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost simultaneously realising this, a [Gyaaaaaaaah!] echoed from within the hole, a scream that made me want to cover my ears, coming from the female detective who had fallen into the hole.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「Hiii!?」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“「「Wha!?」」”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone hurriedly rushed to the edge of the hole, peering down, their voices choking in their throats.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Inside the hole, there was a thick iron stake, about ten centimetres in diameter, jutting out from the bottom. The female detective was impaled on it, much like a kingfisher impaled its prey, trembling involuntarily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uaaaah!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiiii!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Everyone recoiled in horror at the spectacle, something one might have only seen in fiction and stumbled back as if their legs had given way, landing on their rear ends.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, the floorboard closed and a heavy silence descended.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Foolish, Jake&#8230; There are always these types, Jake. Misunderstanding women like her. It&#8217;s regrettable that the number of participants is decreasing, but there&#8217;s no helping it, Jake.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aramaki-san sighed with a mixture of exasperation, and Kirito-kun muttered in disbelief,[Seriously…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking at everyone, it was clear that everyone had faces filled with fear. Most likely, I was no exception.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Especially President Kurashima, Akira-chan and Kirito-kun had turned pale.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But amidst the heavy atmosphere, someone let out a chuckle, saying, [Haha…]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning toward the source of the laughter, I saw the rocker in the leather jacket, who had her  legs thrown over the table, sitting with a wry smile as she rattled her chair.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t be so scared. After all, you&#8217;ll be seeing people die almost every day from now on.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yo-you&#8217;re part of this scheme too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the president raised his voice, she grimaced in displeasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give me a break, old man. I&#8217;m just a survivor, a veteran of this. The previous winner of this death game. I never thought I&#8217;d get dragged into this mess again. I have no luck&#8230; just my damn luck to be in this situation again.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the president continued to raise his voice, Aramaki-san interjected.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Uh, hello? Can I continue with the explanation? If you don&#8217;t listen carefully, you might die without even knowing it, you know?』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Being told that, the president had no choice but to quiet down. Everyone exchanged uncertain glances and settled back into their chairs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I did too. I had no strength left to resist anymore.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There was no longer any doubt that this was a real, serious death game.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Aramaki-san cleared her throat and resumed the explanation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Ahem, well&#8230; I did say that eliminating the person with the most votes was a possibility, but it&#8217;s not a dead end. If you complete the missions we assign, the voting results can be nullified.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Missions?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『The details of the mission are announced at the time of vote counting each time. If you complete it, you can avoid death on the spot.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;But in the end, only two people will survive, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When Kanaya-san asked, Aramaki-san nodded, 『That&#8217;s right,Jake.』</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Alright! Until night at nine o&#8217;clock, please relax and think about who to vote for. The doors around here are everyone&#8217;s individual rooms. The doors have names written on them. You&#8217;re free to use those rooms.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And just as the screen was about to go dark for a moment, Aramaki-san seemed to remember something and zoomed in again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Oh, right, I almost forgot. For more detailed rules, refer to the 『Death Game Manual』 prepared in each room. It&#8217;s a good idea to read it thoroughly. If you&#8217;re careless and get yourself killed, it won&#8217;t be fun for us either.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this, President Kurashima let out a groaning sound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8230; playing around like this, just who the hell are you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Fufufu, Aramaki-san is just a part-time worker. Hourly wage is 870 yen. The wage goes up by 10 yen for each person who dies. So, I hope everyone dies enthusiastically.』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Money!? If it&#8217;s money, I&#8217;ll give it to you! Just tell me how much you want!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“『Nnn&#8230;that&#8217;s impossible. If you get off here, Aramaki-san herself will be killed. After all, among these eleven people, Aramaki-san&#8217;s employer is also mixed in!』”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After saying that, Aramaki-san disappeared along with elaborate effects.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A heavy atmosphere hung in the air, making it difficult to breathe.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after Aramaki-san&#8217;s image disappeared from the monitor, no one dared to speak for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aramaki-san&#8217;s employer, in other words, the mastermind behind this Death Game, is among these eleven people. There&#8217;s no way to stay calm knowing that.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Not knowing what to do, I observed my surroundings with a somewhat anxious gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you suspect one person, you suspect everyone. In this inexplicably tense atmosphere, the first to move was Hikami-kun. He got up from his seat and walked towards the president.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Following suit, Akira-chan and Yamauchi-san also stood up and the four of them began whispering quietly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Meanwhile, near MISUZU-chan, two people who seemed to be new models and Fumijima-san also started gathering.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">President&#8217;s group and MISUZU-chan&#8217;s group&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If this Death Game is based on a majority vote, then the choices of these two groups will undoubtedly shape the course of the game.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But in the end, only two can survive…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if these four work together to eliminate others, there will come a point where they must part ways.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For instance, if the president survives, who would be the other survivor?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s clear that the president has a strong affection for Akira-chan but it&#8217;s also well-known that Yamauchi-san is the president&#8217;s mistress. If a choice had to be made, who would he ultimately choose?</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, it&#8217;s hard to believe that Hikami Kirito would simply accept being cast aside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If the president&#8217;s group and MISUZU-chan&#8217;s group clash, the key to victory or defeat would lie with the remaining individuals.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Myself, Kanaya-san and the hard rocker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning my gaze toward the hard rocker and Kanaya-san, the two of them have hardly moved since earlier.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The hard rocker is leaning back with her feet up on the table, gazing up at the ceiling, while Kanaya-san is looking towards Hikami Kirito with a detached expression.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;ve had my fair share of exposure to movies, manga, and novels centred around death games, so I&#8217;m not exactly devoid of background knowledge. I really want to navigate this situation successfully and make it out alive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I were to choose a partner to team up with and survive among this group, it would undoubtedly be MISUZU-chan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After all, I barged into the First Beauty Office to protect MISUZU-chan and ended up getting dragged into this death game in the first place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I think it&#8217;s risky to join MISUZU-chan&#8217;s group so early on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s a possibility of becoming a target for the President&#8217;s group&#8230;</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘First, I should talk to the hard rocker&#8230; she&#8217;s an experienced participant. But she seems intimidating&#8230;&#8230; but….Un’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as I mustered the courage to stand up and approach the hard rocker to talk, almost simultaneously, I heard MISUZU-chan&#8217;s voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumijima, for now, how about you die?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-That&#8217;s&#8230; MISUZU-san, th-that&#8217;s just a joke, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kicking at the feet of the approaching Fumijima-san, MISUZU-chan coldly retorts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t come closer. You&#8217;re creepy. You think you can be useful to me? I&#8217;d be happy if you just died. Are you stupid?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she turns to the two seemingly new models and speaks in a commanding tone.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Both of you, for now, put your votes on Fumijima, got it!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230; MISUZU-neesan…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? NATSUMI, since when did you get the privilege to voice your opinions to me?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Under MISUZU-chan&#8217;s intimidating glare, the girl with the short haircut falls silent.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understand? I am the most valuable one among us. I&#8217;m going to ride the stardom and become a big success. If I die here, it&#8217;s a huge loss for the world, you know? If you listen properly, one of you can survive, so it&#8217;s fine!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Honestly, I was taken aback. I never thought MISUZU-chan would be such a foolish person.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If anything, I thought she was a polite and well-behaved girl.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The way she earns everyone&#8217;s resentment with such a domineering attitude and even discards her own group&#8217;s votes, it can only be described as the epitome of foolishness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“P-Please spare me, MISUZU-san&#8230; I-I don&#8217;t want to die either…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fumijima-san pleads, prostrating himself right there without any hesitation. MISUZU-chan laughs loudly and proceeds to trample on his head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahahaha! Shut up, ugly. Be happy that you can die for me.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I stare in astonishment at the scene, I hear a murmured voice from Hard Rocker.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;The first one&#8217;s decided.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Seems like it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kanaya-san agrees.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Looking over at the president and the others, even they all furrow their brows in unison.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s certain that votes will accumulate for MISUZU-chan. That&#8217;s the only conclusion I can draw.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But MISUZU-chan, seemingly oblivious to the tension in the air, wears a broad smile and raises her voice.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone! For now, let&#8217;s all vote this Fumijima. That way, we can survive the first day.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“P-Please forgive me&#8230; P-Please…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Fumijima-san pleads desperately while being kicked, his pitiful state is embarrassing but even more glaring is MISUZU-chan&#8217;s high-handedness.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If MISUZU-chan continues like this, the president&#8217;s group will undoubtedly have a huge advantage. But if the president survives, my chances of staying alive disappear, don&#8217;t they?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if the president manages to secure four votes, getting close to MISUZU-chan is not a good idea. She&#8217;s like a sinking ship.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘For a while, it seems better to stay quiet and not team up with anyone…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In this kind of voting system, not standing out is crucial.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, breakfast should be arriving in our rooms around now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I solidify my immediate strategy, Hard Rocker springs up from her chair and walks toward one of the doors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, this one, this one.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Pointing at one of the doors, she enters it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next, Kanaya-san also stands up and enters one of the doors.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Since I&#8217;ve decided to not stand out, it&#8217;s not wise to stay in this place.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I also look for my name and go around checking the names written on the doors one by one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then&#8230; I found it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ryoko Terashima or Sameta Yasuko”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Written on the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shudder. Most likely, from the beginning, it was decided that someone would die as a warning.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That one person was either me or that detective.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Instinctively, I imagine myself being impaled by that thick stake in my stomach. With trembling hands, I turn the knob and step into the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other side of the door is a simple room about six tatami mats in size.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The walls are still all white with no windows and there&#8217;s a basic bed and desk. It looks like a cheap business hotel room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m relieved that I can lock the door from the inside.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next, I peek under the bed but there&#8217;s nothing suspicious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I let out a relieved breath and looked around. On the desk, there&#8217;s a hot sandwich, a salad with boiled eggs, a pot of coffee and a tea cup.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hard Rocker said, 『It&#8217;s about time for breakfast to arrive』 and I guess this must be it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I wondered if it&#8217;s safe to eat&#8230; but I&#8217;m hungry. There&#8217;s no benefit to poisoning the food here, so it should be fine. Reassuring myself, I reach for the hot sandwich.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I take a bite, the hot sandwich is still warm and quite delicious. It tastes fancy, like the breakfast in a high-end hotel.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With the hot sandwich in one hand, I glance around the top of the desk and notice a few items of interest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There&#8217;s a black box with a slot like a piggy bank, labelled 『voting box』. Next to it, there&#8217;s a stack of papers and a ballpoint pen.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Presumably, I need to write a name and put it in here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Vote counting is at 9 PM in the evening. Since I don&#8217;t know the exact time, it might be a good idea to vote early.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And beside that, there&#8217;s a stapled booklet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Nowadays, mimeographed on traditional Japanese paper. On the cover, it says 『Rules of the Death Game』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cover art is a deformed depiction of a boy and a girl smiling happily. However, there&#8217;s a noose around the boy&#8217;s neck.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘It&#8217;s pretty bad taste…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I furrow my brows involuntarily and open the first page. It reads, 『The Death Game lasts until you enter the grave. Let&#8217;s follow the rules and enjoy killing each other together』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The following pages list what seem to be detailed rules. I can&#8217;t remember them all but I should at least grasp the ones that might come into play.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The main points are as follows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──────────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">1.Please make sure to vote. Invalid or multiple votes will result in immediate death as a penalty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">2.Meals will be provided three times a day on the desks in your rooms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">3.Apart from the time of vote counting, you are free to stay in your own rooms.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">4.There are no assigned seats at the round table. Feel free to sit wherever you like.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">5.If you wish to enter someone else&#8217;s room, you must have the resident&#8217;s permission. Unauthorised entry will result in immediate death as a penalty.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">6.The name used for voting will be counted as a valid vote as long as the person can be clearly identified, even if there are spelling differences or nicknames.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">7.If necessary, killing each other is also permissible.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">8.Bananas are not included in snacks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">──────────</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Particularly, we must be cautious about Rule Five.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seems likely that someone might try to use this as a trap. Pretending it&#8217;s their own room to lure others into a different room&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And Rule Seven is just too unsettling.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As for Rule Eight, it&#8217;s like stating the obvious. Bananas are definitely not considered snacks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Perhaps it&#8217;s best to avoid contact with anyone as much as possible. At this point, there&#8217;s only one person among us that I truly think wouldn&#8217;t matter if they died.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I picked up the pen, wrote 『President Kurashima』 and dropped the paper into the ballot box.</span></p>

<h3>Behind the Scenes of the Death Game (Day 1)</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We were gathered around the sofa set in the 『Confinement King&#8217;s Bedroom』.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Starting from me, going clockwise, there&#8217;s Kurosawa-san, Shima-san, Ryoko, Kyoko, Kanaya-san, and Masaki-chan.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As you&#8217;re aware, all of us are participants in the Death Game.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In reality, in each of our private rooms within the Death Game, there&#8217;s a door that leads to this 『Confinement King&#8217;s Bedroom』.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The reason we pretend to switch night and morning with President Kurashima and Pompoko-san and the reason we prohibit entry into other rooms without permission, is so that we can maintain our daily lives without interruption.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While pretending to be holed up in our rooms, Shima-san continues to attend club activities and I participate in radio callisthenics. Of course, Kurosawa-san and Masaki-chan are also living their lives as usual.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s currently past ten o&#8217;clock at night.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Aside from Kurosawa-san, who is supposed to be staying in Tokyo. Masaki-chan and Shima-san were scheduled to return home after this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Currently, there’s a monitor temporarily set up in this room, the situation in each room is being displayed.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At the round table in the Death Game, only Hikami Kirito and Yamauchi Kiyoka remained. Hikami was holding Yamauchi&#8217;s hand, appearing to be persuading something earnestly.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">On the other hand, in the President&#8217;s room, there was Akira Mitsuki.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The two of them sat down on the bed and a chair respectively, engaging in a serious conversation with grave expressions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, Pompoko-san was sprawled out sleeping. Surprisingly resilient.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now, thank you for your hard work.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-64918586' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-64918586' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I spoke, each of them responded with a [thanks for your hard work].</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We&#8217;ve just started, but is there anything concerning or any problems? Are you guys okay?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For the time being, we&#8217;re fine. It&#8217;s just started after all.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan said with a wry smile and Kurosawa-san slumped down with a sigh.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It was tough for me&#8230; having to do something so mean to Fumi-kun.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? Weren&#8217;t you quite enthusiastic? It&#8217;s been a while since I&#8217;ve had my head stepped on and it reminded me of a few things&#8230;Maybe you still dislike me or something…”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-No! Th-That&#8217;s not it! I-I don&#8217;t feel that way at all! S-Sorry! A–nn…Mouu, Fumi-kun, you&#8217;re so mean!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As Kurosawa-san clung onto me while puffing up her cheeks, I chuckled and said [Ahaha].</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_3/article_incontent_3 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She then looked up at me with a sidelong glance.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If Fumi-kun wants to get back at me, you can do that right now&#8230; You see, there&#8217;s a bed right there…”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misuzu-chan, no sneaky moves! It&#8217;s not allowed!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan, clinging from the other side as if threatening, made Kurosawa-san puff up her cheeks again.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, now, you two. Kurosawa-san has to give her best tomorrow. And besides, I need to console Ryoko today&#8230; Ryoko, are you feeling okay?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes. Your kind words are much appreciated.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In reality, Ryoko seemed as usual from what I could see. She had changed into new clothes as well.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It must have hurt, right? I&#8217;m sorry.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No need to worry. I&#8217;m used to being penetrated by Master&#8217;s object..”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though I was trying to console her, I received a crude and explicit response. And that too, with a straight face.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the midst of the indescribable atmosphere, Kyoko&#8217;s expression of astonishment made her glance at Ryoko twice.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, the real Ryoko doesn&#8217;t seem like the type to make such explicit comments.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By the way&#8230; what&#8217;s up with that? Aramaki-san.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Can you not ask me about it?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In response to Shima-san&#8217;s question, everyone simultaneously made subtle expressions.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even I can&#8217;t comprehend that sense of humour. It&#8217;s just too mysterious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From a devilish perspective, is that thing cute? In a way, it was certainly macabre.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_4/article_incontent_5 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, anyway, aside from Aramaki-san&#8217;s matter, is there anything else that caught your attention?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I changed the topic, Kanaya-san pushed her hair behind her ear and spoke up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;m bothered by how Yamauchi Kiyoka was unusually quiet&#8230; She&#8217;s a cunning woman, that one.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe she&#8217;s just assessing the situation? If we&#8217;re calling her cunning, that makes even more sense.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I think so. She&#8217;s probably strategizing. At the moment, she&#8217;s definitely in a group that can secure four votes&#8230;but it&#8217;s about when she&#8217;ll betray. Probably around that point.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then I looked around at everyone again and spoke up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For now, in the first vote, let&#8217;s put all our votes for Kurosawa-san. Even if Kurosawa-san votes for Akira Mizuki herself, she&#8217;ll have at least five votes cast for her. Even if President Kurashima&#8217;s group and Pompoko-san gather votes for different people, it&#8217;ll be a tie at five votes each. The possibility of Pompoko-san and the president teaming up is quite low.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that&#8217;s true.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_6 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Shima-san shrugged.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kurosawa-san has to do her best since the goal is to show her taking on a mission and avoiding instant death&#8230; We need her to give it her all.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I turned my gaze towards Kurosawa-san, she nodded vigorously.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un&#8230;I&#8217;m still aspiring to be an actress after all.So, I&#8217;ll make sure to convincingly show that facing death is better than the alternative. ”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I stroked her head, Kurosawa-san narrowed her eyes like a cat basking in the sun.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, let&#8217;s call it a wrap for now&#8230;But before we disband, Kanaya-san, how are you feeling right now?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly directed at, Kanaya-san displayed a slightly troubled smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_5/article_incontent_7 -->
<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230;I feel unsettled, thinking that revenge has finally begun. As promised, once everything is over, I&#8217;ll be yours. You can do whatever you want with me, cook me or burn me.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon which, Kurosawa-san made a somewhat incredulous expression and spoke up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Somehow, that sounds more like an exchange condition&#8230; Like becoming Fumi-kun&#8217;s possession is a reward or something”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan and Ryoko nodded in agreement, Shima-san gave a wry smile and Kyoko seemed to express a look of disbelief, as if saying, [Is that even possible?].</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Sorry&#8230;but I still don&#8217;t really understand what&#8217;s so great about him. At least for now, I&#8217;m just using him.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Kanaya-san smiled somewhat sorrowfully.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yesterday, finally, I managed to win by just one vote against Rena-san and secured first place.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I think what made the difference was that I managed to steal some votes from Rena-san&#8217;s regulars by giving them a peek at my nipple.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even if I drop from the first place, I have a two-day margin. But today, I&#8217;m in a pretty tough situation. Judging by the current situation, I&#8217;m probably in third place. The current first place is not Rena-san&#8230; it&#8217;s Mako-san.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mako-chi, you&#8217;re seriously amazing today. What&#8217;s up?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Un, Taka-chi is giving it her all, so I thought I should do my best too.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“He, Heeee…”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Just you wait, I won&#8217;t let you interfere! Don&#8217;t get in my way!’</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While stomping my feet internally, I forcibly put on a smile.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I could tell my cheeks were twitching. To be honest, I&#8217;m feeling quite anxious.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">For now, Mako alone has gathered votes equivalent to Rena-san&#8217;s and my votes combined.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She&#8217;s really on a roll or, should I say, super enthusiastic…</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s up? Taka-chi, you&#8217;ve got a troubled expression.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In front of me, one of Rena-san&#8217;s former regulars, whom I had just taken votes from yesterday, was still lingering around.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Do they plan to stay until they get to see my nipple?</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I gave the slightly cloudy-faced customer my most charming smile.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Internally, I was stamping my feet, thinking, [Hurry up and put your votes in and leave. Don&#8217;t you realise the turnover rate is slowing down?!]</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the closing procedures were done and everyone had left, in the locker room.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A dimly lit room with only a faint morning sunlight coming through a small window.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There, I tightly bit down on my lips.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the end, in today&#8217;s popularity vote, I dropped down to fourth place.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The first place is taken by that damn clueless idiot Mako. Seriously&#8230; she&#8217;s just making things worse with her extra enthusiasm.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I banged my palm on the long table in frustration.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I had been cornered. Despite the summer vacation still being quite long, there was only one more day of margin left. From here on out, I had to keep the first place──or everything would be over.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If my relationship with Sensei became clear, the dream of a happy family that could have been achieved after graduation would vanish like a bubble.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Sensei would be fired. I would be expelled. Falling from being a diligent disciplinary committee member, we would be forcibly separated by society&#8217;s scornful gaze.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8230; should I do?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I was at a dead end. The sense of suffocation was overwhelming. It felt like even when reaching out, I couldn&#8217;t grasp anything, and my chest tightened with frustration. At this point, I just wanted to throw everything away and run away from here.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my current state, I even considered if I could survive by working in a place like a girls&#8217; bar somewhere where nobody knew me, and lived like this.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you think you’re taking you time to return….what&#8217;s got you seriously down?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Hearing that voice from behind, I turned around to see the cockroach maid standing there.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Shut up.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are you giving up already?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Because, there&#8217;s just no way anymore! There&#8217;s still thirty days left of summer vacation! There&#8217;s no way this is possible, no matter how you look at it!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaa…”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The cockroach maid nodded with a look that seemed like she had given up.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There&#8217;s no help for it, then. I shall offer you one solution, as an empty promise from me, Takata-sama.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Solution?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Yes, currently, I&#8217;ve been instructed by the Head Maid-sama to hire a promiscuous woman to take care of master&#8217;s sexual needs.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haa?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Didn&#8217;t you hear me? A promiscuous woman to take care of his sexual needs. The reward is ten thousand yen per ejaculation. Since Master has inexhaustible stamina, earning a hundred thousand yen in a night is a feasible matter.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wait a minute! Hold on a second!? You mean&#8230; your master&#8230; K-Kijima Fumio, right? You mean I have to&#8230; to, to, have s*x with him?”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way! Absolutely not!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is that so? In that case, let&#8217;s pretend this conversation never happened&#8230; If it gets out that the promiscuous woman I&#8217;ve arranged is you, Takata-sama, I would receive severe punishment from the Head Maid-sama, so it would be better if you declined.&#8221;</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If it gets out&#8230; I mean, even he can tell how I look!”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, do you not recall that when you last spoke with Master, the room was pitch dark? Master is not aware of your current appearance. As long as you play the role of a vulgar promiscuous woman, it&#8217;s unlikely he&#8217;ll recognize you.”</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Even me&#8230; he wouldn&#8217;t recognize me?’</span></i></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The moment I had that thought, I felt my heart tremble intensely.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">《To be continued.》</span></p>
