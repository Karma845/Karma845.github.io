<h2>Chapter 9: The Course of the Waves</h2>



<p>When I visited Kanzaki-sensei, she suggested, “Let’s change the location,” so we moved to the tea ceremony clubroom.</p>



<p>Instead of the usual <em>matcha</em>, she began preparing <em>sencha</em><sup data-fn="b7bd30be-cc53-4135-be20-f0d1712f1575" class="fn"><a href="#b7bd30be-cc53-4135-be20-f0d1712f1575" id="b7bd30be-cc53-4135-be20-f0d1712f1575-link">1</a></sup>. She meticulously arranged a teapot, tea caddy, and two teacups. Despite being a simple gesture, her graceful posture and elegant movements never failed to amaze me. I sat in seiza and waited for the water to boil.</p>



<p>“Do we even have time to drink tea?”</p>



<p>“I’ll finish by the fifth period. At worst, since the next class is 2-A, I can be a little late…”</p>



<p>“You can be pretty flexible for your own class.”</p>



<p>“Enough with the nonsense. If you have something to discuss, spill it all.” Even while urging me, her expression remained unchanged, and there was no hesitation in her elegant movements.</p>



<p>“…A kouhai confessed her feelings and I turned her down.”</p>



<p>As she was about to put tea leaves into the teapot, her hand came to a sudden halt. “What did you say?”</p>



<p>I disclosed the entire sequence of events between me and Sayu. While brewing sencha, Kanzaki-sensei listened silently. Finally, she spoke;</p>



<p>“It seems Sena-san is in the midst of an unprecedented popularity surge.” Kanzaki-sensei was clearly taken aback.</p>



<p>“No, the consultation isn’t about me; it’s about that junior girl.”</p>



<p>In response to my earnest attitude, Kanzaki-sensei quickly regained her dignified expression.</p>



<p>“Tell me.” Saying so, she offered me a cup.</p>



<p>“She’s Yukinami Sayu, a first-year. Do you know her, Sensei?”</p>



<p>“Come to think of it, there was a girl with that name who came for a trial at the tea ceremony club.”</p>



<p>“Do you also know that she spread the rumor about Yorka’s morning return?”</p>



<p>“Did Yukinami-san say that herself?”</p>



<p>“Yes, she told me this morning.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei sighed. “This is not for Sena-san or Arisaka-san. Let me clarify that before we proceed.”</p>



<p>With that, she began her explanation.</p>



<p>“I personally investigated the source of the rumor. I just finished questioning every member of the tea ceremony club,” Kanzaki-sensei stated.</p>



<p>“All of them? That must have been quite a task.”</p>



<p>I was astonished by her seemingly effortless demeanor. The tea ceremony club at Eisei High was notably large, surpassing most cultural clubs. I heard that each grade had more than ten members. Interviewing everyone in just two weeks was an incredible undertaking, especially for a busy teacher. Not only did she have the responsibilities of a club advisor, but she also dedicated time to such matters.</p>



<p>I deeply respected Kanzaki-sensei for her unwavering dedication.</p>



<p>“Having the source of the rumor linked to the tea ceremony club reflects poorly on the club’s dignity. As the advisor, I cannot condone such behavior.”</p>



<p>“So, have you identified the person who started the rumor?”</p>



<p>“I confirmed with each club member who they heard the rumor from. Following that chain of communication, it led to a first-year student who had come for a trial at the tea ceremony club. That student turned out to be Yukinami Sayu.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei’s investigation and Sayu’s confession aligned, leaving me speechless. My escapism-driven wish had been shattered completely by the teacher’s thorough investigation.</p>



<p>“Do you find it shocking?” Kanzaki-sensei asked as I fell into silence.</p>



<p>“What are you going to do?”</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“I mean, regarding Yukinami Sayu, what will happen to her?”</p>



<p>“I won’t do anything,” Kanzaki-sensei stated firmly.</p>



<p>I lifted my face, which had been lowered down without realizing it.</p>



<p>“Listen, Sena-san. To begin with, Arisaka-san never stayed out until morning—this truth was created by none other than you and me. Or, do you want to take revenge on the person responsible?”</p>



<p>“No, I don’t. I don’t want anything like that!” I exclaimed, leaning forward to convey my sincerity.</p>



<p>“Now that it’s settled as baseless, I have no intention of stirring up trouble. Especially after a certain someone publicly announced their relationship. I’ve already dealt with enough commotion.” Kanzaki-sensei was still clearly upset about the recent incident.</p>



<p>“I’m sorry.” I could only bow my head in apology.</p>



<p>“Even if she’s a close junior, you truly are a compassionate person to shield the culprit,” Kanzaki-sensei remarked.</p>



<p>“In the end, the fault lies with me.”</p>



<p>“According to what I heard, Yukinami-san didn’t intentionally spread the rumor. It seems it slipped out, and the others found it amusing, spreading it as a result. The diffusion of the rumor wasn’t necessarily Yukinami-san’s intention. At least, that’s how I perceived it.” Her words helped me understand the unexpected revelation Sayu made on the rooftop.</p>



<p>“So that’s why she acted out of character.”</p>



<p>Sayu was a good girl. Pretending to be bad didn’t suit her. She was the type who would regret hurting someone, even in the heat of the moment. Was it impulsive, or did she want to punish herself by doing so?</p>



<p>At least, I couldn’t fathom that being what Yukinami Sayu’s wanted.</p>



<p>“Did that give you any hints?”</p>



<p>“Do I look that obvious?” I instinctively touched my own cheek.</p>



<p>“Noticing changes in students is a teacher’s job.”</p>



<p>Well, it seemed I couldn’t keep secrets from my homeroom teacher.</p>



<p>“Sensei, is it possible to rebuild a relationship that’s been broken once?”</p>



<p>“It’s quite difficult unless the other party desires it.” Her advice remained objective, which I appreciated at this moment.</p>



<p>“I understand that trying to reconcile with someone who doesn’t want to is a tough proposition. But…”</p>



<p>“Repairing a relationship that’s been tainted even once is no easy feat. Especially when it involves matters of love.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, you’re right…”</p>



<p>My relationship with Sayu was over this morning. There was no denying that.</p>



<p>“Cutting ties is also a mature and respectable decision to accept reality. Unfortunately, life is too short to invest time and emotions in something with no prospects.”</p>



<p>It was akin to holding onto unrequited love, chasing an unattainable dream, and blindly trusting in unreturned affection.</p>



<p>──Humans were creatures inclined to believe in things that might not exist. Despite that, Kanzaki-sensei posed this question;</p>



<p>“However, just as Yukinami-san knows a lot about you, you should also know her quite well. What is the real her? What does she truly desire deep down?”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>“Time can’t be reversed, but emotions are not irreversible. Friendship can turn into love and then return to friendship; that’s entirely possible.”</p>



<p>“That sounds too convenient.”</p>



<p>“Then why don’t you give up, Sena-san?” She digged into the unspoken reasons behind my insistence on Yukinami Sayu.</p>



<p>“Because I’m a stubborn idiot who can’t let go.”</p>



<p>“Don’t be sulking. You’re more mature than you think. You can properly move on when things are beyond your control. Holding on is not just about guilt; it’s also because you still see the potential to mend the relationship. That, I believe, is the same old you, who never gives up on anything.”</p>



<p>Nonetheless, in the end, the teacher gave me that final push.</p>



<p>It was easy to cut ties and return to being strangers. To pretend not to notice each other in the hallways or refrain from starting a conversation when passing by. But I hated such a formal and distant behavior.</p>



<p>If Sayu regretted spreading the rumor, I still had words worth saying.</p>



<p>“I thought you might stop me.”</p>



<p>“If you were a student who obediently followed what I say, it would have been much easier.”</p>



<p>“So, is it a mistake to appoint me as a class rep?”</p>



<p>“Absolutely not. I chose you myself. You’ve been contributing enough to make it worthwhile. Keep it up.”</p>



<p>“Are you still going to boss me around?”</p>



<p>“On the contrary, the real challenges start now. Please handle the autumn sports festival and cultural festival smoothly.”</p>



<p>“I don’t intend to create more trouble.”</p>



<p>“Who’s saying that?”  Kanzaki-san rested her hand on her cheek, seeming concerned about what lay ahead.</p>



<p>“Am I being trusted, or are you worried?”</p>



<p>“Both, Sena-san.”</p>



<p>Finally, I took a sip of the sencha she had brewed for me. “Oh. It’s delicious.”</p>



<p>“Because I used good tea leaves.”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry to bother you.”</p>



<p>“When you come to the staff room with such a serious expression, it’s only natural to suggest a change of location just to be cautious.”</p>



<p>“I’m glad I could get advice from a popular teacher.” Talking to Kanzaki-sensei lifted a weight off my chest. I finally felt like I could return to my usual self.</p>



<p>“…Why do you assume I’m popular?”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that the case?”</p>



<p>“I wouldn’t know; I’ve never been in such a situation.”</p>



<p>“Eh, I’m sure you’re constantly getting approached, right?”</p>



<p>I was convinced Kanzaki-sensei was deliberately playing dumb. A woman with such remarkable beauty as hers undoubtedly had one or two romantic episodes.</p>



<p>“What about your college days? Weren’t you often invited to mixers or asked out by guys?”</p>



<p>It was impossible to ignore a woman like Kanzaki Shizuru.</p>



<p>“If you mean when I first entered college, my classmates often approached me, but eventually, they stopped inviting me. They’d say, ‘<em>When Shizuru is there, the group date turns into a girls’ night out,’</em> with tearful expressions… I felt somehow apologetic.”</p>



<p>Ah, she was avoided because having her around meant no guys left for the rest.</p>



<p>“And what kind of witty responses did you use to captivate the men’s hearts?”</p>



<p>“I didn’t captivate anyone. I just answered when asked.” Kanzaki-sensei rested her chin on her hand, unable to comprehend.</p>



<p>“What about part-time jobs or clubs?”</p>



<p>“I wasn’t allowed to have part-time jobs by my parents. I was part of the traditional dance club, but I was always surrounded by female friends and being constantly warned, ‘<em>Don’t be fooled by strange guys.’</em>“</p>



<p>“You’re being treated like a national treasure and were protected. I can somewhat understand your friends’ feelings.” I strongly empathized with her circle of friends.</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>“They were worried about their dear friend being deceived by a bad guy.”</p>



<p>Her lack of worldliness could be seen as endearing. But that didn’t guarantee there wouldn’t be opportunistic guys taking advantage of her.</p>



<p>“My friends are all overly protective.”</p>



<p>“What about after graduating from college?”</p>



<p>“I took a teaching position at Eisei right after graduating, so I’ve been busy every day.”</p>



<p>“Huh? So, no new encounters as a working adult?”</p>



<p>“No, and what’s the matter with that?”</p>



<p><em>Hmm? That’s odd</em>. There was something about this which bothered me. Although this beautiful teacher had been approached by many people, there hadn’t been any mention of her being in a relationship.</p>



<p>“Do you have a boyfriend, sensei?”</p>



<p>“No, I don’t.”</p>



<p>“Have you had one before?”</p>



<p>“…Not particularly.” Kanzaki-sensei turned away, almost as if avoiding the question.</p>



<p>“Sensei.”</p>



<p>“What is it?”</p>



<p>“You’re surprisingly open when asked.”</p>



<p>“──Sena-san!?” I unintentionally discovered my homeroom teacher’s lack of romance experience. This fact strangely made my heart race.</p>



<p>It was no wonder her friends guarded her. She seemed composed, but she was surprisingly vulnerable. If such an exceptional woman answered questions so openly, men would likely misunderstand and think they had a chance.</p>



<p>I had caught a glimpse of Kanzaki-sensei’s naive, unguarded side, which was hard to imagine from her stern image as a teacher. As always, it didn’t show on her face, but I could sense that she was feeling embarrassed.</p>



<p>“Your dedication to your work is admirable, Sensei.” I offered a follow-up before I accidentally provoke her. Normally, she’d immediately retort with a cold tone, but for some reason, she fell silent.</p>



<p>A silence enveloped the tea room.</p>



<p><em>Wait, what’s this feeling? …Why do I feel embarrassed too?</em> I couldn’t even come up with a single joke since I was surprised by the unexpected gap. The atmosphere became awkward, and the fact that we were alone in the tea room, which I hadn’t paid much attention to until now, amplified the tension.</p>



<p><em>Why am I so flustered?</em></p>



<p>“Don’t tease a teacher like that. Is that how you charmed Arisaka-san?” Kanzaki-sensei spoke first.</p>



<p>“No, not at all! I just expressed my admiration as a student.”</p>



<p>“I find it troubling how loose-lipped I become when talking to you, Sena-san.” with her usual demeanor, she continued the conversation.</p>



<p>“Isn’t that just because you’re an easy target, Sensei?”</p>



<p>“Sena-san.” My light-hearted remark was met with an exasperated look.</p>



<p>“But, sensei, it’s quite a predicament dealing with students. You should be careful around bad guys.”</p>



<p>“Sigh. I must be pathetic if a student is concerned about me.”</p>



<p>“I’m being serious. If you ever feel down, it makes me sad too.”</p>



<p>It was precisely because I trusted Kanzaki-sensei that I found myself concerned. I wanted my caring homeroom teacher to be happy too.</p>



<p>“…That’s how it is.”</p>



<p>“We’ve both laid bare our situations here. Let’s call it even.”</p>



<p>“What do you mean by ‘even’ between a student and a teacher?”</p>



<p>She casually brushed it off.</p>



<p>“Anyway, I’ve got the gist of the situation. Just steer clear of secret rendezvous with girls in the future. I won’t be able to handle another round of trouble.”</p>



<p>“Does this meeting with you count?”</p>



<p>“Don’t drag me into your harem!”</p>



<p>“My apologies!”</p>



<p>Under Kanzaki-sensei’s intense gaze, I gulped down the tea in one go and hastily exited the tea room.</p>



<p>The clock showed exactly five minutes before the start of the fifth period. The consultation ended just in time for me to make it to class.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>Today’s classes ended after the fifth period for first-years. Yukinami Sayu’s somber mood persisted, and before she realized it, it was time to head home.</p>



<p>Various emotions such as sadness, anger, and regret swirled intensely within her. Her heart was like a kite with a broken string, floating aimlessly in the air, unsure of how or where to land.</p>



<p>No, what awaited her wasn’t a landing but a fall. Once she fell, she’d shatter into pieces, never to return to her former self.</p>



<p><em>──I severed the connection myself.</em></p>



<p>Sena Kisumi’s face looked incredibly pained when he turned down her feelings. And when she admitted to spreading the rumor, he seemed deeply hurt. It’d better to thoroughly break and shatter than to drag out an unrequited love in misery. That was the plan.</p>



<p>Yet, even with her determination, that kind senior insisted it was a lie and refused to believe otherwise. She betrayed the one who tried to believe in her.</p>



<p>If she hadn’t witnessed them walking hand in hand that Saturday morning, she might have been able to honestly move on from the heartbreak. Living so close turned out to be a disadvantage she never expected.</p>



<p>However, she couldn’t erase the sight burned into her eyes. Unable to accept that reality, the words spilled out before she knew it. When she snapped back to reality, it was already too late.</p>



<p>The expressions around her at the moment they heard the revelation were unforgettable. The innocent curiosity and vulgar interest sparkled on everyone’s faces. In the blink of an eye, the rumor had spread.</p>



<p>She got scared as her careless remark had become the talk of the school by Monday. She feared his disdain. She gave up on joining the tea ceremony club even though she was curious about it.</p>



<p>As she grappled with guilt, there was a part of her that wished they would just break up. She harbored that hope. But ultimately, the relationship became public knowledge.</p>



<p>Sayu realized she couldn’t win anymore.</p>



<p>Maybe that’s what they called a destined love. Overcoming any obstacle, strengthening their bond with each challenge.</p>



<p>Her love was the opposite.</p>



<p>Yukinami Sayu lacked the courage and missed the opportunity again and again, but she still couldn’t give up completely. And in the end, she failed to catch up.</p>



<p>She blamed the other party for not confessing first, adhering to the notion that girls must patiently wait, but… <em>who even decided that? </em>She despised her past self for not being able to do such a simple thing as expressing her feelings. She regretted her lack of action that came too late.</p>



<p>At the end of it all, she harbored resentment and caused the person she liked to be hurt, and now she was lost. She fled the classroom as if running away, eager to leave the school as quickly as possible.</p>



<p>She descended the stairs, changed into her outdoor shoes, approached the school gate….</p>



<p>“Oh, there you are.” Walking towards her was Arisaka Yorka in her school uniform. “Good timing.”</p>



<p>“…Why is Yor-senpai coming from outside?” Sayu was unaware that Yorka had been absent today. The arrival of her love rival, appearing suddenly before her, intensified the confusion.</p>



<p>“My flight was delayed, and I had planned to take a day off… but then, a reason to be here suddenly came up.”</p>



<p>“It’s already the sixth period, though.”</p>



<p>“I wasn’t planning to attend classes from the beginning,” Yorka said, her long hair flowing as she stood next to Sayu briskly, “Want to chat a bit?”</p>



<p>“But…” Caught in a swirl of guilt, Sayu felt the urge to escape. Yet, she also wanted to talk as much.</p>



<p>Yorka reached out her hand. She could understand Sayu’s conflicted feelings, “Let’s go.”</p>



<p>The two headed towards the courtyard between the school buildings. “Is there something you’d like to drink?”</p>



<p>“Then, hot milk tea.” Yorka bought drinks for both herself and Sayu from a nearby vending machine. They sat on a bench overlooking the courtyard. “Here you go.”</p>



<p>“Thank you,” Sayu hesitated as she accepted the bottle from Yorka. She came here almost involuntarily, but as she sat on the bench, she finally snapped back to reality.</p>



<p><em>What on earth is this situation? </em>She had unexpectedly been caught by Arisaka Yorka on the way home, and now they were alone, talking. Thinking rationally, it was quite an abnormal situation.</p>



<p>The famously unsociable Arisaka Yorka was with someone at school. And that someone happened to be Sayu. Just being next to Yorka, the most famous student in school, drew the attention of passing students who wondered what was happening.</p>



<p>“Yor-senpai, do you like tomato juice?”</p>



<p>Yorka was sipping from a can of tomato juice. Sayu brought up the first topic that caught her eye to fill the silence.</p>



<p>“Just felt like making up for the lack of vegetables,” Yorka said, tilting the can quietly. The lingering fatigue from the long flight made the atmosphere around her seemed even more languid than usual.</p>



<p>“You’re taking good care of your appearance, huh?”</p>



<p>“I just ate too much during the trip,” Yorka replied, absentmindedly tracing her waist that showed no signs of excess weight.</p>



<p>“But, Yor-senpai, you’re really slim.” When Sayu gave an innocuous response,</p>



<p>“…I guess talking to me still makes you nervous?” Yorka inquired with an enigmatic look, setting the can aside.</p>



<p>“Well, we didn’t talk much during karaoke the other day.”</p>



<p>“I don’t mean to be intimidating.”</p>



<p>“It’s impossible not to feel nervous around you, Yor-senpai.”</p>



<p>“You don’t need to be so on guard.”</p>



<p>Despite Yorka’s attempt to be considerate, it was an unreasonable request for Sayu right now. </p>



<p><em>Does Yor-senpai know about my exchange with Ki-senpai this morning? Is she here to express discontent about it?</em> Sweat formed on Sayu’s back as her mind spun in circles. She meticulously examined every word, trying to fathom Yorka’s true intentions.</p>



<p>“Your milk tea will get cold.”</p>



<p>“Ah, y-yes!” Prompted, Sayu finally took a sip from the bottle. The gentle sweetness of the milk tea spread and eased her tension slightly.</p>



<p>“Don’t be so stiff. You’re even more awkward than during karaoke last time.” Yorka, who rarely spoke with classmates other than Kisumi, typically conversed in this awkward manner with anyone else. Even with some familiarity, Sayu found it perplexing how much pressure Yorka unintentionally imposed on others.</p>



<p>Both being overly cautious, their conversation came to a halt. On a May afternoon, two girls sat in silence on a bench in the courtyard. The flowerbed in the center bloomed with spring flowers like nemophila and tulips, pleasing the eyes.</p>



<p>“Um, Yor-senpai! Why did you approach me?” Unable to endure the silence, Sayu straightforwardly inquired. She was ready for rebuke or blame. The woman present here had every right to do so. Moreover, she had done something to Yorka’s boyfriend that she could do nothing even if she was reprimanded.</p>



<p>Sayu bit her lip, patiently waiting for Yorka’s response.</p>



<p>“Well, I thought if I talked to you, we might become friends.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that reason too pure!?”</p>



<p>The unexpected reply prompted Sayu to raise her voice unintentionally. She felt a sense of defeat, wondering if this special and stunning girl was beautiful even at heart.</p>



<p>As she collapsed backward onto the bench, her hand accidentally hit Yorka’s tomato juice, causing it to spill significantly.</p>



<p>“Ah, sorry! Did it splash on your uniform? Is it stained?”</p>



<p>“It didn’t get on me, so it’s fine.”</p>



<p>“I’ll buy a new one right away!”</p>



<p>A red puddle spread on the ground. Sayu, now panicked, quickly got up.</p>



<p>“──Hey, Sayu-chan, did you confess to Kisumi?”</p>



<p>Suddenly probed about the core issue, Sayu froze as if nailed to the spot. Then, with a resigned expression, she relaxed her body and sat back on the bench.</p>



<p>“Did you know?”</p>



<p>“Just a wild guess.”</p>



<p>“You got it right.” Sayu admitted nonchalantly.</p>



<p>“Got it.”</p>



<p>“Are you supposed to be happy about that?”</p>



<p>Yorka’s nonchalant attitude disarmed Sayu’s vigilance and bitterness. </p>



<p>“Well, doesn’t it feel relieving when someone else puts your true feelings into words? You’d be thinking, ‘<em>ah, I can’t keep secrets from this person.’</em> Hinaka-chan taught me that. If it makes you uncomfortable, I won’t ask anything.”</p>



<p>When Yorka impulsively broke up with Kisumi, Miyauchi Hinaka came to her rescue. She, too, liked the same person and motivated Yorka even when she was feeling down. Yorka now aspired to be that support for someone else.</p>



<p>“…Can I confess something?”</p>



<p>“You’re making it sound dramatic.”</p>



<p>“Just listen.” With resolve, Sayu spoke up. “I’m the one who started the rumor about Yor-senpai coming home in the morning.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I knew that.”</p>



<p>“Huh?”</p>



<p>This time, incomprehension took over. Arisaka Yorka had indeed said she ‘knew.’</p>



<p>“I hate being stared by others, so I’m sensitive to other people’s gazes.”</p>



<p>“Since when?”</p>



<p>“That Saturday morning when Kisumi saw me off at the station.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t that from the beginning!?”</p>



<p>“I felt like someone was watching me intensely. But at that time, I was with Kisumi and in good spirits, so I didn’t mind it much.”</p>



<p>“The power of love is indeed grand,” Sayu couldn’t help but murmur.</p>



<p>“The second time was when I came out of the student guidance room. I felt a familiar gaze in the corridor, though I couldn’t recall when I’d felt that gaze before.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I was secretly waiting for Ki-senpai.”</p>



<p>At that point, Sayu didn’t think she had been noticed.</p>



<p>“I only realized you were the one behind that gaze when we met at karaoke.”</p>



<p>“Was I that obvious?”</p>



<p>“Your feelings of hating me were leaking out as much as your feelings for Kisumi,” Yorka recalled and couldn’t help but smile.</p>



<p>“You’re too perceptive, Senpai.”</p>



<p>Thinking about Yorka’s sensitivity, Sayu felt that living with such heightened awareness wasn’t easy.</p>



<p>“I saw you looking at Kisumi with the same eyes I did. That’s why I immediately knew you like him.”</p>



<p>“You knew about my feelings for Ki-senpai and how I spread the rumor, yet you silently let me stay close…”</p>



<p>“Because Kisumi also likes you.”</p>



<p>Those words further torment Sayu’s vulnerable heart. Unlike Sayu, who was trapped in the past, Yorka only saw the present and the future.</p>



<p>“Do you know you have the right to confront me? Why don’t you say anything?”</p>



<p>“I’m not interested in playing detective. Besides, it would only trouble Kisumi.” Yorka remained unyielding. She was not interested in her surroundings to begin with, and bringing up things that had ended in her mind would be nothing but a hassle.</p>



<p>As long as it didn’t inconvenience Sena Kisumi, she was content.</p>



<p>“Aren’t you angry? Don’t you hate me? I caused you so much trouble. Depending on how things went, you two might have even broken up.”</p>



<p>“But Kisumi resolved it.”</p>



<p>“────!!’</p>



<p>She truly was on another level. This girl, drawing attention with her extraordinary beauty, effortlessly balanced her emotions solely on trust for the one she loved.</p>



<p>She meant it. This wasn’t some fleeting romance destined to end as a page in the book of youth. It wasn’t a dream or a fantasy but a love grounded in reality, one that looked toward the future.</p>



<p>“Moreover, announcing our relationship isn’t so bad,” Yorka admitted shyly, “For a girl, it feels good to be treated specially by someone you like.”</p>



<p>Sayu felt the tension leaving her body, and her response became lighter.</p>



<p>“That’s how it is. At first, I panicked and wonder what he was doing, but he probably tried to protect me by telling everyone.”</p>



<p>“If it’s because of some boring possessiveness, that would be a different story, but it’s Ki-senpai we’re talking about. It must have taken quite some courage.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. That’s why I’m happy now.”</p>



<p>“You really like Ki-senpai, do you?”</p>



<p>“I do.” Seeing Yorka’s expression of a maiden deeply in love, Sayu no longer felt the need to compete. This beautiful girl loved the man she liked without a shred of doubt.</p>



<p>It was a total defeat. Sayu finally acknowledged that she could put an end to this long one-sided love.</p>



<p>As she awoke from the unrealized dream of love, tears welled up in her eyes.</p>



<p>“Uh, uh, uwaahhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh!”</p>



<p>She cried out, pouring her emotions into the sobs as tears flowing endlessly. No matter how loudly she shouted or how many tears fell, the ache in her heart refused to fade away.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/1000010025.png" alt="" /></div></figure>
</figure>



<p>She loved him. She always had. Just thinking about him made her heart flutter. Every trivial exchanges brought her joy. His daily ritual of picking her up felt special. She wished they could take a longer route to school while they were alone.</p>



<p>During club practices, his casual encouragement saved her. When she was tired during matches, his voice gave her renewed energy. The detours on the way home were enjoyable. It made her happy when he earnestly listened to her complaints. She even pretended to need help with studying, she wanted to be with him more, more, and more──</p>



<p>“I also wanted to be special to Ki-senpai. But his kindness wasn’t just for me… And, his kindness towards you was different. Completely different.”</p>



<p>“Yeah.”</p>



<p>“And, although you’re so beautiful, you’re also kind.” Even while sniffing her nose, she managed to speak.</p>



<p>“Because you and I love the same person.”</p>



<p>“I’m a girl who confessed to him while you were traveling abroad. I would hate myself if I were you.”</p>



<p>“I’m used to girls confessing to Kisumi when I’m not around,” Yorka casually complained about Kisumi’s popularity.</p>



<p>“Eh!? From who!?”</p>



<p>“Hasekura-san and Hinaka-chan.”</p>



<p>“Even Miyauchi-senpai!? Huh, no way! Why was Ki-senpai casually doing karaoke with them? Did his head get messed up after dating Yor-senpai? You even established the Sena Club!”</p>



<p>“What do you mean?” Yorka frowned, clearly displeased.</p>



<p>“Even though they’ve been rejected, you actually get along with each other…”</p>



<p>Learning this shocking revelation, her tears retreated. With widened, teary eyes, she belatedly realized how unique that karaoke gathering had been.</p>



<p>“That’s why, I don’t care if another kouhai likes Kisumi now.”</p>



<p>“Wow, talk about confidence from the main wife.”</p>



<p>“I don’t have confidence.”</p>



<p>“You don’t seem that way,” Sayu replied sincerely, without a hint of sarcasm.</p>



<p>“Maybe I’m okay with Kisumi cheating on me,” Yorka said this while gazing into the distance.</p>



<p>“…That’s the kind of line you can say because you’re absolutely sure you won’t be cheated on.”</p>



<p>Confronted with this ultimate nonchalant statement, Sayu couldn’t help but find her own attempt at a love coup suddenly absurd and burst into laughter.</p>
