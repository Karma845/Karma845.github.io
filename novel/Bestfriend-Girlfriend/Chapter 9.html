<h1>Chapter 9: Gal and Preferred Type</h1>


<p>The morning after I went to McDonald’s with Tsumakawa. In the classroom before homeroom.</p>

<p>” …… “</p>

<p>I slumped at my desk, alone in my thoughts, and screamed in my head, ‘Nooooooo!’</p>
<p>I messed up, I messed up, I messed up, I messed up, I messed up, I messed up—</p>
<p>To tell the truth, at the time of yesterday, I didn’t regret my actions much. There were no lies in the words I spoke to her…</p>
<p>Besides, I thought I could talk about that kind of stuff with her, while properly hiding ‘true feelings that I shouldn’t have said’ within me.</p>
<p>However, after a night had passed since then, when I thought back to yesterday’s events——</p>

<p>『It’s not about others. It’s because I haven’t accepted myself. As long as I think that way, I’ll probably never become Tsumakawa-san’s friend…』</p>

<p>Ahhhhh, it’s so creepy! This guy even said things he shouldn’t say to Tsumakawa-san!</p>
<p>——Someone gives me a time machine! If I could go back in time, I’d beat up my past self and prevent him from saying embarrassing things to Tsumakawa-san!</p>
<p>But regrets come too late… Since I didn’t have a Doraemon-like friend, all I could do was move forward in time like this—just the usual routine of going to school.</p>
<p>Why can’t we take days off when we want to? Is school some kind of black company?</p>

<p>Thinking about such things, I was napping at my desk, and suddenly—my left shoulder was lightly tapped.</p>
<p>So, reluctantly raising my face, I found… the dazzling her standing there, offering a gal peace sign in my direction.</p>

<p>“Yay! Good Morning, Yoda — Gal Peace Feat Early Morning!”</p>
<p>“Is that the right way to use the word feat? … G-Good morning, Tsumakawa-san…”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? You seem less energetic than usual. Maybe you’re embarrassed because of what happened yesterday??”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“Hit the mark, huh? Well, what you said yesterday was… well, it was kind of embarrassing. I mean, you were saying some pretty ridiculous stuff yesterday, Nezumayo! It’s like there’s a part of Nezumayo inside Yoda that just exploded and couldn’t be stopped! Ahaha, it’s funny!”</p>
<p>” ……… “</p>
<p>“…Ah, sorry. I thought teasing you would turn it into a funny story, but judging by your expression, it doesn’t seem like you find it funny?—But you know, you don’t really need to worry about it. Sure, Yoda was pretty down yesterday, but everyone has moments when they feel that way, right? It’s precisely in those times that you need someone to lean on — in the case of yesterday’s Yoda, it was me. Since you were able to do that just fine yesterday, you don’t need to reflect on how you felt yesterday when you were feeling down!”!”</p>

<p>…Perhaps Tsumakawa-san isn’t very good at comforting people?</p>
<p>While understanding that she was genuinely concerned about me, I couldn’t help but think that way.</p>
<p>In cases like this, she should have comforted me while hiding the part about yesterday’s ‘Yoda being down yesterday’, right?</p>
<p>As I was pondering this, Tsumakawa continued to smile and said.</p>

<p>“Anyway, since we talked about yesterday, can I try something?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Try something? Try what?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Yoda. How about you go home with me today?”</p>
<p>” ………. “</p>

<p>When Tsumakawa said this with a mischievous expression, what flashed back in my mind was something I said yesterday—</p>

<p>『Actively being with Tsumakawa-san from my side might still be beyond me… but from now on. I won’t use the excuse that real-life girls suck to reject being with you anymore…』</p>

<p>Although I had somewhat declared this, I still found myself looking for reasons not to go home with Tsumakawa-san…</p>
<p>However, I realized that all the excuses I quickly came up with were just forced reasons to decline her invitation!</p>
<p>So, when Tsumakawa suggested, ‘How about you go home with me today?’ I reluctantly nodded.</p>

<p>“…Ah, okay.”</p>
<p>“Really!? As expected, you’re being honest just like you promised! Good job, good job!”</p>
<p>“Seriously… Don’t rub someone’s head like he’s a dog! This is the classroom!”</p>
<p>“Hehe, what if we weren’t in the classroom? Well, later—when we’re not in the classroom, could we be alone and do lots of head patting?”</p>
<p>“T-t-that’s not what I meant!?”</p>

<p>While Tsumakawa playfully rubbed my head, I retorted.</p>
<p>Lately, her physical affection had been quite intense…</p>
<p>Could it be that she’s mistaken me for a frequent visitor to cabaret clubs or something? No matter how much she touched me, did she think I could stay with a glass of water for hours?</p>
<p>*****</p>
<p>And then, time passed, and it was after school.</p>
<p>Just as we had agreed this morning, I was walking with Tsumakawa-san to the nearest station from our high school.</p>

<p>I commute to school by bicycle and Tsumakawa commutes by train. Since we would part ways at the school’s nearest station, I didn’t really see much point in walking home together.</p>
<p>As I was thinking about this, Tsumakawa suddenly pointed to a park slightly off the path we usually took and suggested,</p>

<p>“Hey, let’s stop by there for a bit.”</p>
<p>“…I guess that’s fine, but Tsumakawa-san, don’t you have work today?”</p>
<p>“I still have about an hour left, so it’s fine. Let’s go!”</p>

<p>With just those words, she walked into the park without waiting for me.</p>
<p>It was a fairly large park with lush green lawns spread across a wide area, a place frequented by local children and the elderly, serving as a recreational spot.</p>

<p>In a corner of the park, there was a roofed bench, and that’s where Tsumakawa headed.</p>
<p>She sat down there, then patted the seat beside her with her left hand and smiled.</p>
<p>So, after parking my bike near the bench… I sat down, making sure to keep a space of about one person’s width between me and the place where she was sitting.</p>

<p>” …..”</p>

<p>Then, without a word, she moved closer to me, readjusting her position so that our shoulders were snugly pressed together.</p>
<p>Her soft thigh slightly against mine, her delicate arm slightly touching my upper arm.</p>


<p>As I was feeling puzzled, Tsumakawa, who seemed to notice my confusion, suddenly asked a question.</p>

<p>“By the way, Yoda, what kind of girl do you like?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that question a bit sudden?… Well, lately, let’s see— someone like Ai Yashajin from ‘The Ryuo’s Work Is Never Done’ might be my type, I guess.”</p>
<p>“You’re answering with a 2D character again… Huh? Wait, Ai Yashajin from The Ryuo’s Work Is Never Done is like, an actual kid, right? I think her age is——”</p>
<p>“She’s nine years old.”</p>
<p>“Wow, you’re a total lolicon, huh? I mean… when it comes to answering about your type of girl, you’re the most unreasonable person I’ve ever heard of. Isn’t the only solution to Benjamin Button it?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s a joke, of course.——I mean, let’s just call it a joke.”</p>
<p>“You mean you’re not joking?!”</p>
<p>“Ahaha, if I answer seriously, my type of girl would be… someone with long black hair and a sharp tongue, I guess? Well, in reality, I don’t think there are any amazing girls like Hitagi Senjougahara or Yukino Yukinoshita around…”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>(TN: ‘Benjamin Button it’ is a phrase that refers to the concept of aging in reverse, similar to the story ‘The Curious Case of Benjamin Button’. She’s saying she needs to reverse in age.)</p>

<p>In response to my statement, Tsumakawa-san stared intently at her hair, now beautifully brown.</p>
<p>While twirling it with her fingers, she suddenly gave me a sharp glare.</p>

<p>“By the way, Yoda-kun. Your scent stinks too much. Perhaps you rinse yourself in the drain this morning——I wonder?”</p>
<p>“Sudden verbal assault, huh!? It was so out of the blue that my emotional guard couldn’t keep up, and it hurt pretty bad…”</p>
<p>“Or perhaps you ate in a public restroom——I wonder?”</p>
<p>“What kind of outrageous insult is this? Can I start a lawsuit against her!?”</p>
<p>“No way! Please don’t take me to the court——I wonder?! “</p>
<p>“Poisonous-tongued people who get scared by their opponent’s counterattack… If you’re going to be sarcastic, then stay consistent. Don’t lose to the other side’s arguments.”</p>

<p>After saying this, I looked at Tsumakawa-san.</p>
<p>She coolly brushed her hair aside and said, ‘I don’t mind staring at you, but I wish you wouldn’t stare at me so much.’ with a mysterious expression.</p>
<p>I threw my suspicions at her.</p>

<p>“By the way, Tsumakawa-san, what was that poison-tongued remarks just now…”</p>
<p>“How’s that? Can I become the type of girl that Yoda likes?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know… I got the impression that a black-haired, sharp-tongued girl in Tsumakawa-san’s imagination tends to end sentences with ‘ka shira (I wonder),’ but…”</p>
<p>“Should I wish for Yoda-kun to die right now——I wonder?”</p>

<p>That’s not even a poisonous tongue anymore; that’s just plain mean! How cruel…</p>

<p>“Yoda, I, I’m sorry. I don’t really want you to die…I wonder…”</p>

<p>As she said this, Tsumakawa-san gently stroked my right hand.</p>
<p>I get it, it’s just a joke, but please stop with the constant physical contact…!</p>
<p>While thinking this, I gently removed my hand from hers and continued the conversation.</p>

<p>“Well, well, Tsumakawa-san… It’s impossible to change character so suddenly now. I already understand that Tsumakawa-san isn’t the kind of Gal who would poison-tongue me, and besides, when I said my type was a black-haired, sharp-tongued girl, you sort of recreated that and it did actually hurt, so maybe that kind of girl is not my type in reality.”</p>
<p>“Well then, what is your type? I read a ton of light novels, so I can become many types of girls. If you want, I can even transform into the complete opposite of a Gal, like a pure and innocent type. ——Oh dear, I am the pure and innocent Miona right now.”</p>
<p>“Oh dear, I am the pure and innocent Miona!? Isn’t that more of an Ojou-sama rather than pure and innocent?”</p>
<p>“Today, I have plans to enjoy some herbal tea on the terrace while indulging in reading a few light novels.”</p>
<p>“An Ojou-sama reading light novels on a terrace… A light novel-loving Ojou-sama seems like a very interesting character…”</p>
<p>“After that, I intend to engage in a lively exchange of replies on social media with fellow Twitter users. Today, I shall use my replies to silence those bothersome individuals once and for all.”</p>
<p>“Don’t cause trouble on social media! Are you an internet keyboard warrior or what? …Just a note, adding ‘o’ in front of everything doesn’t make your words milder, okay?”</p>
<p>“Be silent, you fool. If you make too much noise, I’ll end you.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that just Lord Frieza! What, you’re not an Ojou-sama; you’re actually Lord Frieza! ——And actually, quite early on, you seem to have stopped being a pure and innocent type!”</p>

<p>As I retorted like a comedian from Hara City, Tsumakawa-san burst into laughter with genuine amusement, saying, ‘Ahahaha, that’s right!’</p>
<p>While watching her, I also felt like laughing.</p>
<p>Damn, even though she’s a three-dimensional girl, she’s such a fun gal…</p>

<p>After Tsumakawa-san had a good laugh, she lightly smacked my thigh twice.</p>

<p>“Ouch, what are you doing…”</p>
<p>“Uhm… it’s nothing!”</p>

<p>After she said that, she laughed again and then seemed to realize something.</p>

<p>“But hey, even though I tried to become the type of girl you like, isn’t that not okay? I mean, instead of that… Since I’m proud to be a gal, I shouldn’t try to match myself to Yoda’s preferences!”</p>
<p>“Huuh… I don’t really understand what you’re trying to say…”</p>
<p>“In short, I’m trying to influence Yoda to like gals instead! Yoda has an aversion to gals, so I’ll tell you the selling points that can make you like them! Like this!”</p>

<p>Saying this, Tsumakawa-san suddenly linked arms with me.</p>
<p>Since I’d gotten used to her physical contact by now, I wasn’t particularly flustered by this — or so I thought.</p>
<p>But when I measured my own pulse, I realized that my heart was racing all by itself.</p>
<p>Ah, the body sure doesn’t lie!</p>


<p>“For now, let me tell you the selling points that can make Yoda, who seems to have a hard time with gals, like them!</p>

<p>Saying this, Tsumakawa-san removed her hand and took out a tablet from her bag.</p>
<p>Then, she skillfully launched an app and displayed the cover of a certain digital magazine.</p>

<p>The title of that magazine was 『leg』</p>
<p>…On the tablet’s screen, there were eye-catching images of a flashy white gal and a black gal, both in striking poses.</p>
<p>Tsumakawa then pointed to the black gal on the cover and said,</p>
<p>“This is my best friend, Kanachamu! Isn’t she cute? Doesn’t she have an amazing aura?”</p>
<p>“Well… I can’t exactly say she’s not cute, but I can’t exactly say she’s cute either.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, you’re such a hassle… Well, I get it. You’re not interested in her, right? You’re more into this one, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>While saying this, Tsumakawa swiped the tablet and flipped through the pages of the magazine.</p>
<p>Among them was a snap of a gal standing gracefully on a Shibuya street corner… I couldn’t help but gaze intently at the girl on the screen.</p>

<p>Though she had flashy clothing, her makeup was somewhat understated.</p>
<p>She stood with her body slightly turned, bathed in the setting sun’s glow, gazing at us with a smile.</p>

<p>—It wasn’t the usual Tsumakawa-san that I saw at school. It was a different side of her, a professional persona.</p>
<p>She was a first-year high school student fighting in the adult world, a cool and confident Tsumakawa-san.</p>

<p>She’s usually such a cheerful girl, and yet, even though I should have seen the same smile, the one captured in this model’s work and her usual one felt different…</p>
<p>I pondered while observing the photo, and then I noticed a gaze from the side.</p>
<p>I turned to see—Tsumakawa-san grinning broadly as she looked at my profile. What’s with that expression…</p>

<p>“Could it be, Yoda, you finally like me?”</p>
<p>“N-No… it’s not that I like you…”</p>
<p>“Really? I mean, who wouldn’t think that she likes you when she sees you staring at her with that blank expression on your face? …If you want it, I have the physical magazine at home. I can give it to you next time?”</p>
<p>“I-I don’t really want it, so it’s fine…”</p>
<p>“Well, don’t hesitate. I’ll openly bring it to school for you. ——But just to be clear, don’t jerk off to me just because I’m cute, okay?”</p>
<p>“Don’t say jerk off!”</p>

<p>Geez, that’s so explicit! You’re making me embarrassed!</p>
<p>While I was internally reacting like this, Tsumakawa seemed to be deep in thought, her chin resting on her hand. Then she continued:</p>

<p>“…Well, I don’t mind if you get a good shagging from me. Honestly, I’d rather you didn’t get turned on by anyone else. ——So, Yoda, don’t get turned on by anyone other than me, okay?”</p>
<p>“Do you even realize how dirty your words are?”</p>

<p>Receiving my retort, Tsumakawa laughed again, looking amused.</p>
<p>Seriously, gals have nothing but mischievous remarks to pester introverts with… I thought, and then she spoke in her energetic voice.</p>

<p>“Well, for starters, here’s a gal’s selling point: ‘Being cute!’ “</p>
<p>“…I don’t disagree that Tsumakawa-san is cute, but it’s impressive that you can say it confidently.”</p>
<p>“Well, I am cuter than most girls around here, right? Besides, since I make a job out of being cute, I put effort into it. Look at her… I’m winning, winning, overwhelmingly winning!”</p>
<p>“Stop being so arrogant and pointing at all the girls on their way out of school——we all have to live without saying these things! “</p>
<p>“Well, you know, when you’re living in a group, it’s important to be considerate in your actions. But I’ve decided not to live like that.”</p>
<p>“Th-This gal… She’s so self-assured…!”</p>
<p>“Come on, Yoda, you do it too. Who’s winning?”</p>
<p>“…You’re winning.”</p>

<p>When Tsumakawa pointed at a passing female student and then at herself, asking which of them was winning, I pointed to Tsumakawa-san and said so.</p>
<p>In response, she raised her excitement and started patting my head, saying, ‘Yay! I’m really happy when you praised me like that, Yoda!’</p>

<p>…I hope she doesn’t misunderstand, but I didn’t point at her because I wanted her to like me, okay?</p>
<p>It’s just that I couldn’t lie and say ‘Tsumakawa is not as cute,’ so I said it… It might sound a bit tsundere, but it’s the truth, really!</p>
<p>I thought as I smoothed down my hair that she had messed up, continuing my words.</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t mean to be a judge, but in the first place, there’s no winning or losing in appearance, you know? People looking cute to others is ultimately a matter of personal preference; cute and cool people are just perceived that way by a larger number of people….which means handsome men don’t exist in this world. And in other words, I don’t envy Horito at all. I just wish handsome men would be charged more consumption tax than us.”</p>
<p>“Uh, what kind of national policy is that? Isn’t that driven by personal grudges?”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa was exasperated by my remark, but I genuinely thought this way.</p>
<p>Since handsome men have an advantage in terms of looks, they should balance that out somewhere else.</p>
<p>Well, if that’s the case, maybe we should give a monetary gift to all the unattractive people in the country…</p>
<p>Ugh, I don’t want to stand in line at an unattractive people’s monetary gift distribution though…</p>


<p>Anyway, after discussing that, a few tens of minutes passed.</p>
<p>Even after that, Tsumakawa inexplicably listed several selling points of gals to me.</p>

<p>『They have good fashion sense.』</p>
<p>『They have a sincere personality.』</p>
<p>『They can become friends with anyone.』</p>

<p>And after mentioning these strengths, she continued with a somewhat bewitching smile.</p>

<p>“Alright, I’m going to give you a top-notch selling point now. Gals are… promiscuous!”</p>
<p>“H-Hey, saying something like that… Are you even allowed to say that as a gal?”</p>
<p>“Well, my gal friends often say I’m ‘too conservative.’ But, there are many gals like that. I’m okay with things like dirty jokes, too.”</p>
<p>“Oh, I know that.”</p>
<p>“But M-Miona is too embarrassed to say p*nis…”</p>
<p>“You’re saying it just fine though…”</p>

<p>In response to my retort, Tsumakawa laughed heartily.</p>
<p>Then, she started casually rubbing my right thigh(?) with a natural motion and spoke as if it was no big deal.</p>

<p>“Even someone as conservative as me… If it’s Yoda, I could let you…rub my breasts?”</p>
<p>“…Ha?”</p>
<p>“Uh, I’m being serious here… Of course, if Yoda wants to. If you were to ask me, ‘Can I touch Tsumakawa-san’s breasts?’ I’d answer hesitantly, ‘I guess it’s okay.’ Because, you know, I kinda like you, Yoda…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“What will you do? Want to try touching them?”</p>

<p>As she said that, Tsumakawa stared at me with upturned eyes.</p>
<p>She had brought this up out of nowhere, yet her cheeks were strangely flushed like a ripe apple.</p>
<p>No, what’s with this sudden situation…seriously…</p>

<p>Come to think of it, although it’s a bit late to realize, Tsumakawa today seemed somewhat different from usual.</p>
<p>She’s quite close in terms of personal space, but it’s not ‘very’ close like usual, so it took me a while to notice…</p>
<p>But to be told I can touch her breasts, that’s something she never said before.</p>
<p>I contemplated while unintentionally glancing at Tsumakawa’s chest.</p>
<p>…Seeing those ample assets in front of me, I realized that my male instincts soar (figuratively speaking).</p>
<p>If I were to put my honest thoughts into words, I wanted to touch them.</p>
<p>Of course, I wanted to touch them… but I couldn’t imagine that I, who thinks I can’t become friends with Tsumakawa-san, would actually have such a manly choice here——</p>

<p>Choose!</p>
<p>① 【Touch them】</p>
<p>②【Don’t touch them】</p>
<p>③ 【While squeezing her breasts, shout with all my might, ‘Hmm, just the right amount of squishiness!’】</p>

<p>Among the three choices that popped into my mind, I had no option but to choose ②… and seriously, what’s up with the ③ choice? Are you kidding me?</p>
<p>Am I in ‘NouCome’ or what? I used to love that show.</p>
<p>(TN: Ore no Nounai Sentakushi ga, Gakuen Love Come o Zenryoku de Jama Shiteiru.)</p>

<p>In this way, I inserted a little joke to calm myself down and took a deep breath again.</p>
<p>After that, as if letting go of some lingering thoughts, I said to Tsumakawa-san:</p>

<p>“…For now, I’ll refuse…”</p>
<p>“What do you mean ‘for now’?”</p>
<p>“What’s with ‘for now,’ damn it?!”</p>

<p>It was such a pathetic way to escape. It’s not like there’s a bunch of lingering regrets or anything!</p>

<p>Well, as a twisted otaku, I still felt that it would not okay to somehow squeeze her breasts right now…</p>
<p>So, with a single tear (!?) dropping from my right eye, I looked up at the sky, now tinged with a deep red color——.</p>

<p>While I was feeling down like that, I heard a sigh from beside me, ‘Phew…’</p>
<p>So, naturally, I turned my gaze in that direction… and met eyes with Tsumakawa-san, flapping her hands over her flushed face.</p>

<p>“…Even though I told you it’s okay to touch them, somehow, I felt relieved when Yoda said no… Ahaha…”</p>
<p>“So, what you’re saying is, in other words, Tsumakawa-san didn’t actually want her breasts touched—so if I had chosen to touch them, you would have scolded me? …Wait, was this a trap?!”</p>
<p>“H-Hey, it’s not a trap! Probably, I really was going to let you touch them… I might have shed a few tears while Yoda was touching them, but——”</p>
<p>“Doesn’t that make me look bad if I actually touched them? “</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know why… Somehow, was I forcing myself somewhere? I really do think that I’d be okay with Yoda touching me… Or rather, I might have some desire to be touched by you too, I guess—but if Yoda were to touch me now, it might just be because you wanted my body, and that could have made me feel sad too…”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“Well, saying all this probably won’t make sense to you, right? Actually, I don’t really understand it either… Even though friends shouldn’t really think about wanting their breasts touched, somehow I feel strange today…”</p>
<p>“That’s so true!”</p>
<p>“No, you should deny it!”</p>

<p>After saying that with a somewhat troubled expression, Tsumakawa-san returned to her usual smile and gently squeezed my shoulder…</p>
<p>I couldn’t figure out how Tsumakawa’s little joke had led to this result, shaking both me and her.</p>
<p>Amidst all this, the time was slightly before 6 p.m. Tsumakawa-san seemed to have a modeling job after this, so it might be better for her to head home soon…</p>
<p>Just as I thought something like that, she gazed at the sinking sunset and muttered.</p>

<p>“…but I’m still not in love yet——”</p>

<p>I couldn’t understand the meaning behind those words.</p>
<p>However, her profile, lit up by the orange-colored setting sun, was so beautiful that I couldn’t help but be captivated by it.</p>
