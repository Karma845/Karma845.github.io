<h2>Chapter 9: Shimizu-san and the Unexpected Visitor</h2>

<p>“I just got a message that Yuasa-sensei will be here in about an hour.”</p>
<p>“Is it that time already?”</p>
<p>“I’m really looking forward to the actual stargazing!”</p>
<p>“I hope we can see the stars clearly.”</p>
<p>“They said it’s going to be clear skies today on the weather forecast, so I think we’ll be fine.”</p>
<p>“Wow! Mio-chan, you even checked the weather forecast; you must be really looking forward to it!”</p>
<p>“I was just a little curious.”</p>
<p>“Really, Mio-chan is just like Kei, not being honest!”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t suddenly drag me around.”</p>

<p>Just as everyone was getting restless because the time for stargazing was approaching, my phone suddenly rang.</p>

<p>“Excuse me, I need to take this call.”</p>
<p>“Okay, be back soon.”</p>

<p>I stepped out into the hallway to find out that the call was from my father.</p>
<p>My parents, of course, knew I’d be out today, so I had no idea why he was calling.</p>
<p>I decided to answer the phone anyway.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dad?”</p>
<p>“Ah, good, you answered.”</p>
<p>“What’s going on?”</p>
<p>“Have you seen Teruno around there?”</p>
<p>“Huh? No, she’s not here. Why are you asking?”</p>
<p>“Teruno left a note saying she’s going to bring ‘Onii-chan’ back and has gone missing.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>

<p>I was so taken aback that my brain couldn’t process it immediately.</p>

<p>“Knowing Teruno, I really think she might have gone to your high school. So if Teruno comes to where you are, let me know.”</p>
<p>“O-okay.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, I know you’re having fun.”</p>
<p>“No, it’s good you told me. Should I watch the school gates to see if Teruno shows up?”</p>
<p>“It would be bad if you missed each other. Just stay where you are, Daiki.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>
<p>“If Teruno gives up halfway and comes back home, we’ll contact you again.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’m counting on you.”</p>

<p>Then the call ended. Why is Teruno trying to take me home?</p>
<p>Reflecting on it, Teruno did seem a bit different than usual today. Just before leaving, it felt like Teruno was trying to tell me something.</p>

<p>(What is Teruno thinking?)</p>

<p>The only way to find out is to ask her directly. For now, I decided to return to the clubroom.</p>

<p>“Ah, Daiki-kun, you’re back.”</p>
<p>“Sorry for stepping out so suddenly.”</p>
<p>“You have a phone call, so it’s not a problem at all. By the way, can I ask what the call was about?”</p>
<p>“Well, it seems like my sister is trying to come here for some reason.”</p>
<p>“Huh? What do you mean?”</p>

<p>Ai-san tilts her head.</p>
<p>I guess it would be hard to understand without context.</p>

<p>“I don’t know the details, but it seems she’s trying to take me home…”</p>
<p>“Now I’m even more confused. Your sister is Teruno-chan, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>
<p>“Is she cuter than Kei?”</p>
<p>“Hey.”</p>
<p>“Well, jokes aside, do you have any idea why Teruno-chan is trying to take you home?”</p>
<p>“Uhh…”</p>

<p>I thought about it but couldn’t come up with a reason.</p>

<p>“…I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“In that case, we’ll just have to ask her when she gets here.”</p>

<p>Just then, the sound of the clubroom door slowly opening caught our attention. We turned to look.</p>

<p>“Teruno!”</p>

<p>There, peeking through the slightly open door, was Teruno.</p>
<p>She looked a bit surprised when she heard my voice, then hesitantly entered the room.</p>

<p>“Cute! Are you Teruno-chan by any chance?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes…”</p>
<p>“Sorry, did I scare you? I’m Ai Shimizu. Feel free to call me Ai-chan.”</p>
<p>“Yes…”</p>

<p>Teruno was completely on guard.</p>
<p>She becomes cautious when she’s in a place full of people she doesn’t know.</p>

<p>“Teruno, Dad was worried.”</p>
<p>“I left a message saying I was going to Onii-chan’s place.”</p>
<p>“Even so, everyone will worry if you suddenly disappear. Anyway, I’m glad you’re actually here. I’ll call Dad now so he can bring you back home.”</p>
<p>“…No.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I won’t. Onii-chan should come home with me too.”</p>

<p>It’s not unusual for Teruno to be demanding, but this level of stubbornness feels unusual.</p>

<p>“Don’t say that. I’ll go home after we finish stargazing.”</p>
<p>“No, go home with me right now.”</p>
<p>“Why are you saying this?”</p>
<p>“Because Onii-chan…”</p>
<p>“Hey, Hondō’s sister, don’t make things difficult for Hondō.”</p>
<p>“…Who’s this scary person?”</p>

<p>Teruno’s voice is considerably lower than usual—a clear sign she’s in a bad mood.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry, she’s not scary. This is Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“…I understand.”</p>
<p>“Teruno?”</p>
<p>“I understand. This scary woman forcefully invited Onii-chan to go stargazing. Onii-chan is too kind to refuse, so he’s here even though he doesn’t want to be…”</p>
<p>“Teruno!”</p>

<p>I was surprised at how loud my own voice was.</p>

<p>“O-Onii-chan?”</p>
<p>“Apologize to Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“W-Why? I haven’t done anything wrong…”</p>
<p>“Apologize.”</p>
<p>“Onii-chan…”</p>

<p>The next moment, Teruno suddenly turned toward the door and ran out.</p>

<p>“Teruno!”</p>

<p>I hastily followed her into the hallway, but Teruno was already gone.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, I have to go find Teruno.”</p>
<p>“Wait.”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry, Shimizu-san, but I have to go find Teruno quickly…”</p>
<p>“Do you have any idea where your sister might go?”</p>

<p>I was stumped by the question. She’s right, I had no idea where Teruno might have gone.</p>

<p>“Well…no, I don’t.”</p>
<p>“…I’ll go too.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I’ll go with you to search for her. I mean, this happened partly because I carelessly spoke to your sister.”</p>
<p>“This has nothing to do with you, Shimizu-san…”</p>
<p>“You once came looking for someone’s mother even though you had nothing to do with her. Besides, the more people we have, the faster we’ll find her.”</p>

<p>It’s true that searching with multiple people is far more efficient than doing it alone.</p>

<p>“That’s right, that’s why I’ll help too.”</p>
<p>“I’ll help as well.”</p>
<p>“Of course, count me in.”</p>
<p>“Ai-san, Seto-san, Yousuke-san…”</p>
<p>“At a time like this, you should rely on others. You’re always helping others, after all.”</p>

<p>Is that so? I always feel like I’m the one being helped.</p>
<p>But if Shimizu-san says so, maybe that’s true.</p>

<p>“…Thank you, Shimizu-san. Can I count on your help?”</p>
<p>“Sure, leave it to me.”</p>

<p>And so, we all set out to find Teruno.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Teruno’s POV</strong></p>

<p>“Ugh, stupid Onii-chan…”</p>

<p>I couldn’t hold back my tears.</p>
<p>As the sun began to set, I found myself crying all alone.</p>
<p>I knew I was the one at fault. I got anxious on my own, came to the high school on my own, and spoke out of turn.</p>
<p>It’s no wonder Onii-chan got mad.</p>
<p>Even if my head understood that, my heart couldn’t accept it.</p>
<p>I had always believed that Onii-chan would be on my side, no matter what.</p>

<p>(It’s the first time I’ve ever seen Onii-chan so angry…)</p>

<p>As far as I can remember, no matter how selfish I had been, I had never been scolded like this.</p>

<p>(It’s because I spoke ill of that woman, isn’t it…)</p>

<p>A woman with long, beautiful black hair who seemed harsh and intimidating.</p>
<p>She must be relieved that I got scolded by Onii-chan…</p>
<p>Just as I was thinking this, I heard footsteps.</p>

<p>“Wh-Who’s there?”</p>

<p>The person who appeared was not who I was waiting for.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“Found you.”</p>

<p>How long had it been since the Astronomy Club began the search?</p>
<p>I finally found the person I was looking for.</p>

<p>“Yo-You’re scary….”</p>
<p>“Who are you calling scary?”</p>

<p>Being found intimidating isn’t particularly unusual for me and I don’t mind it much, but it’s a little more complicated when someone say it directly to me.</p>

<p>“How did you know I was here?”</p>
<p>“Back in my first year, I used to look for secluded places to skip classes. This was one of them.”</p>
<p>“…you’re scary and a bad person.”</p>
<p>“Well, I’m not exactly a good person.”</p>

<p>If I were a good person, I wouldn’t have come here ‘alone’ and found Hondō’s sister.</p>

<p>“So, why are you here?”</p>
<p>“What do you think I’m here for?”</p>
<p>“To laugh at pitiful me…”</p>

<p>It seems her impression of myself was worse than I had thought.</p>

<p>“I’m not that bad. I was asked by Hondō to find you. Come on, let’s head back to the clubroom. Hondō is worried about you.”</p>
<p>“…I’m not going back.”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>
<p>“I said I’m not going back. Onii-chan is probably still mad at me…”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>I sat down a short distance away from Hondō’s sister.</p>

<p>“You’re not going to force me to go?”</p>
<p>“What good would that do? But I will report that I found you. Hondō is worried, after all.”</p>
<p>“…Fine.”</p>

<p>I took out my smartphone and reported to Ai that I had found her.</p>
<p>The reason I didn’t contact Hondō directly is simply that I don’t have his contact information. Ai probably does.</p>
<p>I saw that my message was read and was asked about the location, but I simply typed that we would be returning together and put away my phone.</p>

<p>“Can I ask you something?”</p>
<p>“Wh-What is it?”</p>
<p>“Why did you try to take Hondō home?”</p>

<p>It seemed like Hondō’s sister was contemplating whether she should talk about it to me.</p>

<p>“Ah, if you don’t want to talk about it, just ignore it. I’m just killing time.”</p>

<p>Hearing this, she looked surprised for a moment, then shook her head.</p>

<p>“No, I’ll talk. It might take a while, is that okay?”</p>
<p>“Sure, talk as much as you want.”</p>
<p>“Alright, then let me explain…”</p>

<p>To summarize what Hondō’s sister said:</p>
<p>Hondō’s parents were busy with work, and it wasn’t uncommon for them to come home late on weekdays.</p>
<p>Even so, she never really felt lonely because Hondō, her brother, would always play with her.</p>
<p>When she was sick, he’d nurse her until she fell asleep; if she was acting selfish, he’d accommodate her as much as possible, albeit reluctantly.</p>
<p>While she acknowledged that he wasn’t exceptionally good at academics or sports, he was, to her, the one and only brother she could ever be proud of.</p>
<p>Recently, however, she noticed a change in Hondō.</p>
<p>He started coming home late, and when asked why, he said he had joined a club.</p>

<p>“That’s why…lately I’ve noticed something about Onii-chan.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“Onii-chan seems to be having more fun than before…”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong with that?”</p>
<p>“It’s not good. If Onii-chan has such a happy place to stay, he won’t need me anymore.”</p>

<p>Hondō’s sister looked as if she was about to cry again.</p>

<p>“I got scared thinking he’d eventually start staying at school late like today and just neglect me… Before I knew it, I had come all the way to his high school.”</p>

<p>So that’s what it was.</p>
<p>Hondō probably never expected that his sister would feel so cornered.</p>
<p>Getting scolded by Hondō at a time like this must have made her panic, thinking he had finally abandoned her.</p>
<p>There are many things I would like to say, but if I were to sum it up in one sentence…</p>

<p>“You’re an idiot.”</p>
<p>“Ah…?”</p>
<p>“Hondō would never abandon you. Even if something more important came along, he would never leave you alone.”</p>
<p>“Wh-Why can you be so sure about that?”</p>

<p>Certainly, from Hondō’s sister’s perspective, I must be just another classmate.</p>
<p>The reason I can make such a claim is extremely simple.</p>

<p>“Because I’m always watching Hondō and listening to him.”</p>

<p>I can feel my face getting hot.</p>
<p>Just for now, I wish she wouldn’t look at me.</p>

<p>“There’s not a single day when your name doesn’t come up in conversations with him. You’re that important to him.”</p>
<p>“Onii-chan…”</p>

<p>Tears fell from Hondō’s sister’s eyes.</p>
<p>It seems her emotions had opened in relief.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>Shimizu’s POV</strong></p>

<p>“Come here.”</p>
<p>“But…”</p>
<p>“Just come here. You don’t want anyone to see that face right now, do you?”</p>

<p>Hesitant, Hondō’s sister presses her face against my abdomen.</p>

<p>“I won’t ask questions, so cry all you want.”</p>

<p>I gently stroke Hondō’s sister’s head.</p>
<p>When I was little and on the verge of crying, Ai used to do the same for me.</p>

<p>“Uu….uuu..”</p>

<p>For a few minutes, Hondō’s sister’s sobs were the only sound in this space where only the two of us existed.</p>

<p>“Um, there’s something I want to ask.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>On our way back to the Astronomy Club’s room, Hondō’s sister, who had been silent up to this point, suddenly spoke.</p>

<p>“I get that you’re always listening to Onii-chan, but why are you always watching him?”</p>
<p>“Uh, well… that’s…”</p>

<p>I blurted that out back then to lend credibility to my claim that Hondō always worries about his sister.</p>
<p>But I didn’t expect her to dig into it now…</p>

<p>“Ah, I get it!”</p>
<p>“Go ahead, say it.”</p>
<p>“You like Onii-chan, don’t you!”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>

<p>Energetically, and unlike someone who had been crying just moments ago, Hondō’s sister dealt a huge blow to my mentality.</p>

<p>“No way I could like someone like that!”</p>
<p>“Onii-chan isn’t ‘someone like that.'”</p>

<p>Even without looking at her face, I could tell from her voice that she was sulking.</p>
<p>I had a vague idea before, but this sister is quite the brocon.</p>

<p>“S-sorry, I didn’t mean it like that.”</p>
<p>“So, do you like Onii-chan?”</p>
<p>“…we’re here already.”</p>
<p>“Ah, you dodged the question.”</p>
<p>“Think what you will. Are you ready? I’m opening the door.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>I open the door to the clubroom.</p>
<p>Inside, the other four other Astronomy Club members are present.</p>

<p>“Teruno!”</p>
<p>“Onii-chan!”</p>

<p>Hondō and his sister closed the distance between them and hugged each other when the distance reached zero.</p>

<p>“Teruno, I’m sorry for getting angry.”</p>
<p>“It’s okay, it was my fault.”</p>

<p>Ai, Yousuke, and Seto looked on at the siblings with smiles on their faces.</p>

<p>“I’m glad she was found safe and sound.”</p>
<p>“Right, really glad.”</p>
<p>“I agree with Senpai.”</p>

<p>Hondō releases his sister and turns to face Ai and the others.</p>

<p>“Ai-san, Yousuke-san, Seto-san, and Shimizu-san, thank you for helping with the search for Teruno.”</p>

<p>Saying this, Hondō bowed deeply.</p>

<p>“No need to thank us. Me and Daiki-kun are close friends after all!”</p>
<p>“Yeah, helping a friend in need is natural.”</p>
<p>“I always owe Hondō-kun, so if I could be of any help, that’s all the better.”</p>

<p>For some reason, everyone’s gaze is directed at me as if expecting me to say something.</p>

<p>“…uh, I was just repaying the favor from when you helped me before.”</p>
<p>“You’re really not honest, are you, Kei? You could just say, ‘Hondō-kun, I’m glad I can help you!’ “</p>
<p>“Who would say something like that!”</p>
<p>“Um… Can I have a word?”</p>
<p>“Hm? What’s up, Teruno-chan?”</p>
<p>“I have something I want to say to Shimizu-san…”</p>
<p>“Go ahead, I’ll listen.”</p>

<p>What is she planning to talk about?</p>
<p>For a moment, the conversation from earlier flashes across my mind.</p>

<p>『So, do you like Onii-chan?』</p>

<p>I don’t think so, but if I’m asked that question in front of Hondō, I wouldn’t know what to do.</p>

<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>Just as I thought Hondō’s sister was looking my way, she quickly bowed her head.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for what I said earlier!”</p>
<p>“Hey, lift your head up. It’ll look like I made you bow.”</p>

<p>Hondō’s sister slowly lifts her head.</p>

<p>“Will you forgive me?”</p>
<p>“I wasn’t really mad in the first place.”</p>
<p>“Thank you!”</p>
<p>“And you don’t have to use polite language; it feels off.”</p>
<p>“Got it! Can I ask you one more thing?”</p>
<p>“As long as it’s not the question from the hallway earlier, go ahead.”</p>
<p>“What’s your first name, Shimizu-san?”</p>

<p>Come to think of it, I might not have told her yet.</p>

<p>“It’s Kei (圭), written with the character for ‘above (上),’ with an added ‘soil (土)’ character.”</p>
<p>“I see… Can I make one last request?”</p>
<p>“For your information, I’m not as kind as Hondō, but go ahead and ask.”</p>
<p>“Can I call you Kei Onee-chan?”</p>
<p>“Wha…”</p>

<p>‘Onee-chan’… ‘Onee-chan’… ‘Onee-chan’…</p>
<p>What a sweet ring it has.</p>
<p>Having been a younger sister for sixteen years, I’ve had a slight, just a slight yearning to be called with that.</p>

<p>“Fine, you can call me that if you want.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Kei Onee-chan!”</p>
<p>“What about me?”</p>
<p>“Um, Ai Auntie (obasan)?”</p>
<p>“Ughhh…”</p>
<p>“Ai, are you okay!?”</p>

<p>Caught off guard by the unexpected emotional blow, Ai almost collapses on the spot.</p>
<p>She manages to stagger to her feet after about ten seconds.</p>

<p>“That was a complete surprise blow… If it were anyone but me, this could’ve turned into a big trouble…”</p>
<p>“Teruno, you can call me Mio.”</p>
<p>“Mio-san?”</p>
<p>“That works for me.”</p>

<p>Perhaps afraid of also being called ‘Auntie,’ Seto made sure to establish what she should be called.</p>

<p>“Oh, that’s right. Kei Onee-chan, can you lend me your ear?”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I’m rooting for you, Kei Onee-chan.”</p>
<p>“Wha…”</p>

<p>Hondō’s sister… Teruno, perhaps having regained her composure, wore a mischievous grin.</p>
