<h2>Chapter 9: 6 Main Heroines, 5 Bouquets</h2>

<p>“Then, everyone, are you mentally prepared?”</p>

<p>I and the six bride candidates gathered at the rooftop resort pool of the Roppongi Sky Tower. It was the same venue where the drink party was held on the first day, but the tension now was completely different, in a whole different things from that day.</p>
<p>The reason was obvius and cruel.</p>
<p>One person among these six would return from studying abroad.</p>

<p>“We have five bouquets here. From now on, Shinichi-sama will present one to each of you.”</p>

<p>I stood next to the table with the five bouquets., facing six bride candidates on the opposite side.</p>

<p>“And those who cannot receive a bouquet until the end will have to withdraw from studying abroad.”</p>

<p>Though it was intentionally done, Juujo-san’s cold and emotionless rule explanation made everyone hold their breath.</p>

<p>“…Now then, Shinichi-sama, if you please.”</p>

<p>And from here on, it would be handed over to me.</p>
<p>Naturally, it was my role to utter the most cruel words.</p>
<p>I cleared my throat quietly.</p>

<p>“First of all, thank you for participating in the study abroad until today.”</p>

<p>I looked at them again, dressed up.</p>
<p>Serious expressions with furrowed brows. Lips tied with a bit of anxiety. Gentle smiles that seemed to accept everything.</p>
<p>In each expression on their faces, I realize what each of them has put into it until today. That’s why I have to face it with all my might.</p>
<p>At this point in time, words such as “Everyone is attractive, both those who were selected and those who were not selected” are useless.</p>

<p>“…I chose the five I wanted to talk to more, to spend time with.”</p>

<p>However, what I chose were not the ones to be eliminated, but the five to move forward with. That was the emphasis.</p>

<p>“Now, please let me call out their names.”</p>

<p>I closed my eyes once.</p>

<p>Then, I opened them.</p>

<p>“…Maon Hirakawa.”</p>
<p>“Yes…!”</p>
<p>Wide-eyed, Maon walked towards me.</p>
<p>“Can you accept this bouquet?”</p>
<p>“Of course, Onii-chan.”</p>

<p>Maon looked surprised, but within her expressionless face, there was a faint sense of relief, and she spoke to me in a voice only I could hear.</p>

<p>“The cheating thing really doesn’t matter, does it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>
<p>“Is that so… I’m glad. Thank you.”</p>

<p>Maon deeply bowed and returned to her original position.</p>
<p>The reason I chose Maon wasn’t because she “cheated,” but she was the first one I called to emphasize that I had chosen five to move forward, not one to be eliminated. I wanted everyone to recognize that I chose the five without considering the mysterious letter.</p>
<p>In the end, it could be considered as Maon’s strategic victory.</p>
<p>I took a deep breath once again.</p>
<p>The ones being called would be even more nervous, so if I, as the one calling, had irregular breathing, it wouldn’t look good.</p>
<p>Hesitation would be nothing but hypocrisy.</p>
<p>Alright.</p>
<p>I, with care and clarity, began calling out their names.</p>

<p>“Yu Shibuya.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Shin.”</p>

<p>Yu received it with fewer words than usual. She indeed had considerate sensitivity.</p>

<p>“Ria Meguro.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Shinichi-kun… It’s more nerve-wracking to be chosen by one person than by a hundred million.”</p>
<p>Even the composed Ria showed a troubled smile with a tired expression.</p>

<p>“Reona Kanda.”</p>
<p>“…Thank you, Hirakawa.”</p>
<p>“…Is the strategy a success?”</p>
<p>When I asked in a low voice, she shrugged and replied,</p>
<p>“Did you figure it out? You’re quite an actor.”</p>

<p>Her real reason for not wanting to be invited to the 1-on-1 date wasn’t a cute one like “to reduce Hirakawa’s regret,” but probably something like “Hirakawa won’t reject someone he meets for the first time, who he hasn’t gone on a date with.”</p>
<p>Although I chose to present the bouquet to her because I wanted to know a bit more about her inexhaustible personality, it ended up fitting into her strategy of abandoning the date.</p>

<p>“This strategy won’t work from now on.”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>Kanda bowed elegantly and returned to her original position.</p>
<p>…Now, from here, it would be the most difficult part for them—or rather, for her. It was finally the last bouquet.</p>
<p>The person not called here would return from studying abroad.</p>
<p>I called out the name of the person I hoped would go on to Season 2 with a heavy heart.</p>

<p>“Sakiho Shinagawa.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>
<p>“…!”</p>
<p>Simultaneously with Sakiho’s answer, there was a sound of gasping sharply, and I soothed my painful chest with a breath.</p>
<p>Damn. That’s why you shouldn’t form relationships more than necessary.</p>

<p>“…Can you accept this bouquet?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>

<p>Despite the opponent she should have hated being eliminated, Sakiho hesitated and finally spoke with a choked voice.</p>
<p>Even though she had been eliminated, there was no bouquet in her hands. Juujo-san, probably more indifferent in tone than me, delivered the final words.</p>

<p>“Sumire Osaki-sama will now withdraw from studying abroad. Would you like to have a final conversation with Shinichi-sama?”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>

<p>Osaki and I moved to the side of the pool.</p>

<p>“Why, couldn’t it work?”</p>

<p>Osaki, surely suppressing her emotions, said,</p>

<p>“I’m sure I could be more of help to you than anyone else. I’m ready to dedicate my entire life to living for you, supporting you, being with you.”</p>
<p>Even with a beautiful smile,</p>
<p>“Wasn’t that… not conveyed…?”</p>

<p>But with a slightly moist voice, she asked me such a thing.</p>

<p>“It’s because I got the message across, Osaki.”</p>
<p>“I got it, so…?”</p>

<p>Her face contorted at my answer.</p>

<p>“I don’t want anyone to find their purpose in life through me.”</p>
<p>“Why…?”</p>
<p>“The fact that there are people living for my sake becomes a shackle no matter what. I am not strong enough to cut off those who live for me.”</p>

<p>I gritted my teeth.</p>

<p>“…It’s not that you’re not strong. Shinichi-kun, you’re kind.”</p>
<p>“It’s not kindness. It’s just self-indulgence.”</p>

<p>The fear of being disliked by someone important creates cowardice and hesitation, while specific feelings towards someone generate jealousy and a sense of unfairness.</p>
<p>Both situations dull a person’s ability to make sound judgments in relationships.</p>

<p>“So, I can’t be with Osaki anymore.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>Osaki laughed as if breaking free.</p>

<p>“So, it’s going to be an engagement and marriage with an unseen fiancée. I wonder what kind of person they are. Maybe a greasy middle-aged man?”</p>
<p>“That’s a terrible taste…”</p>

<p>If you’re going to say that, then you should know I’m not strong either. So, at least, I decided to take some measures.</p>

<p>“Osaki, can I borrow that thing you’re wearing on your chest?”</p>
<p>“Well, there’s no point in keeping it a secret anymore.”</p>

<p>Osaki removed the listening device from her chest and handed it to me.</p>

<p>“Hey… Can you hear me, Osaki’s father?”</p>

<p>Speaking into the microphone of the received listening device, I addressed him.</p>

<p>“I am Shinichi Hirakawa. …I am the person who will become the CEO of Japan’s number one company.”</p>

<p>Oh well. I’ve boasted a lot. I’m diving deeper into a place I can’t turn back from. Not that I have any intention of turning back.</p>
