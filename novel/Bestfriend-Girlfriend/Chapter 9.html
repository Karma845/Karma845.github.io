<h1>Chapter 9: Revelation on the Beach</h1>

<p>“Shin, you get it, right?”</p>

<p>Her eyes sparkling brighter than the sun overhead. Popular YouTuber Shibuya Yu aimed her smartphone camera at me and laughed.</p>

<p>“The blue sky, white clouds, blue sea! Even though they haven’t arrived yet, the beautiful girls in swimsuits! No matter what you shoot, it’s the ultimate location for a picturesque scene!”</p>
<p>“Uh, yeah… I-I didn’t choose this place, though…”</p>

<p>I mumbled my response while trying not to stare at the healthy skin and assertive cleavage of the girl in a swimsuit bending over in front of me.</p>
<p>Yu and I were sitting on the edge of a canopy-covered bed (apparently called a cabana) on the sandy beach.</p>

<p>All Stars.</p>

<p>Today was the last “Group Date” of Season 1. The location was a private beach in Guam. The fact that this stretch of beach, extending for hundreds of meters, was reserved exclusively for us was surprising enough. Yet, there were cabanas, hammocks, a bar counter, tables, and even a ping pong table.</p>

<p>“I got an additional date on the first date, so since then, I’ve been taking shots of Roppongi landscapes, and the screen hasn’t changed much. I captured the daily lives of girls who haven’t been on dates, though.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, uh-huh…”</p>
<p>“Hey, why are you looking down all the time? Look this way, it’s been a while since you appeared on my channel!”</p>

<p>She suddenly lifted my chin and directed my gaze to her.</p>
<p>Holding her smartphone camera, Yu nodded in satisfaction, “Yeah, Shin’s swimsuit looks good too.” Her compliment, lacking any sarcasm, made me feel a bit happy.</p>

<p>“Come on, everyone, hurry up and come! It’s taking too long to change! You should just wear a swimsuit under your clothes like me since morning!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t that like something a grade schooler would do…”</p>

<p>Indeed, it might be more efficient that way, but it could be considered overly meticulous. Well, everyone is free to do as they please.</p>

<p>“Oh, look! Yu-chan and Shinichi are alone! Unfair!”</p>

<p>As we were having such a conversation, the former idol Meguro Ria, who provocatively puffed up her cheeks, arrived.</p>

<p>“Ria, you change so fast!”</p>
<p>“Of course! Although I can’t beat Yu-chan, who came all the way from Japan. I have confidence in changing costumes quickly because I’m an idol, you know?”</p>

<p>While saying such things, she firmly stuck to my right side, sat down, and embraced my right arm. Squish. The soft sensation that never became familiar, stimulating the nerves of my right arm, made it impossible for me to look in that direction again.</p>
<p>“Look here, Shinichi!”</p>
<p>“Well, I mean, come on, that’s enough.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Awkward, isn’t it? Maybe you reacted because it’s light clothing?”</p>

<p>If you understand, don’t add salt on the wound.</p>
<p>She was so much like the “ideal girlfriend” when she came out of the sauna, but why does she become like this in mischievous mode…!</p>
<p>When I looked to my left for help, Shibuya Yu, holding the camera, was looking at me with a somewhat cold gaze. What’s with that?</p>

<p>“Hey, Shinichi. If you don’t look here, I’ll kiss your cheek, okay?”</p>
<p>“Stop that…”</p>

<p>Even though it’s the cheek, a kiss is still a kiss. Unexpected ones are one thing, but I can’t give permission when I know it’s coming.</p>

<p>“Then look here, okay? 10, 9, 8…”</p>

<p>Ria started a countdown. It seemed like if I didn’t turn in her direction before it reached zero, she would kiss my cheek.</p>

<p>“5… 4… 3… -”</p>

<p>Staring at Ria is much better than being kissed. Well, I have no choice but to turn in that direction obediently.</p>

<p>“I understand…!?”</p>
<p>“…Hmm.”</p>
<p>“Hmm?”</p>

<p>I opened my eyes wide.</p>

<p>At an extremely close distance where the focus didn’t match, there was fine skin and silky hair.</p>
<p>Could this possibly be…!</p>
<p>Just as my brain finally tried to understand the situation,</p>

<p>“Haaaaaa!”</p>

<p>From a slightly distant direction, the ridiculously loud voices of two girls could be heard.</p>

<p>“The worst, the worst, the worst, the worst, the worst, the worst, the worst, the worst…!”</p>
<p>On the right, childhood friend Shinagawa Sakoho muttered,</p>
<p>“The worst, the worst, the worst, the worst, the worst, the worst, the worst, the worst…!”</p>
<p>On the left, ex-girlfriend Osaki Sumire grumbled resentfully in stereo. Just a while ago, I accidentally kissed Meguro Ria on the cheek.</p>

<p>It would be more accurate to say that Ria’s cheek was where I looked, but that wouldn’t be apparent from a distance. Sakiho and Osaki, who had just finished changing and were heading towards us, witnessed the scene.</p>
<p>By the way, Ria said to Sakiho and Osaki,</p>

<p>“It’s not like Shinichi’s lips belong to Sumire-chan or Sakiho-chan, right? If you say that, then what about Reona-chan…”</p>

<p>Probably attempting to expose some misdeeds in the sauna,</p>

<p>“Be Quiet, Meguro.”</p>

<p>Kanda, who had just arrived, covered her mouth and take her away.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Maon, who came later, saying</p>

<p>“Uwaa… its strange. What happened in this atmosphere…?”</p>

<p>also was taken away by Yu, who seemed somehow displeased.</p>

<p>“Maon-chan, I’ll show you the whole story later.”</p>

<p>And so, the three of us were left. The situation with my ex-girlfriend and childhood friend was too chaotic.</p>

<p>“Hey, Shinichi. The kiss you gave to someone, that was your first, right? I told you to cherish your first kiss, Shinichi.”</p>
<p>“I thought Hirakawa-kun was dirty isn’t he?. I thought he had a modest sense of pride not to kiss before marriage, even when we were dating.”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t initiate it…”</p>
<p>“Did Shinichi initiate it?”</p>
<p>“Did Hirakawa-kun initiate it?”</p>

<p>Both of them made similar retorts. The two of them are surprisingly in sync today…</p>

<p>“It’s a misunderstanding… Yu was probably recording the whole thing, so if we check later…”</p>
<p>“That’s like torture…”</p>

<p>Once again, tears could be heard in stereo.</p>
<p>At that moment, a voice of relief (?) could be heard.</p>

<p>“We apologize for the wait. Everyone, please gather.”</p>

<p>Jujoo-san clapped her hands to attract attention.</p>

<p>“I will announce the ‘Challenge Task’ for the final date.”</p>
<p>“…Challenge Task?”</p>

<p>In a pavilion-like structure within the private beach.</p>

<p>“We didn’t say there would be no challenge for the final group date, right?”</p>
<p>“Not at all! This surprise is fantastic! Our bodies were getting stiff!”</p>

<p>When Kanda asked Jujoo-san, Yuu started doing something like warm-up exercises beside her.</p>

<p>“Suddenly, Shinichi-sama wanted another chance for an additional date.”</p>
<p>“Is that so, Shinichi?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah.”</p>

<p>Apart from the date, there was still something unresolved.</p>

<p>“Now, what’s the task!? Tell us, Jujoo-san!”</p>

<p>Yuu aimed her camera at Jujoo-san.</p>

<p>“The final challenge task is the ‘Shinichi-sama Quiz.'”</p>
<p>“Shinichi-sama Quiz…?”</p>

<p>Kanda and Osaki frowned.</p>
<p>Yeah, I naturally had thoughts about that naming. However, Jujoo-san’s insistence, “Simple is best, Shinichi-sama,” was strong…</p>

<p>“From now on, guess Shinichi-sama’s ‘favorite color,’ ‘favorite number,’ ‘favorite alphabet,’ and ‘favorite animal,’ and write them on this paper. By the way, we have already received the correct answers from Shinichi-sama in advance through an internal phone call.”</p>
<p>“That’s too ea-!”</p>
<p>“Kantamugu? Shinagawa-san, is something wrong?” (tl note : 「かんたむぐ」)</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>Sakiho probably started to say, “That’s too easy!” and covered her own mouth.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Isn’t Sakiho-chan too advantageous?”</p>

<p>But, despite any resistance, Ria threw the question. Well, one would think so.</p>

<p>“If you say that, then I want Shinichi’s kiss from earlier returned, right? Can I wipe your cheek?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, Sakiho-chan’s eyes are serious, Shinichi-kun…”</p>

<p>Even if you tell me…</p>

<p>“But, is there any meaning in doing this in Guam?”</p>

<p>Kanda still had a puzzled expression. As if implying that having an additional date would be troublesome.</p>

<p>“It’s an impromptu game, so please bear with us. Also, for the additional date, it will be on a chartered submarine, unique to Guam.”</p>
<p>“A submarine! I’ve always wanted to ride one! Fantastic!”</p>
<p>“Now, everyone, please submit your answers.”</p>

<p>Jujoo-san handed out five sheets of paper.</p>
<p>Among the questions, she alone stared at us without saying a word, with a serious expression.</p>
<p>Five minutes later.</p>
<p>Jujoo-san looked at the answer sheets for everyone, marking them with circles.</p>

<p>“Now that all the answers are in… There is someone who got all the questions correct.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Who could it be?”</p>
<p>“See, I told you it’s unfair…”</p>

<p>With a confident expression, Sakiho puffed up her chest, and Ria frowned.</p>

<p>“That person is…”</p>

<p>However, the name Jujoo-san announced was not Sakiho’s.</p>

<p>“It is Hirakawa Maon-sama.”</p>
<p>“Is this a joke…!?”</p>

<p>Sakiho widened her eyes.</p>

<p>“Wait a minute!? I’m absolutely sure I got all the questions right, didn’t I? ‘My favorite color is’ black, ‘my favorite number is’ 1, ‘my favorite alphabet is’ A, and ‘my favorite animal is’ a lion, right?”</p>
<p>“No, the ‘correct answers this time’ are: favorite color is white, favorite number is 3, favorite alphabet is S, and favorite animal is a giraffe.”</p>
<p>“Huh… Shinichi, what’s going on!? When did it change!?”</p>
<p>“Well, it hasn’t changed…”</p>
<p>“What does that mean?”</p>

<p>While Osaki frowned, Maon bit her lower lip.</p>

<p>“It’s clear now. The person behind the mysterious notes placed on the living room table at Sky Tower is…”</p>
<p>“I thought it was too obvious for a trap…”</p>

<p>I looked directly at the ‘culprit’ and slowly revealed.</p>

<p>“The ‘mastermind behind the mysterious notes’ is Maon, right?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“And the person mentioned in the mysterious notes as ‘someone cheating’ is probably everyone here.”</p>
<p>“Shinichi, what do you mean?”</p>

<p>As Osaki frowned, Maon, biting her lower lip, remained silent.</p>

<p>“With this, it’s clear. Maon is involved in the construction of the internal network. In other words, it was easy for her to see exchanges on the internal network. Even the internal phone call exchanges. So, Maon knew the destinations and contents of the first two group dates. She conveyed that to everyone, saying, ‘It’s a secret from others.’ The condition of the deal was probably… ‘Cooperate with Maon once.'”</p>

<p>“Eh, so everyone knew…!?”</p>

<p>Looking at Ria, who returned a shocked expression after the revelation, Maon nodded.</p>

<p>“Suprise… Shinichi-kun, how did you figure it out?”</p>
<p>“Well, it’s simple. In the Disney Triple Date, all three of you were too well-prepared.”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>
<p>“Ahaha, that’s true.”</p>

<p>The three celebrities raised their voices.</p>

<p>“Firstly, Yuu. You brought chopstick lottery sticks, right? Three sticks, carefully made. And that, you tampered with them to ensure you would be the first, right? Making sticks with ‘2, 2, 3’ or ‘2, 3, 3,’ having the other two draw first, and saying, ‘The remaining number is 1, so I’m the first.'”</p>
<p>“I absolutely wanted to win! It was a thorough strategy!”</p>

<p>Yu proudly declared. I wondered if this was her idea of a cool way of life. However, it seemed unnecessary to worry about that. If she was satisfied, that was fine.</p>

<p>“And Kanda prepared a tracksuit, and Ria prepared a place that only Ria knows.”</p>
<p>“Got caught, huh? Haha.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, thought I did well…”</p>

<p>Both of them admitted it.</p>

<p>“And then, during the date in Nasu, Maon also told the same details to two people, namely Sakiho and Osaki.”</p>
<p>“Wow, Osaki Sumire knew about it too…”</p>
<p>“And Shinagawa-san knew too…”</p>
<p>“Over here, the preparation is too good. Herb tea, miso, and all that…”</p>

<p>Both of them slumped down.</p>

<p>“And as part of the deal, Sakiho and Osaki were provoked with psychological tactics during the rock-paper-scissors at the supermarket. Something like ‘Maon, I absolutely want to win here. Maon will choose paper,’ was used. Also, with Kanda and Ria, I arranged for them to meet me when I go to the sauna. Maybe everyone thought, ‘Is that really okay?'”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>Maon nodded, biting her lower lip. Osaki raised her hand beside her and said, “Can I ask something?”</p>

<p>“Even though we had a deal… What was Maon-san’s purpose in doing all this?”</p>
<p>“For the 1on1 date, or to be more specific, for the very last 1on1 date.”</p>

<p>Maon herself answered that question.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Manzai Grand Prix, Figure Skating… For competitions that involve scoring with a certain level of subjectivity, it is considered advantageous to perform later in the lineup. Furthermore, I believe that 1-on-1 dates are not only longer in duration than additional group dates but also more intense in experience. Actually, it was quite intense, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it was…”</p>

<p>Sakiho and Osaki nodded somewhat embarrassedly. It seemed like there was something intense that happened…</p>

<p>“Normally, those who get to go on 1-on-1 dates are supposed to be people who didn’t talk much during the group date. So, for everyone except Maon, I wanted you to talk a lot with Onii-chan during the group date.”</p>

<p>“To achieve that, did you pass information to Rii and the others?”</p>

<p>“Yes. Additionally, in the world of showbiz, I informed Ria-san alone that happy hormones are secreted through skinship. Therefore, by having her confine you, I wanted Ria-san to have a lot of conversations. If someone other than Ria-san won and went on an additional date, the candidates for 1-on-1 dates would decrease.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I fell for it completely…”</p>

<p>Ria chuckled and casually tapped her own forehead.</p>

<p>“In the Nasu date, I used the terms of the deal to get the timing for Onii-chan and me to be alone just once. That’s when Maon laid the groundwork for inviting Onii-chan to a 1-on-1 date.”</p>
<p>“Groundwork?”</p>
<p>“…That’s a secret.”</p>

<p>It’s probably referring to the line, ‘There’s something I want to talk about when we’re alone.’ In fact, because of that line, I struggled with whether to choose Osaki or Maon for the final 1-on-1.</p>

<p>“And I also created a decisive mysterious letter. For those who went on additional dates, Yu-san and Sumire-san, I left them alone. But for Reona-san and Ria-san, I had them meet Onii-chan in the sauna to create an alibi. Onii-chan entering the sauna exactly two hours after dinner was clearly recorded in the men’s bath entrance and exit records.”</p>
<p>“What about me?”</p>
<p>“Sakiho-san, you automatically create an alibi even if Maon does nothing.”</p>
<p>“Ah, that’s true. I was sneaking into Shinichi’s room at that time.”</p>
<p>“You should be a little more remorseful…”</p>

<p>Sakiho agreed, and Osaki looked astonished.</p>

<p>“With Onii-chan’s reasoning ability, it would be obvious that Maon was behind the mysterious letter. But the person who cheated couldn’t be determined. Because the one who cheated the most was Maon, and at that point, Maon hadn’t received the benefits of cheating. Therefore, Onii-chan thought that by inviting Maon, he could find out who was cheating. …That’s where the miscalculation occurred for the first time.”</p>
<p>“So, it means that the person who went on an additional date invited me for the final 1-on-1 date…”</p>

<p>Maon looked at me intently.</p>

<p>“Why did Onii-chan choose Sakiho-san and Sumire-san instead of Maon?”</p>

<p>I stared back and conveyed clearly.</p>

<p>“When Sakiho’s alibi was confirmed, I understood that it was Maon’s strategy. That was enough for me.”</p>
<p>“…Enough?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. I learned that Maon was serious about this exchange study, not some sister who needed protection, but an independent person. …Maon, who was so bad at talking to strangers, negotiated with others. That was enough for me.”</p>

<p>I smiled at the growth of my sister, who had been mostly a shut-in.</p>

<p>“So, at that time, I decided to have a 1-on-1 date with Osaki as soon as possible.”</p>
<p>“Is that so…”</p>
<p>“Besides, I don’t think any part of this strategy is cheating.”</p>

<p>I assert. This is an important point.</p>

<p>“No one is at fault. This is just a deal. So, I want to make it clear that there is no negative impact on the Season 1 Flower Ceremony.”</p>

<p>The tension that had been flowing among the six people relaxed slightly.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Onii-chan!”</p>

<p>Even so, I spoke to Maon, who bowed her head again.</p>

<p>“In that case, shall we go, Maon?”</p>

<p>Maon raised her voice in a somewhat disordered manner.</p>

<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“Incomprehensible . Where are we going?” (Fukakai desu)</p>
<p>“It’s obvious, isn’t it? It’s already decided for an additional date. I am a man of my word.”</p>
<p>“But wasn’t that a strategy to expose Maon’s cheating…?”</p>

<p>With widened eyes, Maon tilted her head.</p>

<p>“Including this, didn’t Maon win in terms of strategy?”</p>
<p>“…Onii-chan is too kind.”</p>

<p>Finally, Maon smiled.</p>

<p>“Wow… its really beautiful, Onii-chan.”</p>

<p>Maon, looking at the fish outside the submarine window, let out a small cheer.</p>

<p>“Yes, …it is. Hey, Maon, are you sure about that? Is that thing any good?”</p>
<p>“Incomprehensible. What do you mean?”</p>

<p>I lowered my voice a little and spoke to her secretly.</p>

<p>“The thing about wanting to talk when we’re alone. Was that really true?”</p>

<p>The logic about the Manzai Grand Prix was probably just a makeshift lie. It’s hard to believe that Maon would reject an additional date for such a dubious advantage. In other words, Maon really wanted to talk when we were alone, and for that, she needed to bring it to a 1-on-1 date.</p>

<p>“Onii-chan.”</p>

<p>Maon seemed a little flustered and brought her lips close to my ear.</p>

<p>“It’s something that really, really has to be done when we’re truly alone.”</p>

<p>She looked at me earnestly with her sapphire eyes as she moved away from me.</p>
