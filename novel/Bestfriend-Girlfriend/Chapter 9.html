<h2>Chapter 9: Lies</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>The next morning, I woke up earlier than usual and waited in front of the Yukinami residence. In one hand, I held a paper bag containing the souvenir I failed to give yesterday. Even if she would complain, this was my excuse to meet her.</p>



<p>As I simulated the upcoming scenarios in my mind, suddenly, the door of the Yukinami house opened. To my surprise, it wasn’t Sayu but her mother, who was the spitting image of her.</p>



<p>“Oh, Kisumi-kun? How have you been?!”</p>



<p>Sayu’s mother, who had come out to take out the trash, noticed me and swiftly approached in her sandals.</p>



<p>“Long time no see. Oh, it’s trash day, right? I’ll help you.”</p>



<p>“Oh, don’t worry about it.”</p>



<p>“Please let me.” I took the trash bag and carried it to a nearby utility pole.</p>



<p>“It’s been years since Kisumi-kun helped me like this. I’m glad to see you again! You’ve grown quite tall. Boys really do undergo such a growth spurt, don’t they? Maybe I should give Sayu’s little brother now. Ah, of course, I’m joking ~”</p>



<p>Sayu’s mom always treated me like a friend. She didn’t seem like a typical mother of a high school girl. Her youthful appearance could easily prompt someone to mistake them for sisters when they strolled through town together. Being quite chatty, we used to have morning conversations like this while waiting for Sayu to get ready.</p>



<p>“What brings you here today? Could it be you came to see me? That’d make my day!”</p>



<p>“Good morning. I’m happy to see you too. Oh, by the way, here’s a souvenir from our family trip the other day. Please take it.” I handed the souvenir to Sayu’s mom.</p>



<p>“Thank you! Ah, hot spring manju! This will be perfect for today’s snack.”</p>



<p>“Where’s Sayu?”</p>



<p>“Oh, Sayu-chan left the house unusually early this morning.”</p>



<p>“Already off to school? Why?”</p>



<p>“Who knows?”</p>



<p>“Did she become an early riser now? I remember she used to oversleep so much.”</p>



<p>“Oh, that’s not true at all. Sayu-chan has been good at waking up since she was little.” Sayu’s mom casually dropped something that couldn’t be ignored.</p>



<p>“Huh? What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“──Oh, I shouldn’t have said that to you. It was something Sayu-chan told me not to mention. But, well, it’s the past now. I’m sorry for keeping it a secret.”</p>



<p>Sayu’s mom admitted with an innocent grin. <em>Sayu is good at waking up early?</em></p>



<p>“Well, then. If Sayu can wake up in the morning, does that mean…?” I hesitantly inquired.</p>



<p>“That girl has always been an early riser since forever. She always wakes up with plenty of time every morning and she simply didn’t want to go to morning practice. But when you started picking her up, she reluctantly went and gradually enjoyed it. So when you stopped coming to pick her up, it seemed to be a big blow to her.”</p>



<p>“…I see.”</p>



<p>“She was looking forward to your support too during her retirement match. But, if you couldn’t make it, it can’t be helped.”</p>



<p>“……”</p>



<p>“Oh, right. That’s why I was surprised when she suddenly said she wanted to go to Eisei High. Sayu-chan worked hard despite not being good at studying. That’s also thanks to you, Kisumi-kun.” Sayu’s mom narrowed her eyes and smiled.</p>



<p>“I didn’t do anything. Sayu achieved everything through her own efforts.”</p>



<p>“Even so, you were the one who gave her that push. Thank you.” Sayu’s mom seemed to know everything. At least, that’s how I felt.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, did you get a girlfriend in high school?”</p>



<p>“Yes.”</p>



<p>“Is she prettier than my daughter?”</p>



<p>“The girl I fell for is the most beautiful in the world.”</p>



<p>“Hehehe, a perfect answer out of a hundred.”</p>



<p>“I’m sorry.”</p>



<p>“It’s fine. That child is living a wonderful youth. It’ll surely become a wonderful memory.”</p>



<p>I left the Yukinami residence and headed straight to school, walking alone through the deserted residential area. There was still plenty of time before classes started, but my pace quickened, frustration mingling with each step.</p>



<p>“Playing with my feelings like that…” I unintentionally muttered my discontent.</p>



<p>“Then confessing only to run away.” Before I knew it, I was already running.</p>



<p>“What’s with the fake confession? What’s this nonsense about being bad at waking up at the morning? Honestly, it’s all a bunch of lies!”</p>



<p>The girl I thought was Yukinami Sayu turned out to be someone entirely different.</p>



<p>“If you’re going to lie, at least stick with it! You know it’s too late!” I tried to outrun my anger with every desperate step.</p>



<p>“You confessed while knowing you’re going to get rejected, then postponing it again!”</p>



<p>No one was originally at fault. Back then, I was dense, and Sayu was a liar. And if you traced those lies back, they were merely attempts to cover up embarrassment.</p>



<p>The casual relationship between upperclassman and underclassman, like easygoing friends, seemed so ordinary that the idea of anything beyond that never crossed my mind.</p>



<p>After retiring from the club, I focused on exam preparations and had no room for thoughts of romance. Then, I entered Eisei High and fell in love with Arisaka Yorka.</p>



<p>Ironically, every time me and Sayu missed out each other, Sayu would regain her original motivation. Because I didn’t show up for her retirement match, she was determined to meet me and managed to pass the entrance exam for Eisei High.</p>



<p>But by the time she caught up, I was already dating Yorka.</p>



<p>When I reached school, I sent a message to Sayu.</p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>Where are you now?</em></p>



<p><strong>Sayu</strong>: <em>Still in bed. So tired.</em></p>



<p>I knew she wasn’t at home. Yet, her lie meant her mom hadn’t contacted her. I decided to play along with her lie.</p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>How can you be so bad in the morning? You sleep too much.</em></p>



<p><strong>Sayu</strong>: <em>What can I do? If Ki-senpai comes to pick me up, I might wake up early.</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>Alright, I’ll make an exception today.</em></p>



<p><strong>Sayu</strong>: <em>Are you excited to see Sayu-chan’s morning face, senpai? You’re a pervert ~</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>Who’s the pervert?</em></p>



<p><strong>Sayu</strong>: <em>Sure, sure. Well, I’m off to breakfast then!</em></p>



<p>And just like that, the conversation was abruptly cut off. However──</p>



<p>“What breakfast? You’re up surprisingly early today, Sayu.”</p>



<p>“Huh… Why are you here?” Surprised by my sudden appearance in her first-year classroom, Sayu was completely frozen. While messaging, I changed into indoor shoes and rushed up to the first-year classrooms.</p>



<p>“Let’s talk. This time, only the absolute truth.”</p>



<p>Lies wouldn’t work anymore.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>Since anyone could come into the classroom at any moment, we moved to the rooftop. The empty rooftop provided a clear view, and the voices of the soccer team practicing on the grounds below reached us. I took in a deep breath of the refreshing morning air.</p>



<p>The May sky was beautifully blue.</p>



<p>“Why are you already at school?”</p>



<p>“I dropped by your house earlier. Your mom told me a few things.”</p>



<p>“Ugh, Mom!”</p>



<p>“I asked on my own. Don’t blame her.”</p>



<p>“Coming to school this early to see me—Just how much do you like me?”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I like you, Sayu.”</p>



<p>“Eh!?” Sayu let out a surprised, bizarre sound.</p>



<p>“W-why are you suddenly saying that? What kind of scheme is this?”</p>



<p>“After what happened at the park, I thought about it a lot. What kind of girl was Yukinami Sayu to me.”</p>



<p>“Sounds like quite an impact.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, the most memorable one so far. And I’ve figured it out.”</p>



<p>“Alright.”</p>



<p>“We used to spend a lot of time together, right? Not just because I was a senpai and you were my kouhai, but because we genuinely got along.”</p>



<p>“I feel the same way.”</p>



<p>“If you had gotten a boyfriend back in middle school, I think I would’ve been pretty lonely during those times. That’s how much I enjoyed the time we spent together.” Those innocent, carefree days. I spoke my true feelings.</p>



<p>“Y-You’ve finally become honest.” Sayu’s cheeks seemed to be loosening, as if she were barely holding back a smile.</p>



<p>“Actually, in middle school, you were the girl I talked to the most.”</p>



<p>Definitely more than my female classmates, we exchanged a lot of words.</p>



<p>“There wasn’t any other girl who would indulge you like I did.”</p>



<p>“That’s true,” I honestly admitted.</p>



<p>“U-um, senpai. Just, wait a second. If you’re too straightforward, it’s kind of unexpected, so, um…”</p>



<p>The more I spoke, the redder Sayu’s face became.</p>



<p>“Why are you panicking now? If you don’t like it, I can give you the answer right now.”</p>



<p>“U-um, there’s no need to hurry. Can we do this another time?” When Sayu tried to escape, I grabbed her wrist.</p>



<p>“Geez, you’re quite forceful. I said I’d wait for your answer.” Sayu kept a calm tone while twisting her body to shake off my hand.</p>



<p>“Enough with the lies. Don’t make excuse either.”</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai, let go!”</p>



<p>“Sayu.”</p>



<p>“I don’t want to hear it!”</p>



<p>“Even so, the one I want to cherish the most is Yorka. That’s why I can’t reciprocate your feelings.” </p>



<p>Sayu, desperately trying to break free, suddenly stopped struggling and went quiet. With her face turned away and her hair in disarray, I couldn’t discern the expression on her face.</p>



<p>“This is my answer.” I said it.</p>



<p>I laid bare my honest feelings without any disguise. To put a clear end to our middle school days, whatever consequences it might bring. I couldn’t postpone the answer any longer.</p>



<p>“You’re head over heels, I get it! Yor-senpai is beautiful! You must be over the moon right now! But no matter how you look at it, you and Yor-senpai are just not a match! You’ll break up eventually!”</p>



<p>“If I started thinking about breaking up, I’d never fall for anyone in the first place.”</p>



<p>“But she’s way out of your league!”</p>



<p>“It’s precisely because of that reason that I can see the potential. She likes me despite a mismatch.”</p>



<p>“I’ll say it as many times as need! Being ordinary is just fine. Setting your sights too high only hurts yourself!”</p>



<p>Even amidst the harsh words, I maintained my composure.</p>



<p>“Sayu, you’re special too. It made me happy when such a cute girl confessed to me.”</p>



<p>“Now of all times, I don’t need flattery! If you really thought I was cute, you should’ve confessed in middle school!”</p>



<p>“…..”</p>



<p>“Senpai, do you understand? You’re strangling yourself.”</p>



<p>“What do you mean?”</p>



<p>“As the class representative, you’re good at interacting and adjusting to others. That’s why Yor-senpai started dating you. But once she gets used talking to others naturally, she won’t need ordinary Ki-senpai anymore, right? You’re raising the possibility of being thrown away… it’s foolish.”</p>



<p>If Yorka had acquired communication skills as Sayu imagined, she would indeed be invincible. The perfect version of Yorka, with no apparent flaws.</p>



<p>“A beauty like Yor-senpai can pick anyone she wants. Someone even more amazing, kinder, cooler could come and sweep her off her feet…”</p>



<p>“The future is uncertain. Did you think I would end up having a girlfriend when I entered high school?”</p>



<p>“That’s not fair, you’re always going ahead of me,” Sayu muttered in a low voice.</p>



<p>“For you, Arisaka Yorka might seem like the perfect girl. But the Yorka I know is different. She’s indecisive, unreliable, and that’s why I want to be there for her.”</p>



<p>“And so, you take care of her like you always do and end up falling for her, right? What’s different from my case? Why did you only confess to Yor-senpai!”</p>



<p>“Sayu, I…”</p>



<p>“…That’s enough. I understand your feelings. Let go, I’ll be fine.” Sayu slowly raised her head and faced me.</p>



<p>“A handkerchief. It hasn’t been used yet so it’s clean.” I gently released my grip and offered my handkerchief to the tearful Sayu.</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai is well-prepared too,” she muttered softly before knocking the handkerchief away. Despite her apparent anger, her voice remained cold.</p>



<p>“Sayu.”</p>



<p>“Hey, Ki-senpai. Wasn’t there a rumor that Yor-senpai had spent a night out?”</p>



<p>“What about it?”</p>



<p>“When that rumor spread all over the school, how did you honestly feel?”</p>



<p>“Naturally, it pissed me off as her boyfriend. Anyone would feel uncomfortable having such baseless rumors circulating.”</p>



<p>“But you know, where there’s smoke, there’s fire, right?”</p>



<p>“Don’t take the rumor seriously. They must be mistaken,” I answered according to Kanzaki-sensei’s statement.</p>



<p>“That’s a blatant lie.” Sayu’s voice carried conviction.</p>



<p>“Why do you think that?”</p>



<p>“—Because the one who spread that rumor was me.” Sayu had a wicked, twisted smile on her lips.</p>



<p>“Don’t tell such pointless lies now.”</p>



<p>I had no intention of dignifying this with a proper response.</p>



<p>“I won’t tell such troublesome lies anymore.” Her voice, dripping with provocation, mixed with mockery and anger. Then, like the lead actor confessing to the crime in a third-rate drama, Sayu began;</p>



<p>“On that Saturday morning, I happened to spot you two holding hands while walking in the neighborhood. I thought it couldn’t be true, so I secretly followed you and kept watching until you parted ways at the station. Seeing the usually detestable Arisaka Yorka holding hands with a guy was shocking enough, but finding out it was Ki-senpai… I thought I might die from the shock.” She used a contrived, deliberately dim-witted way of speaking.</p>



<p>“And what happened after that?”</p>



<p>“Did you ever hear ‘<em>the greatest hate springs from the greatest love?</em>‘ It was just about the time I planned to show up at the tea ceremony club. Before I knew it, I had already told many people about the matter. Jealousy is scary.”</p>



<p>“That’s why you decided to confront me.”</p>



<p>Right after being freed from Kanzaki-sensei’s scolding, Sayu conveniently appeared. It wasn’t a coincidence. The reunion was an inevitability orchestrated entirely by her.</p>



<p>“That’s right! I thought the rumor would lead to Yor-senpai breaking up with you. Then, in the dramatic reunion with the heartbroken Ki-senpai, a confession would follow. Finally, after years of unrequited love, I’d have a happy ending! That was the idea.” Even as she spoke with theatrical gestures, she seemed to lose steam before lowering both arms as if exhausted. </p>



<p>“I never expected you to announce your relationship. You outplayed me quite well, senpai. It’s amazing.” Her tone almost suggested like she wanted to blame herself.</p>



<p>“That nasty attitude doesn’t suit you, Sayu.”</p>



<p>“You must be disillusioned, huh? Now that you’ve uncovered the culprit behind the rumor, what’s your move?” Sayu challenged with a provocative smirk.</p>



<p>“There’s still a possibility you’re lying.”</p>



<p>“You’re quite the softie, senpai. Well, that’s what I liked about you.”</p>



<p>“I make sure not to take your words at face value.”</p>



<p>“But it’s true.”</p>



<p>“There’s no evidence that you’re the culprit!” I raised my voice, unwilling to believe.</p>



<p>“…There’s evidence. If you ask the advisor of the tea ceremony club, Kanzaki-sensei, she’ll surely know.”</p>



<p>“Kanzaki-sensei?” Suddenly, my homeroom teacher’s name came up, and for a moment, I couldn’t comprehend it.</p>



<p>“Verify it for yourself. You’re a coward who can’t even get angry.” Leaving those mocking words behind, Sayu moved to leave the rooftop.</p>



<p>“Sayu! Why did you bother confessing?”</p>



<p>“…If my unrequited love can never be fulfilled, I want to be hated enough not to be forgotten. I want to leave this mark in your heart as a scar. That’s all.” In Sayu’s profile as she turned, there was none of the liveliness I knew. Her indifferent gaze at me seemed hollow.</p>



<p>This was the end. She decided on that and executed it.</p>



<p>A confession to experience heartbreak. A confession meant to hurt. A confession intended to be unforgettable.</p>



<p>We couldn’t go back to the past.</p>



<p>The door to the rooftop closed, and I was left standing alone.</p>



<p>“That’s really harsh…” I leaned against the rooftop fence.</p>



<p>The final twist in this unfamiliar and difficult path after rejecting a confession. Not only was the bond severed, but the reveal also tainted the happy memories we had shared. No matter how much I tried to inhale the refreshing morning air, it didn’t work.</p>



<p><em>If there’s a way to clear this lump in my chest, someone, please, tell me.</em></p>



<p>With emotions spiraling aimlessly, I gripped the fence tightly.</p>



<p>Suddenly, I recalled the message I received from Yorka last night. I took out my phone to check it.</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>The flight got delayed due to bad weather, so I won’t make it to school tomorrow.</em></p>



<p>“This has to be a joke…”</p>



<p>The shock was so overwhelming that I couldn’t even muster a reply. Just as Golden Week ended, I thought I could finally meet Yorka, but she was still on the plane.</p>



<p>Dealing with this unexpected blow, all strength drained from my body.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>“Attention! Stand up! Bow! Sit!”</p>



<p>“…Sena-san, why are you so energetic this morning?” During the morning homeroom, I gave a surprisingly loud command and left Kanzaki-sensei suspicious.</p>



<p>“Nothing! There’s absolutely nothing!”</p>



<p>Though the teacher gave me a puzzled look, she didn’t delve further.</p>



<p>After brief announcements and a few words about the post-holiday period, the teacher concluded homeroom more succinctly than usual.</p>



<p>Having exhausted my energy and stamina with the exchange with Sayu on the rooftop, I resolved to get through this day by forcibly boosting my spirits.</p>



<p>“Sumisumi, you seem a bit off today.”</p>



<p>“Did you get dumped by Arisaka-chan during the break? Seems like she’s absent today.” Before the first class began, Miyachi and Nanamura gathered around my desk.</p>



<p>“Yorka’s flight is just delayed! I didn’t get dumped! Cut it out!”</p>



<p>“…Haha, as expected from her boyfriend. You’ve got it all under control.” Nanamura whistled casually, like a character from a Hollywood movie.</p>



<p>“Obviously.”</p>



<p>“But it must be sucks not being able to see your girlfriend after a long break.”</p>



<p>“Don’t praise me and then hurt me at the same time!” I punched Nanamura’s stomach, and as I thought, it was as hard as steel, making my hand hurt more.</p>



<p>“But, you need to get back to normal by tomorrow; otherwise, Yoryor will worry.” Miyachi looked at me with concern but didn’t pry into details. I appreciated her thoughtfulness.</p>



<p>“I know.”</p>



<p>“I heard that answer, so you better make sure you get yourself together!”</p>



<p>“Miyauchi sure has a soft spot for Sena. Let’s dig deeper and tease him more.”</p>



<p>“No! Even if it’s a joke, now is not the time for that.”</p>



<p>“Are you a psychic or something? Wait, what’s going on? Is it that bad?”</p>



<p>Even Nanamura dropped his playful tone and peered at me. While I could turn to them for help, my affair with Sayu was already over. I didn’t want to burden them with my pathetic sentiments.</p>



<p>“Thanks, but I’ll manage.”</p>



<p>When the bell rang, Miyachi and Nanamura returned to their seats. Until lunch break arrived, I looked back on the bitter ending between me and Yukinami Sayu.</p>



<p>In hindsight, it was a lousy situation. It was selfish of me to be surprised at being betrayed when I failed to support Sayu in the first place. Sayu concealed her feelings for years while interacting with me. The fact that I misinterpreted the true feelings of someone close to me was profoundly shocking.</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s my fault after all.”</p>



<p>If I had properly gone to cheer Sayu at her retirement match last summer, she wouldn’t have ended up so heartbroken. At the very least, if I had replied, I wouldn’t have pushed her this far.</p>



<p>“Really, leaving things on ‘read’ isn’t good.”</p>



<p>Leaving messages without a reply could cause unnecessary worry, leading to unexpected actions driven by misunderstandings. Even if I was going through a tough time back then, it had nothing to do with Sayu. It was true that I failed to adhere to basic manners.</p>



<p>No use crying over spilled milk.</p>



<p>It was over.</p>



<p>“I don’t want any more unnecessary mess.” I knocked on the staff room door.</p>



<p>“Excuse me. I apologize for interrupting during lunch break, Kanzaki-sensei. Do you have a moment?”</p>



<p>There was something I needed to confirm with her.</p>
