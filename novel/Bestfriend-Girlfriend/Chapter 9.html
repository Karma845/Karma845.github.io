<h3>Chapter 9 - Overnight stay and thunder</h3>


				
<p>(….Stayover?)</p>



<p>It took him a little while to understand the meaning of those words.</p>



<p>(Stayover…ah, a sleepover. In short, Yui asked me if I wanted to stay at her place today…..)</p>



<p>(──No, wait, what is she talking about!?)</p>



<p>&#8220;D-Don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s a bad idea for a man and a woman of the same age to sleep together!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t particularly care, though? You know, after everything you&#8217;ve done to help me, I still haven&#8217;t been able to pay you back. That&#8217;s why I thought I&#8217;d take this opportunity to do something.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;D-Didn&#8217;t I tell you not to worry about that!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-I want to do it! I&#8217;ve been nothing but a burden all this time and so on, so I want to return the favour!&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui was unusually stubborn.</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, but…&#8221;</p>



<p>Just as he was thinking about how to explain this to his sister…Yuuma recalled the conversation that he had with his sister this morning.</p>



<p>『I have to go away for work today. I&#8217;ll be back tomorrow evening.』</p>



<p>──If I remember correctly, I think that&#8217;s what she said.</p>



<p>……In other words, if I stay over today, my sister won&#8217;t find out about it.</p>



<p>(…Wait, that&#8217;s not the point!? Isn&#8217;t this a very big problem!?)</p>



<p>Yuuma forcibly changed his thoughts, which were about to go in a very dangerous direction.</p>



<p>(No, after all, wouldn&#8217;t you also like to go to Yui&#8217;s house for a sleepover? I have just decided to be affectionate with Yui, so I would like to ask her for a favour. But…isn&#8217;t a sleepover way too much of a step forward…)</p>



<p>As he was thinking so, Yui&#8217;s momentum was gradually weakening.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yui?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…I&#8217;m sorry. I-I didn&#8217;t mean to embarrass Yuuma.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, it&#8217;s okay. I&#8217;m glad you wanted to thank me for something.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui shook her head sideways.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m sorry. That…was an excuse…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Excuse?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah…really…really…&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui grabbed the hem of her shirt tightly. She looked up at Yuuma with moist, lovable eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yuuma…more, I want to be together with you more…&#8221;</p>



<p>　<br>†</p>



<p>(No, why did you say okay, me…)</p>



<p>After that, Yuuma agreed to stay over at Yui&#8217;s house.</p>



<p>(No…no, it&#8217;s no good, right? We&#8217;ve always been close and on edge, but a sleepover at a girl&#8217;s house, as one would expect, is a quintessential no-no, right?)</p>



<p>Nevertheless, he wondered if there was ever a boy in this world who would say no to a girl he liked when she says 『I want to be with you more』. That destructive power…was foul, he thought.</p>



<p>Yuuma calmed himself down.</p>



<p>(W-Well, although that&#8217;s the case. Naturally, Yui&#8217;s parents should be at home, right? No matter how much Yui wants me to have an overnight stay, surely, Yui&#8217;s parents would say otherwise…)</p>



<p>&#8220;My parents aren&#8217;t home today. They&#8217;re working and won&#8217;t be back until tomorrow.&#8221;</p>



<p>(──E-Eeeehhhhhhhhh!?)</p>



<p>Swift attack flag recovery.</p>



<p>He already felt somewhat dizzy.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, it&#8217;s okay to be loud, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>──Yui said it was okay to make as much noise as they wanted when playing games. He understood this in his head. He understood, but…he imagined something improper.</p>



<p>However, he wanted her to forgive him.『 My parents aren&#8217;t home today』is probably one of the best ten things a girl could say to a boy. Probably.</p>



<p>He, later on, followed Yui into the house with a sense of dread.</p>



<p>A clean and neat entrance. For some reason or another, it conveyed the meticulous nature of the homeowner.</p>



<p>He had always sent Yui off in front of her house; however, this was the first time he had gone inside like this. His heart was already racing with Nervousness.</p>



<p>&#8220;P-Please excuse me for the intrusion…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nfufu, I&#8217;m happy. This is the first time I brought a boy along into my home♪.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……….&#8221;</p>



<p>──He was the first boy that Yui brought to her home. Even the thought of such a thing made his heart pound furiously. It felt as if his intelligence had significantly lowered compared to a while ago.</p>



<p>He was guided into the living room.</p>



<p>Similar to the entrance, the living room had a clean and calm atmosphere. And surprisingly, the furniture, and interior design, gave off an overall air brimming with luxury.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hold still, okay? I&#8217;ll get you some tea.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Ah. Don&#8217;t worry about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>He sat down on the large L-shaped sofa in front of the TV.</p>



<p>It was soft and fluffy. Lying down on the sofa must no doubt feel very good.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yui, what do your parents do for a living?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A doctor and a nurse.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Wow, that&#8217;s amazing.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah.♪&#8221;</p>



<p>From the atmosphere, he could tell that the relationship between parent and child looked good. He felt somewhat happy for them.</p>



<p>&#8220;Wait. Here you go.&#8221;</p>



<p>Held in Yui&#8217;s hand were some cake and tea.</p>



<p>She placed it on the glass table in front of the sofa and sat down a little next to Yuuma.</p>



<p>He picked up the teacup and took a light sip.</p>



<p>Delicious. He didn&#8217;t know much about tea, but he was sure it was a high-class one.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s delicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn. Since you&#8217;re an important guest, I brewed you the best tea.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Really? Thanks.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re welcome.&#8221;</p>



<p>Once there, the conversation was cut short.</p>



<p>The two of them enjoyed delicious tea and cakes together.</p>



<p>There was no conversation, but it wasn&#8217;t an awkward silence. If anything, it felt somewhat comfortable. Not an unpleasant silence but a happy one.</p>



<p>Next to him was Yui huffing and puffing, drinking tea little by little. Just by looking at her, he could feel his love beginning to gradually overflow.</p>



<p>──Yui took out her smartphone.</p>



<p>Yuuma also took out his phone. A little later, Pekon♪ , he received a message from Yui.</p>



<p>『Thank you for coming today.』</p>



<p>『No, No, thank you very much for having me.』</p>



<p>『That&#8217;s right. I&#8217;d like to return the favour to you. Yuuma-kun, do you have any requests?』</p>



<p>『Return the favour?』</p>



<p>『Yes. I&#8217;m grateful to you, Yuuma-kun, and I really want to repay the favour.』</p>



<p>『By the way, why did you start using honorifics?』</p>



<p>『I&#8217;m somewhat embarrassed, so I&#8217;m using honorifics to cover it up』</p>



<p>He laughed at her reply. Well, sure, it was normal to be embarrassed when thanking someone. For the one being thanked and for the one thanking, of course.</p>



<p>『I don&#8217;t really have any requests.』</p>



<p>『Is that so? Then, how about today? I&#8217;ll serve Yuuma throughout the day in order to please you. Similar to a maid. 』</p>



<p>『……A maid?』</p>



<p>『Yes, a maid. You like maids, don&#8217;t you?』</p>



<p>『I won&#8217;t deny it.』</p>



<p>(……I mean, frankly, I love it, so yes)</p>



<p>Ah, I completely forgot.</p>



<p>Just the other day, he actually treated Yui as if she was a man when he met her.</p>



<p>Well, in the process, he also told Yui about his many preferences; that is to say…without covering it up, she knows all about his sexual dispositions.</p>



<p>(What should I do, I feel like dying somewhat.)</p>



<p>As Yuuma looked at her with a distant look in his eyes, he received another message from Yui.</p>



<p>『Therefore, Yuuma-kun, may I serve you?』</p>



<p>──Since Yui says she wants to do it, it doesn&#8217;t matter, right? Yuuma thought in his head. Naturally, one should say no in this kind of situation, but to be honest, he was looking forward to seeing what Yui would do for him.</p>



<p>With a small nod, Yuuma also returns the message.</p>



<p>『I understand. Then please serve me as much as you want today.』</p>



<p>When Yuuma replied, Yui made a small fist pump. Cute.</p>



<p>Yui took a deep breath. And then, she held Yuuma&#8217;s clothes and tugged on them a little.</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn. U-Uhm…then, my room…let&#8217;s go?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re room…is it really okay to go in it? I mean, aren&#8217;t you opposed to letting a boy into your room?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;E-Erm. It&#8217;s okay. Don&#8217;t hold back?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui led him upstairs.</p>



<p>At the end of the hall, there was a room with a wooden plate reading 『Yui&#8217;s』 room.</p>



<p>He felt nervous. At any rate, this was the first time in his life he had been in a girl&#8217;s room (Other than Nene)…and it was the room of the girl that he liked.</p>



<p>Similar to him, Yui has also been nervous since some time ago, her movements jerky at times.</p>



<p>&#8220;P-Please.&#8221;</p>



<p>She said, and he went inside. ──It smelled immensely good. That alone made his heart start to race again.</p>



<p>Well, Yui&#8217;s room…how do I say it, was indeed very Yui-like.</p>



<p>It was divided into two areas, the desk and the bed.</p>



<p>The bed area has a lot of stuffed animals, giving off a fluffy, girlish atmosphere.</p>



<p>But, the desk area, on the other hand…was way above that! On the desk was a large and rough gaming computer! Enshrined there was a magnificent gaming chair. Furthermore, next to it, [tada]! Stands a large towering bookshelf, packed compactly with light novels and manga.</p>



<p>──I wonder how many other girls in Japan have all the Ｊ○Ｊ○ volumes?</p>



<p>&#8220;When I was little, I was so frail that I stayed home all the time, so my dad bought me lots of stuffed animals so I wouldn&#8217;t be lonely.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;However, my dad himself was into games, manga and other boyish hobbies; thus, that&#8217;s how I ended up like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-Is it weird?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;No, isn&#8217;t it okay for Yui to like what she wants?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hee-hee, thanks.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Can I see your bookshelf?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>With her permission, he went to the bookshelf. He felt nervous about entering a girl&#8217;s room; however, the area around her desk very much resembles a boy&#8217;s.</p>



<p>Besides, Yuuma and Yui&#8217;s tastes in manga and other things match each other considerably well. So, as one would expect, Yui&#8217;s collection of books was of interest to him as well.</p>



<p>&#8220;I was wondering about this one. Yui, did you enjoy this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It was pretty interesting. The first events feel controversial. But I think Yuuma will like it. If you like, I can lend it to you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Thanks. Then I&#8217;ll borrow it some other time. In return, I&#8217;ll bring over some of my recommendations.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m looking forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>The tension eased a little after having such a conversation.</p>



<p>Regarding hobbies or energy, Yui was the one closest to him. Therefore, playing games together, reading manga and talking together seemed fun and comfortable.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yuuma? I want to thank you soon…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Huh, w-whoa..!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;? Is something wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, it&#8217;s nothing…&#8221;</p>



<p>There was really nothing to scream at. He just turned around and saw Yui sitting down on the bed with a stuffed sheep toy fluffed up to her arms.</p>



<p>However, the area around the bed where Yui was is completely a girl&#8217;s room.</p>



<p>Just a little while ago, he was talking to Yui like she was a boy; however, when he turned around, Yui had become completely girlie, and that gap made him increasingly more and more aware of her.</p>



<p>This is Yui&#8217;s room. This is Yui&#8217;s private space, where she usually sleeps and changes her clothes. Such was the place Yuuma was at.</p>



<p>He instinctively swallowed his saliva.</p>



<p>Fortunately, Yui didn&#8217;t seem to understand what Yuuma was agitated about and gave him a puzzled look. It was at times like this that Yuuma appreciated Yui&#8217;s lack of caution towards boys.</p>



<p>&#8220;So, you said you would thank me, but what are we doing in your room?&#8221;</p>



<p>When he asked her this, Yui wriggled her body in embarrassment.</p>



<p>&#8220;W-Well, you know? I-I, in my own way, have been studying many things. I&#8217;ve been trying to learn what boys long for, w-what boys will be happy with, and so on. I want to do those sorts of things.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Oh, I see.&#8221;</p>



<p>In terms of what boys like, what they might be looking for right now is a girl who does something for them, like Yuuma&#8217;s current situation.</p>



<p>In fact, he was getting a little excited.</p>



<p>What was Yui going to do for me?</p>



<p>Thinking about this, he waited for Yui&#8217;s next words.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, then…bed, let&#8217;s lie down?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Eh? Bed?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, I thought about doing something for Yuuma that makes him feel good…&#8221;</p>



<p>──He froze. His mind flashed back to this morning&#8217;s dream.</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, no, no, no, no!? S-Surely, you adore the boy, but that&#8217;s no good!? No matter how much you like him, you can&#8217;t just say that!? S-Such a thing? Saying even more things in this way…anyway, it&#8217;s no good!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;B-But, the other day, I read in a comic book that the heroine and the boy were…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t lump together two-dimensional and three-dimensional! W-What kind of manga are you reading!?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-Is it really that bad?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Of course, it&#8217;s no good!? S-Such a thing should be properly…wait, what&#8217;s that in your hand?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? It&#8217;s an earpick…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-An earpick.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yeah. An earpick.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What are you using that earpick for?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? What else would I use it for other than cleaning ears?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……Ughhhh.&#8221;</p>



<p>I made a horrible mistake.</p>



<p>He covered his face and fainted in agony. Alas, if there was a hole, he wanted to get in it, or rather, he felt like digging a hole and burying himself in it.</p>



<p>&#8220;Uhm, Yuuma? Ear picking, you don&#8217;t like it? My mom does it for me sometimes, and it feels good, so I wanted to do it for Yuuma too…….&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui&#8217;s words made him feel more and more guilty.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yuuma? So, what do you want me to do?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Ah, yeah. Then, I&#8217;ll have you do it…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Nn. Then, you can use my lap as a pillow and lie down. I&#8217;m a little nervous since this is my first time, but I&#8217;ll be gentle, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>He didn&#8217;t have the energy to say anything else anymore, so he accepted her lap pillow and laid down on her bed as he was told. But then, he realized something.</p>



<p>──Lap pillow with ear-picking, is plenty dangerous.</p>



<p>Imagining something even more worse, his senses went numb.</p>



<p>His head was on the thigh of the girl he liked. It had just the right amount of elasticity and body temperature, and it gave off a sweet smell. And finally, above all else, she allowed this sense of distance between them. This was way too much stimulation for a boy in puberty.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yui, this is a bit…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t move. It&#8217;s dangerous…&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui said in a serious voice, gently rubbing the inside of Yuuma&#8217;s ear with an earpick.</p>



<p>&#8220;H-HYA!?&#8221;</p>



<p>A strange voice came out, and he hurriedly covered his mouth in a panic.</p>



<p>&#8220;S-Sorry, did that hurt?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-No, it doesn&#8217;t hurt, but…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see, then. Let&#8217;s keep going, shall we?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;A-Ah, h-hey, w-wait..~~~!?&#8221;</p>



<p>──Picking his ears while giving him a lap pillow.</p>



<p>He had seen it frequently in comic books, and he certainly longed for it. But when he actually tried it…that is, by this time, it was way beyond heaven and torture.</p>



<p>The sensation of being stroked inside his sensitive ears sent shivers down his spine, even though he was at his limit with the lap pillow.</p>



<p>One could say pleasure is a faint sensation. However, in this situation, it became a vicious one. Moreover, from the very moment he felt Yui&#8217;s breath and serious gaze, his mind was no longer in possession of itself.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuuma, does it feel good?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…It feels good.&#8221;</p>



<p>If he had to say whether it felt good or bad, it felt good. However, feeling good in some cases can also become hell.</p>



<p>Yui, oblivious to such male instincts, smiled happily and said,</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;m glad.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;H-Hey, Yui.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;What?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You do know that I&#8217;m a guy, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, of course.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um…don&#8217;t you think it&#8217;s embarrassing? Girls are usually embarrassed by this sort of thing, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…To be honest, I&#8217;m a little embarrassed.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;If that&#8217;s the case…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But…right? I love Yuuma lots.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui said so without hesitation and smiled shyly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Perhaps, I like Yuuma much more than Yuuma thinks? It feels somewhat comforting when I touch you like this, and I feel happy when you&#8217;re happy. Just being together makes me feel awfully happy…&#8221;</p>



<p>From the calmness of her voice, it can be conveyed that she really loves Yuuma.</p>



<p>&#8220;That…does Yuuma hate this sort of thing? I&#8217;ll stop it if you don&#8217;t like it…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…I don&#8217;t hate it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Then can I continue?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;….Yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui let out a small smile, and continued to carefully clean his ears.</p>



<p>──I can&#8217;t help but be happy after hearing such a thing from the girl I liked.</p>



<p>However, just for a moment, his face felt so hot that he couldn&#8217;t look at Yui&#8217;s face directly.</p>



<p>&#8220;…You really are like that…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? Did you say something?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-It&#8217;s nothing…&#8221;</p>



<p>It took him a while to be able to look at Yui&#8217;s face, even after ear-picking came to an end.</p>



<p>†</p>



<p>『Then, next, do you want me to serve you some of my home cooking?』</p>



<p>When Yuuma had calmed down, Yui made such a suggestion in the chat again.</p>



<p>『Home cooking?』</p>



<p>『Yes. I got this knowledge from manga, anime and so on, and it&#8217;s said that from the standpoint of boys, they long to have a girl&#8217;s home-cooked meal. Wouldn&#8217;t Yuuma-kun be happy about it too?』</p>



<p>Well, definitely.</p>



<p>For some reason or another, he was longing for a girl&#8217;s home-cooked meal, and it would be special if the girl he liked made it for him. Though…</p>



<p>『 Cooking, are you able to do it?』</p>



<p>『Mou~, do you think I&#8217;m some useless member of society who can&#8217;t do anything by myself? I&#8217;m pretty good at housework in general, you know? Especially cooking, I eclipse even professionals.』</p>



<p>『You&#8217;re that good at it!?』</p>



<p>『Sorry, I exaggerated it a little. But it&#8217;s true that I&#8217;m good at it, so please let me treat you.』</p>



<p>『Then, that being the case, please treat me.』</p>



<p>When he replied, Yui smiled happily once again. Even a casual conversation with Yui felt immensely fun. And with cooking, there won&#8217;t be anything similar to ear-picking.</p>



<p>『So, how&#8217;s the space in your stomach?』</p>



<p>『It&#8217;s going down nicely.』</p>



<p>『Well, it&#8217;s a little early, but let&#8217;s cook.』</p>



<p>Yui got up and headed for the ground floor, where the kitchen was located. He followed a little behind her.</p>



<p>Once in the kitchen, Yui opened the refrigerator and began to seriously examine its contents.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, Yuuma. Do you like hamburg steak?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I do.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Can you eat carrots and broccoli?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t hate it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Un. Then, for the main dish, I&#8217;ll make a hamburg steak, and have carrot glacé​ and broccoli for the garnish…but it&#8217;ll be lonely with just that, so I&#8217;m going to make some soup…okay, I have the coffee jelly.&#8221;</p>



<p>──Coffee jelly…is that for dessert? To be honest, I don&#8217;t like it very much, but I&#8217;ll put up with it.</p>



<p>While thinking about this in the corner of his mind, he watches Yui take the ingredients out of the refrigerator.</p>



<p>&#8220;I&#8217;ll help you with something.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuuma is our guest, so you can relax, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I want to help…I mean, wouldn&#8217;t it be more fun to do these kinds of things together, don&#8217;t you agree?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;……Un♪.&#8221;</p>



<p>Thus, that&#8217;s how he ended up helping with the cooking.</p>



<p>Yui tied her hair up into a ponytail using a rubber band. The nape of her neck, which was usually hidden by her hair, was visible. In this way, changing her hairstyle also changed the room&#8217;s atmosphere considerably.</p>



<p>Following that, she donned the thin pink apron she usually wore and lent Yuuma a black apron, which her father used.</p>

<p>……A change in hairstyle, what she looks like with an apron on, such trivial things made his heart pound faster and faster. He was at a loss for what to do.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuuma, can you cook?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Not much. I took an economics class which taught me how to make frozen foods at home, but that&#8217;s about it.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well then, since we&#8217;re here, why don&#8217;t you let me teach you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Sure.&#8221;</p>



<p>What Yui said about being a good cook was apparently true.</p>



<p>She executed everything with a familiar hand, working quickly and efficiently without looking at the books. There was no hesitation in her movements at all.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Speaking of the coffee jelly, what&#8217;re you going to use it for?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s a secret ingredient for the hamburg steak.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Seriously? Is that going to be okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s delicious, trust me.&#8221;</p>



<p>Without hesitation, Yui boldly threw the coffee jelly onto the ground meat, which was meant for the Hamburg.</p>



<p>&#8220;Where did you get this kind of knowledge?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;The internet….Even as a child, my body was fragile, which troubled both my father and mother. Because of that, I at least wanted to do my best to learn housework.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I see. That&#8217;s great.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hee-hee. So, I went online and looked up some secret ingredients and tricks, among other things. This coffee jelly is going to be really delicious, so please look forward to it.&#8221;</p>



<p>In the end, regardless of whether it&#8217;s earnest or admirable, Yui seems to be the type of person who cares about the favours she&#8217;s received.</p>



<p>…Why, even my heart is somehow touched.</p>



<p>&#8220;The hamburg steak is pressed to draw out the air sufficiently, right? And then, in the end, you smooth the surface…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Like this?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Good, good.&#8221;</p>



<p>──Suddenly, I wondered if this was what it would be like if I married Yui.</p>



<p>Immediately, he shook off that fantasy. It&#8217;s not good to be thinking about that now, especially when I&#8217;m cooking.</p>



<p>&#8220;When grilling, use high heat at first to trap the juices inside……&#8221;</p>



<p>Just standing next to her in this way was making him overflow with love. He wanted to hug Yui as much as he could.</p>



<p>In the meantime, cooking came to an end. To be frank, half of what he was taught didn&#8217;t even register in his head.</p>



<p>They placed their finished dishes on the plate and set them on the table. Sitting opposite each other, the both of them clapped their hands together and said: &#8220;Itadakimasu&#8221; (Thank you for the food).</p>



<p>&#8220;Now…&#8221;</p>



<p>Hamburg steak paired with coffee jelly.</p>



<p>He felt a little nervous seeing her put in it without hesitation, but at least it looked normal…not to mention it looked like something that you could serve in a restaurant.</p>



<p>There was no problem with the smell. However, when it comes to that, the problem was usually the taste…as a matter of fact, Yuuma, who didn&#8217;t like coffee, felt anxious and thought in his head, 『Wouldn&#8217;t you only be able to taste coffee since you put so much in it?』</p>



<p>He cut it open with his chopsticks. Then, the juices seeped out from the inside with an appetizing smell.</p>



<p>(…looks delicious.)</p>



<p>Mouth overflowing with saliva, he took a bite right away.</p>



<p>Munch.</p>



<p>Juwah.</p>



<p>The meat came loose as he bit into it, and the flavour filled his mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;…So?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s extremely delicious.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hee-hee♪. Right?&#8221;</p>



<p>In fact, it&#8217;s absurdly delicious. Yui said she 『exaggerated』 it, but it really could be described as professional.</p>



<p>──Cute, matching hobbies, being good at cooking…isn&#8217;t this already an ideal wife?</p>



<p>He thought of it once again and hurriedly shook it off. In order to get it out of his head, he shovelled rice into his mouth. The somewhat strong Worcestershire sauce matched well with the hamburg steak.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah, Yuuma. You have some rice grains on you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Where?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Here.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui reached out and picked up the grain of rice that was attached to Yuuma&#8217;s mouth. And then, without closing her eyes, she puts it into her mouth.</p>



<p>&#8220;Like. I. Said! Why are you always so…Gaah, geez!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;?&#8221;</p>



<p>Afterwards, they finished eating and cleaned up together.</p>



<p>Yui washed the dishes, and Yuuma wiped them with a cloth.</p>



<p>He had done housework at home before, but it was a tedious task, to say the least.</p>



<p>However, working side by side with Yui like this felt really fun.</p>



<p>&#8220;Mou~, how many times must I say this? Yuuma is a guest, so please sit down.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know you&#8217;ve said it many times, but I want to help. Besides, is doing something together like this only fun for me and not for Yui?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…It&#8217;s fun, but this is no way to repay you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;You&#8217;re a pretty stubborn girl. You really don&#8217;t have to worry about thanking me, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>Although he said that, Yui seemed unconvinced.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuuma, did you know? I…really, really, appreciate you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What&#8217;s the matter with you?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Yuuma, do you still remember the first time we met in person?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Well, yeah.&#8221;</p>



<p>How could I forget? It was a shocking encounter. In many ways.</p>



<p>&#8220;At that time, I had a terrible communicative disorder. I couldn&#8217;t speak well, and I was worried about the stares and the whispering voices around me…but, you know what? Now, with Yuuma, I enjoy talking, and I&#8217;m not afraid to go outside…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yui was the one who did her best.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah. But it was thanks to Yuuma that I did my best. …Do you know? I advanced on to high school, but I didn&#8217;t really want to go.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes. I was bad at communicating and never had any friends, and I thought that even if I went to high school, it would be boring, and I would be isolated and bullied, so I thought it would be better not to go. But guess what? I&#8217;m looking forward to starting high school now that I have Yuuma with me.&#8221;</p>



<p>She finished washing the dishes as she said that. Yui wiped her hands as she turned to him once again.</p>



<p>&#8220;Now, every day is wonderful. Today was fun, and I&#8217;m sure tomorrow will also be fun, and now I&#8217;m even looking forward to going to school, which I was so afraid of doing. This happiness is all thanks to you…for that reason, I want to thank you properly! Otherwise, my feelings won&#8217;t settle down!&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yes, yes. Then you can take your time to pay me back. T-That is…by staying together with me from now on.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Un! Y-Yes! That&#8217;s right, hee-hee♪.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui laughed with delight.</p>



<p>He reached out his hand to stroke the girl&#8217;s head, feeling an irresistible urge to do so. However, he stopped his hand mid-stroke, thinking it would be a bad idea to touch the girl&#8217;s hair too casually.</p>



<p>It was then that Yui seemingly noticed that Yuuma was trying to pat her head. However, she didn&#8217;t run away and leaned her head in the direction of his hand.</p>



<p>When he stopped his hand mid-stroke, Yui looked at him, as if wanting to say, 『Aren&#8217;t you going to pat my head?』.</p>



<p>Stroking her head in response to her begging gaze, Yui squinted her eyes like a kitten. The way she acted conveyed how happy she was having her head stroked. Then, she rubbed her head into Yuuma&#8217;s hand as if to say, 『more』.</p>



<p>(……What a cute creature)</p>



<p>Yuuma continued to stroke Yui&#8217;s head for a while.</p>



<p>　†</p>



<p>Time passed as they got along like that, doing chores and playing together.</p>



<p>After getting out of the bath, Yuuma sat on the bed, drying her hair.</p>



<p>Yui was in a good mood, humming, not knowing that Yuuma was at her mercy from the aroma of her shampoo paired along with the sight of her in her pyjamas.</p>



<p>&#8220;Is it intense?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Un, it&#8217;s okay. Yuuma, thank you~.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s pretty hard to dry long hair, right? Well, don&#8217;t worry.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hee-hee, I wish it was like this every day.&#8221;</p>



<p>Those words struck him once again.</p>



<p>(──She&#8217;s saying those kinds of things without hesitation again.)</p>



<p>Yui closed her eyes once again, unaware of the people around her.</p>



<p>──I think Yui probably thinks of me as a safe and secure older brother.</p>



<p>He was glad that she trusted him and liked him. However, he felt a little complicated. Naturally, he wanted her to be aware of him as a member of the opposite sex, even if it&#8217;s only a little.</p>



<p>He finished drying her hair. Yui was in great satisfaction with the fluffy finish.</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s time to go to bed now.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;That&#8217;s right. …Hey, Yuuma?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Just so you know, you can&#8217;t sleep with me, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ehh…&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuuma let out a strained laugh, wondering if she was really going to do it, even though she only said it half-jokingly.</p>



<p>&#8220;Come on, you…don&#8217;t you think you&#8217;re in any danger at all?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Danger?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, you know, like if I attacked you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;But Yuuma isn&#8217;t someone who would do that, right?&#8221;</p>



<p>She replied with a puzzled look on her face.</p>



<p>──Well, I actually won&#8217;t. I had a feeling if I did something that made Yui cry, I would definitely feel guilty and want to die afterwards. However, our bodies react as a physiological response…and considering the dangers, sure enough, I shouldn&#8217;t sleep close to her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Anyway, it&#8217;s no good.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Muu~&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui was unhappy. However, she hesitantly accepted when he made a compromise to sleep in the same bed as her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Whatever you do, don&#8217;t cross this line, okay? I&#8217;ll get angry if you cross it, understand?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Un.&#8221;</p>



<p>A boundary was built in the middle of the bed using stuffed animals.</p>



<p>(Usually, I think it&#8217;s the girls who do these kinds of precautions.)</p>



<p>They both lay down on the bed.</p>



<p>Smelling Yui&#8217;s sweet scent from the bed, his heart pounded even more furiously. He was fatigued after everything that had happened, but he wondered, could he even sleep in these conditions?</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yuuma?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yuuma and Yui were in a position facing each other.</p>



<p>Somewhat anxious, Yui asked him,</p>



<p>&#8220;Did you have fun today?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Yeah, it was fun.&#8221;</p>



<p>He answered without hesitation.</p>



<p>Yui was really defenceless, not understanding the sense of distance between a man and woman, making him an easy target to be pushed around.</p>



<p>However, he loved that part of her, he enjoyed being pushed around, and he was happy to spend time with her like this.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, Yui.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;W-What?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I love you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hee-hee♪. Me too.&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui smiled happily.</p>



<p>(Well, that&#8217;s the sort of reaction I get. I guess there was no point in being nervous about what I said, but.)</p>



<p>He reached out his hand and patted her head. To which Yui accepted delightfully.</p>



<p>──I guess there was no point in being so worked up, but…maybe this kind of relationship isn&#8217;t so bad after all.</p>



<p>After a while, Yui began to sleep peacefully.</p>



<p>She must have been sleepy from all the excitement she had been through.</p>



<p>Yuuma, on the other hand, was a little sleep-deprived, so he decided to play with his phone until he fell asleep.</p>



<p>He turned his back so that the light from his phone didn&#8217;t wake Yui up. For the time being, he started reading an E-book that he had bought.</p>



<p>And then, less than two hours later. He finished reading one of those light novels.</p>



<p>…A romantic comedy with a dull main character, but he felt a mess of emotions toward the heroine.</p>



<p>(I know, right? Isn&#8217;t it painful to not be noticed at all? I understood that very well.)</p>



<p>As he was sympathizing with the unfortunate heroine──pitter, patter, he heard a sound.</p>



<p>(… rain?)</p>



<p>He listened carefully. Eventually, the sound of rain (pitter-patter) turned to the sound of &#8220;zzzzz&#8221; as the rain began to fall.</p>



<p>Lately, he thought the weather was unstable when he saw a flash of lightning outside.</p>



<p>After a gap of about three seconds, the sound of thunder vibrated the air.</p>



<p>The glass door was shaking.</p>



<p>A few moments later, it flashed again. This time, after about two seconds, there was a roar. It was huge. And it was getting closer and closer…and then, there was a thump on his back.</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yui!? H-Hey! Don&#8217;t cross the line…Yui?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui was clinging to Yuuma&#8217;s back. Her small body was shaking and trembling.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yui?&#8221;</p>



<p>He turned his body. Yui had become as small as a frightened little animal.</p>



<p>It flashed again. And a second later, there was another roar.</p>



<p>&#8220;Kyaaa!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui screamed.</p>



<p>&#8220;…Are you bad with lightning?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui rigorously nodded.</p>



<p>Appearing really hopeless and trembling with a frightened look.</p>



<p>Seeing Yui like that──Yuuma tightly hugged her.</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;It&#8217;s going to be okay. Don&#8217;t be afraid. I&#8217;ll stay like this until the thunder goes away, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…Yes.&#8221;</p>



<p>Honestly, various emotions were going around in his head, but he believed he had to do it this way. His body naturally moved when he thought that he should protect Yui, who was frightened.</p>



<p>Yui hugged him back with all her strength, and he felt something soft hitting him, making him uneasy. However, Yui&#8217;s body stopped shaking.</p>



<p>Another 30 minutes passed. The thunderclouds seemed to have moved far away.</p>



<p>He gently let go of Yui&#8217;s body so as not to wake her.</p>



<p>(Even though she&#8217;s unaware of a person&#8217;s true nature, she can still sleep peacefully like that.)</p>



<p>The relaxed expression on her face was very innocent, making her look more and more like a small animal.</p>



<p>Just looking at her peaceful expressions makes him feel somewhat happy.</p>



<p>Unable to resist, he gently hugged her again.</p>



<p>She was soft all over. He continued to stroke the area around the back of her head.</p>



<p>Then she let out a small &#8220;mmm……&#8221; and rubbed her head against Yuuma&#8217;s chest like a kitten.</p>



<p>(…Cute.)</p>



<p>──He felt a flood of love pouring out of him. He loved her as the opposite sex, a close friend, and as a younger sister.</p>



<p>He wanted to make her his. He wanted to make her happy. He wanted to protect her. He loved her. Such feelings swelled up in his heart.</p>



<p>He had intended to just stroke her, but he wanted to touch her a little more.</p>



<p>He gently touched her fine, milky-white cheeks with his fingertips.</p>



<p>They were smooth, springy, and slightly warm. He wanted to touch her continuously.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ni~yu~u……&#8221;</p>



<p>While Yui was asleep, a ticklish smile surfaced on her face.</p>



<p>She showed no signs of getting up, but he decided not to go any further. That was what he thought as he tried to retract his hand.</p>



<p>&#8220;Yuu…ma…&#8221;</p>



<p>His heart skipped a beat when she called his name.</p>



<p>Yui was still asleep. She must be dreaming.</p>



<p>…Yui was dreaming about me.</p>



<p>His heart pounded rapidly again at the thought of it.</p>



<p>Suddenly, his eyes fell on the lightly opened cherry-red lips.</p>



<p>──Kiss, I want to do it. He thought so. Immediately, he shook off that thought.</p>



<p>No, I can&#8217;t do that. Robbing a girl&#8217;s lips while she&#8217;s sleeping is disgusting. I would never do that.</p>



<p>But …..this time, reason got the better of him a little.</p>



<p>He touched Yui&#8217;s lips with the pad of his index finger, just a little bit.</p>



<p>It felt surprisingly soft. He had touched Yui&#8217;s body here and there, but this was softer than any of them.</p>



<p>He immediately withdrew his hand. Aware that it was no good to go any further.</p>



<p>After that, he was too nervous to fall asleep.</p>



<p>At last, after several hours, was he finally able to fall asleep.</p>
