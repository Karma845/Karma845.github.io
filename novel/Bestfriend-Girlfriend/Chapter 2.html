<h2>Chapter 2: Heroine Mihaneya Getsuka, Yet the Main Story Is About a Man’s Underwear</h2>

<p>Those crows…were considerably skilled – no, vicious. <br /> <br />Returning to the classroom, I look around while still rubbing my sore butt and crotch.  <br /> <br />Already by late April, groups had of course formed in class. Their sizes varied from big to small, but everyone was sneaking glances my way without approaching to talk to me. <br /> <br />Well, it’s understandable. To a guy who declared he was wearing his mother’s underwear—plus for some reason now wearing athletic pants on just my lower half, anyone would want to avoid getting involved.  <br /> <br />But this is bad…the situation is quite bad. Messing up and getting isolated on the first day of transfer school is a major blunder. <br /> <br />The “standing out” I want to avoid isn’t just the positive kind like making people laugh or achieving results in club activities. If you swing to the negative extreme, you can stand out plenty too…like me now.  <br /> <br />What I’m aiming for isn’t the popular kids at the top of the caste or some lone wolf always reading books by themselves…but belonging to the intermediate group, able to fully enjoy school life free of both praise and criticism.  <br /> <br />But it has to be said that plan has become quite difficult now. With uncertain elements like misfortune and the choices added to the mix, turning things around from here feels truly hopeless— <br /> <br />“Hello!” <br /> <br />A voice called out, and turning around, a girl with a beaming smile stood there. <br /> <br />“Oh, uh, hi…you are?” <br /> <br />“I’m Mihaneya Getsuka! Pleased to meet you!”  <br /> <br />The girl flashed her gleaming white teeth cheerfully. <br /> <br />“Miha…neya?” <br /> <br />“I know, the kanji is hard to read right? Mi is the mi in tori no mi for feather, hane is wing, ya is house so Mihaneya. Getsu for moon, ka for flower so Getsuka!” <br /> <br />“Mihaneya Getsuka…” <br /> <br />“Yes!” <br /> <br />The girl who introduced herself as Mihaneya nodded with a guileless expression. <br /> <br />“So um…did you need something from me?” <br /> <br />“Ootomo-san, would you perhaps like to be friends with me?” <br /> <br />“Huh? …Seriously?” <br /> <br />“Yes, seriously!” <br /> <br />What an unhoped for development! Having already started to isolate myself, there could be nothing more welcome. <br /> <br />But wait.  <br /> <br />“Mihaneya, don’t take this the wrong way but…why did you suddenly think to try being friends with someone like me who messed up like that?” <br /> <br />Especially such a cute girl. It would be only natural for her to view me with disdain.  <br /> <br />“Ahaha, it’s my duty to maintain smooth class relationships!” <br /> <br />“Duty? Oh, could you be the class rep for the girls or something?” <br /> <br />“No no, that’s the girl with glasses over in that group. She was disdainful of you Ootomo-san, so she likely wouldn’t approach I think.” <br /> <br />…Of course. <br /> <br />“Well, that can’t be helped…but if you aren’t the class rep, who are you?” <br /> <br />“[Ten Sai].” <br /> <br />“—!?” <br /> <br />Wh-Whaat… <br /> <br />I knew they had been featured on the news, but I had only been half listening while messing with my smartphone so I didn’t grasp the individual members. I can’t believe I’d encounter one right off the bat here… <br /> <br />She certainly has a cute face and charm. I don’t know about duty or whatever, but since she’s reaching out to someone she doesn’t know like me, her personality must be good too. On top of that, if she has some kind of talent befitting her selection for Japan’s top high schoolers, it’s a credible story.  <br /> <br />And from her behavior she seems to clearly have good communication skills. If I can become close with her, maybe she can build bridges to the other students for me. <br /> <br />My concern is that she’s [Ten Sai]. <br /> <br />I should absolutely avoid contact with such attention-grabbing individuals, but…I don’t have the luxury to be choosy in my current state. It’s many times better than stubbornly continuing down loner street. <br /> <br />“…I’m in your debt, Mihaneya.”  <br /> <br />“Oh no, I’m just doing what’s only natural.” <br /> <br />Mihaneya smiled brightly again…she seems like an awesome person. <br /> <br />“But it’s amazing you know. [Ten Sai] is like celebrities. I didn’t watch in detail, but you were featured on the news recently right? Don’t you also take interviews and such for other media?” <br /> <br />“Ahaha, there are members like that, yes. I did my best to appear on that news because the school strongly insisted but…I basically turn down everything else. I’m a little bad with that kind of thing…I don’t really like standing out itself.” <br /> <br />N-No way…For someone selected as [Ten Sai] to have similar thoughts as me of not wanting to stand out…I feel a tinge of sympathy for Mihaneya.  <br /> <br />“But even without external exposure, aren’t you the center of attention in school?” <br /> <br />“Yes. As [Ten Sai], I’m obligated to serve as a model for all the school’s students, and be perfect in everything no matter when or what. I have to constantly mind my behavior in life…recently it’s been a bit tiring…” <br /> <br />There, Mihaneya smiled somewhat awkwardly.  <br /> <br />“When I talked about duty and such earlier…the truth is that was a lie. Having everyone in class – in school – see me only as [Ten Sai] has been painful…I wanted friends who would see me as Mihaneya Getsuka.” <br /> <br />“Mihaneya…” </p>



<p>“I’m sorry…you’re disillusioned by such calculating reasons aren’t you.” <br /> <br />“Huh? No, it’s not that but…I was just a little surprised is all.” <br /> <br />“Surprised?” <br /> <br />“Yeah. I’m sorry for the prejudice, but I thought [Ten Sai] were like monsters or superhumans. But talking, you seem like a normal girl in a good way…so anyway, it doesn’t matter how it came about. I’m truly grateful you approached someone like me who messed up like that.”  <br /> <br />“Ootomo-san…” <br /> <br />“Pleased to meet you Mihaneya, if you’ll have me.” <br /> <br />When I held out my hand, the clouded expression left Mihaneya’s face, replaced by a smile.  <br /> <br />“Y-Yes! Likewise, pleased to—Kyaahhhhh!” <br /> <br />“Wh-What happened all of a sudden!?” <br /> <br />Letting out a bizarre cry, Mihaneya pointed under the desk with a shaking hand.  <br /> <br />“C-C-Cock…cockroach!” <br /> <br />“Cockroach? …Oh there, huh. But that’s—” <br /> <br />“Wh-What are you doing! Hurry, hurry do something about it! Please!” <br /> <br />“No, even if you say do something, that’s—” <br /> <br />“Eek, how can you grab it with your hands! D-Don’t come near me! No, don’t come this wa— gyaaahhh!” <br /> <br />Crash bang! <br /> <br />Mihaneya had dived headlong into the desk she knocked over in her panic.  <br /> <br />“Whoa, you okay…?” <br /> <br />“I-I said don’t come near me! Ootomo-san you idiot!” <br /> <br />“Calm down. This isn’t a cockroach but…a balled up chocolate wrapper.”  <br /> <br />“Huh…?” <br /> <br />I crouched down and held up the thing in my hand before Mihaneya’s eyes.  <br /> <br />“It’s not a…cockroach?” <br /> <br />“Yeah…it doesn’t really resemble one at all aside from being brown.” <br /> <br />“…………………………..Oh…pardon me.”  <br /> <br />Mihaneya cleared her throat, stood up, put back the desk and chair she had knocked down, then faced me again— <br /> <br />“W-Well then! Pleased to make your acquaintance!” <br /> <br />“I don’t think you can just restart from there…” <br /> <br />“Uu…it’s the gap!” <br /> <br />“The gap?” <br /> <br />“Yes! Rather than a girl without any flaws, perfectly endowed with beauty and talent, one who’s a little easily frightened is more moe right! That gap!” <br /> <br />While it’s true a perfect person’s weak points can be appealing elements…I don’t know, this doesn’t feel like that kind of thing to me.  <br /> <br />“Hey Mihaneya.” <br /> <br />“Y-Yes?” <br /> <br />“You really are [Ten Sai] right?” <br /> <br />“Guhk!” <br /> <br />It’s my first time seeing someone actually say that… <br /> <br />“H-How rude…on what grounds do you say such a thing?” <br /> <br />“Well, not so much grounds as something felt off but…no way, you actually suck at it?” <br /> <br />“Th-That’s not it at all! Please don’t say such groundless things! I’m begging you, stop!” <br /> <br />Mihaneya’s eyes swam around and she started going hyuu hyuu, puckering her lips. She was probably trying to whistle but sadly, not a single note came out. <br /> <br />“…Just a little, could you demonstrate your talent for me?” <br /> <br />“T-Talent?” <br /> <br />“Yeah, you’re [Ten Sai] so you must excel at something right?” <br /> <br />“Oh that huh. Fufun…I’m a genius.”  <br /> <br />“At what?” <br /> <br />“Wh-At what…a genius is a genius. It’s not something that’s limited to some field.” <br /> <br />…..Suspicious. <br /> <br />“What’s the difference between differential and integral calculus?” <br /> <br />“Wh-Why so sudden…” <br /> <br />“Nevermind super detailed, just explain briefly.” <br /> <br />“Um, uh…” <br /> <br />Sweat rapidly beaded on Mihaneya’s forehead.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://storage.ko-fi.com/cdn/useruploads/display/c595adc5-f35e-4133-bdd5-3300f2e49bbc_00013.jpeg" alt="" /></div></figure>

<p>“W-Well…differential is like a relative of x…integral is y mutated…and number cruncher Takashi-kun who went out on errands is closely involved I believe.” <br /> <br />“Who are said to be the three great beauties of the world?” <br /> <br />“Umm…King Da<em>‘s Yang Guifei, Ono no Komachi, and I think it was KataCarne’s…P</em>g Princess?”  <br /> <br />“What chmeical element is represented by the letter He in the alphabet?”  <br /> <br />“He…hernia.”  <br /> <br />“You’re a total idiot!” <br /> <br />No way, she has to be joking…there’s no way she could enter Ten Sai with grades like this.  <br /> <br />“N-No! See, it’s that…geniuses skip the process and arrive at the solution, so they can’t convey it to ordinary people and…” <br /> <br />“The problem is your solution itself is wrong.” <br /> <br />“Ugh…but school studies have absolutely no use once you enter society right!?” <br /> <br />It’s my first time seeing someone actually say that….. <br /> <br />“I can’t see someone who thinks [a herniated disc state] is an element being useful in society.”  <br /> <br />“Uu…oh, I see the kind of person you are…s-so don’t be fooled. Did you misunderstand thinking my talent was in academics? Tsk tsk tsk. You’re mistaken you see. It’s sports! My talent lies in extremely athletic reflexes.”  <br /> <br />Looks like she’s resolved to admit her stupidity.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“Sports huh…what competition?” <br /> <br />“Not any particular competition. I’m a monster when it comes to athletic reflexes.” <br /> <br />“Hmm…” <br /> <br />I took a notebook out of my desk and tore out a page, crumpling it up into a ball which I softly tossed at Mihaneya. <br /> <br />“Wah, wah, eek!” <br /> <br />The paper ball slipped through her flailing hands and conked her on the forehead before falling to the floor. <br /> <br />“Monster athletic reflexes huh.” <br /> <br />“N-No! That was just fluke this time…because it was a ball. It ju-just barely missed…” <br /> <br />“Athletic talent zero, intelligence quotient zero, gag sense zero.”  <br /> <br />“Could you stop writing memos!” <br /> <br />“You’re definitely not part of [Ten Sai].” <br /> <br />“I’m a Ten Sai!”  <br /> <br />“You’re not Ten Sai.” <br /> <br />“No, I am Ten Sai.” <br /> <br />“No way you’re Ten Sai.”  <br /> <br />“If I say I’m Ten Sai then I’m Ten Sai! I am Ten Sai you hear!” <br /> <br />“Hmm…well if you won’t admit it, fine. I’ll just look it up for a bit.” <br /> <br />They were featured on TV after all. The member list for [Ten Sai] must be all over the net. <br /> <br />“Wah! I-It’d be better not to carelessly search for me! If you do, you’ll be erased!” <br /> <br />By who. <br /> <br />Just then, the speakers in the front upper corner of the classroom sounded the school broadcast.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Ya see.” <br /> <br />“No, I won’t leave this spot until Ootomo-san acknowledges I’m Ten Sai.” <br /> <br />“But they said immediately.”  <br /> <br />It doesn’t matter. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“See, they’re hurrying you. The classrooms have security cameras right? Are you being seen on them still in the classroom?” <br /> <br />“It’s fine. If they had business, they should come here themselves right? Fufun, calling me out like that, not in a hundred ye—” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Way to get busted obviously!”  <br /> <br />“Guh…b-but, it seems my steady efforts are already bearing fruit. Fufun, sorry about that…deceiving those innocent new students.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Uwah… <br /> <br />“Fufun, in the end you couldn’t get me to leave the classroom. I’ll graciously call it even.”  <br /> <br />No way, you’re totally not bearing it right? To have that kind of public execution broadcast to the entire school…thi-this girl…she must be quite a bigshot— <br /> <br />“Idiot.” <br /> <br />“What’s with suddenly looking at someone’s face!?” <br /> <br />“Oh, my bad, it just slipped out but…you’ve got some serious mental fortitude huh.” <br /> <br />“Well, since the students here have strong individuality, the teachers have tight oversight. I’ve been scolded a number of times already so I’m used to it. Though only the principal is unforgiving to the point I’d rather die than face her again…please excuse me from that…” <br /> <br />As expected of Ten Sai…I have to be even more inconspicuous.  <br /> <br />“Anyway, why were you lying to me?” <br /> <br />“Fufun, isn’t it obvious? This is the first time in a week since I transferred that I met someone more pathetic than me. Of course I’d want the upper hand.” <br /> <br />She’s naturally terrible. <br /> <br />“I intended to trick you by acting like [an energetic girl overflowing with talent but slightly mentally weak] and make you an obedient puppet who’ll listen to everything I say but—Ootomo-san was smarter than I thought, so I failed.” <br /> <br />Terrible to an extreme degree. <br /> <br />“Oh, are you disillusioned? Teehee, too bad. Even though my face is cute I’m quite the villain you see.” <br /> <br />Saying that, Mihaneya showed an evil laugh.  <br /> <br />“Oii, Getsuka-chaan.” <br /> <br />Just then, a female student came trotting over going te te te.  <br /> <br />“How’d it go? You’re getting along well with Ootomo-kun right? I was worried you were pitifully alone the whole break til now.”  <br /> <br />“Could you not ruin my villain moment by exposing me!?” <br /> <br />…A perfectly nice person.  <br /> <br />“N-No! I carefully observed my prey and launched my hunt at the perfect timing when he was weakest at lunch break. If you were worried, wouldn’t you have called out right away!?” <br /> </p>



<p>I had decided to trick her by pretending to be embarrassed in order to avoid getting made fun of for my true self, but I just couldn’t bring myself to go through with it because of the guilt.  <br /> <br />So why are you exposing me!? <br /> <br />…She was a petty criminal who just couldn’t let go of people’s kindness. <br /> <br />“Um…anyway, how about you?” <br /> <br />I turned my gaze to a girl who seemed to be Mihaneya’s friend. <br /> <br />“Oh, sorry. I’m Suzuki, Getsuka’s only friend.”  <br /> <br />“Do you really have to emphasize ‘only’ like that…?” <br /> <br />“But it’s true, isn’t it, Getsuka? Despite being a mess, you act all cocky, so you stand out in a bad way and have a hard time blending in. But our class has a lot of nice people, so it’s not like you’re actively excluded or shunned. You’re in that delicate position of being just slightly out of place.”  <br /> <br />“Could you please stop analyzing me so accurately!?” <br /> <br />“Ahaha! Anyway, I should head back soon, but want to come eat lunch together?” <br /> <br />“Uh, no thanks! Your friends all like to tease me, so no!” <br /> <br />“Well of course they do. There’s no one else like you at Teiou Academy—I mean, there are no other weirdoes with so many openings to poke fun at—so they just can’t help but find you adorable.” <br /> <br />“You totally almost called me an idiot just now!” <br /> <br />“Yup.”  <br /> <br />“At least try to deny it a little!” <br /> <br />Suzuki waved and left, laughing. That girl is a total S, I guess… Well, seems like she’d get along well with Mihaneya at least. <br /> <br />“A-Anyway…let’s get back on topic. Whether I’m a Ten Sai or not, the fact remains that you’re alone, Ootomo-kun… Fufun, if you reeeally want, I suppose I could be your friend.” <br /> <br />“Hard pass.” <br /> <br />“I see. Fufun, can’t be helped then. If that’s how you feel, what—pass!?” <br /> <br />“Yeah, because either way you’d stand out, and not in a good way.”  <br /> <br />“Ehehe…” <br /> <br />Hey, I clearly meant it in a bad way, so why’s she blushing…? <br /> <br />“I want to get through school life without making waves. I don’t want to associate with troublemakers… Look for other to make friends.” <br /> <br />My words came out a bit cold, but that was half the reason for turning her down.  <br /> <br />The other half was that if she still hadn’t blended in with the class herself, this wasn’t the time for her to be hanging around me. <br /> <br />On top of my usual bad luck, right now I was burdened with these unpredictable mental choice options. No telling what weird things I might end up doing. If I stayed near someone like that, even Mihaneya might get treated like a weirdo and have trouble making other friends. <br /> <br />“I’ll figure it out on my own. It’d be better for Mihaneya to get into Suzuki’s group. They seem like they like teasing people, but I’m sure they’re good kids.” <br /> <br />“T-That may be true, but—” <br /> <br />“Sorry.” <br /> <br />I turned my back on her and started to walk away— <br /> <br />Thud! <br /> <br />“Ow ow owwww!” <br /> <br />I’d smashed my pinky into the leg of a chair as hard as I could. <br /> <br />“Ahahaha! Did you see that!? That’s divine retribution for not humbly accepting another’s good will! Ahahaha!”  <br /> <br />Hey, don’t look so happy about it… <br /> <br />“N-No…this wasn’t karma or anything, it’s just because of my constitution…”  <br /> <br />“Constitution?” <br /> <br />“Yeah…you see…” <br /> <br />I explained to Mihaneya how unlucky I’d been throughout my life up to now. <br /> <br />“I-I can’t believe someone with such awful luck exists…” <br /> <br />“Yeah…but it’s the plain truth. I want our classmates to know about it too so they understand the trouble I might cause, but for some reason it hasn’t come up yet…” <br /> <br />“I see… So that thing earlier about [accidentally wearing your mom’s panties to school] was because of your bad luck too?” <br /> <br />“No, that was a separate issue.” <br /> <br />“Separate issue?” <br /> <br />“Yeah, there’s an even more unbelievable story about my brain—” Guaaaaaah! <br /> <br />“W-What’s wrong!?” <br /> <br />“N-Nothing…I’m fine…” <br /> <br />Ng…I started getting a sudden headache when I tried to mention the mental choices… So I’m not allowed to talk about them openly, huh. <br /> <br />“A-Are you okay? You looked like you were in pain when you introduced yourself too… Do you have some kind of medical condition?” <br /> <br />“No, it’s not that, it’s—” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose ] <br /> </p>


<ol>
<li>[Calm down… Calm down my right hand!] and grope Getsuka Mihaneya’s chest. <br /> </li>



<li>[Calm down… Calm down my right hand!] and grope Youta Ootomo’s chest. </li>
</ol>



<p></p>



<p></p>



<p>“Both of those just make me seem like a perv!” <br /> <br />…But I have to follow through on the choice now that it’s out there. <br /> <br />Half-crazed, I aggressively groped my own boobs.  <br /> <br />“Calm down… Calm down my right hand!” <br /> <br />“What is that, some kind of new-age chuunibyou nonsense!?” <br /> <br />“That’s what I want to know!” <br /> <br />See, this is how it always ends up… Mihaneya definitely isn’t someone who should be my friend.  <br /> <br />“You get it now, Mihaneya. Hang around me and you’ll have to deal with crap like this.” <br /> <br />“Oh, that doesn’t bother me. In fact, the more pathetic you are, the easier it will be for me to establish dominance, so it’s ideal.” <br /> <br />That cheerful vileness… <br /> <br />“As a sign of our friendship, how about I start by calling you a nickname? Let’s see… Yes, how about Daikyo-san (Big Misfortune)?” <br /> <br />“D-Daikyo?” <br /> <br />“That’s right. Daikyo is the on’yomi reading of Youta. Fufun, it’s the perfect name for a walking calamity like you.” <br /> <br />“You little… If I do the same to your name Mihaneya wouldn’t it become Oobaka (big-idiot)!?” <br /> <br />“O- Obaka… H-How dare you make fun of my distinguished family name! Stop that!” <br /> <br />“Then Gesuka (trash flower).”  <br /> <br />“Gesuka!?” <br /> <br />“Say it fast like [Oobaka-Gesuka].” <br /> <br />“Please stop making me sound like some crappy comedy duo!” <br /> <br />“Hey, you started it with Daikyo. I’ll stop if you do.”  <br /> <br />“Fufun, no deal. I want to establish dominance, so I won’t stop. Only Daikyo-san has to stop.” <br /> <br />“You’ve really got a nasty personality, huh…” <br /> <br />“Ehehe.”  <br /> <br />“No, I mean, I’m not really complimenting you…” <br /> <br />“Anyway, is it okay in this day and age to call a girl things like ‘idiot’ and ‘nasty’? You’re gonna get some serious side-eye, you know?” <br /> <br />Ugh… that’s true. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“Alright, then how about ‘Ohana’?” <br /> <br />“Ohana?” <br /> <br />“Yeah. Combining the first and last part of ‘O-ha-na’ from the Mihaneya family name, it becomes ‘Ohana.’ That should be fine, right?” <br /> <br />“Wow, that’s cute!” <br /> <br />“Idiot… You’re getting all happy without even knowing it’s a reference to ‘flower’ in your head.”<br /><em>T/N: He’s calling her idiot, also I hate kanji wordplay joke </em><br /> <br />“It’s not cute at all!” <br /> <br />“Well, I can’t help it. My inner voice just slipped out…” <br /> <br />For some reason, looking at this person makes me want to tease her, or something… I feel like I can relate to Suzuki a little now. <br /> <br />“Wow, you two became really friendly in no time.” <br /> <br />Suzuki appeared at just the right time. <br /> <br />“No, no, we’re not getting friendly at all. Listen to this, Suzuki-san. This person called me terrible names like—” <br /> <br />“Oh, that’s Mihaneya-chan’s fault.” <br /> <br />“I haven’t said anything yet!” <br /> <br />Ohana excitedly explained to Suzuki about my unlucky nature and the conversation we had earlier. <br /> <br />“Ah, that’s Getsuka’s fault.” <br /> <br />I haven’t said anything yet!? <br /> <br />“No no, thinking about it, originally calling me Daikyou is much ruder… But it doesn’t seem like something Getsuka would do. Even though we’ve only known each other for a short time, you don’t seem like the kind of person who would make fun of someone’s traits, right?” <br /> <br />“Hah, it seems Suzuki-san is strangely biased. I’ve been saying I’m a genuine delinquent from the start. I just wanted to diss Daikyou-san 100%.” <br /> <br />“Ah, I see. You were worried that Ootomo-kun couldn’t let his classmates know about his bad luck trait, so you tried to help by giving him a nickname that conveyed it soundly, but you immediately regretted it yourself, and just as you were about to reflect on it, Ootomo-kun countered with ‘Oobaka’ and ‘Gesuka’, so you couldn’t back down, right?” <br /> <br />“Please stop perfectly guessing my line of thought!” <br /> <br />Bulls eye. <br /> <br />“So Ootomo-kun, forgive her. Getsuka has a good nature underneath but is just acting badly.” <br /> <br />“Your words can be too harsh!” <br /> <br />“Now now, Getsuka. Don’t you have something you want to say to Ootomo-kun?” <br /> <br />“Uuu…sorry…” <br /> <br />Sincere, huh. <br /> <br />“Nah, I was being shortsighted too. Most of the fault is not that Getsuka couldn’t blend in, but rather that there aren’t many people he can get along with.” <br /> <br />“No, I’m in the wrong. You’ve probably faced unpleasant things from a young age because of bad luck, and I said something making fun of that…” <br /> <br />Serious, huh. <br /> <br />Also, bad luck has basically become part of my life, so it’s not really that delicate of a topic…but even if I explained that normally, she would probably think it was a lie with how down she seems. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Ohana.” <br /> <br />“Hm?” <br /> <br />“From now on, I’m going to call you that – Ohana-chan from the Flower Fields.” <br /> <br />“Wh, why you…then I’ll call you Daikyou-san!” <br /> <br />“Go ahead. Also, I really don’t care about bad luck stuff anymore.” <br /> <br />“Hmph, I don’t feel anything about being called Flower Fields anymore either!” <br /> <br />You should feel something about it, I think. <br /> <br />In a voice low enough that Ohana couldn’t hear, Suzuki whispered. <br /> <br />“Heh, you’re kind, Daikyou-kun.” <br /> <br />“…Whatever.” <br /> <br />“It’s not that Getsuka couldn’t blend in so much as there just aren’t many people like Ootomo-kun can click with. You seem like a great match.” <br /> <br />“Stop it…” <br /> <br />“Hold on a second. What are you two whispering about?” <br /> <br />“Ah, it’s nothing. Just badmouthing Getsuka as usual.” <br /> <br />“You must be talking about something!” <br /> <br />“Ahaha, joke joke.” <br /> <br />“Oh, by the way Daikyou-san. I realized. The real reason you suddenly started calling me Ohana just now…” <br /> <br />…Well yeah, that makes sense. It would be a bit embarrassing if the person noticed the reason you were trying to spare their feelings, but there’s no helping it. <br /> <br />“Actually, you really liked the name ‘Daikyou-san’, right? But you were too embarrassed to directly ask me to call you that, so you intentionally provoked me a bit and tried to naturally work it into conversation…” How about it? <br /> <br />Hmm…? <br /> <br />“You weren’t bothered by bad luck teasing after all, and I went and apologized pointlessly. Ah, it’s not fair if it’s just me, so please apologize for ever calling me stupid or rude too…Come on!” <br /> <br />What the… <br /> <br />As I involuntarily looked at Suzuki, our eyes met with her expression saying [“What the…”]. <br /> <br />“…Ootomo-kun, you understand my feelings, right?” <br /> <br />“…Yes, very well.” <br /> <br />Watching the appearance of Mihaneya Getsuka, a girl taking advantage of the situation… <br /> <br />“”I want to smash her to bits”” <br /> <br />“What kind of thing are you muttering!?”</p>

<p>Right after Suzuki headed back to her group, Mihaneya came up to me brimming with excitement. <br /> <br />“Okay, okay, Daikyo-san! Hurry up and do something weird to make yourself even less popular!”  <br /> <br />“You’re the worst…” <br /> <br />“Did you forget? Half the reason I offered to be your friend was [because I want to establish dominance over someone lower than me], remember?” <br /> <br />How can she say something so nasty with that smug look…? <br /> <br />“So this officially bumps me up from worst in the grade. Be happy for me. Daikyo-san, you get to witness a historic moment.” <br /> <br />“What’s with the dramatic phrasing…? And moving up from the very bottom doesn’t really change anything.” <br /> <br />“No, it changes everything! This is the first step toward my dream!”  <br /> <br />“Dream?” <br /> <br />Mihaneya’s eyes lit up as she instantly replied. <br /> <br />“Yes! Becoming a superstar!” <br /> <br />“Huh!?” <br /> <br />I couldn’t help reacting.  <br /> <br />That word unavoidably makes me think of my dad. <br /> <br />“A superstar, huh. Specifically what kind?” <br /> <br />“The specifics don’t matter! A superstar is a superstar!” <br /> <br />“Come on, there are different kinds. Movie actor, pro athlete, singer…these days it could be an internet streamer or something.” <br /> <br />“Tsk tsk. You don’t get it at all. A true superstar transcends genre…they’re a concept at that point!” <br /> <br />…I don’t really get it, but one thing is clear: this girl is an idiot.  <br /> <br />“So what do you want to achieve by becoming a superstar?” <br /> <br />“I want to stand out and be doted on!” <br /> <br />“…And?” <br /> <br />“Huh? …And? That’s all there is to it!”  <br /> <br />“There’s gotta be more, right? Filling stadiums, walking red carpets, winning a pile of Olympic gold medals…” <br /> <br />“Oh, any of those would be fine! I just want to be doted on!” <br /> <br />This is just too stupid…but— <br /> <br />“That’s awesome.”  <br /> <br />“Huh? What’s so awesome about it? I usually just get laughed at when I tell people this dream…” <br /> <br />“No, the contents and motivation might be a little suspect, but that’s not a big issue. It’s just, being able to instantly reply—and with such a happy look—when asked about your dream, that’s really rare, you know?” <br /> <br />“Huh? …What’s with the sudden praise? I won’t fall for it just because you compliment me… Although, I guess you can grope my boobs for like 5 seconds if you want.” <br /> <br />She seems super excited… <br /> <br />“Nah, it just made me feel lame about myself. My life’s goal is [to live peacefully without standing out]… Our aspirations have totally different scales, huh?” <br /> <br />“What’s wrong with that?” <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“Just now, when you talked about your goal, your eyes were serious. I could tell you really want that. I don’t think the scale matters when it comes to finding meaning in life.”  <br /> <br />“O-ohana…” <br /> <br />“Yes!” <br /> <br />“Then again, we shouldn’t be friends after all.” <br /> <br />“How is that a logical progression!?” <br /> <br />“No, it makes total sense… Because your dream is to become a superstar, right? Whether you succeed or fail, you’re guaranteed to attract a ton of attention…directly opposed to my goal of not standing out at all. You understood that I was serious about not wanting to stand out, right?” <br /> <br />“That was a lie! I don’t understand at all how [not wanting to stand out] could be a goal! I just pretended to understand so you’d be charmed by me and I could establish dominance!  <br /> <br />This girl really… Well, her blurting all that out shows she’s mischievous rather than malicious.  <br /> <br />“And you know, Daikyo-san, isn’t your thinking a bit shallow?” <br /> <br />“What do you mean by that?” <br /> <br />“You know, the closer I get to becoming a superstar – the more fame I gain – the more invisible you’ll become next to me… See, you’re already being called the ‘other guy’ on TV.”  <br /> <br />“Yeah, it’s true… In comedy duos where one partner has a really strong personality or character, the other one often gets stuck with an unflattering nickname like that… If you insist on staying next to someone flashy, you’ll remain unnoticed yourself… Maybe that’s an unconventional way of thinking about it.” <br /> <br />“I get it… Let’s put this on hold for now.” <br /> <br />“Phew… I managed to ramble something plausible together. You’re pretty easygoing, aren’t you?”  <br /> <br />Don’t say that out loud… <br /> <br />“Well, that’s what my dream is, so this historic moment I mentioned earlier isn’t an exaggeration at all. I’m going to become a member of Teio Ten Sai from now on.” <br /> <br />“You serious? That’s not just any Ten either…” <br /> <br />“Yes, and not just some run-of-the-mill member! I’m going to defeat all the current ten and take that spot solely for myself! By this time next year, the name Mihaneya Getsuka will be echoing across the nation as Teio One!”  <br /> <br />“Each one is the absolute pinnacle in the country though? You think you can do that?” <br /> <br />“Because I’m a superstar.” <br /> <br />Mihaneya smiled confidently.  <br /> <br />“Yet your immediate goal is just to escape last place? Seems like a tiny first step for such lofty ambitions.” <br /> <br />“Urgh… Y-You and your smart mouth again…” <br /> <br />Mihaneya made an exaggerated struggling gesture, as if pondering something. <br /> <br />“Fine. Let’s move up the timeline then… Look over there.” <br /> <br />She nodded towards the center of the classroom.  <br /> <br />A conspicuous group was gathered there, chatting amongst themselves. <br /> <br />And one girl with brown hair stood out even among them – the student I had noticed this morning. <br /> <br />“Reina Houjou – the only daughter of the Houjou Group.” <br /> <br />“Huh? …The Houjou Group as in that Houjou?” <br /> <br />“Yes. That Houjou.” </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>The Houjou Holdings – a massive corporation that any Japanese person would know the name of.  <br /> <br />With roots spread through finance, food, construction and every other field imaginable. <br /> <br />Especially in clothing with their lingerie brand Mitera at the forefront, their dominance in the fashion industry is unmatched. <br /> <br />There’s hardly anyone who hasn’t heard their slogan “Anytime, Anywhere, Anyone.”  <br /> <br />“Not only is her lineage top-notch, she herself is extremely talented too. You can see how she looks. And her grades are top of the class here at Teio Academy. She also shows extraordinary athletic ability, and won the gold medal in the National Speech Contest last year.” <br /> <br />“Damn… her stats are off the charts… So she’s the real deal among The Teio Academy Ten Sai?” <br /> <br />“No, for Houjou they gave a separate title – ‘The Unmatched Eleventh One’.”  <br /> <br />“The Unmatched Eleven? Kinda sounds chuuni but also amazing.” <br /> <br />“No, it’s not like that… It implies a level far removed from the students ranked twelfth and below – no matter how hard she tried, she could never join the Ten – that sort of dishonorable connotation.”  <br /> <br />For real… Just how good are the current Ten… <br /> <br />“Nevertheless, it’s undeniable that Houjou reigns supreme over the social hierarchy in this class. As a preliminary match before taking on the Ten, I’ll first topple her.” <br /> <br />Mihaneya smiled wickedly. <br /> <br />“I’m going to challenge Houjou to a debate right now. If I thoroughly defeat her on her home turf, she’ll lose her influence and have to cede her spot to me.” <br /> <br />“But she won the national gold right? What chance do you have against someone like that?” <br /> <br />“Because I’m a superstar.” <br /> <br />With that seemingly irrelevant reply, Mihaneya strode confidently over to Houjou’s group.  <br /> <br />She spoke to Houjou, they exchanged some words, then Mihaneya came back here – <br /> <br />“Uwah…uwah…” And burst into tears. <br /> <br />“The hell, she made you bawl already!?” <br /> <br />“I-It’s just…just…she’s so m-mean… At first we were just debating normally but… Once I realized I was going to lose, I kept calling her ‘Stupid Houjou’ and ‘Idiot Houjou’…and she got really scary…” <br /> <br />That’s clearly your fault though… <br /> <br />“Dai-chan, please go over.” <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“If you can beat Houjou, you’ll be ranked eleventh. Then after that, I just have to go chomp chomp on you and I’ll be eleventh! It’s perfect.” <br /> <br />Why does she think it’ll be easy to beat me… <br /> <br />“First off, there’s no way I can beat Houjou. And more importantly, don’t make a scene that attracts attent–” </p>

<p>“No freaking way I’m doing either of those!” <br /> <br />…Wait. Despite my initial reaction to the absurdity of option 2, option 1 seems quite reasonable in comparison. Especially after the previous choices of [Absolutely Do Not Want] or [Absolutely Cannot Do], having a slightly more palatable option feels welcome.  <br /> <br />I’m probably numb to how bad these are, but if I have to do something anyway, better it be less awful. <br /> <br />“Fine, I’ll go do it.” <br /> <br />“Eh, you’re really gonna go, Dai-chan?” <br /> <br />“Well, you did tell me to do it…” <br /> <br />“I-I was joking, joking… There’s no way someone pathetic like you could handle her either, but getting in over your head challenging her to proper matches might genuinely get you dealt with around here.” <br /> <br />Huh? …She serious? However powerful the Houjou are, it’s a bit fantastical for them to wield that much influence… But Mihaneya seems genuinely concerned. <br /> <br />“Urgh…”  <br /> <br />── But with this headache of a demand hanging over my head, I had no choice but to do it. <br /> <br />“Ohana… There are times when a man has to step up.” <br /> <br />“I think this is definitely not the time…” <br /> <br />I agree… <br /> <br />I pressed my aching head and approached the group of chattering students.  <br /> <br />Just as I was about to call out to Houjou, who was at the center of it all… <br /> <br />“Wait a minute. What business do you have with Reina-sama?” <br /> <br />One of the attendants, who had an unmistakable air of an upper-class young lady, glared at me intensely. Reina [sama]? Seriously… <br /> <br />“No, there’s no need to ask for the purpose. Please take your leave.” <br /> <br />Another attendant directed a cold gaze at me. <br /> <br />“We can’t allow such a dangerous individual to approach Reina-sama.” <br /> <br />“No, it’s all a misunderstanding, my various eccentricities…” <br /> <br />“Moreover, your indecent behavior earlier is irrelevant. Don’t think that just any ordinary boy can casually approach Reina-sama.” <br /> <br />Uh-oh… This is serious. They’re not joking; they’re dead serious. <br /> <br />It’s not even about social hierarchies anymore; it seems like Houjou has established an ironclad regime within this class. <br /> <br />“Guh…” <br /> <br />My headache seemed to urge me to hurry. I didn’t want to flop around again, but I couldn’t just leave. <br /> <br />“Houjou!” <br /> <br />Ignoring the piercing stares of the attendants, I forcefully called out to the person at the center of it all. <br /> <br />” …… Apparently, the Japanese language doesn’t work for you.” <br /> <br />They all simultaneously stood up, exuding an intimidating aura. <br /> <br />Uh… Th-This is bad… <br /> <br />“S-Sit down! Forget about it!” <br /> <br />With a sudden remark, their movements came to a halt. <br /> <br />The one who spoke, Reina Houjou, looked at me with a bored expression. <br /> <br />“…So?” <br /> <br />Uh, scary… A single word, and cold sweat trickled down my forehead. <br /> <br />“Well, sorry, but… Can you have a debate with me for a moment?” <br /> <br />“Huh? …Why?” <br /> <br />W-Why, indeed?! <br /> <br />Wh-What is this audacity… This is definitely not something a high school girl should have.  <br /> <br />Just from that, her gaze alone could kill someone, and her voice was absolute zero, not to mention the overwhelming pressure she exuded through her presence.</p>



<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://i.postimg.cc/8Cj3jBQ4/00023.jpg" alt="" /></div></figure>

<p>These can’t just be skills she acquired. They’re the innate qualities of someone born to rule… Come on, saying she can’t make the Ten must be a joke… <br /> <br />“U-Um, why…I mean, I wanted to experience your gold medal debating skill firsthand…or something like that…”  <br /> <br />Squirming pathetically under Houjou’s overwhelming pressure, I’m tripping over my words. <br /> <br />“No thanks. Waste of time.”  <br /> <br />…Well duh. <br /> <br />But her reaction works for me.  <br /> <br />The objective according to the choice was simply to [Challenge] her. The moment I proposed a match, the choice prompt in my head disappeared cleanly. <br /> <br />“How long you gonna stand there? Hurry up and scram.” <br /> <br />“Y-Yes ma’am!” <br /> <br />My voice goes completely squeaky. No, she’s seriously terrifying… I’m so glad she turned down the match… With a profound sense of relief, I turn my back on Houjou. <br /> <br />“What’s with everyone today anyway? First that incompetent, now this pervert. The earlier one was desperate enough that I humored her with a match, but he’s not even worth talking to.” <br /> <br />“It’s only natural. No one can compete with your logical reasoning, Reina.”  <br /> <br />“That’s right. Even though the speech contest wasn’t head-to-head, you were so overwhelmingly skilled. Just remembering makes me swoon.” <br /> <br />“Haah. And that incompetent is too much of a small fry to be at Teio Academy.”  <br /> <br />“The chairman is known for her eccentricity. As long as someone specializes in one thing, she accepts them readily regardless of everything else… But even I have to agree that guy doesn’t make the cut.” <br /> <br />“I concur. Such vulgar riffraff has no business being in Reina’s sight.”  <br /> <br />“Right? We should use your family’s influence to do something. Maybe get him expelled?” <br /> <br />“Don’t kid yourself. Using the family over trash like that would make us the laughingstock.”  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Oh, that guy…” <br /> <br />It was unforgivable trash talk – though they weren’t yelling, I was still close enough to hear it all clearly. <br /> <br />“I-It’s okay, Dai-chan!”  <br /> <br />At that point, Mihaneya tugged urgently on my sleeve.  <br /> <br />“Just ignore stuff like that. Picking a real fight and incurring her wrath could genuinely get you dealt with around here.” <br /> <br />“I was wondering earlier too… Is the Houjou influence for real that powerful?” <br /> <br />“Yes. I heard they make huge donations here too… It wouldn’t be strange if they could interfere with management or personnel. And also–” <br /> <br />“And also?” <br /> <br />“Aside from family power, do you feel you could win an argument against her? ”  <br /> <br />” …… I don’t think so. <br /> <br />“Right? I’m still shaking over here… so don’t worry about it.”  <br /> <br />“Well, if you say so–” <br /> <br />“By the way, didn’t you say something weird earlier? Not just spouting nonsense about taking down the Ten Sai, but becoming a superstar in the future too.”  <br /> <br />“Yeah. My ears couldn’t believe such a mediocre flunky saying something so delusional and sparkly-eyed.” <br /> <br />“Quite right. I was astonished she could declare such things when someone as perfect as Reina is aiming for the top.” <br /> <br />“Hey, cut it out. There’s no way I wanna be some cringey thing like that.”  <br /> <br />“My apologies. I shouldn’t have compared you to such a Showa relic.” <br /> <br />“Haah… And you know, I think it’s pretty embarrassing for high schoolers nowadays to still have dreams and stuff. When you sparkle your eyes and talk all passionat– <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“…Hey.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Huh? What do you want, you flunky transfer student? I told you to scram.” <br /> <br />“Don’t laugh at people’s dreams.” </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>It wasn’t a conscious decision but a reflex. <br /> <br />“…Hah?” <br /> <br />Houjou shot me a gaze bordering on murderous. <br /> <br />Yet none of the fear from before came. <br /> <br />I don’t have any dreams. <br /> <br />While I do have the goal of living inconspicuously, it’s a passive desire to avoid standing out rather than actively wanting something. <br /> <br />And so she seemed dazzling. <br /> <br />That girl Mihaneya, talking about her dreams, looked radiant. <br /> <br />I only just met her, there’s no reason for me to butt in like this. <br /> <br />If anything, it’s unnecessary meddling. <br /> <br />But instinct, not reason, compelled me. <br /> <br />Silence this girl, it said. <br /> <br />“You have no right to laugh at Mihaneya’s dreams.”  <br /> <br />“Haah? Who the hell… You have no right to obstruct my freedom of speech either.” <br /> <br />“Is that how you won the gold medal in the speech contest? By mocking others?” <br /> <br />“…You wanna die?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Hey, something’s getting tense over there… What’s going on?” <br /> <br />“It looks like the transfer student is picking a fight with Houjou-san.” <br /> <br />“That’s reckless…” <br /> <br />“It’s over… Even among the Ten Sai, there’s only one person who can challenge Houjou in terms of debate…” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Duel me, Houjou. And when I win, apologize to Oohana–to Getsuka.” <br /> <br />“Fine. I’ll humor you however many times you want–but what if you lose?” <br /> <br />“Anything. You decide.”  <br /> <br />“Nice. Then become my slave–be prepared to lose your human dignity.” <br /> <br />Houjou grinned ferociously.  <br /> <br />“So how will we compete? I’ll allow anything as long as it’s fair.” <br /> <br />“Debate is fine.” <br /> <br />“…Hah?”  <br /> <br />A vein bulges on Houjou’s temple. <br /> <br />“Are you looking down on me?” <br /> <br />Objectively, it is suicidal. <br /> <br />But I wasn’t rational in that moment.  <br /> <br />I wanted to crush her in her area of expertise… That’s what I felt. <br /> <br />“You should be thinking up excuses for when you lose instead of worrying about others. You’re good at blabbing, after all.” <br /> <br />“…Bring it on then.”  <br /> <br />Houjou’s tone becomes lower, clearly entering battle mode. <br /> <br />“But as is, it’s too slanted in my favor to be interesting. I’ll at least let you pick the topic. Not that it’ll help even a bit.” <br /> <br />Although I swore to defeat her on her home turf, there’s no need to concede ground on the actual content. This is where I need to gain any advantage I can with the theme– <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />【Choose] <br /> <br />① Debate whether it is [OK] or [Not OK] to wear your mom’s panties to school. <br /> <br />② Debate whether it is [OK] or [Not OK] to wear your mom’s panties on your head at school. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“You’ve got no sense of appropriate time and place!!!!!!!!!”  <br /> <br />Seriously, think about appropriate time and place! This was a super serious scene just now! <br /> <br />“You’re the one with no reading the air, suddenly shouting like that. Hurry up and decide.” <br /> <br />Ah, too stupid…………The sheer stupidity of the choices defused my anger, and my rage-filled mind unexpectedly calmed down– <br /> <br />………………………………………………………………………… What the hell am I doing… <br /> <br />This is really standing out…extremely standing out! <br /> <br />Oh crap, I’ve done it now!  <br /> <br />Picking a fight with the class queen…and the daughter of the Houjou family no less. This is absurdly over the line! <br /> <br />“Um, Houjou…”  <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“Can we call off this match…?” <br /> <br />“No way in hell.” <br /> <br />…Well yeah. <br /> <br />“Urgh!”  <br /> <br />As if to drive it home, the urging headache… Ah, I have to choose. <br /> <br />“W-Whether it’s okay or not to wear your mom’s panties to school…” <br /> <br />“……………………So. You’re looking down on me that much huh.” <br /> <br />No, the one looking down is the weird choices in my head…wait, that’s still me in the end. <br /> <br />“To insist I’m on the ‘it’s okay’ side with this theme, against this Houjou Reina…it’s nothing but humiliation.”  <br /> <br />“Ah, no wait, I’m on the ‘not okay’ si–” <br /> <br />“Sakuraba! You’re on the broadcast committee right? Mind refereeing this for us?” <br /> <br />“Y-Yes ma’am!” <br /> <br />Houjou decides herself that she’s on the ‘not okay’ side, and unilaterally starts preparations. Well duh…it makes no sense for me to argue wearing my own mom’s panties is okay when I’m on the ‘not okay’ side… Not that I actually wore them! Just said it, didn’t actually wear them! And I should clarify that misunderstanding too, before debating as if I’m on the ‘okay’ si–…urgh, impossible. <br /> <br />“We will now begin the debate match between Houjou vs Transfer Student !” <br /> <br />While I’m still thinking, the appointed referee Sakuraba, true to his broadcast committee background, fluently announces the start of the match. <br /> <br />“Today’s theme is: ‘Is it okay or not to wear your mother’s panties to school?’ Houjou will take the ‘not okay’ side, Ootomo will take the ‘okay’ side! Please debate based on those positions!” <br /> <br />“I reeeally wanna back out now…”<br />“Ah…how badly does he wanna insist it’s okay to wear mom’s panties?”<br />“This guy’s either a huge idiot or a total psycho!”<br />“Nah, definitely just an idiot…”<br />“Well the theme’s crazy but getting to hear Houjou debate is lucky, right?”<br />“Yeah! I’ll cheer you on super hard!” <br /> <br />This is bad…already clearly favoring Houjou from the start…but that’s a given based on these circumstances… Gotta somehow turn it around with logic here! <br /> <br />“Okay, first Ootomo, please state your grounds for believing wearing your mother’s panties to school is okay!” <br /> <br />Hey c’mon… <br /> <br />“…………” <br /> <br />“Whoops! A shocking silent treatment in this debate venue! We’ll take this as forfeiting your turn, and move to Houjou’s side. Please tell us why it is not okay!” <br /> <br />“First, familial relations or not, sharing underwear is inconceivable from a hygienic perspective. It would be foolish to underestimate the risk of transmitting disease. Second, men and women’s underwear serve entirely different purposes by design. Even if hypothetically he and his mother share the same height and weight, there would be discrepancies in their bone structure and body shapes, making for poor fit. To maximize functionality one should wear undergarments suited to their sex. Third, even if we yield that wearing them is a personal freedom, promoting that fact loudly makes no sense. One should refrain from disruptive speech and conduct in an educational institution. And fourth, it is just physically disgusting.”  <br /> <br />“W-Wow, a merciless four-hit combo! Ootomo, do you have any rebuttals?” <br /> <br />Hey c’mon… <br /> <br />“…………” <br /> <br />“O-Once again just silence! At this point it’s unreasonable to not consider this forfeiting, Ootomo!” <br /> <br />No, what do you want me to… Houjou’s too strong! <br /> <br />To think up and organize all that in such a short span… And methodically pushing with logic before ending on a blunt emotional appeal. She’s not just some debating bookworm, but has the skill to draw in the hearts of her audience too… With that, there’s no chance of winning this. <br /> <br />“Hey…if you got no will to fight then hurry up and submit to being my slave.” <br /> <br />Ugh…Houjou glares at me, eyes filled with killing intent. And livestock…well, I get what’ll happen if I lose. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose ] <br /> <br />① Admit defeat, praise each other’s efforts, and request swapping uniforms.  <br /> <br />② Refuse to admit defeat, and make an inspiring final statement. <em>Pose submissively face-up</em> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Both are completely insane! <br /> <br />…But going with 1 means immediate slavery, so– <br /> <br />“Surrender…? Don’t kid yourself. The one who’ll be howling in defeat in a few minutes is you, Houjou.” <br /> <br />I passionately declare this while posing face-up like an overturned turtle. <br /> <br />“Dude’s seriously screwed…”<br />“This guy’s a goddamn nutjob…”<br />“Why’s he making that smug face while posing like that?”<br />“Man, I’d wanna die if I were him…” <br /> <br />Don’t worry, I wanna die too. <br /> <br />“Whoa! An extremely bizarre taunt plays out here! Does this suggest you have some secret plan for a reversal, Ootomo?!”  <br /> <br />Hey c’mon… <br /> <br />“…Cut the crap already.”  <br /> <br />Houjou glares down at me, seething with icy rage. <br /> <br />“Keep joking around…and I’ll stomp you into the ground.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />【Choose] <br /> <br />① “Please!”</p>

<p><strong>② “PLEASE!!!!”</strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Nothing but the loudness changed! No meaning in this choice at all anymore! <br /> <br />You’re not actually gonna…there’s no way you’d really… Please! <br /> <br />“P-Please!” <br /> <br />“Oh…then I’ll grant your wish.” <br /> <br />Crapcrapcrap that’s a real scary look…! …Gotta hurry and get up! <br /> <br /> <br /> </p>



<p>【Choose ] <br /> <br />① Don’t stop posing submissively until the outcome is decided.</p>



<p>② Be naked until the outcome is decided. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />2 just means full nakedness!  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“S-Stop, Houjou! This is a debate! Violence is against the rules!” <br /> <br />“You’re the one who told me to stomp you, what the hell’s wrong with your brain?!” <br /> <br />…An excellent point. <br /> <br />“And hurry up and stand already. How long you gonna stay in that babyish pose?” <br /> <br />…Having chosen 1, I can’t stop posing until the outcome is decided.  <br /> <br />Gotta keep this debate going like this– <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />【Choose ] <br /> <br />① “Houjou, I’ll prove your underwear is worse than mine!”</p>



<p>② “Houjou, take off my underwear!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Way too random! Is the choice prompt getting tired of thinking too?! <br /> <br />Ugh…as much as it pains me, guess I’ve got no choice but to rile her up again. <br /> <br />I’ll just quickly pick 1 and– <br /> <br /><em>Boop</em>  <br /> <br />Suddenly I hear a fluttering sound as a small fly lands on the tip of my nose. <br /> <br />“Ha…ha…ha…ha-choo!” <br /> <br />At a time like this–well, sneezing kinda feels like it resets my head. <br /> <br />“Houjou, take off my diaper!” <br /> <br />………Huh? <br /> <br />What did I just…say…? <br /> <br />Crapcrapcrap picked the wrong one after the reset ahhhhhhhhhh! <br /> <br />I-I mean it’s completely my mistake, but if that stupid fly hadn’t come I would’ve picked the less awful option ①.. D-Damn…piled on my already near-zero luck…! <br /> <br />“Dude…this is seriously bad.”<br />“Ah…not satisfied with mom’s panties, he’s wearing diapers too now…”<br />“Next-level pervert here…”<br />“Yeah, this is genuinely gross…” <br /> <br />Oh, I’m done for… This is irreversible. <br /> <br />With that going beyond just a gag and being genuinely offensive…there’s no recovering my reputation in this classroom.  <br /> <br />And with my image this ruined, the already tiny chance of winning the debate is completely gone too… No logic I cobble together will get anyone to listen now. </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Which means it’s decided I’ll be Houjou’s slave…and simultaneously, I’ve failed to make her apologize to Mihaneya… Dammit…! <br /> <br />“…………” <br /> <br />Despite the outcome already being decided, perhaps due to my excessively crude remark, Houjou stares vacantly into space, stunned.  <br /> <br />“…………No way.” <br /> <br />Hm? …Something seems off? <br /> <br />“It’s a lie…right? But it being by chance is even more…impossible.”  <br /> <br />Muttering something, Houjou rakes her hair with her hands and turns her gaze to me. <br /> <br />“You did it…Ootomo Youta!” <br /> <br />“Huh? …Did what?” <br /> <br />“Oh…playing dumb huh.” <br /> <br />What is Houjou talking about? <br /> <br />“W-What do you mean, Houjou?” <br /> <br />Sakuraba makes the same confused expression as me and questions Houjou. <br /> <br />“You know Mitera, the flagship of my family’s Houjou apparel division?” <br /> <br />“Um, yes…you guys bombard us with CMs and stuff, even I as a guy know about it. It’s the ‘anytime, anywhere, anyone’ thing right?” <br /> <br />“That’s right. That phrase has been broadcast for over half a century, permeating the Japanese public. We want it worn anytime, anywhere, by any woman…that was the feeling put into it…but recently, the ‘anyone’ part got an update.”  <br /> <br />“Uhh…what kind of update?” <br /> <br />“Venturing into men’s underwear – riding the recent gender-free wave, Mitera pivoted in a new direction. Rather than launching a separate men’s sub-brand, selling men and women’s underwear equally under the Mitera name worked to achieve true ‘anyone’. Mitera men’s is still just starting with limited pre-sales, so most being unaware is natural.”  <br /> <br />“I-I see…but what does that have to do with this match?” <br /> <br />“Not many know the etymology, but…Mitera derives from the Greek for ‘mother’.”  <br /> <br />“Mother…Ah! No…way!” <br /> <br />“Yes…that ‘no way’.” <br /> <br />Seems others caught on, but I still don’t get it at all so please explain further. <br /> <br />“This man…Ootomo Youta, is right now undoubtedly wearing Mitera brand men’s underwear.”  <br /> <br />Huh? …Well I’ve got some 190 yen Donki panties with a shitty mascot called Furikake-kun on them, but… <br /> <br />“And he used the term ‘mother’s pants’ not in the literal sense of his own mother’s underwear, but as a metaphor for Mitera panties.” <br /> <br />No…I was going with my actual mom’s panties the whole time…  <br /> <br />“He then skillfully guided the situation into a debate match with me…even setting themes extremely disadvantageous to himself. Then once pushed to the brink, he would reveal that fact… As heir to the Houjou, I cannot refute Mitera panties and the ‘anytime, anywhere, anyone’ concept…I would have no choice but to acknowledge wearing ‘mother’s panties’ to school is okay – producing a brilliant reversal.”  <br /> <br />Sakuraba, looking somewhat uneasy, tentatively spoke to Houjou, who had a resentful expression. <br /> <br />“U-um, Houjou-san, don’t you think you’re overthinking this a bit…?” <br /> <br />I share the same sentiment. <br /> <br />“Too naive… Way too naive! I mean, if that weren’t the case, why would you declare that you were wearing your mother’s panties on your first day at a new school? That’s just completely insane!” <br /> <br />Well, yes, it is insane. These choices in my head are completely insane. <br /> <br />“Do you really think you would willingly strike such a humiliating pose? Or that you’d tell me to take off your diaper…? …Not by my own will, but deliberately making me take it off in front of you, just to reveal the truth at the most effective moment! That’s the only way to explain it! I’ll say it as many times as it takes, but if that’s not the case, then you’re completely insane!” <br /> <br />No… I’m being forced into completely insane actions… <br /> <br />“It was all… planned from the moment you entered the classroom. While playing the fool, secretly plotting to take me down, Reina Houjou, the top of this class.” <br /> <br />“W-what diabolical cunning… To choose such an extremely high-risk, high-reward option… Your courage is beyond half measures…” <br /> <br />No, it’s a high-risk, no-reward situation. <br /> <br />“I let my guard down… I thought you were just an idiot and underestimated you… I had information that Principal Ōgami had scouted you directly!” <br /> <br />” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” “? ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” ” <br /> <br />My classmates’ eyes widen in astonishment. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“What!? Ōgami-sensei…?” <br /> <br />“Yep… She’s rumored to only scout the very best for Ten Sai until now…” <br /> <br />Wait, this can’t be true… The reaction to just Principal Ōgami’s direct scout… Her influence in the school seems even greater than I imagined. And because she’s held in such reverence, everyone’s judgment is clouded. <br /> <br />Well, regardless of the reason, this works out well for me. It means I can push through this situation, right? Alright! Misunderstanding or not, as long as I can get through this, I’ll take anything– <br /> <br />“…But we’re not done yet! …What just happened was merely a deduction. I’m 99% certain, but I won’t give up until I’ve considered every 1% possibility. Ootomo, show it here. But of course, not everything. Just shift your jersey slightly and reveal a bit of the waistband of your underwear. If there’s a [Mitera] logo there… I’ll admit defeat.” <br /> <br />………………………Huh? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“U-uh, whoa! This is getting interesting!” <br /> <br />“What’s happening… What’s the real story?” <br /> <br />“Idiot, this is just a formal confirmation for Houjou-san to accept her loss. She even said it’s 99% certain herself.” <br /> <br />“That’s right… With Principal Ōgami’s seal of approval…” <br /> <br />“Yeah, it’s obvious that [Mitera]’s logo will come up and settle the matter!” <br /> <br />Wait, what…? When I lift my jersey, it’s revealing [Furikake-kun]… <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“””””Pull it down! Pull it down! Pull it down! Pull it down! Pull it down!””””” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />What do I do…? In the midst of all this excitement, if something different from everyone’s expectations comes up– <br /> <br />It’s the worst… I’ve lost all my dignity in this classroom. <br /> <br />There’s no way to turn things around from here… No, there is one way, and that’s the transcendent power of my brain choices. <br /> <br />With that power, I can create an ultra twist where my [Furikake-kun] panties magically transform into [Mitera]’s. <br /> <br />But such a convenient miracle happening is.</p>

<p>【Choose ] <br /> <br />① The underwear you’re wearing transforms into Soboro-chan from the “Meal Friends” series. <br /> <br />② The underwear you’re wearing transforms into Polo-chan from the “Tonight’s Friend” series.】 <br /> <br /> <br /> </p>



<p>Yeah, I was stupid for getting my hopes up! <br /> <br />Ugh…the premise of my underwear transforming was right but it’s still frustrating…though it doesn’t matter unless it becomes Mitera. <br /> <br />The moment I reluctantly select 1,  <br /> <br />“………… I felt a slight discomfort in the lower half of my body. <br /> <br />a slight discomfort comes from my lower body.  <br /> <br />Seems my Furikake-kun did change to Soboro-chan…so what’s the point? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“”””Tug it down! Tug it down! Tug it down! Tug it down! Tug it down!”””” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Oblivious to my lament, my expectant classmates continue their excited chant. <br /> <br />I can’t refuse this… Dammit…! <br /> <br />With agonized resignation, I grab the elastic of my jersey and tug it down. <br /> <br />In that instant– <br /> <br /><em>Ping!</em> <br /> <br />A pleasant ping rings out as something white comes flying through the window. <br /> <br />“Gaaaahhhh! ” <br /> <br />It impacts straight into the exposed upper line of my underwear. <br /> <br />Vrrrrrrrrrr! <br /> <br />“Oof!” <br /> <br />It must have been spinning fiercely as it gouges slightly into my underwear before finally dropping to the floor. <br /> <br />[S-Sorry! You okay?!] <br /> <br />The voice sounds the same as the one from the principal’s office this morning… Seems it was a home run ball from the baseball team practicing outside. <br /> <br />Unlucky…what’re the odds of this twice in one day… <br /> <br />“My my, what unlikely timing for happenings, but…”  <br /> <br />Unable to stop posing, Sakuraba returns the ball while taking over as emcee.  <br /> <br />“This is no time for that! Just what was Ootomo wearing– Huh?” <br /> <br />What was written there was the six characters for soboro…or rather, had been six characters.  <br /> <br />The earlier spinning seems to have gouged away the last two characters. It looks as if nothing had ever been there… Leaving four nonsensical characters, sobo, remaining. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“It’s not…Mitera?”<br />“Huh? What’s going on? Even Houjou was 99% sure…”<br />“He’s really just some pervert?”<br />“Doesn’t seem like mom’s panties either though.”<br />“No, he’s definitely got something weird on underneath.” <br /> <br /> <br /> </p>



<p>Oh no…it’s over… <br /> <br />My peaceful school life comes crashing down– <br /> <br />Thud. <br /> <br />“What the…hell…” <br /> <br />Houjou sinks to her knees. <br /> <br />………… Huh? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“N-No way… Just what is…this guy really…” <br /> <br />As everyone struggles to comprehend the situation, Houjou grabs her head and trembles violently.  <br /> <br />“Uh, what’s going on Houjou? Since it wasn’t the Mitera brand after all, it must have just been a coincidence with the same lettering right…?” <br /> <br />Sakuraba questions Houjou with the same confused expression as me.  <br /> <br />“Absolutely not. If anything, this is worse than I imagined!” <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“Look closely. What you see now is sobo… Convert that to kanji and what do you get?” <br /> <br />“Uh? …Ah…ahhhhhhhhhhh!?” <br /> <br />“Yes…[Grandmother]. He didn’t need to wear the Mitera men’s underwear to win. Dissatisfied with that, wearing the existence above Mitera – [Grandmother] – he produced an even more complete victory to flaunt being on a different level from you all!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Whaaaaaaat theeeeeeee helllllllllll!?” <br /> <br />Whaaaaaaat theeeeeeee helllllllllll!? <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“S-So he intentionally made some incomprehensible gesture? If Houjou hadn’t noticed, he would have explained it himself later for maximum impact…right? But that way the effect seems like it’d be diluted–” <br /> <br />“No…a true strategist incorporates their opponent’s intellect and personality into their plans. Him getting me to realize ‘mother’ = ‘Mitera’, coming up with the men’s Mitera, telling me to show the logo…he predicted it all, and…I completely danced in Ootomo Youta’s palm.” <br /> <br />“Th-That can’t be…incorporating even Houjou’s excellence…I can’t believe a high schooler is capable of that!” <br /> <br />It’s a lie so you shouldn’t believe it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“[Houjou’s excellence]…Heh…me saying that is also according to Ootomo Youta’s plans. With that devilish intellect, he could have beaten me in an even more humiliating way. But instead, he chose a defeat that allowed me to retain some dignity.”  <br /> <br />I think if you were truly excellent, you should have realized all your dialogue is mistaken much sooner. <br /> <br />“Faced with this dimensional difference, I don’t even feel anger at being shown pity…instead it’s a strangely refreshing feeling.” <br /> <br />Houjou looks straight at me and declares: <br /> <br />“Ootomo Youta…you have thoroughly defeated me.” <br /> <br />“Whaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaat!!?” <br /> <br />The classroom erupts into deafening cheers. <br /> <br />“Holy crap…just holy crap!”<br />“Seriously, what kind of brain structure does he have…?”<br />“I gotta hand it to Houjou, makes it seem like she was in the script too…”<br />“Coming in so antagonistically yet winning flawlessly without leaving any grudges…”<br />“The Ougami chosen children are terrifying!” <br /> <br />This is bad… I’m standing out…extremely standing out! While winning in the end is good but– <br /> <br />“Oh wait…” <br /> <br />That’s right. Whatever the process, I won in the end. Getting caught up in the absurd developments, I forgot why I ended up in this match to begin with. <br /> <br />Finally freed from the submissive pose, I stand and gaze at Houjou. <br /> <br />In response, she silently nods and walks over next to a certain person. <br /> <br />“Mihaneya Getsuka!” <br /> <br />“Eek!” <br /> <br />Facing Mihaneya who looks startled, Houjou– <br /> <br />“I’m sorry.” <br /> <br />Bows deeply.  <br /> <br />“For laughing at your dream.” <br /> <br />“Houjou-san. …… ” <br /> <br />“It may sound like an excuse but…I was frustrated with myself… No matter how many times I challenged, I couldn’t make it into the The Teio Academy Ten Sai… No, that’s not it. I was irritated at, deep down, already thinking it was hopeless. The Ten Sai were too strong and it broke my spirit. Though none would admit it openly, I believe that dishonorable title of ‘The Unmatched Eleventh One’ fits me more than anyone. But as a Houjou, I can’t show that attitude… Then you came along speaking so purely about defeating the Ten and becoming a superstar…I just snapped and said awful things…”  <br /> <br />“Ahaha, it’s okay. I know best how pathetic I am.” <br /> <br />“But I feel an unbreakable will in your eyes. Despite acknowledging your own weakness, you don’t give up on aiming higher… It’s something I could never have.” <br /> <br />“That’s not true, Houjou is amazing! You can challenge the Ten again and again from now on!” <br /> <br />“No…It’s because I realized I’ve given up that I was trying to salvage some pride being boss of this classroom. After continuing that for a year, my heart grew ugly and distorted, causing unpleasant feelings for the class… Although externally I still have to keep up the pretense of challenging as a Houjou, personally I’m…honestly…ready to quit.” <br /> <br />“Then don’t do it as an individual.” <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“If one person can’t do it, then two. If two can’t, then three. And if that still doesn’t work, even more until we can take down the The Teio Academy Ten Sai together.”  <br /> <br />“N-No, that’s not what I meant by individual…Anyway, ganging up is meaningless. Unless I properly defeat them one-on-one–”  <br /> <br />“Huh? Was there a rule like that?” <br /> <br />“Th-There wasn’t but…it’s meaningless if I don’t win with my own ability right?” <br /> <br />“Ahh, Houjou is too serious… It’s fine to just drag them down first, then think about what to do to sit in those seats yourself.” <br /> <br />“Y-You’re…serious about that?” <br /> <br />“Yes. Since even Houjou can’t do it alone, there’s no way I alone could defeat the Ten Sai.”  <br /> <br />For some reason striking a patronizing pose, Mihaneya continues: <br /> <br />“And, the superstar dream I’m after is even more impossible. For any field…unless you have exceptional individual talent, there’s no standing at the top.” <br /> <br />“Ah, my goal is the opposite.” <br /> <br />“Opposite?” <br /> <br />“Yup. I just want to gather as many friends as I can, get them to help help help me out, hype me up, somehow gain fame without me actually doing anything, and end up in a position where I’m doted on worldwide. Being a superstar without any personal ability is the best right?” <br /> <br />“Wh-What is that…relying entirely on others? You don’t need a sense of accomplishment or fulfillment?” <br /> <br />“Don’t need them! I’m fine with just being doted on!” <br /> <br />” ……………… ”  <br /> <br />Houjou seems at a loss for words.  <br /> <br />“So Houjou, let’s be friends! Being friends with a superstar is fun!” <br /> <br />With a wide childlike smile, Mihaneya holds her hand out to Houjou. <br /> <br />“Pfft…!” <br /> <br />Unable to hold it in seeing that hand, Houjou bursts out laughing. <br /> <br />“Getsuka…you’re missing a few screws huh.”  <br /> <br />“Ehehe…” <br /> <br />“Ah, n-not that I’m praising you or anything…” <br /> <br />Please return those screw-sans quickly… <br /> <br />“But it does seem like it’d be fun being beside you…nice to meet you.”  <br /> <br />“Likewise, pleased to befriend you!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Mihaneya beams while Houjou awkwardly shakes hands. <br /> <br />“Speaking of friends, nicknames are a given right? For Reina…how about Rei-chan?” <br /> <br />“Sure, feel free. Then for me let’s see…For Getsuka…is Miko-chan okay?” <br /> <br />“No way that’s getting rejected!” <br /> <br />Knew she’d wanna go with that… <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“I thought Getsuka was stupid but…even more of an idiot than expected…”<br />“Right, but she’s a damn good kid right?”<br />“And if you look closely, super cute too!”<br />“Seems like she’ll stir up something fun!”<br />“Be my friend too!” <br /> </p>

<p>Nice…with Mihaneya accepted by the class, and Houjou’s entourage bowing to her…this looks about wrapped up. <br /> </p>



<p>“Hey, don’t you feel a nice mood?”<br />“Yeah. Class mood was kinda prickly with Houjou irritated.”<br />“Miko-chan seems to have blended in well, we’ve got unity now.”<br />“This is all thanks to…”<br />“Yeah, Ootomo!”<br />…But I don’t like this flow. <br /> <br />Standing out is obviously bad, but being raised up excessively is going overboard. I need to cut this off here somehow.  <br /> <br />Everyone, listen! <br /> <br />If the mood is this good, then revealing everything earlier was just a misunderstanding likely won’t revert Houjou’s attitude or how Mihaneya is treated. <br /> <br />I have to get them to understand I’m a perfectly normal person.  <br /> <br />“The truth is everything about the earlier match was a misunderstanding! Houjou generously interpreted it favorably, but I had no deeper intentions… So in reality…I’m the one who lost!” <br /> <br />“…………” <br /> <br />After a moment of silence from my classmates at this declaration– <br /> </p>



<p>“Pfft!” <br /> <br />In unison, they burst out laughing. <br /> </p>



<p>“No no, too late to say that now!”<br />“Right right. I thought no way at first, but thinking back calmly on Houjou’s explanation, it was a perfect flow.”<br />“If it really was just misunderstandings, you couldn’t explain the earlier weird behavior.”<br />“Haha, humility in excess becomes undesirable!” <br /> </p>



<p>Wh-Why’s it going like this… Granted I can’t explain the weird behavior without mentioning the choices in my head, but… Hm? <br /> <br />Then I notice Mihaneya making eye contact and gesturing over here.  <br /> <br />Right…she knows my goal of avoiding standing out. Doubtless she’ll provide some assistance–alright, I’m counting on you! <br /> <br />“I know it may be hard to believe, but it really was just convenient misunderstandings. The confrontation with Houjou wasn’t pre-planned either, it happened because he got angry for me… Huh? …Was this the right approach? …Eh? …Would it have been better to say it went according to script? …No, but that behavior couldn’t have been acting… Oh, I’m all confused now, but Dai-chan is a really nice person who gets seriously angry for others! <br /> <br />You idiot! <br /> </p>



<p>“So the confrontation itself was planned, but his anger in the process was genuine!?”<br />“On top of intellect, he’s got passion too!?”<br />“What a man…a real man!”<br />The words of a few people quickly spread throughout the classroom– <br /> <br />“Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” “Ootomo!” <br /> <br />You assholeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeeee! <br /> <br />“Ahaha… It seems like my attempt to help you blend in backfired…” <br /> <br />“Is this on purpose…? Did you do this on purpose?” <br /> <br />“N-no, it’s not like that!” <br /> <br />“That’s right… You’re just an idiot.” <br /> <br />“Don’t call me an idiot!” <br /> <br />“Sigh… There’s nothing we can do about what’s already done… Anything we say now will probably make it worse, but little by little, we’ll clear up this strange misunderstanding…” <br /> <br />“…Thank you.” <br /> <br />Before I could continue murmuring, Ohana spoke up. <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“Um… I’m glad you got angry at me.” <br /> <br />“Yeah, well, don’t worry about it. I did it on my own, after all.” <br /> <br />“Even so… Thank you very much.” <br /> <br />“…………I see.” <br /> <br />Feeling somewhat embarrassed, I averted my gaze slightly from Ohana’s face. <br /> <br />“Hehe… I’m glad I could become friends with you, Daikyō-san.” <br /> <br />“I might be regretting it a bit.” <br /> <br />“Huh!?” <br /> <br />“Haha, just kidding… Well, I hope you can forgive us for all this attention.” <br /> <br />I’ll say it again, but my life goal is to not stand out. <br /> <br />Even though things got off to a rough start, this is still just the first day. <br /> <br />It’s a common story for transfer students to let loose in the beginning. <br /> <br />From here on, I’ll return to being my usual self and enjoy a peaceful school life… <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose: ] <br /> <br />① Kiss the wall while shouting the name of your favorite sexy actress. <br /> <br />② Kiss the wall while shouting the name of your favorite female historical figure.] <br />“Hiratsuka Raichō!” <br /> <br />T/N : https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hiratsuka_Raich%C5%8D</p>
