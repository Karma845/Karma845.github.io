<h1>Chapter 2: 6 Main Heroines Who Absolutely Want to Monopolize Me</h1>


<p style="text-align: center"><strong>Shimizu-san Ties Up Her Hair 1</strong></p>

<p>“So you’re the other club member, Seto…”</p>

<p>After Ai-san introduced Seto-san, the first to speak was Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Y-yes.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to be so nervous, Mio-chan. Kei doesn’t bite without a reason.”</p>
<p>“Don’t make it sound like I’ll bite if there is a reason. I’m not a dog.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san glares at Ai-san, but it doesn’t have much effect.</p>

<p>“It’s fine, isn’t it? Kei has a lovable, dog-like charm as well. Anyway, now that we’re all here, let’s do something!”</p>
<p>“I’m going home.”</p>
<p>“What, already? Stay a bit longer.”</p>
<p>“My purpose here is done. There’s no reason for me to stay any longer today, so I’m leaving.”</p>
<p>“But you want to stay with Kei, don’t you, Daiki-kun?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes.”</p>

<p>I inadvertently agreed because my name was suddenly called, but it’s not a lie.</p>
<p>When I look toward Shimizu-san, our eyes meet for just a moment before she looks away.</p>

<p>“I’ll be back here tomorrow anyway, so it’s fine! See you later.”</p>

<p>With those words, Shimizu-san quickly grabs her belongings and leaves the clubroom.</p>

<p>“She left, huh, Kei.”</p>
<p>“Is it my fault?”</p>

<p>Seto-san’s tone remains unchanged, but she seems a bit more subdued than before.</p>

<p>“It’s not your fault, Mio-chan. Even if you hadn’t come, Kei would have left anyway.”</p>
<p>“That’s right. So I don’t think you need to worry too much.”</p>
<p>“…Okay, I hope that’s the case.”</p>

<p>It’s hard to read anything from Seto-san’s expression, but she doesn’t seem to be extremely downcast.</p>

<p>“I’m sure you’ll have a chance to meet with Kei here in the future. You’ll talk then!”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll do that.”</p>
<p>“Okay, then this conversation is over. Ai, let’s go.”</p>
<p>“Go where?”</p>

<p>Ai-san looks puzzled, apparently clueless.</p>

<p>“To the student council room, of course. We’ve been putting off our work to be here, so we should head there soon.”</p>
<p>“I completely forgot! You’re right, if we keep slacking off, it won’t set a good example for the juniors!”</p>

<p>Come to think of it, Yousuke-san and Ai-san are the student council president and vice-president respectively. They must be busy with council duties.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, Yousuke-san and Ai-san were heading out to the corridor.</p>
<p>Then Ai-san turned back to look at Seto-san and me.</p>

<p>“We probably won’t be coming back here today, so Mio-chan and Daiki-kun, take care of the rest! Farewell!”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t run in the corridor, vice-president! Sorry guys, neither Ai nor I will return today. Please handle the rest. See you later.”</p>

<p>With that, Yousuke-san quickly followed Ai-san.</p>

<p>“The senpais have left…”</p>
<p>“Both Ai-san and Yousuke-san are quite busy, huh?”</p>

<p>With the three of them gone, only Seto-san and I remained in the Astronomy Enthusiast Club room.</p>

<p>“Should we head home too, Seto-san?”</p>
<p>“…Wait a moment.”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Seto-san?”</p>
<p>“Just wait for a bit.”</p>
<p>“Okay, but is there something you want to do?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>I have no idea what she wants to do, but if Seto-san wishes to do something, I’d like to help her as a member of the Astronomy Enthusiast Club.</p>

<p>“So, what would you like to do, Seto-san?”</p>
<p>“…I want to talk to you about something.”</p>
<p>“Talk? About what?”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure you want to talk to me about it?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, usually people discuss their concerns with those they’re close to, right? I just wondered if it’s okay for you to discuss it with someone like me, whom you haven’t talked to much. Maybe you could talk to Ai-san?”</p>
<p>“I did talk to Ai-senpai before, but she evaded the topic. Besides, it’s okay. Ai-senpai told me that Hondō-kun is a good person.”</p>
<p>“Ai-san…”</p>

<p>I wonder what Ai-san told Seto-san about me.</p>

<p>“Moreover, since Hondō-kun is a friend of Matsuoka-kun, you’re the best person to talk to about this.”</p>

<p>I didn’t expect Toshiya’s name to come up.</p>
<p>Does this mean that Toshiya is involved in what Seto-san wants to discuss?</p>

<p>“Hondō? Why are you spacing out?”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry.”</p>
<p>“Then, will you listen to what I have to say?”</p>
<p>“…If you think I’m the right person to talk to, then sure.”</p>

<p>After some thought, I decided to be the person Seto-san could confide in.</p>
<p>I wanted to help Seto-san and thought this might give me a chance to find out how Seto-san feels about Toshiya.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Hondō-kun. Then, let me start by talking about someone I’m interested in.”</p>
<p>“What?!”</p>

<p>I burst out in surprise.</p>
<p>If my ears were functioning correctly, Seto-san just said something I totally didn’t expect.</p>

<p>“Are you okay, Hondō-kun?”</p>
<p>“…sorry, that just caught me off guard. Please, go on.”</p>
<p>“Alright, I’ll talk about the person I’m interested in. Oh, I apologize, but I’d like to keep his name a secret.”</p>
<p>“I understand.”</p>
<p>“The person I’m talking about is a boy who’s taller than me…”</p>

<p>It seems like Seto-san is about to describe the person she’s interested in.</p>
<p>She’s not among the taller girls, so most boys are taller than Seto-san.</p>
<p>So, that doesn’t narrow down her crush by much…</p>

<p>“He’s in the library committee as well…”</p>
<p>“Oh?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, never mind. Continue.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but blurt out.</p>
<p>If I heard correctly, Seto-san just mentioned her crush is in the library committee.</p>
<p>There’s only one male library committee member per class, so there aren’t many in the whole school.</p>
<p>That significantly narrows down the possibilities.</p>

<p>“Okay, I’ll continue. And I’ve been in the same class as him since last year…”</p>
<p>“…Seto-san? Can I ask something?”</p>
<p>“What is it this time?”</p>
<p>“By any chance, is this person in the soccer club?”</p>
<p>“…Hondō-kun, are you an esper?”</p>
<p>“Ahaha…”</p>

<p>Of course, I’m not.</p>
<p>There’s only one other person who has been on the library committee and in the same class as both Seto-san and me since last year.</p>

<p>“If you give away that much, it’s pretty clear that the person you’re interested in is Toshiya.”</p>
<p>“I see, Hondō-kun is quite the detective…”</p>
<p>“No, I think anyone who knows about Toshiya would realize that…”</p>

<p>Moreover, she mentioned earlier that since I’m friends with Toshiya, I’m the best person to consult.</p>
<p>I hadn’t noticed before, perhaps because we rarely talked in class, but Seto-san might be a bit of a natural airhead.</p>

<p>“If you’ve figured it out, then it can’t be helped. Yes, I’m interested in Matsuoka-kun.”</p>

<p>As Seto-san confessed that, her face seemed to blush a bit more than before.</p>


<p>“So, that’s how it is….”</p>

<p>Hearing Seto-san’s words, I was a little shaken.</p>
<p>This was because I realized that Toshiya’s feelings weren’t unrequited. Seto-san also has some affection for Toshiya.</p>
<p>If Toshiya heard this, he would likely be overjoyed.</p>
<p>However, since Seto-san confided in me, I won’t directly tell Toshiya.</p>

<p>“So, Seto-san, how do you feel about Toshiya?”</p>
<p>“…It’s hard to put into words, and I might not explain it well, is that okay?”</p>
<p>“That’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Hondō-kun. To begin with, the reason I started to…”</p>

<p>In summary, Seto-san began to notice Toshiya after he approached her during their library committee shift.</p>
<p>At first, Seto-san was distant, but Toshiya persisted, and by the fall of their first year, they began talking more naturally.</p>
<p>Around that time, Seto-san apparently started to look forward to the times they would be alone in the library during their shift.</p>
<p>Their relationship didn’t change much even in their second year, but Seto-san had a recent concern.</p>

<p>“…You’ve been thinking a lot about Toshiya lately, haven’t you?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m troubled because I don’t understand why I keep thinking about Matsuoka-kun.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>“That’s why Ai senpai suggested I talk to you, Hondō-kun.”</p>

<p>Why was I the only one chosen for consultation? I’ll have to ask Ai-san later.</p>
<p>But before I questioned Ai-san, there was something else I wanted to ask Seto-san.</p>

<p>“By the way, can I ask something? Have you ever talked about love with someone else before?”</p>
<p>“…I’ve listened to my friends talk about love, but I’ve never spoken about my feelings.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?”</p>
<p>“I didn’t understand what it felt like to be in love.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>

<p>It seems Seto-san can’t quite put her feelings toward Toshiya into words.</p>

<p>“…Hondō-kun, can I ask you something?”</p>
<p>“Sure, if I can answer.”</p>

<p>I wonder what Seto-san wants to ask.</p>
<p>Honestly, I have no idea.</p>

<p>“Do you think I like Matsuoka-kun?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>A completely unexpected question was thrown at me by Seto-san.</p>

<p>“Why are you asking me?”</p>
<p>“Ai Senpai said that I should talk to Hondō-kun about it, and I thought that Hondō-kun might be able to understand my feelings.”</p>

<p>Seto-san’s expression remained mostly unchanged, and I couldn’t quite discern what she was thinking, but her eyes were serious.</p>
<p>If Seto-san is genuinely asking, I need to answer seriously as well.</p>

<p>“…I can’t definitively say for sure whether you love Toshiya or not. I’ve never been in love, so I’m not sure what qualifies as love.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>
<p>“But from what I’ve heard, I believe that Toshiya is important to you.”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>

<p>Seto-san slowly tilted her head to the side.</p>
<p>It seems she wasn’t quite aware of this.</p>

<p>“If you didn’t care about Toshiya, I don’t think you’d spend so much time pondering about him.”</p>
<p>“…I see. That makes sense.”</p>
<p>“I can’t tell if considering Toshiya as precious equates to being in love, though.”</p>

<p>Seto-san placed her right hand over her mouth and became still.</p>
<p>Was she reflecting on what I said?</p>

<p>“Thank you, Hondō-kun. It seems I do cherish Matsuoka-kun.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad I could help.”</p>
<p>“But I still don’t know if this emotion is love. So, I have another favor to ask of you, Hondō-kun.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>Her unchanged expression made it even more challenging to anticipate her request than anyone else’s before.</p>

<p>“I’d like to talk about love with you again.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine, but why?”</p>
<p>“If we discuss love, I might get a better understanding of it. Then, maybe I’ll be able to determine if my feelings for Matsuoka-kun are love.”</p>
<p>“Is it okay if I’m the one you talk to?”</p>
<p>“You answered my questions earnestly, Hondō-kun. Plus, you know Matsuoka-kun well, so it’s easier to talk about him with you.”</p>
<p>“Alright, if you’re okay with me, let’s talk about love again later.”</p>

<p>Even though we spoke briefly, Seto-san seemed genuinely troubled, and I wanted to help.</p>

<p>“Thank you. I’ll count on you from now on.”</p>

<p>With that, Seto-san gave a slight bow.</p>

<p>“You’re welcome.”</p>

<p>I returned the bow.</p>
<p>A few seconds later, I raised my head, and Seto-san raised her head too.</p>

<p>“So, what should we do now? Continue our talk about love? Or should we end it for today?”</p>
<p>“Just a moment.”</p>

<p>I pulled out my smartphone from my backpack to check the time.</p>
<p>More time had passed than I’d realized. I think I should head home soon to prepare dinner.</p>

<p>“Sorry, I have something to take care of. Can we continue tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“That’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. Let’s continue our love talk tomorrow then.”</p>
<p>“Yes, see you tomorrow.”</p>

<p>I put on my backpack, waved goodbye to Seto-san, and left the Astronomy Enthusiast Club room.</p>
<p>The next day after school, I came to the Astronomy Club room again.</p>
<p>When I knocked and entered, there was another member besides Seto-san inside.</p>
<p>The person had her head down on the desk, obscuring her face, but the long, beautiful black hair made me think it could only be Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Hello, Seto-san. Is that Shimizu-san? Is she sleeping?”</p>
<p>“Yes, she was already asleep when I got here.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>She must have come here right after school ended.</p>
<p>I recall noticing Shimizu-san’s absence when I left the classroom.</p>
<p>Maybe she’s tired from the physical education class earlier.</p>

<p>“I wonder if Ai-san and Yousuke-san will come a little later.”</p>

<p>After placing my backpack on the desk, I sat in a chair opposite Shimizu-san and beside Seto-san.</p>

<p>“Ai-senpai contacted me saying they’ll be a little late due to some errands.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for letting me know. So, what should we do until they arrive…”</p>
<p>“Of course, continuing from yesterday.”</p>

<p>Seto-san seems extremely eager. She must’ve really wanted to talk about love.</p>
<p>For some reason, I felt Shimizu-san, who should be asleep, twitch a little.</p>

<p>“Do you think it’s okay even if Shimizu-san might wake up?”</p>
<p>“What I want to talk today is not something I don’t want her to hear, so it’s okay. How about you, Hondō-kun?”</p>

<p>Personally, I don’t mind if Shimizu-san hears our conversation.</p>
<p>If Seto-san is okay with it, there’s probably no reason to stop her.</p>

<p>“… If you say so, Seto-san, then it’s fine with me.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Hondō-kun.”</p>
<p>“So, what should we discuss today?”</p>
<p>“I studied a bit about love topics at home after I left yesterday. Can I decide the topic?”</p>
<p>“Sure, that’s fine.”</p>

<p>I did say it’s okay, but studying about love topics?</p>
<p>I wonder what Seto-san did at home.</p>

img here

<p>“Today’s love topic is ‘preferred hairstyles of the opposite sex.’ “</p>
<p>“Hairstyle?”</p>
<p>“Yes, I want to hear things like, ‘boys get charmed by this kind of hairstyle.’ “</p>

<p>I was a little surprised to hear the word ‘charmed’ coming out of Seto-san’s mouth. But still, hairstyles, huh…</p>

<p>“I think hairstyle preferences vary a lot, even among boys.”</p>

<p>For instance, while I prefer girls with long hair, Toshiya likes those with short hair.</p>
<p>Although in Toshiya’s case, it might just be because Seto-san has shorter hair that he prefers short hairstyles.</p>

<p>“I see… What kind of hairstyle do you like, Hondō-kun?”</p>
<p>“I prefer long hair.”</p>
<p>“I see. So, which hairstyle exactly do you like?”</p>
<p>“Huh? I said I like long hair…”</p>
<p>“I’m asking about the specific hairstyle you like, not just whether you prefer long or short hair.”</p>

<p>I finally understood the intention behind her question.</p>
<p>It seems my answer was a bit off from what she was asking.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry, but I’m not really familiar with women’s hairstyles.”</p>
<p>“…Got it. I have a solution. Just wait a moment.”</p>

<p>With that, Seto-san stood up and started walking towards a particular bookshelf in the room.</p>

<p>“Ai-senpai had it here… Ah, found it.”</p>

<p>Seto-san took a magazine from the shelf and returned to her seat.</p>

<p>“This is a fashion magazine that Ai-senpai keeps here. There might be a hairstyle you like inside.”</p>

<p>I took the fashion magazine from Seto-san.</p>
<p>After scanning it for a few minutes, there was one model with a hairstyle that somewhat caught my attention.</p>

<p>“…I think the hairstyle of this model is nice.”</p>

<p>I pointed to the model in the fashion magazine to show Seto-san.</p>

<p>“So, Hondō-kun likes the half-up hairstyle.”</p>
<p>“That’s called a half-up?”</p>

<p>I looked at the magazine again.</p>
<p>There was a model with her hair tied up in the back.</p>

<p>“Why do you like this hairstyle?”</p>
<p>“Well, I like girls who look neat and clean. Doesn’t the half-up give off a clean and tidy vibe?”</p>
<p>“I can see what you’re saying. Would you be excited if you saw a girl with such a hairstyle in real life?”</p>
<p>“I can’t say for sure unless I see it in person, but I think it would catch my attention.”</p>

<p>The desk shook slightly again.</p>
<p>Reflexively, I looked towards Shimizu-san, but there was no noticeable change.</p>
<p>Relieved, I turned my gaze back to the fashion magazine.</p>

<p>“I struggle to wake up in the morning, so getting to school is a big task for me. I think it’s incredible for someone to take the time in the morning to style their hair like this.”</p>
<p>“I see. So, Hondō-kun respects girls who take the time to style their hair. That’s good to know.”</p>

<p>With that, Seto-san took out a Post-it note she had on hand and attached it to the magazine’s page.</p>

<p>“Why the Post-it note?”</p>
<p>“Just thought I should remember it.”</p>

<p>In the middle of our conversation, the door swung open with great force.</p>
<p>Looking towards the door, there stood Ai-san.</p>

<p>“Ah, Kei and Daiki-kun are here too! Shimizu Ai, though late, has now arrived!”</p>
<p>“Good afternoon, Ai-san.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for the greeting, Daiki-kun. Oh, is it Kei’s naptime right now?”</p>

<p>Hearing Ai-san’s voice, Shimizu-san slowly sat up.</p>

<p>“You were awake, Kei?”</p>
<p>“You woke me up with your loud voice! Keep it down a bit.”</p>
<p>“What? Are you asking me to suppress one of my many great qualities, my loud voice?”</p>
<p>“You don’t have that many qualities. And a loud voice isn’t really a positive one.”</p>
<p>“That’s not true, right? Mio-chan?”</p>
<p>“…I’ll keep my mouth silent.”</p>
<p>“Mio-chan? The silence here means an affirmation.”</p>

<p>Though it’s hard to tell from her expression, it seems Seto-san also has her own feelings about it.</p>

<p>“You guys are so mean! Daiki-kun wouldn’t say something like that, right?”</p>
<p>“Y-yeah.”</p>
<p>“See? Daiki-kun said he could listen to my clear and loud voice for hours without getting tired of it!”</p>
<p>“Stop making things up; it’s obvious. And Hondō, don’t spoil Ai.”</p>

<p>I was glared sharply by Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Anyway, let’s leave the topic of my beautiful voice aside for now. Look at this!”</p>

<p>Ai-san took out two printouts. At the top of the printout, it was labeled ‘Club Application.’</p>

<p>“It’s okay to fill out the club application, but will this club really become an official club?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry about that. Yousuke and I looked into it, and it seems there was a similar case a few years ago. This time, we have met the number of members and have a faculty advisor, so if we prepare the necessary documents, I think we can smoothly upgrade to the Astronomy Club.”</p>
<p>“I hope that’s the case.”</p>
<p>“And if there’s any trouble, I’ll handle it with the authority of the student council vice-president. Hehehe…”</p>

<p>Saying that, Ai-san wore a mischievous grin.</p>

<p>“Don’t abuse your power.”</p>
<p>“It’s just a joke, well, half-joking.”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>

<p>It seemed like I wasn’t the only one who thought she was more than half serious.</p>

<p>“Absolutely true. For today, all I need Kei and Daiki-kun to do is fill out the club application and submit it to me, then Yousuke and I will handle the other details. If you have any questions while filling it out, ask me.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>

<p>In the end, after filling out the application that day, we chatted with Ai-san at the center of the conversation until it was time to leave.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>The next morning, when I arrived at the classroom, I noticed something different.</p>

<p>“Huh, Shimizu-san hasn’t arrived yet.”</p>

<p>When Shimizu-san was a first-year in high school, it wasn’t rare for her to be late, but lately, she’s been arriving before me. I wondered if something had happened to Shimizu-san.</p>
<p>As I was getting worried, I heard the door opening and footsteps approaching.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Shimizu-san…”</p>
<p>“M-morning.”</p>

<p>I was taken aback.</p>
<p>The owner of the footsteps was Shimizu-san. To be more precise, it was Shimizu-san with her hair tied back.</p>
<p>Her hairstyle today matched the one of the model I saw in the fashion magazine yesterday.</p>

img here

<p>“You changed your hairstyle from the usual.”</p>
<p>“Ah, yes.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san took her seat.</p>
<p>I wondered why she chose today of all days to change her hairstyle?</p>

<p>“Why are you staring at me like that?”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry.”</p>

<p>It seems I was unconsciously staring at Shimizu-san because I was curious.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to apologize…I knew it, does it not suit me?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san asked with a lack of confidence.</p>

<p>“It’s not like that. I just thought you have a different atmosphere from usual and it’s pretty cute. Well, it’s more like beautiful rather than cute.”</p>
<p>“Hey, I didn’t ask for such a detailed compliment!”</p>

<p>For some reason, Shimizu-san seemed flustered and her voice was louder than usual.</p>

<p>“But why did you decide to change your hairstyle today?”</p>
<p>“Ugh, well… it was just a whim.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san claimed so while avoiding eye contact.</p>

<p>“I see. You always had the same hairstyle, so I was surprised.”</p>
<p>“T-this much is normal.”</p>

<p>The bell rang, indicating the start of the morning homeroom, and Yuasa sensei, our class teacher, entered the room.</p>
<p>It seems like it’s time to stop chatting.</p>

<p>“Well then, Shimizu-san, see you later.”</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“Huh, Shimizu-san hasn’t arrived yet again?”</p>

<p>When I arrived at school as usual the day after Shimizu-san appeared with her hair in a half-up style, Shimizu-san was still not here either.</p>
<p>Then, about five minutes after I arrived in the classroom, Shimizu-san appeared.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Morning.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san had her hair in the same half-up style as yesterday.</p>

<p>“Oh, you kept the half-up hairstyle today as well?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san took her seat.</p>
<p>As I was searching my backpack for the assignment I had to submit today, I felt someone staring at me.</p>
<p>I looked around and realized it was Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“What is it, Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s nothing…”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san seemed restless contrary to her words.</p>
<p>I wasn’t sure how to respond.</p>

<p>“Do you have something you want to tell me?”</p>
<p>“It’s more like something I want you to say rather than something I want to say…”</p>

<p>I managed to hear Shimizu-san’s mumbled words.</p>

<p>“What do you want me to say?”</p>
<p>“I heard you say it before…that…”</p>
<p>“That?”</p>
<p>“…Never mind. Homeroom is about to start.”</p>
<p>“O-okay then.”</p>

<p>In the end, I never found out what Shimizu-san wanted to say.</p>

<p>***</p>
<p>The next day when I entered the classroom, there was already a female student sitting in Shimizu-san’s seat.</p>
<p>I called out to her from behind.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“Why are you greeting me like it was a question?”</p>
<p>“Your figure from behind looked different, so I wasn’t sure…”</p>

<p>Today, Shimizu-san’s hair was tied back in a single ponytail, different from the previous days.</p>
<p>I could see the nape of her neck, usually hidden by her long hair, and it took me by surprise.</p>

img here

<p>“You changed your hairstyle today?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah.”</p>
<p>“The half-up was nice, but the ponytail suits you too.”</p>
<p>“I, I see…”</p>

<p>For some reason, Shimizu-san covered her mouth with her hand.</p>

<p>“Anyway, why did you decide on a ponytail today? Another whim like before?”</p>
<p>“The weather looked clear and warm today. This hairstyle should help alleviate some of the heat.”</p>
<p>“I guess so.”</p>

<p>That’s true, the weather today was clear with no cloud in the sky, and the sun had been shining down since morning.</p>

<p>After that, I didn’t bring up Shimizu-san’s hairstyle again, and soon it was time for homeroom.</p>
<p>Ever since then, depending on the day, Shimizu-san would come to school with a different hairstyle.</p>
<p>Some days, she had a bun, another day in a braided half-up, and other days, she sported a French braid.</p>
<p>The variety was astonishing.</p>

<p>Why did Shimizu-san change her hairstyle every day?</p>
<p>I wondered about this, but Shimizu-san would only say it was a whim.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, about ten days had passed since she started switching up her hair.</p>
<p>Watching Shimizu-san change her hairstyle every day, the class had various reactions.</p>
<p>Some said it was a harbinger of rain, others a sign of an impending storm, and some were simply bewildered.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“…haah… haa…”</p>

<p>One weekday morning, I was rushing to class, panting.</p>
<p>The reason for my haste was simple: homeroom was about to start.</p>

<p>(I should have tried a simpler hairstyle.)</p>

<p>The reason I was on the verge of being late today was that I tried a more complicated hairstyle than usual.</p>
<p>I couldn’t get the braids right, and as I kept retrying, time slipped away. That’s why I had to leave my house in a hurry.</p>
<p>Last year, I wouldn’t have cared about being late, but now things were different. If I were late, Hondō would undoubtedly be worried.</p>
<p>That’s not what I wanted.</p>

<p>(I feel like I’ve been thinking about him more than before.)</p>

<p>The reason I started styling my hair before coming to school from last week was to get even a bit of Hondō’s attention.</p>
<p>Every time I changed my hairstyle, Hondō would say it suited me or that I looked pretty.</p>
<p>Just hearing those words made me feel that waking up early and struggling with my hair was worth it.</p>

<p>(Well, since I didn’t style my hair today, he probably won’t say anything.)</p>

<p>Lost in thought, I found myself already in the classroom.</p>
<p>It looked like I had narrowly avoided being late.</p>
<p>As I walked to my seat, Hondō, probably alerted by the sound of my footsteps, turned to look at me.</p>

<p>“Good morning, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Morning.”</p>

<p>After putting down my bag and shifting my gaze to Hondō, he had a gentle smile on his face.</p>

<p>“Why are you looking at me and smiling?”</p>
<p>“Huh, was I smiling?”</p>

<p>He seemed genuinely unaware.</p>

<p>“You were. What’s so funny?”</p>

<p>I unintentionally furrowed my brow.</p>
<p>Most classmates would back off with just that, but Hondō was as unfazed as ever.</p>

<p>“I think I was probably relieved.”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Well, Shimizu-san, it’s been a while since you had your usual hairstyle.”</p>

<p>Why would Hondō feel relieved when I don’t tie up my hair?</p>
<p>As I was struggling to grasp the connection, Hondō began speaking again.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, you’ve been changing your hairstyle every day recently, right? Every unfamiliar hairstyle felt like a new side of Shimizu-san I hadn’t known, and honestly, it made my heart race.”</p>
<p>“Wha…?”</p>
<p>“And so, I was thinking that my heart couldn’t take it anymore, but when you came today with your usual straight hair, I think I felt relieved. …Wait, why are you covering your face?”</p>
<p>“D-Don’t look at me now.”</p>

<p>It couldn’t be helped that I needed to hide my face with both hands.</p>
<p>Why does Hondō always manage to shake my emotions like this?</p>
<p>After several moments, I regained some composure and moved my hands away from my face.</p>

<p>“…So you get, you know, you get excited when I tie my hair?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah.”</p>
<p>“And you feel relieved seeing my usual hairstyle?”</p>
<p>“That’s right.”</p>

<p>Then, I knew what I needed to do.</p>

<p>“…I see. Then I’ll keep this hairstyle from now on.”</p>
<p>“You don’t need to do that for my sake, you know? I think I’ll gradually get used to seeing you with tied-up hair.”</p>
<p>“I’m not doing it for you or anything. I just got tired of tying it up.”</p>
<p>“If that’s the case, then okay…”</p>

<p>Of course, it wasn’t because I found it troublesome.</p>
<p>I decided to keep the hairstyle adjustments as my trump card for crucial moments.</p>
