<h1>Chapter 2: Gal and Break Time</h1>


<p>A few days have passed by since I went to a light novel author’s autograph session with Tsumakawa-san (also known as Minacho-san).</p>

<p>“Yes, that’s all for today. Next, we’ll be working on the translation of page 36 from Japanese to English. Please have the English text for this page translated by next Wednesday’s class.”</p>

<p>Said the English teacher, leaving the classroom.</p>
<p>Simultaneously, the third-period bell chimed, marking the end of the third class.</p>
<p>Thus, as the break time began, the classroom was enveloped in noise.</p>
<p>Amidst this, one of my two male friends in this class, Koyama (a fat guy), approached my seat and spoke to me.</p>

<p>“I say, let us venture to the restroom together!”</p>
<p>“Why are you inviting me to the restroom in a samurai’s tone? Samurai guys would be the least likely to show off when they go to the restroom.”</p>
<p>“Should you choose to stay behind, I shall embark on this journey alone.”</p>
<p>“Why is this guy declaring he’ll go to the bathroom alone in such a poetic way…”</p>

<p>As I retorted to Koyama, my other male friend in this class, Iijima (a boy with a neutral face), entered our circle and said to Koyama,</p>

<p>“My companion, allow me to accompany you on a brief sojourn to the restroom!”</p>
<p>“I’m forever indebted. Let’s proceed in unison, my companion.”</p>
<p>“You two are unreasonably close… Instead of having poetic conversations, just get to the point and go to the restroom!”</p>

<p>Ignoring my comment, my friends, engaged in a poetic exchange of words, headed to the restroom.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, I remained in the classroom, taking out a light novel covered with a book cover from my student bag.</p>
<p>This light novel is one of those inspirational works that become a bit of an online sensation lately—and I personally rate it about 3 stars at the moment.</p>

<p>…I don’t know, why do otaku always rush to rate and review works?</p>
<p>And please, spare us the reviews like ‘The corner of the book was bent, so one star!’</p>
<p>Come on, don’t be so harsh on the author!</p>

<p>As I continued reading the half-finished light novel in silence, suddenly, someone lightly tapped my left shoulder twice.</p>

<p>“Whoa!?”</p>

<p>Since being touched by anyone other than my male friends was rare, I flinched for a moment and quickly turned to confirm the person who had tapped my shoulder.</p>
<p>And there she was… in a slightly disheveled uniform, with subtle makeup and an unexpectedly cheerful smile—It was the white gal Tsumakawa-san!</p>

<p>“…Wow, seriously, it’s really Nezumayo. Nezumayo is in my class. Yatta!”</p>
<p>“What do you mean it’s really Nezumayo… Seriously, Tsumakawa-san, you didn’t even know I was your classmate?”</p>
<p>“Hey, it’s not like I didn’t know! It’s just that I didn’t recognize Yoda? He’s so unnoticeable that I hardly register him in my memory…”</p>
<p>“If you’re going to make excuses, can you at least rehearse them properly before giving them?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know about Yoda, but I can always recognize Nezumayo! Yay!”</p>
<p>“W-Why are you separating me and Nezumayo in your thoughts, this gal… There’s no need to differentiate between Yoda and Nezumayo. They’re the same, okay?”</p>

<p>As I retorted like that, Tsumakawa-san laughed cheerfully, then pointed to the book I was reading and asked,</p>

<p>“Anyway, what are you reading?”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“Hmm? Why are you silent? Hehe, that’s funny.”</p>

<p>With those words and a carefree smile, she spoke, but on the other hand, I hurriedly checked the situation around me.</p>
<p>Then, I realized that the gaze of several classmates was directed at us, it’s probably something like—why was that socially awkward introverted guy getting spoken to by the popular Tsumakawa-san? Their curious looks were pouring down on me.</p>
<p>Confirming that, I whispered to her in a small voice.</p>

<p>“…by the way, Tsumakawa-san? In a classroom with other people around, isn’t it better if someone like me, who’s kind of an introvert, doesn’t get approached by someone like you, who’s a shining star in the class?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Why?”</p>
<p>“Why, you ask… It’s because you might end up getting weird looks, and…”</p>
<p>“…Ah, I see. You mean in terms of the school caste or something like that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, exactly! Since the caste is out of balance, isn’t it important to be separated?”</p>
<p>“Hmm-mmh. Separating interactions between members of the same class is important——Cut it out, I don’t really know about that, you idiot.”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa, who initially seemed to understand what I said, for some reason, responded with a somewhat offensive remark and lightly struck my shoulder.</p>
<p>Huh? Why did she show a reaction that seemed like she agreed with me for a moment…?</p>
<p>After that, she casually moved to the seat next to mine, Matsuda-kun’s seat—it’s a classic extrovert move, I thought—then rested her elbows on someone else’s desk and continued speaking while letting out a sigh.</p>

<p>“I’m a huge fan of light novels, you see? So I really love school caste rom-coms that deal with hierarchies too! But… do we really need to bring that into reality?”</p>
<p>“Huh? What do you mean…”</p>
<p>“I mean, in reality, there’s no such thing as a school caste or hierarchy.”</p>

<p>Saying that, she quickly scanned the entire classroom.</p>
<p>Tsumakawa was saying this, but in reality—there are groups like the otaku boys, the sports boys, the flashy second-unit girls, and the first-unit of mixed-gender group that Tsumakawa normally belonged to in this class——In fact, this class did have a clear caste-like structure.</p>

<p>Right after I reconfirmed that, Tsumakawa spoke with a nonchalant expression.</p>

<p>“What exists is just the division into groups, right? And you can say your group is just an another circle. There’s no ‘higher’ or ‘lower’ in that sense.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>
<p>“That’s why it’s okay to talk to Nezumayo like this, and it’s the same the other way around. Well, saying ‘it’s okay to talk’ doesn’t really sound nice. It’s more like, there’s no good or bad in either case.”</p>
<p>” …But I think you can say that precisely because you’re higher up in the caste…”</p>
<p>“No, seriously, I’m telling you, there’s no ‘higher’ or ‘lower’! Nezumayo is just assuming he’s beneath others on his own. You’re only pretending there’s some nonexistent caste and looking at it from a skewed perspective. Stop putting on airs. Are you some light novel protagonist or what?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Me, a light novel protagonist…?”</p>
<p>“Seems like you’re a bit happy to hear that.”</p>

<p>The series of statements from Tsumakawa just now used values I don’t possess, so actually, I couldn’t help but be slightly impressed.</p>
<p>To see oneself as equal to everyone else, not feeling superior or inferior to your classmates—this is something that can only be done by someone who truly ‘acknowledges their own worth.’</p>
<p>In other words, Tsumakawa might actually be someone who takes pride in the way she lives.</p>
<p>Her perspective is a bit too dazzling for me…</p>


<p>As I was pondering over such thoughts, Tsumakawa let out a deep sigh and then waved her hands in front of my face a few times.</p>

<p>“Okay. Well, this boring conversation is over now! I don’t want to go on for more than two minutes talking about complicated stuff. I’m on the verge of collapsing from fever!”</p>
<p>“Huh? Where was the complicated part in the conversation just now…?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Let’s just talk without too much thinking! By the way, take a look at these nails. Aren’t they super cute? Isn’t it dangerously cute?”</p>
<p>“…oh, they’re amazing. Do you have to have a specialist do this kind of work?”</p>
<p>“No-no, like I said, Nezumayo, you’re still thinking too much. You don’t have to use your head—Okay, let’s go one more time—Nezumayo, look at my nails. Aren’t they super cute?”</p>
<p>“…Cute. Dangerously cute.”</p>
<p>“See! They’re super cute, right? How about this one?”</p>
<p>“Cute—”</p>
<p>“If you had to say whether they’re not cute or cute, which one is it?”</p>
<p>“Cute—”</p>
<p>“My nails are way too cute! But seriously, I’m getting hungry. Nezumayo, what kind of food do you like?”</p>
<p>“Curry.”</p>
<p>“Totally get that. Curry is crazy good, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah…Curry is delicious.”</p>
<p>“I’m craving curry…Wait, my mouth just turned into curry. Don’t mess around!”</p>
<p>“Ahaha, sorry.”</p>
<p>” I won’t forgive you that easily. But if you eat curry with me next time, I’ll forgive you.”</p>
<p>“Ahahah—Talking so casually like this is making my brain melt!”</p>

<p>I was going along with Tsumakawa’s conversation without thinking, but it felt like I was starting to get more nonsensical than she was. </p>

<p>‘Curry is crazy good, isn’t it?’</p>
<p>‘Yeah…Curry is delicious.’</p>
<p>What the heck…</p>

<p>——The exchange was so shallow, it was like we weren’t even talking.</p>
<p>I kept making mental comments like that, and then Tsumakawa, looking intentionally annoyed, shot me a comment.</p>

<p>“Hey, Nezumayo-kun, you’ve been talking pretty randomly for a while now, haven’t you? We’re having a nice chat together, but your attitude, seriously, I don’t like it.”</p>
<p>“What an unreasonable gal…”</p>

<p>As I retorted, Tsumakawa burst into laughter as if she couldn’t hold back anymore.</p>
<p>…It was a talent to be able to have such a good time talking with an introvert like me.</p>
<p>While thinking that, I side-glanced at Tsumakawa.</p>

<p>To be honest, I’m not good with gals. I mean, I’m not good with real-life girls in general, but gals in particular.</p>
<p>The reason is simple—it’s because girls like them are an existence that I, an introverted guy like me, can’t understand at all. But she’s a fellow fan of light novels, also known as ‘Minacho-san.’</p>

<p>That fact made Tsumakawa-san an even more mysterious person to me.</p>
<p>I’m totally lost now… Even though I don’t really understand Gals, and she’s a girl in the three-dimensional world that I usually don’t get, there are parts that I do understand about her…</p>

<p>While I was thinking about these things that were too confusing to grasp, Tsumakawa waved her hand in front of my face and asked again after pointing a book in my hand.</p>

<p>“By the way, we got off track, but what book is this?”</p>
<p>“Oh, this? This is… a work called 『Tears of Zero』…”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>When I mentioned the title, Tsumakawa fell into a subtle silence. In response, I almost burst into laughter and asked her:</p>

<p>“Did you read it too, Tsumakawa-san?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I did…I didn’t quite get it, though.”</p>
<p>“I see, so you did find it boring.”</p>
<p>“Hey, wait a minute. I said I didn’t get it! I didn’t say it wasn’t interesting. Don’t interpret it that way without my permission!”</p>
<p>“But, Tsumakawa-san—Minacho-san often says that using the word ‘uninteresting’ feels like giving up on understanding the work. In other words, your ‘didn’t get it’ is Minacho-san’s way of saying ‘it wasn’t interesting.'”</p>
<p>“…I hate perceptive introverts.”</p>

<p>After saying that, Tsumakawa chuckled and then followed up with a wry smile, continuing:</p>

<p>“I really love light novels, so I want to love any kind of light novel, but what should I do when there are these ‘unapproachable’ works that come up?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it okay? Having likes and dislikes about work is only natural as a person. In fact, saying ‘I love all works!’ makes me feel like that person doesn’t truly love any of them.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? I think people who can love any work are simply showing their ‘capacity to enjoy.’ That’s why I want to be that kind of person too… But the book Nezumayo is reading right now, I kind of—didn’t get it!”</p>
<p>“Wouldn’t it be more refreshing to just vomit it all out?”</p>

<p>In response to my retort, Tsumakawa covered her ears with both hands.</p>

<p>“Ah-what, I can’t hear you.”</p>

<p>She seemed like a child, and while I was smiling at that thought, she continued her words.</p>

<p>“Well, you know, people who don’t just talk about what they like, but also what they don’t like, have more power in what they say because they are honest. This is why I really like you Nezumayo-kun. You harshly criticize even the super popular light novels like a contrarian otaku.”</p>
<p>“Please, could you stop mentioning my account name in class over and over…? My name is Yoda…”</p>
<p>“Well, occasionally that Nezumayo guy doesn’t even spare my favorite light novels from his criticism, so sometimes I start fights with him on Twitter!”</p>
<p>“Can you please stop that? What’s the point for both of us in that situation?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not about personal gain or loss. It’s because there is a version of me that can’t stand and lets my favorite things be belittled without saying anything!”</p>
<p>“Isn’t this gal’s way of thinking a bit too yankee…?”</p>
<p>“Ah… Oh right, I forgot! I actually brought a light novel I planned to lend you, thinking I’d meet Nezumayo-kun today. Just wait a moment!”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa said that and retrieved a student folder from her desk. Then she placed it on the desk next to me—Matsuda-kun’s desk.</p>
<p>Afterward, sitting back down in Matsuda-kun’s seat, she started taking out light novels from her bag one after another.</p>

<p>“First, there’s 『Can a Boy-Girl Friendship Hold Up? (No, It Can’t!!)』, then there’s『Paradise Noise』, 『When Nekura and Hiria Meet』, and 『Kino’s Journey: the Beautiful World』.. I had a hard time narrowing it down since there were so many I wanted to strongly recommend!”</p>
<p>“A-Ah, Tsumakawa-san, is it really okay for you to be so open about this around everyone!?”</p>

<p>I commented to her as Tsumakawa-san took out several novels with cute 2D girls on their covers from her school bag and laid them out on someone else’s desk.</p>
<p>Seriously, shouldn’t you be concerned about what others might think!?</p>
<p>While I was thinking like that, she calmly replied with a composed expression.</p>

<p>“Hmm? Well, I’ve already told my close friends that I’m really into otaku stuff. So, I’m totally fine! Anyway, more importantly—here you go. If there’s anything you’re interested in, let me know. Don’t hesitate, okay? Young people shouldn’t hold back, you know?”</p>
<p>“Are you treating me like a spoiled grandchild…? Um, Tsumakawa-san… I really appreciate it, but I’ve actually read all of these before…”</p>
<p>“…Even though I went through the trouble of bringing them here, what the heck? If you’ve already read all of them, you should have said so earlier! Don’t mess with me!”</p>
<p>“Despite your annoyed words, why do you still have a smiling face?”</p>
<p>“Because——if you’ve read all my recommendations, doesn’t that mean you have the same taste as me? So naturally, my spirits rise—In my recommendations, do you have any favorite works?”</p>
<p>“…Honestly, I love all of them…”</p>
<p>“Wow, seriously? You’re the best! High five!”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa-san patted my shoulder energetically. It kind of hurt a bit…</p>
<p>As I was thinking this, she started to tidy up the spread-out novels on the desk and continued,</p>


<p>Tsumakawa-san patted my shoulder energetically. It kind of hurt a bit.</p>
<p>As I was thinking this, she started to tidy up the spread-out novels on the desk and continued,</p>

<p>“Even though I brought these light novels to lend to Nezumayo-kun, it seems like it was pointless… Hehe. I should have brought some more obscure ones.”</p>
<p>“I mean, I never asked you to lend me any light novels, and yet you bring them to school on your own. You’ve got a lot of energy…”</p>
<p>“Well, you know, if Nezumayo-kun is here in our class, it’s natural to want to share the things I like. Besides, I want to borrow Nezumayo’s recommendations sometime too, so let’s exchange light novels!”</p>
<p>“T-that’s fine, but… It’s just that, Tsumakawa-san, you really are Minacho-san…”</p>
<p>“It’s kind of obvious right now?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, it’s obvious to say that, but it’s like I’ve realized it all over again. The fact that Minacho-san is this kind of gal, I’m still a bit puzzled…”</p>
<p>“Hey… Could it be that Nezumayo dislikes gals?”</p>
<p>“Dislikes? Well, The word feels a bit too strong, but…”</p>
<p>“Heheh, it’s okay to dislike them. Eventually, I’ll make you like them.”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>

<p>As soon as she said that, I unintentionally lowered my gaze to the floor.</p>
<p>I realized again that she was a dangerously suggestive person who could suddenly say such things.</p>
<p>Dangerous, if I wasn’t the trained virgin, I might have fallen in love—</p>

<p>“Even if it’s not Nezumayo’s preference, gals are seriously cute, right? You see, when I’m talking with my gal friends who model alongside me, I genuinely think that gals are cute.”</p>
<p>“Huh… By the way, you mentioned it a bit before, but Tsumakawa-san, are you doing modeling work?”</p>
<p>“Yep! It’s for a gal magazine called 『leg』 Have you heard of it?”</p>
<p>“No, I haven’t studied it enough…”</p>
<p>“Ahaha. You should start learning about gals from now on. It might come up on a test!”</p>
<p>“Wait, there is a test? If they add ‘Gal I’ to the subjects for the end-of-term exam for the first semester, I’d hate that.”</p>
<p>“Now for the first question! What’s the difference between sculpted nails and gel nails?”</p>
<p>“I don’t even know that there are two types of nails…”</p>
<p>“The correct answer is that gel nails are easier to do, so they’re better!”</p>
<p>“The correct answer sounds so stereotypical you gal! There was definitely a more significant difference that was better to use for the answer!”</p>

<p>After retorting like that to Tsumakawa’s gal test, I absentmindedly looked at the wall clock in the classroom, which showed three minutes before noon.</p>
<p>The break for the third period was also coming to an end, and seeing that, I couldn’t help but ask her about something that had been bothering me a little.</p>

<p>“It’s not really important, but Tsumakawa-san, you tried to become friends with me the other day, and I turned you down, right? Despite that, why did you bring light novels to lend me and talk to me like this during break time?”</p>

<p>As I voiced this question, I immediately regretted even bringing it up – maybe I shouldn’t have asked. After all, this could be considered disrespectful to her.</p>
<p>While it’s true that I, who tends to avoid real-life interactions with women, would prefer to keep a certain distance from Tsumakawa, I still shouldn’t use that as a reason to hurt her.</p>
<p>While I was reflecting on this, Tsumakawa, who had been subjected to some rather harsh words from me, casually responded to my question.</p>

<p>“Why did I start talking to you when we’re not even friends?”</p>

<p>She did so with a carefree smile on her face.</p>

<p>“Well? Because I want to be friends.”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“You should’ve figured that much on your own. Don’t make me say it~.”</p>

<p>Saying that, Tsumakawa leaned her fist on my shoulder and playfully rubbed it while wearing a slightly embarrassed expression.</p>
<p>I see. For such a reason, she was willing to talk with someone who had rejected her offer of friendship…</p>

<p>I’m sure that Tsumakawa and I have completely different common sense and values.</p>
<p>After all, she’s a sociable gal, and I’m a socially awkward otaku.</p>
<p>If it were me, I would want to keep my distance from someone I hadn’t gotten along with in the past, but she’s completely different.</p>
<p>She’s here now with a simple desire to become friends and get along better with me.</p>

<p>“…You’re quite true to your desires, Tsumakawa-san.”</p>
<p>“Hehe. Somehow, I guess?”</p>
<p>“I can see you’re really happy, but I’m not exactly praising you.”</p>

<p>I said that while looking at Tsumakawa with a somewhat ambiguous expression.</p>
<p>Within me, there was a mix of milk-like feelings, thinking how cute it was that she prioritized her own feelings in this moment, and black feelings, thinking it was too self-centered of her to still approach me after I rejected her as a friend.</p>

<p>My emotions were like a café au lait swirling together.</p>
<p>What’s that? It looks delicious.</p>

<p>“…Anyway, the chime is about to ring soon. You should go back to your seat.”</p>
<p>“I wonder if I should just attend the next class in this seat.”</p>

<p>With those words, Tsumakawa remained in her seat next to mine and patted the desk lightly.</p>
<p>By the way, the owner of that seat, Masuda-kun, was looking at Tsumakawa from a distance with a face that seemed like he’d bitten into a bitter bug.</p>
<p>I understand. When an extrovert sits on your own seat without permission, that’s the face you’d make.</p>

<p>“Don’t do it… Don’t make things harder for Masuda-kun.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it better for Masuda-kun to sit in my seat? It’s a win-win situation, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“What’s win-win about it? You’re the only one benefiting, it’s a win-lose situation.”</p>
<p>“Hehe. I’m joking; it’s amusing, though.”</p>
<p>“Alright, alright. It’s funny, please go back to your seat.”</p>
<p>“Hey, don’t brush me off so casually! Gals are sensitive to that kind of treatment because we get brushed off a lot more often! “</p>
<p>“Sensitive to being brushed off, huh? Well, be strong and strive to overcome it.”</p>
<p>“Of course! I’ll live a long and healthy life, just like o-udon noodles!”</p>
<p>“I don’t know, but is Tsumakawa the type to add ‘o’ to udon? It’s kind of cute…”</p>
<p>“Hey, could you not suddenly say things like that? Seriously, it’s creepy!”</p>
<p>“…Sorry. Saying ‘cute’ from a guy like me, who’s an introvert, probably comes off as creepy, huh?”</p>
<p>“N-No, not that… It’s just that pointing out the udon thing is what’s creepy… Anyway, you should say ‘cute’ more often. Say it at least once a day. Actually, just say it again right now, come on!”</p>

<p>As Tsumakawa blushed deeply, she said this while using her clenched fist to playfully rub my shoulder.</p>
<p>Amidst such a conversation, the chime signaling the start of the fourth period rang out.</p>

<p>In response, Tsumakawa stood up from Masuda-kun’s seat, simply said, ‘Then, bye-bye!’ and returned to her own seat, carrying her school bag.</p>
<p>I might get nervous again next time if she suddenly talks to me again.</p>
<p>That’s why, please make sure to schedule an appointment before talking to me next time!</p>
