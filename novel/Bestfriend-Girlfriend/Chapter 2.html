<h3>THE Busybody</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We will now return the answer sheets! As I call your names, come up to the front and get your papers!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It was the day before the end term ceremony.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the morning homeroom, the process of returning the results of the final exams had begun.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Returning the answer sheets was like a death sentence for some and a moment of joy to fulfil their self-esteem for others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gorioka-sensei, the homeroom teacher, read the students&#8217; names in alphabetical order, and the reactions of the students who received their answer sheets were a mix of sadness and joy. Watching the expressions of the students as they received and returned their answer sheets gave a rough idea of how well they had done.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The students were called in order by their names. After the names starting with [A] it was time for those with names starting with [Ka] There was no sign of Kasuya-kun, who should have been called just before me. His suspension still hadn&#8217;t been lifted.</span></p>

<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The soccer club had already been disbanded and if things continued this way, Kasuya-kun would likely end up repeating a year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the way, one of the freshmen who had been suspended along with him ran away from home leaving a note behind and is missing. Lily seemed like she might know something, but I didn&#8217;t inquire about the details.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, skipping over Kasuya-kun, my name was called.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I looked down at my returned answer sheet, a wave of relief washed over me. Thanks to an all-night cram session fueled by a potion from the demon realm, my grades had even improved a bit. Yeah, they were pretty good.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, right after me, it was Kurosawa-san&#8217;s turn. She maintained her aloof expression, giving nothing away.</span></p>

<p><em><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Was it good or bad&#8230;? I can&#8217;t quite tell.’</span></em></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A few people after her were Masaki-chan. She had a big smile on her face. It seemed she had done really well.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And following Masaki-chan was Tashiro-san&#8217;s ex-boyfriend and a judo club member, Hiratsuka-kun. He, too, had a completely expressionless face. Lately, he seemed a bit down. I won&#8217;t mention the reason for that, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Next was Fujiwara-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When her name was called, she energetically replied with a [Yes, yes!] and went to get her answer sheet, returning with a cheerful skip.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Huh? That&#8217;s unexpected&#8230;could it be one of those cases where she seemed like a fool but actually has good grades?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Did you get a pretty good score?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Test scores won&#8217;t matter once we graduate from school, you know.”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh, she&#8217;s just brushing it off.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, even her happy expression&#8230;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Those who have failing grades will have supplementary lessons.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8230;froze at those words from the homeroom teacher.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For those who have failing grades in even one subject, you will attend supplementary lessons every day until August 10th! We&#8217;ll have a makeup test on the 10th, so if you can pass and improve your grades, it might save you from repeating the year!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eeeh, seriously?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Give me a break!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The classroom erupted in an instant commotion. Especially Fujiwara-san, who stood up as if her chair was about to topple and with a voice that resembled a scream, she raised a ruckus.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This is tyranny, Sensei! It&#8217;s tyranny! You&#8217;re taking away half of our summer vacation!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What tyranny? You fool! You&#8217;re getting what you deserve!”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22386378225"></div>
</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, no matter how much she protested, there was no way the supplementary lessons would be cancelled. Fujiwara-san turned her eyes toward me, seeking salvation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;but if I&#8217;m with Fu–min, even during the supplementary lessons…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have scores of 70 or above in all subjects, is there a problem?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu, you traitorrr!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I&#8217;m not even on the line for needing supplementary lessons to begin with.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We-well, Misuzu&#8230; together?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Kurosawa-san, who was sitting in the front row, turned back and waved her hand goodbye.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fueeee&#8230; Masaki-chiiii.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan maintained her smile and made a shooing gesture, as if chasing away a dog.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lately, Masaki-chan has been acting quite strange. I don&#8217;t know who&#8217;s influencing her though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">During lunch break, the four of us – Fujiwara-san, Kurosawa-san, Masaki-chan and I, headed up to the rooftop to have lunch.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Along the way, Fujiwara-san clung to my right arm and pouted.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why do they have to return the test scores first thing in the morning&#8230;Thanks to that, I&#8217;m feeling down all day, Mou–.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But while watching her like that, Masaki-chan, who was clinging to my left arm, cheerfully spoke up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, hey, Fumio-kun! Misuzu-chan! Where should we go to play during summer vacation?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wha!? Masaki-chi! Why does it sound like you&#8217;re leaving me behind to have fun? Isn&#8217;t that mean!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, recently, Masaki-chan has been really difficult. Well, more like dark.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But, despite Fujiwara-san&#8217;s protesting voice, Kurosawa-san, who was walking behind us while gently holding the hem of my shirt, showed a thoughtful gesture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Maybe&#8230; the beach?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Yeah, Kurosawa-san, I don&#8217;t need to answer. Fujiwara-san has teary eyes now.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as we were about to climb the stairs leading to the rooftop, we heard a voice calling out, [Ki, Kijima-sama, Masaki-sama].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Turning around, we saw a petite and adorable girl with distinctive golden hair in vertical curls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The colour of her ribbon indicated that she was a freshman. I vaguely remembered her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She was one of the track and field club members we recently liberated and left as a semi-petite princess in training.</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I believe her name was&#8230;Kayama Yui., if I&#8217;m not mistaken.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Immediately, Fujiwara-san pulled my arm close and shot her a threatening look.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230; what do you want with my Kari-pippi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lately, Fujiwara-san has been quite wary whenever a girl approaches me.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well, I guess I can understand why…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um, well…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Caught in Fujiwara-san&#8217;s intense gaze, Kayama-san stumbled over her words, looking like she was observing a suspicious character.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking over for her, Masaki-chan spoke up.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“This girl is a junior I recently met, Yui Kayama-chan. I called her. I wanted to introduce her to Mai-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To me? Why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s a long story, so let&#8217;s talk while we eat.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, yeah, got it. Well, let&#8217;s head to the rooftop for now.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as we started walking, Kayama-san looked perplexed and said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, um, where should I be held by Kijima-sama?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, there&#8217;s no rule like that.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answered with a straight face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">We finally reached the rooftop, spread out a picnic blanket, and sat in a circle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As everyone unpacked their lunch boxes, it became clear that Kayama-san had nothing with her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You didn&#8217;t bring lunch?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her, she looked troubled.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, with a smile, Masaki-chan said,</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ll just say it since the conversation&#8217;s not moving forward. Yui-chan&#8217;s dad had a business failure and they&#8217;re super poor.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Couldn&#8217;t you phrase it differently!?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Super poor&#8230; that&#8217;s a bit blunt or, well, how should I put it?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Gradually, Masaki-chan&#8217;s severity is becoming hard to hide.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring my awkwardness, Masaki-chan pulled out another lunchbox from her drawstring bag and offered it to Kayama-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I heard you&#8217;re tight on money and skipping lunch, so I made one for you today, Yui-chan. Here you go.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Um&#8230; M-Masaki-sama, is, is that okay?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, of course.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Masaki-chan smiled and reassured the bewildered Kayama-san.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she opened the lid, a cute lunchbox with meatballs and rolled omelettes appeared.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Phew</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">, I&#8217;m relieved. Honestly, I was worried that with Masaki-chan&#8217;s overly cheerful smile, it might contain dog food or something as part of her sadistic tendencies. It seems I was really overthinking it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Without noticing my relieved sigh, Masaki-chan turned her attention to Fujiwara-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, the reason I wanted to introduce her to Mai-chan is because I was wondering if Mai-chan could help her find a part-time job…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A part-time job?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, you see, this girl was originally from a well-off family, so she&#8217;s really naive about the real world. Yesterday, when we happened to meet, she mentioned she was going for a job interview. She showed me the recruitment details&#8230;it&#8217;s paying over 20,000 yen per day, with transportation provided. Beginners welcome. It&#8217;s an easy, high-paying job, and the place is called 『Chiritsu Cosplay Girls Academy』.”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:Chiritsu Kosupure Jogakuin, students&#8217; academy who wear cosplay to give s*x services.]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uwaa…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought she was going for some office job or something…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s quite a coincidence that she ran into Masaki-chan so often. It was a close call.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘But what the heck is Chiritsu&#8230;’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mai-chan, your family runs a bunch of companies, right? I was thinking maybe you could help her find a part-time job…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hahaha&#8230; I see, I get it now. Well then, I&#8217;ll ask my father. Kayama-san, right? Can you give me your contact information?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, um, th-thank you very much. Uh, K-Kijima-sama&#8217;s Oku-sama!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oku-sama!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a brief surprised expression, Fujiwara-san&#8217;s demeanour softened into a more affectionate one.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe&#8230; Is it that obvious? Can you tell?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, uh, I apologise. But it seems you two look really good together&#8230; even though you&#8217;re not married yet.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Masaki-chi! This girl is so lovely! I&#8217;ll do my best to find a good part-time job for her too!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fujiwara-san suddenly became very cheerful.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I was watching. Probably, they had planned it out beforehand. Just before Kayama-san could say 『Kijima-sama&#8217;s Oku-sama』 Masaki-chan gave her a significant wink.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Despite everything, Masaki-chan really does take care of others.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kayama-san seems to have warmed up to Masaki-chan as well, so getting along with her wouldn&#8217;t be a bad thing at all.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong, Shima?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No&#8230; I overslept a little today, so I didn&#8217;t make a bento. I&#8217;ll buy some bread from the cafeteria. Feel free to start eating.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s unusual for Shima to oversleep.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, ahaha…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At home, I had been unable to sleep after witnessing the affair between Hatsune-chan and Kijima. Whenever I closed my eyes, those lascivious scenes would flash behind my eyelids and I would toss and turn all night, helpless to do anything about it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Really&#8230; Whose fault is this?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Muttering so in my heart, I left the classroom. Outside, Takasago, carrying what seemed to be a bento wrapped in a cloth bag, was standing with dropped shoulders in front of the adjacent classroom.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nn? What&#8217;s up, Takasago?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shima-pai. Kan-chan&#8230;wasn&#8217;t here. Together&#8230;for lunch…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shima-pai&#8230; it’s Shima-senpai. But, ah&#8230; I see.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that she had intended to have lunch together, but Kijima wasn&#8217;t in the classroom, so that was apparently what happened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[Well then, how about having lunch with us?] Just as I was about to say that, someone interjected into the conversation from behind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s the matter?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I turned around, there stood a classmate I&#8217;m not particularly fond of.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She currently had her hair in pigtails and wore silver-rimmed glasses that made her seem quite serious.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She can&#8217;t ignore someone in trouble, she can&#8217;t refrain from picking up trash on the ground and if someone&#8217;s shirt is untucked, she&#8217;ll definitely tuck it in for them. If there&#8217;s a skirt length violation, she&#8217;ll accurately detect it with her eyes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The guardian of pure and righteous student life, famously known as 『THE Busybody』.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She is Takata Takaka, the student council member in charge of discipline. It sounds like a joke, but it&#8217;s her real name.</span></p>
<p>[Kanji; 高田 貴佳]</p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My honest reaction was that an annoyance had arrived. For now, I decided to respond casually.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it&#8217;s nothing, really.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“However, it seems like she’s quite downcast over here?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, Takasago muttered with a face that looked like she was about to cry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kan-chan&#8230; wasn&#8217;t here.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kan-chan?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I instinctively scratched my head.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Ugh, seriously, this is a pain in the a*s. Don&#8217;t butt into our business&#8230;Well, whatever, it&#8217;s not like I have to hide this kind of conversation.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kan-chan is referring to Kijima from the next class. This girl has gotten pretty close to Kijima. It seems like she came to eat lunch together, but Kijima wasn&#8217;t here and that&#8217;s the whole story.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kijima&#8230; you mean Fumio Kijima?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that&#8217;s the one. Ahaha&#8230;this guy is totally being fed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I intended to say it jokingly but for some reason, the busybody&#8217;s expression became stern.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That guy again&#8230;to think he&#8217;s ensnaring even seemingly quiet girls! He&#8217;s the source of disciplinary issues. The girls&#8217; being called the Kijima Harem and seems to be getting carried away, he is probably using those girls&#8217; weaknesses to forcibly establish relationships, isn&#8217;t that the case? I&#8217;ve been thinking that he needs to be monitored. I will definitely expose his true nature! “</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, she got excited, but there&#8217;s nothing I can do but be troubled by it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, even if she&#8217;s getting all worked up, picking a fight with him is like jumping into a minefield willingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think it would be better to leave him alone…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Compassion is unnecessary for someone like that!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I mean, that&#8217;s true…”</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘If she starts poking the bushes, what comes out won&#8217;t be just a commotion, but rather a real mess…’</span></i></p>


<h3>Beautiful Girl&#039;s Cream</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As night fell, when I visited the 『Bedroom of the Confinement King』 Kei-chan in her school uniform sat down on the bed, waiting for me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s wrong, Kei-chan?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Lunch&#8230;you weren’t there”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She seemed a bit sulky. When I asked for more details, she explained that she had come to the classroom during lunch break to meet me, but we had missed each other.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, it seems like she begged Tashiro-san and somehow managed to get permission to come here.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kan-chan&#8230;you never play with me at all, you’re awful.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She pouted her lips, and I couldn&#8217;t help but smile wryly.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Even if she says it&#8217;s awful…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In reality, speaking within the hierarchy of the harem, she is more like an apprentice to the secondary favoured princesses and she can&#8217;t possibly take priority over the favoured princesses.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, for some reason when I look at her, I can&#8217;t help but want to pamper her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In a way, she&#8217;s a seductive woman.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Tonight, I have a promise to dote on Kurosawa-san, but still, sending Kei-chan home with just a [okay, goodbye] feels a little pitiful.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Hmm, what should I do&#8230; Wait, hold on?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Actually, earlier today, when I saw Kayama-san getting close to Masaki-chan, I thought about something.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">There are three favoured princesses and three secondary favoured princesses. If that&#8217;s the case, why not have each favoured princess take care of an secondary favoured princess? Not exactly senior and junior in a club, but more like mentors.</span></p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-78347720' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-78347720' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If that&#8217;s the case, Kayama-san is definitely paired with Masaki-chan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The enigmatic and somewhat intimidating Shiratori-san would probably be best taken care of by both Tashiro-san and Shima-san together. She&#8217;s likely too much for just one person to handle.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that case, even though it might sound odd to call them leftovers, it would be perfect for Kurosawa-san and Kei-chan paired up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a while, when I mentioned this idea to Kurosawa-san who had come to the bedroom, she replied with a simple [Sure, that&#8217;s fine] I hadn&#8217;t really been conscious of it, but this kind of response made me realise that she, too, was in a state of submission.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, with that said, I&#8217;d like Kurosawa-san to look after this girl, Takasago Kei.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I introduced her, Kurosawa-san suddenly became more excited.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Huh! Who&#8217;s this? She&#8217;s so cute!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san approached Kei-chan and started poking her cheeks without any hesitation.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aww, so squishy! Your skin is so fair! How? How do you maintain such skin? What kind of skincare do you do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, s-stop…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san pressed on like Fujiwara-san, bombarding Kei-chan with questions. Trying to evade her, Kei-chan answered while pulling away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;I don&#8217;t do anything.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What!? Seriously? And your skin is like this? Seriously!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san seems genuinely surprised, but I think those squishy cheeks are probably the result of an overwhelming amount of sleep.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, if anything happens, make sure to come and talk to me. I&#8217;m like Kei-chan&#8217;s guardian here.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Upon hearing Kurosawa-san&#8217;s words, Kei-chan tilted her head slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then&#8230; Misuzu’s Mama?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just as she said that with an upward gaze, Kurosawa-san let out a staggering sound like she was spewing blood and staggered back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“F-Fumi-kun&#8230; This is bad. This is bad! Something&#8217;s about to overflow.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Something? Like what?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;Affection or drool or something.&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You can&#8217;t put affection and drool on the same level…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fortunately, it seems that Kurosawa-san has taken a liking to Kei-chan and Kei-chan doesn&#8217;t seem to be opposed to it either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">So, without further ado, tonight, I decided that the two of them will be taken care of together.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Merely gazing at the two lying naked on the bed, my own thing was already tightly throbbing with pain.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Somehow, it&#8217;s&#8230;incredible.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Among the girls around me, these two are probably the most deserving of the term [beautiful girls].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, all the other girls are cute and attractive as well, but in terms of well-defined facial features, they still can&#8217;t compete with these two.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kei-chan really likes sweets,right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;&#8230;Un, I do.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, I hastily prepared something like this.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just a while ago, I went to the cafeteria to get it but when Kurosawa-san saw what I had in my hand, she tilted her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Whipped cream and strawberries?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, that&#8217;s right&#8230; like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eek!? It&#8217;s cold! Hey, wait a minute, Fumi-kun!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I climbed onto the bed and squeezed whipped cream onto Kurosawa-san&#8217;s bewildered breasts.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I squeezed it out in a spiral like soft-serve ice cream, and finally topped it with a strawberry.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I can&#8217;t believe it-mouu&#8230; This is so embarrassing, it&#8217;s like something a pervert would do…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Ignoring the blushing girl who lowered her eyebrows in embarrassment, I smiled at Kei-chan.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Go ahead and eat it, Kei-chan.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She nodded slightly, then lay down on top of Kurosawa-san, who was lying on her back, and took a bite of the strawberry, cheeks puffed out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Continuing like that, she extended her tongue towards the whipped cream, licking it up with small licks.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, ah, Kei, Kei-chan, wait, wait a bit…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At first, Kei-chan seemed hesitant in her tongue movements, but the deliciousness of the whipped cream seemed to overcome her hesitation. Her licks became more and more bold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Soon, from under the cream, pink cherry-like nipples were uncovered, and Kei-chan licked them up along with the cream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, ahn, ahh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kei-chan pressed down on Kurosawa-san&#8217;s writhing body, almost as if to keep the plate from moving. Her mouth was already messy and wet. The whipped cream that was perched on the tip of her nose looked oddly cute.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Getting carried away, I squeezed whipped cream onto Kurosawa-san&#8217;s other breast and then onto her stomach. Kei-chan followed after it, running her tongue from her breast to her stomach.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahn, it tickles, Kei-chan, no, ahh…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With Kei-chan&#8217;s tongue movements like that of a small animal, Kurosawa-san shivered slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As if delivering the finishing touch, I let some whipped cream drip onto her groin, and at the touch of the cold cream, Kurosawa-san&#8217;s hips jumped with a surprised [Hyaan!]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kei-chan squatted between Kurosawa-san&#8217;s legs, diligently licking up the whipped cream.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Rero, Rero, slurp, slurp—</span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">the lewd sounds echoed, and as Kei-chan sucked up the cream-covered clitoris into her mouth—</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ahn, ah, ahh, ahn, ahh, aahh, aaahhh!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">—Kurosawa-san arched her back, letting out a high-pitched moan.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A whipped cream play involving two beautiful girls. This was truly something quite arousing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I dripped more whipped cream onto Kurosawa-san&#8217;s intimate area and moved behind Kei-chan, who was busily licking it up. Then, just like that, I covered her and let my fingers trace over her groin.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Funyaaa!!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kei-chan jumps. Regardless, I stroke up her slit and rub her sensitive bud with my drop-wet fingertips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nyaaa! Ah, w-wait, it&#8217;s tickling!? Ah, ah, ah, it’s so sensitive!?”</span></p>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Kei-chan&#8217;s nose was still buried in Kurosawa&#8217;s crotch licking the whipped cream, her body twitched and bounced with little jumps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Funya…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Slowly insert and move a finger into Ke-chan&#8217;s vagina as she begins to move her tongue around again.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Ah, ahh, aaa,ahyih, aaa!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The indecent moans of the two beautiful girls intertwining shamelessly resound.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s about time. I can&#8217;t hold back any longer either.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I smeared whipped cream on my own thing and put it between Kei-chan&#8217;s legs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Grabbing her slender waist, I forcefully thrust the lump of desire covered in whipped cream from behind.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnitsu, ~aasu, it entered……nnyayaa…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her narrow meaty pot is just as narrow as her petite physique. It&#8217;s very wet and slick with whipped cream, but even so, it still tightens around my cock to the point that I want to twist it off.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haaa, Haa…it’s big…Kan-chan fill me up, nigiri&#8230;&#8230; nyaa, ah, ah&#8230;..”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Does it hurt?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I asked her that, Kei-chan shook her head shakily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then there was no need for her to hesitate. I forcefully thrust my dick deep into her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fugyaaaaaaaaahhh!”</span></p>

<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, she arched her body as if a wild horse was neighing, sticking out her cream-covered tongue and letting out a voice reminiscent of a cat that had its tail stepped on.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nyaa! Mmm, ah, ah, hyu, aaaah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Driven by excitement, as I thrust vigorously, the sound of slapping against her buttocks and her gasping cries echoed loudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In the midst of it all, Kurosawa-san, who had finally been released from Kei-chan&#8217;s tongue, managed to lift herself up while catching her breath against her shoulder. Then, with a sly smile, she reached her hands in on both sides of Kei-chan, who continued to moan intensely.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nya, haa? What? Hyaaan! Ah, ah, nya!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kurosawa-san forcefully lifted her down-on-all-fours into a kneeling position and embraced her from the front.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe, Kei-chan, you&#8217;re making such a naughty expression.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kei-chan, now sandwiched between me and Kurosawa-san. Despite Kei-chan&#8217;s bewildered state, Kurosawa-san extended her hand towards me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Fumi-kun, give me some whipped cream.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What? Why?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have to return the favor.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Taking the whipped cream she received, she looked at Kei-chan and provocatively stuck out her tongue, then demonstratively squeezed the cream onto her tongue. And then…</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nmmm!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She sealed Kei-chan&#8217;s lips with her own, then inserted her cream-covered tongue into Kei-chan&#8217;s mouth.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Jyuru, Jyuru, chup, chup.</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kei-chan&#8217;s eyes rolled as she experienced the intense, creamy, yuri kiss. The sight was so sensual that my excitement reached its peak.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With my arousal still strong, I grabbed Kei-chan&#8217;s breasts aggressively and thrust my hips desperately, like a lustful dog in heat.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Driven by impulse, I relentlessly plunged into her depths without mercy, as if repeatedly stabbing into her very core.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nnnnn!? Nnnn!? Kaha! Nnn!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While letting out muffled moans, Kei-chan tapped Kurosawa-san&#8217;s back repeatedly, signalling her to stop, pleading for mercy.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Eventually, Kurosawa-san pulled her lips away and with ragged breaths, a mixture of stirred saliva and whipped cream dripped down onto both of their chests.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘This is&#8230; incredibly erotic…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Witnessing that scene, my already heightened desire caused me to swell even more. Kei-chan was already weak in the knees. However, after being shown such a sight, there was no way I could hold back.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aah, nnya! It&#8217;s intense! Kan-chan, it&#8217;s so intense! Ah, ah, nhaa, nyaggu…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As the point of connection was painfully stretched, every time the flesh was pulled out, the folds of flesh would roll outward.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With each thrust into the depths, the pressure caused the cream-mingled love juices to splash and scatter from the gaps.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Nyaa, ah, hi, coming, it&#8217;s coming so&#8230; ah&#8230; haah, fu&#8230;! Nggh, fuuaaah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kei-chan&#8217;s body was red and flaming as her vagina, full of cream and love juice, was stirred. Her eyes were tormented and debauched and her cream-covered tongue was spilling sloppily out of her half-open mouth.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">From there, I violated the depths of her vagina further, and suddenly Ke-chan shook her head violently.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It seemed that she was about to reach her limit.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hyu~, mmm, ah, hyugo! No! Don&#8217;t&#8230; ya, yara&#8230; more, still, ya, yet I&#8230; nya, fugya! Nigya&#8230; funya, nyaaaaaaa!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can see her desperately resisting pleasure. But even that effort is in vain, as she was engulfed by waves of pleasure.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She widened her eyes and trembled as her body shook.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aah! Ahh! I-I&#8217;m&#8230; cuming! I-I&#8217;m cumming!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, her vagina tightened around my cock, squeezing it even tighter.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Guhh”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I grit my teeth and resist, but even I am at my limit. The hot swirling sensation that had been building up in my lower abdomen rushes up towards the tip, all at once.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Byuu, Byurururururu, Byururu!</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">A hot, milky fluid erupts uncontrollably. Everything in front of me flickers. My whole body trembles with an exquisite pleasure so intense that my consciousness feels like it&#8217;s about to fade away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kuhi!? I-agh! It&#8217;s coming out, it&#8217;s coming out, ngh, aaaaah, aaah!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kei-chan clung to Kurosawa desperately, like a drowning child. And then, with multiple shudders, she entrusted her body to Kurosawa, along with a deep sigh.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She nestled her face into the nape of Kurosawa-san&#8217;s neck, leaning against her. With half-lidded eyes and a dreamy expression, she let out hot breaths from her slightly parted lips.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haah&#8230; haah&#8230; th-that was amazing…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While Kurosawa gently stroked her head, he smiled in my direction.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And so, the three of us, covered in cream, continued to express our love to each other countless times until late into the night.</span></p>

<h3>Do Not Make Noise In Front Of The Staff Room</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The closing ceremony ended in just twenty-five minutes.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of those, fifteen minutes were as usual taken up by the principal&#8217;s speech.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Seated next to me in alphabetical order, Kurosawa, who&#8217;s already sleep-deprived from last night&#8217;s cream-covered play, had her eyes rolled back in a fierce battle against drowsiness induced by the principal&#8217;s hypnotic sound waves.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well&#8230; even though they say she&#8217;s a beautiful girl, I don&#8217;t think that expression works’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, we returned to the classroom, finished homeroom, and by eleven o&#8217;clock, school was out. Finally, the long-awaited summer vacation had arrived.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as the teacher left the classroom, the cheerful ones among us shouted, [Freedom!].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Amidst everyone starting to rustle and stand up, Fujiwara-san leaned in to look at my face.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Masaki-chi will come too, but how about Fu–min join us?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s not a good joke.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If you&#8217;re wondering what it&#8217;s about, it&#8217;s about the part-time job offer from Kayama-san.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">That cunning old man claims he&#8217;ll personally conduct the interviews. I wonder if it&#8217;s appropriate for the head of a leading corporate group in Japan to be conducting interviews for part-time jobs, but he&#8217;s that fond of Fujiwara-san. If it&#8217;s a request from her, he won&#8217;t make it seem bad.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Buuu..…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Fujiwara-san pouted her lips. But, even if she makes that face, some things are just not acceptable.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Just the other day, thanks to Shiratori-san, we managed to escape the clutches of that conniving old man&#8217;s schemes. I can&#8217;t just jump back into the lion&#8217;s den willingly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even after Fujiwara-san and the others left, there were still many people lingering in the classroom, engaged in casual chatter. Perhaps it&#8217;s the slightly fluttery atmosphere that comes with the unique feeling of a long vacation. Many were probably considering going out to have fun after school.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I sat there in a daze for a while, before I knew it, there was no one else in the classroom except me. I checked the clock, it was already 12:15.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oh&#8230; it&#8217;s already past twelve&#8230; well, there&#8217;s no need to panic though’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With my bag in hand, I walked out into the hallway, finding it eerily quiet.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Most of the students must have already gone home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I locked the classroom and, on my way to return the key to the staff room, headed straight to the rooftop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I opened the door leading to the rooftop, I could see the back of a girl looking into the distance over the fence.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Chestnut-coloured hair braided on either side of her head. A ribbon adorning her neckline, the colour of a first-year student.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When she noticed me, she rushed over, intertwining her arm with mine and looking up at me with an upward gaze.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Senpai, you&#8217;re so late! You&#8217;re twenty minutes late! Why do you always, always end up being late? Seriously!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then, I&#8217;m heading home.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wa, wait a second, Senpai! Don&#8217;t be so mean again!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Her name is Rin Fukuda.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even though she had looked quite dishevelled at one point, through the daily summonings and encounters, she had gradually regained her former liveliness.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t you think girls who pout are cute?”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“People who say that about themselves aren&#8217;t cute.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Buu–&#8230; Senpai, you&#8217;re treating me even worse, aren&#8217;t you?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Do you have a complaint?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I shot her a sharp glare, Rin shrank back as if in fear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Mo–&#8230; you&#8217;re always using threats like that…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re noisy. Just hurry up and change.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haah&#8230; you&#8217;re really impatient. Oh, by the way, Senpai, it&#8217;s summer vacation, so how about coming to stay at my dorm?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The dorm? Why’s that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The dining hall has everyone&#8217;s schedules for the dormitory posted and by next week, everyone will have gone back home, leaving only me and one senior from the third year in the dormitory. That senior seems to be busy with summer prep school during the day&#8230;So, what do you say? It&#8217;s a girls&#8217; dorm, you know? A forbidden garden.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The mention of a girls&#8217; dormitory honestly struck a chord with me.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Simply put, I am also interested in the meaning of places that I can&#8217;t usually step into.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, I could visibly see that if I showed a pleased expression, this girl would get carried away.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, I don&#8217;t know if I&#8217;ll stay overnight, but I could show my face when I have some free time.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yatta! Thank you very much, Senpai!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as Rin becomes cheerful, I flutter my hand and urge her, [Hurry up and take off].</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Then, she starts humming and takes off her blouse and bra, leaving only her skirt on her upper body. Of course, she wasn&#8217;t wearing any shorts from the beginning. It&#8217;s because I told her not to.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Blushing with embarrassment and her nose tinged with red, without me even needing to prompt her, she lifts the hem of her skirt and spreads her legs.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8230;Rin Fukuda, am Senpai Kijima&#8217;s live masturbatory aid. I can&#8217;t help but crave Senpai&#8217;s splendid manhood. Please, to your heart&#8217;s desire, thrust into Rin&#8217;s female hole.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Honestly, you&#8217;re quite vulgar.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuuu…..You make me say it myself, and then you criticise my choice of words&#8230; Isn&#8217;t that a bit too much?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Shut up.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Foreplay isn&#8217;t necessary and I have no intention of doing it. This woman is nothing more than a tool for masturbation and nothing less.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Guiding her towards a bench, I take out my cock and move behind Rinko.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And at that very moment when it&#8217;s aimed towards her groin—</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">Kasha! </span></i><span style="font-weight: 400">A sound reminiscent of a smartphone camera shutter echoes through the quiet rooftop.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432882121"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My spine involuntarily freezes. I hastily look around, and from behind the door, holding a smartphone with a notably displeased expression, there&#8217;s a girl glaring at me.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Silver-framed glasses, a pursed mouth—there&#8217;s certainly a familiar face on her unmistakably serious countenance.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The uptight one from the next class over. The disciplinary committee chair, Takata Takaka.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I&#8217;ve got evidence. There&#8217;s no way you can talk your way out of this now! Honestly&#8230; to think you were such a perverted guy, reaching out even to underclassmen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Wa-wait a second! Takaka-san!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I won&#8217;t wait! I&#8217;m reporting this to the teacher.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, she glances over at Rin. Her gaze is icy cold.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Really&#8230; just when I thought a scumbag was preying on any girl he could, it turns out the girls are scumbags too. You two deserve to be dealt with together!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No way&#8230; Takaka-senpai, I&#8230;!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No room for discussion.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With a forceful push, she closes the door and leaves the rooftop.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Trembling, Rin collapses from her knees, and I quickly tuck myself and chase after Takaka-san.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘&#8230;There&#8217;s no choice but to do it.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The school has been hit by a series of scandals covered by the media. It&#8217;s even said that the school&#8217;s recruitment for next year is at risk. Moreover, four freshmen from the track team remain missing, and the embers of the abduction case continue to smoulder.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Of course, I don&#8217;t want to destroy the school either, so I hadn&#8217;t planned on causing a commotion for a while. However, now that things have come to this point, there&#8217;s no avoiding a difficult situation.</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, once I&#8217;ve detained someone, I can&#8217;t just let them go for free. Frankly, that stern glasses-wearing girl doesn&#8217;t interest me in the slightest.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I can hear footsteps, so I rush down the stairs. They&#8217;re headed straight towards the first floor. She&#8217;s probably planning to burst into the staff room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">By the time I manage to catch up, Takaka-san is about to put her hand on the staff room door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I forcefully press down on the partially opened door and raise my voice towards her.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takaka-san, just wait a moment, listen to me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have no ears to listen! Disgusting! Let go of me!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If you come in here, it&#8217;ll be bad, seriously!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re so annoying!”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She shoves me and immediately dashes into the room as soon as she opens the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, puzzled voices leak from inside the door.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-What&#8217;s this? What&#8217;s going on?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Well, that&#8217;s understandable. Anyone would be surprised if they jumped into a dark stone room, thinking it was the staff room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In fact, I had set up a door that connects to the 『room』 right behind the staff room door, while pretending to prevent her from opening it.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, see you later.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-wait a second!”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I have no ears to listen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I toss back the words she had just said moments ago, then close the door, ignoring her confusion. I took a deep breath as I shrug my shoulders slightly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I did say it would be bad, didn&#8217;t I?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Almost as I mutter that, the staff room door opens, and Kobayashi-sensei peers out.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">He&#8217;s the homeroom teacher from the adjacent class, a young male teacher who was transferred here just last year.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s all the commotion about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, it&#8217;s not me. There was a foolish commotion-maker, and I just gave them a little warning.”</span></p>

<h3>Changing Home</h3>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Back on the rooftop, Rin had put her clothes on and was sitting on a bench.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">She looked up at the sky blankly, her eyes following the clouds.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Deliberately closing the door with a loud noise, she flinched.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Senpaaiiii…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why are you making that almost-crying face?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry. After a good talk, she understood.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-3' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_1/article_incontent_1 -->
<div data-fuse="22386378216"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Understood&#8230; What are you talking about?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Many things. Anyway, I got her to promise not to go crying to the teacher.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that, Rin stood up from the bench and scratched the air anxiously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“N-No way!? Y-You mean that Takata Takaka!? You managed to convince that uptight person?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, surprisingly, she&#8217;s not so bad.Takaka-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Rin leaned against the bench, breathing out a huge sigh of relief.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s a relief&#8230;If we ended up leaving school together, we&#8217;d go on a love escapade. Living off the land deep in the mountains of Okuhida, until our third baby is born&#8230; I&#8217;ve already simulated it all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“There are too many things to point out, but first of all, why Okuhida?”</span></p><div class='ai-viewports ai-viewport-3 ai-insert-4-20059109' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;' data-insertion-position='prepend' data-selector='.ai-insert-4-20059109' data-insertion-no-dbg data-code='PGRpdiBjbGFzcz0nY29kZS1ibG9jayBjb2RlLWJsb2NrLTQnIHN0eWxlPSdtYXJnaW46IDhweCBhdXRvOyB0ZXh0LWFsaWduOiBjZW50ZXI7IGRpc3BsYXk6IGJsb2NrOyBjbGVhcjogYm90aDsnPgo8IS0tIDcxMTYxNjMzL2FydGljbGVfaW5jb250ZW50XzIvYXJ0aWNsZV9pbmNvbnRlbnRfMiAtLT4KPGRpdiBkYXRhLWZ1c2U9IjIyMzg2Mzc4MjE5Ij48L2Rpdj4KPC9kaXY+Cg==' data-block='4'></div>



<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Senpai seems to like it, doesn&#8217;t it? It sounds kind of naughty. Okuhida.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Apologise to everyone living in Gifu Prefecture!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Aaa, so it&#8217;s in Gifu Prefecture, I see. I thought it was the top pointy area of Hokkaido, because of [oku].. well…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8217;re taking it too far!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I sighed in disbelief, Rin let out another relieved breath.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I really didn&#8217;t know what to do. The other person I mentioned earlier, the one staying in the dorms, is actually that Takata Takaka-senpai.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The one who&#8217;s skipping home because of summer prep school?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You&#8230;you actually suggested staying in the dorms when she’s still around?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I thought it would be fine as long as we weren&#8217;t caught&#8230; and, well, lately I&#8217;ve been completely ignored anyway.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">But hearing that was actually a good thing.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">If I handle this well, I might be able to keep the fact that I detained someone hidden for a while.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Takaka-san had a family emergency back home, and she said she&#8217;s changing her plans and going back today. Your dorm posted the summer break plans, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uh, yes, in the dormitory dining area…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Could you change that? Make it say she&#8217;ll be away on a home visit until the last day of summer vacation.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-6' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, sure, I guess.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin nodded with a face that still didn&#8217;t seem quite convinced.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I couldn&#8217;t bring myself to embrace Rin any further today, so I only made a promise to visit her dormitory and returned home.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Rin seemed quite dissatisfied, though.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I arrived home a little after three in the afternoon. When I got back to my room, as usual, Lili was floating in the air, engrossed in reading a manga.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Welcome back, Devi. You&#8217;re home unusually early today, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, it was just the closing ceremony&#8230;and there were a few things”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A few things?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">When I explained the situation, as usual, Lili made a bewildered expression.</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-7' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Devi, I didn&#8217;t expect you to suddenly make a detour, especially when the next target is already decided.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It can&#8217;t be helped, right?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, whatever, Devi. For now, go to Freesia and have that Takata girl bring some of her belongings from the dormitory. That way, we can fake a homecoming appearance.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;ll be helpful.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But from what I&#8217;ve heard, that girl is quite interesting as material. During the summer break, we can use her as a practice subject for brainwashing and training, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Interesting? How so? In reality, she&#8217;s just an unsociable girl with single eyelids and plain looks, not to mention that inflexible personality of hers. There&#8217;s nothing really appealing about her.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this point, Lili showed a somewhat contemplative gesture.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then&#8230; What if that girl were to start begging for Fu–min&#8217;s cock and even go as far as kneeling down?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">&#8220;That&#8230; would be a bit interesting.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I said that, Lili smiled mischievously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Alright, let&#8217;s start planning the brainwashing right away, Devi. Isn&#8217;t that girl uptight and even takes it upon herself to discipline other students?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yeah, that&#8217;s right.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Is she disliked by other students, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230; yeah, I guess so.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A role that doesn&#8217;t work out well, Devi. Why does she do things that make her disliked? What merit does that girl get from it?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-9' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eh, merit? I&#8217;m not sure&#8230;maybe it&#8217;s about gaining the teacher&#8217;s favour, which could be advantageous for exams…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“If not getting on the teacher&#8217;s good side would result in grades that can&#8217;t even support passing the exams, Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I shook my head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I think she was way ahead of me. She might have been in the top ten of the class.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In that case, there&#8217;s one conceivable merit, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8217;s that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s because it&#8217;s 『comfort』 Devi. Behaving stiffly and imposing that stiffness on others comes naturally to her. Do you understand why?”</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:楽; I decide to use comfort rather than easy.]</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Like a label? Being raised being told she&#8217;s serious?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I answer while recalling the time with Tashiro-sam. She was labelled as an excellent and dignified person, and as a result, she started behaving that way&#8230; That was the story.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, Lili shook her head.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Actually, the opposite. She should have been raised being called careless by her parents.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What?! How can they call that careless…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“No, it&#8217;s different, Devi. It&#8217;s not that she&#8217;s careless now, but rather, she became like that as a result of being excessively suppressed. Due to oppressive parents fitting her into a mould, behaving stiffly became natural for her. And then, enforcing that behaviour onto others…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At that point, Lili pointed her finger right in front of my nose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She&#8217;s seeking revenge, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“&#8230;Sorry, I don&#8217;t understand.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, Devi, humans are creatures moulded by habits. Regardless of personal preferences, if a habit forms, that state becomes『easier』 The girl who has been forced to live stiffly since she was young, for her, that stiff state becomes 『comfort』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s just too unpleasant.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, it&#8217;s a common pattern, Devi. But on the other hand, even though she feels so suppressed herself, she also senses the inequality that others aren&#8217;t like that. So, unconsciously, she tries to enforce it onto her surroundings.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But she&#8217;s supposedly living in a dormitory, so once she&#8217;s away from her parents, wouldn&#8217;t the suppression go away?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“She might have thought that initially, Devi. But unfortunately, that&#8217;s not possible.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Have you ever heard a story about someone winning the lottery and becoming a millionaire, only to quickly spend it all and end up back as a poor person? Have you never heard of someone succeeding in a diet but quickly reverting to their previous weight?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, yeah…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">It&#8217;s not an uncommon story. In fact, it often feels like success and rebound are almost a package deal.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s because the state of being poor or overweight is 『home』 while being a millionaire or being thin is 『away』 Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Human beings have a function called 『homeostasis maintenance』. Essentially, it&#8217;s a function that tries to return to a normal state even when there&#8217;s some abnormality. Thanks to this, even if humans have a fever, they return to normal body temperature and don&#8217;t go below it, Devi. And this function works in the same way for 『behavior』.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-weight: 400">[TL:Homeostasis maintenance;The tendency to maintain a stable, relatively constant internal environment]</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, in other words, being in a poor or overweight state is considered normal and it naturally tries to return there?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, exactly. Changing a firmly established 『home』 is an incredibly challenging task, Devi. For that girl too, since the state of 『behaving stiffly』 is considered normal, even if she tries to stop it, she&#8217;ll ultimately return to that state.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230; If that&#8217;s the case, then what do you do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili puffed out her chest and let out a self-assured snort.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“You make it so that even if she wants to go back, she can&#8217;t. You gradually force a change in her 『home』 over time. To a flashy, irredeemably vulgar gal to a lewd woman who adores Fu-min&#8217;s cock. All the way until that stiff eyeglasses-wearing 『home』  changes.”</span></p>
