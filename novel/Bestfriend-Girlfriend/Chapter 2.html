<h1>Chapter 2: 6 Main Heroines Who Absolutely Want to Monopolize Me</h1>

<p>In front of me is a red-carpeted virgin road.</p>
<p>When I turn around, I can overlook the late afternoon Tokyo cityscape beyond the glass.</p>
<p>Minato-ku, Tokyo. Standing right in the middle is the ‘Roppongi Sky Tower,’ a 66-story ultra-high-rise building that was completed on June 6th, just last month, named after the Roppongi area.</p>

<p>The newspaper mentioned that prominent major companies were competing for its tenancy rights, but the rooftop and the top six floors from 61st to 66th were shrouded in mystery, and no one knew who bought them.</p>
<p>However, when I opened the lid, it seemed that…</p>

<p>“So, does that mean my mother’s company bought this…?”</p>

<p>Juujo-san nods.</p>

<p>“Yes. Kaede-sama decided to make the purchase, and the plan for constructing the building began ten years ago. Currently, it is the property of this Love Study Abroad Program.”</p>
<p>“Seriously…”</p>
<p>“Yes, it’s true. Now, let me explain the future flow right away.”</p>

<p>Ignoring my surprise, Juujo-san began to explain.</p>

<p>“Shinichi-sama, from now on, you will be meeting six bride candidates.”</p>
<p>“Bride candidates, you say?”</p>

<p>Hearing it again, it’s quite an amazing word…</p>

<p>“For Shinichi-sama, you will eliminate one person periodically from these six bride candidates in order to ultimately choose only one person.”</p>
<p>“Eliminate…?”</p>
<p>“Yes. In this program, you will eliminate them one by one… meaning you’ll go on dates and gradually narrow it down until only one person remains, and then you will become engaged to her. That’s the rule.”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>…Well, the rules leading up to that point may not matter much since the final choice of one person is still the same.</p>
<p>But somehow, I can’t help but feel unsure about it.</p>

<p>“Is it not acceptable to not choose only one person in the end? Making them go through eliminations one by one feels a bit cruel…”</p>
<p>“Shinichi-sama is a compassionate person, it seems.”</p>
<p>“Not really…”</p>

<p>I gently bite my lower lip. Being compassionate means that I tend to accumulate ‘baggage’ and ‘obligations.’ It’s not ideal.</p>
<p>For some reason, Juujo-san smiles slightly.</p>

<p>“…Let’s get back on track. Shinichi-sama, when I say, ‘Just choose one person in the end,’ do you think there’s a reason to let those who didn’t score enough in the first round of a company interview or a school entrance exam proceed to the second round?”</p>
<p>“…Alright, I understand somehow.”</p>

<p>That’s right. I need to discern the person I’ll spend my life with.</p>
<p>In that case, it would make sense to eliminate candidates who have no chance of marrying early on, reduce the number, and then carefully observe the remaining candidates to minimize the possibility of making the wrong judgment.</p>

<p>“I’m glad you understand. Now, I will bring each candidate one by one, and you can briefly introduce yourselves and get to know each other. I would like to remind you that the candidates have auditioned based on your profile, Shinichi-sama. So, it would be best to focus on getting to know them rather than talking too much about yourself.”</p>
<p>“Audition…?”</p>
<p>“That’s right. Around 10,000 women of the same age as you, after seeing your profile, applied. From that pool, the six women who passed have gathered here.”</p>
<p>“10,000!?”</p>

<p>It’s impossible for a girl I’ve never met to have romantic feelings for me, so I understand it’s based on my family background or my position as the heir to the future company president, but still, that’s a lot.</p>

<p>“By the way, when did all of this start?”</p>
<p>“About the past two months, secretly, until last week. The Four Heavenly Kings of the Marriage Matching Specialists representing Verite comprehensively judged family background, abilities, and more importantly, Shinichi-sama’s compatibility, and only those who exceeded high standards in all aspects were invited here.”</p>
<p>“The Four Heavenly Kings…”</p>

<p>This seemingly joking system must have been created by my mother.</p>

<p>“From these carefully selected six bride candidates, your task in this Love Study Abroad is to choose that one person.”</p>
<p>“And then, to marry or be engaged to that one.”</p>
<p>“Yes. After the self-introductions, I will explain the process further when all of you are present.”</p>
<p>“Got it.”</p>

<p>It’s hard to take in everything at once, but it seems that I am supposed to choose one person from the six who will be coming here.</p>

<p>“Now then, first, I will call in the first person.”</p>

<p>Juujo-san deeply bows and leaves, leaving me alone on the red carpet.</p>

<p>I gently close my eyes and focus.</p>
<p>I need to choose one person through this study abroad program, but it’s not just about selecting someone I like.</p>
<p>I must choose someone I can be with until death do us part, quite literally.</p>

<p>Suddenly, I recall my mother’s words from a dream.</p>

<p>【Shinichi, ‘true love’ refers to a relationship where ‘interests align’.】</p>

<p>…I see, in this situation, it strangely makes sense.</p>
<p>If our interests align indefinitely, there would be no reason for divorce even if our romantic feelings were to fade away.</p>

<p>“…Alright.”</p>

<p>I quietly gather my resolve.</p>
<p>And thus, the evaluation to determine the unknown ‘her’ begins.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Ria Meguro</strong></p>

<p>The first candidate: Ria Meguro.</p>

<p>“Seriously?”</p>

<p>She appears at the chapel entrance, adorned in a peach-coloured dress and beaming with a dazzling smile.</p>
<p>I can hardly believe my eyes.</p>
<p>With a sweet smile on her face, she introduces herself.</p>

<p>“Hi, hello! ♡ I’m Ria Meguro, 15 years old, a first-year high school student from Saitama Prefecture! My favourite animal is a capybara! Call me Ria, nice to meet you! ♡”</p>
<p>“…hello, I’m Shinichi Hirakawa, 17 years old, a second-year high school student. My favourite animal… well, it doesn’t really matter.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, that’s funny! ♡ Do you know, you seem like you’d make a great idol!”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t think so…”</p>

<p>I can see it myself. What awkward communication this is!</p>
<p>I had been telling myself to remain calm and composed, but my heart’s protective barrier wavered immediately.</p>

<p>However, I think it’s only natural for me to be a bit like this.</p>
<p>After all, standing before me is the centre of the top idol group 『Harumeku Pleats』 Ria Meguro, whose fame in Japan is so immense that even someone as oblivious to the entertainment industry as I am would have a hard time not knowing her.</p>
<p>Her name often appears on the front page of newspapers that I see while working part-time as a newspaper delivery person, and if I walk down the street, I can see her in various advertisements around the city.</p>
<p>It is no exaggeration to say that even her unique self-address, 『Rii』, is known by the whole nation.</p>
<p>Even during the graduation ceremony, when my classmates were talking about idols, it was Ria Meguro.</p>

<p>…No, wait.</p>

<p>“Weren’t you supposed to have suddenly graduated? Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“Rii graduated to come here, you know? ♡”</p>
<p>“Graduated to come here…?”</p>

<p>While I was dumbfounded, she gently held my hand and said with a million-point smile,</p>

<p>“To be in a romantic relationship with you, Shinichi-kun ♡.”</p>
<p>“Romantic relationship…with me…?”</p>

<p>In response, all I could manage was a zero-point nod (a mere repetition).</p>

<p>“Yeah! Idols are not allowed to fall in love, right? But Rii fell in love with you, Shinichi-kun! That’s why Rii quit being an idol and came here! ♡”</p>
<p>“In love? With me? From which aspect…?”</p>
<p>“That’s a lot of questions, huh? Well, where should I start…? Maybe everything, perhaps? ♡ Your sleepy eyes are cool, and you’re really smart since you seem to be studying hard. You don’t have many friends, but you seem single-minded.”</p>

<p>Is that supposed to be a compliment?</p>
<p>No way, I can’t believe this Ria Meguro could like me in any way.</p>
<p>No, wait.</p>

<p>“But even if that were true, is it really possible for someone to quit being an idol for such a reason?”</p>
<p>“To turn that question around, Shinichi-kun. This Rii…”</p>

<p>Suddenly, a cold intensity glimmers in her smiling eyes.</p>

<p>“Do you really think this Ria Meguro graduated from HaruPuri as a joke?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>Her eyes were fixed on me.</p>

<p>“There is no way, right? ♡ Right now, I want you to understand that Rii came here with that much determination!”</p>
<p>“I, I see…”</p>

<p>I try to return a gaze, wanting to gather as much information as possible, but her idol-like radiance that appeared in her eyes makes me want to look away.</p>
<p>It’s too dazzling for a loner at an all-boys school like me.</p>

<p>I close my eyes and take a deep breath.</p>
<p>This is my routine for concentration, which I always do before studying.</p>
<p>I call it the ‘2-Second Meditation.’</p>

<p>Phew… Alright…</p>

<p>“What’s wrong? ♡”</p>
<p>“Oh, it’s nothing.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Your face was red before, but it’s back to normal now.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I guess so.”</p>

<p>I’m glad I mastered the 2-Second Meditation…</p>

<p>“Anyway, let’s…”</p>

<p>As Ria says that, she leans closer to me and give me a hug.</p>

<p>“…Huh?! R-Ria…?!”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? ♡”</p>

<p>Looking up at me with that charming smile, I feel my heart swaying, even though I know it’s her idol persona manipulating me.</p>
<p>As expected of an idol captivating one hundred million people… No, wait…</p>
<p>A warning alarm goes off in my mind.</p>

<p>This is bad. She’s getting too physically close.</p>
<p>She’s exceeding my tolerance level.</p>

<p>“Hmm? ♡”</p>

<p>This is no good; she’s probably going to stay like this no matter what I say.</p>
<p>I’m going to do the 2-Second Meditation again.</p>

<p>…Alright.</p>
<p>With a calm expression, I look back at Ria.</p>

<p>“Mhm…! You’re a tough one, huh? When Rii gazes at any boy for six seconds, their face turns red, you know?”</p>

<p>Saying that, Ria puffs out her cheeks in a flirtatious manner.</p>

<p>“Anyway, wait and see, Rii will definitely make you fall in love with me! ♡”</p>
<p>“Uh, I’ll take up that challenge… (?)”</p>

<p>“It’s time.”</p>

<p>Juujo-san rings the bell, signalling the end of Ria’s turn.</p>

<p>“Let’s talk again later, Shinichi-kun! ♡”</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sakiho Shinagawa</strong></p>

<p>Second candidate: Sakiho Shinagawa.</p>

<p>“And thus, Sakiho Shinagawa, 16 years old, second-year high school student, came here to marry Shinichi for real!”</p>

<p>My childhood friend, who always appears with her usual smile, is dressed up more than usual and introduces herself in her usual tone.</p>

<p>“As expected, Sakiho already knew about this study abroad, huh?”</p>
<p>“Isn’t it common sense that I should know about this?”</p>
<p>“It’s not a common sense, Sakiho is just unreasonable…”</p>

<p>I had already expected Sakiho to come when I received the invitation to the Love Study Abroad.</p>

<p>『Anyway, there’s an even bigger surprise. Not from me, though. It’s a huge surprise present for you from someone else.』</p>
<p>『Hmm, I tried to oppose it, to be honest. But, you know, when the sender is the sender…』</p>

<p>With Sakiho knowing about this study abroad, all the mysterious remarks from yesterday make sense.</p>

<p>“Sigh… Sakiho really knows everything, huh?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know everything. Just about you, Shinichi.”</p>

<p>Sakiho says that with a smug expression again.</p>

<p>“By the way, why do you have such a satisfied look on your face? Were you that happy that I came?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s just that when I see Sakiho, I feel at ease.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Ehehe…”</p>

<p>Sakiho had a bashful smile in response to my words.</p>

<p>“…No? That’s not it.”</p>

<p>But suddenly, she gives me a suspicious look.</p>

<p>“Shinichi, you looked like you were being charmed by the first girl, didn’t you?! You had the same face after somehow avoiding the beautiful newspaper sales lady when she came to the house before!”</p>

<p>She figured it out…! Wait a second!</p>

<p>“But back then, Sakiho, you weren’t at my home. How did you see my face?”</p>
<p>“Seeing that is an obvious, natural thing to happen.”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>What was I even saying about feeling at ease when I saw Sakiho?</p>
<p>It’s the complete opposite!</p>

<p>“Anyway, for Shinichi to agree to this talk…Isn’t marriage a ‘huge burden’ for you?”</p>
<p>“Well, I guess… Were you surprised?”</p>
<p>“No. If it was Shinichi, I thought you’d take it if it was for your dream. That’s why I didn’t like it. I’m always here for you if you simply need a marriage partner.”</p>

<p>Sakiho continues to ramble on as usual, and I decide to ask her something I’ve been thinking about.</p>

<p>“If it were to happen, would you really be okay with that, Sakiho?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong? You suddenly have such a serious expression.”</p>
<p>“Because it’s a serious topic. It’s about Sakiho’s future, okay?”</p>
<p>“Hmm…?”</p>

<p>Until now, Sakiho has always conveyed her feelings in a playful manner.</p>
<p>Perhaps she knew that as a minimalist in interpersonal relationships, I would never seriously respond to her approach.</p>

<p>Even if she doesn’t know everything, she should know everything about me, given that she is Sakiho.</p>

<p>However, this love study abroad is not just child’s play.</p>
<p>If chosen, she has to genuinely marry me.</p>
<p>That’s why I need to confirm her intentions.</p>

<p>“Does Sakiho really have the intention to marry me?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do. You should already know that.”</p>

<p>Sakiho immediately responds.</p>

<p>“Huh? Haven’t I said it so many times before? That I have a ‘first love supremacist’ principle?”</p>

<p>That has always been her assertion.</p>

<p>“I know that, but…”</p>
<p>” ‘I know that, but I don’t understand,’ is that what you’re saying? Well, let me explain it again since it’s the last time.”</p>

<p>Saying that, she clears her throat.</p>
<p>The highlight fades away from her eyes.</p>

<p>Have I unintentionally pressed that switch…?</p>

<p>“I don’t just have an unfounded ‘first love supremacist’ belief. There are clear reasons and evidence behind the belief that being with your first love is the happiest. It’s very simple. Because ‘the first love is the standard for everything.’…”</p>

<p>At this point, there’s no room for doubt I pressed that switch.</p>

<p>“…If, hypothetically, I were to date someone other than Shinichi in the future… Ahhh, just thinking about it makes me feel sick and nauseous. But since Shinichi doesn’t seem to understand, I’ll reluctantly make this assumption. It’s purely hypothetical, imaginary, and impossible——no, I shouldn’t even entertain such thoughts, but can you listen to me with that understanding?”</p>

<p>Sakiho, in a dress, approaches me slowly; it feels like a scene from a psycho-horror movie.</p>

<p>“If I were to date someone other than you, Shinichi, I’d end up thinking about you whenever I’m with that person. I’d compare how you’d react in this situation, comparing how you’d hold me, comparing the feeling of your lips… I’d keep doing that, over and over, forever! So, if I have the choice, I’d rather marry my first love and experience all the ‘firsts’ with that person. Sometimes people say things like, ‘The first person you date might not be your soulmate, so date different people to find out.’ But I don’t understand the desire to date various people and be selective. Because…”</p>

<p>Probably running out of breath, she takes a quick breath and declares.</p>

<p>“I want to give everything from my ‘first’ to my ‘last’ to you.”</p>
<p>“Sakiho, okay. I understand, so…!”</p>

<p>Overwhelmed by the amount of information, the content, and the atmosphere, I try to stop her by pressing on Sakiho’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Really? You really understand?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I do.”</p>

<p>I’m not lying. At this moment, that’s how I feel, or at least that’s what I think.</p>

<p>My concern lies not in Sakiho’s current feelings but in the question of whether the magic of love will eventually wear off.</p>
<p>Trying to find a meaningful answer here would be futile.</p>
<p>Perhaps I can only clarify such matters in the future during the rest of the love study abroad.</p>

<p>“Actually, I’m already making quite a concession, and I’m enduring a lot. I feel frustrated that my feelings, which I’ve conveyed with my life on the line, aren’t getting through. I’m upset that you’re looking for a bride even though I’m right here. I want you to understand that too.”</p>

<p>Sakiho, who is usually lighthearted, now speaks with emotions laid bare.</p>

<p>“Well, for now, I’ll let you participate in this study abroad. But after we get married, make sure not to have eyes for anyone else. It’s to engrave in your memory that you chose me out of your own will.”</p>
<p>“Sakiho…”</p>
<p>“I’m not going to lose, okay?”</p>

<p>Saying that, she blossoms into a radiant smile.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Maion Hirakawa</strong></p>

<p>Third candidate: Maion Hirakawa.</p>

<p>The third one was a petite girl with a small face and beautiful silver hair, dressed in a pure white dress.</p>

<p>“Maion?!”</p>

<p>Seeing her, I can’t help but let out a loud voice.</p>
<p>She’s someone I know again, but it’s not just a simple acquaintance.</p>

<p>“It’s been a while, big brother.”</p>

<p>Her name is Maion Hirakawa, and she used to be my step-sister.</p>
<p>Though calling her a step-sister is not entirely accurate, as she is not my father’s remarriage partner’s child.</p>

<p>My father took in Maion through adoption from a foster home.</p>
<p>The reason my father adopted her seemed to be because of her exceptional intelligence.</p>
<p>Back when she was still in the foster home as an elementary school student, Maion attempted to hack into the internal network of the Hirakawa Group.</p>

<p>Though the exact reason why the quiet Maion at the time would try something like that remained unclear.</p>
<p>Instead of taking legal action against Maion or the foster home, my father, Shinnosuke Hirakawa, offered to adopt her, using that incident as a reason.</p>

<p>Looking back, my father might have already given up on making me the company’s successor at that time and was searching for alternative candidates.</p>
<p>And so, during my fourth year of elementary school, I suddenly gained a younger sister, Maion Hirakawa.</p>

<p>“Maion, why are you here!?”</p>
<p>“It doesn’t matter, I always knew I would have to marry you someday, big brother. The time simply has come.”</p>
<p>“…Did Maion like me?”</p>
<p>“That’s inexplicable. How is that possible?”</p>
<p>“…why wouldn’t it be possible?”</p>

<p>Although not very similar siblings, we still frown and tilt our heads in the same way.</p>
<p>However, despite living in the same house for six years until I left for high school, I still can’t quite grasp what Maion is saying sometimes.</p>
<p>Well, it did take her a whole year to start speaking in front of me, so I guess it’s not surprising.</p>

<p>“Following that logic, all participants in this study abroad would have to like you, big brother. Do you really think that’s possible?”</p>
<p>“That’s true…”</p>

<p>After all, most of the audition applicants must have been interested in my family background and position, so it’s more likely that the six successful candidates have no romantic interest in me.</p>
<p>Unconsciously, I must have made quite a conceited remark.</p>
<p>I clear my throat as if to cover up my embarrassment and return to the initial question.</p>

<p>“So, what about you, Maion? What was your purpose for participating?”</p>
<p>“Maion cannot change her current environment. To do so, she need to be supported by the Hirakawa family.”</p>

<p>Maion refers to herself by her name most of the time.</p>
<p>She does so because her name is the only thing she received from her birth parents, or so she says.</p>
<p>By the way, it took her three years to tell me this.</p>

<p>“Maion became a foster child of the Hirakawa family under the condition that she can pursue what she likes for herself. You could call it a contract with the Hirakawa family. However, it’s not too far off for Father Shinnosuke to retire from being the president or chairman.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p>I don’t know if the concept of retirement applies to that man, but my father is almost 60, and even if he doesn’t retire, life has its limits.</p>

<p>“So, Maion believed she must marry her big brother before that time comes.”</p>
<p>“I see… But what exactly is it that Maion wants to do so badly?”</p>

<p>In truth, it has been 7 and a half years since we met, and I haven’t been able to get her to talk about her goal.</p>

<p>“Maion wants…”</p>

<p>Though it may sound conceited, Maion has opened up to me in her own way.</p>
<p>But this is something we’ve never talked about before.</p>
<p>At this crucial moment when we might consider getting married, it’s an important matter.</p>
<p>She seemed hesitant whether to say it or not, but still, she leaned in and whispered into my ear like confiding a secret with her older brother about her first love, saying, [It’s a secret, okay?]</p>

<p>“Maion wants to make dolls…”</p>
<p>“Oh, really…”</p>

<p>Upon hearing those words, a delightful feeling spread through my chest.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand. Why do you have such a happy expression on your face?”</p>
<p>“Well… It’s just that it’s the first time I’ve heard about this side of Maion. I see, so you like that kind of thing…”</p>
<p>“I-It’s not that I like it! A-and don’t suddenly look at me like that, big brother. It’s incomprehensible…”</p>

<p>Maion’s fair face turns slightly pink.</p>
<p>It looks beautiful against her silver hair and pure white dress, and her acting tsundere about her own dream is somehow adorable.</p>

<p>“I see, cutting your hair was also for this study abroad?”</p>
<p>“Yes, it was… do you think it doesn’t suit me?”</p>

<p>Maion looks at the ends of her hair cut around her shoulders and frowns.</p>
<p>It used to be quite long, almost touching the floor. She seems to have cut it quite a lot.</p>

<p>Maion attends a private school where remote commuting is allowed for both middle and high school, and she was mostly a shut-in, letting her hair grow without much care for her appearance.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, her hair, which is probably inherited from her parents, was always beautifully maintained.</p>
<p>Occasionally, when she opened the window of her third-floor room and looked down at the city, people passing by would see her and give her the nickname ‘Silver-Haired Rapunzel.’</p>

<p>“Well, the short hair suits you too. I almost thought you were making your high school debut.”</p>

<p>It may be biased as her brother, but I think she looks on par with the top idol, Ria Meguro, whom I saw earlier.</p>

<p>“High school debut? Why would Maion do that?”</p>
<p>“Well, I don’t know… maybe to become popular with guys at school?”</p>
<p>“It’s puzzling. I don’t understand why Maion would want someone at high school to like her…After all…”</p>

<p>And then, my sister casually drops a bombshell.</p>

<p>“In Maion’s high school, there is no big brother.”</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Yuu Shibuya</strong></p>

<p>Fourth candidate: Yuu Shibuya.</p>

<p>“Hello! I’m Yuu Shibuya!”</p>
<p>“Hello, I’m Shinichi Hirakawa, 17 years old, a high school student.”</p>
<p>“Hey, who came up with this amazing Love Study Abroad program? You? Your dad? Your mom? Or that Juujo person?”</p>

<p>Even before properly introducing herself, or rather, not even coming close to introducing herself, she brings her large eyes sparkling with excitement close to me.</p>

<p>“Oh, that was——”</p>
<p>“Well, It doesn’t matter who it was!”</p>

<p>Yuu Shibuya abruptly interrupts my attempt to answer politely.</p>

<p>“Anyway, it’s amazing! I want to award them with the title of runner-up for the Amazing Project Developer! Of course, the Grand Prize winner goes to me!”</p>
<p>“O-Okay…?”</p>

<p>She’s incredible.</p>
<p>She’s so self-centred that it feels like the world revolves around her, and I’m starting to wonder if it’s just my illusion.</p>

<p>“Uh… Shibuya-san, why did you join this study abroad?”</p>
<p>“Shibuya-san? Hey, why aren’t we on familiar terms? Using polite language with someone the same age is really meaningless. Call me Yuu! And I’ll call you Shin, I guess? Is that okay?”</p>
<p>“Ah, fine.”</p>

<p>I didn’t know we were the same age.</p>
<p>I see, Yuu Shibuya seems to be a high school sophomore.</p>

<p>“So, what did you come to this program, Yuu?”</p>
<p>“You’re asking question like some TV program or something. What did I come for? Is there anything more fun to do than this? I think there’s even a possibility it’ll go viral!”</p>
<p>“Go viral…?”</p>
<p>“What, you don’t even know about ‘go viral’ either?”</p>
<p>“No, I know what it means, but…”</p>

<p>It’s supposed to refer to something getting widely spread on social media.</p>
<p>My question is why she brought that up now… And then it hits me.</p>

<p>“Wait, Yuu Shibuya… Are you that YouTuber?”</p>
<p>“Exactly! My channel is 【 Yuu Shibuya’s World】. Of course you’ve seen it, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, I haven’t seen it… Is that the name of your channel?”</p>
<p>“You haven’t seen it? Why? You’re missing out on 100% of life!”</p>
<p>“100% of life?”</p>
<p>“100% of life!”</p>

<p>I’m utterly overwhelmed by her assertiveness as she claims that as if it’s the most natural thing in the world.</p>

<p>“Anyway, I’m going to film and edit the footage of this study abroad and upload it to my channel!”</p>
<p>“Will that make you go viral?”</p>
<p>“You won’t know until you try, but there’s a good chance it will!”</p>

<p>With a mischievous smile, she continues,</p>

<p>“High school students searching for a marriage partner and going on a love journey? Not just in Japan but also overseas, even to places that are not easily accessible! And all participants are beautiful high school girls with some special qualities?! It’s a love survival where anyone could be left behind, I bet everyone wants to see such a battle!”</p>
<p>“Is that so…”</p>

<p>Unfortunately, I know nothing about going viral.</p>

<p>“The person who came up with this program is a runner-up, the unfortunate thing is that they wanted to keep it closed without streaming it anywhere. That’s why it’s called runner-up.”</p>

<p>Well, back when my mother came up with this idea, the term ‘going viral’ was probably just emerging.</p>

<p>“But is it okay to upload it?”</p>
<p>“The management says they don’t mind as long as I don’t charge for the ads after the whole thing is over, and I have to get permission from each participant myself.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, then if you don’t charge advertising fees, doesn’t it lose its meaning?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Why?”</p>

<p>Yuu frowns.</p>

<p>“I don’t really care about advertising revenue! I just want to create the longest total playback time video in the world!”</p>

<p>She looks up at me with her two shining eyes, which I find distinctive.</p>
<p>They seemed to glow with curiosity and confidence.</p>

<p>“Why do you want to do that?”</p>
<p>“I want to become the best version of myself, the only me that only I can be! In other words, I want to be a one-of-a-kind! By doing this, don’t you think I can achieve a special kind of greatness that is easier and more straightforward than just aiming to be number one?”</p>
<p>“…hmm, I somehow get your point.”</p>

<p>Setting aside the repetitive lines in the first half, the latter half has a greater sense of satisfaction compared to the words ‘It’s fine to be who you are’ or ‘It’s fine to not be unique.’</p>

<p>“I’m literally dedicating my life to living in a way that no one in the world has ever experienced!”</p>
<p>“I see, the purpose of your participation in this project is to film it?”</p>
<p>“Exactly! I’ll see this study abroad program through to the end and become number one!”</p>

<p>I frown upon hearing that.</p>

<p>“Wait, until the end? Do you know that the number one person has to marry me? If it’s just about filming the video, there’s no need to go that far.”</p>
<p>“You’re missing the point. I’m the main character in this video, and it’ll be more interesting if the protagonist wins!”</p>

<p>Am I the one who’s missing the point…? I mean…</p>

<p>“Is it really okay to decide on marriage so easily? You’re still in high school, and you’re already making decisions about your entire life? Well, I guess it’s not my place to say anything since I’m also participating in this program.”</p>
<p>“Early at high school age? Then, at what age is it okay? By the way, how long do you plan to live?”</p>

<p>Yuu squints her eyes.</p>

<p>“How long? I don’t know.”</p>
<p>“Exactly, you don’t know! It could be until tomorrow. So, there’s no such thing as experiencing things too early. Marriage? I’ll face it head-on!”</p>

<p>She seems to be a bit of a daredevil, but she seems to have a deep philosophy.</p>
<p>I can’t take my eyes off her sparkling gaze as I silently admire her.</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Leona Kanda</strong></p>

<p>Fifth candidate: Leona Kanda.</p>

<p>“Hello, I’m Leona Kanda, 17 years old, a high school senior.”</p>

<p>With a resolute attitude, she bowed her head, and behind her beautiful smile, there is a mysterious sense of dignity that made it difficult to read her mind.</p>
<p>That name and face… she’s a celebrity I know too.</p>
<p>Leona Kanda is a renowned child actress who has been the number one celebrity ‘I’d like to have as my daughter’ for almost a decade now.</p>

<p>“… aren’t you going on a hiatus to study abroad?”</p>
<p>“It’s not wrong, is it? This is also a study abroad program.”</p>

<p>Her smile exudes a mysterious charm.</p>

<p>“By the way, are you curious about my hiatus?”</p>
<p>“…I overheard my friend talking about it in the classroom.”</p>
<p>“Hmm, classmates, huh?”</p>

<p>She casually corrected me…</p>
<p>Well, I did exaggerate by calling them friends, but how did she figure it out?</p>
<p>Was it written in my profile used for the audition that I was a loner?</p>

<p>“Anyway, if you know about me, you could be a bit more surprised. Your reaction seems a bit dull.”</p>
<p>“That might be true…”</p>
<p>“Ahaha, well, this is also fine.”</p>

<p>Having encountered a former idol and a step-sister, I seem to have grown somewhat numb to these things.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Kanda-san smiles generously.</p>

<p>“Now, why did Kanda-san decide to participate in this study abroad?”</p>
<p>“Before that, you can simply call me Kanda. We are actually the same age now, so it’s okay to use casual language.”</p>

<p>I hesitate to use casual language with a senior, but if she prefers it, I don’t need to stick to formal language.</p>

<p>“Sure…then Kanda, why did you choose this study abroad?”</p>
<p>“Hmm, to be honest, I’m just planning to use and take advantage of Hirakawa.”</p>
<p>“Use? How?”</p>

<p>She raises two fingers.</p>

<p>“For ‘male repellent’ and ‘name recognition.’. Because I want to be an actress for life, until death separates me from acting.”</p>
<p>“For life… So, you need ‘male repellent’ and ‘name recognition’ for that?”</p>
<p>“Yes, exactly. I’ll explain it properly.”</p>

<p>Kanda nodded with a small smile.</p>

<p>“It started around when I became a high school student. Being an active actress as a high school girl seems to have become a strange brand. I’ve had actors, male idols, young producers, and occasionally even directors try to hit on me… It was getting tiresome. So, I thought if I got married early to someone whom nobody would dare approach, it would solve the problem.”</p>
<p>“And that someone is me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s the idea.”</p>
<p>“…I’m just a struggling student, though.”</p>

<p>She maintained her smile.</p>
<p>Despite my rebuttal, I understood what she meant.</p>
<p>It wasn’t about me being an overwhelmingly charismatic person that no one can rival.</p>

<p>It was about nobody daring to woo the fiancé of Shinnosuke Hirakawa’s son——It’s a bold move that no one would dare attempt.</p>
<p>Especially if you are an adult.</p>

<p>“You’re working hard as a struggling student to uphold your principles, right? That’s not something just anyone can do. I think you’re plenty attractive.”</p>
<p>“Is it? thank you…”</p>

<p>I felt a little happy being praised out of the blue.</p>
<p>Let’s do a 2-second meditation.</p>

<p>“Ahaha, are you trying to play it cool?”</p>

<p>She looks at me with a mischievous smile as if she can see right through me.</p>

<p>“Cough… So, I understand the ‘male repellent’ part. What about the ‘name recognition’?”</p>
<p>“Well, it means eventually becoming the lifetime partner of Japan’s top businessman.”</p>

<p>Eventually… I see.</p>
<p>Although no one knows what will happen in reality, let’s set that aside for now.</p>

<p>“What does this have to do with your acting career?”</p>
<p>“Completely unrelated, in essence.”</p>
<p>“Unrelated in essence but related in some other way?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, something like that.”</p>

<p>She tilted her head, and then she pointed her finger.</p>

<p>“It’s about branding. There are many people in the world who try to measure a person’s worth based on whether they’re popular rather than if they’re genuinely exceptional. People who rely on public opinion to judge aesthetic value.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p>I have experienced firsthand that many people judge others not by who they are as individuals but by the labels and titles they carry.</p>

<p>“If I want to be an actress for a lifetime, I have to keep getting work. So, I have to be conscious of this branding aspect as well.”</p>
<p>“It’s a tough world…”</p>

<p>Well, I guess there’s no such thing as an easy world in the professional sphere.</p>

<p>“Because of that, I want to marry you for my own sake. But I don’t think it’s a bad deal for Hirakawa either.”</p>
<p>“Why is that?”</p>
<p>“For the same reason, you can become ‘the man who won Japan’s top actress.’ In a different sense, people around you will start to admire you. Besides…”</p>

<p>There was a mysterious charm in her smile.</p>

<p>“I have the confidence to live(act) my life as the person you want me to be.”</p>


<p style="text-align: center;"><strong>Sumire Osaki</strong></p>

<p>Sixth candidate: Sumire Osaki</p>

<p>Finally, the last person.</p>
<p>As she appeared at the entrance of the chapel in a lavender dress, the poem, ‘As beautiful as glass’ fleetingly crossed my unsophisticated mind.</p>

<p>However, it only lasted a moment, not because her beauty disappeared in an instant, but because her face, raised right after, was like shards of glass that pierced directly into my brain.</p>
<p>As I stiffened and trembled, I stood before her as she gracefully bowed.</p>
<p>She offered me a manufactured smile, just like back then.</p>

<p>“Hello, it’s been a while, Hirakawa-kun.”</p>
<p>“Sumire… Osaki?”</p>

<p>Sumire Osaki, 18 years old, a high school senior, and the daughter of the president of the major telecommunications company Osaki Holdings.</p>
<p>And she was my ex-girlfriend.</p>

<p>In the end, there probably weren’t any romantic feelings between us, so I don’t know if calling her that is appropriate.</p>
<p>However, it’s an intricate relationship to call her an acquaintance and not quite peaceful enough to call her a friend.</p>
<p>After searching for words to express it somehow, the fact remains that ‘ex-girlfriend’ is the only way to put it.</p>

<p>Well, the label of our relationship doesn’t really matter anymore.</p>
<p>Anyway, the girlfriend who suddenly disappeared from my life that day once again appeared in front of me out of the blue.</p>

<p>“Why are you here?”</p>
<p>“That should be obvious since you seem to have decided to succeed the Hirakawa Group.”</p>
<p>“I’m not succeeding it. I’m going to reclaim it.”</p>
<p>“…Your stubborn pride hasn’t changed. The result is the same, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>After a slight pause, she replied.</p>
<p>She’s still using those claw-like words to provoke me.</p>
<p>Back then, I honestly believed this was a kind of tsundere expression. I wanted to punch my past self.</p>

<p>…Wait? Is that really the case?</p>

<p>“By the way, are you talking with the assumption that I’ll become the president of Hirakawa? I’m just going to be the president of a subsidiary company.”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>Ah?</p>

<p>“Becoming the president of a company affiliated with the Hirakawa Group doesn’t change. And if you choose me, Osaki Holdings can back you up. As a result, you will surely become the president of Hirakawa. That’s all.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I see… Hey, did you just say ‘Ah’?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about…?”</p>

<p>She narrowed her eyes and glared at me. This person is playing dumb…!</p>

<p>“Well, never mind… Anyway, you’re interested in my position, and that’s why you joined?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. What else could it be?”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>

<p>In that case, that must have been the reason she approached me three years ago in the first place.</p>
<p>…Well, I guess that’s only natural.</p>

<p>Looking at her with a mix of exasperation and resignation, I noticed Osaki’s almond-shaped eyes fixed on me and she slightly tensed her body.</p>

<p>“…What do you think?”</p>

<p>Then, a mysterious question came flying at me.</p>

<p>“What do I think? About what?”</p>
<p>“Of course about my reason for participating. Sigh, you really have no ability to read context; how pitiful. You may have raised your language test score by burying your face in books, but communication skills can only be obtained through real conversations with people. I don’t blame you.”</p>
<p>“You’re saying such amazing things…”</p>

<p>It’s true, I don’t have any friends.</p>
<p>I once tried to include this foul-mouthed girl in my ‘bare minimum necessary connections,’ but even that attempt was a failure, so there’s no helping it.</p>

<p>“It’s not too late. In your future life, you’ll have plenty of conversations with me. Then, you’ll naturally become capable.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>

<p>Osaki glared at me again.</p>

<p>“No, it’s just that you said ‘future life’ and ‘plenty with me’…”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>Ah?</p>

<p>“I may be only interested in your position, but after all, I’m here with the purpose of marrying you. If your communication skills as my spouse are lacking, I’ll be seen as having no discerning eye for people. That’s all I’m saying.”</p>
<p>“Okay, I see…? Hey, did you just say ‘Ah’ again?”</p>
<p>“You, do you have a fever…? Or did you mishear because you’re extremely nervous?”</p>
<p>“You’re trying to cover it up again…”</p>

<p>It’s almost like she’s… no, I shouldn’t harbour such expectations anymore.</p>
<p>Those expectations will only become my shackles.</p>
<p>I slightly shook my head in a way that she wouldn’t understand, brushing away my overly sweet anticipation.</p>

<p>“…Hirakawa-kun, that…”</p>

<p>Osaki seemed nervous or hesitant, pressing her chest and attempting to say something while looking up at me, but…</p>

<p>“Hm?”</p>
<p>“…It’s nothing. Let’s talk again later.”</p>

<p>She averted her gaze.</p>

<p> </p>

<p>Once the greetings with everyone were over, I went up to the rooftop of Sky Tower with Juujo-san.</p>
<p>It was past 6 PM, and the sun was setting.</p>

<p>“The rooftop has turned into a pool?”</p>

<p>I guess you could also call it a resort pool.</p>
<p>By the poolside (though it’s more like the main area), there were bar counters, stand tables, deck chairs, and sofas made of woven rattan, with candles lighting up various spots.</p>
<p>Furthermore, tropical plants like palm trees were planted around, creating an oriental atmosphere.</p>

<p>“Ladies of the bride candidates have just finished their self-introductions in another room and are now coming here after leaving their belongings and freshening up. After that, we will have the first drink party, where we’ll explain the rules in more detail.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>

<p>As she was saying that…</p>

<p>“Wow, it’s so romantic! Ah, it’s Shinichi-kun! Hi!♡”</p>
<p>“Can you stop calling Shinichi like that, Ria-chan?”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand, Sakiho-san. What’s the point of protecting Onīchan like that?”</p>
<p>“Woo, Maion-chan, nice! It’s a beautiful view with an ugly fight! What an amazing sight!”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, an ugly fight? Shibuya is so straightforward, huh? What do you think, Hirakawa?”</p>
<p>“Hey, Kanda-san. Can you stop suddenly sneaking and pretending as if you’re not an outsider?”</p>

<p>When I turned towards the voice, the six women were coming, still dressed in their fancy dresses.</p>
<p>Really, they looked quite impressive lined up together.</p>
<p>Peach, black, white, red, emerald, purple.</p>

<p>Each dress may be different in style, but even I can tell that each woman is exceptionally attractive in her own way according to societal standards.</p>

<p>“Ladies, please go to the drink counter over there and choose your favorite beverage.”</p>

<p>As I looked where Juujo-san was pointing, there was a chic bar counter under a roof made of wood like a pavilion.</p>
<p>Several bartenders were lined up.</p>

<p>Even though there were only eight people including Juujo-san, the treatment was quite something.</p>
<p>It seems my mother spared no expense in my bride search.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s a party we have now. I can’t let my guard down, but there’s no point in just standing here.</p>

<p>Just as I was about to head to get a drink, in that moment…</p>

<p>“Shinichi-kun~!”</p>

<p>With a dazzling smile, a girl tightly hugged my right arm.</p>

<p>“What are you drinking? Shall we go together~?♡”</p>

<p>It was Ria Meguro, the former top idol.</p>
<p>Even though the sun was setting, her smile was as bright as sunlight that I leaned back a bit.</p>
<p>Feeling the sensation I felt on my arm that was unexpectedly soft, my heart was racing.</p>
<p>Even though she’s a beauty, to have such a bust…Life is so unfair, even the gods must be playing tricks.</p>

<p>As I was pretending to remain calm, my consciousness drifted towards the heaven.</p>
<p>No, wait, am I ascending?</p>

<p>“Just a moment, Ria-chan, could you stop hugging my childhood friend and future husband so casually?”</p>

<p>My childhood friend, Sakiho Shinagawa, pouted and took hold of my other arm.</p>

<p>“What are you talking about? Wrong, it’s Rii future fiancé, okay?”</p>
<p>“Shut up, we’ve been engaged for years already.”</p>
<p>“Ohh~ You’re still cherishing a promise from when you were little! Sakiho-chan, you’re so fairy-tale-like♡ Your head is like a flower garden♡”</p>
<p>“I won’t fall for such a cheap provocation.”</p>

<p>Sakiho glared at her, or rather, she’s completely taken the bait…</p>
<p>When I looked away, Yuu Shibuya was licking her lips and capturing this moment with her camera.</p>

<img src="https://animestuff.me/img/0007_m6.png" alt="" />

<p>Osaki Sumire stared at us with a displeased look, arms crossed.</p>
<p>Hirakawa Maion had already ordered a Dr. Pepper from the bar counter and was drinking it ahead of everyone else.</p>
<p>And then…</p>

<p>“Hirakawa, what would you like to drink? You seem busy, should I bring it to you?”</p>

<p>Kanda Leona approached me with a confident smile.</p>

<p>“Tsk…”</p>

<p>Looking at her, I felt like I heard a faint tongue clicking from my right side for a moment.</p>

<p>“Ria?”</p>
<p>“Yes, what is it, Shinichi-kun?♡”</p>
<p>“Ah, no, it’s nothing…”</p>

<p>She definitely clicked her tongue….what happen? You’re scaring me…</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>With each of us having our drinks from the bar counter, Juujo-san came over.</p>

<p>“Now, I’ll briefly explain the flow of events from now on. If you have any questions, feel free to ask.”</p>
<p>“Okayy!”</p>

<p>Yuu raised the hand opposite to the one holding her smartphone and answered on behalf of everyone.</p>

<p>“From now on, you will be living together here at Roppongi Sky Tower. Please take a look.”</p>

<p>As Juujo-san said that and snapped her fingers, a 3D hologram of Roppongi Sky Tower was projected above the pool.</p>

<p>“Wow, what is this? Amazing!”</p>

<p>Yuu excitedly pointed her smartphone camera in that direction.</p>

<p>“Here at Roppongi Sky Tower, we have not only your rooms but also a resort pool, sauna &amp;amp; spa, live bar, cafe, playroom, library, and other facilities similar to those found in luxury hotels.”</p>

<p>Said Juujo-san as lines emerged from various places in the hologram of Sky Tower, indicating the locations of each facility.</p>

<p>“I think it’s too luxurious to run this program alone… Is there some hidden agenda?”</p>

<p>Osaki raised her hand to ask, and Juujo-san nodded.</p>

<p>“Thank you for your question, Osaki Sumire-sama.Your concern is quite valid. These facilities will be exclusively reserved for you during the love study program. However, starting from next year, we plan to open it as a VIP private hotel where weddings can also be held.”</p>
<p>“So, we are essentially on a trial run?”</p>
<p>“You are absolutely right. Your quick understanding is appreciated.”</p>

<p>I see, wedding venues and hotels are indeed closely related.</p>

<p>“This time, we have removed the SIM cards from everyone’s smartphones. Additionally, the WiFi from the 61st floor to the rooftop of Sky Tower is not accessible. Inside the hotel, there is an internal line communication system to contact me, but we ask that you communicate with each other only face-to-face. If you need any information, you can use the newspapers and database in the library.”</p>
<p>“What’s a ‘database’?”</p>

<p>This time, Kanda asked a question.</p>

<p>“It is an electronic encyclopedia created by the Hirakawa Group, containing a vast collection of books and publicly available information from all over the world, equivalent to the National Diet Library. Since it’s electronic, the information is regularly updated.”</p>
<p>“Oh, it sounds like it won’t be boring.”</p>
<p>“It would take a lifetime to read everything. By the way, Maion-sama is the one who created the foundation of the system for the study abroad program, including this database.”</p>
<p>“This little kid did? Wow, that’s impressive!”</p>
<p>“It’s puzzling. There is no correlation between physique and brain performance.”</p>

<p>As Yuu’s hand reached to pat her head, Maion looked displeased and moved away.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s proceed with the actual rule explanation.”</p>

<p>I swallowed nervously.</p>
<p>This is an important part. How I assess these women will shape the course of events.</p>

<p>“To confirm once again, the purpose of this love study is to find Shinichi-sama’s life partner.”</p>

<p>Gulp, I heard the sound of someone swallowing somewhere other than myself.</p>

<p>“For that purpose, we have planned a Flower Ceremony once per season.”</p>
<p>“Season? Flower Ceremony?”</p>
<p>“The Flower Ceremony is a ritual where Shinichi-sama presents a bouquet to the person he wishes to spend time with. For each Flower Ceremony, one person will not receive a bouquet, and they will have to leave from this study abroad.”</p>

<p>As explained by Juujo-san before the introductions, this is a program where one person will be eliminated each time.</p>
<p>The women seemed to have heard about it when they joined, as there were no complaints like, ‘Why do such a cruel thing now.’</p>

<p>“We call the first set of Flower Ceremonies Season 1. Then it continues as Season 2, Season 3, and so on. Today, I will only explain Season 1.”</p>

<p>Juujo-san pointed her index finger to the sky.</p>

<p>“During this season, you will head to a total of five dates. First, we have two planned group dates.”</p>
<p>“Group date means going on a date with Shinichi and a few others, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s correct. For the two initial group dates, each will consist of Shinichi-sama and three other members, making a total of four participants.”</p>
<p>“These are the dates to decide the first impression. This is where we introduce the members, right…?”</p>

<p>Yuu seemed to be thinking about the video’s structure.</p>

<p>“The first group consists of Leona Kanda, Ria Meguro, and Yuu Shibuya. The second group consists of Sakiho Shinagawa, Hirakawa Maion, Osaki Sumire; Shinichi-sama is included in both groups.”</p>
<p>“I see. The first one is the ‘first meeting group (Meeting with Shinichi for the first time)’ and the second one is the ‘already acquainted group,’ right?”</p>
<p>“To put it bluntly, yes.”</p>

<p>Juujo-san smiled in response to Sakiho’s response.</p>

<p>“Each group will compete, and the winners will earn the right to go on an ‘additional date’ with Shinichi-sama. Immediately after the group date, you will have the right to spend time alone together.”</p>
<p>“Just the two of us…! “</p>

<p>The atmosphere suddenly became lively.</p>
<p>Regardless of the value of spending time with me, having an opportunity for a conversation alone in this program is advantageous.</p>
<p>It will allow me to better understand each of them.</p>

<p>“After the two group dates are over, you will go on two ‘1-on-1 dating’ next.”</p>
<p>“1-on-1 dating? So, this time it’s a 1-on-1 date with Shinichi?”</p>

<p>Sakiho asked again.</p>

<p>“That’s right. Unlike the additional dates, Shinichi-sama will decide the destination and activities for these dates.”</p>
<p>“Ah, is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right. Of course, we will provide support as well.”</p>

<p>Caught off guard, I let out an embarrassed and bewildered voice.</p>
<p>However, this isn’t a bad thing.</p>
<p>I see, it means that if there’s someone you really want to talk to, you can have a relaxed conversation during these one-on-one dates.</p>

<p>“After the two ‘1-on-1 dating’ are over, we will have the final ‘Everyone Date.’ It will be a date with all participants together. This will be the last chance for everyone to appeal to Shinichi-sama. There are no specific competitions planned for this date.”</p>
<p>“Everyone! It sounds like there will be lots of great moments!”</p>
<p>“Everyone…? It sounds lively and tiring.”</p>

<p>Yuu and Maion voiced their honest impressions.</p>

<p>“Lastly, we will have the ‘Flower Ceremony’ at Roppongi Sky Tower. Here, Shinichi-sama will select the five remaining participants.”</p>

<p>In other words,</p>
<p>“In the end, one person will be chosen to leave this study abroad program here.”</p>

<p>Finally, the first person to be eliminated will be determined there.</p>

<p>“This is the flow of Season 1. Do you have any questions?”</p>

<p>After about 2 to 3 seconds of no one speaking up, Yuu said again, ‘Looks like it’s all good!’</p>
<p>Despite the discussion of eliminations, the atmosphere among the women remained nonchalant.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s return to the drink party. Shinichi-sama, please propose a toast.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>I’m not good at speaking.</p>
<p>However, I have seen many executives and leaders deliver short speeches at events and parties multiple times.</p>
<p>If I want to become a leader myself, I can’t avoid it. It’s okay, I can do it, or rather, I have to do it.</p>
<p>This is an important first step that will determine the future of this study abroad program.</p>
<p>Let’s start with a simple and confident opening one.</p>

<p>“C-C-cheers!”</p>

<p>…</p>
<p>…I screwed up.</p>
<p>Let’s do our best next time.</p>
