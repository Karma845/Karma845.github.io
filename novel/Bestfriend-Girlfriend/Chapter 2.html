<h2>Chapter 2: Soul Eater</h2>


<p>The movements of the larvae didn’t cease.</p>



<p>—–Being devoured.</p>



<p>My body disappeared as it was bitten, chewed, sucked, and melted.</p>



<p>—–Being devoured.</p>



<p>They didn’t stop. They didn’t halt. That noise echoing in the cave was surely the joyful voices of the larvae.</p>



<p>—–Being devoured.</p>



<p>They ate my arms. They ate my legs. I would never be able to wield a sword again. I would never walk again.</p>



<p>—–You’re dying.</p>



<p>My eyes, nose, ears, and mouth are filled with larvae. There’s no salvation for me.</p>



<p>—–Will you give up?</p>



<p>I’ve already given up. I’ve probably given up long ago. Mitsurugi Sora couldn’t become anything.</p>



<p>—–You’re truly an idiot.</p>



<p>Yes, I’m an idiot. But what can I do other than give up in this situation?</p>



<p>—–Devour.</p>



<p>…..What?</p>



<p>—–Devour them.</p>



<p>Devour them? These larvae?</p>



<p>—–That’s right.</p>



<p>What sense would it make if I did that? I have no salvation anyway. I already ate dozens of them that entered my mouth, and the hundreds squirming in my body didn’t stop. Furthermore, there are still thousands in the cave. There’s nothing I can do.</p>



<p>—–So, you’ll let them eat you?</p>



<p>Of course not. I don’t want to die. But I can’t do anything. The weak are unnecessary. That’s right. I was unnecessary both in Onigashima and in Ishka. Mitsurugi Sora was unnecessary as a swordsman and as an adventurer! My father’s words were correct!</p>



<p>—–Doesn’t it bother you?</p>



<p>Does it bother me?</p>



<p>—–If you die, your father will laugh.</p>



<p>No, he wouldn’t. Even if he were to hear about his son’s demise, he probably wouldn’t bat an eye. To my father, it’s as if I’m already dead. But…</p>



<p>—–But, what?</p>



<p>Surely Raguna will laugh. Ayaka, Goz, Cecil, and the other apprentices will laugh too. They will say, “Mitsurugi Sora was nothing more than a human at that level.” I’m sure everyone from “Falcon’s Sword,” the guild receptionist, and the innkeeper and his daughter will also laugh.</p>



<p>—–Doesn’t that bother you?</p>



<p>…..Yes, it bothers me. I don’t want them to laugh even if I can’t receive help. It frustrated me just imagining their faces with those smiles. Whether it’s ten or twenty, I will take the lord of the flies’s offspring with me. Fortunately, my mouth can still move. I still have teeth. It’s easy to chew and crush the larvae.</p>



<p>—–Then, devour.</p>



<p>Yes, I will. If I’m going to die anyway, I’ll do it until I die———Yes, if I’m going to do it, then I’ll devour them all. That way, I might be able to survive. There’s not much difference between devouring dozens, hundreds, or thousands of them.</p>



<p>—–Devour them all.</p>



<p>To die devoured? Or to survive by devouring? There’s no other choice. Ahh, why didn’t such a simple thing occur to me?</p>



<p>—–Devour them all.</p>



<p>Not just the larvae. Also those who mocked me, those who belittled me, those who betrayed me. I will devour them all.</p>



<p>—–I am you.</p>



<p>Yes. It’s because of everything I’ve been through until I turned 18.</p>



<p>—–You are me.</p>



<p>Mitsurugi Sora can’t do anything. Can’t fight. Can’t protect anything.</p>



<p>—–We are one and the same.</p>



<p>Someone who is nothing but can become anything? What can I do if I can’t even fulfill my promise to my mother? The only thing I can do…</p>



<p>—–Synchronization has been completed.</p>



<p>Devour everything, that’s all.</p>



<p>—–Here and now, we will be reborn.</p>



<p>In a strange place, my consciousness rises from reality after a conversation with someone unknown.</p>



<p>In the end, I had a strange vision.</p>



<p>As far as the eye could see, there was a desolate land filled with rocks and mud.</p>



<p>There was a massive tree in that place. It was an oak. And a gigantic beast like a mountain stood beside the tree as if protecting it.</p>



<p>That gigantic beast covered in black scales reminiscent of the night sky was undoubtedly a dragon. The strongest mythical creature among them all.</p>



<p>It seemed to notice my gaze. The dragon moved its long neck and looked at me.</p>



<p>I didn’t understand the expressions of the dragon. I didn’t understand the dragon’s language.</p>



<p>However, it seemed like the dragon was smiling for some reason.</p>



<p>Nevertheless, I felt like I could understand its words.</p>



<p>The dragon told me its name.</p>



<p>Its name is—</p>



<p>If I were to force this feeling into words, it was as if I had swallowed the sun.</p>



<p>“AAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!”</p>



<p>I screamed. I screamed. I screamed.</p>



<p>Burn. Burn. Burn. Burn. Burn. Burn. Burn. Burn. Burn. Burn. Burn. Burn. Burn…</p>



<p>My entire body is engulfed in flames. Hot oil has been applied to my whole body.</p>



<p>My bones are burning. My flesh is boiling.</p>



<p>All my blood turns into scalding water and rushes from the tip of my head to the tips of my toes at high speed.</p>



<p>At this rate, I’ll explode. Just like a water balloon when pierced by a needle.</p>



<p>This heat expanding in my body.</p>



<p>This power raging in my body.</p>







<p>If this isn’t released even for a second, Mitsurugi Sora’s body will turn into scattered pieces of flesh!</p>



<p>Scream. Scream. Scream.</p>



<p>I know. I know. I know.</p>



<p>How can I unleash the power? How can I give it form?</p>



<p>I certainly know this illusory power within my body!</p>



<p>—–We are one and the same.</p>



<p>A direction is being given to the power that is raging and furious.</p>



<p>In my outstretched hand, an uncontrollable power like a torrent gathers as a black glow.</p>



<p>Thin, long.</p>



<p>Sharp, strong.</p>



<p>—–Soul Eater.</p>



<p>It was a furious black sword. The manifestation of an eclipse devouring the sun.</p>



<p>The strongest and most ancient mythical species that killed 17 war gods in the era of the gods.</p>



<p>Its name is—</p>



<p>“Devour it all, Soul Eateeeeer!”</p>



<p>At that moment, a black flash that swallowed even the starlight covered the cave.</p>



<p>How much time had passed before the moonlight returned from above?</p>



<p>The black flash vanished, and I stood alone in the cave, breathing heavily.</p>



<p>That’s right, I was standing. My two legs that were devoured by the larvae had regenerated down to the toes and nails.</p>



<p>The same was true for my arms. My left arm regenerated, as did my injured right arm. It felt very strange to move my torn arm.</p>



<p>And my right hand was gripping a katana.</p>



<p>A katana dyed black as darkness from the guard to the hilt was surprisingly in my hand.</p>



<p>The blade was also black. However, the edge of the blade was stained with dripping blood.</p>



<p>I stared intently at the blade.</p>



<p>It had an intimidating sensation that made my skin crawl.</p>



<p>It had a feeling that made my back tremble.</p>



<p>…..I have the memories. So, I know what this is.</p>



<p>No, even if I didn’t remember, I would have instinctively understood.</p>



<p>This is my Soul equipment.</p>



<p>“…..Soul Eater. A soul-devouring dragon, huh?”</p>



<p>Knowledge about the existence of the same source flowed into my mind.</p>



<p>There was no voice responding to my murmurs.</p>



<p>However, the black katana reflected the moonlight and shimmered faintly, as if congratulating me on the manifestation of the Soul Eater equipment. That venomous glow and fresh blood-like appearance.</p>



<p>Suddenly, something moved in my field of vision.</p>



<p>Upon looking, a larva about the size of a child’s head was desperately trying to escape from me.</p>



<p>And upon closer inspection, I could see similar larvae all around.</p>



<p>It seems that the group that devoured my body was annihilated by the heat at the moment of the manifestation of my Soul Eater equipment, but there are still many larvae in this cave.</p>



<p>If they attacked together, it would be a great threat, but it seems they didn’t have such intentions.</p>



<p>Perhaps this is the first time I am facing external monsters that are not paralyzed.</p>



<p>“A creature that lays many eggs will go for external enemies—– something like that?”</p>



<p>I recalled the characteristics of the creatures I heard from Luna Maria. The reason for laying many eggs is that, if they don’t, there won’t be individuals that can survive to adulthood. A lord of the flies that lays thousands of eggs is already practically a great effort and problem.</p>



<p>“I wonder if that lord of the flies would be frustrated if, with all the trouble it went through, it returned and saw all its children annihilated!”</p>



<p>Pff, a small laugh escaped me. They probably would have caught me if that lord of the flies hadn’t trapped me.</p>



<p>In a certain sense, it would be my benefactor, even if it’s an insect.</p>



<p>Well, I don’t mind. With all the gratitude and anger welling up from the bottom of my heart, I will tear apart all its children.</p>



<p>Certainly, at this point, I should find a way to escape, but that will be for later.</p>



<p>The despair I felt before has not yet faded. I remember the fear of being eaten alive.</p>



<p>For that reason, the pleasure of revenge was exceptional. It’s a shame I can’t hear the lamenting cries of the larvae.</p>



<p>Let’s start with the ones that are closest!</p>



<p>“Alright—– Ugh!”</p>



<p>The moment I cut down a large larva, a strange voice escaped me. If there were people here, they would definitely laugh. It was such a foolish voice. Surprised, I covered my mouth.</p>



<p>What was that!? The moment I cut, an indescribable sensation ran through my body. If I were to compare it, yes, it felt as if I were consoling myself…..it was a sensation very close to sexual pleasure.</p>



<p>“…..W-What happened?”</p>



<p>I was really surprised, but that doesn’t change what I’m doing.</p>



<p>I aimed for the next larva and swung my black katana again.</p>



<p>“Hm!”</p>



<p>As I predicted, I was able to suppress the strange voice from before. Does something happen when I kill a larva? But there doesn’t seem to be anything harmful.</p>



<p>Cut.</p>



<p>“Huh!”</p>



<p>Cut.</p>



<p>“Fuu”</p>



<p>Stab.</p>



<p>“Hm, good”</p>



<p>Stab.</p>



<p>“Very well”</p>



<p>I’ll stab once more.</p>



<p>“I’m getting used to this”</p>



<p>After repeating it several times, I got used to the pleasure. Suddenly, I crushed a small larva with my foot—then, I thought. It’s indeed difficult to step on them barefoot. I also thought that it wouldn’t be anything new to kill them by biting, but…</p>



<p>“Alright, with this”</p>



<p>I grabbed a nearby stone and tried to crush them with it.</p>



<p>Then, that pleasure didn’t transmit. To test it, I tried to crush about five of them of different sizes, but the result didn’t change.</p>



<p>Then, I killed one with the black katana, and the pleasure revived.</p>



<p>“Larvae don’t do anything when they die. This must be the ability of my Soul Eater equipment”</p>



<p>In that case, it shouldn’t be something so bad.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, there’s no instruction manual for my Soul Eater equipment, so I have no choice but to figure out how to use it and its effects on my own.</p>



<p>For now, it’ll be revenge for devouring several people.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>I continued cutting them down one after another while humming a tune.</p>
<p>30 minutes, 1 hour, 1 and a half hours, 2 hours. No matter how much time passes, I don’t get bored. I don’t get tired.</p>
<p>It was when I had cut down about 300 of them. I felt a strong impact in my body. It was different from the previous sensation. It was a mysterious feeling as if my body was being washed from the inside or being reconstructed from scratch.</p>
<p>It was a sensation I had never experienced before. Driven by a hunch, I opened my mouth.</p>
<p>“…..”Level Open””</p>
<p>I checked my level with a trembling voice. Then, a number appeared that I had never seen before.</p>
<p>“”2″”</p>
<p>That’s what it showed. My level, which had never increased, had certainly increased.</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>I unintentionally struck a celebratory pose. I was convinced. My Soul Eater equipment increases the efficiency of experience acquisition—no, it’s not something on that level.</p>
<p>My Soul Eater equipment is devouring “something” more than just experience.</p>
<p>Since its name is Soul Eater, that something must be souls.</p>
<p>The source of life, the foundation of existence. It devours them and converts them into levels.</p>
<p>I suppose that because my level never increased, when my Soul Eater equipment devours a soul, it’s surely comparable to the hundreds of experience points gained by other adventurers.</p>
<p>No, I don’t think it’s hundreds. Maybe it’s possible for it to reach thousands.</p>
<p>Anyway, it’s safe to assume that by killing enemies with my Soul Eater equipment, I can obtain large amounts of experience.</p>
<p>The pleasure I felt before must be something like an exaggerated reaction of the mind and body to the acquired experience.</p>
<p>Acquiring large amounts of experience suddenly made my body react.</p>
<p>“Now I know!”</p>
<p>I looked around. I observed that there were still many larvae everywhere. If that’s the case, there won’t be a shortage of enemies.</p>
<p>My eyes lit up, and I tightened my grip on my Soul Eater equipment. Unexpectedly, the corners of my mouth rose greatly.</p>





<p>—————-</p>
<p>“She” had no name.</p>
<p>Humans called her the lord of the flies, but the name didn’t matter to her.</p>
<p>No matter how the prey called her, “she” didn’t care. However, it’s just a different perspective.</p>
<p>“She” was cautious. Sometimes cowardly, but cautious. That’s why she was able to survive until she became an adult.</p>
<p>In the Tittis Forest, the power of the lord of the flies is high.</p>
<p>In a fight, she could defeat most opponents.</p>
<p>However, it’s a story after becoming an adult. “She” had lived being hunted instead of hunting.</p>
<p>The prey for “her” was mainly corpses. Or the leftovers of other creatures.</p>
<p>Both were terribly bad, but she couldn’t change her way of life. There were always risks when hunting.</p>
<p>The countless number of siblings decreased over time, and before she realized it, “she” was left alone. But she thought it would be easier that way.</p>
<p>How many times had she been on the verge of death because of her siblings who didn’t understand the danger?</p>
<p>Taking that into account, she considered herself lucky to be alone. That’s how “she” thought.</p>
<p>Indeed, she had survived to adulthood in the dangerous Tittis Forest. And she was fortunate enough to find a mate.</p>
<p>Many children were born.</p>
<p>And when the children were born, she would have to go hunting to feed them.</p>
<p>“She” was overwhelmed. There was also a small significance in clearing the depression that had escaped and hidden until now.</p>
<p>Even now, she was injecting venom into a human woman trapped in the forest.</p>
<p>She was a little different from the humans “she” knew, but that was trivial compared to the value of food.</p>
<p>The previous meal was a man with tough meat; some children liked it, but most preferred the tender meat of women.</p>
<p>“She” was satisfied to have caught her today.</p>
<p>However, she felt that the number of humans entering the forest was decreasing. It must be because she had been hunting a lot lately. There would be days when there would be no prey. That alone depressed her.</p>
<p>Recently, the children had grown a lot, and securing food had become very difficult.</p>
<p>It would be easier if they could satisfy themselves with insects and forest beasts, but the children liked humans.</p>
<p>More than worrying about knowledge, their reaction to eating was more interesting.</p>
<p>She couldn’t complain because “she” remembered that point.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the problem of obtaining food was not something “she” could avoid.</p>
<p>Her mother was very problematic, always giving her children negative things (even dead ones).</p>
<p>The first thought of “her” when becoming a mother was that she wouldn’t do the same.</p>
<p>Therefore, for “her,” hunting humans was “difficult but necessary.”</p>
<p>Then, she returned to her nest in a good mood, but the moment she saw the entrance, she felt a bad premonition.</p>
<p>She had forgotten it for a long time since she became an adult—the feeling of danger.</p>
<p>Feeling that sensation, “she” was able to survive in the Tittis Forest until now.</p>
<p>But today, she couldn’t feel it. This was because the feeling was centered on her nest.</p>
<p>Her nest was located deep in the Tittis Forest. The entrance was on a small cliff.</p>
<p>In that way, it wouldn’t be easy for external enemies to approach her children.</p>
<p>However, flying enemies were not limited to this, so “she” aggressively took them down whenever she encountered an enemy of that type.</p>
<p>Just the other day, she took down a passing Wyvern.</p>
<p>Because of that, there were no external enemies targeting the nest from the sky. Therefore, there shouldn’t be any danger.</p>
<p>“She” vibrated her wings finely and rubbed her eight legs. If she’s a human, her body should be trembling with cold sweat.</p>
<p>Bad. Bad. This is bad.</p>
<p>Her instincts were sounding an alarm bell. They were telling her, “Get away now, if you enter, you will die.”</p>
<p>But “she” entered the nest. She didn’t release the captured woman. Here were her children. Her adorable children she had given birth to were waiting for their new meal. If she went back, they would surely hurry up and ask for food. They should come. No, they have to.</p>
<p>In that case, why?</p>
<p>– Why didn’t her children show up?<br />
– Why is the nest so calm?<br />
– Why? Why… is the human they were supposed to devour standing?</p>
<p>“Hahaha! I see you’re angry! If you can understand this situation, that means you have a certain level of intelligence.”</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>“Do you understand? I cut down all your children. They were very noisy, but they were probably crying, waiting for their mommy to save them.”</p>
<p>Shut up.</p>
<p>“But, it’s a shame! Mommy didn’t make it in time! Even though you were so close, if you had come back 30 minutes earlier, about 50 of them would have been saved.”</p>
<p>Shut up!</p>
<p>“Well, that’s how it goes. Hahaha! Thanks, lord of the flies! Thanks to you, my level “1” has increased to “4”! It was a very delicious hunt.”</p>
<p>Shut up. Shut up. Shut up. Shut up!</p>
<p>Don’t let yourself be swayed, you damn prey!</p>
<p>“———!”</p>
<p>When she threw the captured woman into a corner of the cave, “she” let out a silent roar and violently vibrated her four wings.</p>
<p>And she rushed towards the human like a gust of wind.</p>
<p>When she captured this human, she had no intention of killing him. But now, she didn’t have to do that.</p>
<p>I’ll kill you!</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>It was a tremendous impulse. In a cave that wasn’t that wide, and with that uncontrollable speed, “she” crashed into the wall with a loud roar.</p>
<p>The vertically long cave swayed tremendously, and the collapsed wall turned into dirt and sand and poured onto “her.”</p>
<p>But for “her,” who was the lord of the flies, it was like the sting of a mosquito.</p>
<p>Swords or arrows didn’t pierce her strong outer layer, even lower or middle-class magic was repelled.</p>
<p>It’s possible to hurt her with higher-class magic, but it’s not easy to target the lord of the flies, who has great agility in the air.</p>
<p>If one receives an impact from that incomparable body, a human would be turned into scattered pieces of flesh.</p>
<p>It’s the same for that human— but it was at that moment when “she” was convinced.</p>
<p>“What a pity, you failed.”</p>
<p>An unpleasant voice came from behind. When “she” heightened her senses and looked back, there stood the man she was supposed to have crushed.</p>
<p>“Hahaha! I feel so light! Compared to this, it’s as if I were wearing very heavy lead armor yesterday” he chuckled.</p>
<p>Wha–?! </p>
<p>“If it frustrates you, try again. It will be good practice for me,” he taunted.</p>
<p>Filled with rage, “she” violently attacked the man, her compound eyes glowing red.</p>
<p>Once again, a collision and a roar ensued. As earth and mud fell upon her head, “she” thought, this time I got him.</p>
<p>However, the man remained alive. Not only that, but her strong outer shell, which should have been the source of her strength, had been severely cut. Human weapons were not supposed to leave a scratch on her.</p>
<p>What?!</p>
<p>“So, that was an attack without exposing your back, without using your legs, just using the strength of your hands to swing the sword! I cut through that lord of flies like it was a slime!” The man’s expression contorted violently, unable to contain his joy.</p>
<p>And he began to cut at an astonishing speed.</p>
<p>The outer shell was sliced.</p>
<p>The legs were sent flying.</p>
<p>The right eye was pierced.</p>
<p>“She” fought back fiercely, but she couldn’t anticipate the man’s movements.</p>
<p>From one perspective, she was being sliced, struck, and stabbed.</p>
<p>Realizing she couldn’t win, she tried to escape by flying, but with her right eye crushed, her flight was impaired.</p>
<p>Half of her eight legs were lost, making it even difficult to maintain balance in the air.</p>
<p>Now, within “her,” the alarm bells rang like a storm.</p>
<p>I’m going to die. I’m going to die. I will die.</p>
<p>At this rate, she would die. Even the anger she felt upon learning of her children’s deaths was now distant.</p>
<p>If I don’t survive, if I don’t make it out alive…</p>
<p>Frantically spinning her body, she somehow managed to distance herself from the man.</p>
<p>Of course, such resistance shouldn’t work, and the man’s attacks wouldn’t stop—until she thought of something.</p>
<p>“Hmm? I feel like the effectiveness of ‘soul eater’ suddenly dropped,” the man said suspiciously. Then he started murmuring something.</p>
<p>“Is it because you’re about to die? But it’s not different from before. Obviously, you’re trying to flee… Ah, could it be? To efficiently devour a soul, the soul must be active, something like that? Naturally, there’s a difference in the ease of devouring between an enemy who fights head-on and one who runs away with its tail between its legs. In that case, it wouldn’t make sense to prolong this.”</p>
<p>When the man nodded, convinced, he aimed his weapon at “her” again.</p>
<p>As the tip of the black katana pointed at her, “she” was enveloped in a chill she had never felt before.</p>
<p>If “she” were human, she would definitely scream.</p>
<p>I’m going to die. I’m going to die. I’ll be killed.</p>
<p>If I stay here, I’ll definitely be killed!</p>
<p>Wha–?!</p>
<p>She moved her hind wings with all her might, disregarding balance or anything else. It didn’t matter if she hit the wall.</p>
<p>Fly! Fly! Just fly!</p>
<p>She aimed for the exit to the sky. Humans couldn’t fly. If she left the nest, she would be able to escape!</p>
<p>That’s what “she” thought as she continued to move her wings. And from behind…</p>
<p>“Illusionary Sword Style… Tornado!”</p>
<p>That voice rang out.</p>
<p>The next moment, a tremendous impact struck her from below.</p>
<p>The force was so strong that “she” was propelled nearly five meters into the air. The exit was within reach.</p>
<p>Though confused by the inexplicable impact, “she” instinctively moved her wings. No, she tried to.</p>
<p>But the four wings that should have responded to her command were already gone.</p>
<p>In the previous impact, her wings had been shattered and scattered in the air.</p>
<p>And with her wings gone, instead of flying, “she”…</p>
<p>[What?!] she exclaimed, her voice filled with disbelief.</p>
<p>After about five breaths, “she” crashed onto the cave floor. The ground shook intensely, like an earthquake.</p>
<p>Bodily fluid overflowed from the wounds inflicted by the human, and her strength gradually waned.</p>
<p>The man approached, laughing at “her.”</p>
<p>“A flying strike that utilizes the body’s energy in the katana. Tornado is one of the basic techniques of the Illusionary Sword Style. Well, I couldn’t grasp that basic technique until yesterday. And to think I could use it so easily like this, it’s all thanks to you, lord of flies,” he sneered.</p>
<p>A night of darkness and blood.</p>
<p>A sharp blade with a combination of two colors was positioned between “her” eyes.</p>
<p>“She” realized what was about to happen, so she attempted to resist by moving her remaining legs with all her might, but the black katana sliced through her feeble resistance and discarded it.</p>
<p>Now, having lost all her legs and wings, “she” resembled a colossal larva.</p>
<p>“Give my regards to your children in the afterlife,” he said with a voice that invaded her mind. “She” tried to make one last resistance—but then she began to ponder.</p>
<p>She didn’t know where this “afterlife” the human spoke of was, but if she remained still, she might be able to see her children. In that case, it was better this way.</p>
<p>Surely, they must be hungry. She would have to go hunt more prey. That’s what she thought.</p>
<p>However, to do that, she would have to stop attacking the human. She also thought about that.</p>
<p>Those were “her” final thoughts.</p>
<p>————————-</p>





<p>In the moment I stabbed the lord of flies between the eyes, an enormous soul flowed out, incomparable to the larvae I had cut before.</p>
<p>After trembling and relishing the pleasure, as I remembered the last words I spoke, I burst into laughter.</p>
<p>“Hahaha, this feeling! But even if I told you to send my regards to your children in the afterlife, whether it’s your children or the mother, I devoured all their souls. Even if an afterlife existed, it would be impossible for them to meet. Hahahahaha!”</p>
<p>As I laughed, my body trembled. Looking at my level with an expression of joy, the number displayed was “5.” My laughter continued as my level increased in an interesting way.</p>
<p>But I couldn’t laugh forever. I leveled up, but I couldn’t escape the nest and died of hunger. It’s truly ridiculous to even think about it.</p>
<p>I confirmed that there were no side holes in this nest when I crushed the larvae. The only way out is through the hole above.</p>
<p>“Well, that would be easy to do as I am now”</p>
<p>When I fought the lord of flies, I strengthened my physical abilities by dispersing energy throughout my body. And speaking of energy, it is the magical power created within the body.</p>
<p>If I had to say it in the words of magicians, it would be “Od”. By the way, the magical power that exists in nature is called mana.</p>
<p>If you compare magic with Od and magic with mana, the later is usually better.</p>
<p>And speaking of that, it is natural since it is the magical power generated by individuals against the magical power generated by the world, but things change a little with the illusory sword style.</p>
<p>Users of the illusory sword style whose secret is the manifestation of the existence of the same source, the amount of Od is of a greater magnitude.</p>
<p>If you are someone who has their soul equipment, you will have a magical power that cannot be compared to magicians who are by occupation.</p>
<p>By nature, a technique that uses Od was born and refined.</p>
<p>To master the illusory sword style, energy is an indispensable element, so I also learned the basics.</p>
<p>Well, the amount of energy I had until now was insignificant, so I could not even use a basic technique to strengthen my body.</p>
<p>However, the amount of energy I gained with my soul equipment showed a considerable improvement. It feels like there is an endless source in my body.</p>
<p>As a result of combining my physical improvement by increasing in level with physical strengthening by energy, the attack of the lord of flies did not reach me.</p>
<p>Now I can even climb a vertical cliff without tools.</p>
<p>Due to that confidence, I never felt despair, even when trapped at the bottom of a deep hole.</p>
<p>“But there is a problem”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>A girl was at the end of my line of sight. She was a victim like me who was captured by the lord of flies, it seems she is 13 or 14 years old—–if we were talking about a human.</p>
<p>Because she has horns on her forehead. There are two large horns that are clearly visible.</p>
<p>There are also races other than humans in this world. I only know the elf Luna Maria directly, it is not rare to see beastmen and dwarves in the city of Ishka, lizard men, fish men, and there is a rumor that there is also a dragon race.</p>
<p>This girl is also classified as such. She was also a race with a very deep connection to humans.</p>
<p>“So a Kijin (ogre). This is the first time I’ve seen one”</p>
<p>The demon god who was sealed in the “Gate” by the founder of the illusory sword style. The Kijin is a race that worships that demon god.</p>
<p>The two are so closely linked and there is a theory that the Kijin grow in resemblance to the demon god.</p>
<p>The truth of the theory is not entirely clear, but historically it was true that humans and Kijin killed each other in the great war 300 years ago.</p>
<p>After the demon god was sealed, the Kijin were hunted by humans and are now almost extinct.</p>
<p>Even so, if a human finds a Kijin, they form a group and hunt them.</p>
<p>It is not out of fear from 300 years ago—–rather, the horns of the Kijin are prized as high quality magical means.</p>
<p>It can be turned into medicine if processed, if broken, it becomes a material for advanced weapons.</p>
<p>It is said that you can build property with a Kijin horn. Thinking about that, I remembered the rumor I heard earlier.</p>
<p>“Are there mythical species deep in the Tittis forest? It may be unexpectedly true”</p>
<p>While murmuring such things, I walked towards the girl. To be honest, the girl was dirty. Her face, limbs, her long hair were covered in mud, surely she was desperately escaping from the lord of flies. Her clothes too.</p>
<p>…..By the way, is that clothes? I only see large leaves attached and tangled on her.</p>
<p>Maybe it’s a Kijin culture, and when lying down, I can see parts I should not see.</p>
<p>I mean, I’m seeing it. Hm, her breasts are quite large for her age—–wait, now is not the time for that.</p>
<p>“Well, what will I do now?”</p>
<p>At this moment, there is a million possibility in front of me.</p>
<p>Two Kijin horns. With luck, it would be enough to live lazily all my life.</p>
<p>The temptation for money was intense for someone poor like me who can’t even tip, that’s why the innkeeper’s daughter treated me that way.</p>
<p>There are other sources of temptation. The girl was very dirty, but looking closer, she had a pretty face. You could say she’s cute.</p>
<p>It is possible that she will become beautiful over time. And her tempting soul that was more attractive than her appearance.</p>
<p>If I devour this girl, my level will definitely increase by two, no, by three. I was very confident of that.</p>
<p>—–I realized my hand was reaching out to the girl’s body.</p>
<p>However, when I touched the girl’s body, I was surprised at how thin it was.</p>
<p>I was surprised and stopped. What am I trying to do to an injured and unconscious girl?</p>
<p>“————-Huh!”</p>





<p>I quickly pulled my hand away from the girl and slapped my cheek with my fist.</p>
<p>The impact shakes my brain and countless stars dance in my field of vision.</p>
<p>I stroked my aching cheek and exhaled. I knew I was changing after getting my soul equipment.</p>
<p>All I can do is devour—–becoming aware of that, I was far from the teaching of protecting others. Although, I did not hate it at all.</p>
<p>Rather, I feel great. I wonder if this change has been overwhelmed by the soul eater, or was this originally my nature? Memories of my mother and my days in Onigashima only covered my nature?</p>
<p>I have no idea. But speaking of that, I did not particularly care. Anyway, I am me.</p>
<p>However, that is why it is necessary to draw a line to exercise my power. That’s what I thought.</p>
<p>Even if all I can do is devour, it depends on me to decide who or what to devour.</p>
<p>And now I am in a dilemma on how to devour a Kijin girl who particularly did nothing to me.</p>
<p>But I must remain firm. If this is my path, then I will move forward without hesitation.</p>
<p>While thinking about that, a small moan leaked from the girl’s mouth.</p>
<p>Looking at her, the girl frowned and moved her face. It seems she is about to wake up. As expected, after a short time, the girl slowly opened her eyes.</p>
<p>Her big, round eyes opened. At first, the girl’s eyes were relaxed as if she were dreaming, but the moment she noticed me, she woke up immediately.</p>
<p>“?!——-Huh!?”</p>
<p>The girl who leaked a voice that could not be understood, suddenly tried to move and put a surprised expression in an instant.</p>
<p>It is possible that she has noticed that she cannot move from the neck down.</p>
<p>I spoke slowly towards the girl who fluttered her face from left to right.</p>
<p>“Can you understand my words?”</p>
<p>There was no answer to my question. However, the girl’s face became rigid upon hearing my voice, and her lips were tightly clenched. Maybe she understands me.</p>
<p>“You… well, I’m the same, you were attacked by a monster called the lord of flies and brought here, right? Do you remember?”</p>
<p>“…………”</p>
<p>The girl closed her eyes. Apparently she remembers when she was attacked. I decided to reassure this girl.</p>
<p>“I defeated the monster. The corpse is there”</p>
<p>I pointed to the lord of flies whose legs were cut off and his head smashed. The girl was petrified with her eyes wide open.</p>
<p>“We are probably somewhere in the mountains, there is no side hole that could be an exit. To get out, you have to go up through there”</p>
<p>When I pointed over my head, the girl did too. The daylight came in—–dawn came while I crushed the larvae—–the girl squinted from the brightness.</p>
<p>Her rigid face must be because she noticed the hole above. It is not a height that an ordinary human can climb. Even for a Kijin, that does not change.</p>
<p>“I’m going to escape from here”</p>
<p>The girl looks at me with round eyes.</p>
<p>“Do you have any way to get out of here?”</p>
<p>The girl frowned as if i was saying something irrational.</p>
<p>“If you want, I can get you out of here, but if you say you do not need the help of a human, then I will leave you. What will you do?”</p>
<p>The girl looked away as if perplexed.</p>
<p>“Oh, by the way, I think paralysis will not disappear for at least a day. Well, that’s just based on my experience, I wouldn’t know in the case of a Kijin”</p>
<p>The moment she heard that, the girl stared at me. I can understand that feeling. I already extended my hand to her. It depends on her whether to take it or not.</p>
<p>“For now, I will try to climb the wall. I will come once I climb halfway up, so have your answer ready by then”</p>
<p>As I walked away from the girl and after some light stretching exercises, I approached the wall.</p>
<p>The wall is practically all vertical, but there are several protrusions that protrude to have a foothold. The problem is that there is a slight angle depending on the location. It seems almost necessary to climb using only the strength of both hands on that side.</p>
<p>No matter how much energy I extend through my body, I cannot stick to the wall at a negative angle like an insect.</p>
<p>I climbed the wall with spirit. While feeling a look from behind.</p>
<p>About an hour after that, I managed to escape with the girl. It was an uneventful escape.</p>
<p>The exit was on a small cliff. The great Tittis forest spreads below my eyes, and a strong wind blows in my face.</p>
<p>I heard a small voice of thanks as if covered by the sound of the wind.</p>
<p>“T-This…..thank you …..”</p>
<p>“You’re welcome”</p>
<p>I replied to the shy voice coming from my back. By the way, this was the first time I heard the girl’s voice.</p>
<p>Earlier when I reconfirmed if she needed help, she put on a surprised face—–probably because I climbed up and down the wall—–she just nodded several times.</p>
<p>“Then, do you have a place to go? If you tell me where you live, I can take you there”</p>
<p>“…..Well”</p>
<p>It was a confused and hesitant voice. Well, even though I got her out of the hole, it is obvious that she has doubts about telling me where she lives.</p>
<p>“You can specify places like mountains, trees or rocks”</p>
<p>“In that case…..to the left, the third largest camphor tree…..”</p>
<p>“…..Sorry. As far as I can see, they all look the same size”</p>
<p>After thinking about something, the girl explained in a different way.</p>
<p>“Um, Jiraiya Oaks”</p>
<p>“…..Sorry. But I don’t know which one is Jiraiya Oaks”</p>
<p>“…..I will explain when we get down from this cliff”</p>
<p>“…..Sorry for the trouble”</p>
<p>When I bowed my head, the girl laughed.</p>
<p>“Why is the person who helped me apologizing?”</p>
<p>“I wonder why. Anyway, I’m going to run from here, so be careful not to bite your tongue”</p>
<p>After receiving an answer from the girl, I began to descend the cliff with the girl on my back.</p>
<p>On the way, I felt I heard some kind of scream in my ear, but I paid no attention to it.</p>
<p>In the midst of the scream, it sounds like lively voice of a child, as if playing, but on reflection I decided to ignore it.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>After that, we reached Jiraiya Oaks, but when I heard again, this does not seem to be a reference point to get to her house.</p>
<p>It seems that the fruit of Jiraiya Oaks has a function to neutralize toxicity. Although too acidic to be edible, it seems to work for poison.</p>
<p>In fact, the girl who ate the fruit, her mouth took the shape of “X”, and after an hour, she could recover to the point where she could walk alone.</p>
<p>The effect is like magic. Jiraiya Oaks is amazing. That’s what I thought.</p>
<p>“This…..really…..thank you …..”</p>
<p>Saying that, the girl bowed deeply. For helping her out of the lord of flies’ nest. For protecting her from the beasts of the forest until the paralysis disappeared. It seems to be a thank you for all that.</p>
<p>Thinking that Kijin bow their heads just like humans, I nodded.</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. I am very satisfied after doing some adventuring after a long time”</p>
<p>After all, for the last few years, my work consisted of collecting herbs. Now I defeated the lord of flies and saved a girl who was captured. For a lost adventurer who was expelled from the guild, it is a big step.</p>
<p>There is no direct reward because there is no request. But the merit obtained at this moment by obtaining my soul equipment exceeds even 10,000 gold coins. As I said, I was very satisfied.</p>
<p>“Well, I’m leaving now. Be careful around here”</p>
<p>I said that because I realized that if I did not leave this place, the girl would not move.</p>
<p>On the one hand, if the girl now tries to return home, she would show me where it is.</p>
<p>I will not doubt the girl’s words of thanks, nor will I misunderstand that she has full confidence just because I helped her once or twice.</p>
<p>The development of a girl feeling affection for the adventurer who saved her is just a story. Rather, it is a privilege of some famous adventurers.</p>
<p>I am included in neither, and the girl must still distrust me. It was a consideration on my part to leave this place first.</p>
<p>However.</p>
<p>“E-This!”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>The loudest volume of today came out of the girl’s mouth, I was surprised and turned around.</p>
<p>“W-What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Well, you see!”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>
<p>“Really…..thank you…..!”</p>
<p>It was the second thank you from the girl.</p>
<p>“Yes, you’re welcome…..?”</p>
<p>Seeing my face, the girl panicked, it seems I put on a confused face.</p>
<p>Then she continued with that expression.</p>
<p>“Um, I’m Suzume!”</p>
<p>“Suzume? Ahh….. Is that your name?”</p>
<p>This assumption seems to have hit the mark, the girl moved her head up and down at high speed.</p>
<p>I thought she was still cautious with me, but it seems she had some confidence to the extent that she could tell me her name. That makes me a little happy.</p>
<p>“I see. My name is Sora”</p>
<p>It is polite to tell her my name after she told me hers. So, the girl—Suzume murmured my name, “Sora….”</p>
<p>That gesture was mysteriously adorable. Despite the dirty appearance, I felt a certain charm in it.</p>
<p>After that, I parted ways with Suzume and headed towards Ishka by a downstream route.</p>
<p>It was Suzume who gave me this information; it seems her parents warned her, “Downstream is human territory, so you shouldn’t go there.”</p>
<p>In other words, if you go downstream, you’ll reach human territory.</p>





<p>There is a large river called Kale that flows near Ishka, and the upstream of this river is connected to the Tittis forest.</p>
<p>Perhaps the river I am in now is one of the several sources of Kale—I thought that way and started moving, but of course, there is no well-paved path.</p>
<p>A forest untouched by human manipulation is filled with obstacles, the river’s flow meanders, and it is not easy to progress.</p>
<p>If it were me until yesterday, I wouldn’t have lasted even an hour and would be completely exhausted.</p>
<p>I might have even been devoured by a magical beast before becoming exhausted.</p>
<p>The river water was murky, and the bottom was not visible, but there was an atmosphere that seemed to conceal an aquatic beast.</p>
<p>However, this is just a thought if it were my old self. My current self is different.</p>
<p>By strengthening my body with energy, my physical strength and leg power will improve dramatically, and I can run along the river without any problems.</p>
<p>Even if I keep running for an hour or two, there are no issues with fatigue, and the energy won’t disappear.</p>
<p>If this is also part of the power of the same source, my mouth naturally loosens to the magnitude of the power I have.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the scenery of the forest began to slowly change. Unexpectedly, it seems to be sunset time, and a scarlet color dyes the surrounding landscape. Surely the colors of the night will fill the forest.</p>
<p>I was wondering if I should set up camp around here.</p>
<p>However, even if I say I will prepare, I don’t have the tools, and there is no reason to rest if there is still no “fatigue.”</p>
<p>If I was able to get here, I can try running all night and see what my current limits are.</p>
<p>I thought about that and tried to accelerate even more.</p>
<p>And at that moment.</p>
<p>“—Don’t relax! Keep your senses alert!”</p>
<p>I could hear a voice that seemed human, and I crouched in place.</p>
<p>Upon listening carefully, I discovered that there were quite a few people moving through the forest.</p>
<p>I don’t think ordinary people would enter the forest; they are probably adventurers.</p>
<p>Well, what should I do?</p>
<p>I have been expelled from the guild, but I am not guilty of escaping or anything like that.</p>
<p>Therefore, there is no need to flee and hide from the adventurers, but many Ishka adventurers know the name “Parasite.”</p>
<p>Even if I speak, they won’t give me a friendly response. On the contrary, it would be suspicious why there is someone of level “1” in this place.</p>
<p>I thought about that and tried to ignore them, but the next voice I heard suddenly held me back.</p>
<p>“If we allow the lord of the flies to reproduce, not only Ishka but also the capital, Horus, will be at risk. That is, the entire kingdom of Canaria will be at risk. To protect our country, we must defeat it before it reproduces! Everyone, keep that in mind!”</p>
<p>In response to the leader’s words, a loud “Yes!” was heard from all around.</p>
<p>I tilted my head. For the adventurers, those were words that strongly felt rigid.</p>
<p>Thinking about it, I tried to assess the situation from the shadows. As expected, the group that was in sight was the regular army of the Canaria Kingdom.</p>
<p>“They are not adventurers, but soldiers.”</p>
<p>Why do the soldiers know about the lord of the flies’s existence?</p>
<p>The information was sourced to the adventurers’ guild by the “Falcon Sword” who escaped using me as bait, and from the guild to the kingdom.</p>
<p>The reason I can assert that is because there was a familiar face among the soldiers.</p>
<p>Long ears with golden hair. Features that I can recognize even from a distance, it’s a member of the “Falcon Sword,” Luna María.</p>
<p>“…I’m glad. Lars and the others are safe.”</p>
<p>I chuckled, curling my lips. The joy of obtaining my soul equipment faded away, and dark emotions spread from the depths of my being.</p>
<p>What I remember are the events before and after being attacked by the lord of the flies. I haven’t forgiven what happened to the “Falcon Sword.”</p>
<p>Until I arrived here, I haven’t thought about revenge because I was absorbed in the delight of my soul equipment and the satisfaction of helping Suzume, but seeing a member of the “Falcon Sword” in this way, the despair and anger of being devoured alive by the larvae have resurfaced just like the last time.</p>
<p>My body trembles. My gaze becomes sharp. In this very moment, I want to cut Luna María and the other members of the “Falcon Sword” who are surely there. That longing, which goes beyond desire, burns my mind and body, and unintentionally, I take a step forward.</p>
<p>But just before I start, I barely hold myself back. There is no doubt about wanting to cut down the “Falcon Sword,” but if I attack now, I will end up turning the Canaria soldiers into enemies. Then, I would become a criminal.</p>
<p>It would be very foolish to be pursued by them. Furthermore, considering what happened in the lord of the flies’s nest, there is no way this anger will stop just by cutting them and devouring them.</p>
<p>I will send them all further and further into the abyss. That’s what I decided.</p>
<p>“If that’s settled, then—Hey! Over here! Help me!”</p>
<p>I stopped hiding, shouted, and called for help from the group of soldiers. I didn’t forget to make my voice hoarse and change my facial expression. It’s an act I’ve acquired after escaping from the lord of the flies.</p>
<p>My idea was this. Firstly, I don’t think Lars and the others honestly informed the guild that they used me as bait.</p>
<p>Despite having the infamous name of “Parasite,” we were once comrades, and now that I’ve been expelled from the guild and become a civilian, if they report that they used me as bait, there would be severe consequences for the “Falcon Sword.”</p>
<p>There would be no way for me, as a level “1,” to escape the lord of the flies, and perhaps Miloslav would think that I’m already dead. The facts were twisted and reported for their own convenience. I calmed down and thought about giving a bad reputation to the “Falcon Sword.”</p>
<p>Even if they report the facts correctly, that’s fine. Being used as bait, I can practically condemn them as a legitimate right.</p>
<p>Ishka has a duel system; it might be a good idea to challenge Lars. It sounds very interesting to defeat him while he thinks I’m level “1” in front of everyone.</p>
<p>In any case, I am the living proof of a sin committed by the “Falcon Sword.” If they were to see the guy they used as bait, who is supposedly dead, come back alive in front of them, they would surely turn pale.</p>
<p>Luna María, who suddenly recognized me, stood frozen, her face pale, as if confirming such speculation.</p>
