<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p class="calibre5">When I opened my eyes, I found out I was in a toilet stall.</p>
<p class="calibre5">It seems I’ve managed to return to my original timeline.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I took my smartphone out of a paper bag.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“April 15th… I’ve managed to get back properly…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The date displayed on my smartphone was April 15th, six years later.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Also, my broken smartphone is working normally now.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Furthermore, the numbers on my chest had disappeared.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Good, I’m glad they’re gone.</p>
<p class="calibre5">If they had stayed, I wouldn’t have been able to go to pools or hot springs.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“For now, let’s head back to the chapel.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For me, it’s been a month, but only a minute should have passed here.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Therefore, Ha-kun and the others should still be waiting for me in the chapel.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I’ll share the memories of this past month with Harune and Ha-kun…</p>
<p class="calibre5">Before I time-traveled, my heart was filled only with a little hope and anxiety, but now it’s full of joyful memories, hopes, and dreams.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Just for that, going back to the past was worth it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">With those thoughts in my heart, I left the toilet stall.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And when I opened the door to the chapel, as expected, my husband, my sister, and my grandmother were there.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was relieved to see their faces.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Seeing familiar faces confirmed that I had safely returned.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Welcome back! You came back so quickly.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“You really returned in just a minute.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Both greeted me with smiles.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I was happy. This is indeed the world where I belong…</p>
<p class="calibre5">However, there’s one thing that’s bothering me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Hey? Why are you two sitting in seiza position???”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s harsh!” “It’s terrible!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">For some reason, the two were waiting in a seiza position. What are these two doing…?</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka-nee ordered us to do so!”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s right. Did you perhaps forget???”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Did I do that? For me, it’s been a month after all.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Speaking of which, there’s something unusual on your head, Touka.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Eh? My head? Ah! A top hat…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">There was a top hat on my head.</p>
<p class="calibre5">This is Ha-kun’s from high school, isn’t it?</p>
<p class="calibre5">When did this top hat, which belonged to high school Ha-kun, end up on my head?</p>
<p class="calibre5">It wasn’t there until just before I disappeared… Well, he is a magician after all; it must be some sleight of hand.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I picked up the top hat. Inside it was a piece of paper.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Hehehe… here, Ha-kun from the past left a message…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I stood up and placed the top hat on my husband’s head, handing him the message.</p>
<p class="calibre5">My husband chuckled as he read it.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“I never thought I’d be blessed by my past self.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The message read, ‘Congratulations on your marriage! Don’t make your bride cry!’ in bubble letters.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka-nee, were you able to meet Natsumi-nee?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Seemingly anxious for the answer, Harune stood up and ran over to me.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Yes, I met her. I fulfilled some of her lingering wishes.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I took out a photo from the paper bag and handed it to Harune.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Harune looked at the photo and began to cry.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Ah, it’s Natsumi-nee… Natsumi-nee is surrounded by sunflowers…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Hold on, isn’t that strange? Sunflowers usually start to bloom around late June, right? It’s mid-April now. Even if two months had passed, the timing doesn’t add up, does it?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“That’s because, in that world, it wasn’t just me who time-traveled. Natsumi-neesan time-traveled to May 7th during Golden Week.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Still, isn’t that odd? Even if Natsumi-san time-traveled to May 7th, her lifespan should be less than a month. How did she extend her lifespan?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Perhaps, the bodies of those who time travel only age by a minute? Isn’t that right, Grandma?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">In fact, I had spent a month in the past, but neither my nails nor my hair grew at all.</p>
<p class="calibre5">So, I took a gamble.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I had my anxieties, but I was also confident. And my gamble paid off beautifully.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Natsumi-neesan spent sixty days in the world she time-traveled to and was able to see sunflowers in full bloom on her last day.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Didn’t I tell you? Just like you said, a time traveler’s physical time only advances by one minute.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“I see. In that case, the disease would hardly progress.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Certainly, he must be surprised by Natsumi-neesan’s prank right now…</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Harune, you played the violin at your birthday party.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“…I see. That’s good to hear.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Also, we received a wedding gift from Nee-san.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“A gift? For us?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes. It seems she was creating a picture book during her time travels.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I pull a hardcover-sized picture book from the paper bag.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka, let’s look at it.”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Sure.”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ha-kun and I sit down on a bench.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Sensing the atmosphere, Harune and our grandmother discreetly leave the room to give us privacy.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, we open Natsumi-neesan’s self-made picture book.</p>

<p class="calibre5">Once upon a time, in a certain country, there were three beautiful princess sisters.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The country was famous for the fact that the king, princess, and all the people always had a smile on their faces.</p>
<p class="calibre5">One day, the eldest of the three sisters unfortunately passed away, causing the people to lose their smiles, as if under a ‘curse.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thus, smiles disappeared from the nation.</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, one day, a magician named Ouji appeared from the neighboring country.</p>
<p class="calibre5">With his magic, Ouji-sama made the people smile again, breaking the ‘curse.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thanks to this, the king, the remaining princesses, and the citizens regained their smiles and were freed from the ‘curse.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">However, the second daughter still could not smile.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And so, Ouji-sama and the second princess embarked on a long journey to bring her smile back.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Along the way, they encountered Cinderella, who was also under a ‘curse,’ and managed to break it.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They also met Snow White, who was under a similar ‘curse,’ and broke it as well.</p>
<p class="calibre5">The two continued to meet residents of fairy tales under ‘curses’ and broke them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">At the end of their long journey, Ouji-sama and the princess find the magic to heal the ‘curse.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">The magic to regain smiles was ‘love.’</p>

<p class="calibre5">Yes, by the end of their long journey, ‘love’ had blossomed between them.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thus, the princess regained her smile and married Ouji-sama.</p>
<p class="calibre5">They danced with smiles on their faces and vowed eternal love.</p>

<p class="calibre5">&mdash;&mdash;This was the last story that Nee-san left behind.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“It’s a beautiful story…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes, it’s the best story ever…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“By the way, what’s the title of this picture book?”</p>

<p class="calibre5">I close the book and check the cover.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“…Prince’s Quest…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">The title of the picture book is apparently ‘Prince’s Quest.’</p>
<p class="calibre5">It’s a perfect title for this book.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Touka, shall we dance, just like the ending of this picture book?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Yes! Let’s dance!”</p>

<p class="calibre5">And so, we stand up and slowly walk to the center of the chapel, hand in hand.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Wait a moment, Touka…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“Well, I’ve been thinking… this top hat… something seems off…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Ha-kun takes off the top hat he had been wearing.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Then, a photograph pops out from inside the hat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">I catch the photo fluttering in the air.</p>
<p class="calibre5">In the photo, Nee-san, in her patient’s gown, and I, dressed as I am now, are both showing peace signs and smiling at each other.</p>

<p class="calibre5">“Thank you, Ouji-kun…”</p>
<p class="calibre5">“What a mechanism… As expected of me…”</p>

<p class="calibre5">Then, a music box melody begins to play from the top hat.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Until the very end, he is blessing us…</p>

<p class="calibre5">We placed what we were holding in our hands on the floor.</p>

<p class="calibre5">You spoke to me of hatred and taught me the wonders of dreams.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You taught me fear and gave me love.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You gave me pain and created unbreakable bonds.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You brought sin and left blessings.</p>
<p class="calibre5">You left me with a gentle smile&mdash;and in the end, returned to my heart.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thank you. Thank you, Natsumi-neesan.</p>
<p class="calibre5">Thank you. Thank you, Ouji-kun.</p>
<p class="calibre5">And, just like my sister’s picture book, we vow eternal love&mdash;and dance with smiles.</p>

<p class="calibre5">There is no more ‘curse’ in my world&mdash;&mdash;.</p>
