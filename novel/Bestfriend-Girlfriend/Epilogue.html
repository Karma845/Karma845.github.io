<h2>Epilogue: Shimizu-san and the Starry Sky</h2>

<p>“Huh? You’re leaving before we even start stargazing?”</p>

<p>Ai-san’s voice of surprise echoes through the clubroom.</p>

<p>“Yes, I apologize. It’s getting dark, and I don’t want to send Teruno home alone.”</p>
<p>“Then why not go home after we’re done with the stargazing? Teruno-chan wants to see the stars on the school rooftop with Onii-chan too, right?”</p>
<p>“Y-yes.”</p>
<p>“Ai, don’t pressure her too much. You’re making Teruno-chan uncomfortable.”</p>
<p>“But we went to all this trouble to prepare…”</p>
<p>“I’m sorry…”</p>
<p>“No, no, it’s not Teruno-chan’s fault.”</p>

<p>Just as the atmosphere in the clubroom becomes solemn, there’s a sudden knock at the door.</p>

<p>“May I come in?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Yes, please come in.”</p>
<p>“Excuse me.”</p>
<p>“Yuasa-sensei.”</p>

<p>The person who entered the clubroom was Yuasa-sensei, the homeroom teacher for Shimizu-san, Seto-san, and me, as well as the advisor for the Astronomy Club.</p>

<p>“All five of you are here… Wait, who are you? You’re not one of my students, are you?”</p>
<p>“Um, well…”</p>

<p>Caught off guard by the sudden appearance of the teacher, Teruno becomes flustered.</p>

<p>“I’ll explain this.”</p>
<p>“Alright. Let’s talk in the hallway so as not to intimidate her.”</p>
<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>And so, Yuasa-sensei and Yousuke-san step out into the hallway.</p>

<p>“Oh, right. It’s already that time, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Do you think Yousuke-san will be okay?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, if it’s Yousuke, he’ll explain things well to the teacher.”</p>

<p>It seems that Ai-san has complete trust in Yousuke-san.</p>

<p>“Well, it’s a hundred times better than if Ai were to explain it.”</p>
<p>“True that.”</p>
<p>“You guys could have a little more faith in me, you know?”</p>
<p>“Hmph.”</p>
<p>“Did you just snort at me!?”</p>
<p>“Either way, in the end, we’ll have to follow whatever the teacher says.”</p>
<p>“That’s true.”</p>

<p>What if our stargazing plans get canceled?</p>
<p>Just as I’m contemplating this, Yousuke-san returns to the clubroom.</p>

<p>“Welcome back, Yousuke. How did it go?”</p>
<p>“I’m back. I was only asked about what happened from the time I arrived at school until now. Yuasa-sensei said he has something to take care of but will be back a bit later.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Do you think we’ll be able to go stargazing?”</p>
<p>“I don’t think you need to worry about that. Yuasa-sensei said he’d be back in time for the stargazing.”</p>

<p>Hearing Yousuke-san’s words, I feel relieved.</p>
<p>It’s good that everyone’s hard work for the midterm exams didn’t go to waste.</p>

<p>“Onii-chan, I’m sorry… You were looking forward to this, and it might be ruined because of me…”</p>

<p>Teruno seems to feel guilty as if it’s her fault that I might not be able to join the stargazing.</p>
<p>I pat her drooping head.</p>

<p>“Don’t worry about it. Thanks to everyone in the Astronomy Club, I’ve had more than enough fun today.”</p>
<p>“Hondō…”</p>
<p>“Excuse me, coming in.”</p>

<p>After a few knocks, Yuasa-sensei’s voice came from the other side of the door.</p>

<p>“Come in.”</p>

<p>Yuasa-sensei entered the clubroom with his usual gentle expression.</p>

<p>“Sorry to keep you waiting.”</p>
<p>“That’s fine, but what about the stargazing?”</p>
<p>“Before that, is it okay if I ask you something, Hondō-kun?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yes.”</p>

<p>I was a bit flustered as I was suddenly called upon.</p>

<p>“Do you want to go stargazing with everyone?”</p>
<p>“Uh, I do want to, but I have to take Teruno home…”</p>
<p>“What I’m asking is simply whether you want to go stargazing with everyone or not?”</p>

<p>I don’t understand the intention behind Yuasa-sensei’s question, but if it’s a simple yes-or-no choice, there’s only one option.</p>

<p>“…I want to go stargazing.”</p>
<p>“That’s good, then.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“I spoke with Hondō-kun’s father on the phone a moment ago, and under the condition that I drive Teruno-chan home, he agreed to let both Hondō-kun and Teruno-chan go stargazing.”</p>

<p>So that’s why he was leaving earlier.</p>

<p>“…is it okay for me to go too?”</p>
<p>“Technically, it’s against the rules. But there aren’t any other students or teachers around today, and as long as everyone keeps it a secret, it won’t be a problem. So let’s go stargazing secretly together.”</p>
<p>“Yuasa-sensei…”</p>
<p>“Sensei, you’re surprisingly mischievous.”</p>
<p>“Getting called that by the Student Council Vice-President of our school is a bit funny. Normally, I wouldn’t go this far.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Yuasa-sensei.”</p>
<p>“I didn’t expect to be thanked by Student Council President Sakata for breaking the rules. Ah, I promised Hondō-kun’s father that I would get Teruno-chan home as soon as possible, so let’s go to the rooftop right away for stargazing.”</p>
<p>” “Yes!” “</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“Wow! This is the school rooftop I’ve dreamed of seeing at night!”</p>

<p>A few minutes after leaving the clubroom, we set foot on the school rooftop.</p>

<p>“I’ve been to the door leading to the rooftop before, but it feels different actually being up here.”</p>

<p>Given that we’re in a part of the school that’s usually off-limits, both Ai-san and Yousuke-san seem more excited than usual.</p>

<p>“Hey, you guys haven’t forgotten the purpose of today, have you? We’re supposed to be stargazing.”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san is right.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san and Seto-san seem more composed than the two senpai.</p>

<p>“Alright, it’s time for stargazing. Feel free to do as you please, but don’t get too close to the fence as it’s dangerous.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>

<p>I look up at the night sky.</p>
<p>If not for the city lights, perhaps even more stars would be visible.</p>
<p>Still, there were countless stars scattered across the sky.</p>

<p>“I feel like it’s been a while since I’ve looked at the night sky like this.”</p>

<p>Before I knew it, Yuasa-sensei was standing next to me.</p>
<p>There was something I wanted to ask him.</p>

<p>“Why did you go to the extent of calling my father to get permission for stargazing?”</p>
<p>“That’s because everyone in the Astronomy Club has been working hard. I knew you all did well on your midterm exams for the sake of stargazing. I wanted to help you enjoy the fruits of your labor. Plus, Hondō-kun, you’re one of my valued students.”</p>
<p>“…Thank you very much.”</p>
<p>“You don’t have to thank me. Anyway, enjoy the stargazing since you finally get to participate with your sister.”</p>
<p>“Yes!”</p>
<p>“Let me give you this as well.”</p>

<p>I take what Yuasa-sensei pulls from his pocket.</p>
<p>It appears to be the key to the rooftop.</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough of the starry sky for now, so I’ll head back to the clubroom. Please take care of everything else.”</p>

<p>With that, Yuasa-sensei left.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>Shimizu’s POV</p>

<p>(Looking at it again, this is surprisingly beautiful.)</p>

<p>When was the last time I looked at the night sky just to see the stars?</p>
<p>While pondering this, a sudden jolt ran through my back.</p>
<p>Reflexively turning around, Ai was standing there.</p>

<p>“What are you daydreaming about, Kei-san? It’s already nighttime!”</p>
<p>“Let me look at the stars in peace.”</p>
<p>“I would love to let you do that, but haven’t you forgotten today’s goal?”</p>
<p>“That is…”</p>

<p>My goal for today was to create unforgettable memories with Hondō.</p>

<p>“If things continue this way, we’ll just end up looking at stars.”</p>
<p>“What do you suggest then?”</p>
<p>“Leave that to me. I remember the promise we made during the midterm exams. I’ll have everyone except Daiki-kun go back to the clubroom little by little. Eventually, it’ll just be you and Daiki-kun alone.”</p>
<p>“Won’t Hondō notice something’s up if we do that?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry! Daiki-kun seems engrossed in stargazing.”</p>

<p>Glancing towards Hondō, it was true; he was simply gazing at the sky alone, not talking to anyone.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you giving up something yourself?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“Don’t play dumb. Don’t you want to be alone with Yousuke?”</p>

<p>Since Ai and Yousuke are graduating from the Astronomy Club after this semester, they’d want to make the most of these rare opportunities.</p>

<p>“Well, sure, I wouldn’t mind a romantic moment with Yousuke on the rooftop at night. But I also want to support Kei’s love life. I’ve seen how hard you’ve worked since you became a sophomore.”</p>
<p>“Don’t regret this later.”</p>
<p>“I won’t regret it, not at all. Besides, I plan on making moves on Yousuke from now on.”</p>
<p>“…thank you…”</p>
<p>“Eh? Could you say that again? ‘Thank’ what?”</p>
<p>“You definitely heard me if you can say that much!”</p>
<p>“I’m just kidding, just kidding. Now that you’ve thanked me, I’ll fulfill the request, so think about what you’ll do when you’re alone with Daiki-kun.”</p>

<p>With that, Ai walked away from me.</p>

<p>“…What should I even talk about when it’s just the two of us?”</p>

<p>I dazedly said so to myself.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“Hey, Hondō.”</p>
<p>“Yes?”</p>

<p>Looking around, I noticed that the number of people had decreased.</p>
<p>Actually, aside from me, only Shimizu-san remained.</p>
<p>While I was gazing at the stars, everyone else seemed to have gone somewhere.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, do you know where everyone else went?”</p>
<p>“They said they were going back to the clubroom.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? I didn’t even notice.”</p>
<p>“Do you have the key to the rooftop?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I got it from Yuasa-sensei.”</p>

<p>I took the key out of my pocket and showed it to Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Then it’s fine.”</p>

<p>With that, Shimizu-san shifted her gaze to the night sky.</p>
<p>Or so I thought, then she turned her head back towards me again.</p>

<p>“I can’t help but notice your gaze.”</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san had been looking at the night sky, but it seemed I was too obvious when I stared at her profile.</p>

<p>“You don’t need to apologize. Did you want to say something?”</p>

<p>I was staring absentmindedly, so there was nothing I wanted to say…uh, there is something still needed to be said.</p>

<p>“Thank you for finding Teruno and being with me earlier.”</p>
<p>“…I was just returning the favor. Don’t worry about it.”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san is kind.”</p>
<p>“Why would you say that?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san shifted her gaze from the night sky to me.</p>

<p>“Because you tried not to make me feel burdened, right?”</p>
<p>“That’s just your interpretation.”</p>
<p>“Is that so? Even so, Shimizu-san’s kindness always helps me.”</p>
<p>“…say whatever you want.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san looked back at the night sky, so I decided to do the same.</p>

<p>“We’ve had a lot of experiences since joining the Astronomy Club, haven’t we?”</p>
<p>“Have we?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. Sharing our thoughts about anime and studying hard for midterms. You also started changing your hairstyle every day after joining the Astronomy Club, right?”</p>
<p>“Forget about that.”</p>

<p>For some reason, that seemed like a topic Shimizu-san didn’t want to touch on.</p>

<p>“I didn’t plan on joining any clubs when I started high school, but now I’m glad I joined the Astronomy Club.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear.”</p>
<p>“Thank you.”</p>
<p>“Why are you thanking me? Ai was the one who invited you, and you’re the one who decided to join the Astronomy Club.”</p>
<p>“That’s true, but I had fun in the Astronomy Club because of you, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Ha?”</p>
<p>“If I were the only one who had joined the Astronomy Club, I think I would have felt hesitant around everyone else. The reason I could be myself in the club was because you were always there, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“You’re saying something like that without any embarrassment…”</p>

<p>I didn’t think I was saying anything to be embarrassed about.</p>

<p>“How about you, Shimizu-san? Did you enjoy being in the Astronomy Club?”</p>
<p>“Well…”</p>
<p>“Well?”</p>
<p>“I-I guess it was a little fun. It was always noisy, though.”</p>
<p>“That’s good to hear.”</p>

<p>I felt relieved that it wasn’t just me who had a good time.</p>
<p>Somehow, I’m happy that Shimizu-san and I could share enjoyable moments.</p>
<p>What is this feeling?</p>
<p>Will the day come when I understand it?</p>

<p>“I enjoy the time I spend with everyone in the Astronomy Club, but I think I might also like these moments when it’s just the two of us, Shimizu-san.”</p>

<p>Ah, what I was thinking just came right out of my mouth.</p>
<p>Silence filled the space that was just between us.</p>
<p>I thought maybe the reason for the lack of sound was because there was no wind today.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san? It’s a bit sad if you’re going to completely ignore me…”</p>
<p>“Me too…”</p>

<p>My eyes involuntarily shifted toward Shimizu-san, eager to hear the rest of her sentence.</p>

<p>“…I never dislike the time I spend with you, either.”</p>

<p>Though her face was dim and hard to see, I could tell she was looking straight at me.</p>
<p>I felt my heart beat faster than before. It’s good that it’s nighttime; otherwise, Shimizu-san would have noticed my face turning bright red.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san…”</p>
<p>“Don’t get the wrong idea! I just said I don’t dislike it, okay!? I don’t mean anything by it!”</p>
<p>“I-I understand…”</p>

<p>What do I even understand?</p>
<p>In fact, I feel like I don’t understand anything at all.</p>

<p>After that, we sat in silence, maintaining a distance that was not too close but also not too far and stared at the night sky until Ai-san came to get us.</p>

<p>“Why are you thanking me? Ai was the one who invited you, and you’re the one who decided to join the Astronomy Club.”</p>
