<h2>Epilogue</h2>

<p>“Ooh, Awayuki ! Ootomo…! How should I make that brat pay!”  <br /> <br />A rough yell echoed in the Principal’s office at Teiou Academy. <br /> <br />“Damn it…do you know how much money and time went into that special medicine from Brain Seeker!” <br /> <br />Kongouji’s eyes were bloodshot with rage as he clutched his head, throwing his body back. <br /> <br />“Kuhaha, why are you so angry, Head Teacher? The CEO of Beach Co. said he’d give it to us for free, didn’t he?”  <br /> <br />Laughing blithely with her legs up on the desk was Principal Ougami Ai. Kongouji’s anger was also directed at her. <br /> <br />“That was because making Tera Awayuki regain her emotions with that special medicine was expected to be good PR for Brain Seeker! But in the end that brat made her laugh instead, ruining it all! The sponsor said they’d continue but the surcharge clause is now void! ” <br /> <br />“In other words, the cost is the same whether Awayuki took that capsule and cried or what happened, right?” <br /> <br />“Too naive! That’s just hindsight. Our relationship with Brain Seeker was on the verge of being completely severed! Not to mention someone knocked me out with some strange stinking gas…just remembering makes me furious! And…the problem isn’t only the immediate money…no, you could even say this is far more important.” <br /> <br />“Ah, you mean the talk about Awayuki’s talent and whatnot.”  <br /> <br />“Exactly. When Tera displays her superhuman performances, her brain is extremely active. But the one area that was abnormally silent was the limbic system – the part that controls emotions.” <br /> <br />“I see. In other words, as compensation for being born an all-around genius, she lost her emotions. And conversely, now that she has regained them–” <br /> <br />“Yes! Her genius will gradually fade away! Do you understand how enormous a loss that is for mankind…That’s why I poured my heart and soul into preparing that special medicine that would restore only her emotions while retaining her superhuman performances…yet that brat went and ruined it all!” <br /> <br />His anger was directed at Awayuki Ota once more. <br /> <br />“Personally, I think there was less than a 10% chance that medicine would’ve made Tera cry.” <br /> <br />“What are you saying? It was the crystallization of the world-famous technology of Brain Seeker. She would certainly have shed tears!” <br /> <br />“Kuhaha, it may have made her eyes water but…well, in any case Awayuki’s genius doesn’t matter.” <br /> <br />“What…? Are…are you serious, Principal? Have you lost your mind?”  <br /> <br />Kongouji’s eyes widened in shock at Ougami’s words. <br /> <br />“Hey GenGen, do you know why I scouted Awayuki in the first place?” <br /> <br />With a mischievous grin, she returned his question with one of her own. <br /> <br />“That hardly needs saying at this point. Because she is a new human who can make astonishing advancements in brain science!” <br /> <br />“I thought she’d be cute if she smiled, that’s why.” <br /> <br />“…………Huh?” <br /> <br />“Well, I heard there was this incredible person so I went to meet them, but they were so boring and just did everything perfectly that I got bored too…I’d lost interest in scouting them but then I wondered, what kind of face do they make when smiling? Wouldn’t they be cute? I became obsessed with wanting to see them smile.” <br /> <br />“W-What…so those were your reasons for recruiting Tera Awayuki?”  <br /> <br />“Yup. And it was great in reality right? No, as expected of me. My talent for discovering people, even dragging in Daikyou– Ootomo who made her smile, it’s genius isn’t it? Hm? Why the open-mouthed stare, so impressed by my keen insight?” <br /> <br />“I’m appalled! To think you scouted the esteemed Tera Awayuki for such reasons…I doubt anyone else in Japan would…And about that detestable Ootomo Youta! Are you saying you transferred him in solely to make Tera smile!?” <br /> <br />“No no, I had planned to deal with him through other channels. Him clearing that was a welcome miscalculation. His talent lies elsewhere. Want me to tell you about it GenGen?” <br /> <br />“No thank you! And please refrain from calling me that nickname I’ve asked you not to many times!”  <br /> <br />After yelling hoarsely in indignation, Kongouji pressed his hand to his forehead with a look as if he’d just chomped down on a bitter bug.  <br /> <br />“Well, the money we used for Brain Seeker was within the range of one year’s [Ten Sai budget] per person so it’s not like we’re operating at a loss…but the potential loss from Tera losing her talents is immeasurable. Some of our Japanese sponsors may withdraw from the academy…and most of all, she was the absolute [face] of our academy. It will greatly impact next year’s applicants and the school’s image itself.” <br /> <br />“Ahh, you’re so worried about stuff like that GenGen.”  <br /> <br />“You’re not worried enough, Principal! This Teiou Academy is a private school corporation. We are educators but also managers!” <br /> <br />“Calm down. Because I figured you’d say that, I had this prepared as soon as the event ended earlier–here.” <br /> <br />Ougami picked up a suitcase placed next to her desk and held it out to Kongouji.  <br /> <br />“What might this be?” <br /> <br />“Go on, open it and see.” </p>



<p>Though puzzled, Kongouji followed her instruction and reached for the suitcase latch. <br /> <br />“Wha!? T-This is…” <br /> <br />The contents were packed full of cash bundles.  <br /> <br />“139 million yen.” <br /> <br />“One hundr…” <br /> <br />“Use it however you want GenGen. To supplement the [Ten Sai budget] or implement an image rehabilitation strategy, feel free.” <br /> <br />“F-Free use…where did you get such a large amount of cash?” <br /> <br />“It’s from my pocket money.”  <br /> <br />“Wha…” <br /> <br />Kongouji was struck speechless, eyes wide. <br /> <br />“N-No, I knew you were wealthy Principal but…this is just too much…” <br /> <br />“What’s wrong? Don’t hesitate to accept it, it’s a fair price.”  <br /> <br />“Fair? What do you mean by that? Is there some reason behind this specific amount?” <br /> <br />“The exchange rate today is about 139 yen.” <br /> <br />“What you’re saying is…” <br /> <br />“Don’t understand? The answer is Tera’s expression on stage earlier.”  <br /> <br />“You say the answer but I’m completely lost…please explain a bit more concretely–” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“It was precisely a million dollar smile, wasn’t it?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Saying that, Ougami Ai herself smiled broadly.  <br /> <br />“Huh…w-wait, a smile? Are you saying that based on Tera’s smile earlier you took one million dollars, converted it to Japanese yen, and are providing 139 million from your personal assets to the academy!?” <br /> <br />“Does that seem strange?” <br /> <br />“It’s exceedingly strange! But…<em>sigh</em>…I feel I may never best you in my lifetime.”  <br /> <br />“Hey hey, don’t make that dejected face. If a student is smiling but the educators are depressed, it sets a poor example. Come on, smile GenGen.”  <br /> <br />“W-Well you have a point…like this?” <br /> <br /><em>Strained smile</em> <br /> <br />“Ahh too stiff, too stiff. Lift up the corners of your mouth more.” <br /> <br />“Hmm…how about this?” <br /> <br /><em>Nicer smile</em> <br /> <br />“One more time! Show me an expression to match Awayuki!” <br /> <br />“If you insist…take this!” <br /> <br /><em>Big smile</em>  <br /> <br />“An old man’s fake smile is supremely creepy.” <br /> <br />“I’ll kill you, you little wench!” <br /> <br />“139 yen.”  <br /> <br />“That’s too low when you’re the one who made me do it! <br /> <br />It should be the opposite, the opposite! You showed me something weird so pay me compensation! Hand it over!” <br /> <br />“Gwahahaha! Behold and marvel, you scoundrel! I swear one day I’ll drag you down from your position!” <br /> <br />Any more of this and my blood vessels might burst. Kongouji somehow steadied his breathing and directed the conversation to more practical matters. <br /> <br />“Haaa…that aside, how do you plan to handle this situation?” <br /> <br />Now that the victory conditions were fulfilled, it was unavoidable that Tera Awayuki would lose her position.  <br /> <br />Certainly the principal’s shockingly huge compensation was appreciated but even 10 or 20 million yen likely didn’t match the future value of her remaining one of the [Ten Sai]. Looking at it from a business perspective, we needed to swiftly select a new [face] of the academy.  <br /> <br />Should we choose someone from the remaining nine? …It’s true that in terms of focused talent they all surpassed Tera, but they were all also too extreme.  <br /> <br />Could any replace her, who was the embodiment of community service and beloved by all…? <br /> <br />Kongouji naturally made a face as if he’d just bitten into a bitter bug, while Ougami looked positively delighted as she raised the corners of her mouth. <br /> <br />“Ah, about that I have a little idea–“</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

A few days after the gathering, there were large posters put up around the school.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>Notice</strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>1. The victory condition of “making Tera Awayuki cry” was fulfilled – she shed tears along with a smile – therefore, Tera Awayuki shall be removed from her seat as one of the [Ten Sai].</strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>2. As a result, the one who achieved the condition, Ootomo Youta, will be recognized as the new [Ten Sai].</strong>  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>3. However, concerning behavior was observed in the process of achieving this, resulting in complaints from some parents after hearing about it.</strong> <br /> <br /><strong>An emergency motion by the student council disciplinary committee resulted in a majority vote for dismissal.</strong>  <br /> <br /><strong>Therefore, Ootomo Youta is stripped of the title of [Ten Sai].</strong> <br /> <br /><strong>The remaining seat will be temporarily vacant.</strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>4. But drawing a girl’s first-ever smile is a singular accomplishment, and his ability to capture the hearts of all students is also rare.</strong> <br /> <br /><strong>While he is judged unsuitable as a [Ten Sai], only removing his title would be unfair for the results he achieved.</strong> <br /> <br /><strong>Therefore, a new title will be established for him to bear.</strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>5. Ootomo Youta will be recognized as the first [Teiou Isshou].</strong>  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Are you kidding me!”  <br /> <br />I couldn’t help shouting loudly. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>6. That is, Ootomo Youta will be recognized as the first [Teiou Ichi(shou)].</strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Don’t specifically add parentheses like that! You’re obviously making fun of me! This is bullshit!” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>7. Accordingly, the [Teiou Jusshou] system will be newly established.</strong>  <br /> <br /><strong>Unlike the [Ten Sai] who are recognized for world-class talent by all, its purpose is discovering creative talents who don’t fit existing evaluation criteria.</strong> <br /> <br /><strong>For those who take this seat, Teiou Academy promises full support for college recommendations and post-graduation paths.</strong> <br /> <br /><strong>Details on the selection method will be announced later, but one way to immediately take a [Teiou Jusshou] seat is specified below.</strong> <br /> <br /><strong>[Being recognized by the school chairwoman as suitable for Teiou Jusshou].</strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>8. In short, we’re looking for interesting as hell guys.</strong>  <br /> <br /><strong>Kuhaha, come on you guys, try your hardest to entertain me!</strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /><strong>Teiou Academy Chairwoman, Ougami Ai</strong> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Oh, so she just played around with me then straight up made it a new system?…Isn’t that chairwoman a bit crazy… <br /> <br />“Guh, guhigigigigi!” <br /> <br />Next to me I heard the sound of tremendous teeth grinding.  <br /> <br />“Oh Ohana, what’s with the frustrated face?” <br /> <br />“Of course I’m frustrated! Why’s only Daikyou getting special treatment, it’s so unfair!” <br /> <br />“No, there’s nothing special about being the ‘Laughter’ guy…it’s just mortifying.”  <br /> <br />“Tsk tsk, you don’t get it! Whether it’s [Sai] or [Shou], if it can become a foothold to stardom then anything is good! And with nine seats open, now is the perfect chance. Hmm~ I need a good idea to entertain the chairwoman…” <br /> <br />Pressing her index finger to her temple, Ohana pondered deeply before– <br /> <br />“Ah, I know! Daikyou, want to storm the principal’s office together and show our butts? Let’s tickle the chairwoman’s belly!” <br /> <br />“No way, that’d be a huge incident if a girl like you did it…” <br /> <br />Well it’d be totally out for guys too but… <br /> <br />“Huh? Only Daikyou is showing his butt right?” <br /> <br />“What? Then what are you doing?” <br /> <br />“I’ll wipe your butt for you!” <br /> <br />Pretty clever words coming from Ohana…kinda pisses me off… <br /> <br />“No way…the moment I show it my life is over so there’s no helping it.”  <br /> <br />“Eh? Are you misunderstanding? Showing your dirty butt would be rude to the chairwoman too, so I thought I’d tidy up the surface with wet wipes and all.” <br /> <br />“You were gonna physically wipe!?” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“You two seem to be having fun.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />A familiar voice came from behind.  <br /> <br />“Ah, Tera!” <br /> <br />Like a puppy spotting its owner, Ohana leaped at Awayuki. <br /> <br />“There there. Hmm…it seems you’ve gotten yourself into quite the situation, huh Daikyou?” <br /> <br />While patting Ohana’s head, Awayuki glanced at the notice board. <br /> <br />“Yeah…well it’s just like the chairwoman but I wish she’d done this unrelated to me…it’ll interfere with my goal of living quietly…”  <br /> <br />“I think that will be difficult. Causing such a scene, whether it’s a new system or not, you’ll remain the center of attention.” <br /> <br />“Urgh…” <br /> <br />But she’s right…I can feel people’s stares even as we’re talking here…some of it’s probably from being with Awayuki but…I don’t think that’s all. <br /> <br />“Hmph, don’t worry. I’ll be active enough soon to make Daikyou’s name fade away. Oh! I know, Tera. Want to team up and aim for [Teiou Jusshou] together? Let’s tickle the chairwoman’s belly in a duo!” <br /> <br />“That sounds fun.”  <br /> <br />“Yay, I did it!” <br /> <br />Ohana’s face lit up brightly.  <br /> <br />“But it’s a nice offer, I don’t really need to become [Teiou Jusshou].” <br /> <br />“Huh? W-Why not?” <br /> <br />“For a while, more than making others laugh, I want to enjoy doing that myself.” <br /> <br />And with that, Awayuki looked to me and Ohana and– <br /> <br />“Though it happens naturally without me even being aware of it.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Flowers bloomed on her face. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Ehehe.” <br /> <br />Wha, what’s this…c, cu–  <br /> <br />“Hehe. I can’t help but have fun just being with Daikyou and Ohana.”  <br /> <br />That gap going from her usual expressionless face to this is kinda dirty. <br /> <br />“Ngh…” <br /> <br />“Ah, Daikyou. Tera is so cute it’s making you blush. There there!” <br /> <br />“Are you a grade schooler!? Th-this is just a reflex, a reflex! It’s not that I feel any particular way about Awayuki–hm?” <br /> <br />“Is that so…?” <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“I was happy though…was I wrong?” <br /> <br />Wha, what’s with this reaction…is Awayuki blushing a little too? <br /> <br />W-Wait a minute…if this isn’t a misunderstanding then…could it be that…? <br /> <br />No, I’ve never seen Awayuki that way before and for things to suddenly develop like this– <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />[Choose ] <br /> </p>

<h2>Afterwords</h2>

<p>Greetings everyone, this is Harusube Takeru.</p>



<p>Over ten years ago the first volume was released of a work titled [My Brain’s Choices are Doing Their Best to Ruin This School Love Comedy], which quite vulgarity began with an adult magazine.</p>



<p>In these past ten years, the environment surrounding publishing has changed dramatically. Countless types of harassment have emerged in society, anything with even a slight potential to hurt others is seen as evil and heavily regulated, textual content has become more restricted, and I increasingly get [Is this expression okay?] in red from proofreaders.</p>



<p>Without exaggeration, it would be impossible to publish [My Brain’s Choices are Doing Their Best to Ruin This School Love Comedy] in its original form in 2023.</p>



<p>Given such circumstances, the work I wrote [No Matter What Choices I Make, These SS-Rank Beauties Do Their Best to Pay Attention to Me] is…yeah, it starts with an adult magazine too.</p>



<p>The moral is that regulations cannot restrain human nature.</p>



<p>However, it is a fact that the breadth of textual expression has narrowed, and the constraints and restrictions placed on us authors grow stricter with each passing year.</p>



<p>But whether that means we are less able to write interesting works is another issue entirely.</p>



<p>If a certain phrasing or development is prohibited, I can try it like this instead…oh, it reveals a new side of the character! There are discoveries like that, and some people actually get more excited by being restrained and restricted to begin with, so–oh, I’ve started talking physically again so let’s get back on track.</p>



<p>The point is exploring alternate forms of expression, for example, pen*s.</p>



<p>Blocking it out may make some think it’s chocolate or Czech, so to be clear I mean pen*s.</p>



<p>Including words like pen<em>s and pen</em>s in the story itself is not a problem.</p>



<p>Or rather it may be a problem, but it can still get published.</p>



<p>However that’s the current situation, and by around 2030 it may become prohibited.</p>



<p>The reason being vulgarity, so replacing it with something more refined solves that.</p>



<p>Mr. Pen*s. Yes, this should be safe until around 2035.</p>



<p>Making it even more honorific with Sir Pen*s probably keeps it good until 2040.</p>



<p>If one character of refinement buys five more years, by making it [Sir Pen*s’ throb~bing~] we’ll be safe until 2070.</p>



<p>But it’s troublesome to have to write [the throb~bing~ of my Sir Pen<em>s] in 2070 when now I could just say [my pen</em>s], and for a hypothetical scene of the protagonist joking around with his male friend at a public bath saying [my pen<em>s is throb~bing~!], in 2070 it becomes the incomprehensible [the throb~bing~ of my Sir Pen</em>s is throb~bing~!].</p>



<p>Yeah, if it gets to that point I’ll quit as an author.</p>



<p>Everyone, do you understand what I’m saying? I’m starting to lose track myself.</p>



<p>Oh right, I was talking about regulations.</p>



<p>Their influence extends beyond the text itself to titles as well.</p>



<p>Works that could be published in the past may become prohibited in the future. Let me test it out with some of my own titles.</p>



<p>First is [Aiming to be a Million Seller with a Beautiful Girl Author Ahhhhhhhh!!!]</p>



<p>This one is probably the most dangerous. The screaming at the end does kinda sound ecstatic doesn’t it.</p>



<p>If someone said this title was for a sexy parody video of a work called [Aiming to be a Million Seller with a Beautiful Girl Author], wouldn’t that make complete sense? I’m starting to be unable to think of it as anything but that.</p>



<p>Next is [After This it’s an Utter Love Comedy]</p>



<p>Well the original basis for this one is already prohibited. Completely prohibited.</p>



<p>I’m surprised this title even got approved back then…good kids who don’t understand should never ask Professor Google. Don’t search for [After This it’s an Utter ~] okay? Don’t do it, absolutely!</p>



<p>Moving on to [My Brain’s Choices are Doing Their Best to Ruin This School Love Comedy]</p>



<p>It prominently features in the title as well as the content.</p>



<p>At first glance there seems to be no issue, but the kanji [Ja]…doesn’t it seem kinda erotic? I can’t explain it well but in the ja~yokoshima sense, I think whoever created that kanji was a genius.</p>



<p>If kanji were anthropomorphized, Ja-chan would definitely be naughty!</p>



<p>Everyone, do you understand what I’m saying? I’m starting to lose track myself.</p>



<p>Oh right, I was talking about regulations.</p>



<p>This afterword itself serves as a touchstone–to test whether this level of joking around is permitted in 2023.</p>



<p>If you’re reading this then it was a great success.</p>



<p>It’s the opposite version of that common [If you’re seeing this video, I must already be dead].</p>



<p>If I unfortunately get an NG and incur Kadokawa’s wrath, my career as an author may end here–uwanaido what cancel</p>



<p>This is Harusube’s agent. The acknowledgements begin here.</p>



<p>Editor S, thank you for being a man! In these times, sending an afterword like this to a female editor might get me accused of harassment just for asking if it’s acceptable.</p>



<p>But even with the same sex, discomfort could still constitute harassment I heard–uwanaido what cancel</p>



<p>This is Harusube’s agent’s agent. The acknowledgements continue.</p>



<p>Illustrator Shio Kazuno, Hanako was silly cute, Korone was sexy cute, Kongouji sch–I mean Terra was Terracute! Oh right, the principal didn’t get an illustration. Every girl vastly exceeded my imagination with cuteness, thank you so much!</p>



<p>Thank you to everyone involved in the printing, distribution, and sales of this book.</p>



<p>And most of all, thank you to the readers.</p>



<p>And with that, praying we meet again in the next volume,</p>



<p>Harusube Takeru (Agent’s Agent), May 2023</p>

<p>TL Note:</p>



<p id="isPasted">What a fun novel! Reading this feels like being back in the early 2010s. Dang, I feel old.</p>



<p>For the next translation, I want to read another novel that evokes the feel of the 2010s. Hopefully, there’s one available on the translation request page.</p>



<p>With all that said, see you in volume 2 when it come out in the future</p>
