<h2>Epilogue: The Next Morning</h2>

<p>“Osaki… Sumire-san, for me…”</p>

<p>I stopped there, stumbling over my words.</p>
<p>I was searching for words to describe the relationship between Sumire Osaki and me.</p>
<p>It was too fateful to call her an acquaintance, not easy enough to be called friends, and not sweet and sour enough to be called an ex-girlfriend.</p>
<p>It wasn’t any of those.</p>

<p>“…Sumire-san is my first love.”</p>
<p>“Shinichi-kun…!”</p>
<p>“To avoid hurting Sumire-san, when I become the president, I would like to establish a business partnership. Please, consider it.”</p>

<p>It wasn’t a threat. It was a positive proposal.</p>
<p>Well, maybe I’m being too cocky? Oh well, it doesn’t matter. At this point, I have to follow through on everything I’ve said. I confidently threw the listening device into the pool. …It would be lame if it was waterproof.</p>

<p>“Hey, Shinichi-kun?”</p>

<p>Sumire Osaki in front of me smiled with tears in her eyes.</p>

<p>“Did you just put on a heavier shackle than marrying me?”</p>
<p>“Maybe. But…”</p>

<p>With a face as if chewing on bitter medicine, I honestly expressed my thoughts.</p>

<p>“If Sumire Osaki ends up in an unwanted marriage because of me, it’ll be an even worse wake-up call.”</p>
<p>“Oh, how sincere of you. But, you don’t need to worry. Shinichi-kun.”</p>

<p>Sumire Osaki, my first love and my first and last lover, imitated someone and smiled brightly.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>There is no endless night; morning will always come. Even if it’s a regrettable night or an undesired morning.</p>
<p>On the top floor of Roppongi Sky Tower, in the hallway of the residential floor, I found an open door and stopped in front of it.</p>
<p>It was Osaki Sumire’s room. It had just been emptied overnight.</p>

<p>“How are you, Shinichi-sama?”</p>
<p>“Ah… well.”</p>

<p>I noticed that Juujo-san was standing next to me.</p>

<p>“…It’s like my decision really affected her life.”</p>
<p>“Kaede-sama.. It’s just as your mother said when she was alive.”</p>

<p>Juujo-san spoke, probably imitating my mother’s tone, saying,</p>
<p>“Shinichi always cares too much about others.'”</p>

<p>“My mother said such a thing…”</p>
<p>“But, Shinichi-sama. Did choosing someone else really make Osaki Sumire-sama happier?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>I tilted my head in surprise at the sudden question.</p>

<p>“What do you think? For Osaki-sama, which would bring more happiness, ‘a life with Shinichi-sama’ or ‘a life without Shinichi-sama’?”</p>

<p>“That’s a mean question…”</p>

<p>However, the answer came surprisingly easily, and I even laughed at it myself.</p>

<p>“…’A life without me,’ I guess.”</p>

<p>“Well, I don’t really know. Osaki-sama might get angry if she hears this, but that’s the flow of your answer.”</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>

<p>Now, is this going towards “That’s right. So, Shinichi-sama’s decision wasn’t wrong”?</p>

<p>“What I want to say is, there’s no point in imagining parallel worlds where you made different decisions in the past. Humans can’t go back to the past, no matter how hard they try.”</p>

<p>Juujo-san, unusually talkative, continued speaking.</p>

<p>“What’s important is to ensure that your decisions don’t turn into regrets and to move the present and future in a positive direction. As long as you end up smiling in the end, everything before that becomes ‘something good.’ That applies to you, Shinichi-sama, and of course, to Osaki-sama. From now on, Osaki-sama’s life is something she will carve out for herself. Or does Shinichi-sama think Osaki-sama is incapable of carving out a future without Shinichi-sama?”</p>

<p>“Another tricky question…?”</p>
<p>“You shouldn’t answer a question with another question. It’s basic etiquette for adults.”</p>
<p>“Sigh…”</p>

<p>I chewed on that conversation once again and confidently responded this time.</p>

<p>“…If it’s Sumire, she’ll find happiness on her own.”</p>

<p>To my answer, Juujo-san smiled back this time.</p>

<p>“Well, Sumire-sama might still get angry at that answer, but nevertheless, it’s necessary for Shinichi-sama to say so.”</p>

<p>It was a somewhat confusing yet strangely convincing conversation, and I felt relieved.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Juujo-san.”</p>

<p>And then, a grin appeared on my lips.</p>

<p>“Juujo-san, you seem quite compassionate, don’t you?”</p>

<p>As if teasing her, I threw out a little provocation.</p>

<p>“Well, all of it is just Kaede-sama’s influence—or rather, what’s written here.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>Juujo-san had another surprising trump card. She handed me a worn-out A4 sheet.</p>

<p>“Is this for real…?”</p>
<p>“It is.”</p>

<p>On the received paper, there was something like ‘Anticipated Q&amp;A after Shinichi eliminated the first bride candidate,’ and underneath, only Sumire’s name part of the conversation I just had was blank, marked as ‘(Name of the eliminated girl).’ In my lines, not every word, but almost everything I said now matched.</p>

<p>“This is so dangerously accurate… mother…”</p>
<p>“Even from the perspective of a son, wouldn’t you think so?”</p>
<p>“Yes, from the bottom of my heart.”</p>

<p>Too dangerous. Is she a prophet…?</p>

<p>“Now, the bride candidates are waiting. Let’s go.”</p>
<p>“…Yes.”</p>

<p>I temporarily put my deep respect for my mother in my pocket, straightened my collar, and walked in front of Juujo-san. When we went up to the rooftop in the elevator, the five were there to welcome us.</p>

<p>“It’s incomprehensible. Why are Onii-chan and Jujoo-san coming up together?”</p>

<p>Maon Hirakawa frowned at her.</p>

<p>“Maon-chan is right, Shinichi? I wonder what you and Jujoo-san were talking about?”</p>

<p>Shinagawa Sakiho puffs out her cheeks,</p>

<p>“Your expression has softened quite a bit compared to last night, Hirakawa. Feeling a bit better?”</p>

<p>After Reona Kanda looked into my face, she smiled wisely</p>
<p>Meguro Ria, after peeking into my face, smiled with a serene expression and said,</p>
<p>“Of course! It would be troublesome if Shin didn’t choose us with all his might! Shin needs to choose us with a different approach that others can’t do! I’ll comfort you in a way that others can’t!”</p>

<p>Shibuya Yuu hit my back forcefully.</p>

<p>“Shinichi-kun, are you feeling a bit better? You can show me your weak side that you can’t show in front of everyone, okay? I’ll comfort you in a way others can’t!”</p>
<p>“Shinichi-kun, you seem a bit vacant. Can I comfort you in a way others can’t?”</p>
<p>Said Meguro Ria, holding my hands, looking up at me with a suggestive gaze.</p>

<p>“…Ah, I’m already fine.”</p>

<p>‘If you want to go fast, go alone; if you want to go far, go together.’ In any case, there’s no time to stop.</p>


<p>And in the refreshing atmosphere completely devoid of sentimentality on the rooftop,</p>

<p>“Thank you all for gathering here.”</p>

<p>Juujo-san, with a slight lift at the corners of her serious mouth, said.</p>

<p>“Now, let’s begin the rules explanation for Season 2.”</p>
