<h2>Epilogue</h2>


<p>“Um, Master, is this really alright?”</p>
<p>“Hm? What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“Well… Is it okay for me to have a room?”</p>
<p>“Of course, no problem. I mean, it would be a waste not to use it since there’s more space.”</p>
<p>As I said that, Seal blinked in confusion. Suzume, who stood beside her, wore a similar expression. Meanwhile, Luna Maria observed the scene, her hand resting against her cheek.</p>
<p>Yep, well, I can see that they’re all perplexed. And truth be told, so am I.</p>
<p>This is a luxurious residential area in the northern part of Ishka. And what stood before us was a grand mansion that could comfortably accommodate about twenty people.</p>
<p>—It appears that this will be my new home from now on. It’s not a rented property; the house and the land rights belong to me. Well, yes, it’s bound to confuse anyone.</p>





<p>“I suppose I underestimated the association… To think they would grant me ownership of this mansion.”</p>
<p>That pretty much sums it up.</p>
<p>Following our recent negotiations, Fiodor accepted the terms I offered. We weighed the pros and cons of pursuing Suzume, as well as the advantages and disadvantages of becoming my enemy. After careful consideration, he chose to take hold of my outstretched hand.</p>
<p>With this, my relationship with the association has become a gamble. It’s a precarious situation, much like shaking hands with the right hand while holding a knife with the left. However, I take pride in knowing that it’s the best way to protect Suzume.</p>
<p>That may be all well and good, but it seems that Fiodor views me as some sort of opportunist. Nevertheless, I’ve made various investments in establishing this collaboration, and this mansion is one of them.</p>
<p>“Um, Sora-san…”</p>
<p>“What is it, Suzume?”</p>
<p>“Is it really okay for me to live here? Won’t I be a burden?”</p>
<p>“Not at all. I want to be with you, Suzume.”</p>
<p>“Ah… uh… I-I see.”</p>
<p>Suzume responded with a blush and quickly withdrew, no longer showing signs of embarrassment after our battle with the Basilisk. Luna Maria, watching Suzume’s reaction, spoke up.</p>
<p>“Master, it’s not just limited to the association. Whenever you take or request something from a large organization, you risk losing your freedom. Please proceed with caution.”</p>
<p>“Yes, I’m aware. At first, I thought of refusing—”</p>
<p>“Really?”</p>
<p>“Yes, but after seeing that bathroom, I couldn’t turn it down.”</p>
<p>As I spoke those words directly, Luna Maria blinked several times in surprise.</p>
<p>“If it’s about the bathroom, why not use the public baths?”</p>
<p>“Going in a group can be nice, but personally, I prefer to bathe alone. Besides, the public baths are all steam baths. I don’t feel truly refreshed unless I can soak my body in a hot water-filled tub.”</p>
<p>When I mentioned this to Fiodor, I initially thought the idea of having a cypress wooden bath was a joke. Yet, unsurprisingly, the association managed to fulfill my request within half a day.</p>
<p>Well, I suppose it’s only natural to ask for certain accommodations in this situation.</p>
<p>“It’s been five years since I last bathed in a tub with the scent of wood! When I first laid eyes on it, I thought it would be challenging to fill and heat a tub of that size. However, thanks to the Kale River, I can pour any amount of water I want, and with the help of Luna Maria’s summoned salamander, we can heat the water without the need for firewood. It’s simply perfect!”</p>
<p>As I spoke, the tension in the room rose, and before I knew it, the three of them had expressions of astonishment, their mouths slightly agape. Damn it, I might have gotten a little too carried away.</p>
<p>Ahem, I coughed lightly and tried to divert their attention.</p>
<p>“Well, putting the bathroom aside for now, it’s beneficial to have a solid base like this clan. And working with the association is advantageous.”</p>
<p>The unexpected events involving the rotten sea and the Basilisk have propelled my plan forward. My plan—a quest for revenge against “Falcon Sword” and the adventurer’s guild.</p>
<p>By publicizing my achievement in defeating the Basilisk, I can provoke Lars and further advance my plan. The same tactic can be applied to the guild, and this achievement can provide me with additional leverage.</p>
<p>A small chuckle escaped my throat as I contemplated the future.</p>
<p>Observing me in this state, Luna Maria and the others couldn’t help but feel perplexed.</p>
