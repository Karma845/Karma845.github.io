<h3>Epilogue</h3>



				
<p>Some time passed, and it was now the morning of the high school entrance ceremony. Yuuma was eating breakfast in his high school uniform.</p>



<p>From today onwards, Yuuma will be a high school student. A new life was about to begin.</p>



<p>However…Yuuma was not so interested in that.</p>



<p>&#8220;I…did I do something wrong to Yui…?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? Is that so?&#8221;</p>



<p>Ever since that sleepover, Yui has been acting strangely.</p>



<p>When he first went back to meet her, her face was in a mix of panic. She couldn&#8217;t look him in the face and used the online chat more often than not.</p>



<p>There were many instances of physical intimacy, which often troubled Yuuma, but now, she was somewhat distancing herself…not to mention lightly running away. Honestly, he felt lonely.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hey, hey, you should finish your breakfast soon. At this rate, you&#8217;ll never get it done.&#8221;</p>



<p>He tried talking to Nene about it, but she wouldn&#8217;t tell him anything, saying, 『It&#8217;s against my personal rules to answer that question.』</p>



<p>&#8220;Then, I&#8217;m going.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nene was supposed to come to the entrance ceremony, but before that, she needed to clean this and that at the store, so she left the house first. Yuuma went to see Nene off at the entrance in her suit.</p>



<p>&#8220;Don&#8217;t forget to lock the door.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I know, I know. Then, I&#8217;ll be going. Take care.&#8221;</p>



<p>Just before leaving the house, Nene glanced back at Yuuma.</p>



<p>&#8220;Hmm? What&#8217;s wrong?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;…….Why girls avoid boys. It&#8217;s not always because they don&#8217;t like them, okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh? What do you mean?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I don&#8217;t know.&#8221;</p>



<p>Nene went on giggling as she left the house.</p>



<p>She isn&#8217;t avoiding me because she doesn&#8217;t like me? He thought about it for a while, but no answer came, so he tried going back to the living room.</p>



<p>Bing Bong.</p>



<p>He heard the intercom ring.</p>



<p>Onee-chan? Did she forget something, perhaps? He thought so and opened the door──.</p>



<p>White face and light red eyes. And…dressed in a high school uniform that Yuuma will be attending from today. Standing there was none other than Yui.</p>



<p>&#8220;Ah…&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui looks up at Yuuma with a face as if a pigeon had been hit by a peashooter, as if she didn&#8217;t expect the door to suddenly open.</p>



<p>And then, at that moment, she started squirming.</p>



<p>She was in a fluster, trembling nervously. As if they were meeting for the first time.</p>



<p>But still, she did her best to look at Yuuma&#8217;s face…but the moment she looked into his eyes, right away, her face turned red, and she looked away.</p>



<p>&#8220;G-Good morning…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;G-Good morning. What&#8217;s wrong? You said you were going with your parents for the school entrance ceremony.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;U-Un…b-but, um…&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui, who was about to say something, suddenly fell silent. A subtle air seemed to flow between the two of them.</p>



<p>(I don&#8217;t know, it&#8217;s not awkward or anything, it&#8217;s more like…..I can&#8217;t quite put it into words, but it&#8217;s itchy)</p>



<p>&#8220;Your uniform looks good on you.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;!?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui turned red to the ears and blatantly looked away. Unable to stand the silence, he tried to compliment her, but it seemed to have the complete opposite effect.</p>



<p>However, Yui&#8217;s gaze will come back here again after a while. She glanced at him repeatedly and then looked at Yuuma with upturned eyes.</p>



<p>&#8220;Um, that, you know…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Eh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;Y-Yuuma…looks good too, you know?&#8221;</p>



<p>He felt his face heat up. He desperately tightened his mouth, which would smirk if he even let his guard down a little.</p>



<p>&#8220;T-Thank you…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;I-It&#8217;s my pleasure…&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;N-Now that I think about it, it&#8217;s pretty embarrassing seeing each other in uniform like this.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-That&#8217;s…right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;So, what&#8217;s really going on? I mean, you&#8217;re all alone. Are you really okay?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;E-Erm. Well…you know? Um, that…&#8221;</p>



<p>She started trembling nervously once again.</p>



<p>Yui tried to take out her smartphone…and stopped midway. Putting her smartphone back into her bag, she took a deep breath. Looking up at Yuuma as if determined.</p>



<p class="has-text-align-center"><img src="https://lh4.googleusercontent.com/kalPDNLvROgWt9BpV_xkrKYvWCFbHYEf3UVkMLdfn1lHn2OqmMOOuS9xX307vy5zWVVhIRg-CSUcZBBNa4PuSasDOwad4efOZm2D9EpHtl5zToFWYDcDslSFHWpfnSzo4eNFPaZ1RBeOm6t8NA" width="624" height="891"></p>



<p>&#8220;I-It&#8217;s the first day of school. D-Do you want to go with me?&#8221;</p>



<p>She was quite embarrassed, her face red and body trembling. But, he found such a thing cute and felt his heart jump once again.</p>



<p>&#8220;T-That&#8217;s right. Then, let&#8217;s go together. I&#8217;ll go and lock up, so just wait here a minute.&#8221;</p>



<p>──Seeing that, I couldn&#8217;t stand it anymore and ran back into the house.</p>



<p>Something was different from back then. She&#8217;s talking like before, but for some reason…I&#8217;m feeling more nervous than I was earlier.</p>



<p>After drinking a cup of water and somehow calming down somewhat, they left the house together.</p>



<p>High school train commute. They walked side by side on the street to the station.</p>



<p>&#8220;G-Going to school on the first day is pretty nerve-wracking, huh?&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;T-That&#8217;s right.&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;………&#8221;</p>



<p>&#8220;………&#8221;</p>



<p>The conversation was awkward, and eventually, they both fell silent.</p>



<p>What should I talk about? The silence has been going on for some time now. Although…I didn&#8217;t dislike it.</p>



<p>When he glanced at Yui, his eyes similarly met hers, who was also looking at him.</p>



<p>They both looked away in a hurry, and walked in silence.</p>



<p>But still, he was worried about Yui, and he glanced at her once again.</p>



<p>──It was then.</p>



<p>He noticed that Yui&#8217;s hand was fidgeting strangely.</p>



<p>She looked at Yuuma&#8217;s hand, tried to reach for it, and then retracted it over and over again.</p>



<p>(…By some chance, does she maybe want to link our hands together?)</p>



<p>Such a thought crossed his mind.</p>



<p>Ever since that sleepover, Yui doesn&#8217;t link our arms anymore, let alone try to do anything even.</p>



<p>Does she want to link arms again? But, what if I&#8217;m mistaken? Such thoughts were swirling around in his head.</p>



<p>──I&#8217;ve decided.</p>



<p>He grabbed Yui&#8217;s hand as it was extending towards him. Causing Yui&#8217;s shoulders to jump.</p>



<p>Halfway, he clasped her hand forcefully. If Yui grabs my hand back, it&#8217;s a great success. If she runs away, it&#8217;s a massive failure. It was like waiting for the results as if a defendant was waiting for their verdict. Then──</p>



<p>Yui&#8217;s hand slipped away from Yuuma&#8217;s hand.</p>



<p>(Now I&#8217;ve done ittttttt!!)</p>



<p>He screamed in his mind, though he didn&#8217;t show it outwardly. By now, he already felt like running away. But…</p>



<p>This time, it was Yui who held Yuuma&#8217;s hand.</p>



<p>Moreover, the way they held hands was different compared to a while ago.</p>



<p>Their fingers intertwined with one another, the so-called…lovers&#8217; connection. They had linked arms before, but never the lovers&#8217; connection.</p>



<p>His face felt hot. He couldn&#8217;t look at Yui&#8217;s face properly anymore. Yui seemed to be looking in the opposite direction from Yuuma. Even she appeared to be embarrassed, her ears a deep red.</p>



<p>&#8220;…If it&#8217;s embarrassing, do you want to let go?&#8221;</p>



<p>Yui shook her head vigorously at Yuuma&#8217;s words.</p>



<p>As if to say, 『I don&#8217;t want to leave』, Yui&#8217;s small hand grasps Yuuma&#8217;s hand even tighter.</p>



<p>In response to this, Yuuma also tightly clasped Yui&#8217;s hand in return.</p>



<p>Fortunately, they left early, so they had plenty of time.</p>



<p>They walked slowly along the road to the station.</p>
