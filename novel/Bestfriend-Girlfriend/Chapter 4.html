<h2>Chapter 4: Aria Comes to School</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>It was a few days after discovering that Yorka’s sister was Aria-san.</p>



<p>In the classroom, during our homeroom period in Class 2-A, announcements were being made.</p>



<p>Kanzaki Shizuru-sensei, the beautiful teacher whose voice was soothing and sounded professional, efficiently delivered administrative announcements to the class.</p>



<p>Although she exuded intellectual aura and a cool demeanor, her attentiveness to each student was always meticulous. She often noticed students who were quietly struggling and provided careful support. Her popularity among students was undeniable.</p>



<p>“We’re approaching the end-of-term exams. For those who don’t want to spend their summer vacation in supplementary classes, please make sure you’re prepared,” she announced in her usual composed manner.</p>



<p>However, unless it was just my imagination, Kanzaki-sensei looked a bit down today. A hint of fatigue was visible on her typically calm face, which was unusual for someone who always maintained a flawless demeanor.</p>



<p>“…..”</p>



<p>“That’s all for today’s announcements. Class representative, you may proceed.”</p>



<p>“…..” </p>



<p>“Sena-san?”</p>



<p>She called out my name, and our eyes met.</p>



<p>“Homeroom is over. Please dismiss the class. Or do you have something else to ask?” </p>



<p>There was a faint chuckle among the students.</p>



<p>Since declaring my relationship with Yorka, whenever I let my guard down, the teacher would tease me in a deadpan manner.</p>



<p>“Oh, then I’d like to know the answers to the final exam.”</p>



<p>My quick comeback was met with enthusiastic agreement from my classmates. </p>



<p>“Agreed!” </p>



<p>“Now we don’t have to cram all night!” </p>



<p>“Nice one, class rep!”</p>



<p>“Don’t talk nonsense; you should study instead. That goes for everyone else too. You won’t have time to play next summer with university entrance exams looming. That’s why I want you all to make the most of your second-year summer, whether it’s studying or having fun. …But please don’t rush things.”</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei advised with an oddly heartfelt tone, eliciting a chorus of “Yes!”</p>



<p>“If you have any questions, I’ll answer them later. That’s all,” she concluded.</p>



<p>I gave the final dismissal, and with that, the class was over.</p>



<p>“I saw you were spacing out. What’s wrong?” Yorka, in her summer uniform, approached my desk.</p>



<p>She wore a white blouse with the school vest on top, a pleated skirt paired with knee-high socks even in the summer. Her ribbon was neatly tied around her neck. Even in lighter attire, her meticulous nature shone through.</p>



<p>“Just thinking about how little time we have until the final exam.”</p>



<p>I noticed the circle of students already surrounding Kanzaki-sensei at the podium. But there was something off about her today, a shadow loomed over her face.</p>



<p>“Kisumi, how long are you going to stare at that teacher’s face?” </p>



<p>“Something seems off about her, don’t you think?”</p>



<p>“Maybe she’s not feeling well?”</p>



<p>Yorka looked uninterested and grabbed my hand, leading me out of the classroom.</p>



<p>As usual, Yorka was still harsh towards Kanzaki-sensei.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>“Yor-senpai, Ki-senpai, I need your help! I’m in big trouble for the final exam! Please teach me again!” As we reached the stairwell, a junior emerged from the shadows and pleaded.</p>



<p>Waiting for us was Yukinami Sayu, a first-year student who entered Eisei High School this year. She was my junior from middle school.</p>



<p>Her milk-tea-colored hair fell to her shoulders, with lively curls at the ends reflecting her energetic personality. She had sparkling eyes, glossy lips, and a delicate necklace adorned her neckline. Her healthy, long legs shone through her shortened skirt.</p>



<p>She was a modern high school girl who wore uniforms in her own way and enjoyed fashion.</p>



<p>“Isn’t the order of who you’re addressing a bit off?”</p>



<p>“Studying won’t be a problem with Yor-senpai around. Ki-senpai is just an extra.” The cute yet blunt junior didn’t hold back with her words.</p>



<p>“You only managed to pass because I organized a study session with the Sena Club during midterm before.”</p>



<p>“Pfft! You hated the idea of Sena Club so much but now that you’ve gained a bit of power, you act all high and mighty. Being too self-important will make you unpopular, you know.”</p>



<p>What kind of power did I gain from being the organizer of a gathering among friends?</p>



<p>“Don’t be openly critical.”</p>



<p>“It’s because Ki-senpai only takes credit for things that didn’t matter.”</p>



<p>“Saying harsh things like that is much worse.” We continued our banter back and forth.</p>



<p>“Alright, alright, enough bickering. So, Sayu-chan, what’s troubling you this time?” Yorka, who couldn’t stand it anymore, intervened.</p>



<p>“There’s no need to help such a cheeky junior like her.”</p>



<p>“Sayu-chan reached out to me for help, so it’s fine.”</p>



<p>“Isn’t after school supposed to be our time alone?”</p>



<p>“We’re just going to study together at a family restaurant. It won’t change anything even if Sayu-chan joins us.”</p>



<p>Understanding my playful remark, Yorka casually brushed it off. </p>



<p>She had become more relaxed even when interacting with people other than me. Of course, the fact that she and Sayu often met in Sena Club gatherings played a significant part.</p>



<p>It made me happy to see Yorka could effortlessly engage in conversation with someone she had recently met, and that Sayu felt comfortable enough to rely on her.</p>



<p>“Yor-senpai, you’re amazing! You’re dependable as always!”</p>



<p>In the end, Sayu joined us at our usual family restaurant. Just as we chatted while leaving the school gate, a taxi pulled up in front of us.</p>



<p>“Oh, did you come all the way to pick me up?” </p>



<p>Gracefully stepping out of the taxi was an incredibly stunning woman, so beautiful that it took my breath away. Her small face made her oversized sunglasses appear even larger. With her striking figure and fashionable attire, she resembled a model or celebrity.</p>



<p>Confused as to why this mysterious beauty was speaking to us so casually, both Sayu and I exchanged puzzled glances, silently asking each other, <em>“Do you know her?” </em></p>



<p>However, Yorka’s reaction was different.</p>



<p>“W-why are you here?” Yorka stuttered like a malfunctioning robot.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong? Aren’t you excited? Shouldn’t you be running over for a joyous hug?” </p>



<p>The beautiful woman removed her sunglasses, revealing her true identity as Yorka’s older sister—Arisaka Aria.</p>



<p>“What th──!?” I blurted out in utter disbelief.</p>



<p>Her appearance was worlds apart from the casual attire at home or the unassuming outfits she wore as a cram school tutor. </p>



<p>Her long hair was neatly styled, and her facial features, which were resembling Yorka’s, were accentuated by makeup, emphasizing her glamorous allure. </p>



<p>She wore a form-fitting sleeveless summer knit top that accentuated her femininity, paired with a high-end brand belt around her waist. Her stylish long skirt, made of different materials, subtly revealed the lower half of her legs, highlighting her slender ankles adorned with a golden anklet. The high heels of her mules add to her stature.</p>



<p>It was a casually elegant ensemble at first glance, but her outstanding beauty and figure captivated everyone’s attention.</p>



<p>Aria-san effortlessly carried herself in high-quality clothing and impeccable makeup, exuding a radiant aura akin to a Hollywood star.</p>



<p>The sudden appearance of such an exceptional beauty caused a stir among the surrounding students, with whispers speculating if there was a TV shoot happening at the school.</p>



<p>Sayu, seeing Aria-san up close, was overwhelmed by her beauty and left speechless.</p>



<p>“Why are you here at school?” Yorka inquired.</p>



<p>“I just came to see Shizuru-chan.”</p>



<p>Shizuru-chan referred to our homeroom teacher, Kanzaki Shizuru. She was also Aria-san’s teacher when she attended this school.</p>



<p>“I-I haven’t heard about that.”</p>



<p>“That’s because I didn’t say anything. I just suddenly had some free time.”</p>



<p>It seemed Aria-san had decided on a whim to take a taxi and visit her former teacher on a weekday evening. And of course, she had to dress up impeccably for the occasion. She was as unconventional as ever.</p>



<p>“By the way, aren’t you acting a bit distant, Yor-chan? It makes me lonely to see you being formal and stuff.”</p>



<p>“Well, it’s a bit awkward when family suddenly shows up..”</p>



<p>I could totally understand. It was embarrassing for high schoolers when their relatives popped up out of nowhere in front of their friends. I distinctly remember last year’s school festival when my little sister was all over the place with excitement while being dragged around by our parents. I wished she’d cut me some slack back then.</p>



<p>There was just something unsettling about having your family see you in your school environment. </p>



<p>And to top it off, the incredibly eye-catching Arisaka Aria was naturally drawing everyone’s attention. Even passing students stopped in their tracks, surrounding us with curious gazes. </p>



<p>Yorka looked genuinely troubled. Even though she was happy to see her big sister, she couldn’t just relax with all these people watching.</p>



<p>“Well, I’m really excited to see you!”</p>



<p>Meanwhile, Aria-san, who didn’t seem to care about the attention, was enjoying herself, completely unperturbed by the surrounding stares.</p>



<p>To anyone’s eyes, they were the picture-perfect beautiful sisters. But their vibes couldn’t be more different.</p>



<p>A bubbly, outgoing older sister, and a cool, reserved younger sister.</p>



<p>“So, is she your friend, Sumi-kun? She’s cute,” Aria-san asked, completely taking control of the situation.</p>



<p>Caught off guard by Aria-san’s attention, Sayu instinctively grabbed the hem of my shirt with her fingers.</p>



<p>“She’s also Yorka’s friend,” I replied on her behalf.</p>



<p>“Oh, how surprising. Would you mind introducing me?” Aria-san seemed genuinely taken aback.</p>



<p>I was surprised too.</p>



<p>Aria-san’s knack for teaching was because of her keen observational skills. She could grasp someone’s true feelings from the slightest hints and guide the conversation in her intended direction.</p>



<p>Even back when she used to tutor me, she could easily see through my fatigue or lack of motivation and push me to get back on track. Had her razor-sharp insight dulled since then, or was Yorka just an exception?</p>



<p>“Can’t you just introduce yourself?”</p>



<p>Despite knowing it was just a waste of time to argue, I didn’t want to simply succumb to the Dreadful Demon Queen.</p>



<p>“These things require proper procedure. Guys who skip the process get dumped pretty quickly. See?”</p>



<p>Somehow, her advice sounded oddly convincing. But it irked me a bit to hear that from Aria-san, who always skipped the process more than anyone else.</p>



<p>“Um, Ki-senpai. Is this super beautiful lady, who’s on par with Yor-senpai possibly be…”</p>



<p>Unable to contain her curiosity any longer, Sayu timidly interrupted us with her question.</p>



<p>“Oh, right. This is Yorka’s older sister. Aria-san, this is Yukinami Sayu. She’s a first-year.” I introduced them to each other.</p>



<p>“Yor-senpai’s… older sister!?”</p>



<p>“Yes, I’m Yor-chan’s older sister! Thank you for getting along with my little sis!” </p>



<p>Aria-san responded cheerfully and energetically. Sayu’s surprise at the differences despite their resemblance was evident.</p>



<p>“What’s with that glowing face? Your beauty is blinding! Are you the reincarnation of Princess Kaguya!?”</p>



<p>Princess Kaguya? Oh, right, because she was as radiant as the bamboo.</p>



<p>“Sayu, calm down.”</p>



<p>“Why are you so indifferent, Ki-senpai!?”</p>



<p>“She just looks like someone cosplaying as a beautiful girl to me,” I let out my cold, honest opinion based on past experiences.</p>



<p>“What? Has dating Yor-senpai finally broken your brain?” </p>



<p>She hit me with a sudden, biting remark.</p>



<p>“That’s harsh. She’s the Dreadful Demon Queen before she’s Yorka’s sister.”</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai, if you use Yor-senpai as your benchmark, you’ll end up with a miserable life where no one can satisfy you. High school will be the peak and the end of your life.”</p>



<p>“That’s quite a lecture.”</p>



<p>Though Yorka had been silent, Aria-san ignored her and chimed in, “Hey hey, Sumi-kun, you seem pretty close with her.”</p>



<p>“We’ve known each other since middle school. We live in the same neighborhood and we used to join the same club.”</p>



<p>“Oh, really? Could it be that she has had a crush on you since then? And recently confessed but got turned down, and now things are back to normal? I kinda smell a lingering romance.”</p>



<p>Aria-san’s words might have sounded casual, but Sayu’s expression froze at the unexpected direct hit.</p>



<p>Correction: Aria-san’s observational skills were as sharp as ever.</p>



<p>From our brief exchange, Aria-san deduced it all. Sayu had harbored feelings for me for a while and confessed not long ago. But thanks to Yorka, we were able to revert to our senpai-kouhai relationship. Now, she often hung out with my friends as part of our group.</p>



<p>Beside the pale Sayu, I let out a deep sigh.</p>



<p>─Aria-san wouldn’t be fooled by lies or evasion.</p>



<p>“Yor-senpai’s sister is way too sharp. Both of them are practically espers. And the big sister’s even more ruthless.”</p>



<p>Sayu tugged at my shirt sleeve, expressing her fear.</p>



<p><em>Hey, don’t pull too hard. You’ll tear the sleeve.</em></p>



<p>“It’s kinda comforting to see more people recognize her scariness,” I said with a dry laugh, “So, Aria-san, aren’t you supposed to be meeting with Kanzaki-sensei?”</p>



<p>Sensing that this conversation was going nowhere, I decided to wrap it up. Yorka had been silent the whole time.</p>



<p>“Oh, right. Let’s go together then, Sumi-kun,” Aria-san took my arm as if it was natural.</p>



<p>“Why though? I have nothing to do with this.”</p>



<p>“I asked for your help before, remember? Your assistance is crucial now. It’s time to repay the favor.”</p>



<p>“I don’t recall that. I have to study for the exams.”</p>



<p>“I can help you with that later. Sorry, but this time, I have to borrow you, Sumi-kun.” Ignoring my protests, Aria-san dragged me away.</p>



<p>“Don’t take Kisumi away without permission, Onēchan,” My girlfriend finally spoke up.</p>



<p>“This is a matter that will shape Yor-chan’s future. I won’t listen to your opinion today.”</p>



<p>“Then, all the more reason to tell me.”</p>



<p>Aria-san hesitated before speaking;</p>



<p>“Shizuru-chan is having an arranged marriage. If it goes through, she’ll quit teaching.”</p>



<p>“””Arranged marriage!?”””</p>



<p>All three of us, me, Sayu, and even Yorka, were shocked.</p>



<p>“See? It’s a big problem. That’s why Sumi-kun is indispensable to prevent it,” Aria-san’s gaze was serious.</p>



<p>“What role do you expect me to play?” I sensed trouble if I delved further.</p>



<p>Aria-san’s experience as my former tutor warned me of this danger signal. However, she added the final blow, as though she could see through my reluctance.</p>



<p>“Who would be most troubled if the homeroom teacher changed? You get it, don’t you?”</p>



<p>Aria-san’s vulnerable tone subtly guided me to understand her intentions.</p>



<p>“…..”</p>



<p>She hadn’t changed a bit.</p>



<p>She presented a difficult problem out of nowhere and forced me to solve it before moving forward. It might seem absurd, but there was always a purpose behind it. By stripping away my right to refuse, she allowed me to choose of my own volition.</p>



<p>The meaning behind Aria-san’s words was clear──it was all for the sake of her sister, Yorka.</p>



<p>“Onēchan, I’m going too!”</p>



<p>“Nope. Yor-chan, you go home.”</p>



<p>“Why?”</p>



<p>“Because our talk will go smoother without you.”</p>



<p>Just to make things go smoother. That was the reason Aria-san needed to leave Yorka behind.</p>



<p>“I won’t be a bother, I promise.”</p>



<p>“There’s no point in having you there.”</p>



<p>“B-but I’m worried about Kisumi!”</p>



<p>“If that’s your sole reason, I won’t allow you even more.” Aria-san paid no heed, dismissing everything Yorka said.</p>



<p>“But—”</p>



<p>“Yor-chan, don’t be selfish and listen to your big sis.”</p>



<p>Like a magic spell, Yorka was unable to utter another word.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>“Thanks for catching on to my intentions so quickly.”</p>



<p>“That was a bit too forceful, don’t you think? Yorka was really thrown off, couldn’t you have been a bit gentler?”</p>



<p>“But Sumi-kun, you managed to convince her nicely at the end, saying you were just coming to inquire as the class rep.”</p>



<p>Aria-san praised my quick thinking like it was applause-worthy.</p>



<p>We walked through the school halls toward the faculty room.</p>



<p>“It’s tough for me to do that as her boyfriend…”</p>



<p>“But you’re coming because you thought this is necessary, right?” She peered into my eyes.</p>



<p>“It’s for Yorka’s sake.”</p>



<p>Now that I knew about it, I couldn’t just ignore it.</p>



<p>If Kanzaki-sensei got married and left her teaching job, we’d have a new homeroom teacher. </p>



<p>Despite Yorka seeing her as her arch-nemesis, Kanzaki-sensei was an excellent teacher who was understanding and caring towards her students. Even if Yorka herself wouldn’t admit it, we had been quite helped by her.</p>



<p>Back in April when rumors circulated about Yorka coming home in the morning, it was thanks to the cooperation between Kanzaki-sensei and Aria-san that we were able to enjoy our high school life peacefully. No matter how much help I provided as a boyfriend and class rep, there were limits to what students could do.</p>



<p>Of course, if Kanzaki-sensei were to marry of her own accord, I’d offer my blessings. And even if she decided to resign from teaching as a result, I’d bid her a warm farewell. But with Aria-san actively trying to interfere, there must be some special circumstances behind it.</p>



<p>“Yeah. We always act in Yor-chan’s best interest.”</p>



<p>“Even if your sister opposes it?”</p>



<p>“Life sometimes presents us with tough choices.”</p>



<p>“Is disrupting your former homeroom teacher’s arranged marriage more important than to keep your cute sister happy?”</p>



<p>As a mysterious beauty walked down the corridor, passing students inevitably turned to look. Even guest slippers looked like fashionable items in her presence. Her charisma was truly something else.</p>



<p>While Yorka would likely make a displeased face, Aria-san paid no mind to others’ gazes. She was striding with the grace of a fashion show runway model.</p>



<p>“The desperate moments are usually accompanied by pain.”</p>



<p>“You sound convincing.”</p>



<p>“Hmm. The old Sumi-kun would’ve believed me without hesitation.”</p>



<p>“But why do you need me in the first place?”</p>



<p>“Because you’re my trump card.”</p>



<p>I was completely lost. If they were planning to crash the arranged marriage, wouldn’t it be more effective to bring along a strong guy like Nanamura?</p>



<p>“We’ll talk about it after meeting with Shizuru-chan.”</p>



<p>“What kind of crazy request am I for this time?” I sighed, dreading what was to come.</p>



<p>“But you came, didn’t you?”</p>



<p>Aria strode confidently through her alma mater, while I followed like a henchman.</p>



<p>“This is to protect our happy high school life as a couple.” I emphasized my position. I had learned the hard way that if I didn’t speak up to Aria-san, I’d inevitably be swept along by her pace.</p>



<p>Yorka must have been tossed around like this since she was little. She might think she was happy, but it was more like indoctrination. She had been ingrained with the idea that always following her sister and behaving like her was the only right answer.</p>



<p>If Yorka had rebelled against her exceptionally talented sister during puberty, she would’ve probably chosen a different path. But for better or worse, she still wholeheartedly liked Aria-san. Sometimes, excessive admiration could become shackles.</p>



<p>The sad expression on Yorka’s face when Aria-san left her behind earlier resembled that of a little girl.</p>



<p>“Were you drawn to Yor-chan because you sensed my presence in her?”</p>



<p>“That’s ridiculous.” I brushed off Aria-san’s playful words.</p>



<p>“Whoa, no need to shut me down so quickly. You have zero interest, huh? That’s a first for me.”</p>



<p>Unconcerned about onlookers, this beauty laughed out loud.</p>



<p>“Is it that amusing?”</p>



<p>“I wonder where the loyal Sumi-kun has gone. It’s quite sad.”</p>



<p>“I appreciate it, but I’m not exactly a devout follower of the Demon Queen.”</p>



<p>“Hehe. I actually quite like that cheeky side of yours.”</p>



<p>“Well, thank you.”</p>



<p>Aria-san hummed a tune as she climbed the stairs.</p>



<p>“Oh, by the way, how do I look? Does this outfit suit me?”</p>



<p>“Anybody can look good with the right clothes.”</p>



<p>“What? Take a good look and give me a proper compliment!”</p>



<p>Despite being in the middle of the staircase, she tried to show off her glamorous outfit and twirled around. Predictably, she lost her balance and nearly tumbled down.</p>



<p>I instinctively reached out and supported Aria-san’s back.</p>



<p>“Be careful on the stairs, especially in slippers. Don’t get too carried away.”</p>



<p>“I knew Sumi-kun would catch me,” Aria-san smiled.</p>



<p>“Should I let go immediately?”</p>



<p>“I’m just excited to be back at my old school. So, what do you think about my outfit?”</p>



<p>Anyone who disparaged Arisaka Aria’s appearance was clearly envious or bitter. Or they simply lacked refined taste.</p>



<p>“It’s quite the transformation, almost like a disguise. The difference between before and after is striking, but I guess that’s to be expected from Yorka’s sister. You’re quite attractive when you put in the effort.”</p>



<p>“Thank you.”</p>



<p>Aria-san then casually wrapped her arm around mine, using it as a makeshift handrail.</p>



<p>“You’re too close! Don’t suddenly get all touchy like back then!”</p>



<p>“Why not? I like the laid-back, manga-like vibe. The combination of hard work, friendship, and victory, where you successfully passed the exams and made it into the chosen school!”</p>



<p>“More like a Sparta-style regime of control, manipulation, and coercion. Even if you look beautiful on the outside, I’m expecting you to be the same on the inside.”</p>



<p>Even though I tried to appear calm, I was feeling a bit nervous too. As a guy, when you had such beauty right in front of you, it was bound to make your heart flutter.</p>



<p>This was no good. Being sisters, they shared similar features that naturally appealed to me, causing my heart to race automatically.</p>



<p>“You managed to concentrate on your studies without being swayed by my charm.”</p>



<p>“Where exactly was this charm back then?”</p>



<p>“And what about now?”</p>



<p>“…You were just hiding your natural beauty.”</p>



<p>I felt like I was losing my composure.</p>



<p>On the inside, she was the same carefree older sister as before. However, her appearance now was like the perfect version of Yorka with a touch of maturity.</p>



<p>“Hahh… It’s like reverse fraud. Sometimes the real deal doesn’t quite match the photo.”</p>



<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>



<p>“Yorka once showed me her family photo. If only I’d known back then…”</p>



<p>During the inter-class ball competition in April, Yorka had bolted from the classroom after we decided on the events. When we talked on the staircase landing, I saw the Arisaka family photo. The impression I had at that time was that the older sister resembled Yorka, but I never imagined she was the same uninspiring cram school tutor.</p>



<p>The disparity between appearance and substance still troubled me, creating a sense of distance.</p>



<p>“So, you didn’t catch on. That’s so like you, Sumi-kun.”</p>



<p>“Well, the photo doesn’t capture the disappointment on the inside.”</p>



<p>“What was that?”</p>



<p>As I untied Aria-san’s grip on my arm, she looked disgruntled.</p>



<p>When we reached the faculty room, Aria-san garnered immense popularity like a walking billboard. As a star graduate, she was welcomed back to her alma mater with open arms. The veteran teachers especially looked particularly thrilled, and a circle formed around her in no time.</p>



<p>Even the usually stern headteacher couldn’t help but soften in Aria-san’s presence. Although everyone had their tales of struggle with her, now they recounted their experiences with a hint of fondness. </p>



<p>Aria-san, for her part, still remembered the names of all the teachers who had gathered around her, a testament to her formidable memory. </p>



<p>With the presence of the graduate-turned-star dominating the staff room, I felt like a mere background character.</p>



<p>Was this innate star quality? I wondered while quietly admired her from the sidelines.</p>



<p>Aria-san requested to see Kanzaki-sensei, and as we waited, the conversation with the teachers suddenly turned to Yorka.</p>



<p>“Isn’t your sister in her second year now? I remember when she declined to be the freshman representative at the entrance ceremony, but now I see the little sister’s a bit lacking.”</p>



<p>A middle-aged teacher jokingly touched on the differences between the Arisaka sisters.</p>



<p>“My sister is more serious and responsible than me,” Aria-san responded with a calm expression.</p>



<p>“Because Arisaka always stood out and made a scene, I thought her sister would do something bold too.”</p>



<p>The teacher’s offhand comment carried a sense of innocence, but it felt incredibly insensitive to me. It was the underlying tone when someone spoke without realizing the implications.</p>



<p>In other words, this teacher expected Yorka to bring the same liveliness as Aria-san.</p>



<p>Aria-san became the student council president from her first year, expanded the scale of school events, and increased the number of applicants by modeling for the school brochure.</p>



<p>Even though they were sisters, expecting Yorka to live up to Aria-san’s standards was unreasonable. With each passing moment, I grew increasingly irritated by the remark.</p>



<p>Before I could speak up, Aria-san expressed her sentiments for me.</p>



<p>“What are you saying? Just because we’re sisters doesn’t mean we’re the same person. Please don’t have weird expectations for my sister. If she were anything like me, the teachers would have a hard time. If you keep making arbitrary comments, I’ll file a complaint as her proxy guardian.”</p>



<p>Her words were soft and charming, but her voice held clear dissatisfaction. Her eyes weren’t smiling.</p>



<p>“I see, my apologies. Haha…”</p>



<p>The middle-aged teacher hastily retracted his words.</p>



<p>“And that’s because Shizuru—I mean Kanzaki-sensei did a great job guiding me.”</p>



<p>There was a palpable sense of trust in Aria-san’s voice.</p>



<p>Hmm, every time I encountered moments like this, I realized not every homeroom teacher was the same. In turn, I was once again struck by Kanzaki-sensei’s brilliance.</p>



<p>Like on a cue, Kanzaki-sensei appeared in the faculty room after hearing Aria-san was here. My homeroom teacher quickly noticed my presence.</p>



<p>“Why is Sena-san here too?”</p>



<p>“To be honest, I’m not entirely sure myself. I was dragged back because Sensei is having an arranged marriage,” I explained in a hushed tone. </p>



<p>For a moment, a fierce expression flashed across Kanzaki-sensei’s usual stoic face.</p>



<p>Kanzaki-sensei promptly dispersed the group of veteran teachers who were chatting and guided me and Aria-san to the tea room.</p>



<p>As we walked behind Kanzaki-sensei, I discreetly spoke to Aria-san. “You were genuinely angry just now, weren’t you?”</p>



<p>“If you want to graduate peacefully, it’s best not to antagonize the teachers.”</p>



<p>“Coming from the least convincing person…”</p>



<p>“But, Sumi-kun, you’re still reliable.”</p>



<p>Aria-san casually rested her hand on my shoulder.</p>
