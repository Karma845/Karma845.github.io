<h1>Chapter 4: Ex-Girlfriend, Childhood Friend, and Stepsister</h1>


<p>“I think it is important for married couples to have a relationship in which they think ‘I feel most at home when I’m with you.’ “</p>

<p>In Nasu, a luxury resort area in Tochigi Prefecture.</p>
<p>About 15 minutes by limousine from Nasu Interchange, at the entrance of a log house, Juujo-san said so.</p>

<p>“I can understand that. For me too, I feel the most at ease when I’m with Shinichi or looking at Shinichi.”</p>
<p>“The kanji used for ‘looking at (見)’ gives me an uneasy feeling… To feel calm while engaging in criminal behavior like stalking, Shinagawa-san, there’s something wrong with you.”</p>
<p>“Criminal behavior?”</p>

<p>To the accurate quit from Osaki Sumire, Sakiho Shinagawa responded and tilted her head.</p>

<p>“A long time has passed since you broke up, but why this clingy, hopeless ex-girlfriend came all the way here to pester him?”</p>
<p>“I’m not being clingy. I’m just here for my own purpose. Can you stop treating me as your enemy just because I’m the only one in the world who has dated Hirakawa-kun? Okay, Stalker-san?”</p>
<p>“So what if I’m a stalker? Thanks to that, there’s not a single thing I don’t know about Shinichi.”</p>
<p>“Oh really? Then tell me, do you know what Hirakawa-kun ate for lunch on his first-ever date? Oh, of course, that date was with me.”</p>
<p>“Ugh, such a cheap provocation. Naturally, knowing something like that is common sense.”</p>

<p>While saying it was a cheap provocation, Sakiho Shinagawa wholeheartedly played along.</p>

<p>“By the way, which one does Osaki Sumire count as his first-ever date in life? If it’s about the school festival visit, it’s Tapioca Milk Tea from Class 1-3. If it’s about the first arcade date after you started dating, it’s a Cheeseburger Set with side menu of fries and drink is orange juice. How?”</p>

<p>As Osaki was bombarded with information, she was taken aback.</p>

<p>“T-That’s creepy…! How do you know everything…?”</p>
<p>“I don’t know everything, just about Shinichi.”</p>
<p>“Ugh… Hirakawa-kun, how can you interact normally with someone like her!?”</p>

<p>Osaki looked at me with an incredulous expression.</p>

<p>“But, Osaki Sumire, you acknowledged that both was the correct answer means you remember it, huh? Do you think both memories are important to you since you still remember it? Then, won’t you just admit that you’re a bit clingy?”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>Ah?</p>

<p>“It’s because I have a very good memory. I can’t forget things that happened once, no matter how trivial they may be. I guess being too smart is also troublesome.”</p>
<p>“Did you just say ‘Ah’?”</p>
<p>“What are you talking about?”</p>
<p>“It’s puzzling. How can you keep talking about such irrelevant things for so long?”</p>

<p>As the two of them bickered (or pretended to?), my stepsister Maion raised her retort in an exasperated manner.</p>

<p>“We’re still in the middle of Juujo-san’s story. I mean, she has only said a few words so far. Yet, it’s puzzling how you can go on and on about such pointless topics. It doesn’t matter at all what Onīchan’s first date meal was.”</p>
<p>“Sorry…”</p>

<p>Both of them apologized for the undeniable truth.</p>
<p>It’s rare to see Maion so displeased.</p>

<p>“…By the way, this is an utterly irrelevant matter, but the first meal Onīchan ever made for me was ginger pork. Though I guess neither of you has ever eaten his homemade dishes. Well, for Maion, who has been living with Onīchan almost like a couple and eating his homemade dishes almost every day, it doesn’t matter much.”</p>
<p>” “H-Homemade…!” “</p>

<p>They were intrigued by the mention of homemade dishes.</p>

<p>“Sigh… Juujo-san, please continue your story. I understand that being in a relationship where you feel most at ease when together is crucial for a married couple. Is that what you’re trying to prove with this lodge stay?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s what I’m thinking.”</p>

<p>Since the conversation didn’t seem to be going anywhere, I steered it back, but Juujo-san nodded nonchalantly as if not bothered by having been sidelined for a while.</p>

<p>“In the Disneyland date, we declared the winner based on which of them could stimulate Shinichi-sama’s happy hormones the most. This time, during your stay here at Nasu’s log house, we’ll declare the winner based on who can make Shinichi-sama relax the most.”</p>
<p>“Relax this time, huh?”</p>

<p>It seemed like the opposite of the previous Disneyland date’s criterion, but it certainly could be something essential for a marital relationship.</p>

<p>“From now until 10 p.m., we’ll measure how relaxed Shinichi-sama is using his smartwatch. When a person is in a relaxed state, their parasympathetic nervous system becomes more active, heart rate decreases, blood pressure drops, and blood flow improves. We will measure that time and intensity with the smartwatch. And…”</p>

<p>Juujo-san paused as if to emphasize the importance of this point.</p>

<p>“During the time Shinichi-sama is relaxed, additional points will be awarded to the person who is in Shinichi-sama’s field of vision at that moment and contributes to his relaxation.”</p>
<p>“Not the person closest to me, but the one in my field of vision?”</p>

<p>It seems the criteria for awarding points are slightly different from the Disneyland time.</p>

<p>“Yes. Since everyone is staying under one roof, the physical distance hardly changes.”</p>
<p>“How do you determine if someone is ‘in his field of vision’?”</p>

<p>This time, Maion raised her hand.</p>

<p>“According to the development team, it’s almost synonymous with ‘the person your brain is thinking of.’ “</p>
<p>“So, does that mean even when looking at photos or videos, it counts as being in his field of vision?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s right.”</p>

<p>‘I see’, Sakiho nodded and said so.</p>

<p>“In summary, the person who can make Shinichi feel the most relaxed, for the longest and deepest duration while he’s in front of him, wins?”</p>
<p>“Yes. On the other hand, if someone is present when he’s feeling nervous, excited, or anxious, they will lose points, so be careful.”</p>
<p>“Using seduction or confinement would be counterproductive then…”</p>

<p>Osaki muttered something scary. Last time, Ria tried to do both…</p>

<p>“And for the one who wins the showdown, we have prepared an additional date. “</p>
<p>“Oh right! That’s what I was curious about.”</p>

<p>Sakiho clapped her hands as if she had been waiting for this, then tilted her head, ‘Huh?’</p>

<p>“Even if it’s called an ‘additional date,’ the winner is determined at 10 p.m., right? So, does that mean they will just go to bed after that?”</p>
<p>“You’re absolutely right. By the way, this lodge is a bit small, it’s a 3LDK. I’ll be staying at a nearby hotel, but we’re one room short.”</p>
<p>“3LDK means there are three bedrooms? Shinichi, me, Maion… Three people fit perfectly, don’t they?”</p>
<p>“‘Three people fit perfectly’? You’re intentionally excluding me…”</p>
<p>Osaki subtly pointed out Sakiho’s attempt to eliminate her.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Maion sat beside them, counting on her fingers and organizing the current situation.</p>

<p>“Basically, there are three rooms. Onīchan, Sakiho-san, Sumire-san, and Maion make four people staying, so we are one room short. Hmm…could it be…?”</p>
<p>“Yes, that’s the idea.”</p>

<p>In response to Maion’s subtle question, Juujo-san nodded.</p>

<p>“The winner will stay in the same room as Shinichi-sama tonight.”</p>
<p>“Sharing a bed with Hirakawa-kun…!”</p>

<p>Once again, Osaki used such an old-fashioned word as [sharing a bed (同衾, dōkin)]… I quickly raised my hand in a panic.</p>

<p>“J-Juujo-san. Even if it’s the same room, it’s a twin room, right…?” (Two single beds.)</p>

<p>Even if it’s a twin room, the idea of being in the same room with someone is too stimulating for me, and I wanted to at least confirm.</p>

<p>“No, there’s only one bed in each room, and there are no extra sofas or futons.”</p>
<p>“Seriously…?”</p>
<p>“Seriously.”</p>
<p>“Hehehe, Shinichi’s arm pillow…”</p>
<p>“Hmm. Now that I think about it, Maion has never slept in the same bed as Onīchan.”</p>

<p>Sakiho drooled with a lustful look, and Maion slightly blushed while calculating something in her mind.</p>

<p>“I see, if only I can get him into the bath… No, but…”</p>

<p>Osaki muttered some ominous things in a serious tone.</p>

<p>“Hey, Osaki… Bath?”</p>
<p>“Ah.”</p>

<p>Ah?</p>

<p>“It’s just…I always bring my duck doll into the bath every day. Is that strange? It’s not strange, right?”</p>
<p>“Uh, well…”</p>

<p>Naturally, I had questions like, ‘At your age? With that character?’ in my mind, but I felt an overwhelming pressure that I shouldn’t further expand on this topic, so I closed my mouth for now.</p>

<p>“Alright, then we’re going to start now. I’ll visit you again in the evening.”</p>

<p> </p>


<p>Once again, I thought about what I should do during this villa date.</p>
<p>In fact, there are many aspects of this date that I can agree with.</p>

<p>In this study abroad, if I manage to find someone and become the president of Verite, I will still continue to strive for the top of the Hirakawa Group.</p>
<p>At that time, what I sought most in my family life is probably peace.</p>
<p>Having a relationship where we can stay together without getting divorced is also an important aspect of feeling at ease when we’re together, and it makes sense that I should not feel tension or stress with someone I’ll spend the longest time of my life with.</p>
<p>In this case, it seems to be a good idea not to think about outperforming them but to surrender to the relaxation value measured by my own body.</p>
<p>On the other hand, it also means that I need to protect myself from actions that deviate from the rules.</p>

<p>I once again looked at the three participants – Osaki Sumire, Sakiho Shinagawa, and Hirakawa Maion.</p>
<p>Hmm, all three of them seem like they’re up to something…</p>

<p>Thus, the four of us split up to explore the log house.</p>

<p>“It seems like the first floor has the kitchen, living room, and dining area, while the second floor has individual bedrooms,” said Maion.</p>
<p>“I checked the second floor, and there’s one double bed in each room, a small table, and just the bathroom and toilet. The bathroom is only in the bedrooms, but there’s a toilet on the first floor as well,” said Osaki.</p>
<p>“We have some dishes and cooking utensils in the kitchen, but the fridge is empty, so we’ll have to go buy something…” I said.</p>
<p>“I went around the house, and there was only one motorcycle by the building’s side. Looks like that’s how we’ll get around,” Sakiho said, returning from the frontdoor.</p>
<p>It’s like they’re organizing the situation and arranging the hints for reasoning.</p>
<p>I hope there won’t be a locked room murder or something here.</p>

<p>“Hirakawa-kun.”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Oh, what’s up?”</p>

<p>Osaki had somehow come to stand next to me and reached her hand toward my ear, causing me to reflexively avoid it.</p>
<p>At that moment, I smelled a gentle lavender-like scent.</p>

<p>“Don’t be so jumpy. There was a thread stuck in your hair, I just took it off.”</p>

<p>She showed me the thread that was stuck in my hair.</p>

<p>“…Perfume. You haven’t changed since back then.”</p>
<p>“Oh yes, you remembered.”</p>

<p>Osaki smiled lightly.</p>

<p>“I see, so you can’t forget the scent of your former lover, Hirakawa-kun. Do you have any lingering feelings?”</p>
<p>“No, that’s…”</p>

<p>Although I wanted to say something in response, I was internally unsettled by the fragrance that tickled my nose once again.</p>
<p>Back when we were dating, she used to wear this perfume.</p>
<p>I pointed out that it was unusual for a high school student and that I wasn’t familiar with the scent.</p>

<p>『This fragrance is almost the same as the one I use as a pillow mist. It helps me feel calm, so I wear it when I’m nervous or feel like I’m going to get carried away.』</p>
<p>『Nervous? Why?』</p>
<p>『That’s a mean question, Hirakawa-kun.』</p>

<p>And then she continued.</p>

<p>『Hanging out with someone you like can make anyone nervous and excited, right?』</p>

<p>I remembered Osaki’s shy smile from that day and shook my head.</p>

<p>“Shinichi?”</p>

<p>Sakiho cut in between Osaki and me.</p>

<p>“Shinichi, the minimalist, do you only have this backpack? I’ll take it to my room, okay? Isn’t it okay since I’m going to win?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah…?”</p>
<p>“Shinagawa-san, it’s not decided yet who will win…”</p>
<p>“Yeah-yeah, I know.”</p>

<p>Sakiho grabbed my arm, which was floating in the lavender scent, and whispered with a sulky expression.</p>

<p>“Geez, Shinichi, pull yourself together.”</p>

<p>As Osaki said, it’s still not known who will win, so for now, each of the three girls secured their rooms, and after the announcement of the results, it was decided that I would go to the room of the winning person.</p>
<p>After organizing my belongings, the living room clock indicated the time. It was 1 p.m.</p>

<p>“As Hirakawa-kun said earlier, we need to go shopping for dinner, but there’s no convenience store or supermarket within walking distance. The only means of transportation is the motorcycle. Does anyone here have a motorcycle license?”</p>

<p>Osaki tilted her head, and Sakiho wore a sly smile.</p>

<p>“Huh? You don’t know? Oh, right, Osaki Sumire is only his ‘middle school’ ‘ex’-girlfriend, so you wouldn’t know.”</p>
<p>“.:…What is it?”</p>
<p>“Well, I wonder?”</p>
<p>“Sigh… It’s fine; You don’t need to say it. I can understand from the context. Hirakawa-kun got his license when he turned 16.”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s right.”</p>

<p>I responded from the side since it was about me.</p>
<p>Having a driver’s license can be surprisingly useful for part-time jobs such as newspaper delivery and food delivery because having a license can increase efficiency and hourly wages.</p>
<p>When I was working at a fast-food restaurant that also offered delivery services, they mentioned that they would provide financial assistance for getting a license, so I decided to get one at that time.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Now then, let’s decide who the other person will be.”</p>
<p>“How about rock-paper-scissors?”</p>

<p>As Sakiho twisted her hand to form a fist and tried to peek into it, Osaki grabbed her wrist.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, Shinagawa-san.”</p>
<p>“What’s the matter?”</p>
<p>“How about you withdraw? In fact, it’s not a good idea to go with Hirakawa-kun.”</p>
<p>“Do you think I’d fall for such a lie? Being in Shinichi’s field of view for as long as possible is advantageous. The longer I’m with Shinichi, the better.”</p>

<p>Sakiho frowned, and Osaki shook her head with a sigh.</p>

<p>“It’s not a lie. Didn’t they say it’s better not to be together when you’re nervous? Think about it calmly. The person going shopping with him will be together before and after Hirakawa-kun drives the bike. Do you think someone can relax while driving a bike?”</p>
<p>“That…makes sense…? Hmm…?”</p>
<p>“It’s puzzling.”</p>

<p>As Sakiho was about to accept it but couldn’t completely agree, Maion beside her furrowed her brow.</p>

<p>“Like Sumire-san, Maion think it’s disadvantageous to go shopping with Onīchan. I don’t think you’ll feel relaxed during shopping, but why does Sumire-san give such advice? If both Sakiho-san and Maion withdraw, then Sumire-san will be the one to go. Do you want to go, Sumire-san?”</p>
<p>“That is…”</p>

<p>Osaki looked taken aback as she was pressed for an answer.</p>

<p>“That’s true! Osaki Sumire, why? I can’t help but think there’s something more to it.”</p>
<p>“There’s nothing behind it. I just feel that I am at a disadvantage compared to both of you…”</p>

<p>After a short pause for thought, she continued.</p>

<p>“B-because of both of you… Y-yes, Maion-san, who lived together with Hirakawa-kun, and Shinagawa-san, who’s his childhood friend. Normally, you two would be the ones who can make him relax. That’s why, even if it involves some risks, I thought I should increase the time I spend with Hirakawa-kun. That’s all.”</p>

<p>Osaki spoke unusually talkatively.</p>

<p>“…I see. I understand what Osaki Sumire is trying to say.”</p>
<p>“Shinagawa-san!”</p>

<p>In response to Sakiho’s words, Osaki’s eyes lit up with hope.</p>

<p>“Well then, how about rock-paper-scissors?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>However, the next moment, her eyes darkened with question marks.</p>

<p>“Um, Shinagawa-san? Were you listening…? So, all you have to do is decline…”</p>
<p>“You know, Osaki Sumire?”</p>

<p>Again, Sakiho had a look on her face that said, ‘Are you an idiot?”</p>

<p>“I just want to go on a shopping date with Shinichi while he recognizes me.”</p>
<p>“It’s as if you’re saying there’s a shopping date where Onīchan doesn’t recognize you…”</p>

<p>That’s usually what happens…</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>I finally arrived at the supermarket and she followed me, carrying a shopping basket.</p>

<p>“Onīchan, you’re walking a bit too fast.”</p>
<p>“Ah, sorry…”</p>

<p>In the end, Maion won the rock-paper-scissors.</p>
<p>Sakiho and Osaki tried to start a rock-paper-scissors game together, but Maion said, ‘Maion absolutely wants to win here,’ and then, using psychological warfare tactics like, ‘Maion will choose paper,’ she indeed chose paper and won on her own.</p>

<p>“Hey, wasn’t Maion supposed to not participate in rock-paper-scissors?”</p>
<p>“I never said anything like that. I just said that it’s disadvantageous to go with Onīchan.”</p>
<p>“You just said it’s disadvantageous to go with Onīchan…”</p>

<p>What’s the difference?</p>

<p>“Besides, do you think Maion wouldn be able to handle a situation where she’s alone under the same roof with either Sumire-san or Sakiho-san?”</p>
<p>“I guess the bride candidates are not getting along?”</p>
<p>“Of course we’re not on good terms, but that’s not the point. Maion can only be alone with Onīchan.”</p>

<p>Maion pouted.</p>

<p>“And also, Maion really wanted to have time alone with Onīchan without anyone else interrupting.”</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>

<p>Although she’s saying something quite significant, Maion still maintains her usual indifferent expression.</p>
<p>If I only take her words at face value, it seems like she likes me.</p>

<p>“It’s strange. Why is your face turning red? I don’t know what’s going on, but whatever it is, it will result in negative points, so don’t look at me like that.”</p>
<p>“I can’t tell if you likes me or hates me…”</p>
<p>“It’s not about liking or hating. Maion just wanted to have time alone with Onīchan without anyone else interrupting. Don’t make me say it again.”</p>
<p>“Got it…”</p>

<p>Well, whether we can actually have uninterrupted time is uncertain.</p>

<p>“So, what are we buying?”</p>
<p>“Ah…”</p>

<p>I took out two pieces of paper.</p>
<p>To ensure fairness, I decided that I would take both of their shopping lists and buy everything responsibly so that no unfairness arises.</p>

<p>If I leave it to Maion, there’s a possibility she won’t buy everything or remove items from the basket.</p>
<p>Osaki’s shopping list was written on a plain white piece of paper, but Sakiho’s list was…</p>

<p>“This is inexplicable. I don’t understand why she would give us something like this… “</p>

<p>Seeing it, Maion frowned.</p>
<p>The reason was that Sakiho’s list was written on the margin of her own selfie photo.</p>
<p>It seems like she’s using the principle mentioned in the conversation with Juujo-san that even in photos and videos, she will be within my field of view.</p>
<p>So instead of Maion, who went shopping with me, she wants to make sure she gets the points by keeping herself in my sight.</p>

<p>“Why does Sakiho carry around her own photo? Is she really into herself or something?”</p>
<p>“Well… It’s a picture of me and Sakiho in a recent two-shot.”</p>
<p>“Two-shot…? Where is Onīchan in this photo…? Wow.”</p>

<p>Maion, upon finding me in the photo, lets out a surprised voice, and it’s no wonder because me in the picture is really small in the background.</p>
<p>Even animals that won’t come close when taking photos at the zoo are still a bit closer.</p>

<p>“This is practically like voyeurism…”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah…”</p>

<p>I sigh and start walking again.</p>
<p>While we were walking together like this at the supermarket, I thought of something.</p>

<p>“It’s strange. While we were walking together like this at the supermarket…”</p>

<p>Maion says exactly what’s on my mind, and I chuckle a bit.</p>

<p>“Maion thought the same thing?”</p>
<p>“You thought the same thing too, Onīchan?”</p>
<p>“Yeah.”</p>

<p>And at the same time, Maion and I blush.</p>

<p>“It’s like we’re brother and sister.”</p>
<p>“It’s like a married couple.”</p>

<p>Huh?</p>
<p>As I express my surprise, Maion blushes and goes, ‘Ah…’</p>

<p>“Maion…”</p>
<p>“I don’t understand. Don’t you have any sense of delicacy, Onīchan?”</p>

<p>With a slightly moody expression that suits a teenage girl, Maion turns away her head.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“How about some sausages?”</p>

<p>As we walk a little further together, a saleswoman calls out to us.</p>

<p>“Sure, I’ll have some.”</p>
<p>“You’re really frugal, aren’t you? It’s not even on our shopping list.”</p>

<p>I hold out my hand eagerly, and she gives me a sausage skewered on a toothpick.</p>
<p>Maion, who has been raised in a well-to-do family since elementary school, looks at me with a look of dismay.</p>
<p>What’s wrong? If someone offers you free food, you should eat it.</p>

<p>I take the sausage from the saleswoman and put it in my mouth.</p>
<p>The firm texture and the hot juices that burst out from the inside are delicious.</p>

<p>“Mmm…!”</p>
<p>“Wow…!”</p>

<p>As I smile happily, the saleswoman lets out an exclamation of admiration.</p>

<p>“You seems to really enjoy it! It makes me happy to see you like it!”</p>

<p>The saleswoman is beaming.</p>

<p>“Somehow, you have a face that makes me want to cook for you!”</p>

<p>As I hear a slight noise like something falling in the distance, Maion stretches a little and whispers in my ear.</p>

<p>“This person somehow smells like a thieving-cat.” (homewrecker.)</p>
<p>“Would your girlfriend want some sausages too?”</p>
<p>“……. “</p>

<p>Maion remains silent, looking intently at the saleswoman, and hides behind me. Just like a cat.</p>
<p>It seems Maion’s habit of strongly disliking talking to strangers she doesn’t know has not changed yet.</p>

<p>“She’s a shy girlfriend, huh? Sticking close to her boyfriend?! How adorable!”</p>
<p>“Well, she’s not exactly my girlfriend…”</p>
<p>“Oh, my apologies! Is it your wife?”</p>

<p>As I attempt to correct her, the saleswoman only accelerates her misunderstanding.</p>
<p>Though it’s quite obvious from our age and attire that we’re not married, there’s no need to clear up the saleswoman’s confusion, so I just smile awkwardly and move away from there.</p>

<p>“I wish you two a long and happy life~!”</p>

<div><img src="https://animestuff.me/img/0010_m9.png" alt="" /></div>

<p>The saleswoman is so cheerful it’s a bit worrisome. We didn’t even buy any sausages.</p>

<p>“She was quite something, huh…”</p>

<p>As I say this while looking at Maion, she nods and says, ‘Yes, well, I guess so,’ with a slight smile at the corner of her mouth.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong, Maion?”</p>
<p>“I heard we don’t really look like siblings?”</p>
<p>“Well, yeah, I guess not.”</p>

<p>Of course, it’s because we don’t look alike, we’re not even blood-related.</p>

<p>“She was an interesting thieving-cat.”</p>

<p>Maion smiles, which is unusual for her.</p>
<p>After finishing shopping and stepping outside, Maion suddenly hugs me from behind.</p>

<p>“Maion…?”</p>
<p>“Maion has been waiting for this moment. Onii-chan,”</p>

<p>I feel her trying to lean against me.</p>
<p>And a whisper with a soft voice tickles my ear.</p>
<p>“There’s something I’ve been wanting to talk to you about, just the two of us.”</p>
<p>“Now?”</p>
<p>“Yes. Before we go home, just the two of us.”</p>

<p>We’ve been alone together before.</p>
<p>But perhaps what Maion is seeking is a truly private moment, not just being alone in a public place like the store.</p>
<p>If that’s the case…</p>

<p>“I don’t think we’re alone right now.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>I convey my additional request to the puzzled Maion.</p>

<p>“Maion, just stay like this, hug me.”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>

<p>With a slightly displeased expression at my strange request, Maion timidly reaches her right hand toward my left chest.</p>

<p>“Your heart rate is rising. Are you nervous…? It’s incomprehensible, are you trying to give me negative points? It’s futile since I’m hugging you from behind and you can’t see my face.”</p>

<p>As she finishes checking my heartbeat, she tries to withdraw her hand, but I grab her wrist and keep it there.</p>

<p>“No, that’s not it. Just stay like this. I’m going to summon it now.”</p>
<p>“Summon? What on earth…?”</p>

<p>I took out the familiar note—Sakiho’s photo—from my pocket and brought it into view.</p>
<p>At the same time…</p>

<p>“Shinichi, not now!”</p>

<p>Sakiho Shinagawa suddenly jumped out from a little distance away.</p>

<p>“Geez, Shinichi, you’re so mean! If you do something like that, you’ll give me negative points! Not cool, okay?”</p>

<p>Sitting on a bench outside the store, Sakiho looked up at me, not showing any remorse but rather scolding me.</p>

<p>“By the way, when did you realize I was here?”</p>
<p>“I had a hunch even before coming here. Wasn’t it tough to ride a bicycle all the way here?”</p>
<p>“It was an electric bicycle, so, well… Wait, you knew that much!?”</p>
<p>“Wait a moment, this is confusing. Maion doesn’t know what’s going on…”</p>

<p>Maion, looking unusually bewildered, frowned, so I explained:</p>

<p>“There was not only a motorcycle but also a bicycle at the log house. Sakiho hid the fact and followed us on that bicycle after Maion, and I went to the supermarket. She was tailing us the whole time.”</p>
<p>“Ehh, is that the case…?”</p>
<p>“What… Did you find the bicycle, Shinichi? It was in a blind spot from the entrance, so we didn’t notice it when we first arrived… That’s not fair, you should have told me.”</p>
<p>“No, I didn’t see it. By the way, what do you even mean, ‘That’s not fair’?”</p>

<p>Ignoring my retort, Sakiho widened her eyes.</p>

<p>“You didn’t see it? Then why…?”</p>
<p>“When Sakiho checked the log house with everyone, she said, ‘There’s only one motorcycle.’ That phrasing felt odd to me.”</p>
<p>“Is there something strange?”</p>

<p>Maion tilted her head.</p>

<p>“Normally, if you find a motorcycle in a place where you didn’t expect anything, you’d say, ‘There’s a motorcycle.’ The phrasing, ‘There’s only one motorcycle,’ emphasizes that there was nothing else. So, I thought there might be other vehicles. And since Sakiho doesn’t have a driver’s license, if she wanted to keep it a secret, the only option would be a bicycle.”</p>
<p>“I see. Sakiho-san tried to follow Maion and Onīchan with her bicycle, I understand up to that point, but…”</p>

<p>However, Maion’s furrowed brows have not yet disappeared.</p>

<p>“But I don’t understand. Why would you do something like that? There shouldn’t be any benefits to following us, and if you don’t plan to reveal yourself, there won’t be any changes in points…”</p>
<p>“Yeah, that’s true…”</p>

<p>Maion’s point is valid.</p>
<p>In this competition, there is no merit in following closely as it wouldn’t add any points.</p>
<p>I can’t understand the reason behind Sakiho’s actions either.</p>

<p>“Why is that, Sakiho-san?”</p>
<p>“That’s just common sense?”</p>

<p>However, Sakiho says it with a face that seems to say, ‘I don’t understand the meaning of your question.’</p>

<p>“Because he, Shinichi, is there.”</p>
<p>“Is Sakiho-san’s stalker motivation the same as that of a mountain climber…?”</p>

<p>…It’s really a part of her that I can’t understand.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>We waited for Sakiho with her bicycle by repeatedly stopping, and the three of us finally returned to the log house together.</p>

<p>“Welcome back, Hirakawa-kun.”</p>

<p>At the entrance, Osaki was waiting with an oddly gentle expression.</p>

<p>“You were quite late, huh? I’ve been waiting this whole time. I just brewed some herbal tea with relaxing effects, Hirakawa-kun. Want some?”</p>
<p>“Wait a moment, Osaki Sumire. That’s unfair.”</p>
<p>“Shinagawa-san, I wonder which person should say something like that?”</p>
<p>“Sumire-san, why are you answering while smiling…?”</p>

<p>As Maion pointed out, Osaki had a smile on her face.</p>
<p>Her words and expression don’t match.</p>
<p>Perhaps she’s being considerate, thinking I’d get nervous if she showed an angry face. But thinking about what’s boiling over inside that smile is somehow scarier.</p>

<p>“Now, take a seat at the table. Hirakawa-kun, you sit here.”</p>
<p>“Understood.”</p>

<p>I was guided to the front seat of Osaki.</p>
<p>She probably did it so I could have her in my line of sight while drinking herbal tea.</p>
<p>Considering Sakiho’s trickery, it would not be too much of a burden for me to comply with her request.</p>
<p>Osaki poured herbal tea into four cups from the teapot and handed them to us. It seems she prepared not only for me but also for Sakiho and Maion.</p>
<p>Then, Sakiho raised her hand.</p>

<p>“Wait a moment, Osaki Sumire. Isn’t there some sleeping drug or poison in this?”</p>
<p>“That’s not possible. It’s poured from the same teapot.”</p>

<p>Osaki took a sip from her cup and showed it to us.</p>

<p>“See, there’s nothing wrong. And if you don’t want to drink it, that’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Are you sure? But there’s a possibility that it’s only smeared at the bottom of Shinichi’s cup… Come on, drink Shinichi’s.”</p>
<p>“Alright… How about this?”</p>

<p>As instructed, Osaki took a sip and showed the cup to Sakiho with a dumbfounded look.</p>

<p>“Not good yet. It might be smeared only in one spot on the rim, while the rest is covered. Lick all around the rim.”</p>
<p>“You’re so suspicious…”</p>

<p>Then, Osaki used her bewitching tongue and licked around the rim in one smooth motion.</p>

<p>“…did you fell for it?”</p>

<p>At that moment, Sakiho put on a mischievous grin.</p>

<p>“What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Come on, Shinichi? That’s the cup Osaki Sumire had her lips on.”</p>
<p>“You…!”</p>

<p>Yes, as Osaki knew, using seduction in this showdown was a no-go.</p>
<p>While she didn’t intend it as a seduction, it had a strong impact on me, a boy from an all-boys school.</p>

<p>“H-Hirakawa-kun, you don’t really care about that stuff, right?”</p>
<p>“Ah, yeah. Of course, I don’t care at all.”</p>

<p>And here, Shinichi Hirakawa’s bad habit as a virgin kicks in.</p>
<p>He’s the type who acts like he doesn’t care even though he does. He knows it himself——</p>

<p>“T-Then, please have a drink. Come on.”</p>
<p>“Yeah, thank you…it’s hot!?”</p>
<p>“I-I’m sorry!”</p>

<p>Surprisingly, Osaki slipped and spilled the herbal tea on my thigh.</p>
<p>Even Sakiho, who was provoking, didn’t expect it to turn out like this and looked at me with a sorry look on her face.</p>

<p>Maion had a similar expression on her face.</p>
<p>With the hot temperature, I finally remembered.</p>
<p>This girl, who looked perfect in appearance and intellect, was actually quite clumsy.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, it’s evident in her actions and words.</p>

<p>Afterward, she continued to demonstrate her clumsiness as a high-class young lady.</p>
<p>Having wet my pants, I borrowed Osaki’s room and changed into the pants I brought for pajamas (to avoid being locked up by Osaki, Sakiho and Maion accompanied me).</p>

<p>When I came out of the changing room, a burnt smell hit my nose.</p>

<p>“Hirakawa-kun, how about this? Incense is said to have a relaxing effect.”</p>
<p>“It’s a quite nice incense… wait, Osaki, fire!”</p>

<p>To my surprise, the bedside table where the incense was burning had scorched a bit.</p>
<p>I was shocked and horrified, probably minus points for her.</p>

<p>After dealing with the minor fire incident, Osaki took out a yoga mat.</p>

<p>“Through yoga and stretching, the relaxing effect will increase… um, Hirakawa-kun, you’re completely off, lower your hips and spread your legs wider.”</p>
<p>“It hurts, it hurts, it hurts, it hurts!”</p>

<p>In the throes of agony, she accumulated even more minus points.</p>
<p>After repeating such things a few times, Sakiho and Maion seemed to have judged something.</p>

<p>“It might be better to let Osaki Sumire do this… she’s the one at a disadvantage.”</p>
<p>“True…”</p>

<p>They seemed to have concluded, and they let her do as she pleased under their watchful eyes.</p>

<p>“Sigh… Hirakawa-kun, please, let me give you a massage.”</p>

<p>Osaki, who had been failing repeatedly, seemed to be quite cornered and finally resorted to using words like ‘please’ to me, which didn’t suit her at all.</p>
<p>It appeared that this was her final move.</p>

<p>“Could you lie face down on the bed?”</p>

<p>Feeling a little sorry for Osaki, I obediently complied, although I turned my head sideways to avoid feeling suffocated with my face buried in the pillow.</p>

<p>“I really like your face, Shinichi…”</p>

<p>Sakiho gazed at me with a blissful expression as she rested her chin on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>When I turned my head to the other side, Maion, with her small-animal-like serious expression, said, ‘Hmm, I see…’ while observing me.</p>

<p>“Hey, Osaki…”</p>
<p>“…Don’t say it, I know.”</p>

<p>In other words, while Osaki was massaging my back, I couldn’t see her face, so the relaxation points generated by this massage would be claimed by the two girls standing beside me.</p>

<p>But this wasn’t acceptable.</p>
<p>As someone who wanted to know the relaxation value I could get from each of them fairly, this situation was not welcomed.</p>

<p>“Hirakawa-kun?”</p>

<p>So, I buried my face into the pillow.</p>

<p>“Like this, I would see no one.”</p>
<p>“Hirakawa-kun…!”</p>

<p>As I mumbled, the hands massaging me added a gentle strength.</p>
<p>Although I couldn’t see her even if she massaged me, she was oddly conscientious about the massage.</p>
<p>I felt so comfortable that I started dozing off and eventually fell asleep.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>“Onīchan, Onīchan, Onīchan, Onīchan, Onīchan, Onīchan…”</p>

<p>When I woke up, I found Maion sitting astride on top of me.</p>

<p>“Why are you here calling my name?”</p>
<p>“Since ancient times, it’s a little sister’s duty to wake up her Onīchan like this.”</p>
<p>“But you’ve never done anything like this back home?”</p>
<p>“…It was just a little joke.”</p>

<p>It’s hard to tell when she says it with a straight face…</p>

<p>“Okay, why were you calling me?”</p>
<p>“It’s a subliminal effect. I thought, ‘I want to appear in my Onīchan’s dream.’ “</p>
<p>“I see…”</p>

<p>As she gave a vague answer, I heard the sound of someone approaching.</p>

<p>“Hey, Maion-chan! You’re sneaking ahead again!”</p>
<p>“Yes, Maion-san. It’s not fair that you keep doing things like that without helping much with the cooking.”</p>
<p>“It’s inexplicable. Maion only fulfilled her traditional role as a little sister to wake up her Onīchan.”</p>
<p>“You never did that when you were at home, did you?”</p>

<p>‘Sakiho knows everything’, I couldn’t say that anymore; it’s getting scary.</p>
<p>Dinner was curry. The three of them apparently made it together (or so they claim). Sorry for just sleeping…</p>

<p>“Let’s eat.”</p>

<p>I said as I held the spoon, but then Sakiho, who was sitting next to me, tapped my shoulder.</p>
<p>“Hey, Shinichi?”</p>

<p>When I turned to look, Sakiho was offering me a spoon with curry on it.</p>

<p>“Ahh~♪”</p>
<p>“Ah? Why? I can eat on my own…”</p>
<p>“Come on, Shinichi, you’re such a slow-witted childhood friend. Just eat it like this. While you’re eating, you can look at me. You can relax a lot, okay?”</p>
<p>“Wait a minute, Shinagawa-san.”</p>

<p>Osaki stood up with a clatter.</p>

<p>“If that’s the case, it’s not fair that each of us doesn’t get the same chance.”</p>
<p>“Sumire-san’s argument does have some merit as a spur-of-the-moment idea to make Shinichi choose her. I also want to give it a try.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t just a spur-of-the-moment idea… but oh well. Anyway, Hirakawa-kun, please eat from my spoon too.”</p>

<p>Saying that, the other two also offered their spoons.</p>
<p>Suddenly, Sakiho had a sly smile on her face.</p>

<p>“Alright then, let’s be fair and have him eat from each of your spoons. While munching, keep your partner in your line of sight. Let’s fairly measure which spoon brings the most relaxation. Okay, Shinichi?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, sure…”</p>

<p>Well, there’s a possibility of feeling tense and losing points, but that’s part of being fair.</p>

<p>“Hirakawa-kun, ahh—”</p>
<p>“Onīchan, here you go.”</p>
<p>“Now, Shinichi, ahh~♪”</p>

<p>I received curry from each of their spoons.</p>
<p>And when I tasted Sakiho’s curry, the words ‘I see’ unconsciously escaped my mouth.</p>

<p>“It’s inexplicable. When you ate Sakiho-san’s curry, your expression was different… Sakiho-san, did you do something?”</p>
<p>“Hmm? Is it about this?”</p>

<p>Sakiho took something out from under the table, on her lap.</p>

<p>“I just added a little bit of secret miso seasoning, only for my portion, you know?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t miso not appear on the shopping list?”</p>
<p>“I brought it myself. Because if I don’t hide it, it can’t be a secret ingredient, can it? “</p>
<p>“What’s with all this preparation?”</p>
<p>“It’s true Onīchan really liked miso…”</p>

<p>Interrupting my question, Maion nodded her head.</p>

<p>“Adding miso as a secret ingredient to curry is my mother’s original recipe.”</p>

<p>Sakiho smiled proudly as she said that.</p>

<p>“Both of you underestimated the information of a single stalker, huh?”</p>

<p>*****</p>

<p>At 10 p.m., Juujo-san arrived at the log house.</p>

<p>“How was the date?”</p>
<p>“Maion couldn’t leave much of an impression for Onīchan.”</p>
<p>“I also ended up making mistakes all the time, and I don’t think there was a moment where Maion-san scored any points. It’s unfortunate, but it seems like it’s Shinagawa-san’s victory.”</p>
<p>“It’s all for the sake of Shinichi’s love!”</p>

<p>Sakiho casually wrapped her arm around mine.</p>

<p>“I see, well then, I’ll announce the points now.”</p>

<p>One by one, Juujo-san read out the points.</p>

<p>“Hirakawa Maion-sama… minus 200 points.”</p>
<p>“Minus? Really?”</p>

<p>Maion seemed more surprised than disappointed as she looked at me.</p>

<p>“It’s puzzling. Were you nervous or excited about something, Onīchan?”</p>
<p>“…I don’t understand what you’re talking about.”</p>

<p>I couldn’t confess that I got excited by being embraced by my sister, even though it was just for appearances.</p>

<p>“Next, Sakiho Shinagawa-sama… 500 points.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, from my love’s perspective, that’s nothing, you know?”</p>

<p>With a triumphant smile, Sakiho moved closer to me.</p>

<p>“Well, I did everything I could. Can’t be helped.”</p>
<p>“And next, Osaki Sumire-sama…”</p>

<p>Osaki seemed to give up, her expression dimmed slightly, and Juujo-san announced the points.</p>

<p>“1800 points.”</p>
<p>“See, I told you Osaki Sumire is just an old-fashioned shy girl…wait, 1800 points?”</p>
<p>“Sumire-san, no way…”</p>

<p>Both of them showed expressions of shock.</p>

<p>“Wha…?”</p>

<p>Osaki displayed the most surprising reaction.</p>
<p>Then, Juujo-san declared the results once again.</p>

<p>“The winner is Osaki Sumire-sama.”</p>
<p>“Am I dreaming…?”</p>

<p>Well, I was the only one who had predicted that outcome.</p>
<p>Let me reveal the truth: I had a dream while taking a nap after Osaki’s massage.</p>

<p>In the dream, I was with Osaki.</p>
<p>The reason for the dream was simple: the same fragrance as Osaki’s perfume was also on her pillow.</p>
<p>It was probably because of her pillow mist.</p>

<p>That fragrance also had a calming effect, and even after waking up, I continued to sense Osaki’s scent.</p>
<p>If we define the ‘person in view’ as ‘the person floating in our mind,’ then it makes sense that the ‘person who appears in our dreams while sleeping’ also qualifies.</p>

<p>In other words, Osaki Sumire, who had been in my view during my most relaxed time, ‘my sleep’, emerged victorious.</p>
<p>It’s like a literal ‘dream’ come true.</p>

<p> </p>


<p>…And then, one hour later.</p>
<p>I was sitting on the bed, stiff in various ways.</p>
<p>This room was securely locked, ensuring no intrusion from the outside world, including Sakiho and Maion, until morning.</p>

<p>In return, it created a completely sealed room that couldn’t be opened from the inside either.</p>
<p>Just being in this unnaturally intimate room with Osaki was nerve-wracking, and I could hear the sound of water from the bathroom.</p>
<p>The sound of water being released from the shower mixed with occasional sounds, probably responding to Osaki’s movements, creating a vivid atmosphere.</p>

<p>With no sofa or other place to sit, I found myself sitting on the edge of the bed.</p>
<p>I felt reluctant to look toward the entrance where the bathroom was, so I focused on an abstract painting hanging on the opposite wall.</p>
<p>I couldn’t quite understand what was depicted, but some parts of the painting looked like the shape of a naked person… No, this was getting dangerous for me.</p>

<p>I thought of counting prime numbers to distract myself, but before I could do anything, suddenly, the bed sank, and at that next moment——</p>

<p>“Mmmph!?”</p>
<p>“Shh.”</p>

<p>A wet hand covered my mouth from behind.</p>
<p>As I slowly looked up, Osaki was hugging my head, and her wet hair dripped onto my cheeks.</p>
<p>It seemed she had wrapped herself in a bath towel and was kneeling on the bed.</p>
<p>Um, wait, did I feel a slight sensation on the back of my head… chest?</p>

<p>“Aren’t you thinking something impolite?”</p>

<p>I shook my head, stammering.</p>

<p>“Come with me to the bathroom just like this. If you make any noise, I’ll suffocate you right here.”</p>

<p>She whispered in my ear, and I raised both hands in surrender.</p>
<p>Being dragged along by her, we quietly made our way to the bathroom, and the shower was still running.</p>
<p>I was pressed against the bathroom wall, and this time, Osaki covered my mouth with her hand from the opposite side.</p>

<p>She brought her lips close to my ear and whispered in a small voice that could barely be heard over the shower noise.</p>

<p>“Hirakawa-kun, listen carefully to what I’m about to say. The things I tell you from now on are the truth.”</p>

<p>I was puzzled and asked my mind, ‘For what purpose?’ But it seemed like that question was expected, and Osaki continued to explain.</p>

<p>“There are bugs planted in my clothes during this love study abroad that have 5G mobile data connectivity. The recorded audio from the bugs is sent to my family’s company Osaki Holdings whenever it catches a signal. That was a condition for me to participate in this study abroad. Do you understand so far?”</p>

<p>I nodded.</p>
<p>While I still didn’t fully comprehend the reason, I grasped what was happening.</p>

<p>“Meaning, I can only speak the truth when I’m naked or wearing a swimsuit. Even now, my clothes in this room have bugs planted in them. If you raise your voice louder than the sound of the shower, it might be heard. If you understand all that, I’ll remove my hand and give you permission to speak. Got it?”</p>

<p>I nodded again.</p>

<p>“Thank you, Hirakawa-kun.”</p>

<p>With those words, she gently removed her hand from my mouth.</p>
<p>I followed her lead and brought my lips close to her ear, and we ended up in a posture where our lips were close to each other’s ears.</p>

<p>“How did things end up like that?”</p>
<p>“Hau…”</p>
<p>Hau?</p>

<p>“It’s… nothing.”</p>

<p>She said it was nothing, but while standing there, Osaki clung to me as if it were painful.</p>

<p>“Osaki, could it be…”</p>
<p>“Nngh…”</p>
<p>“Are your ears… sensitive?”</p>
<p>“I… don’t know…”</p>

<p>As her strength keeps diminishing, her clinging force becomes stronger.</p>

<p>“Is it hard for you to stand?”</p>
<p>“Y-Yeah…”</p>

<p>I see Osaki’s blushing ear nod meekly, and somewhere in my body, an abnormal reaction starts.</p>
<p>Wait, wait, wait, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9…!</p>
<p>I hurriedly start counting prime numbers, but it’s too slow (Also, I’m just saying odd numbers…).</p>
<p>Moreover, the close contact with her wet body inevitably triggers my physiological desires.</p>

<p>“W-What are you doing at a time like this?”</p>
<p>“You’re a bit too loud…!”</p>
<p>“Nnnh…”</p>

<p>Could you please stop making those sighs…</p>

<p>“I-I can’t control myself any longer. Enduring it will be tough, Hirakawa-kun…!”</p>

<p>Seeing the helpless state of both of us, Osaki turns the faucet knob forcefully, setting the water temperature to the coldest.</p>
<p>After being splashed with cold water, we both manage to regain some composure and finally become able to talk a little.</p>

<p>“A-Anyway… I don’t have time to explain in detail. I’m not someone who always takes long baths. If I do it only today, it will raise suspicions. Anyway, there’s one thing I want you to hear here.”</p>

<p>She seems to have composed herself a bit, speaking in a serious tone.</p>

<p>“I came here because I, myself, want to be with you.”</p>
<p>“Osaki herself…? Isn’t it for the prosperity of the family…?”</p>
<p>“No, it’s not like that. I don’t care what happens to Osaki Holdings. The political marriage, deceiving my family, and pretending to be interested in your position are all lies. The truth is, I just want to be with you, Hirakawa-kun.”</p>
<p>“That means…”</p>

<p>Startled, I move my lips away from her ear, and she continues.</p>

<p>“I didn’t actually plan to break up on that day.”</p>

<p>Osaki gazes at me with her teary eyes.</p>

<p>“I love you, Hirakawa-kun. I’m in love with you and I adore you more than anyone else in the world, always.”</p>
<p>“Osaki…”</p>

<p>Her confession shocks me immensely.</p>
<p>In that moment, questions like ‘Why didn’t you say this before?’ become insignificant.</p>
<p>The desperate, enchanting, beautiful Osaki in front of me captivates my senses.</p>

<p>“I finally said it!”</p>

<p>She sheds tears as big as pearls, burying her face in my chest.</p>

<p>“Hirakawa-kun, Hirakawa-kun, Hirakawa-kun…! I love you, love you, love you, Hirakawa-kun…! I finally said it…”</p>

<p>She presses her face against mine as if rubbing her eyes against mine.</p>
<p>Though I know it’s wrong, though I know it doesn’t justify my judgment, my heart is deeply stirred.</p>
<p>…That’s why I needed to ask one thing.</p>

<p>“…Is there any possibility that even this might be a lie?”</p>

<p>Osaki gently moves her face away from my chest and looks at me again with a serious expression.</p>

<p>“It’s natural not to believe me. Considering what happened… But…”</p>

<p>As she speaks, she gently touches my lips.</p>

<p>“I hope this can be some proof…”</p>
<p>“…It’s my first time being kissed.”</p>

<p>As I admit it, she responds, ‘Ah, what a coincidence. It’s my first time too.’</p>
<p>As her black hair and eyelashes glisten with water, she gives me a mischievous smile.</p>

<p>“Because someone I dated for the first time never did it for me, you see——”</p>
