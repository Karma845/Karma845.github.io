<h1>Chapter 4: Another Way to Devour Souls</h1>

<p>Miroslav Sauzar, the sorceress of “Falcon’s Sword,” was in a bad mood. The reason is obvious: she hasn’t been able to go out much for almost a month.</p>
<p>This is due to the request (order) from the adventurer’s guild to protect Miroslav.</p>
<p>It has been a month since Sora survived the Lord of Flies and disappeared from Ishka.</p>
<p>Sora, who holds a grudge against Miroslav, might try to do something against her, so she was transferred to a mansion prepared to protect her from danger.</p>
<p>However, Miroslav’s level has reached “15,” while Sora’s is “1,” so it is more than obvious that it’s the opposite she would try to attack him as soon as she sees him.</p>
<p>Naturally, the guild knew this, and in addition to that, measures were taken to prevent Miroslav from leaving.</p>
<p>It was a detention and punishment for attacking Sora when she was pursued by the Lord of Flies.</p>
<p>“This is irrational. What sins am I supposed to have committed?” Miroslav bit her nails in an empty room. No, she tried to, but stopped halfway. It was foolish to hurt her beautiful nails with her teeth.</p>
<p>There are no inconveniences with food and water, and she can read magic and academic books if she wishes. At first, she took it as a vacation.</p>
<p>That’s why she took extra care of her hair, nails, and skin. Care is always essential, but if you’re active as an adventurer, you’ll have limited time to take care of your beauty. In that sense, she pampered herself.</p>
<p>However, that kind of life continued for a month, and obviously, it depressed her.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Miroslav had never experienced such suffocating life while being observed.</p>
<p>It seems that Lars and the others were given a different type of job, so it was difficult to see them.</p>
<p>The fact that she didn’t know how long this life would continue also frustrated Miroslav.</p>
<p>Inevitably, that frustration fell on the person who caused it.</p>
<p>“Sora… Wouldn’t it be useless to let a man like him live? A man who couldn’t leave the tenth class for more than five years should feel honored to give his life to save Lars.”</p>
<p>Miroslav thought that Sora should be grateful to her because she tried to give him that honor.</p>
<p>A voice of undeniably hidden hatred could be heard from the sorceress, who had no remorse for attacking Sora.</p>
<p>Indeed, Miroslav does not consider her actions to be wrong. She is aware that her behavior was objectively problematic, but if she could rewind time, she would do the same thing again.</p>
<p>“I don’t care what happens to other men besides Lars.”</p>
<p>Miroslav’s voice affirmed that it was filled with hatred for Sora and for the existence of men in general.</p>
<p>A father who had many lovers due to the power of money.</p>
<p>Students from the Academy of Sages who harassed a young Miroslav simply because they lost against her.</p>
<p>The memories of other men apart from Lars meant nothing to her. To that Miroslav, entering a group with men was nothing more than a headache. If it weren’t for Lars inviting her, she would have strongly opposed it.</p>
<p>Fortunately, Sora had a talent limit problem, so she only endured it for half a year, but still, that frustration she felt didn’t disappear.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Miroslav, who thought that an incompetent like Sora should be erased from the glorious record of “Falcon’s Sword,” She continued to show hostility towards Sora after expelling him from the group.</p>
<p>It would be better if he died, but she couldn’t do that. So she decided to drive him out of the city. Never seeing him again was the same as him being dead.</p>
<p>Miroslav spread rumors and bad reviews to corner Sora. They worked well, and one of the surest ones was spreading the infamous nickname “Parasite.”</p>
<p>“Hehe, that moment, the sight of that man’s back.”</p>
<p>Miroslav exclaimed with joy as she recalled Sora’s figure leaving the bar as if escaping.</p>
<p>It was an event in a bar that caused Sora to be hostile towards Luna Maria. In fact, it was the work of Miroslav, using Sauzar’s influence.</p>
<p>She instructed the store employee to invite Sora to the store and had him sit in a special seat.</p>
<p>After that, Miroslav invited Iria and Luna Maria to go out to eat and they casually sat nearby.</p>
<p>At that moment, the plan would be completed if Luna Maria called Sora a “Parasite.”</p>
<p>Indeed, Luna Maria didn’t refer to Sora as a “Parasite,” but rather spoke of creatures in nature itself.</p>
<p>It was Miroslav who connected that act of parasitism to the adventurer groups based on those words, and it was also her who put Sora in that situation and connected the two things. It was as if Luna Maria had attacked Sora.</p>
<p>Miroslav, pretending to be drunk and taking advantage of Luna Maria’s confusion, along with Iria, said, “It’s a great name for a man like him” while laughing.</p>
<p>Luna Maria was angry at their words but thought they were just drunken ramblings, so she didn’t blame them.</p>
<p>She would have never thought that Sora would be sitting nearby. As a result, everything went as Miroslav had planned.</p>
<p>The reason Miroslav did all that was to break the relationship between Sora and Luna Maria.</p>
<p>Luna Maria was the closest to Sora when he joined “Falcon’s Sword.”</p>
<p>The shock to Sora would be immense if he knew that Luna Maria called him a “Parasite.”</p>
<p>In this way, if the two distanced themselves, Luna Maria, who sympathizes with Sora, would eliminate the risk of her making any plans to bring Sora back to the group.</p>
<p>Furthermore, Miroslav originally hated Luna Maria, so this plan included the aspect of harassing her.</p>
<p>When she had isolated herself from the surroundings of the Academy of Sages, the existence of the elf princess was a nuisance to her.</p>
<p>And Miroslav, who had finally left the academy, didn’t have the right to call herself a sage like Luna Maria, so that also annoyed her.</p>
<p>The reason she didn’t try to drive her out like she did with Sora was because of her great skills as an adventurer.</p>
<p>In any case, Miroslav’s plan was almost perfect. The only and biggest miscalculation in this plan was that Sora stayed in the city of Ishka. It was something that not even Miroslav could foresee. If possible, she would have continued until breaking his heart, but if she went beyond that, it could expose her intentions.</p>





<p>In particular, she could no longer use Luna Maria. In the end, all Miroslav could do was wait for Sora to leave the city and let her bad reputation spread.</p>
<p>“I should have bullied him harder at that moment,” she murmured with slight regret.</p>
<p>However, if Sora had left Ishka at that time, she wouldn’t have been able to use him as bait when they were attacked by the Lord of Flies. Considering that, her judgment wasn’t wrong.</p>
<p>If Sora had been killed by the Lord of Flies, everything would have ended silently. It was at that moment when Miroslav seriously thought about it.</p>
<p>The door to the room opened with a rattling sound. Miroslav frowned at that.</p>
<p>She thought it might be a guild member who entered without knocking. Similar cases had occurred before.</p>
<p>Especially since it was a woman, the guild master had assigned a male staff member for surveillance.</p>
<p>Miroslav had protested many times, but there were no signs that anyone was paying attention.</p>
<p>The precious guild employees couldn’t stay here just for surveillance purposes for several days. Surely that’s what they thought. That’s also why Miroslav’s intentions were clear.</p>
<p>She attempted to strike the intruder in the room with great force.</p>
<p>However…</p>
<p>“What…!?”</p>
<p>Realizing it, the perpetrator was right behind Miroslav. She opened her eyes wide in astonishment. It was a speed that could only be described as magical.</p>
<p>The next moment, a punch struck Miroslav’s stomach. Upon receiving that relentless blow, she lost consciousness in an instant.</p>
<p>Just before the unconscious redhead sorceress fell to the floor, her body was lifted slightly by the perpetrator.</p>
<p>The perpetrator left the room while holding Miroslav just as she was. It was such a swift and precise job that not even 30 seconds had passed since entering the room.</p>
<p>——————————————————————</p>
<p>“Where… am I…?”</p>
<p>That was Miroslav’s first voice when she woke up. Lying down, she raised only the upper part of her body and fixed her disheveled hair with her hands.</p>
<p>Then, with a drowsy gesture, she looked around, devoid of her usual venomous gaze.</p>
<p>As she silently observed, her wandering gaze shifted towards me. It seemed she had finally realized that someone was near her, and Miroslav raised her gaze.</p>
<p>“Lars…?”</p>
<p>It was the first time I saw the drowsy eyes of the sorceress. Shortly after, her eyes gradually focused. At that moment, it didn’t take her long to figure it out.</p>
<p>“No… You’re not Lars… Sora?”</p>
<p>Miroslav stood up in astonishment. Faced with the confused sorceress looking around, I decided to inform her about this place.</p>
<p>“This is the Lord of Flies’ nest. To be more precise, it’s a cave that used to be the Lord of Flies’ nest. It’s located deep in Tittis.”</p>
<p>“It’s a ridiculous lie. There’s no way a level ‘1’ like you could make it to the deepest part. We’re somewhere on the outer periphery, right? If you’re talking about the deep nest of the Lord of Flies, it’s just a trick to make me give up on escaping, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>While remaining cautious of me, Miroslav shouted as if screaming. Apparently, she had more or less guessed her situation in this short time. In that case, it makes things easier.</p>
<p>“Believe it or not, it’s up to you. The fact remains the same anyway.”</p>
<p>“Do you think you can do something like this and get away with it?”</p>
<p>“That’s my line, Miroslav Sauzar. I don’t intend to let ‘Falcon’s Sword’ or the guild off the hook. You are just the beginning.”</p>
<p>“You’re just talking nonsense. It seems you don’t know your place. You’re wasting your life just when you managed to survive.”</p>
<p>“Thanks for the advice. But more importantly, don’t you have something else to worry about? For example, how is it possible that a level ‘1’ person like me could carry you while unconscious and bring your sorry ass to the depths?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing my words, anger vanished from Miroslav’s face, and instead, great doubt arose. She appeared like a scholar trying to solve a difficult problem.</p>
<p>“What…? That a level ‘1’ could bring me all the way to Tittis by themselves? No way—no, necessarily, we’re not even in Tittis. Saying the word ‘deep’ is just a trick to make me believe this is the Tittis Forest. But if this isn’t Tittis, then where are we? No, more importantly, how were you able to capture me and leave Ishka? What were the guild staff who were watching me and the city guards doing?”</p>
<p>Miroslav muttered her assumptions. And as for the answer to her question, the guild staff’s surveillance was poor, and as for the guards, I hadn’t even seen them because I didn’t go through the city gate.</p>
<p>I didn’t use the gate and left Ishka through the city walls.</p>
<p>Whether it’s entering or leaving the city, it’s a crime to do it through the walls, but if you’re not caught, then it’s not a crime. Of course, I didn’t bother explaining that to Miroslav.</p>
<p>“I’ll answer your questions slowly later. Because we’ll be living here for a while, after all.”</p>
<p>“You’re just spouting nonsense! I’d rather die than live with you!”</p>
<p>Miroslav quickly distanced herself from me. Then, she looked at me as if seeing a magical beast–</p>
<p>“Envelop my enemy in death—Princess of Flames!”</p>
<p>She completed her magic without hesitation.</p>
<p>A band of flames burst forth from Miroslav’s palm. A large flame approached at a steady pace, and it engulfed my entire body in an instant.</p>
<p>Boom.</p>
<p>Along with a roar, the cave shook violently, and dust from the ground rose. Miroslav’s victorious voice echoed behind the curtain of smoke.</p>
<p>“Fifth-grade fire magic ‘Princess of Flames.’ How does it feel? For a level ‘1’ like you, didn’t that fifth-grade magic feel like a divine work? Ah, but, the power diminishes by omitting the incantation. You might have felt relieved when you took my staff, but your shallowness seems low-level. The rings, earrings, and bracelets I wear are made of magic stones. Even without my staff, I have no obstacles to using my magic.”</p>
<p>Miroslav just kept babbling. There was no doubt in her voice that she thought she had defeated me. However, there wasn’t a scratch on my body.</p>
<p>My energy-based defense completely blocked Miroslav’s magic.</p>
<p>Then, I uttered some sudden words to the smug sorceress.</p>
<p>“Seems like your shallowness is quite low-level. No, no, your rings and bracelets, I didn’t take them off because it wouldn’t make any difference anyway.”</p>
<p>“What…?!”</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Miroslav let out a confused voice upon hearing the person she was supposed to have burned.</p>
<p>The dust that obscured our vision gradually diminished, revealing our appearances again.</p>
<p>The sorceress’s eyes that looked at me were as wide open as if she couldn’t believe it.</p>
<p>“Why… Why are you still alive?”</p>
<p>“Must be because your magic was too weak. Would you like to try again with the incantation this time?”</p>
<p>“You… ‘Pierce through–Fire Needle!'”</p>
<p>When Miroslav activated her magic with angry eyes, a sharp and pointed flame approached my face.</p>
<p>A fire arrow–no, it was more like a fire lance.</p>
<p>According to Miroslav, it was second-grade fire magic. It’s weaker than the Princess of Flames, but it still has enough power to make me disappear if it hits me directly.</p>
<p>Regardless of her personality, Miroslav is excellent as a sorceress. Thinking that, I opened my mouth.</p>
<p>“Hah!”</p>
<p>Then, I extinguished the approaching flame with that voice. The red-haired sorceress, who was confident that her magic would make me disappear, stood dumbfounded and took one, two steps back.</p>
<p>“It can’t be… How is it possible for a level ‘1’ to withstand my magic…? W-What did you do?”</p>
<p>“That was an energy burst.”</p>
<p>“Energy… burst?”</p>
<p>“It’s a magic from my homeland. If I were to explain it in a mage’s interpretation, it would be that I released the magical power from my body to cancel out your magic—something like that.”</p>
<p>“Stop joking! My magic uses the magical power of the world. There’s no way you can cancel it with the magical power of your body! A-And besides, it’s impossible for a level ‘1’ like you to cancel the magic of a level ’15’ like me!”</p>
<p>She raised her voice, devoid of astonishment or anger. I simply chuckled.</p>
<p>“I don’t care if you refuse to acknowledge the facts. There’s no need to convince you.”</p>
<p>As I said those words, I closed the distance between Miroslav and me in an instant, and swiftly kicked her feet, making her fall to the ground. Ignoring her agonized voice, I held her fallen body as if covering her. Miroslav couldn’t react to my movements at all.</p>
<p>“L-Let go of me, you scum!”</p>
<p>Miroslav started thrashing violently to try to escape.</p>
<p>However, I strengthened my physical strength with energy, so her resistance was as weak as that of a child.</p>
<p>I didn’t loosen my grip even for a moment, and continued holding Miroslav’s body with both hands and feet.</p>
<p>Despite being in that position on the cave floor, she glared at me angrily.</p>
<p>“What… What are you going to do with me?”</p>
<p>“You’re no longer a brat, so I’m sure you already know.”</p>
<p>As I taunted her with those words, Miroslav’s face turned pale. Seeing her reaction, I burst into laughter from the depths of my throat.</p>
<p>This is the place where the larvae devoured me alive. A place where I shed tears, nasal secretions, and even urine while pleading for survival. I remember it as if it were yesterday.</p>
<p>There’s no better place to make Miroslav experience humiliation and fear—the revenge I had held onto until now boiled, and the corners of my lips naturally curved upward.</p>
<p>Miroslav, who saw that up close, radiated intense light in her eyes as her face grew paler. A clear fighting spirit.</p>
<p>“Magical solution–“</p>
<p>Miroslav tried to cast magic with a sharp voice. It was probably one of her trump cards, but of course, I didn’t stand idly by waiting for her to do it.</p>
<p>—I forcefully interrupted her incantation by sealing her lips with mine.</p>
<p>At first, Miroslav seemed unable to comprehend what had happened. She was stunned, eyes wide open. But she quickly understood the situation, let out a hoarse scream, and struggled like a cat that had fallen into water.</p>
<p>I smiled cruelly and attempted to move on to the next stage.</p>
<p>At that moment.</p>
<p>—That something arrived abruptly.</p>
<p>——————————————————————</p>
<p>DONG, my heart beat violently. An impulse similar to sexual desire ran through my body.</p>
<p>When I realized it, I was holding Miroslav’s body tightly in my arms. She was screaming, but I didn’t care.</p>
<p>As I embraced Miroslav, I pressed my lips against hers even more forcefully than before, forcing them open—’Devour.’ Her soul, which is the most important thing to her.</p>
<p>At that moment, Miroslav’s body jerked in my arms. I don’t know what kind of sensation she feels when devouring her soul.</p>
<p>However, it seems safe to say that it’s something she has never felt before. Miroslav desperately shook her face, trying to make me let go of her.</p>
<p>But I ignored her actions. I mean, I wasn’t even looking at her. Because I was completely absorbed in the tremendous pleasure.</p>
<p>The pleasure I felt when I cut the larvae and the Lord of Flies continued as I sucked on those lips.</p>
<p>And it wasn’t just that. My mouth was filled with a melted sweetness. They say a girl’s lips are sweet, and it wasn’t just a metaphor, it was truly sweet.</p>
<p>It was a sweetness that reminded me of a fine honey liqueur that surpassed everything, and I was enjoying it like never before.</p>
<p>Drink, drink, drink, just drink. How many times had I repeated that?</p>
<p>In my arms, Miroslav had a flushed face as if she had a fever, while her whole body relaxed as if she were in awe.</p>
<p>Obviously, that seemed strange, but I kept acting on impulse.</p>
<p>I kept going, kept going, kept going, and before I knew it, my level had increased to ‘6’.</p>
<p>An ability to devour an opponent by overlapping with them. Another way to devour souls. With this new power, I decided to change my revenge plan, which I had worked on until now.</p>
<p>The original plan was to capture Miroslav, then inform Lars and the others and try to lure them into the depths of this place.</p>
<p>Everyone in ‘Falcon’s Sword’ are adventurers with double-digit levels, and I hoped that the value of their souls would be considerable.</p>
<p>However, I noticed  something</p>
<p>Naturally, once you kill them, you can only devour their soul once.</p>
<p>As I come to that inevitable conclusion , I’ve come to realization, those souls are more valuable.</p>
<p>In that sense, it was a fact that I thought there might be a way to make better use of “Falcon’s Sword.”</p>





<p>Furthermore, if I were to simply kill them, they wouldn’t taste the fear and despair that I suffered in the Lord of Flies’ nest.</p>
<p>I wanted to throw them into that hell as deep and long as possible, as if drowning them in a muddy swamp of agony—I always had such a dark idea in my heart.</p>
<p>That’s why this recently developed ability pleased me. With this, I can inflict much deeper and prolonged suffering upon “Falcon’s Sword” than just killing them. And since my level also increases, I have no complaints.</p>
<p>The soul devourer is somewhat similar with sexual activity, and if I make a mistake, I could be identified as a vampire or another monster, so I have to act with caution, but this is deep in Tittis.</p>
<p>No one will notice what I do. I continued to harass Miroslav day and night to learn more about this ability. She is someone who once tried to kill me. No matter what happens to her, my heart feels no guilt or anything like that.</p>
<p>And the newly acquired knowledge is as follows.</p>
<p>First, the soul will recover to some extent if it rests like physical strength or magical power. If I devour part of the souls I will recover a bit the next day.</p>
<p>Moreover, regarding this amount of recovery, it seems that if you devour many part of the souls at once, it will take a long time to recover.</p>
<p>If I devour tenth parts of souls, the amount of recovery the next day will be one, but if I devour five, the amount of recovery the next day will be two, and if it’s seven, it will be three.</p>
<p>Regarding the numbers, it’s according to my experience, but there’s no doubt that the number of souls devoured affects the amount of recovery the next day.</p>
<p>Devour moderately and rest moderately. That way, the soul can be efficiently exploited. After knowing that, I stopped excessively harassing Miroslav.</p>
<p>As a result, Miroslav’s attitude also changed slightly. At first, she resisted violently every time I approached her and often attacked with magic, but in the past few days, that stopped, and she has been very calm.</p>
<p>Her expression was disgusting as always, and after finishing talking, she made grimaces again and again, but at least, that resistance she had stopped.</p>
<p>It’s possible that she’s afraid I will harass her like in the previous days if she tries to do something foolish.</p>
<p>Moreover, upon observing Miroslav’s state, it seems that she felt a slight sense of pleasure when I devour her soul.</p>
<p>It’s probably a mental and physical defense reaction to devouring her soul. When a vampire sucks the blood of a virgin, that person reacts with sexual pleasure, so it seems to be something like that.</p>
<p>And Miroslav was on guard against this pleasure. Well, pleasure is amusing since it’s something temporary, and by forcing her to experience pleasure against her will for a long time, it’s equivalent to torture.</p>
<p>This must be another reason why Miroslav’s attitude changed. With that in mind, I decided to move the plan to the next stage.</p>
<p>Although the soul can be devoured efficiently, I’ve already noticed that one person is not enough</p>
<p>The next plan is to “Increase the providers.” Conveniently, there are still two women in “Falcon’s Sword,” Iria and Luna Maria, so I will go after them.</p>
<p>However, even if it’s to increase my providers, it’s risky to capture them like Miroslav and take them to the nest.</p>
<p>With Miroslav’s disappearance, Lars, the others, and the guild must be more vigilant than ever.</p>
<p>There’s no guarantee that I can do the same as before, even if no one can find me, I can’t live in hiding forever.</p>
<p>Ideally, Miroslav, Luna Maria, and Iria would follow me of their own accord. Of course, there’s no way that would happen naturally, so I have to act.</p>
<p>The steps to achieve that are already in my head. For that, it is first necessary for Miroslav to obey me. For her to willingly obey me and set a trap for her comrades, originally, that’s something that would never happen. But I’ve been seeking the information to make it possible in the past few days.</p>
<p>In the morning, I asked Miroslav a question as she came out of the camping tent I prepared for her, with a straightforward attitude, to connect our lips.</p>
<p>“Now that I think about it, why haven’t you had any experience with men? I thought you had already slept with Lars a long time ago.”</p>
<p>“What…?”</p>
<p>Miroslav was momentarily stunned, suddenly creasing her brow deeply.</p>
<p>“That’s none of your concern.”</p>
<p>The response I was expecting came, so I laughed mockingly and reached out toward Miroslav’s clothing.</p>
<p>“True, it’s none of my concern. In that case, there’s no problem if I take it, right?”</p>
<p>“Please, stop!”</p>
<p>After screaming, Miroslav quickly lowered her gaze. If she didn’t respond, it seems she would understand that I had actually taken measures in this half-month confinement life.</p>
<p>“…I won’t become anyone’s lover or concubine. Even if it’s Lars.”</p>
<p>“Do you mean you won’t have relationships until after marriage and become an official wife?”</p>
<p>Upon hearing Miroslav’s words, I crossed my arms. In the marital system of the Kingdom of Canaria, it’s monogamous for commoners, and polygamous for aristocrats.</p>
<p>More specifically, the lower nobility (knights/barons) can have two wives, and the higher nobility (Counts or above with territories) can have three wives.</p>
<p>This is common in continental countries, even the Adastela Empire, and in general, an “official wife” refers to the women included in this framework.</p>
<p>Women who are not included in this framework are called lovers or concubines.</p>
<p>What Miroslav means is that no matter if it’s Lars, she won’t accept any position other than being the official wife.</p>
<p>“Will you accept it calmly if Lars chooses Iria instead?”</p>
<p>“Hmph! In time, Lars will receive a recommendation to become a knight. If necessary, a meeting can be arranged within the Sauzar company!”</p>
<p>“I see.”</p>
<p>Even if she becomes the second wife, she’s still an official wife. It seems her pride was overflowing. Miroslav was smiling as if imagining such a scene.</p>
<p>However, that smile quickly disappeared when she saw me in front of her.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>I brought my face closer and attacked Miroslav to use my ability. Besides, if I had planned to return her alive, this is something I wouldn’t do. So, there’s no reason to value the virginity of a woman whom I don’t plan to let live. It seems Miroslav was aware of that.</p>
<p>“After all, this is the most effective revenge for you.”</p>
<p>With a frivolous voice and expression, I reached out for Miroslav’s clothing again. Although she resisted this time, I didn’t stop. As I tore her clothes, her underwear covering her breasts was exposed.</p>
<p>Miroslav resisted violently, her face tensing as if feeling something different from yesterday, but I simply pushed her to the ground and held my hand over the redhead mage.</p>
<p>Then, my hand moved from her breasts to her belly, and when I tried to go further down, Miroslav let out a scream.</p>
<p>“N-No…!”</p>
<p>Large tears streamed from her eyes.</p>
<p>“I decided to give… my first time… to Lars… please… stop… I beg you… I’ll apologize…”</p>
<p>It’s the first time I’ve seen her tears. For her, being violated by me would be more painful than death. If I actually do it, she might die from the shock.</p>
<p>Thinking about that, I released Miroslav, driven by pity and guilt—Ha! As if!</p>
<p>“—HA! Stop being selfish, ‘Murderer’!”</p>
<p>I laughed at Miroslav, who was full of tears, then I pressed my hands against her throat. She was coughing, unable to breathe, but I kept squeezing. I was the one strangling her, but it was a fact that I became very angry while watching Miroslav cry.</p>
<p>I remembered when I was attacked by the larvae, when I cried, when I begged for my life. Now I’m holding the cause of that in my hands.</p>
<p>Brutal thoughts screamed in my brain, telling me to take everything from this woman.</p>
<p>However, considering what I have planned, that would be taking the easy way out.</p>
<p>Precisely because the mage Miroslav has this type of personality, I told myself that she could be useful for my plans, so I forced myself to suppress my desire for revenge for now.</p>
<p>Then, leaning close to Miroslav’s ear, I gave the redhead mage a condition.</p>
<p>——————————————————————</p>
<p>A few days later, when I left the cave for a change of mood, I started gathering medicinal herbs under the sunlight.</p>
<p>Currently, I’m gathering medicinal herbs, as ingredients for oily or salty dishes. They were rare herbs, and the rewards set by the guild were high.</p>
<p>The herbs are in clusters; I suppose I should say that it’s because this is deep in Tittis.</p>
<p>I can also see other plants that I know, they’re all very rare together. A month ago, I would have been picking them with sparkling eyes.</p>
<p>Now I don’t make a living by collecting them, so I don’t have to cling to the herbs. But it was a habit of several years, even though I couldn’t find anything that sells at a high price.</p>
<p>Silently collecting herbs like this in nature calms my mind and—Ah, no, not that.</p>
<p>I only intended to think that, but unexpectedly I found myself engrossed in collecting the herbs in front of me.</p>
<p>I shook my head slightly and discarded the herbs, then I started thinking again about the future.</p>
<p>As for the plan to deal with “Falcon’s Sword,” Miroslav still hadn’t given me an answer a few days after our conversation.</p>
<p>Well, if she agreed immediately to set a trap for her comrades, it’s obvious that she would be suspicious.</p>
<p>In a way, the fact that she still hasn’t responded is proof that Miroslav is doubting it.</p>
<p>If your heart is doubting, it means you’re not vehemently denying it, so Miroslav will likely nodded her head soon.</p>
<p>After putting my thoughts together, I decided to move on to the next step.</p>
<p>The next step is a question that arises as I repeatedly devour Miroslav’s soul.</p>
<p>That is—</p>
<p>“Isn’t my strength strange?”</p>
<p>To be direct, am I not too strong?</p>
<p>In another aspect, I would like to tell myself, “Why are you getting carried away?” and indeed, I think that’s the case.</p>
<p>The first time I questioned it was when I kidnapped Miroslav and she woke up in the cave.</p>
<p>At that time, I was able to withstand Miroslav’s enchanted magic with just the protection of my energy. No, rather than saying I withstood it, I didn’t receive a scratch.</p>
<p>I did it because I thought I might be able to, but I didn’t think it would be possible to prevent it. I haven’t been able to use energy until now, so I’m a beginner.</p>
<p>Despite the fact that the amount of energy increased due to acquiring my soul equipment, the management of energy is the same as before.</p>
<p>In that sense, is it possible to effortlessly avoid Miroslav’s magic, which is famous among adventurers and mages? My level is still “6”.</p>
<p>Yes, speaking of level, this was also a question.</p>
<p>That day, my level hasn’t increased since I devoured Miroslav’s soul and reached level “6”.</p>
<p>It was approximately half a month that I captured Miroslav, and I devoured her soul every day, but it didn’t seem to increase. This is concerning.</p>
<p>Previously, when I devoured the highest number of souls, it was when I defeated the Lord of Flies. At that time, I was at level “4” and jumped to “5” after devouring it.</p>
<p>If I were to say that the Lord of Flies’ soul was worth 10, then Miroslav’s soul would be worth about 4 to 5 per day.</p>
<p>I’ve been devouring souls for half a month, so the total number of souls I’ve obtained should be over fifty. I believe that should be enough to level up, but my level hasn’t budged from “6”.</p>
<p>Of course, I understand that as the level increases, the next level becomes more difficult to reach.</p>
<p>It’s understandable that the required experience value increases more at “6” than it did at “5”, and even more at “7” than it did at “6”. I never wondered about this in the case of levels “20” or “30”.</p>
<p>However, my level is “6” and remains “6”. Still, isn’t this difficulty increase abnormal?</p>
<p>“I thought souls provided a higher experience value… but how is it that the others are leveling up while I can’t?</p>
<p>If the number of souls I devoured in this half-month translates into experience points like it does for others, it should be monstrous.</p>
<p>I don’t believe other adventurers at level “6” need as much experience as I do. If it’s a matter of individual difference, I am clearly far beyond that.</p>
<p>The only explanation I could think of is that I require much more experience to level up than others.</p>
<p>If it takes hundreds for a regular person, would I need over 10,000? If that’s not the case, then I can’t explain the current situation.</p>
<p>If that assumption is true, then I wouldn’t be leveling up like a human but like a dragon.</p>
<p>“I really don’t know…” I muttered. When I acquired my soul equipment, it didn’t seem so bad.</p>
<p>My Anima is the Soul Eater dragon. If that’s the case, it’s very possible that my body has something like the dragon factor.</p>
<p>If this idea is correct, then it answers the question I had for years. The question of why my level didn’t go beyond “1”.</p>
<p>One of the common methods of leveling up—defeating weaker monsters hundreds or thousands of times won’t increase experience.</p>
<p>…Compared to a dragon, all monsters are weaklings.</p>
<p>Unless I defeat mythical creatures, I won’t gain experience points. In that sense, it’s natural that my level didn’t increase on Onigashima or Ishka.</p>
<p>Another reasoning derived from that. If the conditions for leveling up differ from others due to the dragon factor, then the skill improvement that comes with leveling up should also be different from others.</p>
<p>A level indicating strength as a human and a level indicating strength as a dragon. Perhaps my level and the levels of others are fundamentally different.</p>
<p>“Goodness… it would be better to not only see the numerical value of my level but also of experience and skill.”</p>
<p>I couldn’t help but murmur. If my status showed something like “Dragon Warrior, Level 1,” my days would have been different. Well, there’s no point in complaining now.</p>
<p>Furthermore, now that I have the opportunity to strengthen myself, I can believe that those days had some meaning. I recalled when I was expelled from my homeland.</p>
<p>Now I can fight, so I can return to the island. Considering the strength of the monsters on Onigashima, there’s no doubt I could devour many promising souls.</p>
<p>My father. I don’t think he will reinstate me as the eldest son, but it’s possible to make him reconsider if I show him my strength.</p>
<p>The image of my father appeared in my head. The Mitsurugi family that protects Onigashima and its eight squads.</p>





<p>Raising the flag with the seal of the demon god, from the highest rank to the lowest, all guardians of the island were users of the Illusory Sword Style.</p>
<p>His name is Seirin Hatsuki.</p>
<p>Seirin is the old name for Onigashima. Rather, the official name is still that.</p>
<p>Most people only call it Onigashima, but the elders of the island still refer to it as Seirin Island.</p>
<p>In the past, it is said that before the demonic gate appeared, Onigashima was a picturesque island with lush trees.</p>
<p>Well, that was over 300 years ago, even the elders have never seen it with their own eyes.</p>
<p>Seirin Hatsuki’s battle attire was a symbol of strength and a longing for me. It was my dream to wear that garment alongside my father. Now I have reached a point where I could make that dream come true.</p>
<p>It was also about fulfilling my promise when I left the island.</p>
<p>“Someday, I will definitely return. I will return with the power to fight on this island.”</p>
<p>I remembered that regret as if it were yesterday. In that case—no, I suppose that’s why I didn’t have the feeling of returning to the island.</p>
<p>Even if I return and luckily join Seirin, at best I will be sent to a low rank.</p>
<p>It’s better than being treated as a weakling, but I don’t want to live a life where I am trampled upon by my father, Ayaka, Raguna, the apprentices, and the Goz and Cecil brothers.</p>
<p>When I was expelled, I was eager to be recognized… but, hm, if I think about it now, I didn’t want to be recognized. I just wanted to be seen.</p>
<p>I wanted to be stronger than everyone else, so I could rub it in their faces. I wanted to prove that the people who looked down on me were wrong.</p>
<p>—So, it’s still too early.</p>
<p>I can still become stronger. Devouring Miroslav, devouring “Falcon Sword,” devouring the guild, and becoming much stronger.</p>
<p>By devouring everything I can—I will return to that island. I will return and prove it. I have surpassed them. This is Mitsurugi Sora.</p>
<p>It has become quite different from what I once dreamed of, but it can’t be helped now. Because I can no longer sympathize with the teaching of protecting the Mitsurugi family and the Illusory Sword Style.</p>
<p>I have never forgotten it, but I will engrave it in my heart again. I won’t stop with my revenge against Miroslav and the others. However, I will be cautious of what lies ahead of my revenge, so I don’t fall into it. Honestly, there’s a part of me that was intoxicated with power after acquiring my soul equipment!</p>
<p>I never thought I would be collecting herbs again. From now on, if something happens, I may need to collect herbs. In a meditative sense.</p>
<p>I thought about that and looked around. As I noticed, there were several medicinal herbs piled up that I had gathered from my surroundings.</p>
<p>It happened when I tried to return to the cave after collecting the medicinal herbs I had stacked.</p>
<p>Suddenly, the ground shook violently as my body reacted to it.</p>
<p>At first, I thought it was an earthquake, but there was a series of fierce battle sounds that seemed to come from magical beasts, so it seems that this shaking is due to a battle between large magical beasts.</p>
<p>From the sound and the volume transmitted, it can be understood that the battle is quite intense. Judging by the number of voices, there seem to be more than ten magical beasts.</p>
<p>However, most of them seem to be of the same type, so the battle may be many against one. Perhaps it’s a group of magical beasts trying to hunt down a large prey.</p>
<p>Then, a loud roar was heard. From the voice, it was not “many” but “one.” In other words, it is the one being hunted.</p>
<p>It was probably its last effort—the monster leaped into the sky, flapping its wings with force—but it failed and fell back to the ground.</p>
<p>If it had jumped onto the terrain and landed there, there wouldn’t have been any issues. However, it seems that it was flying at a certain angle, and the landing location was greatly displaced.</p>
<p>In other words, a winged magical beast appeared in my line of sight. It was a subspecies of a two-legged dragon with indigo-colored scales. It was a magical beast called the Indigo Wyvern.</p>
<p>And what appeared after the Wyvern was…</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>“[Shushishishi! How mysterious, how mysterious. There’s a human in this place.]”</p>



<p>A man-eating magical beast with the face of an old man, lion’s body, and scorpion’s tail—a Manticore. Manticores are carnivorous beasts with human-like faces that live deep in the forest.</p>



<p>Their face resembles that of an old man, and they can speak the human language. However, they are not friendly even with flattery. If you encounter one, a battle is sure to ensue.</p>



<p>The lion’s body is as agile as it looks, it can run smoothly in the forest as if it were on level ground, so escaping is nearly impossible.</p>



<p>The extremely venomous scorpion tail has 24 spines, a strike from which is destructive enough to shatter a large tree. It is also said that some manticores can use those spines as projectiles.</p>



<p>It was a type of magical beast you wouldn’t want to encounter in the forest.</p>



<p>“And there are ten manticores. I really don’t know how to describe this encounter.”</p>



<p>A group of manticores appeared one after another, following the Wyvern. I sighed and placed the bag full of herbs on the ground. Whether I fight or escape, it will only be an obstacle. I swore I would pick it up when everything was over.</p>



<p>“[Shushishi! Not as tasty as a winged beast, but humans have their own flavor. Curse your bad luck for encountering us in this place.]”</p>



<p>A Manticore spoke to me, mocking me. I decided to test if what I had read before was true.</p>



<p>“The sun rises from the west, the river flows backward from east to west, and fire burns in water. Do you know what that is?”</p>



<p>“[Speak all you want, your fate has already been determined, shushishi!]”</p>



<p>The Manticore disregarded my words. Just because they can speak the human language doesn’t mean they are necessarily willing to converse.</p>



<p>The Manticore only said what it wanted and was unwilling to speak—oh well, it’s just as it was written in the records. There’s no need to waste saliva.</p>



<p>While I was contemplating that, the Manticore in front of me continued to spew words.</p>



<p>“The winged beast fell, the human will die, and our stomachs will be full. Shushishishi! Pleasurable, truly pleasurable.”</p>



<p>“Then die with that pleasure—reborn soul equipment.”</p>



<p>The moment I manifested my soul equipment, the Manticores trembled like leaves in the wind. The one that had been speaking to me stopped moving its mouth.</p>



<p>It was evident that it was on guard, but I would have preferred it to be so until I got into position.</p>



<p>Because my soul equipment in this state is just a weapon at first glance.</p>



<p>“Devour it all, Soul Eater.”</p>



<p>I got into position.</p>



<p>The Manticores recoiled in fear at the black flash. As I watched them, I lowered my body. The katana is at my left hip, the Sword facing the other side.</p>



<p>As for the stance, it’s almost like a draw technique, but my soul equipment doesn’t have a sheath, so it’s only similar.</p>



<p>With this posture, I will channel energy into the Sword. The technique I will use is Tornado, the technique I used in the battle against the Fly King.</p>



<p>However, that technique is like an imitation of what I saw on the island. Still, I didn’t mind because it had enough power, but I was interested in what would happen if I put all my current power into it.</p>



<p>That joy when I was freed from the curse of level “1”. But the fact that I am at level “6” still haunts me. It defies the common sense of being a human.</p>



<p>I don’t need underestimation or overestimation. It’s simply about putting everything as I am “now”.</p>



<p>Increasing energy. Greater increase of energy. Tremendous increase of energy.</p>



<p>The energy spirals and fiercely covers the Sword. It’s like a flame, like a small dragon.</p>



<p>Space contracts. My soul equipment roars, wanting to devour souls as soon as possible.</p>



<p>It seems the Manticore from earlier instinctively sensed the tremendous increase in power, so it spoke loudly to the surrounding group.</p>



<p>“Fly!”</p>



<p>“Too slow!”</p>



<p>With that shout, I swung my black katana horizontally. It was a distance that I couldn’t reach considering the enemy’s range.</p>



<p>However, the cut of my highly energized black katana turned that distance to zero in an instant.</p>



<p>More than saying it was a cut, it was as if it had devoured space itself. No matter how agile the magical beasts are, they can’t avoid this attack.</p>



<p>Several Manticores cried out in astonishment and pain, falling to the ground, spraying blood. The number was five, half of the group.</p>



<p>It seems the others were not within the range of the cut from the beginning, or perhaps they quickly obeyed the leader’s orders.</p>



<p>My next target was the three that were fleeing in the air. I adjusted my stance, swinging the katana to the side.</p>



<p>As I saw the leader with wide-open eyes, the corners of my mouth naturally lifted.</p>



<p>“Die!”</p>



<p>Without wings, you can’t dodge attacks in the air. My second attack slightly eradicated the three.</p>



<p>Originally, the bodies of Manticores are covered in tough muscles, and their outer skin is greasy and not easy to penetrate.</p>



<p>However, my black katana sliced through the Manticores’ bodies like tofu, and three blood flowers bloomed in the air. Immediately after, a large number of souls flowed, and an “ugh” slipped out of my throat unintentionally.</p>



<p>After all, I am strong. How can you explain to a human that they instantaneously killed eight man-eating Manticores that many fear?</p>



<p>The inference about the previous level was correct. My perception until now was mistaken. Convinced of that, I clenched my fists.</p>



<p>Alright, I just need to finish off the remaining two. So, when I turned my gaze towards the surviving Manticores—–</p>



<p>“GRUOOOOOOOOO!!”</p>



<p>I saw the Wyvern crushing the skull of one Manticore and smashing the back of the other with a single blow.</p>



<p>Both probably died instantly. The indigo-colored scales of the Wyvern were stained with blood, with more than half of its scales peeled off, revealing the flesh beneath.</p>



<p>It was gravely injured. An Indigo Wyvern is known to be fierce and brutal among the Wyvern species. Regardless of the damage it received, if the opponent is one or two Manticores, it seems to have enough power to handle them.</p>



<p>…Well, the question now is whether the Wyvern will attack me. I saved it in the end, but I don’t think it understands that.</p>







<p>Speaking of cruelty, there is not much difference between the Indigo Wyvern and the Manticores. They share the same hostility towards humans. So, it wouldn’t be surprising if it attacked me at this moment.</p>



<p>By the way, Wyverns can be used by humans. The Dragon Knights of the Kingdom of Canaria ride on winged beasts.</p>



<p>However, I heard that to achieve that, they basically have to raise them from an egg by human hands.</p>



<p>For wild winged beasts, humans are just food, and it seems they can’t get accustomed even if raised that way.</p>



<p>The Indigo Wyvern, which is the highest among the Wyvern species, has a particularly strong tendency in that regard.</p>



<p>When the Wyvern spat out the chewed-up Manticore’s head, it turned its gaze towards me.</p>



<p>I thought it would attack me, so I got into position, but unexpectedly, the winged beast didn’t attack. It was staring at me with calm eyes. I wondered what I should do as it looked at me with those snake-like vertical pupils.</p>



<p>Suddenly, the Wyvern’s line of sight shifted away from me and turned in another direction. Almost at the same time, I did too.</p>



<p>It was one of the Manticores, apparently the leader, that was still alive and standing.</p>



<p>At that moment, the Indigo Wyvern let out a tremendous roar. That fury and hostility were clearly directed towards the Manticore.</p>



<p>The Wyvern’s long neck swelled up, and something like vapor overflowed from its mouth. It was a sign of its fire breath.</p>



<p>— Wait a moment! Can an Indigo Wyvern breathe fire? Is it safe to release a fire breath in the middle of this forest?</p>



<p>I thought about it, but from the Wyvern’s perspective, the Manticore is an enemy that had hurt it and tried to eat it. That fear and anger of being on the verge of being devoured, I recall it with regret.</p>



<p>I hesitated whether I should interfere with the winged beast that was trying to make the Manticore pay for its resentment.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the mouth of the Indigo Wyvern exhaled a mass of fire the size of a human head. It flew straight through the air and struck the Manticore that was trying to escape.</p>



<p>As if to demonstrate the strength of it, the Manticore couldn’t even scream, it just burned in flames.</p>



<p>After that, I looked around. This is because I have never heard of Manticores forming groups, let alone a group of ten.</p>



<p>First of all, it was the first time I saw a Manticore around here. Manticores usually live deep within the forest, so why did they come out in a group? Perhaps someone stole their habitat. That’s what I thought.</p>



<p>But after about thirty minutes, I couldn’t find any clues, and eventually, my actions came to an end.</p>



<p>If I follow the footsteps of the Manticores and venture into the deepest part, I might find out something, but I’m not prepared for that.</p>



<p>For now, I had to convince myself to pay attention to movements in the forest.</p>



<p>When I returned to where I was, I was surprised to find the winged beast that I thought had already left was still there. Moreover, it was making a pained sound and thrashing on the ground.</p>



<p>It was as if it was fine before, but I realized something. The tails of the Manticores are extremely venomous. None of them managed to hit me with it, but the winged beast must have been stabbed by those tails many times.</p>



<p>It seemed that the poison was still spreading. I looked around, wondering what I should do.</p>



<p>Fortunately, there were the medicinal herbs I had collected. Some of them should work against the poison.</p>



<p>However, I don’t know if human medicinal herbs would work on winged beasts. Even if they do, considering the large size of the winged beast, it might not be enough even if I use everything I have.</p>



<p>First of all, will the poison of a Manticore be neutralized? If it can, and considering the size of the winged beast, I might not need all of it.</p>



<p>“For the poison… for the poison… somewhere… Ah, that’s right! There was a perfect effect that neutralized the paralysis poison of the Fly King!”</p>



<p>The Jiraiya Oaks. It’s not too far from here. If I run with all my strength using energy, I might be able to get back in less than an hour.</p>



<p>If I think calmly, I don’t have to go to such lengths for this winged beast, I could even cut it down right now.</p>



<p>However, when I remembered those eyes it gave me, I hesitated to do that.</p>



<p>Well, we were comrades that fought against the Manticores, but if it attacks me after it recovers from the poison, then I will devour it.</p>



<p>Seeing the winged beast suffering as it laid its long neck on the ground, and after contemplating for a moment, I started running at full speed.</p>



<p>— In conclusion, the Indigo-scaled Wyvern managed to survive.</p>



<p>When the Wyvern ate the fruit of the Jiraiya Oaks, it made a “Pugiiii” sound like a pig due to the sour taste, but soon after, the poison from the Manticores was neutralized, and it started fluttering with joy.</p>



<p>The Jiraiya Oaks is amazing. I thought so once again.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<p>Miroslav Sauzar hates men. If asked what the cause was, she would name her father without hesitation.</p>
<p>In her hometown, the Sauzar Company is one of the three largest companies in the Kingdom of Canaria, and Miroslav’s father built it in just one generation.</p>
<p>Her father, who brought a small clothing store in a corner of the capital, turned it into a major corporation in just 30 years, making him highly respected as a merchant.</p>
<p>However, as a father, he was a failure–no, he was the worst. At least, that’s how Miroslav sees it.</p>
<p>Her father always had women on both sides. Moreover, the women changed from one day to another. Just like his business, or rather, he was more energetic with women.</p>
<p>Miroslav is the seventh daughter of a mistress. Her mother was a dancer, and because her father loved her passionate dances and her fiery red hair, Miroslav was born.</p>
<p>Young Miroslav did not live in the main residence but in a less well-maintained villa. The surrounding residents called it the mistress’s house.</p>
<p>Miroslav does not remember talking to her father when she was young. While the children in the main residence wore colorful clothes, the clothing in the mistress’s house was very basic.</p>
<p>In the mansion, her mother and the other mistresses waited for her father, who had no idea when he would come, and took care of their skin and put on makeup.</p>
<p>In the eyes of young Miroslav, she saw that her mother and the others looked terrible. She couldn’t count how many times she wished she wasn’t like them.</p>
<p>That’s why she studied hard. Her goal was the Academy of Sages. That was Miroslav’s path to not become just an ordinary woman.</p>
<p>But even if she had the aspiration, the cost of the exam was not something a girl could afford. She had no choice but to rely on her father. Instead of begging, it was an investment.</p>
<p>If his daughter entered the Academy of Sages, the company’s stocks would also increase–thinking that, her father paid the cost of the exam. When she passed the academy’s exam, she shouted with satisfaction. That’s how Miroslav managed to escape the “Mistress’s House.”</p>
<p>However, despite the hardships she went through to enter the Academy of Sages, there was no rest for Miroslav. The first thing was her appearance. At that time, Miroslav had no interest in beauty.</p>
<p>What mattered to her was cleanliness. Even if her hair was in poor condition, even if her freckles were visible, even if she had dark circles from staying up all night studying, she didn’t attempt to use makeup.</p>
<p>Miroslav thought that such a thing should only be used by women trying to attract men. She also had an unknown fear of approaching her mother and the others with makeup.</p>
<p>Because of that, the looks from the opposite sex were disdainful, and she was shunned by the same sex. Nevertheless, Miroslav thought that was fine. No one would bother her, and she could concentrate on her studies as much as possible.</p>
<p>Indeed, Miroslav was excellent. Not only was she knowledgeable in magical knowledge and had magical skills that surpassed her seniors, but she also had a promising future.</p>
<p>Miroslav was proud of that fact and became even more committed to her studies. In other words, it could also be said that the wall between her and the surroundings grew thicker than before.</p>
<p>As a result, Miroslav’s attitude was perceived by others as “bold,” and from isolation, it turned into direct and indirect harassment.</p>
<p>It wasn’t limited to the opposite sex. Miroslav hated men, but that didn’t mean she was close to the same sex.</p>
<p>On the contrary, Miroslav looked down on girls her age who were enthusiastic about makeup and the opposite sex, despite having entered the academy.</p>
<p>Such feelings were related to nature and behavior. The few friends she had diminished, and continued to diminish. Eventually, Miroslav had no allies in the academy.</p>
<p>Such a situation couldn’t be pleasant, and the days of chronic discomfort continued. And a point of escape for Miroslav was the ecological research of a certain monster.</p>
<p>To the village she came to for that, called Melte. That village was the home of Lars and Iria. Lars, who was curious about the world outside the village, was amazed by Miroslav, who, despite her age, acted as a full-time researcher, so for various reasons, he followed her.</p>
<p>At first, Miroslav disliked it, but regardless of appearance and gender, Lars’s actions directly praised Miroslav, and she began to feel comfortable. At the end of the research, she realized she was clearly attracted to Lars.</p>
<p>She also knew that Lars longed to be an adventurer. There was extensive magical research at the Academy of Sages, and many became adventurers after leaving the academy.</p>





<p>However, that was a profession for the lower achievers. The outstanding ones obtained state jobs such as court mages or were sent to a magical institution. In fact, Miroslav had that path in mind.</p>
<p>Miroslav’s magical aptitude, especially in handling fire magic, was at a very promising level, and the academy’s superiors already had their eyes on her.</p>
<p>No matter how attracted she was to Lars, she had no desire to throw away a bright future for a boy younger than her. The connection between Miroslav and Lars was supposed to end as a temporary encounter.</p>
<p>But things suddenly changed. Originally, Miroslav, who was supposed to complete her course at the age of 15, was shortened by two years and finished it at the age of 13, expected to graduate as a prodigy.</p>
<p>However, on the day of the graduation exam, Miroslav didn’t show up. It was because she was locked in an old library in the basement of the dormitory.</p>
<p>Even if she tried to destroy the door using magic, she would be exposed to danger in a confined space. Besides, there was also the situation where she couldn’t damage the valuable books.</p>
<p>The criminal who confined Miroslav is still unknown. Later, she managed to escape on her own, then spoke about the situation and requested to take a new exam, but her request was not accepted.</p>
<p>It was an outcome considered a problem that the royal family, who came to see the prodigy, was wasted.</p>
<p>In this way, instead of Miroslav obtaining an honorable profession, she couldn’t graduate and was expelled from the academy due to inappropriate behavior.</p>
<p>From the beginning, Miroslav was isolated from her surroundings. Moreover, there was no one who could do anything that would incur the wrath of the royal family, so in the end, Miroslav went to the adventurer’s guild. And needless to say, she encountered Lars there.</p>
<p>However, Miroslav didn’t immediately go to Lars. It was because she didn’t want him to see her in such a fallen state.</p>
<p>There was no way she could say, “I was expelled from the academy for inappropriate behavior.”</p>
<p>She wanted him to know that she became an adventurer of her own accord, so she decided to make a name for herself. When she went to see Lars, it would be after she gained a reputation she wasn’t ashamed of.</p>
<p>…Due to that impatience, she was on the verge of suffering violent actions in the first group she joined, so it was no wonder she harbored great hatred towards men.</p>
<p>And now, she didn’t know how long, but she had been forced into a painful situation by the existence of a man. At first, she didn’t think of it that way.</p>
<p>The opponent was a level “1,” so she thought that if she got serious, she could resolve this matter.</p>
<p>But that thought vanished in a day. That person whom she had once ridiculed as a “parasite” and expelled from the group turned out to be incredibly strong.</p>
<p>Her strongest magic was neutralized as if it were nothing, her fastest magic was undone in an instant, and her trump card was interrupted in a humiliating manner.</p>
<p>Every time Sora kissed her, she felt that something precious within her was being absorbed and chewed on. There were countless times she thought she would die.</p>
<p>She tried to kill that man—no, that monster. It was something else in the form of a human.</p>
<p>It was evident from the fact that Sora, who should be a level “1,” perfectly neutralized Miroslav’s magic.</p>
<p>However, the monster in the form of Sora continued his actions, disregarding Miroslav’s resistance. She couldn’t escape, and the days of humiliation continued.</p>
<p>Every time their lips met, she felt nauseous, but her body experienced a strong pleasure and involuntarily heated up.</p>
<p>She also attempted to choose death. Sora wasn’t always close to Miroslav. Although he could prevent her from resisting or escaping, he couldn’t prevent her from committing suicide.</p>
<p>However, despite having that in mind, Miroslav didn’t do it. She was afraid to die, but it was also because she knew that Sora’s plan would still be possible even if she died.</p>
<p>Sora would use Miroslav as bait to lure Lars and the others deep into danger. Even if Miroslav died, Lars and the others who were unaware would come to her rescue.</p>
<p>Just when Lars came to rescue her, it would be unbearable for her to be seen in such a state—so that feeling deprived Miroslav of the option to commit suicide.</p>
<p>Unable to resist, escape, or take her own life, Miroslav gave up and allowed Sora to do as he pleased. To be more precise, she pretended to surrender.</p>
<p>No matter how much strength she used, Sora was a man. Just a greedy man. If she stopped resisting, he would think she had become submissive, and in that way, he would let his guard down. At least, that’s how men were until now.</p>
<p>In that way, she would make Sora drop his guard, and she would strike when Lars and the others arrived—that was Miroslav’s plan.</p>
<p>Deciding on that, Miroslav ceased her resistance and remained calm. Moreover, she couldn’t help but laugh at how Sora’s attitude softened.</p>

<p>It was a miscalculation for Miroslav, who was convinced that she would win if she held on until Lars and the others arrived, but that didn’t happen.</p>
<p>This was because Sora changed the original plan based on his new ability to devour souls, and of course, Miroslav didn’t know about it.</p>
<p>There was no way Miroslav herself could say, “Why are you setting a trap for Lars and the others all of a sudden?”</p>
<p>Those indecent acts repeated day after day, that time that seemed like it would never end. Every day, Miroslav’s mind and body were compressed, and her hidden limits were lost.</p>
<p>The anger within Miroslav was not directed solely at Sora, but also at the adventurer’s guild that hadn’t come to rescue her, and her companions from the “Falcon Sword.”</p>
<p>She didn’t doubt that Lars was searching for her, but what about Iria and Luna Maria?</p>
<p>This situation in which Miroslav was absent was a great opportunity for them to deepen their relationship with Lars—such suspicion clung to her chest and wouldn’t fade away.</p>
<p>If that was the case, the longer Miroslav was absent, the better for them. That suspicion eventually convinced her, and it quickly grew intense.</p>
<p>Normally, Miroslav wouldn’t have sharpened her emotions to such an extent, and she should have noticed the words that had struck her from Sora.</p>
<p>However, she was practically a prisoner forced to engage in indecent acts morning and night, which weakened her both physically and mentally. It was impossible to remain calm in this state.</p>
<p>Despite being the daughter of a mistress, Miroslav had grown up under the protection of the Sauzar company and didn’t know true poverty.</p>
<p>Being exposed to direct violence and malice, her mind and body were more vulnerable than expected.</p>
<p>After seeing Miroslav’s vulnerability, Sora attempted to break the last barrier he hadn’t touched before, and if she didn’t like it, he would tell her to follow his plan.</p>
<p>If Miroslav followed his plan, she would betray her companions. But if she didn’t, she would surely lose everything and meet a cruel end. Sora whispered in Miroslav’s ear.</p>
<p>“You won’t betray your companions, but you will simply exact deserved revenge on Iria and Luna Maria for abandoning you. If you cooperate with me, I promise to leave you and Lars alone in the future. If you don’t cooperate, I’ll take everything from you and kill Lars and the others. In other words, Lars’s life is in your hands—”</p>
<p>Those words that manipulated her mind and body, clouded her consciousness, and made her believe that betrayal was the best option, for Miroslav, it was like the whisper of a demon…</p>
<p>Ten days later, the figure of Miroslav Sauzar appeared in Ishka. It had been approximately a month since she disappeared.</p>
<p>The guild staff and the adventurers who had continued their search activities, especially the members of the “Falcon Sword,” were completely surprised by Miroslav’s appearance.</p>
<p>Then, they noticed that Miroslav’s long red hair, of which she was proud, had been cut to shoulder-length. And also, her one-month absence.</p>
<p>When they asked what happened, she shrugged and sadly lowered her head.</p>
<p>And she said, “I’m not agreeing the guild’s arrest, so I disappeared in protest.”</p>
<p>The guild staff who heard this turned red-faced and shocked. It was only natural. Addressing those people, Miroslav knelt down and apologized. “My head cleared while I was alone.”</p>
<p>She was willing to accept any punishment—but with those words, the place fell silent.</p>
<p>Afterward, Miroslav was taken to the guild and questioned, but in any case, the situation was resolved. The arrangement for Sora to be secretly pursued as a suspect was also canceled.</p>
<p>Another ten days passed, and Sora returned to Ishka. At that time, Sora acquired a new slave.</p>
<p>At this point, only two people, including Sora, knew that this slave would be a new pawn.</p>
