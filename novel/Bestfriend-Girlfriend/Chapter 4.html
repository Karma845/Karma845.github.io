<h1>Chapter 4: The Transformation of Takata Takaka</h1>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“How&#8217;s Takata  doing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After Masaki-chan and Kayama-san left. I was alone with Lili that I asked her that question.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Right now, I&#8217;ve stripped her naked and pinned her soul back on, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And&#8230;she&#8217;s had a change in appearance too, devi. Used the tanning machine to get a full-body tan. Dyed her hair a light ash grey too, devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Haha, she&#8217;ll be really surprised. I can&#8217;t even imagine what kind of expression that serious Takata-san would have when she sees herself like that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“To gradually adapt and train. Changing her 『home』. This time we tried training her outside the room,Devi .”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“By outside, do you mean letting her go!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Even I am surprised by this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“We won&#8217;t release her, Devi. We&#8217;ll place them in a completely different environment, but with 『Quiet』 imposed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But what if they manage to escape?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“That&#8217;s why the first thing FumiFumi should do is grasp her weaknesses, Devi. Find out things that would be really bad if exposed, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Weaknesses?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“With a muzzle of 『Quiet』 grasp their weaknesses, and put a collar on them so they can&#8217;t escape, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But how do I investigate that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s simple, Devi. Just ask the person herself. Through 『Monologue』.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;So, specifically, what kind of training will I do?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, open up your ears and listen closely, Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After receiving an explanation of the training content from Lili, I stepped into the room where Takata-san was being held captive.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The dimly lit room with ambient lighting. At the back, lying down, was a girl with ash-grey hair and a sun-kissed complexion resembling the colour of dark-roasted coffee.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“People can change when circumstances change. She looks completely different now, not a trace of her former self”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-5' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<div data-fuse="22386378222"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I said aloud while gazing at her figure from a distance, and Lili whispered in my ear.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Then let&#8217;s begin, Devi. When the lights go out, pull the pin, Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Got it.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After the lights went out, a voice that sounded like a moan, [Uhh&#8230; uhn] could be heard from the depths of the room. It seemed that Takata-san had woken up.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">However, in this darkness, it shouldn&#8217;t be easy for her to notice the change in her appearance so readily.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What&#8230; It&#8217;s pitch black, what is this?&#8221;”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In her bewildered voice, I found myself feeling slightly amused.</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey there, Takata-san.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Kijima Fumio? You! What did you do to me?! Where am I? Do you think you can get away with this?!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Such an unremarkable reaction. It&#8217;s like a template.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone reacts the same way in situations like this.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Everyone? Could it be…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Yes, I&#8217;m the culprit behind the mass kidnapping case. In other words, Takata-san, unknowingly, stepped on a huge landmine.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, from the darkness, I heard a sharp intake of breath.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Well then&#8230; Let&#8217;s set the trap right away.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I activated the 『Monologue』 and spoke.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, Takata-san isn&#8217;t exactly my type, so I could consider letting you go. But you have weaknesses that leave you with no choice but to obey me…!”</span></p>

</div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As soon as I said that, Takata-san&#8217;s inner voice echoed in my mind.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">《Weakness? Could it be&#8230; You found out about me dating Kobayashi-san?》</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oi,oi,oi&#8230;Seriously?! A massive bombshell just came out of nowhere!’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">I really hadn&#8217;t imagined this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Kobayashi-sensei is the faculty advisor for the disciplinary committee. A young teacher in their second year of assignment. Moreover, a recent parent and a married individual. If this is true, it&#8217;s not a situation that can be resolved with just a reprimand.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Let&#8217;s dig a bit deeper&#8230;&#8217;</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Teachers shouldn&#8217;t get involved with students, right, Takata-san?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“W-what are you talking about?”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-8' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">《It’s fine! It&#8217;s pure love between us!! He promised he would divorce his wife, and we&#8217;ll get married right after you graduate&#8230; There&#8217;s really no problem at all.》</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Oi,oi&#8230;seriously. Why would she believe something like that…’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">No matter how you look at it, it&#8217;s a marriage fraud scheme. I was honestly amazed by this.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“For someone who&#8217;s the head of the disciplinary committee, aren&#8217;t you ashamed of deceiving a married teacher?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t say such slanderous things!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">《Ours is a pure love! It was a fateful encounter!》</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘Personal romantic relationships are considered impure when involving interactions with the opposite s*x, yet this person regards their own affair as pure love&#8230;quite remarkable, this individual.’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It carries a negative connotation, doesn&#8217;t it? Well, perhaps you believe that your feelings are rooted in pure love, but&#8230; here&#8217;s the thing, the public doesn&#8217;t share that perspective. Once this comes to light, Kobayashi-sensei will be dismissed as nothing more than a morally compromised teacher and his reputation will be socially destroyed.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">After a weighty silence, the voice of Takata-san, sounding like a whimper, could be heard.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Uuu&#8230;Please, I apologise. I won&#8217;t reveal anything about you either&#8230;please, spare us. What do I need to do to keep quiet about us?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Money.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“H-How much do I need to pay&#8230;?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Three million yen.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“T-That&#8217;s impossible!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Don&#8217;t worry, I&#8217;ll arrange a job for you. It&#8217;s at a girls&#8217; bar, but it&#8217;s not the kind of place where you have to do anything explicit. If you can earn three million yen there over the summer break, I&#8217;ll set you free without any trouble, and I&#8217;ll also keep your relationship with Kobayashi-sensei a secret.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-10' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">The plan that was explained in advance by Lili is as follows.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili&#8217;s followers completely took over a girls&#8217; bar overnight, both physically and legally. The idea is to have a large number of gals there and she intends to put Takaya-san to work alongside them.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Why would something like this happen again…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Isn&#8217;t it a unique situation, the stern student council president falling amidst indecent gals? Isn&#8217;t that quite a dramatic twist,Devi?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well&#8230; it&#8217;s definitely exciting, but…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Women, as creatures, are highly empathetic beings, you see. They&#8217;re much more prone to adapting to their environment, and just like when white mixes with red to create pink, if she’s with gals, she will tend to become a gal herself,Devi.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-11' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_9 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Lili says proudly.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Just that?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Not exactly. That&#8217;s just the foundation. It&#8217;s a place where customers come with the purpose of enjoying time with gals. Under the value system that deems gals more capable if they are [gal-like], those with poor grades are scolded and reprimanded as per your wishes,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I see&#8230;but even if everything goes well and her 『home』becomes a place of crude black gals, it seems like there won&#8217;t be any connection with me at all. From my perspective, it doesn&#8217;t seem very enjoyable.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">With that, Lili smiles mischievously.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“As I explained earlier, the training method for this time is about making her earn the target amount of money. It&#8217;s impossible to achieve that amount through regular means,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, three million yen in one month…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And so! We&#8217;ll dangle a spider&#8217;s thread right in front of her,Devi.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-12' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_10 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Are we offering her a lifeline?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Exactly. Specifically, I&#8217;ll assign a value to having s*x with FumiFumi. If she agrees, I&#8217;ll subtract that amount from the target,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“But that&#8217;s not like forcing her, right? I can&#8217;t imagine anyone going along with that.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">At this point, Lili raises her index finger and wags it from side to side while making a clicking sound with her tongue. Yeah, it&#8217;s annoying.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Misleading people is actually quite easy, you know. FumiFumi, making someone deviate from the path is a piece of cake,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What do you mean?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“In academic terms, deviating from the path is called 『deviant behaviour』 and there&#8217;s a formula for the pressure required to make someone engage in that deviant behaviour,Devi.”</span></p>
<div class='code-block code-block-13' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- 71161633/article_incontent_6/article_incontent_11 -->
<div data-fuse="22432772359"></div></div>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A formula? Is that a real thing?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Devi,Devi. Listen closely and open your ears,Devi!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And then, Lili pointed her finger right at the tip of my nose.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The 『pressure towards deviant behaviour is proportional to the high feasibility and strong desire.』 Do you get it?,Devi&#8221;</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“I don&#8217;t really understand at all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“It&#8217;s simple when I give you an example. Let&#8217;s say there&#8217;s a very delicious-looking bread being sold, and let&#8217;s consider the person&#8217;s state upon seeing it as either (A) having a meal waiting at home or (B) being on the brink of starving. Clearly, in scenario (B), the desire for the bread is stronger,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well, that makes sense. They&#8217;re practically starving, after all.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Now, let&#8217;s consider the state of the bakery, (1) The bread is kept in a glass case at the storefront, with a clerk present. (2) The bread is casually stacked in a basket on the counter, with no clerk nearby,Devi.”</span></p><div class='code-block code-block-14' style='margin: 8px auto; text-align: center; display: block; clear: both;'>
<!-- videoads_12 -->
<script type="text/javascript" src="https://publift.bbvms.com/a/travistranslations_outstream.js"></script></div>


<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Okay.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“The person in scenario (A) has a lower level of desire, so the pressure won&#8217;t push them to steal the bread no matter what. The person in scenario (B) has a high desire level, but in case (1), the feasibility is low, making them less likely to act. However, when the person in scenario (B) encounters situation (2) &#8211; in other words, when a person with a high desire level encounters a situation with high feasibility &#8211; deviant behaviour, in this case, stealing, the pressure towards it becomes extremely high,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“So, we’re pushing Takata-san into scenario (B) × (2)?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hehe, that&#8217;s right! That&#8217;s the idea! I&#8217;m excited to see it. Having the strict student council president feel guilt while willingly resorting to selling her body for money,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Oh, that&#8217;s intense…”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“And what&#8217;s more, once someone deviates from the path, their psychological barriers lower. Plus, with the accumulation of experience, the feasibility of such actions increases. So, the pressure towards deviant behaviour becomes even stronger. The concept that criminals are more likely to commit repeat offences, well, that&#8217;s essentially what it means.,Devi.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">×××</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Well then, Takata-san. We&#8217;ll assign a maid to you, so you can ask her about the details.”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“A maid?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">As I tilted my head in confusion, almost simultaneously, a sound of a door opening from the darkness followed by its closing resonated.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Hey, wait a minute! W-Wait!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In my haste, my outstretched fingers encountered nothing and only my voice reverberated off the walls.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">And as that reverberation faded, in its place lingered a silence that felt almost oppressive.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘What the heck is this? What did I even do? I was just trying to fulfil my duties as the student council president. Why am I in this situation?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">My mind was a mess, and the word 『confusion』 didn&#8217;t seem enough to describe it.</span></p>

<p><i><span style="font-weight: 400">‘By the way&#8230;Is that guy the perpetrator of the group kidnapping incident? How did he find out about my secret affair with Kobayashi-sensei? Working at a girls&#8217; bar? Me? Earn three million yen&#8230; Can I really do something like that?’</span></i></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“What on earth&#8230; What&#8217;s happening here! Seriously!”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">While tearing at my hair, I plopped down on the spot. Almost immediately, the room suddenly brightened.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">In that instant, I noticed my attire and let out a scream.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">“Eek!? I-I&#8217;m naked? W-What is this? This skin colour! What&#8217;s going on!?”</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Completely stark naked. Furthermore, my skin was a deep brown, almost like a dark roast coffee, so different from my own skin colour.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Suddenly, the door swung open, and a girl entered the room.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-weight: 400">Short hair with a white primrose. She was wearing a short maid outfit,and her face had a somewhat cheeky expression.</span></p>
