<h1>Chapter 4: Gal and Cooking</h1>


<p>“Danger, I’m so hungry… I feel like I’m going to die…”</p>

<p>On a certain Thursday during lunch break, I visited the school library alone.</p>
<p>I walked between the bookshelves like a sleepwalker, feeling dizzy.</p>
<p>By the way, the reason I ended up like this is quite simple— I usually receive 2500 yen from my mother as a week’s worth of food money, but this week, I spent it on a new light novel, leaving me with no money to buy lunch.</p>

<p>“Currently, it’s 12:50 PM… Since we have an early dinner at home and I can eat dinner at around 6:30 PM, let’s see… Five hours and forty minutes left… Five hours and forty minutes!?”</p>

<p>As I shuddered at the fact that there was still quite a bit of time left, my stomach let out a loud growl.</p>
<p>While I don’t regret my decision, I couldn’t help but feel anxious about my stomach growling during class.</p>

<p>As I roamed around the library with these thoughts, I heard a faint chuckle from somewhere, so I directed my gaze toward the source of the sound.</p>
<p>And there, sitting at a corner of a square table, reading a book with ‘Light Novel Club’ written on its cover, was Tsumakawa-san.</p>
<p>There is a gal reading a novel in the library during her lunch break. Is she really a gal?</p>

<p>Thinking this, I observed Tsumakawa from a distance.</p>
<p>‘Hehe… hehehe…’ While reading the light novel, Tsumakawa-san couldn’t hold back her laughter.</p>
<p>I get it, I totally get it. When you come across an enjoyable story, your face naturally lights up, right?</p>

<p>“Hehe…”</p>

<p>Feeling empathetic towards her, I couldn’t help but smile.</p>
<p>But wait, isn’t it too creepy for me to be smiling while watching Tsumakawa-san read her light novel with a grin on her face?</p>
<p>While I was observing Tsumakawa-san, who seemed to be having a great time reading, suddenly, she noticed my gaze.</p>

<p>She lifted her head and then started fidgeting around.</p>
<p>Before I knew it, Tsumakawa, upon noticing my presence, exclaimed, ‘Hey!’</p>
<p>She put away the light novel she was holding in her bag and rushed over to me with her bag in tow.</p>

<p>“Wow, it’s Nezumayo! Yahoo——What are you up to?”</p>
<p>“W-Well, I’m not doing anything… I just had some free time, so I was just wandering around here…”</p>
<p>“Wandering around the school aimlessly, aren’t you acting like an old man?”</p>

<p>After teasing me like that, Tsumakawa smiled innocently.</p>
<p>While I was thinking about how she’s so easygoing with even someone like me, even though I hadn’t asked anything, she started talking on her own.</p>

<p>“By the way, I came to the library to borrow an interesting book. And then, I stumbled upon this ‘Light Novel Club’ story… Hehe, I got so absorbed in reading it! Light novels are so entertaining!”</p>
<p>“I see… that’s seems good—cough, cough…”</p>
<p>“…Hey, Nezumayo, are you okay? What’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“Huh? No… I’m not feeling bad or anything… I’m fine——cough, cough…”</p>
<p>“Wait, seriously, what’s wrong? You look paler than usual, and you seem weak! Are you eating properly?”</p>
<p>“Ah, of course… Just a while ago, I had about 400cc of tap water…”</p>
<p>“That’s not a meal…what? Is it because you’re hungry? Wait a second!”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa-san said to me and then lowered her school bag from her shoulder to the floor.</p>
<p>She rummaged through the contents of her bag and exclaimed, ‘Ah, found it!’.</p>
<p>Then, in a tone similar to that of a certain well-known character she pulled something out and said:</p>

<p>“Ta-daa♪. Pocky Ultra Slim♪”</p>
<p>“Cut it out with the needlessly high-quality voice imitation. I can see the effort you’ve put into practicing.”</p>

<p>Having done that, she seemed to have taken out what looked like a box of snacks— Tsumakawa opened it and handed me one of the two bags.</p>
<p>Huh… Could it be?</p>

<p>“Th-This, you’re giving it to me?”</p>
<p>“Yeah. You’re hungry, right? Eat it!”</p>
<p>“B-but, I can’t pay for it…”</p>
<p>“In a situation like this, there’s no way I’d take money from you. Don’t underestimate Miona too much, okay?”</p>

<p>Saying that, Tsumakawa gently squeezed my shoulder with her fist.</p>
<p>Feeling touched, I stared at her directly.</p>
<p>——The white gal who had blessed me with a box of pocky with a beaming smile looked like a goddess to me now.</p>

<p>“…Could it be that Tsumakawa-san is the kind of gal we otaku have dreamed about——Are you an otaku-friendly gal?”</p>
<p>“Hahaha, don’t get ahead of yourself. It’s not like all gals are kind to otaku, it’s just that I’m a gal who’s kind to otaku. Don’t get carried away, okay?”</p>

<p>After receiving the bag of snacks from her with those words, I tore it open with trembling hands.</p>
<p>Without hesitation, I put an ultra-slim snack stick into my mouth… and I couldn’t help but exclaim.</p>

<p>“Wowww! Delicious!”</p>
<p>“You’re really overflowing with simple impressions.”</p>

<p>And so, for about a dozen seconds, I voraciously consumed the snacks Tsumakawa gave me.</p>
<p>While savoring the chocolate’s sweetness and the fermented-butter pretzel’s crunchiness, I quickly devoured them.</p>
<p>After finishing them in an instant, I deeply bowed my head to her and expressed my gratitude.</p>

<p>“Seriously, thank you so much, Tsumakawa-san… I was incredibly hungry, so this helped me out a lot! I’ll never forget this kindness!”</p>
<p>“Hey, you’re really grateful. Just how hungry were you?”</p>
<p>“Well, the thing is, I’m really tight on money… I was in such a tight spot that I couldn’t even afford a single piece of bread for lunch. So, receiving solid food from Tsumakawa-san is genuinely appreciated… Thank you!”</p>
<p>“Don’t call the sweets someone gave you a ‘solid food.’ Anyway, Nezumayo, are you really that short on money? If that’s the case, how about this: should I make you a bento for tomorrow?”</p>
<p>“Huh…?”</p>

<p>Once again, I was taken aback by Tsumakawa’s statement.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Tsumakawa gazed at me with a genuinely cheerful expression.</p>

<p>…A homemade bento from Tsumakawa?</p>
<p>Well, for someone like me who doesn’t have plans to prepare lunch again tomorrow, it’s an unexpectedly good offer…</p>


<p>While I was hesitating in various ways, she continued with a bright voice.</p>

<p>“You know, I’ve been getting into cooking lately. So, if you can eat it, it might be a good opportunity for me. It’s not so motivating to cook just for myself, you know? I want to cook for someone else! ——hey, of course you’ll eat my bento, right?”</p>
<p>“Having you go to such lengths is a bit…”</p>
<p>“But, Nezumayo-kun, you don’t have money now, right? What about tomorrow’s lunch? More tap water? Aren’t you going to die soon?”</p>
<p>“No-no, there’s no way I’m going to die… cough cough”</p>
<p>“You don’t think I’m joking, do you?—Go ahead and be spoiled by me from the get-go. Why not let yourself be pampered by Miona, a gal with a motherly vibe!”</p>

<p>While patting her chest, Tsumakawa said that.</p>
<p>Honestly, her frankness towards me or rather, her friendliness, was starting to become quite bewildering for me.</p>
<p>With those thoughts in mind, I turned to her again and, despite my hesitation, spoke.</p>

<p>“…No, Tsumakawa-san. I think I’ll decline the bento offer…”</p>
<p>“Huh? Why? Even though I straight up told you I’d make it for you? Huh?”</p>
<p>“Hey, could you not get all annoyed like some delinquent? …Because, you know, there’s no reason for you to be so nice to me. It’s not like we’re in that kind of relationship, Tsumakawa and I. And yet, having you make a bento for me… I just don’t know how I should take it.”</p>
<p>“…Huh?”</p>

<p>In response to my words, Tsumakawa made a face as if to say, ‘What are you talking about?’</p>
<p>Taking her reaction into account, I repeated my words to accurately convey the emotions I was experiencing.</p>

<p>“I don’t really know why Tsumakawa-san would make a bento for me…I don’t know if it’s a volunteering spirit or if there’s some ulterior motive, but it’s scary, or rather, I feel uncomfortable… “</p>
<p>“Uncomfortable!? Even though I’m giving you a homemade bento? Aren’t you too cheeky?”</p>
<p>“But, it’s actually like that… Lately, you know, Tsumakawa-san has been talking to me a lot. Each time you do, I’m left wondering, ‘Why?’ And like, you even blessed me with a good snack earlier. Personally, I really appreciated it, but deep down, there’s still that question of ‘Why?’ — Anyway, right now, I’m bewildered being approached by you, a gal.”</p>
<p>“…Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Yeah… but, because the one doing the approaching is Minacho-san, I don’t really dislike it to that extent… well, the fact that I don’t dislike it, in itself, makes me feel conflicted as an otaku——but in any case, I’m just utterly confused by being approached so strongly by this cheerful gal. That’s why, when you said you would make me a bento, I honestly felt happy about it, but I can’t accept it straightforwardly… and I feel like I shouldn’t accept it, that’s my true feeling——”</p>
<p>“Hehe——you’re getting all tangled up.”</p>

<p>As I poured out my feelings, Tsumakawa cut me off with that remark and playfully punched my chest.</p>
<p>…I feel like I’m saying too many unnecessary things right now!</p>

<p>While I was feeling flustered about that, she laughed cheerfully and continued.</p>

<p>“Aren’t you a bit too serious, Nezumayo? Take it easy. How about just thinking, ‘…I’ve been hanging around with gals lately. Gals are cute, I really like gals.’ In a relaxed way?”</p>
<p>“Uh, aren’t you casually trying to manipulate my impression?”</p>
<p>“You’re overthinking each of my actions, looking for reasons or causes. —I mean, I’m not a very smart girl, am I?”</p>
<p>“Well, saying that makes you not a smart girl anymore”</p>
<p>“Ahaha. But seriously, it’s true. Earlier, you were saying you’re scared because you don’t know why I’m making you a bento, but didn’t I mention something like that before? Like——simply because I want to get along with Nezumayo, obviously.”</p>
<p>” …… “</p>
<p>“Don’t be too overwhelmed by the third dimension, otaku-kun. Sure, the idea that every gal is nice to Otakus is an illusion—but for that reason alone, Miona will be nice to you. Because you’re the only one for whom such a reason exists. You’re just scared of being treated kindly by me, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>…To those straightforward words filled with goodwill, I widened my eyes. The uneasiness I had towards Tsumakawa was gradually unraveling just a little bit.</p>
<p>Even though I thought gals were an existence beyond my understanding, I see… she’s treating me well because she’s following her own selfish feelings.</p>
<p>Of course, I still hadn’t figured out why she would want to befriend someone like me, but at least now that I knew why she was being kind to me, I felt a bit relieved.</p>

<p>“So, what about the homemade lunch by Miona? Are you really going to refuse?”</p>
<p>” ….. “</p>

<p>As a self-conscious otaku, it might be the right thing to refuse.</p>
<p>However, now that I understood that the kindness she was offering had nothing I couldn’t comprehend—if that was the case—my petty desire to experience a cultural meal overwhelmed me.</p>
<p>So, I said to her,</p>

<p>“It’s quite cheeky of me, but could I ask for it?”</p>
<p>“Heheh, of course leave it to me! I’ll make an awesome bento that looks like it’s ready for a festival and tastes out of this world!”</p>
<p>“It would be great if you didn’t put any weird substances in it!”</p>

<p>When I thought about it calmly, could I really eat a bento made by a girl from the third dimension?</p>
<p>I was acting stubborn like a typical otaku, refusing to eat it.</p>
<p>But in the end… I’m basically saying, ‘Could you make me a bento, please?’—In this debate, I was completely defeated by this gal…?</p>
<p>Just as I started realizing this terrifying fact, Tsumakawa suddenly took out her smartphone from her school bag.</p>

<p>“By the way, there’s a video that inspired me to want to cook. Wanna watch it?”</p>
<p>“…Come to think of it, you said you’ve been getting into cooking recently… Did you watch some videos and get inspired to start cooking?”</p>
<p>“Nah, it’s not like that… for now, let’s watch this video together!”</p>

<p>Without even asking if I wanted to watch it, Tsumakawa took my hand and pulled me closer, our bodies pressing together.</p>
<p>Then, with our cheeks almost touching, we peered into the phone’s screen… Wait, isn’t this way too close!?</p>
<p>No, what, the distance is clearly too close! And there’s some strange, nice smell… Isn’t this gal a bit too inconsiderate toward an introverted guy!?</p>

<p>While thinking that inwardly, I still felt that since I was going to have her make a bento for me tomorrow, I should endure and watch a cooking video or two.</p>
<p>Thus, I focused on the video playing on the smartphone that Tsumakawa had started with a lower volume. And then, there it was…</p>

<p>『Here we are! It’s Nacho’s Homemade Cooking time! Yay!』</p>

<p>On the screen…I saw Tsumakawa-san dressed in a ponytail and a cat-patterned apron, standing in a kitchen set in a house studio.</p>

<p>“Um… Tsumakawa-san, what’s this…?”</p>
<p>“Hehehe. This is my modeling magazine 『leg』’s official YouTube channel! Look, don’t I look cute? Doesn’t it give off an energetic vibe?”</p>
<p>“It’s quite something to watch a video of yourself and say ‘Doesn’t it give off an energetic vibe?’—your self-praise and wordplay are impressive…”</p>
<p>“Anyway, watch it properly! This video is seriously hilarious! You’ll definitely burst into laughter and die laughing!”</p>
<p>“Maybe it’s better not to set the bar too high for yourself?”</p>

<p>As I retorted like that, I looked at her in the smartphone screen.</p>
<p>The video titled ‘A Gal Tried Making Nikujaga!’ seemed to be about whether ‘leg’ exclusive models could cook without following recipes.</p>
<p>In this video, Tsumakawa was given the mission to make nikujaga (a Japanese meat and potato stew) within an hour without relying on her smartphone or any other resources.</p>


<p>『Wow! There are so many ingredients! Even though they’re expensive, you even prepared crabs and stuff! Can I put a crab in nikujaga?』</p>

<p>As she said that, Tsumakawa held a red king crab in her arms.</p>
<p>Then she moved her crab’s pincers and cracked a pun, saying ‘Crab Mania (かに道楽)’,</p>
<p>However, a caption appeared saying 《Boring WWww》 and criticized the joke.</p>
<p>(TN: wwwww, It is short for the Japanese word for “laugh” 笑う = warau, whose sound starts with a w. Sometimes people write 笑 instead of w, but the letter w is much faster to type on some keyboards. wwwww = hahahahaha )</p>

<p>“Isn’t that text a bit harsh? It might be true that it’s not funny, but it’s a bit pitiful to put what everyone’s thinking into text…”</p>
<p>“Hey, isn’t what Nezumayo is saying harsh too?”</p>

<p>Ignoring Tsumakawa’s comment, I see that she found a certain ingredient in the next scene of the video.</p>
<p>For some reason, she raised her excitement and brought it to the cutting board.</p>

<p>『Pineapple! Won’t it definitely become delicious if we add it?』</p>
<p>“Come on, this isn’t sweet and sour pork! And even in sweet and sour pork, you don’t use pineapple. What kind of daring move is adding pineapple to nikujaga…”</p>
<p>“Ahaha! This girl is really bad. She can’t cook at all.”</p>
<p>“What’s your position to be saying that? The girl trying to cut pineapple and the girl sitting right next to me is the same.”</p>

<p>As I retorted like that, I continued watching Tsumakawa’s cooking video together with her.</p>
<p>…First of all, she’s cooking with incredibly long nails.</p>

<p>I mean, there’s no way she can cut a pineapple with those nails. Just as I thought that—predictably.</p>
<p>With the words ‘Ouch!’ Tsumakawa accidentally injured her finger on a pineapple thorn.</p>

<p>『Aww, this is the worst… Seriously, this can’t be happening… Huh? Gross… evil pineapple…』</p>

<p>After that, the screen went dark, and a title card appeared: ‘Five Minutes Later~’</p>

<p>『Okay… Let’s start over and make the nikujaga… I mean, I don’t really like nikujaga, but my manager told me to do it, so I’ll do it. It’s my job, you know.』</p>
<p>“You’re obviously unhappy not because you don’t like nikujaga but because you’re injured!”</p>
<p>“I seriously won’t ever try to peel pineapple skin again. Pineapple is unforgivable!”</p>
<p>“Who would’ve thought that even Pineapple-kun would come to be hated by gals just because it has thorns?”</p>

<p>After that, Tsumakawa, who had become a bit grumpy, refocused on the main cooking process.</p>
<p>Giving up on the pineapple, she chose carrots, thinly sliced beef, and onions as the ingredients for nikujaga.</p>
<p>As she picked up the crucial potatoes, she brightened up a bit and proudly opened her mouth.</p>

<p>『Is this potato a Danshaku or a May Queen? I’m pretty sure May Queen is better suited for Nikujaga because it’s less likely to fall apart when cooked. ——By the way, Miona has this kind of knowledge thanks to her mom’s teachings. Hehe (smug face).”—』</p>
<p>(TN: Potato variety in Japan.)</p>
<p>“What’s that woman who lost to pineapple saying… “</p>
<p>“I didn’t lose! It’s a strategic retreat!”</p>
<p>“If she retreats and doesn’t fight again, then she loses, right?”</p>

<p>While exchanging such conversations, we observed the cheerful gal cooking together.</p>
<p>Eventually, after finishing washing the vegetables, Tsumakawa peeled them and began cutting them into bite-sized pieces.</p>

<p>“Oh? You’re handling these steps pretty smoothly.”</p>
<p>“Ehehe. Can you praise me more?”</p>
<p>“Well, the cut vegetables look quite uneven… The shapes are all over the place, so they won’t be cooked evenly.”</p>
<p>“Don’t joke around, give me more praise.”</p>

<p>While we were at it, the cooking progressed to the final stage of seasoning.</p>
<p>So far, Tsumakawa had been cooking the cut vegetables and meat in a pot without doing anything about the seasoning.</p>
<p>Then, she turned her attention to the table with various seasonings.</p>
<p>After observing what was there, she picked up a few of them and tilted her head with a bright expression.</p>

<p>『Shōyu… sugar… and mirin? What do you use mirin for? Isn’t it unnecessary? ——Oh, miso? Miso sounds good, right? Should I put it in?』</p>
<p>“Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid! Stop with the miso! Reconsider using miso! I’ve already given up on you not using Mirin! For now, just put down that huge container of miso you’re holding!”</p>
<p>『Do we not need a secret ingredient? ——Ah! How about adding some pink Monster Energy?』</p>
<p>“Don’t do unnecessary things, you stupid!”</p>
<p>“Ahahaha! This is seriously funny! You’re really good at reacting to things!”</p>

<p>As I retorted while tapping her smartphone, Tsumakawa laughed.</p>
<p>…She’s laughing like it’s someone else’s business, it’s you in the past who is in this video!</p>

<p>Anyway, from there, the video went as I expected—Tsumakawa added soy sauce and sugar, and in the end, she threw a dollop of miso into the pot.</p>
<p>After that, she finally tasted the completed dish and seemed to realize something.</p>

<p>『…Hmm, well, it’s good. The taste is pretty good… Oh, I see. It’s that kind of vibe? Right.』</p>

<p>And so, with the dish now plated in a bowl, she held it in her hands and showed it to everyone watching the video.</p>
<p>With a cute smile, she said:</p>

<p>『There you have it!—It’s Tsumakawa’s unique miso soup!』</p>
<p>“You’re cooking nikujaga, not miso soup!”</p>

<p>As soon as I said that, the gal beside me burst into laughter while clutching her stomach.</p>
<p>Well, she’s laughing a lot, but I’m talking to you, okay?</p>
<p>The video was titled ‘A Gal Tried Making Nikujaga!’ but it’s actually a sort of false advertising?!</p>

<p>After that unexpected twist, the video ended.</p>
<p>At the end, Tsumakawa said, ‘Don’t forget to subscribe to the channel,’ but before asking for that, she should probably apologize to the viewer.</p>

<p>“Haa, haaah… That was a tiring video to watch… There were so many parts I wanted to retort to in that video…”</p>
<p>“Hehe. But it was entertaining, wasn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, uh-huh… Tsumakawa’s actions were unpredictable, so I didn’t get bored…”</p>
<p>“Yay! I also had fun watching Nezumayo’s reactions! Let’s watch another video with me in it next time!”</p>

<p>Tsumakawa said that with a cheerful smile, but honestly, I felt like I should take a break from watching for a while.</p>
<p>Can’t you spare me from expending energy when I’m low on cash and nutrition?</p>
<p>While thinking this, I turned my attention back to Tsumakawa and continued, looking into her eyes.</p>

<p>“By the way, changing the topic a bit, Tsumakawa. You mentioned that you’d make a bento for me tomorrow, but you know, it’s fine not to do that… Just your intention means a lot to me, thank you for your kindness!”</p>
<p>“Well, actually, the topic hasn’t really changed, has it? After watching the video, you don’t want to eat my homemade dishes anymore?”</p>
<p>“N-no that’s not it!”</p>
<p>“You’re lying! I was going to make something for Yoda since I learned about the fun of cooking during this filming… but you don’t want to try my miso soup?”</p>
<p>“You’re planning to make miso soup? If you’re going to make miso soup next time, wouldn’t you end up making Nikujaga or something..?”</p>
<p>“Anyway, I’ll make a bento for you tomorrow, so make sure to eat it properly!”</p>
<p>“Please spare me, I’ll pay you.”</p>
<p>“You’re so broke but you still don’t want to eat it even if you have to pay me, how extreme!”</p>

<p>Saying that, Tsumakawa gave my shoulder a strong pat.</p>
<p>Seriously, spare me, please.</p>

<p>By the way, this is a minor twist, but on the next day, the bento that Tsumakawa made for me wasn’t the questionable concoction I had feared but was actually pretty good…</p>
<p>She said something like, ‘This is what I can make when I properly follow the recipe!’</p>
<p>Oddly enough, on the white rice portion, the word ‘Really tasty’ was written in seaweed and the bento was filled with brown side dishes that boys love.</p>
<p>I ate it while shedding tears and muttering, just like that Gin character from One Piece.</p>

<p>Gosh, I was way too hungry.</p>
