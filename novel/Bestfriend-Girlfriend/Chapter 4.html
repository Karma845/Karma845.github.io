<h1>Interlude 4: Without You</h1>

<p class="calibre4">『To summarize, ‘It turns out that my next-door neighbor is my student, and after living for nearly a month with meals being prepared for me, I was starting to not mind being with him. But then I freaked out and rejected him after seeing a new side of him I didn’t expect!’ Are you a demon? That’s too cruel! Poor guy.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">The night Yuunagi-kun left, I couldn’t keep it to myself and ended up spilling everything to my best friend over the phone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Don’t summarize it so bluntly.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Don’t whine! The one who’s probably about to cry is that neighbor boy!』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ugh…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Her harsh words made me involuntarily glance at the wall that borders the room next door.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Ah~ There’s so much to critique here, I don’t even know where to start. Give me back the excitement I felt when Reiyu-chan first came to me for love advice.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I heard a deep sigh over the phone.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s not like it’s a love advice! It’s just a neighborhood issue.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『You know, when a man and a woman meet, there’s always the potential for romance! Those insignificant days can turn into the beginning of a relationship when you look back later. In other words, everything is love advice!』</p>

<p class="calibre4">She argued more strongly than usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Love advice…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I wonder if this feeling of mine can be classified as love.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『What I want to hear are happy stories from Reiyu-chan, not such a serious and heavy tale of failure!』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Well, romantic advice is usually heavy, isn’t it? And what do you mean by failure…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Having it labeled as a failure hurt.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『You had a once-in-a-lifetime chance with someone you were interested in, and you blew it yourself. It’s nothing but a failure! Why didn’t you consult me earlier!?』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend who has been watching over me since my teens was angry as if it were her own matter.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Her words were unusually stern.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“But I only asked for his help because of the sudden rain. And I was just worried about him collapsing.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『And in the end, it was you who tempted him, Reiyu-chan.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Temptation? No way, that’s not it…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">That’s not my intention.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I was aware that I had been bolder than usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『If we count all your misdemeanors just for today, there’d be no end. You ran into him at the supermarket, had him carry your bags, and walked home together. You bought snacks on the way and fed him croquettes since his hands were full. You made him help bring in your laundry because it started raining. And then there’s the knee pillow&mdash;oh, how naughty.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“It’s not naughty! It was just taking care of him!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『By doing all those things, Reiyu-chan, it’s only natural for a man to make a move. If you really did all of that without any intention, I’d label you a terrible person and cut ties with you right now.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">It’s tough to have all my actions from today scrutinized, even though I explained everything openly.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Just stop it, I’m devastated.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『The one who’s really devastated is him! This could traumatize him for life.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’m left speechless by the assertive statement that leaves no room for a reply.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Listen, men are fundamentally timid creatures. Unless they’re overly confident or unreasonable, they’ll look for a chance but struggle to muster the courage. Reiyu-chan, at times like this, goes along with the mood and pretending a little is where women shine.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">Coming from someone who had captured and let go of many men’s hearts, her words carried weight.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Honestly, it was a technique beyond my realm.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Is romance something that can be thought out like that…?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Or maybe he’s just very mature. Considering that a certain duck who is new to love comes to a man’s room every night carrying a leek on her back, it’s amazing that he hasn’t pounced on you, driven by his youthful desires.』(TN: Duck here means naive/ unaware.)</p>
<p class="calibre4">“No way!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was so surprised my voice cracked.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『He takes care of you diligently without expecting anything in return. Such a promising and excellent prospect, I’d like to date him myself.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“He’s a high school student! What are you saying!?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Why act so high and mighty after avoiding him yourself? Poor neighbor boy, I want to comfort him…』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend consistently sided with Yuunagi-kun.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I haven’t rejected him yet. And he hasn’t clearly confessed his feelings either…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was desperately trying to justify myself.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『It’s almost as if he’s already said he likes you! Reiyu-chan, you’re clearly interested in him since you’ve spent so much time together. The fact that you’re coming to me like this is proof enough!』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Is that really the case? I guess it would turn out like that huh… Probably, yeah…”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Wow, liking someone but avoiding them, you’re a real pain in a real-life romance. Tsundere is only acceptable in two dimensions.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend was totally put off.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I just can’t handle the games of love.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『In this world, there are people who date just to try it out if they don’t dislike each other.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“How can I be so insincere to him!”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『It’s all well and good to pretend to be a sensible adult, but you’re not really putting it into practice at all.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend was harshly honest.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『By the way, women around him definitely notice a caring, straightforward guy like your neighbor. You think you’re keeping him on hold, but before you know it, he might start dating someone else.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was dismissed with a cold, cutting remark.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“He’s not that kind of frivolous guy.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『That’s all wishful thinking on Reiyu-chan’s part.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Don’t scare me like that.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『It’s just the truth.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t say anything in response.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『&mdash;&mdash;I know Reiyu-chan wouldn’t give a knee pillow to someone she doesn’t like. That’s why I wanted you to be prepared, at least mentally. I genuinely want to support and help achieve the slightly delayed first love of my best friend.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend confessed her deep regret.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“My…my first love?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『Moreover, it’s a romance of exceptionally high difficulty for a beginner like you. Rushing in driven by desire, you risk losing too much if you get exposed.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend knows I grew up in a loveless family environment.</p>
<p class="calibre4">She also understands how much I’ve invested in becoming a teacher.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s why she empathizes deeply and encourages me firmly, but she doesn’t recklessly push me forward.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yeah. It’s scary…it’s like I’m not myself anymore.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">When I’m with him, I lose control of my emotions.</p>
<p class="calibre4">My excitement grows, calmness fades, reason slackens, common sense numbs, optimism strengthens, and actions become bolder.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s embarrassing but not unpleasant.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I feel tense yet reassured.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I want to touch him but also don’t want to be touched.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Contradictory feelings and desires emerge.</p>

<p class="calibre4">I’ve never dated a man before, so everything feels new.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Experiencing countless firsts has been enjoyable.</p>
<p class="calibre4">With his support, my feelings have become positive, and there’s more enthusiasm in my life.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Ordinary days pass by as something special when we’re together.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Yes, first love is a painful thing.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I feel like crying at my best friend’s affirmation.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s too late to experience first love, yet too early to meet him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m an adult now.</p>

<p class="calibre4">His kindness makes me happy, but the situation where I can’t honestly accept it is painful.</p>
<p class="calibre4">As long as we are a teacher and a student, the emotions named love that sprout between us are a forbidden fruit that must never come to fruition.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yet, there’s a part of me that wants to reach out for it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Reiyu-chan, having seen your parents’ troubles, it’s understandable that you’re scared to fall in love. It’s not your fault, as no one can choose the family they’re born into. Don’t get that wrong.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Yeah.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『But, it’s unfair to end things by just imposing your situation on him.』</p>
<p class="calibre4">“I understand.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">『First of all, the guy next door understands the age and position differences between you two and still supports you, an inexperienced older woman. As your best friend, I can’t forgive you if you’re being unfair to such a kind-hearted person. After that, you are free to do whatever you want!』</p>

<p class="calibre4">My best friend scolds me more earnestly than anyone else.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I engrave her words deeply into myself.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Before hanging up, my best friend offered one last piece of advice.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『Even though many loves fade, if it’s true love, any trouble or obstacle is just a stepping stone that strengthens the bond between two people.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">I have no confidence I can move towards the future I desire.</p>
<p class="calibre4">But I didn’t want things to end awkwardly as they are.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I don’t want to lose this important relationship we have now.</p>
<p class="calibre4">That’s the true feeling of Reiyu Tenjō.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Alright!”</p>

<p class="calibre4">To keep a small promise I had made, I found myself in the kitchen, even though it was late at night.</p>

<p class="calibre4">***</p>

<p class="calibre4">Then, on Monday morning.</p>
<p class="calibre4">When I arrived at the classroom, the seat in front of me was empty.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Yuunagi Nishiki, who usually looked up to me, was unusually late.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Glancing towards the window, Akira Kuhouin was seated on time as usual.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei, can I start the class?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">While I stood silently at the podium, the class representative called out to me, snapping me back to reality.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Yes, please.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Even after finishing the morning homeroom, Yuunagi-kun still hadn’t shown up.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I couldn’t help but worry if yesterday’s incident was the reason.</p>

<p class="calibre4">What should I do?</p>
<p class="calibre4">Should I take a chance and send him a message later?</p>

<p class="calibre4">We usually keep to private communication, so we don’t talk about school-related things.</p>

<p class="calibre4">This morning, I couldn’t bring myself to let him know whether I’d have breakfast or not, so I came to school without stopping by his room.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I regretted not making up my mind to see him.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Being proactive is almost synonymous with taking action.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I loathed my own weakness for not being able to act as if My resolution from last night vanished somewhere.</p>
<p class="calibre4">And I realized how amazing the courage he had shown me yesterday was.</p>
<p class="calibre4">While I was pondering this, Kuhouin-san approached me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Tenjō-sensei, may I?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">It was the first time Kuhouin-san had initiated a conversation with me, and it caught me off guard.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Sensei?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Hmm? What’s wrong?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I forced a smile, but the words of my best friend from last night suddenly resurfaced in my mind.</p>

<p class="calibre4">『&mdash;&mdash;before you know it, he might start dating someone else.』</p>

<p class="calibre4">Those words stirred my heart.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Nishiki is sick with a cold and won’t be coming today. He asked me to tell you.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin-san’s expression remained unchanged as she bluntly relayed the message.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“A cold!? Is his fever high?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I was astonished by the unexpected news.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Maybe getting wet in the rain was bad for him.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I don’t know the details. But Sensei, aren’t you overreacting?”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Ah&mdash;ahaha. Um, I guess so. I just didn’t expect to hear it from Kuhouin-san and was surprised. Sorry.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I tried to laugh it off, but Kuhouin-san’s gaze felt somewhat cold.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“…I just happened to be in contact with Nishiki.”</p>
<p class="calibre4">“Huh, you two seem close. I had no idea.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I think to myself how insincere my acting must seem.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I had long known that he was making morning calls to wake up Kuhouin-san.</p>
<p class="calibre4">In a way, both Kuhouin-san and I are in similar positions, being helped by him.</p>

<p class="calibre4">Ah, this isn’t good.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I find myself feeling jealous of my student again.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I’m probably a little upset that he relied on someone other than me.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Hey, are you two dating?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Before I knew it, such a question had slipped out of my mouth.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“Not really. Nishiki is just a bit meddlesome. This time, he just happened to ask me to pass on a message. Um, that’s all.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">Kuhouin-san quickly ended the conversation and returned to her seat.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I opened the attendance book and marked Yuunagi Nishiki as absent.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even without writing it down, the absence of a student who’s always in front of me is really obvious and forces me to be aware of his absence.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The familiar scene changes so much, and it makes me feel uncomfortable.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“It’s fine. There’s no problem if it’s just between students.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I murmur in a voice no one can hear.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Even though I’m also a part of the second-year Class C, I’m different from everyone else.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Teacher and student. Adult and child. These obvious distinctions make me feel a little lonely.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Leaving the classroom and walking down the hallway, I can’t help but think about him.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“If he’s caught a cold, he should have told me directly.”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I become increasingly irritated, putting my own behavior aside.</p>
<p class="calibre4">It’s a selfish thought. After sending him home like that yesterday, it’s impossible to expect a message.</p>
<p class="calibre4">I wouldn’t be able to do it if our roles were reversed.</p>
<p class="calibre4">The fact that he asked Kuhouin-san to relay a message clearly shows he feels awkward about it.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“I wonder if he’s managing his food and medicine…”</p>

<p class="calibre4">In times like this, living alone is tough.</p>
<p class="calibre4">Without someone to take care of you, you have to move yourself even when you’re feeling awful. Otherwise, nothing gets done.</p>

<p class="calibre4">“&mdash;That’s what the Neighbor Agreement is for, isn’t it?”</p>

<p class="calibre4">I decided to do what needs to be done.</p>
