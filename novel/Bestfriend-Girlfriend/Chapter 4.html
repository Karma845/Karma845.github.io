<h1>Chapter 4: The Dark Hotpot of Love</h1>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>

<p>Karaoke went as planned, taking place on Friday after school. Gathering at the reception desk of a prominent karaoke chain near the station were the following members: myself, Nanamura, Sayu, Miyachi, Asaki-san, and Yorka—six in total.</p>



<p>While waiting for our turn at the reception, I nervously watched the two newcomers meeting for the first time.</p>



<p>“Nice to meet you. I’m Yukinami Sayu, Ki-senpai’s kouhai.”</p>



<p>“I’m Arisaka Yorka. Hello.” Yorka spoke quietly with a composed expression. Hmm, her voice was a bit rigid. But well, just exchanging greetings was already a big improvement. If it were the Yorka from last year, she’d probably remain silent out of nervousness.</p>



<p>To others, she might have seemed constantly displeased, creating an impression of an unapproachable beauty. Or people might be intimidated by her appareance and shrunk back awkwardly. However, Sayu wasn’t deterred.</p>



<p>“I know. You’re Ki-senpai’s girlfriend, right? I was really surprised to learn he’s dating such a beautiful girl. Your face is truly lovely up close. Even a girl like me can’t help but be captivated.”</p>



<p>“Hey, have we met somewhere before?” Yorka suddenly questioned Sayu.</p>



<p>“No, this is the first time we’re talking like this.”</p>



<p>“…I see. My mistake, then.” Yorka seemed dissatisfied, but she didn’t pursue it further.</p>



<p>“Anyway, don’t look at me too much. I’m not comfortable being stared.”</p>



<p>“Oh, you’re shy. How cute. Hey, can I call you Yor-senpai?”</p>



<p>Yorka seemed unsure about how to handle Sayu, who was closing both physical and emotional distances. “Hey, Kisumi, help me out here. This girl is coming on too strong.”</p>



<p>“Right. Sayu, tone it down a bit.”</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai is always flirting with Yor-senpai, so let me have my turn once in a while, okay?”</p>



<p>“We’re not flirting!” Yorka immediately denied.</p>



<p>“You’re quick to deny it. I thought Ki-senpai was the one who’s whipped, but maybe it’s the opposite. Interesting.”</p>



<p>Yorka became even more defenseless after Sayu easily saw through her. “Stop teasing me. I don’t like that kind of stuff.”</p>



<p>“Ah, my bad. I got carried away there. Forgive me, Yor-senpai. In return, I’ll spill all the details about Ki-senpai from our middle school days!”</p>



<p>“I forgive you.”</p>



<p>That was fast, Yorka!</p>



<p>“Now, spill everything you know.”</p>



<p>“Then you can just call me Sayu-chan.”</p>



<p>“Sayu-chan. Sure thing.” Yorka readily accepted that request too. <em>Why is she so eager?</em></p>



<p>“Sena-san, the group of six. Please come to the reception counter.” Before I could add my two cents, I was called. I completed the procedure at the reception.</p>



<p>“We got a room, let’s take the elevator up.” When I spoke up, everyone gathered in a corner of the lobby.</p>



<p>“Sayu-chan, what’s with all these outfits?”</p>



<p>“They’re offering free rental for cosplay costumes. How about we all give it a try?”</p>



<p>“Eh, that’s embarrassing!”</p>



<p>“Yor-senpai, change into one too. Let’s take some pictures together. It’ll be so much fun!”</p>



<p>While I was momentarily distracted, Yorka and Sayu seemed to be getting along.</p>



<p>“Cosplay sounds fun!” Miyachi agreed too.</p>



<p>“I’m in too. Hey, Kisumi-kun, any requests?” Asaki-san asked me right in front of Yorka.</p>



<p>“Uh, Hasekura-chan, you won’t ask me?”</p>



<p>“Nanamura-kun would probably pick something ecchi without hesitation.”</p>



<p>“Of course,” Nanamura didn’t flinch.</p>



<p>Yorka came to my side and asked, “Which one do you like?”</p>



<p>“Can I decide?”</p>



<p>“Don’t pick anything too lewd.”</p>



<p>“I’ll save the really daring ones for when we’re alone.”</p>



<p>“Idiot.” Yorka lightly tapped my arm.</p>



<p>When I mentioned my preference, Yorka said, “This should be fine,” and picked the outfit I requested.</p>



<p>Yeah, coming here today might have been a good idea.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>Each with our costumes in tow, we rode the elevator to the upper floor. Upon reaching the room, the ladies changed into their costumes, leaving Nanamura and me waiting in the hallway.</p>



<p>“Ah, this is getting interesting, Sena.”</p>



<p>“That’s just you.”</p>



<p>“Gathering only a group of high-level girls like a hotpot, we’ve got quite the popular guy here, don’t we?”</p>



<p>“You’re noisy.”</p>



<p>“It’s really pitiable that Sena-sama can’t enjoy this wholeheartedly.”</p>



<p>Nanamura couldn’t stop laughing. My girlfriend, the two girls I rejected, and an oblivious junior who had no clue about the situation—all characters who shouldn’t be together under normal circumstances were now assembled.</p>



<p>“Even Arisaka-chan joined in the moment she heard Hasekura-chan was coming. Could it be a cute hint of jealousy? Well, with Hasekura-chan, it’s understandable to be on guard.”</p>



<p>“To be honest, it’s incredibly unsettling.”</p>



<p>“If something happens, Miyauchi will probably handle it. Besides, Yukinami-chan gets along well with everyone, so it should be fine.”</p>



<p>“That’s, well… I honestly didn’t expect that.”</p>



<p>“Anyway! Let’s look forward to what’s coming next!” Nanamura gave me a light pat on the back. And finally, the time arrived.</p>



<p>“Alright! Senpais, you can come in now! A lovely paradise awaits you inside!”</p>



<p>Upon entering the room, we were greeted by an atmosphere bursting with excitement.</p>



<p>“Sena, this is… dangerous.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, it’s a bit beyond what I imagined.”</p>



<p>Overwhelmed by the sight of this peachy utopia, we swallowed hard, savoring the happiness in silence. <em>Thank you, otaku culture. Hail cosplay!</em></p>



<p>“Ta-da! How is it? Doesn’t it suit us well? I’ll introduce each outfit, so please give us some nice comments!”  Sayu, brimming with joy, began by explaining her outfit. “As the opening act, I’m the Mini-Skirt Police!”</p>



<p>She wore a cap-like police hat, a light blue shirt with a tie, and a mini-skirt that defied the typical image of a female police officer. She even had accessories like a toy gun and handcuffs.</p>



<p>“I’m going to arrest you, bang~☆” Sayu, with theatrical flair, drew her gun from its holster and pretended to fire.</p>



<p>“Shooting without warning, huh? This police force is more sinister than I thought.”</p>



<p>“Woo, if it’s her, I wouldn’t mind getting arrested.” Nanamura clutched his chest and collapsed into a dramatic kneeling pose. He was quite the principled guy.</p>



<p>“Come on, Ki-senpai, lighten up. Nanamura-senpai’s got a great reaction! Now, Miyauchi-senpai, you’re up!”</p>



<p>“Sure thing! I’m a cat-eared maid.” Miyachi did a spin, the long hem of her skirt gracefully flared out. With her daring fashion sense—blonde hair, piercings—and the unexpected addition of cat ears and tail, it was a whole new level of fashion statement.</p>



<p>“Master, how may I serve you, meow?” Miyachi fully embraced her role.</p>



<p>“Even your cat-like poses are on point. It suits you, Miyachi.”</p>



<p>“Uwah, I want to be served too!” Nanamura breathed heavily.</p>



<p>“Calm down, Nanamu, you’re getting too excited,” Miyachi, reverting to her usual self, laughed.</p>



<p>“Next up, Asa-senpai! Go ahead.”</p>



<p>“As you can see, I’m in a nurse’s outfit.”</p>



<p>Asaki-san wore a tight, peculiarly fitting pink nurse uniform that emphasized her curves. A nurse cap on her head, a stethoscope around her neck, and a syringe in hand. The cardigan she brought added an authentic touch.</p>



<p>“You’re so brave for enduring the shot ~” Asaki-san stroke a pose with a syringe in hand.</p>



<p>“An angel in white!”</p>



<p>“Actually, let me give a real shot—”</p>



<p>Before I could finish my sentence, I punched Nanamura in the stomach.</p>



<p>“Nanamura, seriously, cut it out.”</p>



<p>My knuckles feel the brunt of his ever-tight abs.</p>



<p>“Ahem. Last but not least, Yor-senpai, if you please!”</p>



<p>“I chose the flight attendant costume… as requested.”</p>



<p>A small hat, a large and breezy scarf, gold buttons on a navy-striped jacket, and a tight skirt—Yorka’s chic attire matched her mature aura perfectly. Like the others, she had probably been coached by Sayu on what to say.</p>



<p>With a bit of fidgeting, Yorka looked at me, then seemed to gather her courage. She pursed her lips before finally speaking.</p>



<p>“A-Attention, all passengers.”</p>



<p>“I want to fly first class, please!” I swiftly made the reservation—no, I expressed my thoughts with utmost seriousness.</p>


<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"><div><img src="https://plebianfinetranslation.wordpress.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/img_1_13-book_reader_readera.png" alt="" /></div></figure>
</figure>



<p>“Ki-senpai, that was too quick!”</p>



<p>“You’re overly enthusiastic, Sumisumi!”</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, you might want to take a step back.”</p>



<p>The girls immediately chimed in with their comments.</p>



<p>“Hahaha, Sena, you’re not that different,” Nanamura laughed heartily.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kisumi, try not to stare so much. It’s not weird, right?”</p>



<p>“It looks stunningly good. Really, it’s dangerously good!” I couldn’t take my eyes off Yorka in front of me and was oblivious to everyone’s words.</p>



<p>“Alright, let’s move on to the photo session! Oh, and gentlemen, using your own smartphones for pictures is prohibited. It’s ladies-only today, and posting a group photo on social media is also off-limits.”</p>



<p>“That’s so harsh! Please send it to me later, Yukinami-chan,” Nanamura pleaded.</p>



<p>“Sorry, it’s a no from Yor-senpai!” Sayu flatly rejected.</p>



<p>“Guys, just burn these images into your minds. Isn’t just being here a form of happiness?”</p>



<p>“Fine, I’ll sneakily take a few later.”</p>



<p>“In that case, we’ll leave immediately. And Nanamura-senpai will cover the bill.” Sayu declared, undeterred by the stubborn carnivorous senpai. After losing to the disapproving looks from the other three girls, Nanamura quietly backed off.</p>



<p>By the way, wasn’t this karaoke place a bit too well-stocked with costumes and accessories?</p>



<p>As the photo shoot wrapped up, everyone was so hyped that their throats were parched.</p>



<p>“We got too hyped even before singing. Anyone up for a drink refill?” At Sayu’s words, I ordered a new round of drinks for everyone.</p>



<p>Arranged in a U-shape on the couch, Nanamura, Miyachi, Asaki-san, Sayu, Yorka, and I took our seats in that order. It seemed Nanamura had the first song in mind and swiftly inputted it into the terminal.</p>


<p>“We’re here to karaoke! We’re going to sing our hearts out from here on!”</p>



<p>Leading the charge, Nanamura stood up with a microphone in hand and shouted. When the music started, the room dimmed, and the ceiling’s mirror ball began to spin. Fragments of light scattered throughout the room, creating a kaleidoscope of colors.</p>



<p>Nanamura showcased his rap skills, effortlessly elevating the atmosphere with an upbeat song. His ability to weave rhymes, delivering a rapid-fire flow of words, was genuinely impressive and undeniably cool. With such a charismatic performance, it was no wonder he could make many girls swoon.</p>



<p>“Yukinami-chan, you’re up next!”</p>



<p>For the second act, Sayu chose a trendy idol song, complete with choreography. The bright and cute melody was not only fun to hear but also enhanced by the cosplay, adding a touch of realism to the idol scene. Nanamura and I couldn’t resist shaking a tambourine and maracas as a substitute for glow sticks.</p>



<p>“Come on, do some <em>otagei</em><sup data-fn="aa572ac4-2bad-4ba8-abd2-0c97679f7ee5" class="fn"><a href="#aa572ac4-2bad-4ba8-abd2-0c97679f7ee5" id="aa572ac4-2bad-4ba8-abd2-0c97679f7ee5-link">1</a></sup>!”</p>



<p>Everyone laughed at Sayu’s playful request. Nanamura and Sayu’s impressive performances had already heated things up.</p>



<p>Taking the stage as the third performer was Miyachi. Surprisingly, she opted for a Western song—an upbeat, cheerful pop number also featured in Japanese commercials. We all recognized the melody but weren’t quite familiar with the lyrics. Yet, Miyachi flawlessly sang the entire song in English. Come to think of it, she excelled in that subject too.</p>



<p>“Your English is amazing!” Sayu exclaimed, clearly impressed.</p>



<p>Since the next song hadn’t been entered yet, Miyachi continued with another performance. This time, she shifted gears to an anime song, a classic predating our time—she sang “Ram’s Love Song” in her adorable cat-maid outfit, delivering a destruction power that was beyond imagination.</p>



<p>“Alright, who’s next?” Miyachi passed the microphone like a baton.</p>



<p>It was Asaki-san’s turn. She chose to sing “Instinct (本能)” by Shiina Ringo<sup data-fn="bf135c42-fda3-452b-a34f-1bde76004475" class="fn"><a href="#bf135c42-fda3-452b-a34f-1bde76004475" id="bf135c42-fda3-452b-a34f-1bde76004475-link">2</a></sup>, famously known for its music video featuring nurses breaking glass. Asaki-san sang the powerful and sensual lyrics with strength, infusing frustration and weariness into her voice. I was mesmerized by her performance.</p>



<p>“It feels so good to sing,” Asaki-san commented with a refreshing expression.</p>



<p>Now, it was my turn. Everyone had been so impressed until now that I felt a bit pressured.</p>



<p>The distinctive intro began, and the song I selected was “<em>Koi</em> (Love)” by Hoshino Gen<sup data-fn="2e6b3136-1bdd-48d0-bac9-1d7b275a5f65" class="fn"><a href="#2e6b3136-1bdd-48d0-bac9-1d7b275a5f65" id="2e6b3136-1bdd-48d0-bac9-1d7b275a5f65-link">3</a></sup>—the theme song of the drama “Nigeru wa Haji da ga Yaku ni Tatsu,” known for the popular “Koi Dance” performed by the cast in the ending credits and became a social phenomenon.</p>



<p>“Oh, I love this one too. I used to watch the drama every week in real-time!”</p>



<p>“I never missed an episode; I always recorded it.”</p>



<p>“I was always curious about the last-minute twists; I couldn’t wait for the next week.”</p>



<p>“I watched this with my older sister.”</p>



<p>I did well by choosing a song everyone knew. Quite a nice selection, if I said so myself. During the chorus, everyone danced the Koi Dance in sync with the music while sitting.</p>



<p>“Thanks!” I shouted with post-song high energy amidst the applause.</p>



<p>After the applause settled, it was finally Yorka’s turn. The beautiful melody introduced one of Takeuchi Mariya’s iconic songs, ‘Plastic Love.’ In recent years, the City Pop genre had gained reevaluation overseas, and cover<sup data-fn="0e8115c9-d511-4477-969f-8b6f61f4ef42" class="fn"><a href="#0e8115c9-d511-4477-969f-8b6f61f4ef42" id="0e8115c9-d511-4477-969f-8b6f61f4ef42-link">4</a></sup> videos of this song had recorded staggering views. Yorka flawlessly sang this classic with her exceptionally beautiful voice.</p>



<p>“””Amazing,””” all five of us in the audience shared the same impression.</p>



<p>Listening silently, the dazzling city night view depicted in the song seemed to materialize before our eyes. I couldn’t help but be impressed by my girlfriend’s ability to excel at anything.</p>



<p>A perfect superhuman with capabilities beyond the ordinary—virtually flawless. Though she had a rare weakness of getting nervous in public, she excelled at almost everything she tried.</p>



<p>As we approached the second chorus, a waiter entered, announcing, “Here are your refill drinks!”</p>



<p>Yorka immediately stopped singing, creating that subtle yet peculiar pause where only the music played.</p>



<p>“Just sing; the staff is used to it and won’t mind,” I whispered to her.</p>



<p>“I don’t want strangers hearing me.”</p>



<p>“What about these folks?”</p>



<p>“It’s barely acceptable.”</p>



<p>“How about you go next without me?”</p>



<p>“No way. You’re a prerequisite; a must-have condition.”</p>



<p>“I see…” Being told so straightforwardly made me embarrassed too.</p>



<p>The waiter efficiently placed the new drinks, collected the empty glasses, and swiftly exited. He showed a sophisticated service without wasted movements.</p>



<p>After the door closed, Yorka resumed singing.</p>



<p><em>Hmm, she’s really good.</em></p>



<p>We, who had been listening, found ourselves lingering in the afterglow, unable to move even after the song ended.</p>



<p>“It’s embarrassing,” Yorka said while gently placing the microphone on the table.</p>



<p>“Arisaka-chan, you’re amazing! You should aim to be a singer. I’d totally support you!”</p>



<p>“Yor-senpai, apply for an audition right now! No, sing one more time! I’ll record it and upload it to social media!”</p>



<p>Nanamura and Sayu were so excited that they leaned forward from their chairs.</p>



<p>“I don’t like standing out.”</p>



<p>Even though we all came to karaoke together, Yorka remained true to herself.</p>



<p>The karaoke continued into the second round, with each of us showcasing our singing abilities with diverse song choices.</p>



<p>“Why are you so good at singing?” I asked Yorka between songs.</p>



<p>“My mom loves music, so our house always had various genres playing. I also took piano lessons when I was little.”</p>



<p>“Music was a part of your daily life. But singing?”</p>



<p>“My older sister is good at it, and I often imitated her. It just naturally improved over time.”</p>



<p>“I see. It’s quite different from the impression you give now.”</p>



<p>It was hard to imagine Yorka imitating someone else.</p>



<p>“That’s a story from my childhood,” she answered with a slightly displeased tone.</p>



<p>“Well, I get it. Even I used to sing with my sister every time we took a bath. The bathroom makes your voice echo.” I unintentionally shared a childhood memory from a brother’s perspective.</p>



<p>Although my sister had physically grown up, she was once a child too. When I was in elementary school, we sometimes bathed together. While soaking in the tub, she often asked, “<em>Kisumi-kun, let’s sing together</em>,” pleadingly.</p>



<p>“Huh? Kisumi, are you still taking baths with Ei-chan?” Yorka shot me a suspicious look.</p>



<p>“Hell no! That’s absurd!”</p>



<p>“Right. Because Ei-chan likes you very much, I can’t help but guess that. Even when I intruded last time when she finished bathing, you didn’t seem bothered at all.”</p>



<p>“She’s just being careless. I’m actually telling her to have more modesty and shame.” I sighed, venting my frustration. Especially in the summer, she still casually roamed around with just a bath towel wrapped around her. <em>Cut me some slack.</em></p>



<p>“It’s fine, right? One day, she might start disliking her brother. Then you’ll look back at the times when she clung to you and feel lonely.”</p>



<p>“I’d actually feel happy if she grew a bit more independent.”</p>



<p>“You’re putting on a brave front.”</p>



<p>“I’m serious.”</p>



<p>“But if she ever asked for help, you’d lend a hand anytime, right?”</p>



<p>“…Yorka, do you enjoy seeing through us siblings like this?”</p>



<p>“Well, it seems I hit the mark. Good to know.” Yorka seemed satisfied that her intuition was correct.</p>



<p>“It’s because she’s my one and only sister. Besides, you have an older sister too. She even helped us out with that thing the other day with Kanzaki-sensei.”</p>



<p>The morning after Yorka stayed over due to heavy rain, someone saw me seeing Yorka off at the station by chance. Then Yorka’s older sister, who happened to be Kanzaki-sensei’s former student, helped out and ensured things didn’t escalate.</p>



<p>“Things almost went south when you announced our relationship, though.”</p>



<p>“Was your sister angry?”</p>



<p>“On the contrary, she found it hilarious. She said, ‘<em>Your boyfriend is quite interesting</em>‘.”</p>



<p>Seems like our relationship didn’t leave a bad impression on her family. I felt a weight off my chest.</p>



<p>“Please express my gratitude and apologize on my behalf.”</p>



<p>“I don’t want to. If you want that, say it yourself.”</p>



<p>“Huh? You want me to meet her?”</p>



<p>“…N-no! It’s not like that. It’s still too early!” Yorka frantically rejected the idea.</p>



<p>“Because my sister insisted on asking, I told her the bare minimum. Although she knew that I had a boyfriend, I didn’t reveal your name.”</p>



<p>“Is my presence in the Arisaka household really a taboo?” I couldn’t help but ask with a serious tone, feeling a bit concerned.</p>



<p>“It’s just that I’m shy, so I’m trying to hide it. Unlike me, my sister has a lot of friends and acquaintances, so news about you could spread like wildfire.”</p>



<p>“She seems like a quite protective older sister,” I tried to interpret it in the most positive light.</p>



<p>“Hmm, it’s just that my older sister likes playing with me.”</p>



<p>“It’s part of expressing her sisterly affection.”</p>



<p>“Well, it feels a bit bothersome from my perspective,” Yorka admitted with a complex expression.</p>



<p>“I hope you can overlook it a bit.”</p>



<p>“Is that your true sentiment as a big brother?”</p>



<p>“No comment.”</p>



<p>“It’s obvious that you and Ei-chan are really close.”</p>



<p>“Same goes for you. From my perspective, you and your sister seem like great sisters.”</p>



<p>Judging by Yorka’s words, her older sister might be the type who loved her little sister so much that she couldn’t resist pampering her like a cat.</p>



<p>“….You’ll eventually meet face to face at some point. Just don’t try to curry favor with my big sister.”</p>



<p>“Don’t worry. When that happens, I’ll shower you with compliments, so rest assured.”</p>



<p>“Please don’t, my sister would be overjoyed.”</p>



<p>“It’ll be fine. I just want to convey your charm as I see it.”</p>



<p>“Then I’ll do the exact same thing when I visit the Sena household next time,” Yorka threatened, though she seemed a bit embarrassed.</p>



<p>“…That sounds tough.”</p>



<p>Ei would gladly go along with the conversation. But I didn’t have confidence in maintaining composure if my parents were there on the day when Yorka would reveal a different side of me to the family.</p>



<p>“Exactly.”</p>



<p>For someone unaccustomed to being showered with compliments, it was indeed an uncomfortable situation.</p>



<p>“Hey, hey. You two aren’t in your own little world, are you?”</p>



<p>Nanamura’s teasing voice snapped us back to reality. The song had ended without us noticing, and the other four were staring at us.</p>



<p>Nanamura grinned mischievously, Miyachi observed with an amused smile, Asaki-san looked exasperated, and then there was Sayu, casting a cold, skeptical look.</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai, it’s fine to daydream, but meeting each other’s parents already? That’s too hasty. It feels burdensome for us girls.”</p>



<p>“This is our private affair.”</p>



<p>“A high school romance thinking about marriage? You’re quite the romantic.”</p>



<p>“Romantic my foot. We’ll inevitably meet each other’s families, anyway.”</p>



<p>“Well, love is good and all, but if you start too strong, you’ll burn out quickly,”</p>



<p>“I, for one, plan to keep burning,”</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai, you feel thrilled because Yor-senpai is beautiful. I understand that. But, if you set your expectations too high, you might get disappointed,” Sayu scolded me.</p>



<p>“Yukinami-san, you have a pretty pragmatic view of things,” Miyachi listened with interest.</p>



<p>“Well, when it’s time to part, they’ll part. Even if you don’t break up in a fight, the freshness will fade inevitably. You get used to each other, and sometimes, you get bored. Whether you break up or not is a matter for the people involved.” Nanamura was straightforward.</p>



<p>“You seem devoid of romantic dreams, Nanamura-kun.”</p>



<p>“Romance is realistic. Even those who dream about love will wake up once they interact with a real person. It’s dangerous not to wake up. Things don’t always go as you wish, and you can’t always become what your partner idealizes. …I thought you were on this side too, Hasekura-chan.”</p>



<p>Asaki-san’s words surprised Nanamura.</p>



<p>“Maybe I’m the type who can’t easily fall for someone. The moment I realize I like someone, it feels special. It might seem trivial to others, but for me, it’s decisive.”</p>



<p>Asaki-san shared her perspective while glancing briefly at the cluttered table.</p>



<p>We listened in silence.</p>



<p>Noticing the shift in atmosphere, Asaki-san hastily added, “But, I guess for someone with many romantic experiences, it might feel a bit dreamy!”</p>



<p>“I can kinda relate,” Yorka was the first to agree.</p>



<p>For the first time today, Yorka and Asaki-san’s eyes met. It surprised not only me but also Nanamura and Miyachi. However, Asaki-san seemed the most astonished.</p>



<p>“Thank you, Arisaka-san.”</p>



<p>“I’d like to hear more,” Yorka requested, and Asaki-san continued.</p>



<p>“Love isn’t just about being in a relationship with someone; it also includes the gradual process leading up to that. In extreme terms, you can say love can even exist when you’re alone.”</p>



<p>“Right,” Yorka nodded.</p>



<p>“Even the time spent thinking about someone you like is a valid form of love. Because, isn’t that enjoyable in itself? It may be events in your mind, but the joy of envisioning it is wonderful.”</p>



<p>Falling for someone—it was an incredibly fulfilling period. Love wasn’t solely defined by reciprocation. It might bring forth poignant emotions, or it could be a comfortable one-sided affection. Yet, the shared feelings might end up as dreams or illusions.</p>



<p>“Would it end up being a one-sided crush? Or would you decide to confess your feelings? If you want to confess, you’ll start by exchanging contact information, invite them to hang out, deepen your connection. That’s when reality starts to connect.”</p>



<p>Yorka nodded earnestly.</p>



<p>If you had ever experienced love, it was a feeling everyone could relate to. It could be a first, sentimental attachment or naive assumptions. Perhaps, with many experiences, you might become accustomed or even jaded. However, youth was about immaturity and sensitivity, making it uniquely special. <em>At least I think so.</em></p>



<p>“──Are you just glorifying heartbreak to grow up?” The discontented voice belonged to Sayu.</p>



<p>“Why do you think that?” Asaki-san calmly countered her junior.</p>



<p>“Because it feels like you’re romanticizing unrequited love and turning failed romances into happy memories. Aren’t you frustrated? Doesn’t it hurt?”</p>



<p>“Hey, Sayu. What’s gotten into you all of a sudden?”</p>



<p>“Senpai, please stay quiet,” Sayu sharply glared at me who was trying to mediate.</p>



<p>“…Regardless of why Sayu-chan is worked up, the answer is simple.”</p>



<p>“I’m curious.”</p>
