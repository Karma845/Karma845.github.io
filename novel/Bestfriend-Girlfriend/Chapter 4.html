<h1>Chapter 4: Youta Ootomo Could Only Be Placed Here by Process of Elimination</h1>

<p>I was waiting at the station for Awayuki’s arrival, recalling my conversation with Ohana. <br /> <br />[So you don’t have any emotions, huh…] <br /> <br />[Yeah, that’s right.] <br /> <br />[No way, you must be joking…]  <br /> <br />[Does this look like the face of someone telling a joke?] <br /> <br />[It does! You’re making a weird face again! Pfft…hahahahaha!] <br /> <br />[Yes, I got to see Ohana’s smile again. I’m satisfied.] <br /> <br />[Geez…nevermind me! More importantly, what do you mean you don’t have emotions!? There’s no way a human could─] <br /> <br />[But there is. Right here.] <br /> <br />[………………………You, you’re serious?] <br /> <br />[Yes. My brain is made that way.]  <br /> <br />[Made that way…?] <br /> <br />[But, I want to try crying. I think human tears are beautiful. If I could cry even once, this doll might become more human.] <br /> <br />[………………………………………] <br /> <br />[What’s wrong, Ohana?] <br /> <br />[─I understand. Let’s go play.] <br /> <br />[Huh?] <br /> <br />[Next Sunday, let’s go out into town! I’ll come up with a full-proof plan to make Tera-san cry!] <br /> <br />[But didn’t you just say enemies don’t get along?] <br /> <br />[Who cares about stuff like that! It’s the body mom and dad gave you, Tera shouldn’t say things like that! No emotions? …There’s no way! I’ll prove to you that I can absolutely make Tera-san cry and show she’s just a normal girl!] <br /> <br />[Whisper whisper…Ohana, it seems like you’ve completely forgotten that if you make me cry, you’ll become the next Ten-Sai…] <br /> <br />[Ah…you’re right, I did forget that!] <br /> <br />[I see…she’s totally lost it. This girl is just like that I guess…] <br /> <br />[Okay. Then I’ll go out with Ohana.]  <br /> <br />[Alright! I need to put my heart into coming up with a plan! Oh, will you come too, Daikyo?] <br /> <br />[Huh? Why me? I’m unrelated.] <br /> <br />[What are you saying? Daikyo and I are…umm…that’s right! We’re comrades who’ve eaten the same crappy food!] <br /> <br />[Why am I being lumped in with you for getting thrown in jail!?] <br /> <br />[Ohana, I think you mean comrades who’ve shared the same pot of food?] <br /> <br />[That’s it, Tera-san! As expected of the number one in the nation!] <br /> <br />[No, you’re just ignorant…plus Daikyo and Ohana just met for the first time yesterday…] <br /> <br />[Now now, don’t sweat the details.] <br /> <br />[But still, if the two of you are together even if it’s off campus, it’ll look kinda─] <br /> <br />[W-What’s wrong, Daikyo? Why’d you suddenly yell…?] <br /> <br />[Damn these choice mechanics… Sorry, circumstances on my end. Just ignore it…] <br /> <br />[? Daikyo, you do things like this a lot huh. Well, whatever. So the three of us will─]  <br /> <br />[Yosano Akiko!] <br /> <br />[Why are you suddenly doing an M-leg spread!?] <br /> <br />[That’s what I wanna know!] <br /> <br />[Hmm. I thought Daikyo was the straight man, but this is a bit unexpected.] <br /> <br />[N-No, this isn’t about joking or─Hojo Masako!] <br /> <br />[Why’d you suddenly start rubbing your cheeks on the floor!?] <br /> <br />[I said that’s what I wanna know!] <br /> <br />[Does Daikyo get excited by taking humiliating poses while shouting female leaders’ names?] <br /> <br />[Don’t ask me seriously! It’s not like that! I can’t explain it but─Ono no Imoko!] <br /> <br />[Why’d you suddenly do a throwing kiss then tsukkomi!?]  <br /> <br />[Don’t ask meeeeeee!] <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Just what was with that great person naming compulsion… Recalling it makes my chest burn.  <br /> <br />Oh well, nevermind me. The main issue right now is─ <br /> <br />“She’s not coming…is she?” <br /> <br />“Doesn’t seem like it…” <br /> <br />It was eleven o’clock, our promised meeting time, but there was no sign of Awayuki.  <br /> <br />I glanced down at my smartphone’s clock. <br /> <br />Oh, it wasn’t exactly time yet. Still 10:59─ <br /> <br />Whoosh! <br /> <br />“Yo, bro!” <br /> <br />With a sound slicing through the wind, Awayuki suddenly appeared before me. <br /> <br />“Hello, this is Tera-chan from Awayuki!” <br /> <br />“W-Wow, that was fast… As expected, incredible speed…”  <br /> <br />“Good, I barely made it in time.” <br /> <br />“Ah, no need to rush that dangerously… Being a little late would’ve been fine too, you know?” <br /> <br />“Being late is bad, and I absolutely won’t crash into anyone at this speed. Actually, I arrived and was waiting 30 minutes ago─but a granny carrying a really heavy furoshiki bag had hurt her leg and was troubled, so I gave her a piggyback ride to the police box, then three people who could only speak Portuguese, Punjabi, and Bengali respectively were lost on the road so I gave them directions, and a job hunting student on the verge of being late for an interview was in tears, so I came up with the shortest train transfer route that wouldn’t show up in an internet search and told them, and two cats were in a huge fight so I blended some ingredients I could buy at the convenience store to make a special milk with sedative effects and patched up their quarrel, and the owner of an eel restaurant seemed worried about attracting customers, so taking wind direction, temperature, humidity into account, I calculated the diffusion of smell for maximum efficiency and advised them, then it came down to the wire. Sorry.” <br /> </p>







<p><br />…Huh? <br /> <br />“That was…a lot to take in. Just how much of a genius were you in those 30 minutes…?” <br /> <br />And she’s not even bragging, just calmly explaining what happened… This is probably normal for her.  <br /> <br />“But everyone was happy, so I’m glad.” <br /> <br />Saying she’s satisfied with the same expressionless face─this girl is beyond human comprehension. <br /> <br />“Well, if you’re not troubled yourself…”  <br /> <br />Snip! <br /> <br />Just then, a strange sound came from below.  <br /> <br />“W-What was that… Oh, the hem of my pants ripped! …Why though? It didn’t seem frayed or anything this morning…” <br /> <br />Invisible damage building up, or catching it on something without noticing… Either way, it’s an unfortunate accident. <br /> <br />“Oh no… For it to mysteriously rip like that, Daikyo really has the worst luck…” <br /> <br />“Forget it… The rip isn’t that deep anyway, so I can just─” <br /> <br />“Leave it to me. Stay still for a sec, Daikyo.” <br /> <br />What? What? <br /> <br />Before I could even react, Awayuki took a small box out of her waist pouch and crouched down─ <br /> <br />“Shwap shwap shwap!” <br /> <br />It looked like needles were glinting at an imperceptible speed…  <br /> <br />Hey, I think I see something shiny like a needle… Is she sewing!? <br /> <br />“There, done.”  <br /> <br />In the next instant after I had that thought, the work was already complete.  <br /> <br />“No way… I can’t even see the stitch marks, it’s like it was never torn in the first place… If anything, it looks cleaner than before it ripped…” <br /> <br />With that speed and quality of work…it’s nothing short of godly skill. <br /> <br />“It’s rare for it to rip this much, but it’s pretty common for clothes to fray a little. So I always keep a sewing kit ready for times like this.” <br /> <br />I knew Awayuki was incredible, but seeing it up close is kind of terrifying… And that’s not even her specialized talent, just sewing. Everything else she can do is even more absurd. <br /> <br />“Anyway, thanks for saving me. I ‘pre-she-ate it.” <br /> <br />“Yeah, yeah, I’m not mad.” <br /> <br />Awayuki does a carefree “ehehe” pose, but as expected, her expression doesn’t change. <br /> <br />“Well, that aside, thanks to you and Ohana for taking time out of your day for me. You’ll become Ten-Sai instantly if I cry, so do your best, Ohana.”  <br /> <br />“Eh…? Ten-Sai…?” <br /> <br />“Yeah. If I cry, Ohana will become [Teio Ten-Sai] in my place.” <br /> <br />“Ah…that’s right, I did say that!” <br /> <br />Looks like she had forgotten after all… <br /> <br />“At first I was thinking anything goes, like shooting hot pepper extract from a water gun in your face, locking you in a sealed room and forcing you to listen to Daikyo’s past misfortunes for 24 hours, beating you until you cry and refusing to stop, but I completely forgot I just had to make you cry no matter what to prove you’re a normal girl!” <br /> <br />As ruthless as ever… <br /> <br />“But that was because I was confident you wouldn’t cry and was trying to get position as Ten-Sai. If it’s actually the opposite, and you’ve never cried before and wish you could…then it’s meaningless unless I genuinely help you do so.”  <br /> <br />So you’re considerate at heart after all. <br /> <br />“Anyway, want me to perform the tear-jerking play I practiced all night?” <br /> <br />Before I could react, Ohana knelt to the ground and reached out pleadingly.  <br /> <br />Looks like she’s doing [The Little Match Girl]. <br /> <br />“Oh, won’t someone…won’t someone please buy my matches?” <br /> <br />“Oh no…not a single one sold. If I go home like this, father will beat me.” <br /> <br />Huh? …She’s unexpectedly good at this. Great acting ability, draws you right in… <br /> <br />“Brr…it’s so cold…I know, I’ll light one to warm up.”  <br /> <br />After this, the little girl would see happy visions in the match fire before ultimately losing her life… If done at this quality, it might actually get me a little teary-eyed. <br /> <br />“Ahh…so warm… A Dai✱o brand oil heater is more efficient than matches after all!” <br /> <br />“What happened to the setting!?” <br /> <br />“Huh? Aren’t you cold? Hurry and use this! Whoa, a Del✱ng brand fan heater!  <br /> <br />“What’s powering it!? There’s no outlets on the Andersen-esque streetside! How’d you turn on the Dai✱on!?” <br /> <br />“The girl saved by the warmth of humanity and the latest home appliances threw away her matches and learned to play with fire, skillfully wrapping men around her finger, bleed them dry, and lived comfortably ever after. Happily ever after.”  <br /> <br />“Don’t start ad-libbing a happy ending!” <br /> <br />No good…too many tsukkomi points.  <br /> <br />“But…when I reread it for this play, it was just too sad…so…” <br /> <br />“I understand the feeling, but we’re trying to make Awayuki cry. Changing it to a bright ending is obviously a no-go…” <br /> <br />“Uu…then she saw happy visions in the white powder before ultimately losing her life.” <br /> <br />“That’s not the little match girl, that’s a little cocaine girl!”  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Got it… Then I’ll try reciting this instead.” <br /> <br />With a dissatisfied pout, Ohana took a certain book out of her bag.  <br /> <br />It was the one where she herself got shot down by Colone─[Little Red Riding Hood]. <br /> <br />“Fufufu. No one can withstand the destructive power of this…but there’s one problem.” <br /> <br />I can kind of guess what it is already… <br /> <br />“I start bawling halfway through and can’t finish reciting it.”  <br /> <br />…I suppose so. <br /> <br />“Um… So, I’ll go with ‘red ki✱ne.'” <br /> <br />“What!?!” <br /> <br />“Do you think it would work if I sadly recited the instructions for making ‘red ki✱ne’?” <br /> <br />“There’s no way that would work… I’d like to see someone cry over something like that.” <br /> <br />“But isn’t this the kind of thing that makes you sad? Coming home from the supermarket, taking it out of the bag and─[Oh, it was you… raccoon dog…. Tanuki]” <br /> <br />“You just bought soba noodles by mistake!” <br /> <br />Hopeless… Gotta do something quick. <br /> <br />“Ohana…are you kidding around?” <br /> <br />“No way! I’m seriously trying my best to make Awayuki-san cry!” <br /> <br />But Ohana herself probably sensed she was getting nowhere.  <br /> <br />“Uu…this is bad… Even though I led with the most tear-jerking thing… If this doesn’t work, there’s no hope…” <br /> <br />Your plans were way too low level from the start… <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Gururururururu <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Just then, a stomach growl sounded.  <br /> <br />─Awayuki’s. <br /> <br />“”…………………………”” <br /> <br />Ohana and I exchanged glances─ <br /> <br />“Ahaha! I, I actually haven’t eaten breakfast this morning…!” <br /> <br />Ohana hurriedly covered for her. She’s a girl herself, yet pushing herself… No, I should’ve handled this role considerately─ <br /> <br />“Thank you, Ohana. But actually, that wasn’t my stomach just now, so it’s nothing to be embarrassed about.” <br /> <br />“Huh? …Then what was it?” <br /> <br />“A fart.”  <br /> <br />“That’s 100 times more embarrassing!” <br /> <br />“Kidding. Actually, I’m able to mimic stomach sounds freely. It’s a type of abdominal arts, so to speak.” <br /> <br />“No, that makes it sound wrong… And even if you could, you definitely shouldn’t show that off…since you’re a girl.” <br /> <br />“Oh, then I can make more feminine sounds too.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Gururururururururu! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“You just did an anime voice actor-like rumble!” <br /> <br />“Yeah, so I have free control.” <br /> <br />I thought she could just adjust the timing! Being able to change the sound effects too is way too freeform… <br /> <br />“You don’t seem to mind at all, Tera-san… Then I don’t need to cover for─” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Gurururururururu! <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Just then, a loud stomach growl sounded. <br /> <br />─Ohana’s.  <br /> <br />“Ahaha! The truth is, I only had three bowls of rice for breakfast…!” <br /> <br />“What’s up with your freakish stomach capacity!?” </p>
 
 <p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>
 
 <br />Leaving aside Ohana’s incomprehensible stomach, since Awayuki and I were also getting hungry, we headed to a family restaurant for an early lunch. <br /> <br />“Hey…Awayuki.”  <br /> <br />“Yes’m?” <br /> <br />Along the way, I posed a certain question to Awayuki.  <br /> <br />“Don’t you think…you’re a little too much of a genius?” <br /> <br />Just from what I’ve witnessed directly, there’s cooking, sprinting, calligraphy, sewing, abdominal rumbling techniques.  <br /> <br />The last one is a bit of a different taste, but it’s undoubtedly an ability beyond normal people.  <br /> <br />Meeting her a few days ago and seeing this much means I’ve likely only glimpsed the tip of the iceberg when it comes to Awayuki’s total talent─I can’t quite put it into words, but something about her as a person feels off. <br /> <br />“Let me answer that.” <br /> <br />Seemingly grasping my vague questioning, Awayuki mimed pushing up glasses she wasn’t wearing with a <em>pshi</em>. <br /> <br />“I won’t tell you, Jean.”  <br /> <br />…Hey, how am I supposed to react to such a blatant joke with a straight face? <br /> <br />“Daikyo, you just thought I was joking right?” <br /> <br />“Was it not?” <br /> <br />“I was joking. Sorry, <em>bows</em>”  <br /> <br />No, no need to bow your head so seriously… <br /> <br />“But it’s true I can’t tell you─because even I don’t know.”  <br /> <br />“Huh?” <br /> <br />“It just comes from my brain. Like with math formulas, the solution pops in the instant I see it. So I can’t explain how or why.”  <br /> <br />She doesn’t even have to think for herself? …That’s off the charts…. it’s too different dimension. …… <br /> </p>



<p>“Wait, wait a minute. Hang on… Oh I know! What about memorization-based subjects?  <br /> <br />There’s no way you can remember everything just reading the textbook once, right?” <br /> <br />“I can.” <br /> <br />“You can!?”  <br /> <br />For some reason, I blurted that out in a Kansai dialect. <br /> <br />“Historical eras, figures, events – they rise up in my brain the instant I see them. Then, whatever’s needed comes down when it’s needed.” <br /> <br />I don’t really get what she’s saying… <br /> <br />But well, when it comes to academics in general, I can kinda understand even if I can’t fully comprehend. The problem with Awayuki isn’t just studying. Things involving the body can’t be explained by the brain doing this or that. <br /> <br />“Then what about running super fast? That’s got nothing to do with the brain, right?” <br /> <br />“Nope, it does.”  </p>



<p><br /> <br />Awayuki wagged her upright index finger side to side. <br /> <br />“First, the ideal forms I’ve seen on TV of top athletes rise up. But my physical ability is way too different from a gold medalist. So that form rises back up immediately. Then using that as a base, what needs to be adjusted where so I can achieve maximum speed gets sent down, fine-tuned for each part of my body. Follow those nerve signals, and you’ve got the perfect machine to swap out world’s fastest saba.” <br /> <br />So her brain automatically calculates the optimal form customized for her… Is something like that even possible for a human? <br /> <br />“But, even if that’s possible, there’s no way you’d instantly reach domestic top class just like that, right? That’s way too unrealistic.” <br /> <br />“Totally true. If I went from zero to hero that quick, it’d be straight up magic. If I seriously wanted to get to the top in Japan for sprinting, I’d need to devote at least a year just to that.” <br /> <br />I think getting that far in a year would still be borderline magic… <br /> <br />“For calligraphy, what comes down is specialized brush strokes to mimic the original as much as possible, so on the surface I can reproduce it almost perfectly. But our life experiences and feelings poured into it are worlds apart, so if a pro in the field saw it, they’d probably evaluate it as having zero artistic value.”  <br /> <br />Awayuki says this, but to an amateur eye like mine, it looked exactly like the same person wrote them… Being able to perfectly imitate something on the surface level regardless is still unbelievable. <br /> <br />“It’s a misunderstanding that I’m at the [domestic top class currently in everything]. The truth is [in almost everything, if I try my hardest, I have the potential to reach domestic top class in the future].” <br /> <br />…That’s still plenty abnormal, young lady. <br /> <br />“No, but seriously…this difference between us ordinary people is fundamental, Ohana… Huh, Ohana?” <br /> <br />“Zzz…” <br /> <br />“Hey, you asleep…?” <br /> <br />“She’s asleep.” <br /> <br />“Huh? …What? We’re walking though right now─ Yo, wake up Ohana!” <br /> <br />“Ah! Since you two were having such a complicated talk, I ended up dozing off… Well, it’s pretty common to fall asleep even while walking, right?” <br /> <br />…Is this girl for real? <br /> <br />“While Awayuki’s the opposite, you’re messed up in your own way…” <br /> <br />“Ehehe~” <br /> <br />That wasn’t praise, idiot… <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />After our meal at the family restaurant, we started taking action based on Ohana’s plan. However─ <br /> <br />But… <br /> <br />“Uuueeeeeeeee!” <br /> <br />“Th-this is bad… I’m crying…unintentionally…!” <br /> <br />Even after watching a movie said to make you bawl 100 times. <br /> <br />“………………” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Uguuu…uwaaaaaa!”  <br /> <br />“N-No way…it’s just anime…just a song…ugu…” <br /> <br />Even after listening to a miraculous singer-songwriter Ameoto Namida’s live singing. <br /> <br />“………………” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Uwaaaaaa! I-I should be crying but…somehow I feel refreshed!” <br /> <br />“Uu…guuuuuu! It’s like toxins are being purged from my body!” <br /> <br />Even after undergoing Ultra Detox Namidase Therapy.  <br /> <br />“………………” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Awayuki kept a straight face the whole time.  </p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>◇◆◇◆</strong></p>

<br />“Hey, Awayuki. Going around to all those places today… Didn’t any of it move you?” <br /> <br />As Ohana’s plans ran dry and the sun started setting, I posed a question to Awayuki.  <br /> <br />“Not at all. The movie’s title was true to itself─or rather, it had 113, both big and small, tear-jerking moments. And the singer had a soul-shaking voice. The therapy made scientific sense and didn’t put stress on the body while making you cry, a superb method.” <br /> <br />Well, having it analyzed like that in a straight face… <br /> <br />“Sorry, Ohana, even though you went through all this trouble. And I wasted your day off too, Daikyo. I’m very sorry. <em>bows</em>” <br /> <br />Awayuki gave a perfect 90 degree bow to both me and Ohana. <br /> <br />“N-No no, don’t worry about stuff like that!” <br /> <br />“Yeah. Besides, I had a normal fun time today.”  <br /> <br />“Thank you. But I still think it’s impossible for me to harbor any kind of emotion.” <br /> <br />With a gloomy look─not that her expression changed─Awayuki stated it frankly.  <br /> <br />“Hey, Awayuki… Why do you want to cry so badly in the first place?” <br /> <br />That’s right, we still haven’t asked this most fundamental question. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Because I’m not even born yet.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“─Huh?” <br /> <br />Stunned by the shocking words that suddenly came out, my thoughts froze for an instant. <br /> <br />“Normally, humans are born crying out loud, right?” <br /> <br />“Oh, yeah. There’s that thing called baby’s first cry… Which makes you imagine they’re crying.” <br /> <br />“I didn’t have any of that.” <br /> <br />“I-Is that so…” <br /> <br />“Well, that’s not necessarily crying from sadness, but to breathe. And some babies are extremely quiet, so I’m not the only one. The issue is after that. I’ve never cried. Not just when I came out of my mother’s womb, but in my whole life leading up to now.”  <br /> <br />“Ha? …No no, that can’t be possible. There’s no kid who never cries─” <br /> <br />“There is. And that’s me.” <br /> <br />She wasn’t rebutting my words. Her tone was simply stating the facts. <br /> <br />“And it’s not limited to crying. I told you I don’t have emotions, remember? That’s not a metaphor or exaggeration. In my entire life, I’ve never laughed or gotten angry either─not even once.” <br /> <br />“Wha…” <br /> <br />I had felt she lacked discernable emotion, but that was judging based on Awayuki as she is now. But completely zero since early childhood? …That just can’t be possible as a human. <br /> <br />“It’s possible. Because my brain is made that way.”  <br /> <br />Awayuki seemed to see through what I was thinking and tapped the side of her head with her index finger.  <br /> <br />“Earlier I used expressions like rising up and coming down, but that’s referring to the electrical transmissions between my brain and body. For me, the speed and accuracy is abnormal. My brain is in a constantly fully active state at who knows how many tens or hundreds times normal.” <br /> <br />…So that’s why she has those prodigious talents.  <br /> <br />“But is that okay? With your brain working that intensely, seems like there’d be some kind of toll─” <br /> <br />There I startled at my own words. Could it be─ <br /> <br />“That’s right, Daikyo. My emotions are the toll.” <br /> <br />…No way. <br /> <br />“While my brain works extraordinarily hard, the part that controls emotions, the limbic system, is abnormally silent.”  <br /> <br />“So it’s resting to balance out the other hyperactivity… Is that it?” <br /> <br />“Bingo. When I exhibit some exceptional ability, the already low limbic system brain waves drop even further… With the results being the same no matter how many times it’s measured, I can only think there’s an inversely proportional relationship between my talent and emotions. They say these values are unprecedented in human history. So brain scientists worldwide are all fired up about it.” <br /> <br />[A new possibility in human evolution], huh… <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“It feels like I’m not even alive.” <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“Gh…” <br /> <br />Once again, impactful words coming from Awayuki made me open my eyes wide. <br /> <br />“I understand this is probably when I should feel sad. And this is where I should be crying. But I can’t actually feel sad, or make tears come out.”  <br /> <br />“…………” <br /> <br />“The first emotional expression humans make upon being born into this world is [crying]. Since I haven’t gone through that, my life hasn’t even started yet.”  <br /> <br />…Her words felt somehow paradoxical. <br /> <br />“There’s an American saying that goes: [When you were born, you cried while everyone around you smiled. So live your life in a way that when you die, you’re smiling while everyone around you cries.]─I want that. I want to live a life where people mourn for me with a smile as I die. But my life hasn’t even begun yet. That’s why I want to cry. To start my life by crying first. That’s my dream.” <br /> <br />“Awayuki…” <br /> <br />That’s far too sorrowful to call a dre─ <br /> <br />“Ugu…sob…uwaaaaaa!” <br /> <br />“…Why the heck are you crying Ohana?” <br /> <br />She was quietly listening the whole time, but at some point had started bawling her eyes out.  <br /> <br />“B-Because…this is just…too much… Even though Tera-san always tries her best for others… Why can’t she make even a small wish like this come true…? Tears don’t only come out when you’re sad. Today, I really cried a lot of wonderful, moving tears. If even I can do it… God is so unfair!” <br /> <br />“Ohana…” <br /> <br />“If Tera-san wants to cry, I’ll support you with everything I’ve got! I’ll do anything I can, so…!” <br /> <br />“Thank you, Ohana.”  <br /> <br />Awayuki gently patted Ohana’s head. <br /> <br />“…Awayuki.” <br /> <br />“Yes, Daikyo?” <br /> <br />“How do you see Ohana’s face right now? As objective data devoid of subjectivity.” <br /> <br />“I think it’s dirty.” <br /> <br />“I think so too.”  <br /> <br />“How rude!” <br /> <br />I held back the snarling Ohana as she wiped her tears, and continued.  <br /> <br />“But what if you remove the second half of the question? [How do you see Ohana’s face right now?]” <br /> <br />“I think it’s very beautiful.”  <br /> <br />“I think so too.” <br /> <br />After agreeing, I peered closely at Ohana’s face again.</p>

<p>“She’s an idiot who gets carried away easily, but pure at heart. There aren’t many who’d cry this much for someone they only started talking to properly a few days ago. Even with her face all contorted from crying, those tears are beautiful─and if you can see Ohana’s face now as beautiful, there’s emotion inside you, Awayuki. It just can’t come out.” <br /> <br />“Daikyo-san…” <br /> <br />“Right? What do you think?” <br /> <br />Awayuki tilted her head expressionlessly.  <br /> <br />“Yes.”  <br /> <br />I firmly nodded. No matter how advanced AI becomes, it couldn’t properly understand Ohana’s expression right now.  <br /> <br />“But the reality is we’ve hit a dead end… No matter how much we get fired up to make me cry, it’s meaningless if I can’t come up with a way to output those emotions I have inside.” <br /> <br />“Hmm… You’re right… ……………………………………Ah, I’ve got an idea!” <br /> <br />After pondering deeply for a while, Ohana clapped her hands. <br /> <br />“If just Daikyo and I aren’t enough, we can get everyone to help!” <br /> <br />“Everyone?” <br /> <br />“That’s right, Tera-san. Let’s exercise our [right of assembly]! <br /> <br />Right of assembly? …Oh yeah, I think Ohana was saying something about that being one of the Ten-Sai privileges… But what exactly is that right? <br /> <br />“It’s true I haven’t used my right of assembly yet but… for what?” <br /> <br />“To hold a [Make Tera Awayuki Cry] meeting with the whole school involved! If we dangle the Ten-Sai position as bait, participants will flock in and it’ll be a huge success! No doubt about it!”  <br /> <br />I see… So it’s the right to freely set an agenda and hold a school-wide assembly.  <br /> <br />There was a huge stage on campus too if I remember right… The Principal seems like the event-loving type, so I figured it was for times like that…but it was also because of the Ten-Sai. <br /> <br />“But professional work like today’s movie and therapy didn’t move me. I did have hopes for Teio academy when I decided to enroll, but turns out there are no students with specialized tear-jerking talents. Honestly, I think it would be difficult even if ordinary students without that tried their hardest.” <br /> <br />“Tsk tsk tsk. You don’t get it, Tera-san. An assembly is basically a festival, a festival! Talent or no talent doesn’t matter if everyone gets pumped up. The vibe is key, the air is key! If the whole venue is wrapped in a moving mood, maybe even you could cry, Tera-san!”  <br /> <br />That’s certainly a valid point. <br /> <br />Awayuki’s perspective reflects her tendency to try and understand emotions through logic, but “crying” is not something you can achieve by simply reasoning it out. Sometimes, it’s important to go with the flow and let things happen naturally. <br /> <br />“Besides, today’s movie and therapy session were meant for a general audience. But this gathering is for the sole purpose of making Tera-san cry. The motivation might be to aim for Tenjiku, but that doesn’t matter. What matters is the feeling directed towards it—the sense of presence, the intensity!” <br /> <br />Oh, Ohana is making unexpectedly reasonable points… For an idiot, that’s almost sage-like… <br /> <br />“Daikyo has a face that says [Oh, Ohana is making unexpectedly reasonable points… For an idiot, that’s almost sage-like…]” <br /> <br />“Are you psychic!?”  <br /> <br />“How rude!”  <br /> <br />Ohana and I yelled simultaneously.  <br /> <br />“W-Well, maybe I could’ve worded that better, but I’m totally on board with Ohana’s opinion.” <br /> <br />“Hmm… Certainly, there may be something to it in terms of emotional contagion… Alright. If you both say so, I’ll keep an open mind and think positively about it.” <br /> <br />Still expressionless as ever, but Awayuki nodded up and down as if convinced. <br /> <br />“Yes! With this, hope is in sight, Daikyo-san!” <br /> <br />“Yeah…you’re right.” <br /> <br />…Hm? Why did I just hesitated a little there? <br /> <br />“Huh? What’s wrong? Something on your mind?” <br /> <br />What is it… I don’t have any objection to using the right of assembly, but this feeling like something’s stuck in my chest… <br /> <br />“Nah, it’s nothing. Don’t worry about it.” <br /> <br />No no, we finally have momentum to make Awayuki cry, I can’t rain on the parade─ <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />【Choose 】 <br /> <br />1 Have an erection right here and now <br /> <br />2 Go home and Have an erection at home in front of your mother <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />“May I cry?”</p>
