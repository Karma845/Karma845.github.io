<h1>Chapter 4: Shimizu-san and the Midterm Exam</h1>

<p>About a week before the midterm exams in the afternoon, we of the Astronomy Club were all gathered in our club room, studying.</p>
<p>This study session came together at the suggestion of Ai-san.</p>
<p>The room was arranged with two long tables placed together in the center, surrounded by five chairs.</p>
<p>Sitting across from me was Shimizu-san, to my right was Seto-san, across Seto-san was Ai-san, and to the right of Ai-san from my point of view was Yousuke-san.</p>

<p>“I can’t do this anymore~”</p>

<p>About ten minutes after we started studying, Ai-san was already showing signs of giving up.</p>

<p>“We’ve only just begun. Hang in there.”</p>
<p>“I am trying for the sake of astronomy. It’s just that I can’t seem to get my engine running.”</p>
<p>“Sigh… What can we do to get your ‘engine’ running?”</p>

<p>Yousuke-san asked gently, sighing yet speaking as if talking to a child.</p>

<p>“…You won’t get mad, right?”</p>

<p>Ai-san was cautiously reading Yousuke-san’s expression, like a child asking for a favor from their parent.</p>

<p>“I’d like to say don’t say anything that would make me mad… but if we go that route, we won’t get anywhere with either the conversation or our studying. Anyway, I’ll try my best to stay calm.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Yousuke! So, I’ll just say it! If I do well on this midterm exam… I want some kind of reward!”</p>
<p>“Ai, you..”</p>

<p>Yousuke-san stared at Ai-san with an incredulous look on his face.</p>

<p>“Hey, Yousuke, what’s wrong with your face?”</p>
<p>“Who do you think made me look like this?”</p>
<p>“Yousuke’s mom and dad.”</p>
<p>“We definitely weren’t talking about genetics just now.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san chimed in, apparently unable to hold back.</p>

<p>“First of all, why do I have to give you a reward?”</p>
<p>“Huh? For the sake of astronomy?”</p>
<p>“You’re the one who wants to stargaze, aren’t you?”</p>
<p>“Well, that’s true, but…”</p>
<p>“…sigh.”</p>

<p>Yousuke-san let out another small sigh.</p>

<p>“Can’t be helped. Seeing you unmotivated that might bring down the morale of the other club members. So, for this time, I’ll give in to your request.”</p>
<p>“Yousuke!”</p>

<p>Ai-san’s face brightened instantly.</p>

<p>“But don’t ask for anything too expensive.”</p>
<p>“Of course!”</p>
<p>“So, what’s the target score? At least aim higher than the usual goal set for the student council members.”</p>

<p>The student council members had set exam target scores?</p>
<p>I didn’t know that.</p>

<p>“U-uh, how about ten points more than the goal I usually aim for?”</p>
<p>“Don’t try to score the minimum now. How about thirty points more than your usual goal?”</p>
<p>“Yousuke-san, do you realize I always just barely meet the student council’s target score?”</p>
<p>“I’m the one who always tutors you before exams, so I know that better than anyone else. That’s why I’m saying, if you want a reward from someone, you should strive that much.”</p>
<p>“Muuuu…”</p>

<p>Ai-san stared at Yousuke-san, but it didn’t seem to have any effect.</p>

<p>“Alright. Let’s make it thirty points more than the student council’s usual target score! But when I achieve it, you must give me my reward!”</p>
<p>“Of course. I’ll do whatever I can within my means.”</p>
<p>“Everyone heard that, right? Yousuke said he’d do anything, didn’t he?”</p>
<p>“We heard.”</p>

<p>Seto-san affirmed without changing her expression.</p>

<p>“I said ‘within my means’. Don’t conveniently leave out those words.”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry, I won’t ask for anything unreasonable.”</p>
<p>“Really? Well, if I can’t, I’ll just say no.”</p>

<p>Somehow, I feel like Yousuke-san has a soft spot for Ai-san.</p>

<p>“Alright, now that there’s a reward, I’m three times more motivated! Everyone, let’s study hard for our astronomical observations! Ohhh!”</p>

<p>Ai-san energetically raised her right arm.</p>

<p>“Oooh~”</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>
<p>“Oh!”</p>

<p>Seto-san, Yousuke-san, and I followed by raising our right hands a bit after Ai-san.</p>

<p>“Come on, we should all be following the ‘Oh’ cheer!”</p>
<p>“Who will do that!”</p>

<p>It seemed like Shimizu-san was a bit embarrassed to do that.</p>

<p>“Kei, you’re such a shy person. Well, never mind. Let’s resume our study session!”</p>

<p>At that cue, everyone’s eyes returned to their textbooks and notes.</p>

<p>“Hondō-kun, can I speak with you?”</p>
<p>“What’s wrong, Seto-san?”</p>

<p>About thirty minutes after we resumed studying, Seto-san approached me.</p>

<p>“I have a section I don’t understand and I’d like your help.”</p>
<p>“I’m fine with that, but maybe asking Yousuke-san or Ai-san would be better…”</p>

<p>Looking over at Yousuke-san and Ai-san, it seemed Yousuke-san was in the middle of explaining something to Ai-san.</p>
<p>Aside from me, Seto-san could ask Shimizu-san, but maybe she’s still not comfortable with Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“It’s a bit hard to approach Ai-senpai and Sakata-senpai right now.”</p>
<p>“I see. I’ll help as much as I can.”</p>
<p>“Thank you. The part I don’t understand is…”</p>
<p>(TN: His name is Yousuke Sakata.)</p>

<p>Luckily, Seto-san’s question was one that I could somehow explain.</p>

<p>“You see, it was like this…”</p>

<p>As I was explaining using the textbook and notes to Seto-san, I felt someone’s gaze on me from somewhere.</p>
<p>I looked around, but no one was looking in my direction.</p>

<p>“Hondō-kun, is something wrong?”</p>
<p>“No, it seemed like my imagination. Let me continue explaining.”</p>

<p>As I resumed my explanation, again, I felt like someone was watching me.</p>
<p>I quickly scanned the surroundings and our eyes met——it was Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, what’s wrong?”</p>
<p>“It-It’s nothing!”</p>
<p>“Is that so?”</p>
<p>“Hondō-kun, please continue explaining.”</p>
<p>“Alright. So, this part is…”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san herself said it was nothing, so maybe her looking my way was just a coincidence.</p>
<p>I began explaining to Seto-san once more.</p>

<p>“I understand now. Thank you, Hondō-kun.”</p>
<p>“I’m glad I could help.”</p>

<p>Seto-san grasped the concept quickly, so the explanation finished sooner than I anticipated.</p>

<p>“Can I ask again if I come across another section I don’t understand?”</p>
<p>“As long as I can explain it, it’s fine.”</p>
<p>“Got it. Thanks again.”</p>
<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>With that, Seto-san and I returned to our respective study preparations.</p>

<p>“Kei-san, you look scary?” (TN: Text in image.)</p>
<p>“…I’m not.”</p>
<p>“You were. You looked like a demon, I even checked if you had grown horns.”</p>
<p>“It’s a shame they weren’t there. If they were, I would’ve headbutted you.”</p>
<p>“Planning to put a hole in my face, huh?”</p>

<p>Seems Yousuke’s guidance had finished, as now a comedic banter between Ai-san and Shimizu-san began.</p>

<p>“Kei is getting jealous, how cute.”</p>
<p>“…I’m not jealous.”</p>
<p>“You are. Right, Yousuke?”</p>
<p>“If you have time to say that, you should be studying.”</p>

<p>Despite what Yousuke said, he didn’t deny it.</p>
<p>Glancing over at Shimizu-san, she was glaring at Yousuke, and he was avoiding her gaze.</p>
<p>I felt it was best to return my focus to my notes.</p>

<p>“You should just be honest.”</p>
<p>“S-shut up.”</p>
<p>“Well, if it was easy, you wouldn’t be struggling, huh?”</p>
<p>“I’ll hit you.”</p>
<p>“Oh, so scary~ Then Onee-chan will return to studying.”</p>

<p>The sisters’ conversation seemed to end, and silence once again enveloped the room.</p>


<p>(Hmm, how do I solve this problem?)</p>

<p>After some time had passed in the quiet room, I stumbled on a problem.</p>
<p>I reviewed my textbooks and notes, but I just couldn’t figure out how to solve it.</p>

<p>(At this rate, I’m getting nowhere. I should ask someone.)</p>

<p>Luckily, no one was talking, so anyone would likely help.</p>
<p>After a bit of thought, I decided to approach someone.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, do you have a moment?”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“I have a problem I can’t solve. Can you help me?”</p>
<p>“Why me? Yousuke, who’s smarter than me right now, is free.”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san unexpectedly mentioned Yousuke-san, who then looked our way.</p>

<p>“Don’t say I’m free, I’m studying for the exam. Of course, if you have a problem you don’t understand, I can help you if you want it.”</p>
<p>“Hey, Yousuke! Why are you acting like a kind senpai now? This isn’t the time for that!”</p>
<p>“S-sorry…”</p>

<p>For some reason, Yousuke-san was being scolded by Ai-san for an unreasonable reason.</p>

<p>“I just…felt like I could rely on Shimizu-san… Am I bothering you?”</p>
<p>“I-I didn’t say it was that much! Just tell me, what don’t you understand?”</p>
<p>“Um, this problem right here…”</p>
<p>“…hey, why are you smirking, Ai?”</p>

<p>Looking over at Ai-san, she indeed had a lukewarm smile on her face as she gazed at Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“Why not change seats? It’ll be hard for both of you to teach and learn from where you are now, right?”</p>

<p>It’s true that Shimizu-san is sitting opposite me right now, and I think it would be easier if she were beside me.</p>

<p>“In that case, I’ll switch seats with Shimizu-san.”</p>

<p>The one offering to switch was Seto-san, who was seated next to me.</p>

<p>“Is that okay, Seto-san?”</p>
<p>“It’s fine. If I don’t understand something, I’ll ask Ai Sen——I’ll ask Sakata Senpai sitting next to Ai Senpai.”</p>
<p>“Um, Mio-chan? Remember, I’m a third-year. I studied your exam content a year ago.”</p>
<p>“Having studied it and being able to teach it are different things.”</p>
<p>“Oof… That’s a good blow. I’ll let it slide for today…”</p>
<p>“Let’s switch seats, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“Alright.”</p>

<p>And so, Shimizu-san moved to the seat next to me and Seto-san to the one next to Ai-san.</p>

<p>“Then, Shimizu-san, thank you.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>
<p>“Like I said earlier, I don’t understand this problem.”</p>
<p>“That problem? It’s…”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san used the textbook to explain the problem I didn’t understand clearly.</p>
<p>While Shimizu-san occasionally skips classes, it doesn’t mean she’s bad at studying.</p>
<p>As evidence, I’ve never seen Shimizu-san being called out by a teacher because of test scores.</p>
<p>She probably studies diligently at home.</p>

<p>“… then you can arrive at the answer. Got it?”</p>
<p>“Yes, thank you, Shimizu-san. That was easy to understand.”</p>
<p>“It wasn’t that difficult of a problem…Anything else you don’t understand?”</p>
<p>“Hm? Let me see, just give me a moment.”</p>

<p>As I looked through the problems in the textbook, I found another one I couldn’t solve.</p>

<p>“I don’t understand this problem either. Can you help me?”</p>
<p>“That problem is…”</p>

<p>To look at the textbook, Shimizu-san leans closer to me.</p>
<p>Her face is quite close to mine.</p>

<p>“Uh, Shimizu-san? Aren’t you a bit too close?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Ah…”</p>

<p>It seems Shimizu-san only just realized and hastily moved back.</p>
<p>It appears she was unconsciously leaning in.</p>

<p>“Sorry… I was just focused on the textbook…”</p>
<p>“I should apologize too. I should’ve moved the textbook closer to you.”</p>

<p>Maybe it’s because summer is slowly approaching, but my face feels hot.</p>
<p>As I thought that, I again felt someone’s gaze on me.</p>
<p>Checking around, this time it wasn’t Shimizu-san looking.</p>

<p>“Why are you looking this way, Ai-san?”</p>
<p>“It’s cute, very cute…”</p>
<p>“You’re annoying me, get out of the room.”</p>

<p>With just one word from Ai-san, Shimizu-san seemed ready to fight.</p>

<p>“Oh come on, I was just touched by the two of you being so naive and cute! I couldn’t help but comment like that!”</p>
<p>“That’s exactly what’s annoying me!”</p>
<p>“Calm down, Kei. It’s not like Ai said it with ill intent… No, on second thought, that’s still not okay.”</p>
<p>“If you’re going to back me up, then do it all the way, okay?”</p>
<p>“Sorry, Ai. I can’t help you out on this.”</p>
<p>“Don’t just give up so easily!”</p>
<p>“Come on, hurry up and get out in the hallway.”</p>
<p>“Hey! You’re really mad, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>Even to me, Shimizu-san’s glare seemed sharper than ever.</p>

<p>“I’m sorry! It was my fault! I’m very sorry!”</p>

<p>Ai-san clasped her hands in front of her face, apologizing to Shimizu-san.</p>
<p>For a brief moment, Shimizu-san glanced at me for some reason before turning her gaze back to Ai-san.</p>

<p>“…There won’t be a next time.”</p>
<p>“Thank you so much!”</p>

<p>It seems the conflict between the Shimizu sisters ended without any actual fighting.</p>

<p>“…Hondō.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>
<p>“We’re continuing. Tell me what you don’t understand.”</p>
<p>“Okay.”</p>

<p>From then on, without any major issues, we of the Astronomy Club continued our exam preparations while taking breaks every now and then.</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“Alright, it’s getting late. Let’s wrap up today’s study session.”</p>

<p>Just as I thought it might be time to head home, Yousuke-san said that.</p>

<p>“That was long. I feel like I’ve studied for a lifetime.”</p>

<p>Ai-san slumped over her desk, as if the strings of a puppet had suddenly been cut.</p>

<p>“Well, for Ai, you did work hard for quite a long time.”</p>
<p>“Right?! With this, I’m sure I’ll get perfect scores in all subjects on the test!”</p>
<p>“Don’t get too ahead of yourself. Your reward isn’t confirmed yet, so keep studying hard at home.”</p>
<p>“What? Do you want me to study at home too? …Well, for a reward, I guess I’ll do my best!”</p>

<p>It seems Ai-san’s motivation greatly improves with the promise of a reward.</p>


<p>“Ah, I just had a great idea!”</p>
<p>“…I have a bad feeling about this.”</p>
<p>“Why?! It really is a good idea! Oh, but maybe Yousuke has nothing to do with it.”</p>
<p>“Then I’m relieved. Just don’t bother the juniors.”</p>
<p>“Yousuke is so rude…Anyway, my cute junior friends, please listen to what I have to say.”</p>
<p>“What is it?”</p>

<p>I turned my face towards Ai-san to listen.</p>

<p>“Um, I know Daiki-kun is listening, but why are the rest of the cute juniors silently packing up their textbooks and notes?”</p>
<p>“Listening to you is probably a waste of time.”</p>
<p>“I agree. It’s recommended to ignore Ai-senpai at times like this.”</p>
<p>“Are you trying to make me cry?”</p>

<p>I felt that if this continued, Ai-san might genuinely start crying.</p>
<p>As I was thinking of a way to handle the situation, Yousuke-san spoke up.</p>

<p>“Ai, tell us what you want before you cry. Kei and Seto will at least listen to what you have to say.”</p>
<p>“…Keep it short and clear. We’re about to leave.”</p>
<p>“If Sakata-senpai says so, then it can’t be helped. What did you want to say, Ai-senpai?”</p>
<p>“Kei, Mio-chan…”</p>

<p>Ai-san looked touched.</p>
<p>With just a word from Yousuke-senpai, both Shimizu-san and Seto-san were ready to listen.</p>
<p>Perhaps being the student council president, Yousuke-senpai is adept at influencing others.</p>

<p>“Now, for the announcement! To the junior who achieves the best overall score in the upcoming midterm exams… I want to give a reward! Yay!”</p>
<p>“…You’re the only one excited. Are you okay?”</p>
<p>“That’s not true… Wait, it is true. Everyone is surprisingly calm…”</p>

<p>Both Shimizu-san and Seto-san, who had stopped to listen, resumed packing up their textbooks and notes.</p>

<p>“Kei, why are you so cold?!”</p>
<p>“Whatever reward you’re offering is probably isn’t that great.”</p>
<p>“Such overwhelming distrust… Seto-chan doesn’t think that way about me, right?”</p>
<p>“Of course I do.”</p>
<p>“Isn’t there anyone who believes in me? Daiki-kun, you’d be excited about a reward from me, right?”</p>

<p>It seemed like Ai-san’s eyes were slightly teary.</p>

<p>“Uh, yes. I think I’d be happy.”</p>

<p>I generally wouldn’t mind receiving something from someone, so it’s not exactly a lie.</p>

<p>“See! (ジーン !) I knew it!”</p>

<p>This might be the first time I’ve seen someone so moved that they exclaimed ‘(ジーン !)’</p>

<p>“Did you hear that, Kei and Mio-chan? Daiki-kun said he’d be happy with any reward from me!”</p>
<p>“He didn’t say ‘any’…”</p>
<p>“Well, I won’t be giving rewards to Kei or Seto anymore! Only Daiki-kun will get one!”</p>
<p>“I don’t really care, but what exactly is the reward?”</p>
<p>“Oh, I forgot to mention that!”</p>

<p>Indeed, she hadn’t explained the specifics of the reward.</p>

<p>“The reward is… the right to have one wish granted!”</p>
<p>“Ha?”</p>
<p>“Huh?”</p>
<p>“What?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san, Seto-san, and I all voiced our surprise almost simultaneously.</p>

<p>“Ai, what did you just say?”</p>
<p>“Oh, are you getting interested? Then listen carefully, I’ll say it again! The reward from me is the right to have one wish granted!”</p>
<p>“Hey, Ai. Are you sure you want to go that far?”</p>

<p>Yousuke-san looked at Ai-san with concern.</p>

<p>“It’s fine, Yousuke. All of our juniors are good kids, and they wouldn’t make a wish that would put me in a tight spot.”</p>
<p>“That may be true, but…”</p>
<p>“Ai Senpai, I have a question.”</p>

<p>Seto-san raised her hand gracefully.</p>

<p>“Oh, what is it, Mio-chan?”</p>
<p>“If I have that reward, would it be possible to have you treat me to a convenience store exclusive dorayaki filled with fresh cream?”</p>
<p>“That’s a simple request.”</p>
<p>“And a set with the convenience store exclusive matcha dorayaki?”</p>
<p>“Of course… but don’t you think you’re a little too fond of dorayaki?”</p>

<p>I thought the same thing as Ai-san.</p>
<p>I guess Seto-san really loves dorayaki that much.</p>

<p>“Dorayaki is delicious, so it can’t be helped. Alright, I’ll participate too.”</p>
<p>“Great! Another participant secured. Look, there are already two of them, so there’s only one spot left for participants on a first-come basis! Hurry!”</p>

<p>By ‘two people,’ it seems I’m already being counted as a participant.</p>

<p>“To begin with, aren’t I the only one left who can participate? …Anyway, there’s nothing I want you to do for me. I’ve finished cleaning up, so I’m going home.”</p>
<p>“…Are you sure about that?”</p>
<p>“What do you mean?”</p>
<p>“I’m saying there might be something you desire that I can help with.”</p>

<p>Ai-san puffed out her chest.</p>
<p>My gaze almost inadvertently dropped to her chest, so I quickly looked away.</p>

<p>“… What ‘desire’ are you talking about? Tell me.”</p>
<p>“Then, please lend me your ear for a moment.”</p>

<p>After saying that, Ai-san moved beside Shimizu-san and whispered something in her ear for a few seconds.</p>

<p>“Wha…”</p>
<p>“What do you think? I believe it’s not a bad deal for Kei either.”</p>
<p>“Ugh…”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san seemed to be struggling quite a bit.</p>

<p>“…Fine. I’ll take on that challenge. But if you say it, you better make sure it happens!”</p>
<p>“Of course! With that, everyone’s participation is decided!”</p>

<p>Thus, the three of us decided to compete in the midterm exam’s total scores for Ai-san’s reward.</p>
<p>Come to think of it, I hadn’t stated my wish yet.</p>
<p>Is that okay?</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>When I arrived in the classroom on the morning of the first day of midterm exams, many students were already there.</p>
<p>There were those who had studied enough and felt confident, those who hadn’t studied much and tried to distract themselves by discussing their anxieties with friends, and those who were engrossed in their textbooks without talking to anyone.</p>

<p>“Hey, Daiki.”</p>
<p>“Good morning, Toshiya.”</p>
<p>“Good morning. Did you study enough, Daiki?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, I believe I did more than usual. What about you, Toshiya?”</p>
<p>“I went about it as usual.”</p>

<p>Toshiya’s ‘usual’ means he hardly studies anything other than his assignments.</p>
<p>If it were any other friend, I’d be worried, but with Toshiya, I feel he’ll be okay.</p>
<p>In fact, with that amount of study, Toshiya always scores higher than me in exams.</p>

<p>“By the way, I heard from Seto-san that the Astronomy Club had a study session. It must’ve been nice to study with Seto-san… If it were me, I could study for hours.”</p>
<p>“Hahaha…”</p>

<p>I couldn’t help but give a wry smile.</p>
<p>Indeed, if the condition was studying with Seto-san, Toshiya would probably be eager to study every day.</p>

<p>“Also, I heard that the one with the best grades among the second-year students of the Astronomy Club gets to have a wish granted by Ai-san?”</p>
<p>“Seto-san mentioned that?”</p>
<p>“Yeah, Seto-san was unusually enthusiastic. She said she wanted Ai-san to treat her to dorayaki. She looked so cute I wanted to buy her dorayaki myself.”</p>

<p>I always have to be on guard around my surrounding because Toshiya’s love-struck comment about Seto-san might slip out to others. I had forgotten to be careful and quickly scanned the surroundings.</p>
<p>Fortunately, everyone was talking about the exam, and it seemed they hadn’t heard our conversation.</p>

<p>“So, Daiki, if you happened to have the best score among the Astronomy Club members, what would you ask Ai-san for?”</p>
<p>“Me?”</p>
<p>“That face of yours looks like you haven’t thought about it at all. Then why did you study more than usual this time, Daiki?”</p>
<p>“Huh? Because the Astronomy Club needs to rank within the top forty for stargazing…”</p>
<p>“That’s for the Astronomy Club, isn’t it? Don’t you have something personal you want? Like, remember when you mentioned wanting a homemade bentō?”</p>
<p>“I pretty much got that wish already…”</p>
<p>“What do you mean you got that wish?”</p>
<p>“Didn’t I tell you, Toshiya? I forgot my lunch money a while ago and got a bentō from Shimizu-san when you was away for a meeting.”</p>

<p>It was a coincidence, but there was a time when I forgot my lunch money and Shimizu-san gave me a homemade bentō.</p>
<p>Because of that, I don’t really feel the urge to have one anymore.</p>

<p>“…I see. So that happened when I wasn’t around. Still, Daiki, it’s like you don’t have desires or something like that. Normally, if Ai-san said she’d grant a wish, the other guys wouldn’t be so quiet. Well, I’m not interested though.”</p>
<p>“I always feel guilty asking people to do things for me.”</p>
<p>“That might be both your strong and weak point, Daiki. It’s okay to accept kindness from those you know a little more lightly.”</p>

<p>It seems Toshiya is concerned about me in his own way.</p>

<p>“…I guess you’re right. If I get the best score among the second-year students in the Astronomy Club, I’ll think about the reward.”</p>
<p>“That’s the spirit! It’s better for people to have many dreams they want to achieve!”</p>

<p>A typical Toshiya-esque statement, always eager to discuss about dreams.</p>

<p>“By the way, changing the topic slightly, do you know about the recent rumors concerning Shimizu-san?”</p>
<p>“I don’t. Did Shimizu-san do something?”</p>
<p>“Don’t worry. It’s not a bad rumor. Shimizu-san in the staff room——”</p>

<p>Before Toshiya could finish, the door at the back of the classroom slowly opened.</p>

<p>“Hm? Someone’s here? …Sorry, Daiki, I’d better go now.”</p>

<p>With that, Toshiya returned to his seat.</p>
<p>In his place, a certain individual slowly approached my desk.</p>

<p>“G-good morning, Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“…Morning.”</p>

<p>It was Shimizu-san, or more precisely, Shimizu-san enveloped in a deep, dark aura.</p>

<p>“Doesn’t Shimizu-san look more intimidating than usual today?”</p>
<p>“Hey, she can hear you. I didn’t say anything. If anything happens, it’s all on you.”</p>
<p>“Heartless! I swear, if something happens, I’m dragging you down with me!”</p>

<p>Clearly, Shimizu-san was behaving differently than usual, and most of our classmates were fixated on her.</p>
<p>She neither shouted nor ignored our classmates, just gave them a brief glance.</p>

<p>“Eek!”</p>

<p>An unknown scream could be heard.</p>
<p>Shimizu-san’s eyes were devoid of any light.</p>
<p>What was there was overwhelmingly terrifying, dark, and empty eyes.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san, are you okay?”</p>
<p>“…Yeah.”</p>

<p>It took her some time, but she did respond.</p>
<p>Still, looking into those eyes, I couldn’t help but worry.</p>

<p>“Really? If so, that’s good… but maybe you should go home early later and get some rest today?”</p>
<p>“…Okay.”</p>

<p>While they were having this conversation, the bell rang, and Yuasa Sensei entered the classroom.</p>

<p>“Let’s all do our best on the midterm exams.”</p>

<p>Upon hearing the words ‘midterm exams,’ for a brief moment, it seemed like a spark of life returned to Shimizu-san’s eyes.</p>

<p>“…This midterm, I won’t lose to you or Seto.”</p>
<p>“Huh? Okay.”</p>

<p>Could it be that Shimizu-san’s odd behavior was because of the midterm exams?</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>For the next few days, our class took the exams amidst unusual tension.</p>
<p>Most classmates, including Toshiya, wished for the exam period to end quickly and to be free from Shimizu-san’s oppressive aura.</p>
<p>On the other hand, I continued with the exams while constantly thinking about Shimizu-san.</p>
<p>Thanks to study sessions at the Astronomy Club, I felt more confident than usual.</p>

<p>By the end of the last subject on the final day of exams, the pressure from Shimizu-san had noticeably decreased.</p>
<p>Toshiya later mentioned that at the moment the exams ended, the relief from the dual pressures of the exams and Shimizu-san was palpable among many classmates.</p>
<p>I, too, felt greatly relieved seeing Shimizu-san return to her usual self.</p>

<p>While the other classmates discussed their exam performances, Shimizu-san had somehow finished preparing to leave.</p>

<p>“Goodbye, see you tomorrow.”</p>

<p>Perhaps she was too preoccupied with something to respond. I didn’t get a reply from Shimizu-san.</p>
<p>I thought about heading home, but I decided to stop by the Astronomy Club first because I had some spare time.</p>

<p>“Hello…”</p>
<p>“Shh, be quiet.”</p>

<p>As I tried to greet and enter the Astronomy Club’s room, Yousuke-san stopped me.</p>
<p>Apparently, I shouldn’t raise my voice right now.</p>

<p>“What’s going on?”</p>

<p>Instead of speaking, Yousuke-san pointed inside the room.</p>
<p>When I looked carefully, I saw two figures lying face down on a desk.</p>
<p>Their faces were hidden, but I could easily imagine that they were Shimizu-san and Ai-san based on their hairstyles and clothing.</p>

<p>Yousuke-san pointed to the door, suggesting he wanted to talk in the hallway without waking them up. I nodded in agreement.</p>
<p>Once we were in the hallway, Yousuke-san finally spoke.</p>

<p>“They both came in and fell asleep immediately. They must’ve been exhausted.”</p>
<p>“I thought Shimizu-san had gone home.”</p>
<p>“She might not have had the energy to. She probably worked hard for this midterm.”</p>
<p>“She must’ve been studying hard outside of our study sessions too.”</p>
<p>“Yes, when Kei couldn’t understand something, she apparently went to the staff room to ask, and it became a topic among the teachers.”</p>
<p>“Shimizu-san…”</p>

<p>The usual Shimizu-san probably wouldn’t go to such lengths. It seems that she gave this midterm her best.</p>

<p>“I hope our stargazing will be realized, especially after the two of them have worked so hard for it.”</p>
<p>“I hope so.”</p>

<p>After that, Yousuke-san and I continued to chat in the hallway until the Shimizu sisters woke up.</p>


<p>“We have a major announcement today!”</p>

<p>About two weeks after the midterms, with all the club members gathered in the room, Ai-san suddenly exclaimed with enthusiasm.</p>

<p>“What is it? Speak quickly.”</p>
<p>“Don’t rush me. I just received a report from Yuasa Sensei… Since all the Astronomy Club members ranked within the top forty overall, we’ve been officially granted permission for rooftop stargazing! Yay!”</p>

<p>Ai-san was jumping up and down with joy.</p>

<p>“Congratulations!”</p>
<p>“Well done, Ai-senpai!”</p>
<p>“Thank you, my dear juniors! Wait, aren’t we missing one voice from my dear juniors?”</p>

<p>Ai-san stares at Shimizu-san.</p>

<p>“…Well, that’s good, isn’t it?”</p>
<p>“Wow! Even Kei says so! Onee-chan is so touched!”</p>
<p>“Annoying. I shouldn’t have said anything.”</p>
<p>“Don’t be like that, Kei. Your efforts played a big part in realizing this stargazing event, you know?”</p>
<p>“Huh? I didn’t do anything.”</p>
<p>“You went to ask the teachers questions. Apparently, that left a good impression on them.”</p>

<p>It seems Shimizu-san’s efforts unexpectedly bore fruit.</p>

<p>“…I didn’t go ask questions just to leave a good impression.”</p>
<p>“That’s probably why it worked out even better. Of course it’s thanks to Mio-chan and Daiki-kun’s hard work too! Yuasa Sensei praised the two of you for your improved grades and was happy!”</p>

<p>Hearing that made me relieved.</p>
<p>It seems I could contribute a bit to the Astronomy Club’s success.</p>

<p>“That’s why, we’re planning to decide on the date for stargazing soon after keeping an eye on the weather. If anyone has plans on the proposed dates, please let me know in advance. That concludes our stargazing discussion! Let’s move on to the next topic.”</p>
<p>“There’s more to discuss…?”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san looked at Ai-san with an exasperated expression.</p>

<p>“Next up is the reward everyone has been looking forward to. First up is me!”</p>
<p>“You?”</p>
<p>“While the student council officers aimed for a total score increase of thirty points for mission completion, the result is…”</p>
<p>“Get to the point. Just say it.”</p>
<p>“I did it! Mission accomplished!”</p>

<p>Ai-san thrust her right arm energetically upwards, expressing her joy.</p>
<p>Seeing this, Yousuke-san gently smiled and applauded for Ai-san.</p>

<p>“Congratulations on achieving your goal. Well, Ai did work exceptionally hard for this exam. Let me know later what you want as a reward or if there’s something specific you desire.”</p>
<p>“Thank you, Yousuke! Be prepared to give me my reward later!”</p>
<p>“I’d appreciate it if you could tell me what the reward is in advance.”</p>
<p>“That’s a surprise for later! Now, let’s move on to the much-anticipated reward for the juniors! Everyone, you already know your overall rank from the midterm exams, right? Let’s share our ranks one by one and see who’s on top! By the way, I ranked eighteenth this time! Impressive, right?”</p>

<p>That’s true, ranked in the eighteenth is quite high.</p>
<p>It seems Ai-san must have studied quite hard.</p>

<p>“Don’t suddenly brag about it.”</p>
<p>“I don’t want to hear that from the first ranker, Yousuke.”</p>
<p>“How do you even know my rank…”</p>
<p>“The teacher praised you in class. This Ai-chan has very sharp ears.”</p>
<p>“Those devilish ears…”</p>
<p>“It’s your bad luck to have talk about it near me. Anyway, who wants to announce their rank first?”</p>
<p>“I’ll do it.”</p>

<p>Surprisingly, the one who raised her hand was Seto-san.</p>

<p>“Oh, nice one, Mio-chan!”</p>
<p>“I worked hard for the dorayaki.”</p>
<p>“I see, such dedication to dorayaki is commendable. What’s your rank, Mio-chan?”</p>
<p>“Thirty-third.”</p>
<p>“Wow! Your hard work paid off!”</p>

<p>Judging by Ai-san’s reaction, it seems Seto-san’s score was better than usual.</p>

<p>“Alright, who’s next to share their rank?”</p>

<p>It appears Shimizu-san isn’t ready to speak yet.</p>

<p>“Then, can I go ahead?”</p>
<p>“Of course! What’s your rank, Daiki-kun?”</p>
<p>“…I’m ranked twenty-seventh.”</p>
<p>“This is it! Mio-chan narrowly loses!”</p>
<p>“So close…”</p>

<p>Seto-san’s expression seems normal, but upon closer inspection, she appears slightly disheartened.</p>

<p>“Now, only Kei is left! Will it be Daiki-kun who wins, or will it be Kei? It’s the final battle!”</p>

<p>The excitement has reached its peak.</p>
<p>Although it seems like Ai-san might be the only one truly excited.</p>

<p>“So Kei, what’s your rank?”</p>
<p>“…th place.”</p>

<p>Her voice was so soft that her rank was inaudible for me.</p>
<p>It seemed to be the same for everyone else.</p>

<p>“Sorry? Could you please say that again?”</p>
<p>“…Third place!”</p>

<p>Shimizu-san announced her rank loudly enough for it to echo down the hallway.</p>

<p>“What?! The rankings are set! The winner is Kei Shimizu! A dominating victory, far ahead of second place Daiki-kun!”</p>

<p>Ai-san is buzzing with excitement.</p>
<p>Honestly, I was quite surprised to hear third place too.</p>

<p>“Congratulations, Kei. I’ll present you with a victory hug!”</p>
<p>“I don’t want it. Just make sure to give me the proper reward.”</p>
<p>“You don’t want my hug… Oh, you mean you want to hug when it’s just the two of us? Or perhaps with Daiki-kun instead…”</p>
<p>“If you say another word, I won’t guarantee your safety.”</p>
<p>“I’ll stay quiet!”</p>

<p>What was Ai-san about to say?</p>

<p>“Fine then, I’m leaving now.”</p>
<p>“What?! You’re leaving already?”</p>
<p>“I’m very tired today.”</p>

<p>With that, Shimizu-san picked up her bag and started walking towards the door.</p>

<p>“Shimizu-san.”</p>
<p>“What, what is it?”</p>
<p>“Congratulations on getting third place in the midterms. Shimizu-san, you really are amazing.”</p>
<p>“Wha… What are you talking about? …I’m going home.”</p>
<p>“Okay, see you tomorrow.”</p>

<p>When she opened the door, Shimizu-san’s face seemed a tad red.</p>
<p>Was it just my imagination?</p>

<p>***</p>

<p>“Alright!”</p>

<p>Once I got home and was in my room, I struck a triumphant pose, savoring my joy.</p>
<p>It’s not like I usually slacked off during exams, but my serious approach to this midterm was sparked by one comment from Ai.</p>

<p>『If you get the best grade among the second-year students in the Astronomy Club for the midterms, I’ll make sure you get a perfect moment alone with Daiki-kun during our stargazing.』</p>

<p>Those words were too enticing for me.</p>
<p>Even considering it was a remark by the playful Ai, it was enough reason for me to work hard.</p>

<p>“…hmmph, If there’s no reward as promised, I won’t forgive her.”</p>

<p>The decisive day will be the day of the stargazing event. There, I’ll create unforgettable memories with Hondō.</p>
<p>I made up my mind.</p>
