<h2>Chapter 6: Love Grows in Time We Don’t See Each Other, and So Does the Devil</h2>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>1</strong></p>


<p>After parting ways with everyone, Yorka and I decided to spend a little more time together. Instead of heading to a café, since we were already full from singing and drinking, we opted for a casual stroll around the station to refresh ourselves after being in a confined space for so long.</p>



<p>“I’m tired,” Yorka sighed, releasing the tension from her shoulders once we were alone. It seemed she had been quite nervous.</p>



<p>“Good job today. How was it?” </p>



<p>“Karaoke was fun. But I’m still not used to large groups yet.”</p>



<p><em>Not yet. </em>I could feel Yorka’s positivity.</p>



<p>“By the way, about that Sena Club gathering… are you okay with it?”</p>



<p>“Why are you blushing, Kisumi?”</p>



<p>“Being part of a group with my own name feels embarrassing,” I answered honestly.</p>



<p>“The name is simple and easy to understand, isn’t it?”</p>



<p>“…Yorka, are you finding this amusing?”</p>



<p>“I genuinely think it’s a good idea. If it involves Kisumi and Hinaka-chan, it’s easy for me to join.”</p>



<p>“As long as it’s not a burden for you.”</p>



<p>“I’m fine. I’ll decline right away if it’s too much. But, I like being with just the two of us the most.”</p>



<p>Yorka’s fingertips subtly traced over my hand. Taking it as a cue, I held her hand. Walking hand in hand with my girlfriend made even familiar childhood landscapes look different.</p>



<p>“Coincidentally, I used to attend a cram school in that building for exam prep. It was a small, privately-owned place. But there was this fascinating part-time lecturer.”</p>



<p>“Hmm, are they male?”</p>



<p>It was rare how Yorka’s intuition was off. I guess she was really tired from karaoke.</p>



<p>“No, it’s female. She was a university student majoring in science, always wearing a lab coat and sandals. She’d tie her long hair into a bun with a pen instead of a hairpin. Maybe she found makeup bothersome, so she stayed bare-faced and wore a mask all year round. Is that what they call a genius? She was quite interesting.” I shared my memory.</p>



<p>“I can’t believe she managed to get you pass the exam with such a laid-back approach.”</p>



<p>“At that time, she was like the terrifying Demon Lord to me. She has this Spartan style with outrageous demands, but her brain worked incredibly fast. She was good at teaching.” I could laugh about it now because I had passed the exam, but back then, it was seriously tough. It was a daily grind of studies, with her cheerfully bombarding with assignments while saying, ‘<em>Alright, Sumi-kun, solve this next.’</em></p>



<p>“Well, since she’s your benefactor, I’ll let it slide this time.”</p>



<p>“I’m grateful for having such a tolerant girlfriend.”</p>



<p>“I’d get tired if I doubted you every time. “</p>



<p>“Don’t worry, there’s no one else for me but Yorka.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I know.” Yorka wore a relaxed smile as if it were a given.</p>



<p>“But… it still feels lacking.”</p>



<p>“Huh, what does?”</p>



<p>“…I want to hug you, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>“Here?”</p>



<p>It would be awkward to embrace in the middle of the street. What to do? I wanted to fulfill her request. Heck, I wanted that too. But where could we find a spot away from prying eyes? How did other couples handle this?</p>



<p>Maybe just hug without caring about others? I recalled seeing a drunken college couple kissing passionately near the station gates. However, we were high school students, and throwing off inhibitions under the influence of alcohol was not only inappropriate but also illegal.</p>



<p>Was there no suitable place? Oh, right, a private room at a manga cafe would allow us some privacy without worrying about onlookers.</p>



<p>Wait, are we really going to a manga cafe just to hug!? Maybe it’s better to invite her over to my place again? No, today both my parents were home. Introducing her to them abruptly was a hurdle in various ways.</p>



<p>While I was pondering, Yorka grabbed my hand. “Over there.”</p>



<p>She led me down a side street. As we ventured into a narrower alley, the side of a vending machine provided a blind spot. Here, we’d be less likely to attract attention.</p>



<p>“For today’s reward. And… an advance for later.” As if it were the most natural thing, Yorka hugged me. She wrapped her arms around me and pressed her whole body against mine.</p>



<p><em>The usually shy Yorka is being surprisingly bold!</em> I internally celebrated but held back to not spoil the moment.</p>



<p>“Feel free to have as much as you want.”</p>



<p>“Yeah. Kisumi is warm.”</p>



<p>“Well, that’s because I’m alive.”</p>



<p>“It would be inconvenient if you weren’t.”</p>



<p>I gently ran my fingers through Yorka’s hair. It was soft and had a pleasant texture. </p>



<p>“I like this.”</p>



<p>We stayed like that for a while, basking in our happiness. I wished this moment could last a lifetime.</p>



<p><em>“A high schooler thinking about marriage, you’re quite the romantic,”</em> the words Sayu had said at karaoke suddenly crossed my mind. </p>



<p>My rational self in the corner of my head retorted, <em>“I know that much.”</em></p>



<p>To meet during our youthful high school days and continue to live together until the end of our lives. In this era, that in itself was a miraculous feat. The declarations of ‘forever together’ and ‘eternal love’ from high school couples sounded light and unrealistic given the harsh realities that lie ahead.</p>



<p>No matter how sincere our current feelings were, they could easily shatter with trivial reasons. Once the anxiety started, it would never end. That’s why Yorka’s words brought genuine comfort from the depths of my heart.</p>



<p>“At karaoke, thanks for saying you want to be together with me forever.”</p>



<p>Surely, Yorka must share the same sentiment. Amidst the euphoria of love, there was also an uncertainty about the future. Yet, expressing one’s true feelings was crucial, no matter how uncertain it all seemed.</p>



<p>“Don’t ever forget it.”</p>



<p>“It left an impression.”</p>



<p>Those words were unforgettable for a man.</p>



<p>“…It’s just my true feelings.”</p>



<p>“I feel the same way.”</p>



<p>“Yeah.” </p>



<p>Our bond, Yorka’s and mine, grew stronger. I could sense it.</p>



<p>“Yorka, tomorrow marks the start of Golden Week, right? How about we go somewhere during the break, just the two of us?” I finally brought up the idea of the holiday date I had been contemplating. Yorka slowly lifted her face. Her expression seemed genuinely apologetic.</p>



<p>“You see, I’ll be in overseas for the entire Golden Week, I’m going to a family trip to a southern island.”</p>



<p>“Overseas!?”</p>



<p>That’s right. My girlfriend was quite rich. They likely planned this trip around their daughters’ vacation.</p>



<p>“I really want to stay in Japan with you, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>“So, you’re asking for a hug in advance for the time we won’t see each other during Golden Week?”</p>



<p>“We haven’t been apart this long since we started dating. It makes me a bit anxious…” Even before the trip, she was more concerned about me than herself.</p>



<p>“Just the fact that you think about it makes me happy. Don’t worry about me.”</p>



<p>“There’s a time difference, and I don’t know if the internet will always be connected, but I’ll make sure to keep in touch regularly!” Yorka pleaded earnestly.</p>



<p>“It’s a special overseas trip. Don’t fret about your phone signal; make sure to enjoy it to the fullest. And then, tell me all about it when you’re back.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, got it.”</p>



<p>“When do you depart? And when’s your return?”</p>



<p>“I leave early tomorrow and will be back on the last night of Golden Week. Sorry for not bringing it up sooner.”</p>



<p>“Don’t apologize for that. Our dates can wait.”</p>



<p>“When the trip was decided, I never imagined we’d become a couple…” Yorka tried to justify.</p>



<p>“I feel the same. If I had known I could date you, I would have skipped my family vacation too. So, let’s agree that during Golden Week, family comes first for both of us. No issues there.”</p>



<p>“Thank you. Make sure you have a good time too, Kisumi.”</p>



<p>No matter how advanced communication technology became, it couldn’t match the joy of meeting face to face. While it was inevitable, saying it wouldn’t be lonely would be a lie.</p>



<p>“Wait, you’re leaving tomorrow morning and you still went to karaoke today? Will you be ready in time?”</p>



<p>“I’m used to it, so I’ve already packed.”</p>



<p>“As expected of Yorka… Sorry, this probably isn’t the best time for karaoke.”</p>



<p>Yorka must have wanted to spend today alone with me.</p>



<p>“Well, you have friends and plans too. It wouldn’t be fair to disrupt it just for my convenience.”</p>



<p>Her consideration made me flutter inside.</p>



<p>“It’s okay. You don’t need to hold back with me.” I hugged her delicate and seemingly fragile body even more gently, as if afraid it might break.</p>



<p>“I’ve already relied on you quite a bit.”</p>



<p>“Yorka, let’s plan a proper hoilday date when you come back.”</p>



<p>“Yeah, I’m looking forward to our day off together.”</p>



<p>To make up for the time we wouldn’t see each other during Golden Week, we shared a long hug before I escorted Yorka to the station. After passing through the ticket gate, I waved until her figure disappeared. </p>



<p>She glanced back at me repeatedly, seeming reluctant to leave. Parting with your lover was always a bit lonely.</p>



<p>The next morning, I woke up earlier than usual.</p>



<p>“I wonder if Yorka is at Narita airport now… She’s probably boarding soon.”</p>



<p>I mumbled toward the ceiling while lying in bed.</p>



<p>“It feels like the start of spring break again.”</p>



<p>The feeling of constantly thinking about Yorka during our time apart. Back then, I didn’t even have her contact information, so I felt completely cornered. Compared to that, the current situation was much better.</p>



<p>“…At least I should send a message to wish her a safe trip.”</p>



<p>I reached for my phone on the bedside table and swiftly send a message. Shortly after, a reply popped up.</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Were you up all night? Couldn’t sleep?</em></p>



<p>Seems like I gave her the wrong idea.</p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>No, I slept fine. Just woke up at this hour. Are you boarding the plane now?</em></p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Yeah, I just settled into my seat.</em></p>



<p>That meant she should be turning off her phone soon. I was glad I made it in time.</p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>Have a safe trip. Enjoy your holiday.</em></p>



<p>Sending what I intended to be a final one, I set the phone aside. Just as I was about to doze off again, Yorka sent a photo at the last moment.</p>



<p>“This is─!!”</p>



<p>My drowsiness vanished in an instant when I sat up in bed. It was a photo of Yorka dressed as a flight attendant from yesterday.</p>



<p>Come to think of it, I vaguely recalled she was being persuaded by Miyachi to take some pictures. Despite feeling embarrassed in an unfamiliar outfit, Yorka managed a perfect pose for the camera. This cute treasure of a photo brought a smile to my face.</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>This one’s special. Don’t get lonely while I’m away. Take care!</em></p>



<p>Overwhelmed with joy and embarrassment, I couldn’t stop grinning. The happiness of acquiring a once-in-a-lifetime treasure and my feelings for her flooded in simultaneously.</p>



<p>I opened the curtains and windows of the room. It looked like another beautiful day.</p>



<p>“Ah… I really want to see her right now.”</p>



<p>As I gazed at the photo, I thought about Yorka soaring through the skies. I couldn’t wait for our holiday date.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>2</strong></p>


<p>Golden Week flew by in the blink of an eye once it started.</p>



<p>I spent the first half of vacation leisurely at home, and the latter part was a two-night, three-day family trip. The destination was a hot spring. Because my sister Ei was still young, our parents wanted to take the whole family around during this period.</p>



<p>“Kisumi-kun, Dad says we’re leaving soon… What are you looking at? Show it to Ei too!” Ei barged into the room without knocking. She leaped onto me, who was lying on the bed, without any reservation. Being a fourth-grader, she was surprisingly tall and had a mature appearance. Although her feminine body was growing, she was still very much an innocent child at heart.</p>



<p>“Hey, get off! It’s too early for you! Also, call me ‘onii-chan’!”</p>



<p>Whenever I had a free time, I’d look at Yorka in her flight attendant costume while my sister would frolic around. Having my little sister saw such photo would undermine my dignity as an older brother.</p>



<p>“You’ve been glued to your smartphone lately. Pay more attention to Ei!”</p>



<p>“Okay, okay. We’re leaving soon, so let me put on my coat first.”</p>



<p>Despite her age, Ei, who’s developing quite well, proved to be a bit of a handful. Dealing with a tall and big girl was quite the challenge.</p>



<p>I searched for a light coat to wear from the hanger rack.</p>



<p>“Hey, Kisumi-kun, is this the plastic-wrapped one your middle school uniform? Will Ei wear this when she becomes a middle schooler?”</p>



<p>Finding it amusing for some reason, she deliberately came over to watch me choose my coat. My diligent mother had taken the liberty of sending my middle school uniform to the dry cleaners. Of course, I had no occasion to wear it anymore, so it remained covered in a transparent vinyl.</p>



<p>“Girls wear sailor uniforms.”</p>



<p>“The one Sayu-chan wore?”</p>



<p>“Exactly. Also, Sayu went to the same high school as me. Surprised, right?”</p>



<p>“Is she wearing that cute uniform like Yorka-chan?”</p>



<p>Although she was still a child, Ei was also a girl. She seemed to have her own fashion preferences and was quite particular about it. Therefore, she knew very well that Eisei’s uniform was stylish.</p>



<p>When I was in elementary school, I only wore clothes provided by my parents. I didn’t have any memories of being picky about fashion.</p>



<p>“That’s right.”</p>



<p>“Ei wants to wear the same one!”</p>



<p>“If you want to wear the same uniform as Yorka, you better study hard to get into Eisei.”</p>



<p>“Ei is good at studying. She always get perfect scores on tests.”</p>



<p>Indeed, despite her foolish antics, Ei excelled in academics. With impressive focus when needed and a reasonably good memory, her report card consistently earning straight A’s.</p>



<p>Our parents called us from downstairs. After putting on my coat and slinging a packed backpack over my shoulders, Ei and I descended the stairs.</p>



<p>During the trip, I intended to leave Ei’s care to our parents and focus on being the luggage carrier and camera operator. However, old habits die hard. I couldn’t take my eyes off my usually energetic sister and ended up being dragged around the whole time.</p>



<p>Whenever there was a food stall, she’d say ‘<em>I</em> <em>want to eat this</em>‘. If there was a place to sell souvenirs, she’d say<em> ‘I want that’.</em></p>



<p><em>‘I’m tired’. ‘I want to go to toilet’. ‘Let’s have more fun’. ‘I want that’. ‘I want this’. ‘I want more’.</em></p>



<p>Thanks to our parents spoiling her incessantly, Ei seemed to thoroughly enjoy herself. When she looked a bit sleepy, my mother insisted, “<em>Kisumi, give Ei a piggyback ride</em>.”</p>



<p>It was quite exhausting to carry a primary school girl on my back. Near my ear, I heard the soothing sounds of Ei’s peaceful breathing. To top it off, our parents casually mentioned, “<em>Kisumi and Ei are such close siblings</em>.”</p>



<p>Ei woke up during dinner and happily played around again in a yukata, while I, on the other hand, suffered from a slight muscle ache. I escaped to the open-air bath and finally got some alone time.</p>



<p>I wonder how Yorka is spending her time under a foreign sky. The more we couldn’t meet, the more I found myself thinking about her.</p>



<p>“Love just grows within oneself, huh?”</p>



<p>Perhaps due to the lukewarm water, I couldn’t help but feel sentimental. Though I was occupied with Ei during the day, when I was alone, my thoughts invariably drifted back to Yorka. I soaked in the warm water while gazing at the starry sky for a long time.</p>



<p>After stepping out of the bath and changing into a yukata, I took a leisurely break in the cooling-off area. On a whim, I decided to send Yorka a photo of the milk I drank after the bath.</p>



<p>“Considering the time difference, maybe I’ll get a reply tomorrow.”</p>



<p>As I relaxed, scrolling through my phone until my body cooled down, a LINE message arrived right on cue.</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Did you put your hand on your hip when you drank the milk?</em></p>



<p>Seeing that message, I chuckled.</p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>Of course (lol).</em></p>



<p>After a while, another notification chimed in. Assuming it was Yorka, I opened the message only to find it was from Yukinami Sayu.</p>



<p><strong>Sayu</strong>: <em>Where are you now? I passed by your house and the lights weren’t on.</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>I’m currently on a hot spring trip.</em></p>



<p><strong>Sayu</strong>: <em>Huh, no way! Are you already on a cozy hot spring trip with Yor-senpai!?</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>Don’t jump to conclusions. It’s a family trip. Yorka is in overseas.</em></p>



<p><strong>Sayu</strong>: <em>Wow, sounds nice. How’s the hot spring?</em></p>



<p>Don’t just nonchalantly steer the conversation back!</p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>It’s a pure bliss. I don’t want to go back.</em></p>



<p><strong>Sayu</strong>: <em>When are you coming back?</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>Ignoring that one, huh?</em></p>



<p><strong>Sayu</strong>: <em>Don’t be an old man about it.</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>It’s a matter of mood.</em></p>



<p><strong>Sayu</strong>: <em>So, when are you coming back? Please answer.</em></p>



<p><strong>Kisumi</strong>: <em>I’ll be back tomorrow night.</em></p>



<p><strong>Sayu</strong>: <em>Roger that.</em></p>



<p>What “roger that” meant was beyond me.</p>



<p><strong>Sayu</strong>: <em>Oh, don’t forget the souvenir! I’ll get mad if you don’t bring one!</em></p>



<p>She’s still demanding as ever!</p>



<p>“She hasn’t changed at all even in high school.”</p>



<p>It had been a while since I messaged Sayu at night. I scrolled through our past conversations and noticed the last exchange was just before last summer.</p>



<p>“I really didn’t reply…”</p>



<p>There, in the past messages, were details about Sayu’s retirement match, the date, location, and how she asked me to cheer for her. Even before realizing I hadn’t replied, I couldn’t recall having read it at all.</p>



<p>Back then, I was mentally strained with the turmoil of whether I’d be ousted from the basketball club. Everything felt daunting, and I had lost all motivation.</p>



<p>No, that’s not it.</p>



<p>It was precisely because I was in such a terrible state that I found myself seeking solace in the art preparation room where Arisaka Yorka spent her time. Talking to her was the only time I could mysteriously forget my troubles. It didn’t take long for me to realize it was because of the budding affection I held for her.</p>



<p>“Oh, Kisumi-kun, there you are! Hurry up and come back!” Pulled along by Ei, who came to fetch me, I finally rose from my spot.</p>



<p>“Come on, Ei. It’s a yukata, not pajamas. Don’t run around too much.”</p>



<p>Ei, in her unfamiliar yukata, was excited, running around the hallway even in her slippers.</p>



<p>“It’s fun because it sways!”</p>



<p>“Don’t move too vigorously; the yukata might come loose. Just stay calm until we reach the room.”</p>



<p>“Eh, then buy me ice cream and I’ll behave.” Without waiting for my response, my sister rushed off to the lobby’s shop. She still had enough pocket change to buy ice cream.</p>



<p>“…After you eat it, brush your teeth again.”</p>



<p>“Yay, ice cream! Häagen-Dazs!”</p>



<p>“They don’t sell that here. Choose something cheaper.”</p>



<p>Although her first-choice luxury ice cream wasn’t available, the ice cream prices here seemed to follow the typical tourist spot markup.</p>



<p>“Give me a bite too.”</p>



<p>“Nope. This one’s Ei’s!”</p>



<p>“I’m the one who bought it.”</p>



<p>“Oh, fine. Just because it’s you, Kisumi-kun.” She scooped out a truly tiny bite with a wooden spoon and offered it to me. Even so, it was refreshingly cold and delicious.</p>



<p>“Give me a bit more. Also, call me ‘onii-chan’ properly.”</p>



<p>“I don’t want both!”</p>



<p><em>I don’t get it. Why won’t my sister call me ‘onii-chan’?</em></p>



<p>While waiting for Ei to finish her ice cream, I receive a message from Yorka. I checked the image she sent along with the message.</p>



<p>“Bwahaha!”</p>



<p>I burst out laughing.</p>



<p>“What’s wrong?” Ei looked at me curiously.</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s nothing…”</p>



<p>Suppressing my pounding heart like crazy, I maintained composure and thoroughly read the message. The sender was indeed Yorka. However, the content was not from her.</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>Be grateful, Boyfriend-kun. From Yor-chan’s big sis.</em></p>



<p>The attached image revealed Yorka in a swimsuit, standing on a tropical white sandy beach. Presumably, Yorka’s big sister secretly took the photo.</p>


<p>Yorka wasn’t looking at the camera. The dense shadow of a beach parasol fell in the foreground, revealing the beautifully slender legs of the photographer, presumably Yorka’s sister who was lying on a chair beneath it.</p>



<p>“Nevertheless…”</p>



<p>Yorka had a stunning figure that took your breath away. Despite being slender, she had a well-defined body. Not to mention the ample volume in her chest, her buttocks were quite impressive too. Moreover, the swimsuit seemed surprisingly small in terms of fabric coverage.</p>



<p>The memory of touching her soft skin during her recent stay at my house resurfaced, making my imagination run wild.</p>



<p><em>Yorka’s big sis, thank you very much!</em></p>



<p>After a while, another message arrived from Yorka.</p>



<p><strong>Yorka</strong>: <em>My sister sent that image without permission!! Delete it right now!! Erase it!! Please!!</em></p>



<p>Seems like she noticed her sister’s mischief. Sorry, but I saved the image right away.</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><strong>3</strong></p>


<p>There was only one day left until the end of Golden Week. The Sena family, which returned home last night, was spending their last day of vacation in their own ways.</p>



<p>My parents went out for shopping a while ago and wouldn’t be back until evening. With nothing particular to do, I lounged on the living room sofa in my casual wear.</p>



<p>I checked the overseas weather on my phone and saw that Yorka’s travel destination seemed to be having a storm.</p>



<p>“I hope it doesn’t affect her flight…”</p>



<p>School started again tomorrow. While it was a shame that the vacation was over, at least I’d finally get to see Yorka. As I absentmindedly scrolled through Yorka’s photos, which had become my routine, the doorbell rang.</p>



<p>“Ki-senpai, let’s play!”</p>



<p>“Are you in elementary school?”</p>



<p>When I opened the front door, there was Yukinami Sayu, clad in her everyday clothes. Despite being sporty and casual, her fashion was on point. She intentionally wore an oversized outer, revealing her left shoulder. The inner sleeveless shirt had a short hem and offered a glimpse of her belly button. She paired it with considerably short shorts, unabashedly showcasing her slender ankles in sneakers with a thick sole.</p>



<p>“Wow, such a laid-back holiday style. Going all out with jersey and T-shirt, aren’t you too casual?”</p>



<p>“It’s comfy, so it’s good enough.”</p>



<p>“You’re brave to show up in public like that.”</p>



<p>This must be the reason for the LINE message from Sayu during my trip.</p>



<p>“It’s a surprise! I came to see you casually like a friendly neighbor!” Sayu tilted her head cutely and smiled. Judging from her makeup and outfit, it didn’t seem like she casually dropped by on a whim.</p>



<p>“Now, change your clothes and let’s go out. You probably thought of spending the last day relaxing at home, right? That’s too naive! Isn’t a holiday meant for going all out and having fun? Come on, if you can’t choose an outfit, I’ll coordinate it for you. Excuse me!”</p>



<p>“No, don’t just naturally walk into my house.”</p>



<p>“Um, are you telling me to wait outside until you’re ready? How cruel.”</p>



<p>“To begin with, I haven’t agreed to go anywhere.”</p>



<p>As we chatted at the entrance, Ei noticed and sprinted over, “Oh, it’s Sayu-chan!”</p>



<p>“Ei-chan! How are you? You’re super cute today too!”</p>



<p>Ei and Sayu rejoiced, their hands clasped together. Whenever Sayu and Ei met like this, the atmosphere became lively with their cheerful chatter.</p>



<p>“Are Kisumi-kun and Sayu-chan going somewhere? Take Ei with you too!” Ei assumed that if it was Sayu, she would naturally say yes.</p>



<p>“Hey, Ei. Don’t go saying unreasonable things. Be a good girl and stay at home with me.”</p>



<p>“Huh? Come on, Ki-senpai, are you really not going?”</p>



<p>“I can’t leave my little sister alone.”</p>



<p>“Siscon!”</p>



<p>“I’m just security-conscious.”</p>



<p>“Boo! Then let’s all go together, Ei-chan too! That should be fine, right?” Sayu pushed a bit forcefully.</p>



<p>“Agreed!” Ei immediately sided with Sayu, “Ei wants to practice badminton. She had been playing a lot with her friends lately!”</p>



<p>Ei grabbed the badminton racket and shuttlecock from the shelf by the entrance, appealing to us. <em>Is she a kid?</em> Oh, right, she’s in fourth grade. Well, that explains it.</p>



<p>Sayu seemed momentarily surprised, but then quickly agreed with Ei, “Alright, let’s play!”</p>



<p>Then both of them stared at my face.</p>



<p>“…Fine. I’ll accompany you to the nearby park.”</p>



<p>“Indeed, Ki-senpai. You’re really soft on Ei-chan!” Sayu looked satisfied with that.</p>



<p>“By the way, I got you hot spring manju as a souvenir.”</p>



<p>“Why would you give that to a high school girl?”</p>



<p>“If you don’t like it, then I won’t bother.”</p>



<p>“I’ll take them! I’ll take them! I love sweets!” Sayu hurriedly expressed her interest.</p>



<p>“Ei tried them too and it was delicious.”</p>



<p>“Really? I’m looking forward to Ei-chan’s recommendation, then.”</p>



<p>Sayu and Ei laughed together like sisters in perfect sync.</p>



<p>“I’ll bring them after I change.”</p>



<p>“Oh, it’s scorching out there, I’ll just grab them later on the way back.”</p>



<p>“Got it.” I quickly headed to my room to change. </p>



<p>The weather was clear today. Since we’d be moving around, I opted for slim black ankle pants paired with a white crewneck t-shirt. I threw on a lightweight jacket to complete the look and finished with my well-worn white Nike Air Force 1s.</p>



<p>When I returned to the entrance, Sayu inspected my outfit.</p>



<p>“A clean, simple, and not-too-sporty look. I’ll give it a passing grade.”</p>



<p>“Enough with the fashion check.”</p>



<p>“It’s just that being with someone who dresses badly can kill the mood, you know? Also, are you still wearing those sneakers?”</p>



<p>“Right, I got these when we went shopping together, didn’t I?”</p>



<p>Being part of a sports club meant wearing out gear frequently. Even the sneakers I was currently wore were an impromptu purchase during a shopping trip with Sayu.</p>



<p>“Wow, I gave you all that advice and recommendations because you were torn about them. How could you forget? That’s mean.”</p>



<p>“I’ve been wearing them a lot because I like them. I wash them regularly too.”</p>
